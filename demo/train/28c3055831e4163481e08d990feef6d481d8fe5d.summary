@entity0 , @entity1 -- early signs of recovery mixed with stormy forecasts friday , as residents struggled to dig out of the most significant flood to hit the lower @entity9 valley in more than 70 years			1
in @entity11 , @entity1 , two casinos reopened after being shut for almost three weeks because of the flooding , said @entity13 , the company that owns and operates them			1
but farther south , @entity0 residents face a long and slow goodbye to the historic flood that submerged much of their city , forecasters said			1
they predicted that the river could remain out of its banks until at least mid-june			1
the @entity9 is not expected to return to its 43 - foot flood stage in @entity0 until after june 14 , which is 46 days after it climbed out of its banks , said @entity26 , a @entity27 hydrologist			1
it crested at 57.1 feet thursday , and the weather service predicts the crest will hold through at least saturday morning in @entity0			1
severe storms are likely saturday and sunday in the @entity9 , @entity32 and @entity34 valleys , said @entity2 meteorologist @entity35			1
up to 3 inches of rain per hour are possible , with heavier storms on sunday			1
the rain could lead to secondary crests and higher crests along the @entity1 from @entity42 , @entity43 , southward , he said			1
some greeted the cresting floodwaters -- which have damaged hundreds of homes and displaced 2,000 @entity0 residents -- with relief			1
@entity50 , who owns a waterfront restaurant , threw a " @entity52 " on thursday night			2
it was a big success , he said			2
" usually we 've got a good crowd , but nothing like it is now			2
we 're probably 200 people more than we usually are , " @entity50 told @entity2 affiliate @entity58			2
" there 's tourists here			2
people from all over the state just coming to see the water			2
they 've never seen anything like it			2
" the patrons also included area evacuees such as @entity70 of @entity71			2
" ( i 'm ) just here to celebrate the river cresting , " @entity72 said			2
" hopefully , it 'll start going down soon			2
" all but about a dozen of @entity71 's 600 residents evacuated , according to @entity2 affiliate @entity78			2
" we talked about it and thought about it , but this really was n't a decision at all , " one of the holdouts , @entity83 , told @entity78			0
this is where our stuff is			0
" local officials caution that some area residents may have to wait to return to their homes			0
flooded houses pose a variety of dangers , they said			0
rising floodwaters bring on debris , hazardous waste and gas leaks , and force snakes or other potentially dangerous animals from their habitats and into residential areas			1
" right now we 're moving to the recovery stage , " @entity0 mayor @entity101 told @entity2			1
" our first priority , i believe , should be public safety , to continue to encourage our residents and onlookers to stay free of the water			0
" law enforcement officials are patrolling evacuated areas to help ensure that abandoned homes and businesses are n't burglarized , @entity101 said			0
and each flooded property must be assessed before an owner can return to it , he said			0
residents who live along the river should be vigilant , said @entity118 , a senior hydrologist with the weather service			0
@entity121 , which includes @entity0 , has " several hundred homes that have water " and about 2,000 residents have been displaced , sheriff @entity120 said			1
county residents are accustomed to flooding and know what to do , but none have experienced it at this magnitude , according to @entity120			0
the river began cresting ahead of schedule wednesday night , probably because an old levee system in the @entity1 city of @entity135 was breached may 13 and spread the flood 's flow , @entity118 said			1
the @entity9 is more than 14 feet above flood stage at @entity0 and more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927			1
water levels in @entity143 , a city about 70 miles south , are nearly 4 feet beyond the record			0
the river stood at 61.9 feet thursday night , and the crest is n't expected till saturday			0
the @entity146 kept a watchful eye on the @entity148 , which residents near @entity0 were counting on			1
it is designed to keep water from backing into parts of the @entity153			1
a slide was detected on the mainline @entity1 levee at @entity156 , the @entity146 said thursday			1
that occurs when the integrity of a levee is undermined because dirt and sand are being eroded , said spokeswoman @entity162			0
" it will take about a full week to repair , " she said			0
farther south , where the @entity9 has not yet crested , residents were working to clear out their homes and find ways to get by			1
@entity169 gov. @entity168 has asked for federal assistance in grappling with flooding stemming from the @entity172 , where 17 bays have been opened in hopes of sparing @entity175 farther downstream			0
so far , the @entity178 has delivered nearly 150,000 sandbags , 30,000 cubic yards of sand and 33,000 linear feet of fabric - lined baskets , the governor 's office said			0
approximately 1,150 @entity184 members have been mobilized			0
mandatory evacuations will be in effect saturday -- beginning at midnight friday -- in @entity188 , @entity189 and the @entity190 , the @entity185 said			0
by saturday morning , " the area will be secured and no one will be allowed to enter , " the parish said in a news release			0
officials said spillway gates are likely to be open for weeks			0
it will be weeks before the river falls below flood stage , allowing evacuees to return			0
about five miles of the @entity9 at @entity201 were closed friday after four barges broke loose from a towboat , said seaman @entity204 of the @entity205			1
three of the four sank			0
@entity204 declined to say whether the recent flooding could have had anything to do with the incident , but said an investigation was under way			0
the flood is the most significant to hit the lower @entity9 valley since at least 1937			1
it has affected nine states so far : @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity43 , @entity32 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity169 and @entity1			1
@entity2 's @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .			0
