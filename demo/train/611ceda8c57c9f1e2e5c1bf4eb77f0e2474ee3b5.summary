-- sitting incongruously among the hangars and laboratories of @entity4 's @entity3 in @entity5 is the squat facade of an old @entity7			1
you wo n't get a burger there , though -- its cash registers and soft - serve machines have given way to old tape drives and modern computers run by a rogue team of hacker engineers who 've rechristened the place @entity20 's			1
these self - described techno - archaeologists have been on a mission to recover and digitize forgotten photos taken in the ' 60s by a quintet of scuttled lunar satellites			1
the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) has since 2007 brought some 2,000 pictures back from 1,500 analog data tapes			1
they contain the first high - resolution photographs ever taken from behind the lunar horizon , including the first photo of an earthrise ( first slide above )			1
thanks to the technical savvy and diy engineering of the team at @entity26 , it 's being seen at a higher resolution than was ever previously possible			1
" we 're reaching back to a capability that existed but could n't be touched back when it was created , " says @entity40 , co-lead and founding member at @entity26			1
" it 's like having a dvd in 1966 , you ca n't play it			1
we had resolution of the @entity50 of about a kilometer [ per pixel ]			0
this is an image taken a quarter of a f * * * king million miles away in 1966			2
the @entity54 were warming up to play @entity55 at the moment it was being taken			0
" between 1966 and ' 67 , five @entity58 snapped pictures onto 70mm film from about 30 miles above the moon			1
the satellites were sent mainly to scout potential landing sites for manned moon missions			2
each satellite would point its dual lens @entity67 camera at a target , snap a picture , then develop the photograph			0
high - and low - resolution photos were then scanned into strips called framelets using something akin to an old fax machine reader			1
the images were beamed in modulated signals to one of three receiving stations in @entity81 , @entity82 , or @entity83 , where the pictures -- and collateral chatter from the @entity4 operators -- were recorded straight to tape			1
after finishing their missions , the satellites were unceremoniously dashed against the moon rocks , clearing the way for @entity92			2
the brilliant and ballsy engineering was typical of @entity4 during its golden age , a time when it was also more closely linked to other government agencies with an interest in taking pictures from space			1
" these guys were operating right at the edge , " @entity40 says with a reverence for these @entity4 engineers that 's shared by his team			1
" there 's a certain spy program heritage to all this , but these guys went above that , because those spy satellites would send their images back			2
they were in lunar orbit			0
" fascinating ways people try to leave their @entity116 on the @entity117 the photos were stored with remarkably high fidelity on the tapes , but at the time had to be copied from projection screens onto paper , sometimes at sizes so large that warehouses and even old churches were rented out to hang them up			2
the results were pretty grainy , but clear enough to identify landing sites and potential hazards			0
after the low - fi printing , the tapes were shoved into boxes and forgotten			2
they changed hands several times over the years , almost getting tossed out before landing in storage in @entity137 , @entity83			0
several abortive attempts were made to recover data from the tapes , which were well kept , but it was n't until 2005 that @entity4 engineer @entity40 and space entrepreneur @entity142 were able to bring the materials and the technical know how together			1
when they learned through a @entity147 that former @entity4 employee @entity148 might have both the tapes and the super-rare @entity151 - 900 drives needed to read them , they jumped into action			1
they drove to @entity155 , where the refrigerator - sized drives were being stored in a backyard shed surrounded by chickens			2
at the same time , they retrieved the tapes from a storage unit in nearby @entity137 , and things gradually began to take shape			0
funding the project out of pocket at first , they were consumed with figuring out how to release the images trapped in the tapes			1
" we 're both @entity92 babies , so the moon to us was something that 's unfinished business , " says @entity40			2
" these tapes were sealed for history by somebody who cared , and it was astonishing the condition they were in			0
so we started buying used parts on @entity180 , @entity181 -- i was sitting at a black - tie reception at one point buying something on my @entity186			2
we just buy and reassemble these things bit by bit			0
" the drives had to be rebuilt and in some cases completely re-engineered using instruction manuals or the advice of people who used to service them			0
the data they recovered then had to be demodulated and digitized , which added more layers of technical difficulties			2
the resulting framelets had to be individually reassembled in @entity200			0
after kluging through countless engineering problems ( try finding a chemical substitute for whale oil to lubricate tape heads ) , the @entity26 team was able to single out and reproduce the famous earthrise image			1
this proof of concept brought the first @entity4 funding in 2008 , and the team recently completed processing the entire tape collection			1
" we 're the first people out of a generation or more to see this , " says @entity40			0
" no human eye had ever seen this			0
all they saw was something that had already been through one generation of copying			0
we 're seeing something one order of magnitude more precise right on the screen			0
" since the ' 60s , a series of @entity50 and moon imaging satellites have launched , including the @entity227 in 2009			2
despite the advances in computing power and optics , @entity40 says the terabytes of images recovered at @entity26 are often even more detailed than those taken by @entity227 , capable of being blown up to billboard size without losing resolution			1
" a lot of the images they 're taking today , our imagery from 1966 and ' 67 has sometimes greater resolution and greater dynamic range because of the way the pictures were taken			1
so sometimes you look into a shadow in a picture that @entity227 's taken , and you do n't see any detail -- with ours , you do			0
" officially named @entity248 , @entity250 's flies a flag bearing the distinct @entity253 skull and crossbones , signaling the team 's hacker ethic			0
the seven or so people tinkering away inside maintain an open - source mentality about their work , making all images and their technological discoveries free to the public			1
they also have plans for a decommissioned @entity264 that 's sitting outside ( for students , of course )			0
@entity250 's has grown into a highly specialized operation , stuffed with a melange of old and new technology now put to use in decoding various @entity4 and @entity271 tapes that no one knows what to do with			1
with a built - in ability to handle hazardous chemicals , the old @entity274 's made practical sense , but it also gave them a layer of distance to carry out their weird work			2
" i had a choice between the barbershop and this building -- we did n't really care what sort of building they gave us , we just did n't want to pay for it , " @entity40 says			0
" the surplus folks at @entity3 where all the old computers and stuff go , they love us because we come over and make all the old stuff work			0
the safety guys come by and we usually either make them our friends or bark at them and they do n't come back			0
" the images gathered at @entity26 have been coerced into providing even more information than they were intended to			1
their data have been used to correct figures from the time about @entity50 's arctic ice levels , and have helped identify an @entity307 - type event in the ' 60s			2
all the images and the information gathered from them are being fed into the @entity311 , an official repository where mission data from @entity227 , @entity314 , @entity315 , and many others are documented			2
started by the same @entity148 that provided the tape drives , the @entity311 did n't exist when the @entity26 pictures were initially taken			1
the images and information that @entity26 has recovered will be submitted as the official record of the original sattelite mission			1
it 's a testament to the lasting work of the engineers who designed the orbiter missions , and the tenacity of the modern techno archaeologists who are bringing that work to full fruition			0
" back then things were designed , even if they failed , to still do something			0
today , most jet fighters would fall out of the sky if they did n't have computers adjusting their surfaces and their pattern thousands of times a second			0
back then they just had to engineer stuff elegantly so that it worked , " he says			0
" we feel that we 're completing the @entity26 1 through 5 missions			1
they never formally submitted their stuff for the archives so we 're doing it			0
