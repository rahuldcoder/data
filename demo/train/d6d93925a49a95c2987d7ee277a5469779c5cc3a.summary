" it is a victory for democracy that proves that our country provides possibilities for all people , " writes @entity2			1
( @entity15 ) -- last night , i like most @entity17 of all stripes , watched with visible goose bumps as history was made			1
i sat with my 13 - year - old son and looked from the screen to his eyes as sen. @entity24 became the first @entity17 in history to lead a @entity28 major - party ticket when he claimed the nomination for the @entity30 for president of the @entity28			1
i congratulate sen. @entity24 on this historic accomplishment			1
i thank him for accepting the torch that was lit by our forefathers and proudly carrying it through the darkness of our struggles , trials and tribulations , bringing light and hope to a new generation , and for facing all those who said " no " and " you ca n't win , " or " it will never happen , " and firmly , proudly , defiantly saying , " yes i can ! " however , what i really hope people take away from that night is that this is not just a victory for @entity17 , it is a victory for democracy that proves that our country provides possibilities for all people			1
it is also a sign that a metamorphosis is in progress			0
today we saw that @entity17 respect experience , but are interested in change			2
i hope that we can somehow merge the best ideas of our differences and emerge with a president who epitomizes our highest and best ideals			0
while it remains unclear where we are going , last night proves that we as a people have moved beyond business as usual			2
i congratulate not just sen. @entity24 on his victory , but the country on this landmark event that has shattered a past all too often filled with reasons to separate us as opposed to a voice of reason to unite us			1
the victory cup does not rest on the shoulders of the senator alone , but to all those who have been able to lift the conversation from petty racism , antiquated cut - throat politics , and fear - based campaigns to the larger issues of how we would like to see our country led into the future and ultimately how our country will be remembered			2
as the days and discussions of this political season continue , it is my sincere hope and prayer that we do not sink back into the abyss of political pettiness that has plagued our country and our lives for so many years			0
i am grateful to sen. @entity100 for giving , through this campaign , a chance for my daughters to see that their femininity is not a liability			0
today both my sons and daughters came to understand that their ethnicity is n't viewed by progressive @entity17 as a limitation or a liability			2
ireport.com : readers ' feelings on @entity24 for me it was almost déjà vu as i sat with my son			0
i remembered a little over 40 years ago watching the famous @entity117 speech with my dad			0
similarly , i watched with my youngest son last night as a historical moment unfolded			0
he and i saw the dreams of slaves come true as the sons of slaves and the slave owners clapped their hands in one progressive sweep			0
as i drifted into sleep , all i could see was the twinkle in my son 's eyes			0
his eyes were illuminated with possibilities , and his heart was filled with the potential of what is attainable for qualified , competent people of all types who prepare themselves intellectually and are well vested with a divine sensitivity to the " fierce urgency of now ! " congratulations sen. @entity24 .			1
