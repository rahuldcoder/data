-- as a longtime political operative , i know firsthand how a vote here or a vote there can make a huge difference in a close election			0
and as vice president @entity10 's former campaign manager , i understand the impact @entity13 decisions can have on electoral outcomes			1
these two reasons are why i 'm outraged by what 's going on in @entity17			2
this week , the @entity13 , on the eve of early voting , ruled that efforts by @entity21 to restrict early voting days were acceptable			1
this gets rid of what 's called the @entity25 in @entity17 -- the period when voters can register and cast their ballot at the same time			2
it ended convenient voting hours , when @entity31 could vote after a long day at work -- as late as 9 p.m. it also ended voting on one of the two sundays before @entity34 when many folks head to their polling place after church			1
these have been hallmarks of the @entity17 voting system , but the @entity13 and @entity40 have yet again changed the rules in the middle of the game -- all to create barriers between people and the ballot box			1
and unfortunately it 's not just @entity17 where @entity40 have doggedly tried to restrict or cut early voting days or hours			1
in @entity49 , gov. @entity48 and the @entity40 have reduced and limited the early voting period , including weekend voting			1
in @entity53 , the @entity40 governor and legislature took away a week of early voting			1
and in @entity56 , a @entity40 legislator lamented a county 's move to expand early voting , saying he would " prefer more educated voters " over black early voters			1
think this does n't have any real impact ? think again			0
in 2012 , a third of voters cast a ballot before @entity34 , in person or by mail -- more than double the rate during the 2000 election			0
all told , more than 18 million voters cast an early in - person ballot when president @entity72 was re-elected			0
voting should n't be a challenge			0
it should be as easy and accessible as possible			0
we should n't require forms of @entity78 that folks do n't have , we should n't restrict days or hours that allow working people a chance to both do their job and exercise their democratic right , and we damn well should n't be throwing up new obstacles midstream			1
when obstacles are thrown up , we should have protections for voters			0
that 's why i was so frustrated when the @entity13 last summer gutted the @entity92 in @entity93			2
the @entity13 ruled that there 's no need for national oversight when localities and states with a history of racially discriminatory voting laws make voting rule changes			1
i 'm not alone with my frustration			0
a recent poll from @entity104 and the @entity105 found that nationally , 69 % of the @entity107 public favors restoring the @entity92 , with only 10 % opposing			0
voters of both parties , all races , and every region across the country favor a congressional proposal to restore the @entity92			0
i 'm hopeful that @entity40 and @entity119 will , in the lame duck session after the 2014 elections or in the beginning of the next session of @entity118 , hammer out legislation that restores oversight and protects voters			2
as @entity119 , we believe in giving every eligible citizen the opportunity to vote -- whether it 's early because they ca n't take off work on @entity34 or absentee because they might have plans to be out of town			0
and we believe this for two reasons			0
first , when more people vote , @entity119 win			1
that 's because more @entity107 agree with us on the big issues and the big questions -- like who 's got my back ? but second , it 's because our democracy is better when more people have skin in the game			2
our democracy relies on participation and we 've never done better by excluding folks			1
if there 's one thing we can count on , it 's that the @entity40 is going to continue to come up with last minute schemes to make it more complicated , more confusing , or just plain more difficult for honest , hardworking citizens to vote on @entity34 or before			2
it 's up to us to stop them .			0

@entity13 ruled @entity17 could restrict early voting ; other @entity40 states have also done it
@entity161 : court ruling also ends convenient hours that help working people vote
@entity161 : more and more people vote early , so @entity40 efforts to *discourage* it has big impact
@entity161 : democracy relies on participation ; we 've never done better by excluding folks
