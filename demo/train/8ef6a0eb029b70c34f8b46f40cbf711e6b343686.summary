@entity0 -- political operatives are pushing pot legalization in several states this year in the hopes of sparking high turnout in this fall 's midterm elections , and are looking ahead to 2016 as well			1
if voters approve a closely - watched ballot initiative in november , @entity9 could become the first @entity13 state to allow medical marijuana			1
and voters in @entity16 and @entity17 — two states that already allow medical marijuana and have decriminalized harsh sentencing for some recreational use — will likely vote on whether to join @entity22 and @entity0 in allowing , taxing and regulating pot for recreational use			1
a look at marijuana laws in the @entity27 there 's not much of a smoke screen shrouding as to why some @entity32 political strategists would want marijuana measures on ballots this year given president @entity36 's low approval numbers and the party 's historic slump in terms of turnout in midterm election years , marijuana policy analysts said			1
' @entity43 adults and legalization ' " it 's nothing but politics , " said @entity45 , an assistant professor of criminal justice at @entity47			2
" if anyone 's electoral strategy is to bring out new voters , one area they would target is young adults and marijuana legalization			1
" that 's because people under 30 are more likely to use and be arrested for pot , @entity45 said			2
and , he added , young voter attitudes about legalizing marijuana also tends to cut across political ideologies and includes a cross section of liberals and libertarians			2
according to a @entity68 poll conducted in february , 70 % of respondents between 18 and 29 believe marijuana should be legalized			2
comparatively , 32 % of people 65 and older support legalization			0
so , political operatives and their well - heeled backers have sallied forth , in part , with the hopes of hooking those elusive young voters with the allure of legalizing marijuana			0
for example , @entity78 's petition drive , which the @entity79 said is gaining steam , is funded by @entity78			0
the group last year received $ 50,000 from the @entity83 , an organization with ties to billionaire and pro-marijuana legalization advocate @entity86			0
@entity16 's @entity88 in tight race in @entity16 , " the finances were right " to put money and effort into getting a ballot initiative , said @entity90 , director of federal policies for the @entity92 , a pro-pot legalization group			2
in that state , @entity32 sen. @entity88 is in a competitive race to keep his seat			0
those who oppose marijuana legalization balk at the influence of big cash and election year pushes			1
" it has n't been a fair fight in terms of messaging			0
they 've spent over $ 100 million to advocate this , " said @entity110 , an assistant professor at the @entity112 's @entity111			0
" it speaks to the money in marijuana politics			0
" pot politics " you have special interest groups lobbying , pollsters , public relations and marijuana companies that are funding this			2
they stand to make a lot of money if ( marijuana legalizes nationally ) , " said @entity110 who served as a drug policy adviser to both @entity127 and @entity32 administrations and is on the board of directors of @entity129 , an anti-pot legalization group			2
" this is about creating the next big tobacco and getting rich off of other people 's addictions			0
" in the effort to get marijuana - related ballot initiatives , pro-pot legalization advocates have also netted the support of older voters who perhaps may be more likely to suffer from ailments they hope marijuana can alleviate , and those who were born during the 1960s and 70s and bore witness to looser cultural attitudes about drug use , marijuana policy experts said			1
drawing voters to polls pot measures are more likely to draw voters to the polls , said @entity160 , a political management professor at @entity161 who helped conduct a national poll in late march examining the issue			1
according to the poll " 39 % of surveyed voters reported that they would be much more likely to turn out to the polls if there was a proposal to legalize the use of marijuana on the ticket			0
an additional 30 % said that they would be somewhat more likely to vote in the election under that circumstance			0
" according to the poll , 40 % of @entity127 and 39 % of @entity32 say they would be strongly more likely to turn out , @entity160 said			0
a @entity1 / @entity177 poll conducted in january found that a little more than half of those surveyed — 55 % — supports marijuana legalization			1
this is an increase from the 16 % who supported legalization a quarter century ago			0
legal in 21 states , @entity186 medical marijuana is legal in 21 states and the @entity186 , according to the @entity79			1
this year , 18 state governments had measures dealing with legalizing marijuana for recreational use , according to @entity79			1
some 15 states considered whether to create new medical marijuana laws , 14 weighed creating new medical marijuana programs and 14 considered decriminalizing marijuana , according to an analysis of current state marijuana legislation efforts performed by the @entity79 for @entity1			1
majority in @entity22 say legalizing pot was good for state fewer than a dozen of the measures have been enacted , the analysis found			1
meanwhile , the politics of putting an initiative on the ballot to legalize medical marijuana in @entity9 has proven hazy indeed			1
@entity207 running in @entity9 wealthy @entity209 trial attorney @entity208 is helping bankroll not only the pot ballot initiative push and voter turnout efforts , but also the campaign of former gov. @entity207 , a @entity127 - turned - @entity214 , in his effort to reclaim that office			1
@entity208 said he poured $ 4 million of his own money into the ballot effort to help people like his brother , who is a quadriplegic , and his father , who died from esophageal cancer , whose suffering was eased by medical marijuana			1
@entity127 have cried foul over the connection and say @entity32 operatives are just using pot as a ploy to turnout votes for @entity207			2
" i love @entity207 and i like @entity207 , but i do n't like him $ 4 million dollars worth , " @entity208 told @entity1			0
@entity230 , the @entity208 - backed organization behind the initiative also said the @entity127 is blowing smoke			0
" it 's a very cynical argument , " said @entity233 , the group 's director and a @entity32 fundraiser who is also helping raise campaign cash for @entity207			0
" that has nothing to do with what we 're doing			0
" meanwhile , @entity243 gov. @entity243 , who trails @entity207 in the polls , stunned observers last week when , despite previously stating his opposition to legalizing medical marijuana , he vowed to sign into law a bill legalizing a limited version of the drug for some medicinal purposes			1
a @entity254 poll conducted in late april found that 88 % of @entity9 voters support legal medical marijuana use by adults , backing that was high among both young and elderly respondents			1
while advocates reject claims from the other side that they are being politically manipulative , they do acknowledge that politicians looking for a bump at the polls might do well to align themselves with the pro-pot legalization cause			2
the 2016 play with an eye on the 2016 elections , @entity90 's organization is already anticipating backing initiatives to tax and regulate marijuana for that year 's ballot in @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 and possibly @entity279			2
his organization 's efforts " might bring voters to the polls who might favor @entity207 in the election , " @entity90 said adding that politicians might want to take note			0
" it 's important because one of the ways we 're gaining traction in @entity293 is that it is gaining popularity in states			0
@entity9 would be the second most populous marijuana state			1
" guess which politicians have tried pot			0

*critical* *battleground* state of @entity9 , and others , have pot legalization on fall ballots
advocates say marijuana legalization measures could help with youth voter turnout
opponents accuse legalization advocates of using the issue to influence elections
@entity9 's medical marijuana vote this fall could prove a *watershed* moment
