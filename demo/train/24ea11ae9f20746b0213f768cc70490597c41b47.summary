@entity0 -- a controversial proposal to build a giant oil pipeline between @entity4 , @entity5 , and @entity6 cleared a key hurdle friday as the @entity8 said the project could be built without significant damage to the environment			1
known as @entity13 , the 1,700 - mile pipeline has drawn fierce criticism from environmentalists , who are staging a two - week demonstration at the @entity17			1
so far , some 370 people have been arrested for protesting the project			0
" there would be no significant impacts to most resources along the proposed pipeline corridor , " @entity21 ( @entity22 ) assistant secretary @entity20 told reporters on the release of the @entity8 's final environmental impact statement			1
she stressed that the report is not the last word on the pipeline , which now must pass through a 90 - day review period that will include public hearings			1
a final decision is expected before year - end			2
supporters say the pipeline would create jobs and let the @entity39 replace @entity42 or @entity41 imports with well - regulated , dependable @entity5 crude			1
opponents say the project would bind the country to an unnecessary and dirty form of oil for decades to come and expose surrounding areas to dangerous spills and leaks			0
" it was disappointing , but expected , " @entity52 , a spokesman for the @entity53 , said about the @entity8 's report			0
he is part of a group of activists that has been protesting the pipeline at the @entity17 since august 20			2
some 370 people have been arrested so far and 2,000 are planning to be before the scheduled end of the demonstration on september 3 , he said			0
according to the @entity63 , roughly 50 people have been arrested per day since the start of the demonstration for failure to obey a lawful order			2
" it really does n't make a lick of sense , " @entity52 said about the pipeline			2
" there 's no excuse for not doing the right thing on this			0
" the company that wants to build the pipeline , @entity78 , cheered the @entity8 's report			0
it emphasized the project 's benefits , economic and otherwise			0
" the fundamental issue is energy security			0
through the @entity13 system , the @entity39 can secure access to a stable and reliable supply of oil from @entity5 , where we protect human rights and the environment , or it can import more higher - priced oil from nations who do not share @entity39 's interests or values , " said @entity85 , @entity78 's president and chief executive officer			1
the pipeline would draw from oil sands deposits in @entity5 and pass through @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity6 , with construction on an existing pipeline in @entity107			1
it could transport up to 830,000 barrels per day and is estimated to cost $ 7 billion			1
