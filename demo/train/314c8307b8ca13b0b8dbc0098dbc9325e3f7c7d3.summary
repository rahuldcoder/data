-- we celebrate @entity2 this week , but we have been riding a crest of war remembrance for months now			1
@entity6 's centenary alone has brought forth new books -- histories of that war , based on historical documentation and letters unearthed in family and state archives			1
we look anew at the inscriptions on tombs of known and unknown soldiers and posters from the past whose propagandistic messages shout at us across the divide of time			0
opinion : how a century - old war affects you but in the midst of this flood of words , an equally significant , and telling , aspect of the @entity6 has been largely overlooked : the place of silence in and around the conflict			1
@entity6 may call to mind the written word -- the harrowing verses of @entity33 or the prose of @entity35 , whose " @entity38 " rendered war 's raw brutality			1
but the experiences of the years 1914 - 1918 in fact enshrined the notions that language can not adequately express the experience of combat , that the veteran will often remain silent about war , even to his or her own family , that the speech of soldiers -- the euphemisms and slang used on the battlefield , the coded communications used after , among veterans -- leaves out as much as it reveals			1
opinion : when the flu wiped out millions this notion of war as an inaccessible space may seem almost antiquated today , when civilian smartphones and video cameras produce a continual feed of chaotic combat situations			2
but much of what goes on in military operations remains unknown to those who were not there			0
the connections between silence and war still hold among soldiers -- for reasons of security , censorship , military culture and enduring mechanisms of human psychology			1
opinion : the mighty women of @entity6 in 2014 , as in 1914 , many veterans keep quiet about what are their most life - changing experiences			1
there is , for one thing , the trauma ; there is also the desire to protect one 's family			2
there is guilt over killing -- and guilt over surviving			1
and there is the sheer difficulty of how to explain it : how to put an exceptional state into everyday language			0
opinion : how @entity6 gave us ' cooties ' @entity6 was a watershed in this regard , modeling , during the course of the conflict , what could and could not be said about war by combatants			1
some silences were strategic : soldiers knew their communications home would be censored , and it was unwise to appear defeatist or unpatriotic by conveying the horrors of the battlefield			2
opinion : the promise @entity6 could n't keep others refused speech as a way of respecting the war experience of fallen comrades			1
war poetry is vocal on the need for restraint to counter the rhetoric of heroism produced by those far from the front			0
in his 1915 poem " when you see millions of the @entity141 , " @entity133 scorned the use of " soft words " about those who could not speak back : " say only this , ' they are dead			0
' / then add thereto , / ' yet many a better one has died before			0
' ... " opinion : the ' bionic men ' of @entity6 most combatants could not come up with the words , soft or hard , to communicate to those back home what lay around them : carnage on an unprecedented scale			1
with many new weapons , and others used on a mass scale for the first time in history , @entity6 inaugurated a new human experience of battle and devastating new injuries			1
even the educated felt that language failed them to convey the sights and smells of bodies rent by machine gun fire , devastated by bombs from the air , blistered from gas or paralyzed by shell shock			0
" i can not find words to translate my impressions			0
hell can not be so terrible , " wrote the @entity174 lieutenant @entity173 in his diary , unable to draw comparisons with any known reality			0
opinion : war : what is it good for ? art ! the writings , drawings and other artifacts that flowed from the front grappled not only with the question of how to rise to these expressive challenges , but whether it is even possible to communicate this new reality to the noncombatant			0
opinion : should nations pay the price for their leaders ' misdeeds ? @entity198 reflected on this futility in his 1916 novel " @entity205 , " which originated from notes taken during his time at the front			0
" it 'll be no good telling about it , eh ? they would n't believe you ... no one can know it			0
only us , " remarks one soldier			0
" no , not even us , not even us ! , " another responds			0
" we 've seen too much to remember ... we 're not made to hold it all			0
" traumatic repression , the veterans ' despair at being understood , the affirmation of a special bond of knowledge and experience among comrades -- all familiar struggles from our modern wars			2
they are all here , in 1916 -- violence of a scope that exceeded comprehension			0
indeed , @entity198 's scene ends with the rueful reflection that this war was something " you ca n't give a name to			1
" opinion : the promise @entity6 could n't keep both the modern figure of the literary witness and the modern figure of the mute veteran emerged from this early 20th - century conflagration -- as with @entity198 , they were often one and the same - and with them the notion of war as something too overwhelming to tell			1
opinion : how @entity6 gave us drones of course , this situation was not unique to the @entity6			2
a study released in august by the @entity252 , which reveals the prolonged post-traumatic stress among @entity255 veterans -- home from war for 40 years now -- reminds us of that			2
opinion : how @entity6 gave us drones and so it 's fitting that from 1919 onward , @entity6 's november 11th @entity262 has been marked in many countries through two minutes of silence and has been expanded to include the veterans of all wars			1
the words of @entity6 can enlighten us about the conflict 100 years later			2
but the spaces of silence around the din of all wars can tell us much about war 's toll on those who wage it -- in 2014 as in 1914			1

@entity279 : @entity2 brings words of remembrance . for many , words do n't work
she says vets keep quiet about their life - changing experience ; others would not understand
she says @entity6 enshrined this notion . the horrors , and guilt over killing , too great to describe
@entity295 : it 's fitting @entity2 calls for 2 minutes of silence -- to quietly mark the din of war
