when @entity3 stepped out from behind the cardboard cutout of his former fat self on monday , the audience of " @entity1 " was appropriately shocked			1
the fitness trainer 's journey had come to an end after successfully losing more than 70 pounds -- six months after he purposely gained the same amount			1
" like it never happened , " host @entity10 said			2
" kind of , " @entity3 said			1
both @entity3 and his wife , @entity14 , can attest that a lot actually has changed in the past year			1
while @entity3 's body may have returned to its six - pack heydays , his mind , in many ways , has not			1
always a fitness junkie , staying in shape comes naturally for @entity3			1
he 's that guy at the gym the rest of us love to hate , the one who likes to use his biceps for pumping iron instead of changing channels , and who prefers sucking down a spinach shake to indulging in a brownie sundae			2
because of that , @entity3 was a " judgmental " trainer , his wife says			1
" he would look at someone who was overweight and say , ' they must really be lazy			2
' " i was convinced people used genetics or similar excuses as a crutch , " @entity3 writes in his new book , " @entity42			1
" " you either wanted to be healthy or you did n't			1
" the link between fat and cancer that point of view was n't helping @entity3 help his clients			1
when he failed yet again to push someone over to the light side , he knew something was wrong			2
in order to better understand the struggles his clients were facing , he had to face them himself			1
he gave up the gym and started consuming junk food , fast food and soda			2
in just six months , he went from 193 pounds with a 34 - inch waist to 265 pounds with a 48 - inch waist			1
@entity14 saw the difference in her husband in less time than that			0
he became lethargic , stopped helping around the house and was less than eager to play with their 2 - year - old daughter			0
" he was so insecure -- saying ' i 'm so fat			0
i look so horrible , ' constantly complaining about how he looks , " she said			0
@entity3 says he did n't realize the effects of his weight gain would be more than physical			1
it altered his relationships and his self - confidence			0
returning to the gym after the @entity78 portion of his journey made him nervous			0
the fact that he had to do push - ups on his knees was almost humiliating			0
" the biggest thing [ i learned ] is that it 's not just about the physical			0
it 's not just about the meal plan and the workouts and those things			0
the key is the mental and the emotional issues			0
i realized those issues are real			0
" of course , @entity3 had his critics			1
experts said that his stunt was dangerous			0
his blood pressure and cholesterol shot up with such dramatic weight gain			2
but @entity3 has no regrets			1
the followers on his website have encouraged him with their own tales of weight loss			2
a fat girl gets naked " we see the success stories of people losing all this weight , but it 's more common now , " he says			2
" to see someone do it in reverse on purpose -- it 's mind blowing			2
a balance of craziness and inspiration			0
" @entity3 suffered through soda deprivation headaches and food cravings on his way back to fit			1
the journey was easier for him than for most , he 'll admit , but he 's eager now to provide tips for others to follow in his footsteps			0
power walker loses 150 pounds @entity14 is just glad to have her husband back , maybe a bit better than he was before			1
before @entity42 , the self - described foodie wife would make treats , and @entity3 would n't even look at them			1
" now he craves them , " she says with a laugh			0
" it might be cruel , but i like that			0
i like that he 's humanized			0
" @entity2 's @entity135 contributed to this story .			0
