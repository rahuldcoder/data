-- the small , @entity2 - era plane that crashed friday during a @entity5 , @entity4 , air race was equipped with data and video recording devices that investigators hope to use to help determine what happened and why			1
seven people , including the pilot , were killed when the plane crashed into spectators at the race , with two others later dying at area hospitals			1
close to 70 people were injured			1
@entity19 member @entity18 on sunday described this realization , as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices , as " significant new information			1
" it was also not entirely expected , given the size and nature of the p - 51 aircraft			0
" i 'm not aware of a lot of aircraft having it , this is the first one i came across , " said @entity30 , who is the @entity19 official heading the investigation			1
@entity35 was referring to a " box " that recorded key variables such as altitude , latitude and oil pressure			0
in addition , there was an outward - facing video camera on the plane , according to @entity18			1
several memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device , and will be sent to the @entity19 laboratory in @entity50 , for a full analysis , @entity18 said			1
they may belong to some of the 200,000 spectators then at the annual @entity55 and @entity56			0
investigators do have a copy of the " box " data , since it was sent in real time by telemetry to sources outside the aircraft			1
besides the cards , @entity18 said parts of a plane 's tail , an " elevator trim tab " and video camera fragments have been found			1
" there were thousands of pieces of debris , " @entity30 said , explaining how the site had been laid out in a grid system to help organize the probe			0
as with the memory cards , one of the authorities ' first goals will be to determine if these came from the plane being piloted by 74 - year - old @entity82			1
countering earlier reports , @entity18 said on sunday that @entity82 did not send a " @entity84 , " indicating he was in distress			1
investigators have repeatedly stated that it is not now known why the aircraft nosedived			0
some speculation has surrounded the elevator trim tab -- which was breaking apart prior to the crash , a photograph shows			2
besides the plane 's trim tab , parts of a tail , the memory cards and already known plane data , investigators also will pore over " a tremendous ( amount of ) video that was captured " at the scene , according to @entity18			1
while a preliminary report will be available friday , @entity18 has said the full investigation could take six to nine months			2
" it 's not just what happened , it 's why it happened , " he said sunday			1
" ( we 're ) trying to make sure this does n't happen again			0
" meanwhile , the crash 's toll became clearer sunday as more of those killed were identified			1
besides @entity82 , the dead include @entity116 , a 22 - year - old from @entity118 who was attending the event with his father as part of a father - and - son vacation , his family said in a statement			0
his father , @entity125 , was " seriously injured , " the statement said			0
@entity116 was diagnosed at an early age with muscular dystrophy , and was wheelchair - bound his entire life			0
however , his 19 - year - old brother @entity129 said in the family statement , " he was about moving past that and always driven toward independence			0
@entity116 liked to get out and travel , and he was so excited about getting on a plane as part of this trip			2
" @entity137 graduated magna cum laude from @entity139 with a finance degree in may , his family said			0
he had operated a web development company and was in the process of developing a second business			0
memorial service details were pending , the statement said			0

the plane that crashed friday -- dubbed the " @entity165 " -- was one such plane dating from that era			1
several witnesses have portrayed @entity82 -- a real estate developer from @entity168 , @entity169 -- as a hero because he appeared to manuever the plane away from the crowded grandstands at the last moment			2
he went down around 4:15 p.m. pt friday while taking part in a qualifying round in the " unlimited class " division of the air race , said @entity179 , the show spokesman			2
