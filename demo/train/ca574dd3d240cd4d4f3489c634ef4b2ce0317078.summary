-- the blue @entity1 broke down amid the mountains of @entity3 in an area where there was no cell phone reception			2
the @entity7 in the car , on a cross-country journey for the holy month of @entity10 , approached a bushy - bearded fisherman			1
it would be another test of a question they wondered when they first set off from @entity17 three weeks earlier : is @entity18 still the accepting nation that embraced our forebears or has it reached a new level of intolerance ? far from the media frenzy dominating headlines , from the so - called " ground zero mosque " to a pastor 's planned @entity29 burning , @entity31 and @entity32 traveled more than 13,000 miles into the heart of @entity18 over the last month , visiting 30 mosques in 30 days for @entity10			1
they began in @entity17 , headed south and then cut across the country to @entity37 before making their way back , ending today in @entity40 in the nation 's largest @entity7 community			1
the fisherman in @entity3 became the embodiment of their trip -- @entity31 and @entity32 were embraced nearly everywhere they went , from a @entity49 souvenir shop in @entity50 to the streets of @entity52 , @entity53 , to the hills of @entity55 where the nation 's first mosque was built in 1929			1
like any road trip , there were strange moments along the way : a @entity63 police officer quizzed them about their beliefs on the ground zero mosque and they were asked to leave a mosque in @entity70 , @entity71			2
they chuckle about those experiences now and emphasize it should n't overshadow the whole trip because , ultimately , they discovered that @entity18 still embraces immigrants and the nation is filled with welcoming and loving people			1
ride along on the @entity10 road trip " after 13,000 miles , i think that @entity18 still exists , and i 'm happy to know that it does , " said @entity32 , a 23 - year - old @entity18 of @entity82 descent			1
" it 's really made @entity18 feel like home to me in a way that i 've never felt before			0
the @entity18 that we think about [ as immigrants ] is still actually there			0
i 've seen it ! and i 'm seeing it still			0
" when he approached the fisherman after their car broke down , @entity32 says , he did n't know how he 'd be received			1
he asked if he could hitch a ride to town and the fisherman " happily does it			0
" when the man asked @entity32 what he was doing in @entity3 , he told him about their 30 mosques journey			1
" and he does n't flinch and does n't get worried , " @entity32 said			1
" for me , it was like , ' wow ! that @entity18 still exists			0
' " he had a similar experience among @entity105 muslims in @entity106 , @entity107 , where it took 12 years for the community to build a mosque there " with their bare hands			0
" he saw one man cry on entering the mosque			0
an elderly couple hugged each other when they walked inside			0
" it means so much to these people who 've been displaced from their own country , and they come here to this place of worship , " he said			2
" that , to me , is really what this country is about			0
" for @entity31 , his favorite moment was @entity126 , @entity55 , a blip of a town with a population of 48 people			1
he knew little of the town 's rich @entity7 history , and it was difficult to try to find someone in the town who did			2
a pastor directed them to a woman , who kindly pointed them down a dirt road to where the nation 's first mosque once stood			2
it 's no longer there			0
it 's been replaced by a tiny cement block mosque , complete with a gold dome			0
nearby , there 's a cemetery marking the pioneering @entity152 , with birth dates of 1882 , 1904 , 1931			0
follow @entity0 's @entity154 @entity31 stood in awe			2
as he approached the mosque , his heart pounded			0
" i knew our roots went deep in this country , but it was great to truly experience it			0
praying in there was like hopping in a time machine , " said @entity31 , a 25 - year - old muslim who was born in @entity165 , @entity166			1
" i literally felt like i was plummeting and falling			0
" his takeaway from the trip , he says , was seeing how @entity7 in @entity18 have assimilated in their communities , from @entity172 , @entity173 , to @entity174 , @entity175 , to @entity176			2
" it was really cool and refreshing to see people who genuinely love the communities they 're in and they 're there to stay , " @entity31 said			1
" they 're involved in the community , not just the mosque			0
" it was also remarkable to have people , @entity7 and non-muslims alike , " just bend over backwards and be friendly to us , " he said			1
@entity32 said their blog also helps the rest of @entity18 realize " you have to accept @entity7 are here in @entity18 to stay , and we 've been here for awhile			1
even the most bigoted person has to accept that			0
" as for what 's next for the young men , they plan to celebrate @entity200 with their @entity7 brethren in @entity202 , @entity40 -- happy to have discovered an @entity18 that still embraces them , even if that 's not always portrayed in the news media			1
" it 's a small but vocal group of @entity18 in this country pushing this @entity208 rhetoric , " @entity31 said			2
" and unfortunately in our society , whomever shouts the loudest is going to get the most air time			1

two @entity7 travel 13,000 miles to 30 mosques in 30 states for @entity10
they discover a nation -- not of intolerance -- but one that embraces them
@entity31 says unfortunately people who shout the loudest " get the most air time "
@entity31 and @entity32 will celebrate @entity200 in @entity40
