@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 and the @entity3 ratified a political and economic agreement tuesday in a step leaders hailed as a " historic moment			1
" the @entity7 includes free - trade provisions , although they will not come into force until january 1 , 2016			0
former @entity1 president @entity11 's decision to drop the agreement last year in favor of closer ties with @entity15 triggered the popular unrest that led to his ouster , @entity19 's annexation of @entity1 's @entity21 region and months of fighting in eastern @entity1			1
@entity23 lawmakers backed ratification in a vote in @entity26 , @entity27 , while @entity1 's parliament voted at the same time in @entity29 to approve the deal			1

glory to @entity1 ! " addressing his parliament before the vote , he said the @entity1 people had " reversed the express train going @entity37 " toward @entity19 and thanked the @entity3 for its support			0

' special status ' @entity1 's parliament also voted tuesday in favor of legislation that would give " special status " to rebel - held parts of eastern @entity1 's @entity49 and @entity50 regions and grant amnesty to the separatists			1
a shaky ceasefire is in place between the @entity57 rebels and @entity1 forces who have been battling for control of the region			2
the " special status " legislation applies only to the area of the @entity49 and @entity50 regions currently under the control of the separatists , according to the @entity1 parliament 's official website			1
the granting of amnesty will apply only after the separatists have given up their weapons , handed over all those being held hostage and ended their occupation of public buildings , according to the legislation			2
this , in effect , means disarmament must take place before criminal cases are dropped			0
the amnesty will not apply to those suspected of carrying out the july shooting down of @entity85 17 over eastern @entity1			1
all 298 people on board the plane died			0
rebels reject disarmament however , @entity91 , the first deputy prime minister of the self - declared @entity92 , told @entity2 that the @entity1 government in @entity29 can forget about disarmament in exchange for amnesty			1
" it will never happen , " he said in a phone conversation			0
@entity99 said the @entity49 rebel leadership considered the special status legislation as no more than a basis for future negotiations with @entity29 , and felt under no obligation to accept its initiatives because it does not consider itself part of @entity1			1
" this was a decision of the @entity1 parliament , not of our parliament , " he said , adding , " this law will not stop the fighting			2
" @entity99 also said the legislation marked a step forward in one sense because it represented a partial acceptance by @entity29 of the existence of the @entity92 , whereas previously the rebels had been simply dismissed as terrorists			0
under the new legislation , a vote for local deputies will take place on december 7 , and a new " people 's police force " will be created in that area			0
also among the powers being granted are the right to use the @entity19 language rather than @entity1 in all areas of public life , including public institutions , courts and education			2
local authorities will take part in the appointment of prosecutors and judges , rather than the decision being solely in the hands of government in @entity29			0
there are many @entity19 speakers in eastern @entity1 , which historically has had close ties to @entity19			2
@entity148 envoy : road map to democracy @entity15 has made clear that it is opposed to @entity1 's pivot toward the @entity153			1
but @entity155 leaders -- who accuse @entity15 of sending troops and military equipment over the border into @entity1 to help the @entity57 rebels -- have welcomed the move			2
the @entity148 ambassador to @entity1 , @entity162 , said via @entity163 that the ratification of the @entity7 would provide a road map " for building a prosperous , @entity23 democracy , grounded in rule of law / anti-corruption			1
" the decision to delay implementation of the free trade part of the agreement for more than a year followed talks friday between representatives of the @entity3 , @entity1 and @entity19 , the @entity169 said			0
the @entity3 and @entity148 have imposed economic sanctions against @entity19 interests over @entity15 's intervention in @entity1			1

the speaker of @entity19 's lower house of parliament , @entity186 , opened a new autumn session tuesday in which he warned that " the updated version of the @entity190 is becoming a reality nowadays			0
" he was critical of @entity192 , which has voiced its clear support for @entity1 , although the country is not a member of the defense bloc			0
" by supplying @entity29 authorities with weapons , @entity192 countries would be meddling with @entity1 's internal affairs and aiding in war crimes , " he said			1
@entity19 defense minister @entity203 said tuesday the deployment of " a full - scale , self - sufficient " military force in @entity21 was a priority in light of current events in @entity1 , state news agency @entity202 reported			2
