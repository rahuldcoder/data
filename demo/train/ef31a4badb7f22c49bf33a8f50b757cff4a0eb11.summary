-- retired lt. gen. @entity1 was highly praised for his leadership of recovery efforts in @entity4 after @entity5 hit in 2005 , so he 's well - versed in what works and what does n't in disaster management			1
the general told @entity0 last week that the @entity11 military should have responded sooner to the earthquake in @entity13 because " time is of the essence " in helping quake survivors			1
@entity0 's @entity17 talked to gen. @entity1 wednesday about his assessment of the situation in @entity13 since he made those remarks			1
@entity0 : there are reports of looting in @entity13			1
is it looting , or an attempt at survival ? gen. @entity1 : in the first days after a disaster , people are generally scavenging for food			1
they are trying to find food where they can			0
people are going into survival mode			1
due to challenges and logistical issues , they use the food they have and what they can get their hands on			0
i would use the word " looting " lightly -- these people are surviving			1
it 's reminiscent of what was seen during @entity5 in the convention center			0
they survived because they found food in the surrounding areas			0
@entity0 : with the potential for violence running high , how can civilians protect themselves ? @entity1 : people should stay in their family groups and be with people they trust			1
during a disaster , in the case of not having enough communication , some of the information coming out is speculation and rumor			0
the role of the military is to provide a sense of order and try to keep people from becoming too excited when food and water are distributed			1
they also assure that help is on the way			0
what people are missing is information			1
you have someone sitting on a sidewalk with a baby , someone who is elderly , disabled , or pregnant , probably wondering what to do			0
their house is in rubble , they have members of their family who need to go to the hospital or special care			0
where can they go to be cared for ? or to help care for themselves in a humane manner ? this is a humanitarian matter of global proportions			0
@entity0 : previously , you 've mentioned " adapt and overcome			0
" how difficult is it to achieve this in @entity13 ? @entity1 : you need the @entity11 military			1
one airfield ? let 's build two more			1
@entity104 said , we have one airfield , how are we going to use it ? they do n't look at possibilities of building another one			1
building another airfield is something that should have been considered the first day			1
you can take a road and create another airfield			2
we have a capability to airdrop teams in with equipment to create airfields			0
@entity104 said airdrops are unsafe , and it 's disorderly to do airdrops			0
they were concerned that some would get food and others would n't			2
they started to drop five days after event -- the first drop of @entity126 ( meals ready to eat )			2
@entity0 : so why did the @entity11 wait before starting to drop supplies ? @entity1 : if you do n't have enough trucks , the optimal system is to use helicopters			1
but we do n't have enough on the ground to get the job done			2
@entity136 , @entity138 planes , we have not seen them in use			0
there are some in @entity142 , but not many there			0
they fly like a plane , land like a helicopter and can also carry a lot of cargo			0
they can lift things and set them down			0
we spent 20 years developing that aircraft			0
we do n't have enough helicopters -- between the @entity154 and the military , there are 60 helicopters in use now			2
four days after @entity5 , there were 200 helicopters flying in			0
i do n't know if the flow of supplies can keep up with demand , unless we evacuate the injured , elderly , pregnant women , babies , and the disabled			1
hospitals will be overflowing with people who have injuries , there will be infections that will need treatment			2
it is wishful thinking to add more hospitals			0
we need to think how these airplanes can leave with patients to the @entity11 and other countries to be distributed to hospitals to stabilize them			0
i am hoping that the @entity178 and the @entity179 will start pushing for a @entity181 resolution to start an evacuation plan for @entity13			1
it will need billions of dollars to sustain its people and to start its recovery			1
@entity0 : how did the @entity186 immediately set up a working hospital ? @entity1 : our military is fully deployed in @entity190 and @entity142			1
the president did n't sign mobilization of reserves until sunday			2
we are making right decisions , but making them too slowly to have an immediate impact on the ground			0
we decided [ tuesday ] to open another airfield , they should have done that days ago			2
@entity0 : you led the @entity200 for @entity5			0
can you draw some parallels between @entity5 and the earthquake in @entity13 ? @entity1 : in my book , " survival , " there 's a chapter that talks about dealing with the poor			1
i think sometimes we talk security , because as a culture , we are afraid of poor people in large groups			1
in @entity13 , right after the earthquake , there were doctors who left			1
one said , " we do n't have any security so we left			1
" that , in and of itself , is indicative of my @entity5 experience			0
and the slower we go , the more there 's the possibility of that happening			0
we have to work on establishing the community government officials in @entity13 so they can start communicating with their people			1
we have to get food and water there to local government officials to distribute it			0
the local government officials should be authorized to hire young men			0
the local economy will crank up if we pay people in @entity13 to do the cleanup and to run the distribution centers			1
there 's no need to send @entity11 there to distribute food and water when you have able - bodied people there who can do that			2
@entity0 : what are the top five points to keep in mind in the aftermath of natural disaster ? @entity1 : 1 ) improve communications			1
2 ) get food and water in			0
3 ) take care of the health and needs of people			2
4 ) evacuate people , particularly those who are pregnant , disabled , injured , babies , those who can not take care of themselves			2
5 ) establish who 's in charge			0
the president of @entity13 [ @entity263 ] is in charge			1
it 's different when the president and his government are victims			0
they are going to need help			0
someone needs to be the face of the operation to help the president keep people alive			2
you must have communication to establish a way of giving information to the people in their communities			2
you have to be your own first responder in a disaster like @entity13 , and the @entity13 people did that			1
these situations have a tendency to get worse before getting better unless you start evacuating vulnerable people			1
also , you have to take a risk [ about security ] during the search - and - rescue phase			2
in that phase of the operation , search - and - rescue takes priority over security .			2

gen. @entity1 says @entity13 should be paid to clean up , do distribution
says our culture is afraid of poor people in large groups so we focus on security
@entity1 says supplies ca n't meet demand ; @entity181 should start an evacuation plan for @entity13
general : they should have started to build second airfield the first day
