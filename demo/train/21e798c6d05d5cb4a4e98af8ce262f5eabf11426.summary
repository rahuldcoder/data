-- more than a month and a half into the search for @entity4 , the murmurs are growing louder			1
what if the @entity5 that disappeared over the southern @entity6 is never found ? it was a dismissible thought at first			1
after all , how could a jetliner carrying 239 passengers and crew simply disappear without a trace ? but so much time is passing with no debris , no oil slick and no bodies			1
it will go down as one of the world 's most enduring mysteries the disappearance of flight 370 would rank right up there with @entity25			1
this story has intrigued folks for generations			1
the swashbuckling aviatrix and pioneering woman embarked on the first around - the - world flight at the @entity32 in june 1937			1
after completing about two - thirds of the flight , she and navigator @entity34 disappeared			1
a search never found any trace of her , @entity40 or their plane			1
some believe they ran out of fuel and crashed into the sea -- similar to one theory of what happened to the @entity49 plane			1
then there 's the @entity51			1
many ships , planes and people have disappeared in this section of the @entity56 -- a " triangle " marked by the points of @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , @entity62			1
@entity64 officials cite hurricanes , sudden storms , the powerful @entity67 and shallow @entity69 waters as reasonable explanations for the lost vessels			1
but so far , there 's been no explanation for flight 370 's disappearance			1
of course , not all mysteries last forever			1
it took two years for search parties to recover the black box from @entity80 , which crashed into the @entity56 on june 1 , 2009 , en route to @entity82 from @entity83 with 228 people aboard			1
sometimes even when you know just about where something is , it 's hard to find			1
there was no gps and sea charts in 1912 when the @entity92 went down on its maiden voyage in the @entity56			1
it was n't until 1985 that the @entity96 luxury liner was found			1
seventy - three years is a long time to wait , but some answers take time			1
families never get the closure a tragedy deserves if you want to see agony , look into the faces of the relatives of the 153 @entity106 nationals who flew aboard the ill - fated flight			1
they 're guests of @entity49 in a @entity110 hotel while the search continues			2
they do n't expect miracles , but they do want information			2
" as time goes on we know that the odds of my son and the other relatives on the plane having survived becomes smaller and smaller , " a grey - haired man named @entity116 said recently , scarcely keeping his composure			2
a @entity125 diplomat listened intently			2
" to know that somebody is alive , you need to see them			2
to know that somebody is dead , you need to see the body			2
that 's all i ask of you , " @entity116 concluded , sobbing uncontrollably into a microphone			2
it 's been a roller coaster of emotions for the families			1
a dearth of information from @entity125 officials and repeated delays has provoked outright anger			2
" live up to commitments ! no more delays ! no more lies ! " fist - waving family members said			2
heartbreak compounded by disappointment will do that			2
grieving also gets tougher when there 's no body to bury			2
how do you let go if you ca n't say goodbye ? yet , hope still burns in the heart of @entity152 , whose wife was on the plane			2
" i can not let go of that idea , because still we have hope			2
and deeply i am really convinced in my heart ... that she will come back , " he said			2
" she has to come back , because so far we have not found any reason to lose that hope			1
false sightings will raise and dash hopes every few months or years , someone will come up with a new theory about how the plane disappeared -- or someone will spot what they think is debris			2
the fleeting moments of hope will give way to fresh anguish			2
@entity179 's parents know this all too well			0
the 3 - year - old vanished in june 2007 while on a family vacation in the @entity183 resort town of @entity184			0
her disappearance prompted headlines worldwide -- and remains a mystery 7 years later			0
there have been unconfirmed sightings of @entity190 ever since she was abducted			0
they bring with them varying degrees of promise			0
" in the beginning , it all consumes you			0
everything in your life takes second place , goes on the back burner , " @entity199 , the father of @entity199 , told @entity0 last year			0
the @entity206 teen went missing on a trip to @entity208 in 2005 , and her body 's never been found			1
the @entity213 case captivated the country , and even now from time to time , a new lead in the case will make headlines			0
" i feel for those families who are totally clueless , " @entity216 said			1
" at least we know who is responsible for our daughter 's disappearance			0
there will be big insurance payouts there 's no tally yet on just how much @entity49 will owe the relatives of the flight 's victims , but it 'll be a substantial figure			1
some attorneys , citing their past work on plane crashes , say the total for each passenger could vary from $ 400,000 to $ 10 million			0
the industry norm for insurance that airliners carry on their planes totals between $ 2 billion and $ 2.5 billion per aircraft , according to aviation attorney @entity244			1
that breaks down to about $ 10 million per passenger			0
there were 239 people on flight			0
the numbers can add up quickly			0
under an international treaty known as the @entity253 , the airline must pay relatives of each deceased passenger an initial sum of around $ 150,000 to $ 175,000 , but that 's just a starting point			0
relatives of victims can also sue for further damages			0
the plane 's manufacturer , @entity262 , could be another target of lawsuits			0
but until the jetliner is recovered , families wo n't have much of a case			1
it 's like trying to prove a murder without a body			0
there will be changes in policy every disaster brings changes in policy			0
but when you do n't even know the cause , where do you begin ? @entity64 regulators have already approved a new 90 - day standard for pingers attached to flight recorders , so search teams have a better chance of finding them under difficult circumstances			1
the two - year hunt to find @entity80 was the impetus , not @entity4			1
locator beacons that transmit for 90 days should greatly increase the odds of finding a lost jetliner even in deep water			0
@entity4 had 30 - day batteries in its beacons			1
they were about out of juice by the time aquatic listening devices picked up their signals for a short time			0
another 60 days would have helped their cause			0
by 2015 , the @entity304 will require all new planes to come with the 90 - day capability			0
all older planes must have it by 2020 , the @entity304 says			0
@entity125 has sent its preliminary report on flight 370 to the @entity310 , the @entity312 body for global aviation			0
but it has n't released it publicly			0
" it just adds fuel to the fire -- which is like a furnace now -- of disbelief , particularly in @entity106 , as to what is going on , " said @entity316 , managing director of @entity317			0
there are so many questions			0
are there better ways to track commercial aircraft ? can planes be followed better by using satellites to track their movements with transmitters that ca n't be shut down ? every phone has gps			0
ca n't we keep closer tabs on aircraft worth hundreds of millions of dollars ? the @entity312 aviation agency did tell @entity0 about a safety recommendation in the report : @entity125 said the aviation world needs to look at real - time tracking of commercial aircraft			0
it 's the same recommendation that was made after the @entity346 disaster			0
but " nothing seems to have happened , " @entity0 aviation correspondent @entity348			0
for now , though , the focus of determined search crews and anguished families remain on finding the @entity125 jetliner that disappeared without a trace			1
@entity0 's @entity354 and @entity355 contributed to this report			0

@entity25 and @entity51 are other lingering mysteries
it will be difficult for families to get closure if no bodies are found
billions in insurance claims will likely be paid out
*technology* and policies will change as a result of @entity4
