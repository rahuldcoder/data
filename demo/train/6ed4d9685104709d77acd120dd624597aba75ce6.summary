-- the holidays are over , and the slew of smartphone debuts at the @entity4 have come and gone			0
it 's now safe for retailers and carriers to start dropping prices on 2011 and early 2012 smartphone inventory , and that 's great news for those looking for a good deal			0
since @entity4 has ended , a number of smartphones are now available at very affordable prices			0
you 'd be safe , nay , smart to pick up one of these options if you 're looking to make the big switch from a feature phone to a smart device , or perhaps you recently bore witness to the death of your @entity25 in a wave of spilled beer			0
if you 're itching to try a @entity28 for the first time , you 're in luck			0
the @entity31 went on sale january 11 for a budget - friendly $ 50 , and is now available for only a penny from @entity34 , with the purchase of a @entity37 data plan ( which can be had for as cheap as $ 50 a month )			1
the 3.7 - inch , more spec - ed out @entity39 has n't had a @entity41 launch date announced yet , and the new 4.3 - inch @entity42 will land sometime " in the coming months , " representatives said			2
@entity43 dropped the price of its ultra-thin @entity45 from $ 300 to $ 200 , with contract from @entity47			1
the cheaper price tag dumps the @entity49 that previously came bundled with the phone , but if you still need that extra storage , you can pick up your own microsd for around $ 10			1
why the price cut on a phone that just launched in november ? in @entity43 's case , it 's time to make room for the new kid in town , the @entity60 , which will be available starting january 26			1
it 's essentially the same phone , only the @entity62 has way better battery life			0
the @entity64 , which launched this summer with a brilliant 4.5 - inch @entity66 screen , is on sale at @entity68 for a mere penny through january 24			1
and @entity71 's @entity70 is always just 99 cents ( with contract ) on @entity68			1
at @entity47 , the @entity73 and @entity25 are also on sale , priced at $ 0 and $ 100 , respectively			2
with the @entity76 rumored to arrive january 30 , it would n't be surprising if prices on 2011 @entity79 handset prices start dropping soon			2
if you 're in the market for a new smartphone , and none of these models tickle your fancy , keep your eyes open : there will definitely be more smartphone steals over the next few weeks as 2012 smartphone models start landing on store shelves			0
