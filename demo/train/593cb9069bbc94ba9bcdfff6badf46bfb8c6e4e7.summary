-- at work one day , it consultant @entity1 suddenly began to feel ill. a few hours later , he was in the emergency room , and doctors told him he might have a kidney infection			1
they just needed to run a scan to confirm the diagnosis			2
the next words were a cold reality check : the imaging machine could not support his weight			2
" they told me , ' we think you have a kidney infection , but we ca n't confirm for sure , so we 're just going to treat it aggressively and hope that 's what it is , ' " @entity1 said			1
he was 25 years old and weighed 592 pounds			2
two years earlier , @entity1 's wife , @entity21 , had had her own medical scare ; her gallbladder had to be removed because of weight - related complications			1
at her heaviest , @entity21 weighed 341 pounds			1
their size made everyday tasks difficult , too			2
years ago , @entity21 was on a plane , and the seat belt would n't buckle			1
she was mortified and tried to hide from the flight attendants that she did n't fit into the seat			0
both @entity21 and @entity1 had been asked not to get on rides at a theme park because of their size			1
but @entity1 's trip to the emergency room was the final straw			1
the @entity41 , @entity42 , couple realized something needed to change			0
luckily for @entity1 , doctors were right and able to treat his kidney infection without the scan			1
" it made me think , ' what if it was something else ? what if it was more serious ? what would i have done then ? ' " @entity1 said			1
so in february 2012 , the couple began a 19 - month journey to take control of their health			1
early struggles " i was always bigger than the other kids , but the pounds really started packing on during high school and continued to do so over the next several years , " @entity21 wrote on her blog , @entity59			1
for @entity1 , it was a knee injury at age 13 that kept him from playing sports			1
the exercise went away , bad eating habits continued , and his weight got out of control			0
the @entity69 met online seven years ago , and their relationship revolved around their eating habits			0
they would go out to eat and indulge in one unhealthy meal after another			0
they knew that in order to get healthy , they needed someone to steer them in the right direction			0
so they sought help from a weight - loss management program at a local medical school			0
a physician 's assistant gave them guidelines on what they should and should not be eating , and on the amount of exercise they needed			0
@entity1 and @entity21 started their new exercise routine by doing simple activities such as walking around the park and swimming			1
in late 2012 , they joined a gym			2
" we go to the gym five to six days a week and take one day off and try to do something fun and active like hiking or swimming , " @entity21 said			1
the couple also started using a smartphone app to track the calories they consumed			0
in the beginning , they ate at restaurants only on special occasions and prepared all meals at home			0
@entity21 found recipes for healthier versions of the foods they loved			1
their diet primarily consists of lean meats with lots of fruits and vegetables			0
even today , everything they eat goes into a food journal			0
the weight came off quickly at the beginning			0
@entity1 lost 25 pounds and @entity21 lost 30 pounds during the first month alone			1
they tried to keep the weight loss steady after that , knowing they could n't expect to see such a big number month after month without being disappointed			0
weekly weigh - ins helped them track their progress			0
" we have graphs that show our weight loss through an app. it helps us stay motivated and get through the hard weeks , " @entity1 said			1
in just 19 months , @entity1 dropped 362 pounds and @entity21 lost 176 , for a total of 538 pounds			1
' nobody is perfect ' as they begin to move into the maintenance phase of their diet , the couple has allowed themselves to indulge once in a while			0
they now have what they call their @entity152 , where they will cook something they do n't typically have during the week			2
" this sunday , we may have grilled turkey burgers on a whole - wheat bun with some oven - baked potatoes , " @entity21 said			1
" typically , we do not have starches very often and do not keep breads in the house			0
" they still give in to cravings from time to time			0
@entity21 says she has a sweet tooth , but she controls cravings by distracting herself with activities such as walks or naps			2
what keeps her on track is understanding that " no matter how many times you slipped or messed up , you just have to start over , and eventually you 'll get there , " she said			0
" you have to stay positive and remind yourself that you 're human and nobody is perfect			2
" even though they 've managed to lose a substantial amount of weight -- @entity21 went from a size 32 dress to a size 12 , and @entity1 went from size 58 pants to a size 36 -- the couple struggles with the psychological side effects of such a massive physical change			1
self - image has been an obstacle for both @entity21 and @entity1			1
they admit to having moments when they still see themselves as the obese people they used to be			0
" i do n't see myself as quite as small as what the pictures show or people tell us we look like , " @entity21 said			2
through both the struggles and triumphs they have found support in each other			1
they say that doing this as a team has brought them closer together , and they feel like they are almost newlyweds again			0
recently , @entity21 and @entity1 traveled on a plane and were thrilled to find they could not only buckle their seat belts but needed to tighten them			1
they also returned to the theme park and rode the rides with no problems at all			0
" it was kind of triumphant , " @entity1 said			2
" we are a lot more adventurous and outgoing			0
our outlook has changed almost completely			0
" have you lost weight ? share your story on @entity222			2

@entity21 and @entity1 lost a combined 538 pounds in 19 months
