@entity0 -- for four years , we 've witnessed a non-stop political brawl over @entity4			1
now rhetoric has again reached a fever pitch since the botched october 1 launch of the new insurance exchanges at the heart of president @entity11 's signature health care reforms			2
while @entity11 and @entity14 scramble to reassure supporters and a skeptical nation that the dysfunctional @entity4 website can be fixed and the reforms will work , @entity13 opponents seize every opportunity to attack the @entity20 they consider to be big government run amok			1
not surprisingly , such partisan back - and - forth has generated persistent myths about @entity4 that foment confusion , if not outright ignorance , about the reforms			1
in other cases , both sides try to quickly exploit newer issues			0
here is an attempt to debunk some of them : 1			0
if you like your plan , you can keep your plan let 's start with the obvious -- @entity11 's oft - repeated pledge in selling the reforms that they would n't require people to change health coverage or doctors			1
while the administration depends on a technicality to explain what @entity11 meant -- he was referring only to individually owned policies already in place back in march 2010 when the @entity4 became law -- it was misleading when he started saying it back in 2008 and definitely is false today			1
yes , anyone with an individual policy dating back more than three years can keep it , as long as it has n't been changed by the insurance company			1
however , that is unlikely in the volatile individual market that comprises about 5 % of @entity56 , a relatively small group compared to the 80 % who get coverage through their jobs or government programs such as @entity62 and @entity63			0
instead , at least 1 million individual policy holders have received letters from their insurers in recent months informing them that their plans are being discontinued at the end of the year or changed to cost more			0
the reason cited is added benefits required by @entity4			1
" the fact that the president sold it on a basis that was not true has undermined the foundation of his second term , " former @entity72 gov. @entity71 , who lost to @entity11 in last year 's presidential election , told @entity80 's " @entity79 " on sunday			2
@entity11 and his aides argue the president kept his word by including a " grandfather " provision that allowed people to keep their plans from before the health care law was passed , as long as the policies had n't been changed by the insurance companies			2
at the same time , they contend most policies no longer eligible for the " grandfather " provision -- and therefore being canceled by insurers -- offered substandard coverage , leaving people at risk of bankruptcy for hospitalization or other major medical needs			2
" if you have or had one of these plans before the @entity4 came into law and you really like that plan , what we said was you could keep it if it has n't changed since the law was passed , " @entity11 told supporters on monday night			1
" but if the insurance company changes it , then what we 're saying is they 've got to change it to a higher standard , " he said , adding that " if we had allowed these old plans to be downgraded or sold to new enrollees once the law had already passed , then we would have broken an even more important promise -- making sure that @entity56 gain access to health care that does n't leave them one illness away from financial ruin			1
" his explanation differed from the repeated promises on the campaign trail that if people liked their coverage , they could keep it , period			0
@entity11 aides note that for most @entity56 who get their health care through their jobs or government programs , that remains true			0
" what the president was referring to was the broader promise of the @entity4 , that if you 're on @entity62 or @entity63 , if you , like probably most people in this room , have insurance through your employer , if you 're a vet and you get coverage through the ( @entity149 administration ) , you do n't have to do anything , " @entity137 spokesman @entity136 told reporters on tuesday			1
@entity11 further alters ' you can keep your plan ' pledge 2			2
everyone 's health insurance costs will rise because of @entity4 republicans regularly declare that the end result of @entity4 will be higher health insurance costs for all			1
if that happened , it would continue what was going on before @entity4 , when skyrocketing health care costs put effective insurance coverage out of reach for millions of @entity56			1
@entity4 requires virtually everyone to have health insurance , which would create large markets of previously uninsured or underinsured people to stimulate competition and presumably hold down prices			1
that means some will pay more than before , such as healthier young people now required by the @entity4 to have coverage , and some will pay less			1
under the reforms , some people who make too much to be eligible for @entity63 coverage but not enough to afford high - quality plans can get government subsidies in the form of tax credits to ease the burden			2
@entity183 , an @entity4 architect from the @entity184 , told @entity185 that the reforms were based on the concept of shared responsibility			1
" we all share in the costs so that everyone can get it , " he said , adding that if people do n't have coverage and need health care , " they transfer those costs to the rest of us			2
that 's the whole point of part of @entity4 , to eliminate this cost shifting			1
" obamacare website getting better , official tells @entity205 panel 3			2
write me in recent weeks , as the extent of problems with the @entity4 website became known , the president and his aides sought to reassure the public by noting other options to enroll , including paper applications they could file by mail to avoid the dysfunctional online option			1
however , notes from so - called @entity220 meetings of administration officials released by the @entity13 - led @entity222 showed all applications still must be processed through the @entity225 website , regardless of whether they were submitted online or mailed in			2
" the same portal is used to determine eligibility no matter how the application is submitted , " said notes from an october 11 meeting , according to the committee			0
" ... the paper applications allow people to feel like they are moving forward in the process and provide another option ; at the end of the day , we are all stuck in the same queue			0
" website performance has improved , but problems continue as open enrollment for @entity4 enters the second of a planned six months			1
a notice at the top of @entity225 on monday explained it will be out of order between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. et every day as contractors work on it			0
@entity4 website goes dark for nightly fix - it work 4			1
the website is broken , so @entity4 is a failure " the website is just the tip of the iceberg , " @entity252 sen. @entity252 of @entity253 said monday			1
" there is the sticker shock for increased costs			0
there 's increased out - of - pocket cost in terms of deductibles and co-pays , and many @entity56 are not going to be able to keep their doctor , even if they 'd like to keep their doctor			0
" no one disputes that the website woes are a major problem that threatens to derail the vital enrollment of millions of uninsured or underinsured people if not fixed soon			2
however , the law was passed more than three years ago , and @entity11 aides point out it has already made a difference			0
in his speech monday night , @entity11 listed various reforms that already have taken effect			0
" the insurance market now has the strongest consumer protections that this country has ever known , " he said of the reforms			0
" no more discriminating against kids with pre-existing conditions			0
no more dropping your policy when you get sick			0
no more lifetime limits on the care that you can receive			0
all of that and more is part of a new patient 's @entity293 that 's smack dab in the middle of the @entity4 , and it 's helping people right now			1
" @entity299 , a @entity300 professor who helped design both @entity4 and the @entity72 health insurance program on which it was modeled , counseled patience in assessing whether reforms should be labeled a success or failure			1
" according to the @entity306 , it will be about a three - year ramp - up period until @entity4 is fully effective at its full level of functioning , " @entity299 told @entity1 last week			2
" that 's what we saw in @entity72 as well			0
so we need to just calm down and stop worrying about days and weeks and focus instead on months and years			0
" however , @entity299 warned that the @entity225 website must be fully operational by the end of november to ensure that people being forced to change policies have time to enroll by january 1 , when their current coverage ends			0
the @entity11 administration says the website will work smoothly for the " vast majority " of users by november 30			0
obamacare : it 's about government 's role , future elections @entity1 's @entity327 , @entity328 and @entity329 contributed to this report .			0

after more than three years of @entity4 , myths about the reforms persist
for some , you ca n't keep your plan even if you like it
not everyone will pay more because of @entity4
a broken website does n't mean all is lost -- yet
