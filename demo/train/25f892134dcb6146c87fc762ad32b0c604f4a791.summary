@entity0 -- the @entity3 government tuesday blocked the extradition of computer hacker @entity5 to the @entity7 to face trial for what the @entity7 government says is the biggest military computer hacking of all time			1
home secretary @entity13 said @entity5 was accused of serious crimes -- but that " there is also no doubt that he is seriously ill. " the extradition order against @entity5 should be withdrawn because his asperger syndrome and depressive illness meant " there is such a high risk of him ending his own life that a decision to extradite would be incompatible with his human rights , " she said			1
@entity5 has admitted to breaking into computers at @entity28 and the @entity29 but says he did so to find out if the @entity7 government was covering up the existence of @entity31			1
the 46 - year - old has fought a decade - long battle against extradition			0
the @entity3 director of public prosecutions will now look at whether @entity5 should face trial in a @entity3 court , may said			1
@entity5 's mother , @entity38 , who has campaigned for years on his behalf , told a news conference it had been " an emotional roller coaster " but that she was incredibly happy at the result			0
the decision to block extradition saved her son 's life , she said			0
he cried when he first heard the ruling but she had now seen him smile " for the first time in years			0
" @entity38 also praised may for " an incredibly brave decision -- to stand up to another nation as strong and powerful as @entity7 is rare			2
" @entity5 's lawyer , @entity51 , said it was " a great day for @entity3 justice " and that she hoped @entity3 prosecutors " might consider that @entity5 has suffered enough			1
" she also suggested he might be considered unfit to plead in a @entity3 court given his mental health issues			0
rights group @entity57 also welcomed what it said was a " long - overdue " decision involving a vulnerable man			0
" it 's a great day for compassion and common sense , " said @entity57 director @entity61			1
the @entity65 is examining the decision			2
" the @entity7 is disappointed by the decision to deny @entity5 's extradition to face long overdue justice in the @entity7 , " spokeswoman @entity67 told reporters tuesday			1
the @entity7 government says @entity5 accessed 97 computers from his home in @entity0 for a year starting in march 2001 , costing the government about $ 1 million			1
he is accused of breaking into military , @entity28 and civilian networks , and accessing computers at the @entity29 ; @entity78 , @entity79 ; @entity80 , @entity81 ; the @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity84 ; and the @entity85 in @entity86 , among others			1
in one case , @entity5 allegedly crashed computers belonging to the @entity90			0
but @entity5 's family and @entity51 had argued against the extradition on human rights grounds because he has asperger syndrome			2
people with the syndrome suffer difficulty in social relationships , communication and social imagination , according to @entity101 in @entity3			0
asperger syndrome may often include having special interests and becoming anxious if a routine is broken			0
psychiatrists who examined @entity5 said there was a risk of suicide if he was sent to the @entity7			1
@entity38 reiterated that point tuesday , saying her son told her he " felt like a dead person , " and that he would have preferred suicide to being taken thousands of miles away from his family and everything he knew			0
as well as @entity94 , @entity5 has other mental health issues , including lifelong schizophrenia , she added			0
@entity51 has also complained that the @entity7 has never provided evidence to prosecutors or @entity5 's legal team to support its extradition request			1
however , under @entity3 's @entity121 of 2003 , @entity7 prosecutors are not required to provide such evidence			1
critics have long argued that @entity3 's extradition treaties unfairly deny its citizens the chance to have the evidence against them considered by a @entity3 court before they are extradited			2
in response to such concerns , may outlined tuesday a series of proposals intended to make the extradition process both with the @entity7 and within the @entity134 , under the @entity135 , quicker and more transparent			2
the proposals include the introduction of a so - called " forum bar , " she said			0
" this will mean that where prosecution is possible in both the @entity3 and in another state , the @entity3 courts will be able to bar prosecution overseas , if they believe it is in the interests of justice to do so			2
" her remarks follow a two - year review of @entity3 's extradition arrangements			0
@entity61 pointed out that may 's decision to block @entity5 's extradition was only possible because of a provision in the @entity155 , controversial legislation which the @entity57 director described as " much maligned " in @entity3			1
@entity5 was on the brink of extradition in august 2008 , when the @entity160 in @entity161 , @entity162 , refused to reconsider the decision to send him to the @entity7 , effectively clearing the way for his transfer			1
he has been free on bail in @entity167 while the extradition process has been going on			0
a @entity7 federal grand jury indicted @entity5 on seven counts of computer fraud and related activity			2
if convicted , he would have faced a maximum of 10 years in prison on each count and a $ 250,000 fine .			0
