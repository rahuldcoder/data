-- once again , the news from @entity2 fills us with sadness and suggests that perhaps we should despair , that maybe it 's time to give up hope for the country			1
on thursday morning , an @entity2 guard allegedly opened fire at the gates of a hospital in @entity12 , killing three @entity13 , including @entity15 pediatrician @entity14 and a father and son , also doctors , visiting the medical facility			1
civilians have suffered the brunt of @entity2 's decades of turmoil , but when the killers target aid workers , people who have left their lives behind to come and help , their message is loud and painfully clear : " go away ! " in the anger , frustration and heartbreak that follow these attacks , i 've heard it many times , people declare : " that 's it			1
it 's time to leave			2
" in today 's incident , the guard opened fire on a group of five doctors as they walked from the gate to the building housing the hospital run by @entity45 , a @entity46 charity that says it came to @entity2 in 2005 at the invitation of the @entity2 government			1
@entity45 says it treats patients without regard to religion , gender or ability to pay			0
the hospital specializes in child and maternity care			2
@entity14 had worked in @entity2 since 2005			1
his colleagues say he loved the country			0
in addition to treating @entity2 patients , @entity14 helped train @entity2 physicians , a key requirement for building a country that eventually can become independent and self - sustaining			1
attacks against foreigners have been on the rise in @entity2			1
earlier this month , two journalists from @entity68 were shot			0
in january , a @entity75 suicide bomber blew himself up in a restaurant popular with foreigners , killing 21 people , most of them expatriates working for the local university , the @entity72 , and the @entity73 -- all trying to help @entity2 rebuild			1
last month , @entity75 gunmen burst into the restaurant in @entity12 's @entity81 , killing nine people , including women , children and several foreigners , some in the country as international observers for the april 5 presidential elections			1
what to do ? there is no more difficult decision for a humanitarian organization than pulling up stakes under fire			0
it 's a choice each group makes considering its own circumstances , just as individuals choose how much risk to take for a cause they believe worthwhile ; just as news executives anxiously decide how close to the line of fire to send their journalists			0
you could hear the pain in the voices of @entity107 ( @entity107 ) leaders last year , for example , when the group announced it was leaving @entity110 after 22 years as " a direct result of extreme attacks on our staff , " occurring while , the organization said , civilian leaders were tolerating and condoning the killing and kidnapping of aid workers			1
over the course of more than two decades , @entity107 staff had endured enormous risks			0
but , they said , " we have now reached our limit			0
" what makes these decisions particularly difficult is that they victimize the people who suffer the most and they reward the brutality of perpetrators , people who blow up schools , shoot doctors , and massacre civilians			1
the latest tragedy in @entity12 will undoubtedly prompt emergency meetings and anguished soul searching			2
organizations working in @entity2 will weigh the desperate needs of the @entity2 people against the dangerous reality for their workers			1
others will strengthen security , while conscious that the latest victims were killed by their supposed protectors			0
there is no shame in leaving or cutting back			0
but there is one thought all who have worked in @entity2 should keep in mind			2
there is one point that those who have been hurt there and the families of those who died in @entity2 should always remember : it has not been in vain			2
@entity2 is still a place where terrible things happen , and it is a country with a long and steep road ahead			1
but it is not what it once was			0
at the turn of the century , @entity2 was a ruin of a state , a maelstrom of suffering ruled by the @entity75 , who were succeeding in their effort to move their country to their pre-medieval ideal			1
the " government " held public executions , often by stoning , in the local stadium			0
@entity2 had become an international terrorist base , a place where modernity and freedom were banished			2
in 1998 , @entity184 described @entity12 as " a city of beggars , " where women who had been doctors and nurses and teachers moved through the streets " like ghosts " in their all - enveloping @entity192 selling everything they owned to feed their children			1
@entity184 declared the @entity75 's threat to women 's rights as " unparalleled in recent history			0
" today , the health minister who described the attack to @entity0 is a woman , as are other cabinet members			0
women can be found -- albeit in small numbers -- in most sectors of the country			0
and , incredibly , @entity2 surprised even itself with a successful presidential election on april 5			2
the results wo n't be known for a few weeks , a second round of voting will likely follow , but the verdict from the people is in with enormous force			0
despite threats from the @entity75 to punish anyone who participated , despite terrible or nonexistent roads and awful weather , @entity2 went to the polls by the millions			2
one member of @entity218 , @entity217 , told @entity0 , " as much as they killed our children , our journalists and innocent women , we say now , we will go and vote			0
... we want to see real change			0
" the next president , elected by the men and women of @entity2 , will face a mountain of overwhelmingly difficult challenges			1
and he will do it while @entity13 troops pull out			2
he , and the people of @entity2 , will continue to need help against individuals who are willing to shoot doctors to keep foreigners out , throw acid in girls ' faces to keep them from going to school , and massacre civilians in order to take power			1
there is no doubt that we will hear more sad news from @entity2			1
but we should remember that those who have sacrificed have done it for something important , worthy			0
they have alleviated suffering and helped bring the prospect of a lasting , better future for the people of @entity2			2
it 's no time to despair .			0

three @entity13 doctors killed by @entity2 guard at @entity12 hospital
@entity259 : our first *reaction* is to ask if it 's worth keeping aid workers in @entity2
she says aid organizations face *agonizing* decisions about withdrawing staff
@entity259 : there 's no doubt that @entity2 is a better country than at start of century
