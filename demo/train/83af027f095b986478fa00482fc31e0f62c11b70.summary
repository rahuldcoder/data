@entity0 , @entity1 -- the only question left for the jury considering the case of @entity7 maj. @entity6 is whether he will live or die for targeting @entity10 - bound soldiers in one of the largest mass killings of military personnel on a post on @entity16 soil			1
jurors deliberated less than seven hours over two days before finding @entity6 guilty friday on 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of all charges in connection with the november 5 , 2009 , shootings at a deployment process center			1
the @entity7 psychiatrist admitted to targeting soldiers , saying previously he wanted to protect the @entity27 and its leaders from the @entity16 military			2
the court - martial moves on monday to the penalty phase , where @entity6 -- acting as his own attorney as he did during the trial -- will have the opportunity to address the jurors considering whether he should be executed for his actions			1
the big question is whether @entity6 will take the stand in the penalty phase after declining to testify himself , cross-examine witnesses or give a closing statement			1
the @entity16 - born @entity43 has indicated in documents leaked to the media that the death penalty would allow him to become a " martyr			1
" for a family member of at least one of @entity6 's victims , the death penalty " would be too lenient			1
" @entity0 victims feel betrayed " i would much rather see him sit in prison for the rest of his life			2
he should n't be allowed to dictate what happens			2
he wants to motivate other terrorists , " @entity59 told @entity2 by telephone			2
" ... we need to stop him from being martyr " to terrorists			2
@entity59 's wife , former army pvt. @entity66 dragged a wounded soldier out of the deployment processing center as @entity6 targeted people in uniform with his laser - mounted weapon			1
he shot her in the back			2
today , the outer wounds have healed			0
it 's the unseen ones -- the emotional scars of that day -- that have n't , @entity59 said			0
' remember the day ' at this sprawling 350 - square mile @entity7 post in central @entity1 , the case has routinely dominated the headlines of the local newspaper and television stations			0
for many here , there was life before the rampage , one where there was the reality that loved ones could die or be wounded while fighting in @entity10 and @entity90			0
then there was life after -- after loved ones were gunned down by a fellow soldier			0
" you do n't hear people talking about it all the time , but you think about it , " said @entity95 , who said works on the @entity7 post in a civilian capacity			0
" i remember the day it happened , and it was shocking			0
here the guys go to war and come back , and they get killed here			0
it is n't supposed to happen that way			0
" but it did , for those who survived and the families of those who did not			0
soldier on soldier attacks in @entity116 , @entity117 , tears rolled down @entity119 's face when she learned that @entity6 was found guilty of shooting her husband , staff sgt. @entity120 , six times			1
" i 've been crying all day , like most of the victims have , but it 's a sense of relief			0
this is just the start for the victims because we have sentencing , " she told @entity2 by telephone			0
@entity120 's husband was one of the nearly 90 witnesses who testified for the prosecution during 12 days of testimony , delivering a horrifying account of the massacre as @entity6 stared at him			1
@entity120 , 37 , was in the deployment processing center , texting his wife as he awaited his turn , when someone in front of him shouted " @entity143 " -- @entity144 for " @entity145 is the greatest " -- and began firing			0
he described his bullet wounds , including one that pierced part of a lung			0
" i figured the shooter would finish me off , " @entity120 said			0
the two -- @entity6 and @entity120 -- locked eyes as the staff sergeant identified the major as the man who shot him			1
@entity120 's wife , who watched the testimony from the gallery , said there was a relief when it was over			0
much had been made about whether @entity6 , who was acting as his own attorney , would cross-examine the witnesses , including her husband			1
" i was pretty angry			0
i was anxious all week not knowing if he was going to cross-examine my husband or not , and not sure how my husband will deal with that , " she said			2
" i noticed he was making eye contact with my husband , and that just infuriated me			2
" inside the courtroom , shortly before the verdict was delivered , the judge cautioned the spectators in the gallery against outbursts			0
@entity6 stroked his beard as the jury -- a military panel of 13 senior officers -- filed into the courtroom			1
he then looked at the head of the jury -- a colonel -- who affirmed a verdict had been reached			2
@entity6 showed no emotion as the verdict was read , a contrast to a handful of some of family members who cried or gave one another brief hugs			1
' a first , small step down the path of justice ' " today 's guilty verdict , rendered almost four years after the attack , is only a first , small step down the path of justice for the victims , " said attorney @entity197 , who represents victims and families of those killed in a compensation claim against the government for failing to stop the attack			0
almost immediately after the attacks , there were widespread questions about how @entity6 was evaluated , promoted and transferred to @entity0 with plans to deploy to @entity10 despite questions about his actions , including giving an academic presentation on the value of suicide bombings			1
@entity197 renewed the call for the government to reclassify the shootings as a " terror attack " rather than workplace violence			0
" justice for the victims of @entity0 will be done only when the government admits its mistakes , keeps its promises to ' make the victims whole ' and comes clean about @entity0 , " @entity197 said			0
" the victims , and the @entity16 people , are owed nothing less			0
" as has been done nearly every day in the three - week court - martial , the judge asked @entity6 if he had reconsidered defending himself as the case enters the penalty phase			1
jurors " will decide whether you live or die , " the judge , col. @entity238 , told @entity6 after reconvening the court monday afternoon as part of the penalty phase preparation			1
" ... i think it is unwise for you to represent yourself			0
" @entity6 told the judge he intended to continue representing himself in the case			1
' @entity244 duty to kill ' on thursday afternoon , the judge handed the case to the jury after @entity6 declined to make a statement during closing arguments that followed 12 days of testimony			1
the prosecution urged the jury to convict , saying the evidence showed that @entity6 believed he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible			1
for more than 90 minutes , the prosecutor took the jury methodically through the evidence in the case , meticulously piecing together how he said @entity6 prepared and planned for the attack			1
prosecutors have maintained that the @entity16 - born @entity43 underwent a progressive radicalization that led to the massacre at the sprawling central @entity1 base			0
" he did not want to deploy , and he came to believe he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible , " col. @entity263 told the jury			2
@entity6 picked the day -- november 5 , 2009 -- because it was when the units he was scheduled to deploy with to @entity10 were scheduled to go through the processing center , he said			1
@entity6 rested his case without calling a single witness or taking the stand to testify on his own behalf			1
his decision not to offer a defense was an anticlimactic end to the trial in which prosecution witnesses , primarily survivors , painted a horrific picture of what unfolded inside a processing center during the attack			0
during closing arguments , prosecutors showed a graphic @entity285 video of the crime scene hours after the rampage , where bodies , blood and bullets still covered the floor			0
as the video was shown to the jury , some of the family members of those killed fought back tears			2
one woman laid her head on her husband 's shoulder , tears streaming down her cheeks , while another woman , a wife of a victim , left the courtroom			1
for his part , @entity6 watched the video , appearing to pay close attention @entity6 's defense much has been made of @entity6 's defense or , as his stand - by attorneys have said , the lack of it			1
the judge , @entity238 , declined a request by @entity6 's attorneys to drop out of the case			1
the attorneys argued that @entity6 was helping the prosecution put him to death			1
there may be something to that claim			0
@entity6 took credit for the shooting rampage at the outset of the trial , telling the jury during opening statements that the evidence will show " i was the shooter			1
" @entity238 barred @entity6 from pleading guilty at the start of the court - martial			1
under military law , defendants can not enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases			0
the judge refused to allow @entity6 to argue " defense of others , " based on his claim that he carried out the shootings to protect the @entity10 @entity27 and its leaders from @entity16 soldiers			1
perhaps as a way around that ruling , @entity6 in recent days has leaked documents through his civilian attorney to the @entity346 and @entity347 that offer a glimpse of his justification for carrying out the attack			2
among the documents was a mental health evaluation conducted by a military panel to determine whether @entity6 was fit to stand trial			2
" i 'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life			0
however , if i died by lethal injection , i would still be a martyr , " he told the panel , according to pages of the report published by @entity346			2
the judge excluded much of the evidence that the prosecution contends goes to the heart of the motive for the attack , including e-mail communications between @entity6 and @entity368 , the @entity16 - born cleric who officials say became a key member of @entity371			2
he was killed in a @entity16 drone strike in 2011 .			0

the jury that convicted @entity6 in the @entity375 will decide his fate
the penalty phase begins on monday
death penalty " would be too lenient , " says the husband of one victim
@entity6 has indicated the death penalty would allow him to become a " martyr "
