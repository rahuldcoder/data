@entity40 : according to @entity146 that 's only the sixth safety in @entity43 history and the first since @entity150 23.41 gmt : @entity14 2 - 0 @entity16 first points of the night and from an unlikely source as @entity16 qb @entity11 throws an incomplete pass from his own endzone and the referee rules a safety ! in soccer terms that 's the equivalent of an own goal and not the best of starts for @entity11 and his teammates			1

can the famous combination of quarterback @entity11 and coach @entity180 work their magic again to claim a fifth @entity182 for the @entity16 ? or will the @entity14 rain on their parade as they did the last time the two sides met in the @entity43 in 2008 ? @entity186 will guide you through the drama of the next few hours at the @entity189 in @entity5 , providing latest score updates and commentary , on the decisive moments of the super-charged finale to the @entity146 season			1
