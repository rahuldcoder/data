-- growing up , i wanted to be @entity2 , the @entity4 defensive end for the @entity5			1
the way i saw it , i already had the last name			0
and i was oversized , much taller than the other girls -- and the boys for that matter			0
so in my mind i was too tall			0
no one could tell me different			0
it made me feel special to walk around the neighborhood with that nickname			0
so i was , too -- and not just the gangly girl some people saw trying to find her way			0
my scruffy friends and i would play tackle football for hours in a dusty patch behind my building			1
and i would charge the field , screaming with unbridled joy , crushing anything in my path			0
getting injured ? nobody worried about such nonsense			0
but those days are long gone			0
today , though few things bring me greater joy than football , i am at a crossroads			1
it 's obvious we need new rules to save the game and protect players			1
no one can ignore the mounting medical evidence that brain damage sustained in football , as well as other contact sports , is linked to serious health problems , including depression , dementia , suicide and death from respiratory problems			1
the discussion has even reached the @entity54			0
last week , president @entity55 weighed in , urging the @entity56 to address the serious health hazards in the college game			1
this week , the @entity60 players union announced it has given @entity61 a $ 100 million contract to conduct a 10 - year study on concussions and other health issues associated with the game			1
for me , it is not only a question of whether the multimillionaire @entity60 pros are being protected			0
you do n't have to be a sports insider to understand that the tragic death of @entity73 and the serious health problems of many retired @entity60 players demand changes in the way football is played			1
there really is no choice			0
but football is also putting our kids in danger			2
research , such as a study done by @entity87 , has identified serious brain damage , or @entity89 -- chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- not only in the autopsied brains of professional football players but in at least one high school player 's brain as well			1
more than ever before , parents are terrified of putting their boys on the field and , understandably , refuse to let their kids play football			1
even @entity55 , a big football fan , told @entity101 that if he had a son , he would " have to think long and hard " about whether he would let him play , because of the potential of getting injured			1
and those parents who allow their kids to play football want safer rules and better oversight			1
" my son was kickoff returner			0
i could n't even watch			2
" said @entity109 , whose oldest boy was a star player at @entity111 , a public school outside of @entity112 , @entity113			0
" you are watching 11 huge boys fly downfield and their goal is to kill your child , just to knock a ball loose			0
it 's the scariest part of the game			1
if anything could be done on the kickoff where the momentum ( would be ) slowed down , i would be all for that , " she said			0
" maybe we could do away with the kickoff completely			0
" @entity109 is a football mom			2
she understands well that even a small rule change , such as eliminating the kickoff , might cause a nationwide revolt			2
but she also knows her job is to keep her boys safe			0
when her 10th - grader , a lineman at @entity136 , was recently sidelined for more than two weeks with a concussion after a dirty hit in practice , his mother did n't panic			2
she is confident that the school is following the stringent injury policy mandated by the state of @entity113			0
it is a well - funded school district where most of the parents are college - educated , @entity109 said			2
the football team has a trainer and team doctor , who regularly communicate with parents			1
other players and families might not be as fortunate			0
" it 's very different in @entity152 , @entity113 , schools , where parents and coaches are less educated and more concerned about winning than safety for the children , " @entity109 said			1
" i hate to say it , but economics make a big difference			2
they do n't do things the right way in those schools			2
" ex-nfl stars after concussions : lives unraveled football 's a dirty , dangerous game			1
it 's never been for the fainthearted , and that 's part of the appeal			2
but in order to save the game , and stop parents from steering their kids away from the gridiron , new rules are necessary			1
the game will have to be safer to attract future generations			1
@entity183 might have to come first from the ranks , where parents ' impact is still greater than that of big - money tv deals and wealthy alumni boosters			2
change may come from schools like @entity111 , or even from the @entity193 organization , the nation 's oldest youth football and cheerleading program , where an estimated 250,000 kids play football across the country			1
@entity193 's executive director , @entity200 , is taking safety more seriously these days , thinking of new rules and creative ways to better train volunteer coaches			1
his organization created a medical advisory board of neurologists and neurosurgeons to examine how to avoid and detect concussions			0
it has decided to immediately take any child with a head or neck injury out of the game , and to require a doctor 's note to allow that child to play again			1
the group has set limits on how long each player can stay in a game and how much contact is allowed during practices			1
coaches can not spend more than a third of practice time in full speed contact			2
and no full - speed drills can start more than three yards apart			0
@entity200 envisions a time when brain scans will be mandatory each season for all children who want to play football			1
he wants to use this technology to identify kids who are most susceptible to brain injuries			1
and those players , he said , would be directed to other sports with less contact and fewer collisions			0
good luck selling those ideas to the @entity56 or the @entity60 and its player unions -- or even some parents			2
but i think @entity245 is headed in the right direction			0
he 's putting player safety first			2
call me silly , but i think a kid should be able to dream about becoming an @entity60 star playing in the @entity251 -- a safe @entity251			0
who knows ? she might just become a superstar on her own field on the way to the @entity256			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity259 .			1

@entity259 has always loved football , but says it 's time to recognize its risks
evidence mounting that playing football can result in dangerous brain injuries
@entity2 : the game needs rules to make it safer or more parents wo n't let sons play
change will be very difficult , she says , but it 's time to set up better *safeguards*
