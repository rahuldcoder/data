he had magazines from the period , letters from soldiers back to their family and a lot of photography			0
" @entity97 said most re-enactors see what they do as a hobby			0
a small percentage , however , take the practice too seriously , even hoarding both antique and modern weapons			0
there is a sense of empowerment they feel re-enacting battles , he said			0

" and i think that 's what we are seeing here with @entity4			1
" @entity97 's wife , @entity135 , who also worked on the film , said of @entity4 : " he was very specific , very precise about what he did			1
and he actually preferred to do what they call tactical re-enactments , which are re-enactments that are private and that are performed in the woods where they actually go out and hunt the , you know , in this case , @entity144 ... he might have just snapped and took the fantasy a little bit , well , way more seriously			2
