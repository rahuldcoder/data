consumers left angry and confused after the botched @entity2 rollout now have something else to worry about : misleading letters from insurance companies			1
in @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 , state insurance commissioners have come down on insurance companies for sending thousands of consumers letters that were either threatening , incorrect or omitted crucial information about the @entity2			1
the biggest offender : @entity14 , a @entity15 insurance company			1
@entity8 insurance commissioner @entity16 fined the @entity18 - based company more than $ 65,000 after it sent more than 6,500 customers a letter @entity21 found " misleading			1
" the august letter said that customers had to choose one of two options within 30 days : either legally extend their current policy through next year or choose a new , more expensive policy that complies with @entity2			0
the letter never mentioned buying insurance through the new exchange			2
and the 30 - day window expired before the new state insurance exchange opened october 1 , meaning that customers had to decide whether to take @entity14 's coverage before seeing what options would be available on the exchange			1
@entity2 fix could add millions in government costs a 63 - year - old retired man in @entity8 who received the letter said he felt like @entity14 had put a gun to his head			1
he either had to renew his current coverage through the end of 2014 for about $ 280 a month or see his monthly premium more than double , to about $ 620			0
" what they were telling me was i had to accept their choice to continue with no protection from preexisting conditions , to basically take their choices and go ahead before i knew the other options that were available through the exchange , " said the man , who asked for anonymity to share personal information and speak candidly about a politically charged issue			2
@entity21 called the letter " high pressure			0
when you 're told you got ta do something in 30 days and if you do n't do it we 're going to make the choice for you , that 's disconcerting			0
" but the letter was more than troubling , it was also illegal			0
@entity21 said @entity14 broke the law when it included a form with the letter that had not gotten the required approval from her office			0
she said @entity14 officials worded the letter the way they did because " they were interested in keeping those policyholders			1
also , i think , again , it was a lack of understanding of @entity8 law			0
" in addition to the fine , @entity21 required @entity14 to send customers a correction with a full range of options that included buying insurance from the exchange , working with a broker or even keeping their current coverage until it expires			1
@entity21 said she fined the company a relatively low $ 10 per letter -- she could have gone as high as $ 1,000 per letter -- because she was trying to send a message			0
" while that does n't really seem like a very significant amount of money , that action the department took goes into a national database and it informs all the other states of a fine and an order that @entity8 took against @entity14 , " she said			1
" so that alerts all the other states that their could be some problems			0
" more questions swirl around @entity108 and she worried that if she levied a bigger fine , @entity14 would just pass the cost along to their customers in the form of higher premiums			0
in @entity7 , @entity14 sent a similar letter that received an rebuke from state insurance commissioner @entity118			1
that letter told 3,400 @entity14 policyholders in @entity7 that they had to make a decision within 30 days or risk losing their coverage			1
and just like in @entity8 , the 30 - day window ended before the state exchange opened			2
" i was disappointed to see a letter that appeared threatening and incorrect going out to consumers			0
the last thing we need is more confusion , " @entity118 said of the letter			0
her office required @entity14 to retract and resend the letter and to apologize to its policyholders			2
and in @entity136 , the state insurance department is looking into whether similar @entity14 letters there broke any laws			1
" the department is aware of written correspondence between @entity14 and policyholders and is looking into the matter , " said @entity140 , the department spokesman			2
@entity14 declined multiple interview requests , but in a statement said , " @entity14 has been reaching out to our individual insurance policyholders to let them know of their full range of coverage options beginning january 1 , 2014 ( when the @entity2 's new insurance laws become effective )			1
" obamacare : now what ? but @entity14 is not the only company to come under fire			0
in @entity9 , @entity156 drew the ire of regulators when it sent out a letter that made no mention of the state 's healthcare exchange			2
in response to the misleading letter , the @entity9 insurance commissioner sent out a consumer alert to make sure people knew their options , said department spokeswoman @entity169			1
@entity156 spokesman @entity170 said the complexity of health insurance reform means that they are unable to communicate all the details in a single letter			2
" the first goal is , you 're a customer of ours , here 's what your options are with us , as one would expect , " he said			0
" our experience is our consumers are well aware there are other options for their business			0
