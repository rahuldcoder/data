-- the woman was related to at least two of the three children			1
was she their doting mother ? an adoring aunt ? or , given her relative youth , perhaps a much older sister ? " that leaves you with so many possibilities , " says @entity8 state police sgt. @entity7			1
all four females are long dead , their bodies crammed into two 55 - gallon barrels , the first barrel discovered by a hunter in 1985 , the other 15 years later			1
they have never been identified			2
now , there 's a new push to solve a cold case that has stymied determined investigators			2
this week , the @entity20 , after a request from state police , released new @entity24 facial reconstructions of the four victims			1
they provide more details than previous images			2
investigators hope that someone , by looking at gaps in their teeth , thickness of lips , the length of their hair or other features , will make a connection			2
" the right person is going to see it , " says @entity39 , director of the center 's unknown victim identification team			1
seemingly endless questions and possible scenarios swirl around investigators who have sifted through hundreds of tips or leads over the years			2
is this a domestic case , or a professional hit ? how did the barrels come to be on a wooded lot near a state park in @entity53 , @entity8 ? were the four transients ? could they have lived on a commune ? did they live in other state or country ? police have no missing persons report associated with the mysterious case			1
@entity7 , in an interview with @entity0 on friday , said he has been open to theories and new evidence since he joined the case a few years ago			2
he 's certain of one thing			2
" i believe that there is somebody who knows who these children are and knows what happened to them			2
" two horrifying discoveries during deer season in 1985 , a hunter made a grisly discovery on a parcel of private property near @entity78 , known for its bogs , lakes and trails			2
a steel drum contained the remains of the woman , estimated to be between ages 23 and 33 , and the eldest girl , who was between 5 and 11			1
original reports indicated they died of blunt - force trauma			2
investigators later determined they were related in some way			2
state police , who handle nearly all homicide investigations in @entity8 , notified the @entity94 ( @entity94 ) , a computerized index that includes such reports			1
it was believed then that the victims might be a mother and child			1
" they came to every person 's door and asked , ' have you heard anything , if you knew anyone that 's missing ? ' " @entity53 resident @entity107 told told @entity0 @entity8 affiliate @entity108 this week			1
' " no , we have n't heard anything			2
' " within one day of the discovery of the bodies , state police were called in to investigate an apparently unrelated slaying of a man in nearby @entity116			1
suddenly , that murder became the priority of the police force			1
" it took a great number of resources , " @entity7 says of the @entity121 investigation			2
that murder was finally solved eight years ago			2
@entity8 , with a population of about 1			1
3 million , sees an average of only 20 to 30 homicides a year , according to @entity7			2
about half are domestic incidents			2
policy called for troopers to look into a cold case if they were not working on a current homicide			2
so , in 2000 , an investigator drove to the @entity53 scene to check on the proximity of barrels on the property to a road and a mobile home park close by			1
the property included a trailer and the remains of a burned camp store			2
in another barrel , the trooper found two more bodies -- a girl between 1 and 3 and another aged 2 to 4			1
tests indicated the woman whose body was found earlier was related to the younger child			1
so far , the girl between 2 and 4 has not been linked to the woman			1
instead of a mother and child , police broadcast that they had four victims , meaning old assumptions were gone			1
" so much can change in that span " of time , @entity7 says of evidence and investigative leads			2
police spoke to between 50 and 100 individuals , including the property owner and residents of the mobile home park			1
now the case is getting a fresher look			0
" we are reanalyzing each and every person , " says @entity7			0
the department , when the @entity94 broadcasts went out in 1985 and 2000 , was flooded with information			0
" we took great pains to rule people out			0
" the sergeant acknowledges that many may question why it took 15 years to find a second barrel 100 yards from the other			0
" how do four people go missing and nobody knows it " ? the sergeant cites resources needed for the @entity121 murder , the number of people in the major crime unit and the fact that autumn leaves covered much of the property			0
" they did the best with what they had at the time , " he says			0
@entity203 school deaths remain mystery " i keep an open mind to everything " @entity39 , of the @entity20 , tells @entity0 that she and her team are awaiting results of more comprehensive dna testing of the remains of the woman and young girls			1
they are being aided by additional autopsy photos not available years ago			0
evidence indicates the victims were white , but investigators do not know skin tone or eye color			1
the bones were not in the best condition , given they were exposed to the elements and years of deterioration , says @entity39			0
they may have died as early as 1977 or 1978			0
@entity224 , a forensic imaging specialist with the center , used newer technology to make the facial reconstructions			1
the use of clay directly applied on skulls is no longer necessary			0
investigators caution people looking at the reconstructions to focus on specific facial features			1
" do n't expect this to look like a @entity237 of the family member , " says @entity7			0
based on evidence and poor dental care , officials believe the four may not have been visible members of society			0
" if they interacted with people on regular basis and suddenly disappeared you would expect somebody to say something , " says @entity39 , a forensic scientist			0
and they may not have been in a traditional family setting			0
" i do n't think they were regularly in school and went home and had dinner with mom and dad every night , " says @entity39			0
@entity7 says , although it is a possibility , his hunch is the victims are not from @entity8			1
they could be from @entity262 , about 90 minutes away			0
or more remote portions of the @entity8			1
" i keep an open mind to everything , " @entity7 says			0
police are not certain whether the victims were killed elsewhere and dumped on the property -- or even when			1
" it takes a very certain profile of an individual to kill a child , " says @entity7 , who declined to elaborate on consultation with the @entity272 's behavioral analysis unit			0
" we either have n't reached the family members we need to , or we missing their family members and for their own reasons they are not coming forward			0
" one day , grave marker may bear names @entity283 and her brother , maintain a blog about the @entity53 case and have provided some information they 've gleaned to police			1
" this case is so compelling , " says @entity290 , who grew up in southern @entity8 and now lives in @entity291			1
" this story has been very quiet			0
" the siblings , who on their website say they do not represent a law enforcement agency , have talked with hundreds of people			0
@entity7 says the pair have been in contact with state police			1
@entity290 praises police for their doggedness and said she believes the case will be solved			1
she believes she and her brother are in a sense a proxy family for the victims			1
a grave marker at a church cemetery in @entity53 -- a town of about 4,400 east of @entity312 -- refers only to the first two victims found			1
" may their souls find peace in @entity319 's loving care , " the inscription reads			0
one day , @entity290 says , she would like the grave marker bear names of the four victims			1
" i want to see it resolved			0
" social media might have made a difference the woman and the girls were killed before there was text messaging , @entity330 and other forms of social media -- a fact not lost on investigators			1
and , back in 1985 , police did not have a clearinghouse for missing people			1
the @entity20 had been in existence for only one year			0
social media is a valuable tool for investigators , says the center 's @entity39 , who leads a five - member team			1
" from the missing side it has helped in a lot of cases , " she says			0
" you can see who perhaps who they were talking to			0
with teenagers , their friends know more than their families know			0
" unlike in 1978 or 1985 , people nowadays are extremely connected , be it through cell phones , e-mail or social media			0
" if you do n't get a text within two hours you might wonder what is going on , " says @entity39			0
still , she cautions , there are still cases today when people " are not reported missing for various reasons			0
" @entity7 says someone critical to identifying the four victims may not have come forward because of a sense of criminal liability or guilt for not having provided clues sooner			1
the victims , he says , may have been part of a disjointed family			1
he hopes the dna testing may clearly show the relationships among the four victims , providing police and the public more opportunities to identify them			1
" it 's an awful tragedy to lose a person to a homicide			0
it is terrible miscarriage of justice not to know who carried out the crime against your loved one			0
" @entity39 and her team are working on 650 cases involving unidentified children			0
the oldest case is from @entity395 , in 1933			0
since november 2011 , the team has helped identify seven children , one of whom was a victim of @entity400 , the so - called @entity401 , she says			2
@entity402 helped solve the cases			0
now @entity39 hopes to give a family a sense of closure			0
" a good day is giving a child their name back , " she says			0
" and we get very excited			0
