-- an @entity2 woman walked away from a car crash that killed her husband , authorities believe , but they have found no trace of her other than footprints in the snow leading to a road			1
a search was in its third day tuesday for @entity11 , 40 , of @entity12 , @entity2 , according to the @entity13 , @entity2 , @entity14			1
ground operations began at 9 a.m. with air operations starting at noon , sheriff @entity15 said			2
" they 're looking , " he told @entity0 sister network @entity18			2
" they 're expanding their search area just a little			1
" @entity11 was last seen along with her husband @entity23 , 41 , at a @entity25 party saturday night in @entity26 , about 17 miles west of @entity12 , relatives told @entity0 affiliate @entity27 and the @entity28			1
" they were dancing together , really cutting up a rug , " @entity23 's sister @entity29 , who was at the party , told the @entity28			2
she said the couple -- married 20 years with four daughters ages 4 to 15 -- left the party arm in arm			2
her brother was sober , she told the newspaper , and was driving his wife 's car			1
about 1:45 a.m. sunday , a deputy on patrol in a rural area of @entity44 found a one - car traffic accident , the sheriff 's office said in a statement			1
" the deputy found a male occupant of the vehicle in the driver 's seat deceased , " the statement said			1
" evidence at the scene indicated that a second person was also in the vehicle at the time of the accident			2
further investigation revealed that the second person was possibly the wife of the deceased driver			2
" the car slid backwards into a pole , @entity15 said , with enough force to break the backs of both the front seats			1
a relative told the @entity66 's back was broken			2
footprints were reportedly found leading from the car to a nearby road			1
but there , @entity11 's trail ends			1
" there 's nothing for us to believe there 's any issues other than exactly what happened , a traffic accident that claimed her husband 's life , that she was at least able for a period of time to walk away from and move up to the roadway , " the sheriff said			1
" and once she was on the roadway , that 's where we lost track of her			0
" he said he could n't speculate on whether or how badly @entity11 was injured in the crash			1
" she was at least able to get up to the road , " he said			2
police have her cell phone , he said			0
police have not ruled out the possibility that @entity11 was picked up by someone			1
but " if she was able to walk and able to move , how come she has n't contacted any of her family ? " @entity15 told @entity27			0
@entity11 was last seen wearing a red dress -- described by the @entity28 as a ball gown -- and a gray fleece hooded jacket , police said			1
the dress should have made her easy to spot in the rural , snowy landscape			0
" we were told from the family she was an extremely loving mother , " @entity15 told the @entity28			0
for her to just leave with no warning " would be incredibly out of character , " @entity15 said			0
" to be out in the elements as they were that night , dressed only as she was , it 's very doubtful that you can survive terribly long			0
" the crash site was remote , @entity15 told the newspaper			2
a nuclear power plant lies to the north , but the area is surrounded by farmland			0
" it 's crazy , " @entity29 told @entity27			0
" we 're holding on to every ounce of hope we have , just to hope for ( a ) safe return			0
... it 's been like a nightmare you ca n't wake up from			0
if anybody has anything , seen anything , please , please contact us , because these four girls need something			0
" @entity136 operations have so far involved dogs and aircraft from the @entity139 , along with more than 50 searchers , according to @entity27 and the sheriff 's office			0
@entity11 is described as being 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighing 125 pounds , with shoulder - length strawberry - blond hair and green eyes , according to the sheriff 's statement			1
it 's very mysterious what might have happened to @entity11 , " @entity29 told the @entity28			1
" we checked the area hospitals and nothing , so we do n't know if someone picked her up and took her somewhere			0
we just do n't know			0
" @entity15 said he 's never seen a case like this in his 12 years as sheriff			0
" anything that 's even remotely close has been gone over several times , " he told the newspaper			0
anyone with information regarding @entity11 's whereabouts is asked to contact the @entity161			1
@entity12 is about 70 miles northeast of @entity162 , @entity2 .			0
