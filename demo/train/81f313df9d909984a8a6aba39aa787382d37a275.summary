-- it does n't appear tracking down this piece of 9/11 history will be easy			2
tips have been rolling in , spurred by the @entity6 ' production , " @entity5 , " a documentary about the flag that three @entity10 firefighters hoisted above the @entity12 rubble in the aftermath of the attack			1
this particular version of @entity16 was 3 feet by 5 feet			0
photos and video from the site suggest it went missing fewer than six hours after a photographer with a @entity23 , @entity24 , newspaper captured the firefighters ' deed in a photo that would become one of the most -- if not the most -- iconic images from tragedy			1
co-director @entity31 said he expects that as news of the film infiltrates the tight - knit communities of @entity10 's firefighters , police officers , port authority workers and paramedics , more viable leads will come			1
" once more people from that world see it , i think we 're going to start learning a lot more , " he said , adding that he and co-director @entity40 examined more than 5,000 photos and viewed four days of television coverage from each of the networks during the documentary 's production			1
viewers began sharing leads before the documentary aired wednesday , as tv featured promos and @entity0 posted a preview			2
by wednesday night , there were a collective 50 tips to @entity0 's landing page , an e-mail tip line and @entity61			1
only a dozen or so were credible			0
of course , there was the obligatory yahoo claiming aliens took it -- but there were more sober sightings as well			0
a @entity69 woman said she saw it in the @entity71 in @entity72 , while another viewer wondered whether a flag he 'd seen at the @entity75 in @entity76 was the banner in question			1
other potential sightings came at @entity81 's @entity80 ; @entity83 's @entity82 in @entity84 ; the @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 ; and the hair and makeup department of the @entity10 @entity90 in @entity91			1
in one seemingly angry e-mail received before the documentary aired , a man using the name of a retired @entity10 police lieutenant slammed the firefighters			0
he accused them of stealing the flag ( the documentary explains how it was taken from a yacht docked near the trade center ) and claimed the iconic photo was staged and that the firefighters absconded with the flag after the picture was taken			1
" there had already been a few flags hoisted down at the site including the first flag to be hoisted by 2 officers from the @entity113 , " the tipster wrote			1
" since the @entity113 raised their flag in the immediate aftermath of the attack , there is still a ton of smoke and soot in the air , there are numerous rescue workers on scene ... several of whom are saluting			0
this is a much more original , natural , unrehearsed shot than the photo op taken much later			0
" the most credible tip , @entity31 said , came from a man who said a lighting company in @entity131 , @entity132 , that assisted with the 9/11 cleanup effort was in possession of the flag			1
but that flag turned out to be larger than the 9/11 flag , @entity31 said			1
@entity31 's hunch is that the flag 's disappearance involved nothing nefarious			1
" someone most likely saw it there and thought that 's a dirty , tattered flag and said , ' i 'm going to save that , ' " he said			2
" it 's going to be someone who either went there to volunteer with some specific skill or was a first responder			0
" if anything , i think someone 's intentions were very good			0
" while some tips are more feasible than others , @entity31 says , " they 're all legitimate because people have connections to these objects , to these symbols			0
" and perhaps more important than finding the flag is providing this outlet for catharsis , @entity31 said			0
many people have forgotten how they felt the day the towers came down			0
with a war - weary nation now considering military action in @entity170 , @entity31 believes discussing and searching for the 9/11 flag gives people an opportunity to revisit their emotions and " immerse themselves in the story of that day			2
" " it was the worst of days that somehow brought out the best in many @entity180 , " he said			0
" it 's more than looking for a flag			2
it 's about looking for that feeling			2
" help find the flag			0

the flag that became the *subject* of an iconic 9/11 photo went missing after it was hoisted
tips roll in after @entity6 ' documentary " @entity5 " airs , but none deemed viable
possible sighting have come in @entity91 , @entity84 , @entity76 and @entity131 , @entity132
co-director says , " it 's more than looking for a flag . it about looking for that feeling "
