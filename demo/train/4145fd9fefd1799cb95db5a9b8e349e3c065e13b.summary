the @entity0 on tuesday rejected a claim by a young @entity3 woman that @entity5 's ban on the wearing of burqas and niqabs in public violates her rights			1
the @entity5 law banning the burqa , a full - body covering that includes a mesh over the face , and the niqab , a full - face veil with an opening for the eyes , went into effect in april 2011			1
it has pitted religious freedom advocates against those who say the @entity24 veil is demeaning to women and inconsistent with @entity5 's rigorously enforced secularism			2
a 24 - year - old @entity5 woman brought the case to @entity30 's top rights court in @entity31 because she says the ban infringes on her ability to live according to her religious faith , culture and personal convictions			1
but the court said tuesday that it found that the @entity5 law does n't breach the @entity39			1
@entity3 woman 's case the woman , a devout muslim whose name has not been disclosed , had tried to draw on several articles of the convention to make her case			2
those articles cover the right to respect for private and family life ; the right to respect for freedom of thought , conscience and religion ; and the prohibition of discrimination			0
the woman said no member of her family has put pressure on her to wear the burqa and niqab			0
she wears them in public and private , but not all the time , she said			0
the @entity0 started hearing the case in november			0
debate in @entity5 the @entity66 said in 2010 that the law does not impose disproportionate punishments or prevent the free exercise of religion in a place of worship , finding therefore that " the law conforms to the @entity74			1
" but critics argue the government has no business telling people what clothes to wear or how to practice their religion			0
the law drew criticism from some human rights and religious organizations and some @entity3 as discriminatory			0
@entity5 has @entity30 's largest @entity3 population			2
the @entity5 law imposes a fine of 150 euros ( about $ 205 ) for wearing the items			1
the person breaking the law can be asked to carry out public service duty as part of the punishment or as an alternative to the fine			0
when the legislation came into effect , some analysts said it was largely born out of internal @entity5 politics , with former president @entity101 's center - right party seeking to fend off a challenge from a more hard - line right wing .			2
