-- the @entity1 and @entity2 on saturday authorized @entity3 to use chemical dispersants underwater to help break up the oil leaking into the @entity6			1
@entity3 and other authorities have already used more than 436,000 gallons of dispersants on the ocean 's surface , but the @entity1 says using it underwater could be even more effective			1
@entity0 takes a look at what dispersants are , how they work and what other effects they may have on humans and the environment			0
what are dispersants ? dispersants are a common product used to clean and control oil spills in the ocean			1
they are special fluid chemicals that bond to the oil molecules and separate them from water molecules , thus breaking up the oil			0
the result is tiny oil droplets that can biodegrade more quickly than a mass of oil			0
though they are chemicals , they are generally less harmful than the highly toxic oil , the @entity1 and @entity2 say			1
how are dispersants used ? dispersants are usually used on the surface of the ocean and distributed by aircraft flying over an oil spill			2
@entity3 said this week it has made more than 120 such flights to spread dispersant in the @entity6			1
using it underwater is a new idea , and @entity3 says it hopes to inject the dispersants directly into the oil flow at a point close to the main leak on the seabed			1
the technique could help break up and disperse the oil before it reaches the surface , @entity3 says			1
are dispersants harmful to the environment ? experts say dispersants , while toxic , are much less toxic than oil			1
using them on an oil spill produces the " lesser of two difficult environmental outcomes , " says @entity2 administrator @entity60			2
but some experts , including @entity62 of @entity64 's @entity63 , say dispersants still pose a problem for the environment			0
" almost certainly it 's going to have major effects down in the water to the marine life and , ultimately , this is the same marine life on which the birds and animals on the surface are dependent , " @entity62 told @entity0			0
scientists have warned that fish eggs and larvae , shrimp , coral and oysters are potentially most at risk from dispersants			0
the chemicals can also contaminate the skin of ocean - farmed fish if their cages are near where dispersants are used , according to the @entity89 , a nonprofit group that offers technical guidance on cleaning up spills			1
do dispersants pose any harm to humans ? the dispersant being used by @entity3 is made by the @entity96 based in @entity97 , @entity98			2
the company would not discuss the exact chemical makeup of the dispersant , @entity101 , in part because the formula is a trade secret			0
@entity101 comes with a warning that it can cause irritation to the eyes , skin and respiratory tract with prolonged contact			0
toxicologists and environmental scientists say , however , that dispersants are unlikely to cause immediate harm to people			0
@entity116 , scientific support coordinator with the @entity117 , has said the dispersants being used in the @entity6 show " fairly low toxicity			2
" @entity0 's @entity120 contributed to this report .			0

dispersants are a common product used to clean and control oil spills in the ocean
they are chemicals , but less harmful than the toxic oil , @entity1 and @entity2 say
@entity3 will try using dispersants underwater to break up oil *gushing* into @entity6
