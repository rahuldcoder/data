after living in the city for nearly 25 years , @entity0 says he will finally feel like a true @entity2			1
that is , he will if mayor @entity5 's proposal to issue municipal identification cards for undocumented residents is approved in the coming weeks			1
the @entity9 program would serve a half - million residents , regardless of their immigration status -- making it easier for them to report a crime , lease an apartment , open a bank account and even borrow a library book			1
" even if it 's just a temporary solution for undocumented immigrants , it would great to have this , " @entity0 said , " so if i ever get pulled over by cops again , we would be discussing why i was being pulled over instead of being questioned if my @entity9 was valid or not			2
" at a time of national debate about the status of millions of undocumented immigrants in the @entity26 , some municipalities have taken steps aimed at improving their lives			2
" to all of my fellow @entity2 who are undocumented , i say : @entity2 is your home , too , and we will not force any of our residents to live their lives in the shadows , " @entity5 said during his first @entity32 speech february 10			1
the @entity9 cards would serve undocumented immigrants as well as the homeless , low - income elderly people , former prisoners and members of the @entity42 community who may have difficulty obtaining other government - issued ids			2
@entity0 , 30 , said even his 70 - year - old mother looked forward to getting a library card with her municipal @entity9 , which would " give her some sense of belonging			0
" before being eligible for federal deferred action for childhood arrivals ( @entity54 ) status , @entity0 said , he used his @entity56 passport as identification , which caused some awkward encounters			2
" i have a driver 's license now thanks to @entity54 , but it says ' @entity63 ' in bold and it always confuses people and raises a lot of questions , " said @entity0 , who is an undocumented immigrant and law school graduate fighting for admission into the @entity61			2
@entity54 is a federal program enacted in 2012			2
it granted some undocumented young people temporary work authorization and a two - year reprieve from deportation			2
@entity2 's @entity9 program would be similar programs in 11 other cities , including @entity75 and @entity76 ; @entity77 , @entity78 ; @entity79 ; and @entity80 , @entity81			1
but opponents of @entity5 's proposal say the measure encourages illegal immigration and could be misused by terrorists			1
" one of the reasons the 9/11 terrorists were so successful was because they had access to official identification , but since advocates of illegal immigrants carry a lot of political clout , local government will play up to that , " @entity87 , media director of the @entity88 , told @entity89			1
the @entity9 program has its limitations : the cards will not be accepted by federal agencies as a form of identification , serve as a driver 's license , or be valid to purchase alcohol or tobacco			1
applicants would have to appear in person and present other identification , such as a passport , and proof of residency , such a utility bill or lease			2
@entity118 , co-founder of the @entity119 , said the program was a step in the right direction			0
" it makes a lot of sense for @entity2 and , at the risk of sounding like a cliché , it does bring people out of the shadows , " @entity118 said			1
" undocumented immigrants who participate economically and socially should have these ids			0
immigration is a very powerful economic motor			0
" for the cards to be effective , they need to be broadly accessible , linked up with private and public services , and be widely used by people who are not undocumented immigrants , @entity139 , supervising attorney at the @entity2 - based @entity141 , told @entity89			1
as for @entity0 , he believes there 's a chance undocumented immigrants could be singled out when using @entity2 ids , but he believes the benefits outweigh the costs			1
" it 's just going to take some work from the city to educate banks and city agencies to recognize these ids , " @entity0 said			0
@entity75 's example could be a template			1
that city has issued nearly 20,000 cards since its program was launched in 2009 , an average of 4,000 a year			0
public safety concerns , in part , motivated the @entity75 program			1
" residents without access to bank accounts often carry large amounts of money on them or store it in their homes , making them targets for crime			0
and , those who ca n't produce proof of identity are often reluctant to report crimes to the police , " said @entity172 of the @entity75 city administrator 's budget and planning office			1
although immigrants are victimized by crime at rates similar to or greater than the general population , they report crime at lower rates , according to studies			0
the underreporting of crime poses a serious public safety problem and erodes the ability of law enforcement to function effectively in the city			1
immigrant advocates hope that the municipal ids will bridge the gap between police and undocumented immigrants , as was the case in @entity80 , @entity81			0
@entity80 was the first city to start an @entity9 program			0
it has issued more than 12,000 municipal ids in seven years			0
" over the years , it 's helped residents feel like @entity80 is home and they 're a part of the community			1
for immigrants , it begins the process of assimilation and puts them on the road to full community participation , " said @entity207 , @entity80 's director of communications			0
@entity213 , public information officer for the @entity214 , said he saw the need for the cards during his 19 years as an officer			0
" we used to get calls from third - party complaints , like a church calling and acting as an intermediary , " he said			0
" the undocumented folks would shy away from us			0
they did n't know they could come to us without being questioned about their immigration status			0
it opened up a dialogue between the police and immigrant communities that did n't exist before			0

@entity2 identification program aims to help undocumented residents
the program models those in 11 other cities *nationwide*
opponents say the program could enable *potential* terrorists
public safety concerns , in part , motivated a similar program in @entity75
