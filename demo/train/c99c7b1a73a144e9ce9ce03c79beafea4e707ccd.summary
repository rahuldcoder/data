@entity0 -- it might be surprising that in a country as wealthy , multicultural and big as @entity4 , one of the key election battles is about asylum seekers and refugees			1
both major parties are engaged in a race to the bottom about how best to shut down @entity4 as a place of refuge for people who take to the sea			1
asylum seekers are an easy target for anxieties about national security , unemployment and demographic composition			2
politicians have fueled fears that asylum seekers present a threat not only to the integrity of our borders , but to the national fabric as a whole			2
their policies rely on a spurious dichotomy between the " good refugee " ( who waits patiently in a camp to be resettled in a faraway land ) and the " bad refugee " ( who " jumps the queue " by engaging people smugglers to come by boat )			1
international law makes no such distinction because a person either has a well - founded fear of persecution and is in need of protection , or does not			0
@entity4 's bid to stop ' queue jumpers ' the " queue jumper " narrative has permeated so deeply that it has enabled both political parties to construct extraordinary legislative and policy interventions : mandatory detention for all unlawful arrivals ; the excision of the whole @entity4 mainland from @entity4 's " migration zone ; " the removal of boat arrivals to offshore processing centers in small @entity65 island countries , with no prospect for resettlement in @entity4 ; and the creation of temporary protection visas , barring " genuine " refugees from family reunion and permanent residence			1
despite originally decrying such draconian measures as inhuman and illegal , the @entity75 government , led by prime minister @entity76 , has built upon many of them and increased their severity			1
for a time , it explained that its deterrence measures had an underlying humanitarian objective -- to " save lives at sea			0
" but the latest iterations of its policy reveal a strong message of punitive deterrence			0
opinion : why @entity4 's asylum plan wo n't work in 2012 , the @entity75 government reopened offshore processing centers in @entity94 and @entity95 , despite vowing it would never do so			1
the idea was that the inferior conditions there , lack of legal advice and review mechanisms , and delayed resettlement ( around five years ) would deter asylum seekers from getting on boats			2
but it did n't work , largely because it ignores the reasons why people seek protection in the first place			1
so the government took it a step further , declaring in july 2013 that asylum seekers arriving by boat would now be sent to @entity95 for processing and resettlement			1
as full - page newspaper advertisements explained : " if you come here by boat without a visa you wo n't be settled in @entity4			1
" the opposition 's political plan the opposition coalition , led by @entity124 , countered with disincentives of its own			0
first , if elected in a federal vote on september 7 , it will expand offshore processing and actively seek other resettlement countries for boat arrivals found to be refugees			1

refugee status will be reassessed every three years , family reunion will be banned , and only work for the dole will be allowed			0
the deleterious psychological effects of this " limbo " protection have been well documented			0
furthermore , the last time the policy was used , more women and children got on to boats because of the bar on family reunions			0
many died in the process			0
secondly , the @entity153 would appoint a three - star commander to protect @entity4 's borders			1
this is because it views the continued arrival of boat people as a national emergency requiring a military - led response			2
but according to a former chief of @entity4 's defense force , this is a misguided policy that would change nothing			2
asylum seekers are not a defense issue			0
thirdly , the @entity153 also promises to " turn back the boats " when it is safe to do so			2
but it rarely will be because it is illegal to expose people to a risk of persecution or turn back an unseaworthy vessel and place the lives of passengers at risk			0
it also suggested it would buy up @entity182 fishing vessels to stop those boats being used by people smugglers , a suggestion that was dismissed by the @entity182 government as unworkable and derogatory			2
fourthly , the @entity153 has threatened to abolish the @entity187 ( @entity188 ) , the independent body that reviews decisions made by government officials about whether or not people are refugees			1
this is because the @entity188 has found that many governmental decisions are flawed			0
but rather than probing the quality of government decision making , the @entity153 has decided to get rid of the reviewer			1
this undermines a central tenet of a functioning administrative law system			0
life or death decisions can not be reviewed			0
further , the @entity153 's weekend announcement that it will strip legal aid from asylum seekers increases this risk of poor initial decision making and heightens the chance of refoulement -- or the expulsion of people with the right to be recognized as refugees			1
a ' breach of international human rights ' both @entity75 and @entity153 policies breach @entity4 's international human rights obligations in various ways			1
at the very least , they undermine the humanitarian purpose of the @entity221			0
more significantly , they violate concrete legal obligations -- such as the individual right to seek asylum ( and the right not to be subjected to penalties for arriving without a visa in such cases ) , the right to be free from cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , the right not to be arbitrarily detained , and the right to non-discrimination			0
a recent report by the @entity237 @entity236 underscored this			0
but because @entity4 has no bill of rights , it is very difficult to challenge such policies in domestic courts			2
experience tells us that these policies do not " stop the boats			0
" as former @entity4 prime minister @entity252 recently observed , " no amount of deterrence can match the terror from which those who are genuine refugees are fleeing			2
" instead , they lead to increased levels of trauma and mental illness among refugee communities , exorbitant financial costs , and desperate family members undertaking dangerous boat voyages to try to join their loved ones			0
moreover , asylum seekers get on boats because @entity4 tries to prevent their arrival by other means			1
there is no such thing as a " refugee visa " to apply for before departure , and it is highly unlikely that refugees would be able to get a tourist or work visa because of the presumption that they would apply for asylum on arrival			0
@entity4 is one of the few countries in the @entity278 that could offer durable protection to refugees , since most of its neighbors have not ratified the @entity221 and do not have the legal , financial or technical capacity to offer real protection			2
how many asylum seekers are there ? to put all of this into context , in 2012 @entity4 received 17,202 asylum seekers by boat , its highest annual number , but only 1.47 % of the world 's asylum seekers			1
in the same period , it accepted 190,000 people through its skilled and family migration scheme			0
on a positive note , both parties will continue to resettle refugees directly from camps and urban settlements in other countries , as well as asylum seekers who come by plane who are found to be refugees			0
the total number of refugees accepted by @entity4 -- whether by overseas resettlement , plane arrivals or boat arrivals -- will be capped at 13,750 by the @entity153			1
@entity75 will increase that number to 20,000 , and possibly up to 27,000 if there is a significant decline in the number of asylum seekers arriving by boat			1
public perception at fault ? the public perception is that asylum numbers are much higher than this , and many people do not understand why people flee in the first place			1
given @entity4 's relative affluence and political stability , most voters have no conception of what it means to fear persecution or other forms of serious harm			2
in fact , perhaps the saddest irony of all is that precisely because the asylum issue has such a negligible impact on most @entity4 ' everyday lives , they can choose to remain ignorant about the issue			1
yet it still drives votes			0
finally , the more that asylum seekers are made to disappear from our community , the less chance there is for @entity4 to get to know them as neighbors , colleagues or friends			1
as this happens , the chance for greater empathy and understanding also disappears			0
join us on @entity353 / @entity352			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity356 .			2

@entity75 government sending people who arrive by boat to offshore processing centers
@entity153 says thousands already in @entity4 wo n't be allowed to stay
@entity356 : " queue jumper " narrative has permeated @entity4 society
public perception is that asylum numbers are much higher than reality
