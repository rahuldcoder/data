-- on a recent january night near the @entity3 section of @entity4 , @entity1 was shooting @entity7 's new @entity6 spy thriller show , " the @entity8			1
" she 's receiving praise from @entity10 about some recent espionage work she 's done as they go for a nightly stroll in a secluded park			1
planes are flying overhead , along with a few lingering high school kids interrupting her train of thought , but @entity19 rarely wavers			2
she 's stoic and serious , and her brow often looks slightly furrowed , which is exactly what you 'd expect from someone playing a @entity25 spy			1
in between takes , she 's out of character , talking about her kids , the @entity29 and how tired she thinks she ought to be			2
a call of " action " rings out , and just like that , she 's back in spy mode			1
' " the @entity8 , " which premieres at 10 p.m. et wednesday on @entity7 , takes place in the early ' 80s in the @entity36 area			1
the show comes from @entity39 ( " @entity42 " ) , who trained to be a @entity41 case officer from 1990 to 1994			2
in 2010 , when the arrest of a @entity6 spy network broke ( including @entity47 ) , his bosses at @entity44 were inspired and thought of him and his former undercover life , and " the @entity8 " was born			1
but right from the start , it was n't going to be a rehashing of @entity53 - ian gadgets and crazy - named villains			2
the creators wanted to tell the story of two @entity6 who were brought up and trained to be undercover @entity25 agents and would pose as @entity8 to gather intelligence during the @entity59			1
the twist is these two agents , @entity62 ( @entity19 ) and @entity63 ( @entity64 ) , would be married			1
they 'd buy @entity8 products , such as high - waisted @entity68			1
they 'd do everything a typical nuclear family of the times would do , except it 's all a coy cover			1
" i 'd just had my second baby and a week later , people called and said , ' we 're so awful to do this , but if you were at all interested in doing another series , this is the one , ' " @entity19 recalls			1
" i said no a couple times			2
... i ca n't be playing a spy			1
but it had so many different elements that were complicated			2
" that 's not to say that " the @entity8 " does n't employ classic spy techniques			1
there 's a bevy of costumes , people sleep with each other for power and information , and there are a lot of brutal fights			2
in the pilot episode , @entity19 kicks a guy 's head through a wall , while co-star @entity64 stabs a guy in the crotch with a large fork			2
but @entity103 said he did n't want to make a show that treaded familiar territory			2
he was more interested in the familial dynamics			2
" one of the reasons i wanted to do a show was about the family and not just about a @entity25 spy who comes to @entity8 , " @entity103 said			1
" it 's about a couple with kids who do n't know what ( their parents ) do			2
this is an emotional show about a marriage and raising children			2
i think my interest in that came from working at the @entity41 and seeing those people			0
" both @entity19 and @entity64 echoed those sentiments			0
" the marriage part is the most interesting to me , " @entity19 said			0
" i love the idea of this arranged marriage , how they are a couple			0
i love the idea that ( @entity62 ) is stunted emotionally , and after all these years , only now , she may be ready to open up and be in a real relationship with him			0
you get to see her so dominant and adventurous sexually outside of her marriage , but at home she 's so reserved and pulled in			0
i like the complicated aspect of her in that way			0
" @entity64 added , " that was the great attraction to the pilot , as much as any boy wants to do a spy thriller			1
the potential for this incredibly layered dynamic ... when you first meet ( @entity63 and @entity62 ) , they 're in this brittle place			0
it makes for a great springboard into a series			1
that 's where the journey is over the season -- this roller coaster of them trying to figure out what their path is , what the present is and what the future is			0
" @entity19 's last series was the short - lived @entity168 comedy " @entity169 " in 2010			1
" the @entity8 " marks her return to dramatic television , with her last big role as @entity174 in @entity177 ' @entity176 series , " @entity178			1
" @entity19 is older now , with kids of her own , but she still relates to @entity178 much more than her new role as @entity62			1
" ( @entity178 ) is much more like me , " she said			1
" embarrassed all the time , super-emotional , nerdy , absolutely socially awkward			0
but in a way , what 's great , @entity62 is socially awkward , too			0
she does have to be forward and sexual at times , but she 's doing it to get something			0
her having sex is much more informative about her character ; it 's not to get intimacy			0
" " the @entity8 " will likely be compared to @entity194 's " homeland , " mainly because both shows ' plots center on enemies of the state			1
but in many ways , the similarities end there			0
by being set in the early ' 80s , there 's an inherent technological aspect about " the @entity8 " -- or lack there of -- that 's very noticeable			1
" it 's old school , " @entity19 says			0
" there 's no technology ; there 's no phone			0
it 's all personal intel			0
it 's not like ' i got the text ! ' " there is another parallel between the two series , but it 's up to viewers ' perceptions and how they greet the anti-hero aspects of @entity19 's and @entity64 ' characters			1
" if you look at ' homeland , ' the way you find yourself feeling about @entity226 ' character , you catch yourself saying , " @entity228 ' " @entity64 said about rooting for the bad guy			0
" ' @entity229 ' ( is like that ) in the same sort of way			0
your reaction to those characters will be human			0
" @entity103 agrees : " ( @entity239 ) will be rooting for @entity63 and @entity62 and hoping they succeed , and all of a sudden , they 'll think ' @entity237 , ' they just did this horrible thing			0
how could i have been rooting for them ? " back in @entity4 , as the temperature drops , @entity19 and @entity10 continue going through takes			0
at one point , @entity19 gets a break because the crew has to readjust the lighting			0
" thank @entity247 , there 's not a lot of @entity6 speaking , " she admits , while walking back to start			1
" we 're just juggling a lot of things			0
you 're doing sneaky things , but the whole point is to not be sneaky			0
" moments later , she demonstrates how to kick someone 's head through a wall			0
like a true spy , she 's able to turn it on and off -- just like that .			1
