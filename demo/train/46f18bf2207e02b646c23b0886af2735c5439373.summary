-- although the war in @entity5 began on april 6,1992 , my involvement in the conflict did n't start until july 23 , when @entity0 photojournalist @entity6 was shot by a sniper and nearly killed			1
i was part of a @entity0 team sent in to replace my wounded colleague and spent more than two years covering the story			1
last week , the 20th anniversary of the conflict , i returned to @entity14 for a reunion of journalists who covered the war			1
while @entity6 was being medivaced to a hospital in @entity18 , i arrived in the @entity5 capital on a @entity21 flight from @entity22 , @entity23			1
when i landed i saw another @entity21 aircraft unloading on the tarmac nearby			2
it had a delegation from @entity28 that included @entity31 prime minister @entity30			2
he was attempting to find ways to end the war			1
many crews were covering @entity30 's trip , including one from @entity36			1
i recognized reporter @entity37 and producer @entity38			2
i 'd known both of them while covering presidential trips during the @entity42			2
while i was busy collecting my gear , @entity37 and a cameraman got into an armored @entity21 transport with @entity46 and headed into the city			2
the vehicle was too small to include @entity49 , but a few minutes later another television crew offered him a ride into @entity14 in their ' soft - skinned ' van , with tv written in black tape across the back			1
@entity49 jumped in but did not have a bullet - resistant vest , so he was seated between two other journalists who were wearing protective gear			2
moments after leaving the airport a shot rang out			2
a sniper had hit the van between the letters t and @entity66 the bullet went through the tailgate into the rear seat and killed @entity49			1
this tragic scene was the first of many memories i would collect during a war that would last nearly four years			1
last year , a couple of veteran reporters having drinks at a bar decided to mark the 20th anniversary of the @entity80 with a reunion of war journalists			1
since i had spent nearly two and a half years on the ground during the war , i was invited			1
i had no idea what to expect			2
i had n't been back to the war - ravaged city since the @entity89 accords were signed in 1995 , officially ending the conflict			1
this time i flew into the airport on a commercially scheduled airline , not a military transport			1
the military aircraft , @entity21 workers , and tons of relief supplies present for the longest humanitarian airlift in history had faded into the past			2
instead of loading into an armored car , i secured a local taxi to drive into the city			0
i thought about the countless times our team would confront the challenges of the dreaded airport road and was happy no one had to worry about it any more			0
i also thought about @entity38 and his family			0
i always rolled tape while traveling the lengthy stretch of road from the airport into the city			0
i wanted a visual record in case i got hit			0
i decided to record the trip again , so i could compare images from then and now			0
the abandoned tank , disabled early in the war , was no longer on the side of the road			1
instead , the street was lined with small shops and businesses			0
some of the buildings were still scarred by the intense fighting that occurred , but now pedestrians walked up and down the busy thoroughfare			0
when snipers were present , we used to drive as fast as the armored car was capable of going			0
this time , thankfully , there was so much traffic on the road that the trip seemed to take forever			1
i enjoyed every minute of it			0
inside the city there were new large apartment block , shopping malls and a renovated tram system filled with riders			0
what was the biggest change i saw ? how about a drive - thru @entity147 on a former snipers ' alley ! some people might have a problem with an @entity154 fast food restaurant in the heart of @entity14 but the folks working there expressed pleasure at just having a job			1
on the way to the @entity163 , which was the main gathering place for the international press corps during the siege , both sides of the street were crowded with families walking under a warm afternoon sun. along the way there were also stark reminders of the war			1
the @entity172 , where @entity21 personnel once lived , was a burned out shell			0
it was near there where @entity6 was shot			0
as i arrived at the @entity163 i was pleased to see it had been renovated to how it looked before the war			1
built as a host hotel for the @entity182 , the @entity163 was heavily damaged by artillery and tank shells			0
it had been a focal point for sniper and small arms fire			1
rocket propelled grenades had routinely hit the hotel 's exterior walls			1
now , the windows were intact , electricity and water restored			0
we no longer had to cross no - mans - land from back roads into the underground garage to avoid snipers			0
as i entered the lobby i soon noticed one thing had n't changed			0
everywhere i looked i saw the same hotel staff that we bonded with during the war			2
they were all older , of course , but looked a lot healthier and seemed truly happy to reconnect with the returning journalists			1
@entity209 smiles and misty eyes preceded huge hugs as former friendships were recalled			0
i felt like i had never left			0
for the anniversary of the start of the war the city of @entity14 decided to memorialize the occasion by lining up 11,541 red chairs in rows , filling the main street in the city center			1
each empty chair represented a man , woman or child who was killed during the 44 month siege			0
when i heard about the project it did n't have much of an impact on me			0
when i saw it , i was overwhelmed			0
the empty seats went on and on , around the corner and off into the distance			0
red banners with white numbers , 11,541 , were attached to poles along the route on both sides of the street			0
in the section dedicated to children there were about 1,600 smaller chairs			0
friends and relatives carefully and reverently placed flowers , stuffed animals and mementos on the empty seats as a light rain fell			2
towards the end of the service a choir , filled with children 's voices , sang the anti-war standard , " @entity257			2
" even some of my most battle - hardened war journalist friends admitted the moisture on their faces did n't come from the rain			1
it 's a lot easier to rebuild structures than heal ethnic divides magnified by atrocities of war but i am hopeful @entity14 and @entity5 are heading in the right direction .			1

@entity0 photojournalist @entity271 returned to @entity5 for the first time since the war
he sees big changes in @entity14 and friends , 20 years on , look older but healthier
@entity278 's on sniper alley sounds *incongruous* but provides jobs in new @entity14
