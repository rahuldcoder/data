@entity0 -- accidents happen , said the @entity3 , but the criminal penalties can still be tough , at least for one " bungling bank robber			1
" the case involved @entity7 , arrested after he and a partner robbed a bank five years ago			1
by a 7 - 2 vote , the justices ruled wednesday that the sentencing for a felon who accidentally fired a gun during a crime should be the same as if he had fired intentionally			1
the case involved @entity7 , arrested after he and a partner robbed a @entity20 , @entity21 , bank five years ago			2
the masked @entity7 had waved a gun and ordered patrons and staff to get down			2
while grabbing bills in one hand , the gun he was carrying in his other hand went off			0
the bullet hit a partition , and no one was injured			0
after the shot , @entity7 cursed and immediately ran out of the bank			2
witnesses later testified he seemed surprised the weapon had gone off			0
@entity7 was charged in federal court and admitted committing the robbery			2
his sentence included a mandatory 10 - year prison term for " discharging " a weapon during a crime			1
he appealed , saying the sentencing enhancement required proof that he intended to discharge the firearm , and his actions were accidental			0
but in his majority opinion , chief justice @entity46 said federal law " does not require that the discharge be done knowingly or intentionally			1
" in what has become a regular feature of his writing , the 54 - year - old chief justice displayed a sense of creativity and sly humor in his conclusions			1
he openly called @entity7 the " bungling bank robber " and quoted one patron 's reaction to the bank gunshot : " @entity62 in the lobby popped up and said , ' oh , my @entity64 , has he shot @entity65 ? ' " @entity65 turned out to be all right			1
justice @entity66 dissented in the case , noting , " accidents happen , but they seldom give rise to criminal liability			0
indeed , if they cause no harm they seldom give rise to any liability			0
the court nevertheless holds that petitioner is subject to a mandatory additional sentence -- a species of criminal liability -- for an accident that caused no harm			0
" he was supported by justice @entity85			0
@entity46 , however , saved the best for last in his bench remarks , when summarizing the ruling			0
" an individual who brings a loaded weapon to commit a crime runs the risk that the gun will discharge accidentally , " he said			2
" those criminals wishing to avoid the penalty for an inadvertent discharge can lock or unload the firearm , handle it with care during the underlying violent or drug trafficking crime , leave the gun at home , or -- best yet -- avoid committing the felony in the first place , " @entity46 wrote that brought barely contained laughter in the audience of several hundred gathered in the courtroom .			1
