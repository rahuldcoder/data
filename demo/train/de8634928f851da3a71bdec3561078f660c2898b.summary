-- @entity1 and @entity2 have been quietly developing a sequel to " @entity4 " for awhile now			2
back in october , we heard that @entity7 and @entity8 -- the comedy screenwriting duo behind " @entity10 " and " mr. @entity11 " -- were hard at work on a script			1
that was the last bit of news about the project ... at least until this weekend , when @entity1 dropped a @entity19 - imploding bombshell in the middle of a " @entity22 " press junket			1
" we 're getting set to shoot @entity25 in september , " the director told @entity24			1
" we 've got @entity26 and @entity27 back			0
" @entity1 may have jumped the gun a little bit -- a source close to the production tells @entity0 that the film is " moving along , but it 's not greenlit yet			2
" it 's hard to imagine a green light is too far away , though -- following last week 's announcement about the impending arrival of " @entity38 , " this feels like the moment for long - awaited comedy sequels			0
