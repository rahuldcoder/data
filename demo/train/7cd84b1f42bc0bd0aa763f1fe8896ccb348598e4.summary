@entity0 -- @entity2 has the lowest voter turnout rate in the country			1
as part of a new @entity1 project called @entity8 , i 'm trying to create a conversation that could change that			1
but i 'll need your help to make it work			1
here 's what you can do : in the gallery at the top of this story you 'll find information about six nonvoters in @entity2			1
they have some interesting reasons for not voting			1
one is a high school student who has specific political interests but says he feels too young and uninformed to participate in something as serious as voting			1
@entity2 : the state that does n't vote another does n't want @entity2 to be part of the @entity30 , so she does n't participate on principle , even though she could try to vote in leaders that would push against statehood			1
another was driving to the polls during a recent election and turned back because she heard the winner of the presidential race announced on her car radio			2
@entity2 is six hours behind @entity44			2
when you find someone you like , send them a message on @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 -- wherever , as long as the post is public			2
just be sure to include the hashtag you see on their images -- # @entity59 through # ctl6			2
@entity59 means " change the list			1
" you also can send video messages to the nonvoters in the comments section at the bottom of this page			0
again , please tag them # ctl1 , # @entity67 , etc. i 'm collecting the messages and will relay them to the nonvoters			0
you can see the responses other people have sent on these pages : messages to @entity75 messages to @entity77 messages to @entity79 messages to @entity81 messages to @entity83 messages to @entity85 before i go , a half - desparate appeal to civility : these people kindly and bravely agreed to be part of this experiment			0
please treat them with respect			0
give a piece of your story : why do you vote ? or why is it important to you that everyone takes part in our democracy ? personal attacks will not be featured on the site			0
ok , that hall - monitor moment is over			0
after the election , i 'll report back on which , if any , of these nonvoters changes their minds			0
subscribe to the @entity109 for updates			0
and thanks for your help !			0
