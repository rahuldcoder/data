@entity0 is done but this year 's electoral fight between the @entity3 establishment and the tea party movement is far from over			1
moderates scored a victory on tuesday in @entity9 's @entity3 @entity8 primary when state house speaker @entity10 topped 40 % of the vote , avoiding a runoff in july			1
5 takeaways from @entity9 primaries @entity10 beat a bunch of more conservative candidates for the chance to face off this november against first - term @entity19 sen. @entity18 , who is considered very vulnerable in the general election			1
flipping her seat and five others held by @entity19 would give @entity3 control of the @entity8			1
" there are plenty of fights still to come , and it 's too early to proclaim a winner and a loser			0
but it 's already clear that the pragmatist conservatives have stopped the anti-establishment 's electoral momentum , " writes @entity31 , editor and publisher of the non-partisan @entity31			0
victories by more moderate mainstream candidates improve the @entity3 's odds of recapturing the @entity8			1
@entity19 hold a 55 - 45 majority but are defending 21 of the 36 seats up this year			0
half of those @entity19 seats are in red or purple states , like @entity9			1
mainstream strikes back since the birth of the tea party movement in 2009 , primary challenges from the right have produced major headlines and headaches for the @entity3 and hurt the party 's chances of recapturing the @entity8 in the past two election cycles			1
candidates backed by the tea party and other grass - roots conservatives effectively cost the @entity3 five winnable @entity8 elections in 2010 and 2012 in @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
@entity3 establishment 1 , tea party 0 after early primary test this time , mainstream republicans do n't want another sequel			1
in @entity9 , @entity10 grabbed last - minute endorsements from two high - profile @entity3 : 2012 presidential nominee @entity71 and former @entity73 gov. @entity72 , a potential 2016 @entity74 hopeful			1
more importantly , while none of the candidates in the @entity3 primary , including @entity10 , raised or spent a lot of money , the state house speaker won the backing of the @entity83 @entity82 and @entity84			2
those outside groups spent $ 2.6 million combined to run ads in favor of the candidate			0
that spending dwarfed money shelled out by outside conservative groups that backed @entity92 , a first time candidate endorsed by sen. @entity93 , who finished second in the @entity8 primary			1
what 's at stake in 2014 ? " last night was a victory for @entity3 who believe we should nominate the most conservative candidate who can win in november versus the @entity105 interest groups who believe the weaker the @entity3 is , the more powerful they are , " said @entity3 strategist @entity97 , who served as @entity99 communications director the past two election cycles			2
was @entity9 a true test ? but some conservative strategists say the showdown in @entity9 was anything but a fair fight			2
" when the establishment candidate is the only player on the field actually spending significant money and also runs as conservative , they have an easy path to victory , " @entity112 , policy director for the @entity113 , told @entity114			2
" however , you can only fool the people some of the time and eventually they will have to vouch for their support of amnesty , debt ceiling increases , tweaking @entity126 , and corporate welfare			0
no degree of cash advantage can sell that pig to primary voters , " he said			0
since a number of influential tea party groups and conservative organizations stayed on the sidelines in @entity9 , some strategists say the contest was not a true indicator in the fight between the establishment and the grassroots movement			1
" the breathless declarations on the death of the @entity145 are so premature it 's laughable			2
the tea party was split in @entity9 ( or stayed out entirely )			1
any one pointing to these elections as indicative does n't understand the indicators of a true tea party versus establishment contest , " wrote conservative pollster @entity148			1
more battles ahead there are primary elections virtually every tuesday over the next five weeks , so there are more skirmishes to come			2
key races to watch in 2014 may 13 : next tuesday , the tea party could score what could end up being its only win in @entity8 primary showdowns this year			1
conservative @entity164 of @entity165 , president of @entity167 , has been showered with support and endorsements recently from former @entity171 gov. @entity170 , the 2008 @entity3 vice presidential nominee , and sens. @entity173 of @entity174 and @entity175 of @entity176 , as well as the backing of @entity178 , the @entity179 and @entity180			0
some polling suggests that @entity164 is tied with @entity182 , the former state treasurer who 's considered the establishment favorite			2
but on the same day , seven - term rep. @entity184 is expected to easily win the @entity3 @entity8 nomination in @entity186 , where the party hopes to snatch the seat long held by retiring @entity19 sen. @entity189			1
capito is considered a moderate , and while some conservative groups criticized her early in her bid , she 's faced no serious opposition from the right for the nomination			0
but a tea party - backed candidate might win the @entity3 nomination in @entity186 's 2nd @entity199 , the @entity74 seat that @entity190 has held for seven terms			1
may 20 : a week later , the action moves to @entity203 , where @entity205 @entity204 faces a challenge , and @entity207 , where there 's a wide open fight to succeed retiring @entity3 sen. @entity210			0
@entity211 is challenged by businessman @entity212 , who enjoys strong support from many tea party groups and influential conservative organizations			1
while the race has seen big spending by the campaigns and outside groups , the five - term @entity211 is expected to cruise to renomination			0
but he faces a serious challenge in november from rising @entity19 star @entity224			0
big - name democrats are already campaigning for her			2
in @entity207 , @entity3 reps			0
@entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 , former @entity207 secretary of state @entity231 , and businessman @entity232 are the major candidates in the race			2
@entity235 , @entity232 and @entity236 , rather than the more conservative @entity229 and @entity228 , are considered frontrunners in the contentious @entity3 primary			0
the winner will face @entity240 , the all - but - certain @entity19 nominee and daughter of former sen. @entity242 , a household name in @entity207			0
on the same day in @entity246 , @entity245 pediatric neurosurgeon @entity244 is considered the frontrunner over more conservative state rep. @entity248 in the race for the @entity3 @entity8 nomination			2
the winner of that contest will run in november against first - term @entity19 sen. @entity254 , who @entity3 think might be vulnerable if 2014 turns into a wave year for the @entity3			0
and in @entity257 , there 's a high - profile incumbent - vs. - tea party showdown in the @entity74 , where eight - term rep. @entity260 faces a serious primary challenge from conservative favorite @entity262			1
june 3 : two weeks later , the establishment - vs. - tea party contest shifts to @entity264 , which is among eight states holding primaries that day			1
six - term sen. @entity267 is facing a serious challenge from state lawmaker @entity269 in @entity264			0
private polling shows @entity267 with a comfortable lead , but outside establishment groups are taking nothing for granted			2
fight is far from over the @entity82 , which represents business interests , says it 's going up on television starting wednesday with a very large ad buy in two @entity8 contests and 11 @entity74 races , which include some key establishment vs. @entity145 primary showdowns			1
while mainstream candidates appear to have the upper hand in most of these upcoming showdowns , tea party leaders say do n't count them out			1
in the days ahead , we 're supporting some great candidates in competitive primaries , " @entity287 spokesman @entity286 told @entity114			2
" in my home state of @entity264 , there 's a war going on ; @entity269 is poised to take down a six - term incumbent @entity83 senator			0
i have n't seen such a hotly contested primary in 20 years , " he said			0
even if the establishment rolls to victory after victory in this year 's primaries , a top analyst says this battle is far from over			0
" no matter the wins and losses in the @entity3 ' civil war ' this year , do n't expect this to be the end of that fight			0
the party remains deeply divided , and both sides have the resources and commitment needed to take the fight into 2015 and 2016			0
the war is likely to get messier and the division more consequential before the two sides look for ways to bridge their differences			0
that should please @entity19 , " @entity31 wrote .			0
