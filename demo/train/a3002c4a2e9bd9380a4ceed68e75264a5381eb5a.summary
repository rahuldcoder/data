he said it was quickly brought under control , and the government reported a few hours later that the base was calm			0
initial investigations suggest that @entity26 , @entity4 's northern neighbor and former ruler , may have had a hand in the mutiny , @entity19 said			1
@entity26 denied involvement in the incident			2
" @entity17 has pulled yet another @entity33 prank			2

" but it has never before been claimed that @entity26 is trying to overthrow the @entity4 government with the help of the @entity4 armed forces			1
in this regard , we once again reiterate that @entity26 does not interfere in the internal affairs of @entity4 on principle			1
we do not believe in scripts imposed from the outside			0
