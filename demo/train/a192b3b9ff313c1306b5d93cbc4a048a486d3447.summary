-- @entity2 's decision to pull out of the @entity4 primary before the @entity6 vote on saturday could provide just the boost that @entity8 , or even @entity9 , needs to edge out @entity10			1
should this happen , would it be bad for the former @entity13 governor ? in the long run , it might actually help him			2
if @entity10 were to win the @entity6 primary , it 's hard to imagine him losing in @entity20 10 days later			1
the bandwagon effect , where voters gravitate to the candidate they think will probably win , will go into overdrive			1
it already gave @entity10 a huge push after @entity27 and @entity28 although @entity9 is claiming victory in @entity27 after new numbers have come in			1
@entity10 , nevertheless , is favored to win nearly all of the @entity4 primaries or caucuses that will be held in february , beginning with @entity34 , where @entity36 voters made up 25 % of caucus participants in 2008			1
so , even though a very small percentage of the delegates to @entity41 will have been allocated , the @entity4 primary could be all but over by early february , and we could embark on one of the longest general election campaigns in history			0
the @entity10 campaign would surely be happy at this development , but a quick end to the competitive phase of the @entity4 primary contest may not be in the candidate 's best interests			1
when a sitting president is running for re-election , it is at least partially a referendum on the incumbent			0
this is clearly what the @entity4 want			0
but a short @entity4 primary gives the @entity62 team much more of an opportunity to convert this into a referendum on their opponent			0
party primaries can be divisive and expensive , but they offer distractions that keep the campaigns , the public and the media from being able to focus solely on one candidate			1
a perfect example was provided four years ago			0
republicans often complain that candidate @entity62 was not properly vetted by the media during the 2008 campaign			1
until june of that year , however , @entity62 was only part of the story			0
in the days leading up to the 2008 @entity28 primary , the public 's attention was riveted not on @entity62 and his qualifications for the presidency , but on his rival @entity84 tearing up at a campaign appearance in @entity87			1
@entity62 also benefited from the media 's fascination with @entity90			2
one can even argue that conservative radio talk show host @entity93 's " operation chaos " campaign , in which he encouraged listeners to vote for @entity84 to lengthen the @entity97 primary fight , actually benefited @entity62			0
it may seem surprising that @entity10 's dealings at @entity101 only recently became a campaign issue			1
after all , he has been an official candidate for president since june			0
but @entity10 has been protected not only by all the primary opponents , but also by volatile polls			1
one after another , a challenger has soared up in popularity			0
@entity10 was the presumed front - runner from @entity110 , so when someone else appeared to be competitive , it became a story			1
then , of course , came the media scrutiny of each of these challengers			2
the result : stories about @entity121 's church ; @entity2 's decision to support mandated gardasil vaccines ; allegations of sexual harassment on the part of @entity127 ; @entity8 's work for @entity129 and @entity130 ; and @entity9 's views on contraception			0
it is not that @entity10 was ignored , but he was forced to share the spotlight			1
every candidate has some weakness			0
the success of a campaign will often depend upon how well a candidate is able to deflect attacks			0
although primary opponents are likely to point out these flaws , their criticism is usually more muted than that from another party			2
and the longer a candidate can avoid being attacked full on , the better			2
@entity4 candidates are scuffling among themselves , but they all want @entity62 out of the @entity149			0
whether they are on the campaign trail or in a debate , none misses an opportunity to go after @entity62			0
@entity62 is in the position of a dazed boxer			0
he keeps getting punched but has four opponents he needs to hit back			2
the longer the @entity4 primary goes on , the longer each candidate avoids suffering too many direct and powerful blows			2
although i doubt that the @entity10 campaign staff would agree , in the end , a @entity161 victory in @entity6 might be the best thing that can happen to him			1
join @entity166 on @entity167 and follow updates on @entity169			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			1

@entity172 : if @entity10 wins in @entity6 , the " bandwagon effect " sets off winning streak
but that means a longer time for @entity10 to be the sole focus of attention , @entity172 says
@entity172 says the media and opponents can zero in on his weaknesses without distraction
