-- call it good timing , divine intervention or just dumb luck			0
what started out as a wee - hours traffic stop wound up catapulting a 30 - year - old @entity8 real estate attorney and reserve sheriff 's deputy into an unfamiliar -- and uncomfortable -- role : that of hero			1
it was @entity13 who put the cuffs on @entity16 , a 24 - year - old @entity20 national whom @entity22 @entity21 called " perhaps ... the most dangerous arsonist in the county of @entity19 that i can recall			1
" @entity16 is suspected of setting a rash of car and building fires across the city			2
following his arrest , no more suspicious fires were documented in @entity19 , authorities said			1
@entity13 was working his $ 1 - per - year job as a reserve deputy with the @entity22 early january 2			1
normally a part - time deputy , the @entity34 , @entity35 , native had been working full time for four days as a spate of arson fires -- more than 50 in all -- had @entity38 on alert			1
" you just got the sense that everyone in the city was on edge , rightfully so , because of what was happening , " @entity13 told reporters			1
he recalled " seeing residents flee from their homes and basically run for their lives			0
" armed with a description of a possible suspect and vehicle gleaned from a surveillance video released by police , @entity13 pulled over a van and shone a spotlight inside			1
the man he saw fit the description -- a white male adult with a short ponytail and a receding hairline			0
" that was very distinct information about a person , " @entity13 said			1
the sighting " was a big key			0
" at the same time , two @entity19 police officers , seeing @entity13 put on his flashing lights to initiate the traffic stop , pulled in behind him			1
questions remain about how much @entity13 knew about the man in the van when he pulled him over			1
the @entity73 said its agents recognized @entity16 on the surveillance video from a separate investigation and shared their knowledge with @entity19 authorities			1
@entity13 and the sheriff 's department have stayed mum on that aspect			1
asked why he pulled the van over , @entity13 flashed a boyish grin and said only , " information that we had on him ... on the vehicle he was driving			2
there was a good deal of information being circulated			0
" but it was @entity13 who was thrust into the spotlight			1
questioned by reporters hungry for more about him , he deftly deflected questions about himself and his personal life , choosing to praise the deputies at the sheriff 's @entity98 station			2
" as a reserve deputy , i 've seen what they do , and i 've sat next to them in the car shift after shift after shift , and i have tremendous respect for what they do , " he said			1
" they take the reserve program extremely seriously , and they treat us as one of them when we 're in the car			2
" he declined to talk about any statements @entity16 may have made at the time , as well as his own emotional state			0
@entity13 responded politely to an e-mail request for an interview but referred questions to the sheriff 's department			2
he signed the e-mail , " warmly , @entity126			0
" " he is very humble			0
he 's a good kid , " said sheriff 's capt. @entity127 , who heads the department 's @entity128			0
he said @entity13 's reticence to accept accolades and his insistence on sharing credit with other officers may be part of the culture -- especially among the reserves			1
" part of being a reserve is striking that balance , because you 're not full time , " @entity127 said			2
@entity13 attended both @entity142 and the @entity143 , @entity21 said			2
he received his law degree at @entity143 , according to the @entity145 , which lists his law office as being on @entity147 in @entity148			0
he was admitted to the bar in 2008			0
" i 've been interested in both law and law enforcement for several years , and i think each influences the other , " he told reporters			0
after moving from @entity35 with his family , @entity13 grew up in @entity148 , said @entity156 , spokesman for the @entity22			2
@entity13 credits his family and upbringing with his desire to give back to the community , @entity156 said			2
" he really does just want to provide community service to @entity98 , " @entity156 said			0
while reserve deputies are required to work a minimum of 20 hours a month , @entity156 said @entity13 " loves it so much , he 's out once or twice a week in a patrol car			1
" @entity13 's younger brother @entity166 is also a reserve deputy and told reporters he now has " big shoes to fill			1
" " i 'll continue to strive to be as good of a brother and deputy as he is , " @entity169 said			2
the incident has focused attention on reserve deputies , a program used nationwide to provide support for sheriff 's departments			1
the @entity22 has 844 reserve deputies in a variety of settings , including mounted patrols on horseback , search and rescue teams , dive teams and helicopter pilots , @entity127 said			1
the reserve deputies undergo the same training as full - time deputies , except the classes are offered on nights and weekends rather than during the day , he said			1
and reserve deputies , with only a token salary , are subject to many of the same hazards as regular officers			1
a @entity197 page , " in memory of our @entity204 , " provides a lengthy list of reserve and auxiliary officers who died in the line of duty nationwide			2
when patrolling , @entity127 notes , " you never know what you 're rolling up on			0
" reserve deputies provided 175,000 hours to the sheriff 's department last year , @entity21 said			1
" that 's a tremendous resource for our department , " the sheriff said			0
" they 're a huge part of what we do			0
these are people that really step forward and literally at times put their life on the line for a dollar a year			0
" requirements for being a @entity226 reserve deputy include being a @entity228 citizen , passing a thorough background check , holding a high school diploma and being employed or a full - time student			1
they are much the same requirements as for regular police officers or sheriff 's deputies , @entity127 said			2
@entity13 became a level 1 reserve deputy -- meaning he could patrol alone -- in december after completing the requisite 1,064 hours of training , @entity156 said			1
@entity16 's arrest came during @entity13 's fourth solo patrol shift			1
" i think the beautiful thing about our program is it mirrors the full - time program exactly , " @entity13 told reporters			2
while the training is held at different times , " everything we do is the same			0
" " when reserve deputies are out on patrol , the public does n't know whether it 's a reserve deputy or a full - time deputy , " he said			1
" it makes no difference and rightfully so			0
the training does n't make any difference either			0
" in many instances , the reservists are unsung heroes because of their assistance in cases that are n't as high profile , @entity127 said			0
the search and rescue teams , for instance , " do some fabulous work , and they rescue people on a regular basis , " he said			0
" the public just knows it 's the sheriff 's department			0
... they 're involved in some very dangerous and technically demanding rescue work in the mountains			0
" about a month ago , a reserve team helped local authorities recover the bodies of people who had died in a mining accident , he said			0
@entity13 is " very humble , " @entity127 said			2
" he knows ... that there 's another 843 folks that are doing very similar work and doing great things			0
... in terms of the danger or the dedication and work ethic and everything else , there 's a lot of other people doing the same thing on a daily basis			0
