-- from a 2 - 0 defeat at @entity2 on november 6 , 1986 to a @entity4 coronation party through the streets of @entity6 on may 13			1
@entity8 's 26 - year reign at @entity9 has seen the club transformed from a sleeping giant to a relentless , trophy - winning juggernaut in both the football arena and the sports business world			1
following wednesday 's announcement that the @entity16 , the most successful coach in @entity18 football history , will end his @entity20 tenure , @entity0 marks seven moments which have defined @entity8 's career			1
sacked by @entity23 @entity8 's managerial career has been littered with glorious highs , but it has not been without its lows , none more so than in 1978 when @entity8 was in charge of @entity29 team @entity23			1
he oversaw a remarkable upturn in @entity23 's fortunes which saw the unheralded club win the second - tier of @entity29 football in 1977 with a squad which bore classic hallmarks of a @entity8 team , notably his faith in young players			1
that @entity23 side had an average age of just 19			2
but he was unceremoniously sacked by then @entity23 chairman @entity42 for what he described as " breaches of contract " relating to the manager 's decision to join @entity48			2
'' i regret the fact @entity53 did not stay longer at @entity23 and i regret the circumstances of his departure , but i still believe that the club had no alternative , " @entity42 told @entity29 newspaper the @entity50 in may 1999			2
" there were no grudges			2
i 've met him several times at football matches since then and our relationship is quite amicable			2
" @entity48 roll over @entity66 @entity8 was finally appointed as @entity48 manager in june 1978 and unprecedented success followed for the @entity29 club			1
he broke the duopoly of @entity71 and @entity72 , guiding @entity48 to three @entity74 titles in 1980 , 1984 and 1985			2
however , arguably @entity8 's finest moment with @entity48 was on the @entity77 stage			1
following a @entity79 triumph in 1982 , @entity48 qualified for the @entity80			2
@entity8 's team reached the final , with a 3 - 2 quarterfinal second - leg victory over @entity84 one of the many highlights of an impressive campaign			1
in the final , held in @entity89 on may 11 , 1983 , @entity48 faced @entity91 giants @entity66 , managed by the great @entity92			0
the match finished in a 1 - 1 draw after 90 minutes , before striker @entity95 scored the winner for @entity48 in extra-time			0
@entity99 's death one of the most poignant moments of @entity8 's career arrived just over a year before he was appointed to the @entity2 job			1
@entity8 was part of @entity99 's coaching staff with the @entity29 national team ahead of a crucial 1986 @entity107 qualifying match against @entity108 in @entity109			1
@entity110 needed a point to reach the tournament in @entity113 , which they duly acquired following a 1 - 1 draw			0
but the match was overshadowed when @entity99 , the first @entity117 coach to win the @entity80 with @entity72 in 1967 , collapsed after the final whistle			0
" i grabbed for him as he started to fall , " @entity8 recalled , when talking to the @entity119 in 2012			1
" the medics came out of the tunnel			0
i held him until he was helped inside			0
" when i left to speak to the press i saw @entity125 and he was crying			0
' i think he 's gone , ' @entity125 said			0
i could n't believe it			0
" when we filed on to the bus there were thousands standing outside and the quiet sadness of the atmosphere was unforgettable			0
the abiding memory is of a solemn silence			0
it was as if the king had died			0
" in football terms , the king had died			0
" @entity8 coached @entity110 at the 1986 @entity107 , but the team headed home after the first round following a group phase campaign which yielded just one point			1
after watching the pressures of football get the better of his mentor , it raises the question of whether @entity99 's death played a role in @entity8 's decision to bow out on his own terms			1
@entity154 redemption after a trophy - laden spell at @entity157 with @entity48 , @entity8 headed south to join @entity2 in 1986 , but his early days at @entity20 were a world away from the glorious success he enjoyed in the 1990s and 2000s			1
two seasons passed without a trophy and after eight league games without a win , it was suggested @entity8 would be sacked if @entity2 lost an @entity154 replay against @entity166 on january 7 1990			1
substitute @entity167 scored the winner to send @entity2 into the next round and , allegedly , save @entity8 's job			1
@entity8 went on to mastermind a 1 - 0 victory over @entity172 in an fa cup final replay after the first match finished 3 - 3 to secure the @entity16 's first trophy at @entity20			1
the silverware continued to flow , with an @entity4 title -- the club 's first in 26 years -- arriving in 1993			1
deja vu ? @entity8 's retirement was originally scheduled for 11 years ago			1
the @entity16 announced in 2001 that the forthcoming season would be his last , hoping his decision to break the news in advance would allow the club to make suitable succession plans			1
but it had the opposite effect and , by november 2001 , defending champions @entity2 sat ninth in the @entity4 table			1
by january 2002 , after an eight - match winning run , @entity2 had risen to the top of the table and the next month @entity8 reversed his decision to retire from the game by signing a new three - year contract at @entity20			1
the rest , as they say , is history			0
six further @entity18 titles have followed , along with an @entity154 triumph and the @entity200 in 2008			1
the @entity201 in addition to the trophies and the accolades , there have been plenty of spats , with numerous star players feeling the heat of @entity8 's infamous " hairdryer " treatment			1
notably when a " one in a million " flying boot caught @entity212 above the left eye , an incident which dominated the headlines like no other flare up between @entity8 and one of his charges			1
following a 2 - 0 @entity154 defeat to @entity219 in february 2003 , @entity8 launched a tirade at his star midfielder which , according to @entity212 's autobiography , went along the lines of " @entity212 , what about the second goal ? what were you doing ?			1
we told you about it before the game			0
the problem with you is you do n't let anyone talk to you			0
you do n't listen '			0
" i felt like i was being bullied in public , " explained @entity212 , who now plays for @entity234			0
" i was being backed into a corner for no other reason than spite			0
" @entity212 swore at @entity8 and bedlam ensued			1
" the boss took a step or two towards me , " @entity212 continued			0
" there was a boot on the floor			0
he swung his leg and kicked it			0
at me ? at the wall ? it could have been anywhere , he was that angry now			0
" i went for the gaffer			0
i do n't know if i 've ever lost control like that before			0
suddenly it was like some mad scene out of a gangster movie			0
" @entity212 's teammates held him back , but after the incident , the then @entity258 captain appeared with a medical dressing over the cut above his eye			0
" it was a freakish incident , " @entity8 reportedly said			1
" if i tried it 100 or a million times it could n't happen again			0
if i could i would have carried on playing ! " an increasingly tempestuous relationship between the two personalities came to an end on 1 july 2003 , when @entity212 left @entity9 to join @entity66			1
treble may 26 , 1999 , was a night which simultaneously defied belief and defined @entity8 's @entity9 reign			1
the league title had been wrapped up , beating @entity275 's @entity219 to the @entity4 title by just one point			2
goals from striker @entity280 and midfielder @entity281 secured a straight - forward 2 - 0 win over @entity283 in the final at @entity285			0
@entity8 's team were one step away from securing an unprecedented @entity4 , @entity154 and @entity200 treble			1
@entity2 's opponents in the @entity80 final at @entity293 's @entity292 stadium were @entity84 and the @entity294 looked set to win the showpiece match after @entity297 's first - half free - kick put them 1 - 0 ahead			2
in search of a way back into the match , @entity8 threw on substitutes @entity280 and @entity302			2
as the game ticked into extra-time , @entity2 earned a corner			2
goalkeeper @entity306 raced forward in a desperate attempt to force an equalizer			0
the initial cross was cleared , but the ball fell to @entity311 whose low shot from the edge of the box was turned into the net by @entity280			0
cue jubilant celebrations among @entity2 players , fans and coaching staff , but uncontained joy was to follow seconds later			2
@entity2 earned another corner kick in the final seconds of injury time			2
@entity280 flicked on @entity212 's cross at the near post and @entity302 flung his right leg at the header to send the ball flying into the back of the net			0
@entity84 were beaten , @entity2 had completed an historic treble			2
as @entity8 remarked to @entity332 after the incredible climax , " football , bloody hell			2

@entity8 will retire as @entity9 manager at the end of the season
the @entity16 has been in charge of the @entity20 club since 1986
@entity8 has led the club to 13 @entity4 titles and five @entity154 wins
