@entity1 's rover curiosity successfully carried out a highly challenging landing on @entity3 early monday , transmitting images back to @entity5 after traveling hundreds of millions of miles through space to explore the red planet			1
scientists praised the landing monday			2
" this is a stunning achievement			2
the engineering went flawlessly , " said @entity12 , who was the first @entity3 program director at @entity1 headquarters and is now a consulting professor at @entity15			1
the 10 science instruments aboard @entity18 are in " perfect health , " and testing and calibration are under way , @entity1 said monday			1
some rover team specialists are analyzing the data from the landing , while others are preparing @entity18 for exploring @entity27 , where it landed , @entity1 said			1
on its first full day on @entity3 , the rover is tasked with raising its high - gain antenna , enabling it to communicate directly with @entity5 at higher data rates			0
the primary method of transmitting data is through the orbiters , because that is more energy - efficient			0
when asked whether anything had gone wrong during the landing , @entity37 , a mission manager with @entity1 's @entity38 in @entity39 , said simply , " no. " " there 's a lot ahead of us , but so far we are just ecstatic about the performance of the vehicle , " she told reporters at an afternoon news conference			1
she said the rover will start sending weather data tuesday but some of the " exciting science " wo n't begin for about nine @entity3 days			0
" it does take time to check out the vehicle , " she said			2
social media sites were bubbling with posts from enthusiastic earthlings on monday			0
the rover even has its own @entity61 account , @ @entity62			0
it informs readers : " fyi , i aim to send bigger , color pictures from @entity3 later this week once i 've got my head up & @entity69 active @entity68 " meet a rover driver : his car is on @entity3 the $ 2.6 billion @entity18 made its dramatic arrival on @entity3 terrain in a spectacle popularly known as the " seven minutes of terror			1
" this jaw - dropping landing process , involving a sky crane and the world 's largest supersonic parachute , allowed the spacecraft carrying @entity18 to target the landing area that scientists had meticulously chosen			1
the mission control in the @entity38 burst into cheers as the rover touched down monday morning			1
team members hugged and high - fived one another as @entity18 beamed back the first pictures from the planet , while some shed tears			1
at the news conference , @entity1 showed off some of the initial images , including one of @entity96 , which rises 3.4 miles above the floor of the @entity27 , according to @entity1			1
" we can see more clearly these pebbles all over the ground , " said @entity98 , a deputy project scientist with the mission			0
" we can see that it is very flat			0
... there are no obstacles for driving [ the few miles from the landing site ] " to @entity96			0
scientists can not tell yet how easy it will be to scoop up the surface material , she said			0
" i think the science team has a lot of work to do to figure out how were these materials put there , " she said			0
" was water involved ? we do n't know yet			0
" president @entity118 weighed in on the historic moment			1
" the successful landing of @entity18 -- the most sophisticated roving laboratory ever to land on another planet -- marks an unprecedented feat of technology that will stand as a point of national pride far into the future , " @entity118 said in a statement congratulating the @entity1 employees who had worked on the project			1
the scientific community reacted with a mixture of elation and relief			0
" rationally i know it was supposed to work all along , but emotionally it always seemed completely crazy , " said @entity135 , assistant professor at @entity136 , who is affiliated with the science team of @entity18			1
" so to see all those steps being ticked off and actually working , it 's a huge relief			2
" the initial images the suv - size rover sent back to @entity5 were black and white and grainy , but one showed its wheel resting on the stony ground , and the vehicle 's shadow appeared in another			1
more space and science news from @entity152 @entity151 a camera on @entity1 's @entity154 captured an image of the 2,000 - pound rover with its parachute still attached as it made its way down toward @entity27			1
at that point , the rover was about two miles from the planet 's surface			2
the spacecraft had been traveling away from @entity5 since november 26 on a journey of about 352 million miles ( 567 million kilometers ) , according to @entity1			1
@entity18 , which will be controlled from the @entity38 , has a full suite of sophisticated tools for exploring @entity3			1
they include 17 cameras , a laser that can survey the composition of rocks from a distance and instruments that can analyze samples from soil or rocks			0
the aim of its work is " to assess whether @entity3 ever had an environment able to support small life forms , " @entity1 said			1
@entity18 's first stop was @entity27 , which may have once contained a lake			1
after at least a year , the rover will arrive at @entity96 , in the center of the crater			0
the rover will drive up the mountain examining layers of sediment			0
this process is like looking at a historical record because each layer represents an era of the planet 's history , scientists said			2
the phenomenon of sedimentary layers is remarkably similar to what is seen on @entity5 , in @entity39 's @entity200 or in @entity201 in @entity202 , said @entity203 , chief scientist of the @entity204			2
rocks and minerals found on @entity5 are different than on @entity3 , but the idea of a mountain made of layers is familiar to scientists			0
unlike on @entity5 , however , @entity3 has no plate tectonics , so the @entity3 layers are flat and not disrupted as they would be on @entity5			0
that also means that @entity96 was formed in a different way than how mountains are created on @entity5 -- no one knows how			0
images : exploring @entity3 in these layers , scientists are looking for organic molecules , which are necessary to create life			0
but even if @entity18 finds them , that 's not proof that life existed -- after all , these molecules are found in bus exhaust and meteorites , too , said @entity229 , part of the @entity204 science team			1
if there are n't any organics , that may suggest there 's something on the planet destroying these molecules , said @entity136 's @entity135			2
but if @entity18 detects them , @entity135 said , that might help scientists move from asking , " was @entity3 ever habitable ? " to " did @entity3 actually host life ? " @entity18 's mission is also significant in an era when @entity1 's budgets are shrinking and @entity245 is becoming more ambitious in its space exploration program			1
" i feel like it 's a signal that we have the capability to do big and exciting things in the future			2
" said @entity253 , assistant professor at @entity254 of @entity5 and @entity255			0
" you ca n't not be excited			0
" liquid water is not something scientists expect to be apparent on @entity3 because the planet is so cold and dry , @entity229 said			0
if the planet does harbor liquid water today , it would have to be deep below the surface , perhaps peeking out in a few special places , but not likely to be seen by @entity18 , @entity229 said			1
rover to search for clues to life on @entity3 it 's hard to know how long ago liquid water would have been there because there 's no mechanism to date the rocks that rovers find on @entity3 , @entity229 said			2
evidence from the spacecraft @entity1 has sent to @entity3 so far suggests that the " warm and wet " period on the planet lasted for the first billion years of the planet 's history			1
" in order to create life , you need both the right environmental conditions -- which include liquid water -- and you need the building blocks from which life is built , which includes organics , " @entity229 said			0
the @entity204 is a precursor mission to sharper technology that could do life detection , @entity203 said			2
there are n't specific molecules that scientists are looking for with @entity18			1
the attitude is : " @entity295 to an interesting place with good tools and find out what 's there , " @entity229 said			2
what do you think about the @entity3 mission ? go to @entity303 curiosity is supposed to last for two years on @entity3 , but it may operate longer -- after all , @entity305 , which arrived on @entity3 in 2004 , were each only supposed to last 90 @entity3 days			0
spirit stopped communicating with @entity1 in 2010 after getting stuck in sand , and @entity308 is still going			1
" you take what @entity3 gives you , " said @entity229 , also the lead scientist on the @entity305 , which includes @entity305			0
" if we knew what we were going to find , it would n't be this much fun			0

testing and calibration are under way , @entity1 says
president @entity118 hails " an unprecedented feat of technology "
@entity18 's first stop is @entity27 , which may have once contained a lake
