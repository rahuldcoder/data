@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a meeting friday with his @entity5 counterpart , @entity8 foreign secretary @entity7 sought to explain why @entity9 had not been consulted before a failed rescue attempt that resulted in the deaths thursday in @entity1 of two hostages -- an @entity5 and a @entity13			1
" mr. @entity7 made clear that there had been a limited opportunity to secure the release of the two hostages whose lives were in imminent and growing danger , " said a joint @entity8 - @entity5 statement issued by @entity8 's @entity15			1
" under these circumstances it was only possible to inform @entity5 once the operation was already getting under way			1
" the meeting between @entity27 and @entity5 foreign minister @entity28 took place at a foreign ministers meeting in @entity31			2
" mr. @entity33 expressed deep sorrow and disappointment over the tragic outcome of the operation and both ministers agreed on the urgency of sharing full information to facilitate the reconstruction and understanding of these events , " the statement said			0
@entity8 's failure to consult @entity9 before the failed rescue attempt was " inexplicable , " the @entity5 president said earlier friday			1
@entity5 said @entity8 did not inform it before the attempt , carried out in conjunction with @entity1 forces , to rescue @entity13 @entity49 and @entity5 national @entity50 , who were kidnapped last year			1
" a clarification on the political - diplomatic level is also needed , " @entity5 president @entity51 said			2
the kidnappers killed the men while the raid to free them was under way , according to @entity8 government sources briefed on the matter			1
@entity1 president @entity60 has said the men were killed before the joint forces could reach their hideout in the northern state of @entity65			1
a spokesman for @entity8 prime minister @entity67 told @entity8 's @entity68 the government notified @entity9 as " the operation was getting under way , " describing it as a " very fast - moving " situation			1
the @entity8 ambassador to @entity5 , @entity74 , spoke to @entity5 authorities in @entity9 on friday " on his own initiative to explain events , " the @entity15 said			1
@entity1 forces , with support from @entity8 , launched the operation after receiving credible information about the captives ' location , @entity67 said			1
@entity49 and @entity50 worked for the construction and civil engineering firm @entity85 , which is based in @entity86			0
a message on the company 's website friday read simply " in loving memory of @entity91			0
rip from all your friends at @entity94 " @entity49 , 28 , was from northwest @entity95 , the @entity15 said			0
@entity50 , 47 , and married with two teenage children , hailed from the northern @entity5 town of @entity99 , the @entity5 newspaper @entity96 reported			2
@entity60 blamed the kidnapping and killings on @entity102 , the militant @entity103 terror group responsible for dozens of attacks in @entity1 in the past two years			2
the circumstances behind the men 's deaths were unclear , but @entity60 said authorities detained the alleged captors			2
" perpetrators of the murderous act , who have all been arrested , will be made to face the full wrath of the law , " the president said in a statement on the government website			0
but a statement posted on a pro-jihad forum on which the militant group has been active in recent months denies any link			0
" the hostage - taking operation was not a @entity102 one , we have always claimed responsibilities for our attacks , beware allowing the @entity127 [ infidel ] government of @entity1 to mislead you , " it says			2
in december , a @entity1 group calling itself " @entity132 in the land beyond the @entity134 " announced that it had captured @entity49 , according to the @entity68 in @entity8			1
@entity67 said he had worked to free the two men since they were kidnapped in may 2011 and authorized the rescue attempt			0
authorities could not find the men for months , he said , but eventually got credible information about their location , and " a window of opportunity " presented itself			0
" the terrorists holding the two hostages made very clear threats to take their lives , including in a video that was posted on the @entity148 , '' @entity67 said			0
" @entity102 " translates from the local @entity150 language as " @entity152 education is forbidden			0
