-- in april 1964 , only a few months after president @entity3 was assassinated , his widow @entity1 wrote to @entity4 -- an old family friend of both the @entity6 and the @entity7 -- and gave a glimpse of the dark melancholy that shrouded her			1
@entity10 mentioned an @entity12 trip with her children , @entity14 and @entity15 , and expressed hope the holiday might renew her spirits			0
" i hope it will give me via fresh air some new energy -- as i just have had none lately & can not even touch the ever growing piles on my desk , " she wrote to @entity4			0
" but this spring maybe everything will be better -- love @entity10			0
" @entity1 's letters underline the behind - the - scenes role of @entity4 , who urged president @entity3 to bestow honorary @entity30 citizenship upon @entity31 at special 1963 @entity33 ceremony			1
but more importantly , the @entity35 correspondence provides further insight into the first lady 's relationship with @entity3 during their @entity39 years and the painful aftermath of her husband 's november 1963 killing			1
during the past decade , the private letters of @entity1 have slowly come to light			1
most were kept private for many years in archives , away from public scrutiny			1
as a result , history has been deprived of important , albeit disturbing , facts surrounding the assassination and its effect on those closest to @entity3 -- especially his widow , whose grief included suicidal thoughts expressed to a priest			1
to be sure , a generation of @entity30 admired @entity1 's extraordinary grace and courage during her husband 's funeral and were naturally protective of her privacy when she was alive			1
but a wealth of letters and other documents -- including an extensive oral history by mrs. @entity1 kept under wraps at the @entity69 until 2011 -- remained out of sight , well past her death in 1994 , leaving the historical record incomplete			1
now a half century later , it is time for all the @entity1 letters to be available for historians , allowing for a more full and accurate understanding about one of the most dramatic moments in 20th century @entity30 history			1
efforts by the @entity3 family to keep these letters at bay only mute our comprehension of what truly happened on that tragic day in @entity87 and the kind of psychological damage that gun violence can wreak on the lives of innocent survivors			1
the existence of @entity10 's letters was unknown to me until i stumbled upon some in preparing a 2003 book about how the @entity6 ' @entity99 immigrant background influenced their personal and public lives			1
during my research , three people suggested speaking with the rev. @entity103 , a @entity104 friend of @entity106 's family , though none apparently knew of @entity103 's involvement with @entity10			2
@entity103 surprisingly told me how he counseled a grief - stricken @entity10 for several months beginning in april 1964			0
he provided " tennis lessons " to @entity10 at @entity106 's @entity110 home while helping the widowed first lady through her agony and depression			2
@entity103 later allowed me to review his personal files at @entity117 's library			0
there i found several remarkable letters and documents about @entity1 's emotional struggles			1
she shared her doubts about @entity123 , fate , a heavenly afterlife with her slain husband , and her children 's immediate future			0
" do you think @entity123 would separate me from my husband if i killed myself ? " @entity10 asked the priest			2
" it is so hard to bear			0
i feel as though i am going out of my mind at times			0
would n't @entity123 understand that i just want to be with him ? " @entity117 later held a press conference about the " unique historical window " @entity103 's papers provided			2
but soon after a complaint from the @entity3 family , @entity117 access was closed to @entity10 's letters in @entity103 's files			1
similar letters , though , would turn up elsewhere			2
in may 2014 , a batch of 33 @entity10 letters to an @entity148 priest , the rev. @entity143 , whom she first met in the early 1950s , were headed for auction until the @entity6 objected to their disclosure			2
these letters , containing sentiments similar to those @entity10 confided to @entity103 , were published by various publications but were eventually returned to the @entity3 family , reportedly at the direction of @entity155 , her daughter			1
they are no longer public			2
more letters from @entity1 turned up in the files of @entity35 , made available in june 2011 at the @entity69			1
i describe them in my new book about the @entity7 and the @entity6			0
after @entity4 offered successful suggestions for @entity3 's 1961 inaugural celebration , @entity1 sought advice about @entity166 's social scene			1
her letter reflects the anxiety of a woman in her early 30s wanting to please her husband in her new role as first lady			2
" one thing i wish you could help me with , " @entity10 wrote in her fragmented longhand sentences to @entity4			0
" is it enough to just keep doing things in a private way -- as one would do if not president -- go to the theatres , symphonies , etc. and try to have the entertainment at the ( @entity39 ) be substantial -- ... but that is so little -- do you think we should have an enormous reception at the @entity187 for artists -- that seems rather treating them like freaks -- i try to work some into every state dinner -- but that 's a tiny drop in the bucket -- if you have a brainstorm do tell me			0
" @entity10 let @entity4 know how to send notes to her social secretary 's attention so that she 'd read them personally			2
" put your name on the letter and special -- ( my code for getting my own mail ! ) " she instructed			0
after @entity3 's assassination and the 1965 death of @entity31 , @entity4 remained in touch with both families			1
she later asked @entity10 and her second husband @entity207 to contribute to a book of remembrances about @entity31 's son , @entity210 , who died in 1968			0
" you know how @entity211 and @entity212 loved him -- but did you know how my son @entity15 loved him ? " @entity10 asked @entity4 about @entity210			0
around her children , @entity10 wrote , @entity210 " was completely himself -- and never changed gears for them			0
" in her essay for @entity4 's book , @entity10 recalled how @entity210 gave her son , @entity15 , a complete set of @entity31 's books -- including his masterful biography about @entity223 , a fabled @entity224 ancestor -- which she kept in the @entity6 ' @entity227 apartment in @entity228			0
" they are in the bookshelves in the dining room , beside @entity211 's @entity223 , which he read when he had scarlet fever as a boy , and the @entity31 books he had at @entity235 , " @entity10 recalled			0
uncertain of what her son 's future might bring , @entity10 told @entity4 that she hoped president @entity3 's heir might discover lessons about greatness from these bound volumes , just as other men had			1
" if , when he is older , he finds in them what his father found in them -- that would be this strange , touching legacy of @entity210 's , " @entity10 concluded			0
" @entity31 and @entity210 outlived @entity211 -- but maybe @entity210 will be the one to draw @entity15 to the books that shaped @entity15 's father			0
" documents like these are essential tools to gaining a clear and complete understanding our past			0
surely , both @entity3 and @entity1 , with their keen sense of history , would have understood .			1

@entity264 : @entity1 letters show emotions of young first lady , later *grieving* widow
@entity264 : she puzzled over social *protocols* as first lady ; pondered suicide when @entity3 killed
he says letters a crucial part of historical record , yet have been pulled back by @entity3 family
@entity264 : those that have been seen have been *revelatory* . they should be public
