@entity0 -- it was his breakout moment on the national political stage			1
" ( @entity12 ) here 's not a liberal @entity13 and a conservative @entity13 ; there 's the @entity13 , " a little - known @entity6 state senator named @entity7 declared as he gave the keynote address at the @entity9 in @entity10			1
" there 's not a black @entity13 and white @entity13 and @entity16 and @entity17 ; there 's the @entity13			2
" @entity7 's rousing speech helped to introduce him to @entity21 loyalists and lay the groundwork for his long - shot bid for the @entity24 in 2008			1
with both parties set to hold their conventions in the next few weeks , the political world will be watching to see who , if anyone , breaks out to become the next rising @entity21 or @entity30 star			1
drama is rare in modern conventions will it be the high profile @entity35 - @entity13 senator from @entity36 who was on @entity39 's vice presidential short list ? could the law professor - turned - consumer - rights - advocate - turned - senate - candidate in @entity41 break out ? and what about the young , @entity44 mayor of @entity45 or the senator from @entity47 who is the son of rep. @entity48 ? ' we need ( a ) @entity50 now because we 're in the desert ' @entity30 strategist @entity52 says the next breakout @entity30 star should be a speaker who focuses not so much on policy but on vision , conviction , leadership , an orientation toward the future , and the establishment of an emotional connection with the audience			1
in other words , the next big @entity30 star must have what pundits frequently call " the vision thing			1
" rare opportunity for speakers at @entity30 convention @entity52 , a @entity1 contributor who was also the chief media consultant for @entity39 's 2008 presidential campaign , says the @entity30 is longing for someone who can paint a vision of a brighter future built on @entity30 principles -- someone who , in @entity52 ' words , can compellingly deliver the message , " follow me			1
there 's a better place			2
" " we need ( a ) @entity50 now because we are in the desert , " the @entity30 strategist says			1
we do n't know where we 're going			0
" @entity30 sen. @entity86 of @entity36 : even though he already has a substantial national profile , @entity86 is the best bet to have an @entity7 - like performance at the @entity30 convention , @entity52 says			1
elected with support from the tea party movement , a @entity44 and a fluent @entity94 speaker , @entity86 is from an important battleground state and the son of immigrant parents			1

" he 's the future of the party , " @entity52 says			1
" i 'd keep an eye on him			0
... he 's the real thing			0
" sen. @entity107 of @entity47 : a fiscal conservative who is beloved by the tea party movement and the son of @entity48 , @entity107 also has potential to make a splash on the national stage , according to @entity52			1
in particular , the freshman senator appeals to conservatives and libertarians who want to shrink the size , scope and power of the federal government			0
sen. @entity121 of @entity122 : another tea party favorite from a battleground state , @entity121 was one of the few women believed to be on @entity39 's short list of vice presidential prospects			2
" she has tremendous potential , " @entity52 says , " she could be your dark horse			0
" congressional candidate @entity133 : @entity134 , @entity135 and fiscally conservative , @entity133 is an unlikely candidate to be the new face of the @entity30			1
but the mayor of @entity138 , @entity139 , is greatly loved by tea party activists and by conservative women			2
love is running to represent @entity139 's @entity143			0
if elected , she 'd be the first black @entity30 woman in @entity146 ' lower chamber			1
love is aware but resolute about her unique status in the @entity30			2
" there are a lot of people who have tried to define me as a person , " @entity133 , the daughter of @entity151 immigrants , told @entity1 in may			0
" i 'm not a victim , and i do n't allow anybody to put me in a box			0
" ' someone who can electrify the hall ' raw political talent is the first and most important criterion in picking a keynote speaker and doling out other prime - time speaking slots during a convention , according to @entity21 strategist @entity168			1
" you 're looking for someone who can electrify the hall and speak to the people back home , " says @entity168 , a @entity1 contributor			0
@entity168 also highlighted a speaker 's ability to address important themes			1
" i want someone who can stand up there and talk about the middle - class @entity184 and how that dream persists because of the @entity21 , " @entity168 says , adding that the november election could well be decided based on whom voters believe is doing the most to support the middle class			0
@entity21 @entity188 candidate @entity187 : the @entity21 @entity188 candidate in @entity41 would seem to be the perfect messenger to deliver her party 's message about tackling income inequality			2
" nobody fought harder for @entity198 reform , the reform that is now law and protecting consumers all across the country , than @entity187 , " @entity7 said after @entity194 introduced him at a june campaign event			2
" she has been a fierce advocate since before i knew her for the middle class , and she has been advocating on core issues that matter to families her entire career			0
" @entity168 says , " what she has is , i think , a very deep sense of how real people are affected by the economy			0
she 's not just talking about abstractions			0
" @entity45 mayor @entity210 : @entity210 has been tapped to give the keynote address at the @entity21 convention			2
although he is n't well - known nationally , fellow @entity213 says the mayor is known back in the @entity215			0
" everybody 's been talking about him for a while , " @entity168 says of @entity210 's reputation in @entity215			0
@entity210 is the first @entity44 to deliver the @entity21 keynote , according to convention organizers			2
@entity223 gov. @entity222 : before the recent @entity223 wildfires and the mass shooting in @entity228 , @entity223 , the state 's @entity21 governor was already one to watch			0
@entity222 is the highly regarded governor of a battleground state with a background as a small business owner			0
@entity223 governor : questions about @entity39 taxes ' almost visceral ' @entity235 attorney general @entity234 : @entity235 's chief law enforcement official is another one to watch , according to @entity168			0
