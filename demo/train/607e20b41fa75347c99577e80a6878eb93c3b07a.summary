purchasing managers ' index surveys released on monday indicated global manufacturing activity weakened slightly last month to the lowest level since june 2009 , when the world economy was emerging from recession			1
however , the fortunes of manufacturers diverged depending on their location : conditions deteriorated in @entity19 and the eurozone but picked up slightly in the @entity21 and @entity22			1
the @entity23 of global manufacturing fell slightly from 50.2 in august to 49.9 in september			1
@entity25 , chief economist at @entity26 , which compiles the @entity23 surveys , said : " generally , the conditions in global manufacturing are getting worse , with the eurozone seeing the steepest deterioration [ and ] increasing signs of weakness in @entity19 "			1
the surveys come as politicians and central bankers race to resolve the eurozone sovereign debt crisis amid fears that uncertainty about the region 's fate is hampering the global economic recovery			2
manufacturing activity in the @entity21 rose slightly faster than economists expected , according to the @entity45 survey , lifting hopes that the world 's biggest economy can avoid slipping back into recession			2
carmakers in the @entity21 reported strong sales for september , as consumers replaced old vehicles , credit conditions eased and the supply of @entity57 vehicles recovered			0
activity also rose slightly in the @entity22 , confounding economists ' expectations that the sector would shrink			2
in both the @entity21 and the @entity22 , rising production coincided with a drop in backlogs of work , which economists said suggested the pace of expansion might not be sustainable			2
in the eurozone , the manufacturing sector shrank for the second month in a row , with new orders falling at their fastest pace since june 2009			1
economists at @entity75 said this was " consistent with a deepening industrial recession "			0

@entity23 surveys in @entity19 showed a fourth successive monthly fall in activity in @entity87 , while manufacturing in @entity89 slowed to its weakest level for two and a half years			0
