the @entity0 needs to sit down			2
though it 's debatable how effective a punishment @entity3 's lifetime ban from the @entity4 will be -- considering that for the time being , he still owns and thus profits from the @entity7 -- the one voice that should not be involved in this discussion is that of the @entity0			1
not after news that the @entity12 chapter was prepared to bestow upon the disgraced @entity13 -- whose racist behavior has long been known -- a second lifetime achievement award next month			2
( the offer , not surprisingly , has been withdrawn			0
) on tuesday , after @entity4 commissioner @entity17 brought down punishment on @entity13 , the @entity0 added its voice to a joint statement with the @entity21 , the @entity22 and the @entity23 on @entity24 that said " @entity13 's long - established pattern of bigotry and racist comments have not been a secret in the @entity4 ... yet until now , they have been tolerated and met with a gentle hand and a blind eye			1
" say what ? tax records accessed on @entity34 , according to an article in the @entity36 , revealed that the @entity0 's @entity12 branch had been party to the sanitizing of @entity3 's legacy			1
how ? the group has received $ 45,000 from @entity3 's foundations , which , given the real - estate mogul 's net worth of nearly $ 2 billion , is peanuts			1
the phrase " sell out " is one that gets tossed around , but for some reason , it does n't quite cover the @entity0 's @entity49 chapter in this case			1
the first time @entity3 was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the group was in the midst of a lawsuit for housing discrimination based upon race			2
to decide to honor him with the award a second time , after he had paid millions to settle multiple discrimination suits , after learning that he allegedly said that " all the blacks in this building , they smell , they 're not clean " and " @entity64 ... just sit around and smoke and drink all day ... so we have to get them out of here , " is not selling out			2
selling out makes financial sense			0
no , considering what $ 45,000 means to a man of @entity3 's wealth , honoring him with awards is just giving integrity away			1
i understand that @entity3 has donated to other black groups and established a scholarships for black students at @entity78			0
and while that 's a positive , i also understand that such donations are tax - deductible and do not require him to actually be around black people			0
something , according to the now - infamous recordings , he is not a big fan of			0
at least not at his games			0
the @entity0 's willful blind spot is particularly disturbing when you consider the growing wealth gap between blacks and whites in this country and that the biggest factors in that gap are fair housing and education			0
how could an organization supposedly dedicated to the economic advancement of blacks honor someone the @entity100 said was working against its mission ? this curiosity is very similar to the @entity104 chapter of the @entity0 joining a lawsuit with the @entity106 in 2011 in an effort to squeeze out successful charter schools and protect failing traditional public schools			1
thousands of parents , many of them minorities , protested			0
as was the case with the @entity49 chapter , money reportedly was a factor in the @entity104 chapter 's allegiance			1
it 's fine for the national organization to characterize questionable decision - making by local chapters as anomalies , but it 's hard to view the goings - on in @entity104 and @entity12 , the two largest cities in the country , as just being local			0
no , instead of worrying about joining in the censure of @entity13 , the @entity0 -- which is currently searching for a new executive director -- should worry about itself			1
when the @entity0 held a funeral for the n - word in 2007 , it felt as if the organization had buried its relevance beside it			0
it did n't help that the person helping lead the ceremony was former @entity136 mayor / felon @entity134			0
in light of the crippling socioeconomic impact that housing discrimination has had on minorities in general and @entity12 in particular , for chapter president @entity141 to say " @entity143 teaches us to forgive " in the same interview monday in which he said " we are negotiating with him about giving more moneys to @entity149 students at @entity78 , " it sounds to me the @entity0 needs to take that finger it 's wagging at @entity17 and the @entity4 and point it back at themselves			1
@entity17 's working to clean up his house , but the @entity0 still looks dirty .			2

@entity155 : it 's *hypocrisy* for @entity0 to join groups in calling out @entity4 's former tolerance of @entity13
@entity161 's @entity49 chapter accepted money from him , was set to honor him for second time
@entity155 : abiding @entity3 's racism is n't selling out , it 's giving integrity away
@entity155 : @entity0 ca n't point finger at @entity4 for tolerating @entity13 ; it must get own house in order
