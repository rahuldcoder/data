@entity0 , senators ( @entity9 , @entity9 )			1
and that 's just the top tier			1
the bar has been set -- and it 's awfully low			1
and by the way , many of these men managed to crawl right under that bar and survive , even thrive			2
eventually , they found there was just one way out -- owning up to their own shortcomings			0
sure , it may have been due to legal pressure			0
but some discovered the public can be forgiving , especially if it believes you have something important to offer to the nation			0
just ask @entity9 , now serving as philanthropist to the world			1
so now comes @entity35 , accused of sexual harassment by four women			1
he calls the charges baseless and defends his integrity			0
his political campaign and supporters have gone into full damage - control mode , scrutinizing the women			0
all predictable -- and reflexive -- enough			0
but here 's the rub : @entity35 also tells us that the @entity47 investigated the charges against him and found them to be " baseless			1
" if he wants to get this behind him , how about getting the facts out ? give the association 's board permission to release the results of their internal investigation , if there was a formal inquiry			1
then , as they say , the truth will out			0
and there 's another plus : the partisans and the interest groups will have to start dealing with the facts			2
and the public can decide for itself			0
it 's not as if this predicament is new to us			2
recall back in the day when @entity9 was in the middle of the @entity72 mess			1
republicans were ( rightly ) outraged , demanding his resignation or impeachment			0
feminist groups , by and large , remained largely on the sidelines or supportive of @entity9 -- because he was , um , not a sexual harasser			1
oh , and yes , he was good on their issues			0
now the tables have turned			0
feminist groups are outraged by the charges against @entity35 and lots of @entity87 partisans are defending him , choosing to level their scrutiny on the women instead			1
( we 've come a long way , baby , in that some conservative women 's groups are criticizing @entity35 's i - do n't - recall defense			1
) conservative @entity1 contributor @entity96 sees the hypocrisy of those who raised the red flag about @entity9 , but not @entity35			1
" for we who led the charge against @entity9 on a number of related issues to continue to blame the media or other campaigns or say it simply does n't matter makes us the hypocrites as well , " he wrote on @entity1			1
he is , of course , right			0
and it is exactly what we are seeing , much of it from the @entity35 campaign itself			1
when declarations of innocence do not seem to be enough , there 's the change - the - subject tack : how about fingering a leaker , say from @entity121 's staff ? when that 's denied , back off			2
then take a turn , and start decrying " anonymous " charges			0
when the charges are on the record , take on the accuser			0
and when all else fails , blame the media			0
and the liberal " @entity131 machine			0
" ah , it takes me back to the days when @entity72 was whispered to be a " stalker " and @entity135 was taking on the " right wing conspiracy			0
" but here 's what we learned in that case : the fact that @entity72 inappropriately bared her underwear to the president did not excuse his behavior			2
and the fact that @entity135 was right about those who were " out to get " @entity9 does not mean he was in the clear			1
it 's just not that simple			2
the voters will figure it all out , as always			2
the bar may be set low for the politicians , but the public somehow manages to rise above it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			1

the litany of politicians behaving badly is a long one , says @entity156
many have survived , but the *verdict* is up to the voters , she says
she says @entity35 's best *strategy* would be to seek release of all the *details*
@entity156 : @entity9 was able to survive a damaging scandal
