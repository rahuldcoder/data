an eight - day search in @entity3 near where @entity4 went missing seven years ago has uncovered no new evidence , @entity1 police said wednesday			1
@entity8 's @entity7 -- also known as @entity9 -- are leading the hunt for @entity11 , who was a few weeks shy of her fourth birthday when she disappeared from her family 's holiday apartment @entity15 , on @entity3 's @entity17 coast , in 2007			1
@entity9 said its officers had been working alongside @entity3 police and experts to search specific areas in the resort town			1
they had searched some 60,000 square meters of ground , including drains and derelict buildings , in what was " the largest deployment " ever undertaken by @entity1 police overseas in a case of this type			2
" " the decision to search the ' horse shoe ' shaped piece of waste ground to the west of @entity15 and other sites was as a specific result of the @entity1 's investigation work to date , " police said in a statement wednesday			1
" forty - one ground anomalies were identified initially by both aerial survey and ground analysis which were then investigated fully , " they said			0
" at this time no evidence relating to @entity4 has been identified			2
however it has given us an essential understanding of the activity on and people that have used this piece of land			0
" @entity9 said there was still a " substantial amount of work yet to be completed " in its investigation , and that " more activity " was expected to begin shortly			0
" this recent work is part of ensuring that all lines of enquiry are progressed in a systematic manner and covers just the one hypothesis that she was killed and buried locally , " it said			0
@entity11 's parents , @entity66 and @entity67 , left the girl and her younger twin siblings asleep in the apartment on may 3 , 2007 , while they went for dinner with friends at a tapas restaurant nearby			2
her mother checked on the children about 10 p.m. and discovered her daughter missing			0
last week , sources told @entity78 that @entity1 police were working on the assumption that @entity11 was dead , while their @entity3 counterparts were working on the assumption that she was still alive and had been taken out of @entity3 by a @entity84 national who had been in the country for a short time			1
@entity9 's head of specialist crime and operations , assistant commissioner @entity87 , told media on may 22 there would be " specific police activity " in @entity3 in the coming weeks , relating to @entity11 's disappearance			1
" it should not be assumed that this substantial upcoming phase of work in @entity3 will immediately lead us to the answers that will explain what has happened , " he warned at the time			0
" what you will see is normal police activity you would expect in any such major investigation			0
" @entity87 also told media that @entity9 had made it clear to their @entity3 colleagues that they would not be giving operational updates , saying : " if media interfere with police work , that work will stop			2
" @entity9 reopened its investigation into @entity11 's disappearance in july 2013 after a two - year review of the original probe			1
@entity3 police reopened their investigation last october			1
at the time , @entity7 said the two police forces ' investigations would run in parallel			0
