-- a team of @entity3 scientists have produced the polymers used for everyday plastics through bioengineering , rather than through the use of fossil fuel - based chemicals			1
it is believed that the technique may now allow for the production of environmentally - friendly plastic that is biodegradable and low in toxicity			1
the research focused on @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , a bio-based polymer which holds the key to producing plastics through natural and renewable resources			1
polymers are molecules found in everyday life in the form of plastics and rubbers			2
" the polyesters and other polymers we use everyday are mostly derived from fossil oils made through the refinery or chemical process , " professor @entity26 , who lead the research , said in a press statement			1
" the idea of producing polymers from renewable biomass has attracted much attention due to the increasing concerns of environmental problems and the limited nature of fossil resources			2
@entity15 is considered a good alternative to petroleum - based plastics , as it is both biodegradable and has a low toxicity to humans			2
" until now @entity15 has been produced in a two - step fermentation and chemical process of polymerization , which is both complex and expensive			0
the team used a metabolically engineered strain of @entity53 and developed a one - stage process			0
" by developing a strategy which combines metabolic engineering and enzyme engineering , we 've developed an efficient bio-based one - step production process for @entity15 and its copolymers , " said @entity26			0
" this means that a developed e. coli strain is now capable of efficiently producing unnatural polymers , through a one - step fermentation process			0
" global warming and other environmental problems are urging us to develop sustainable processes based on renewable resources			0
" this new strategy should be generally useful for developing other engineered organisms capable of producing various unnatural polymers by direct fermentation from renewable resources			0
" the research team from @entity74 in @entity75 and the @entity3 chemical company @entity76 published their findings in the journal " @entity79 " .			1

@entity3 scientists develop a plastic not derived from fossil fuel chemicals
bio-based polymers make the plastics biodegradable and less toxic
