-- forty - four years ago , an @entity2 man stood on the @entity4 podium in @entity5 alongside two @entity7 athletes who , with their heads bowed , punched the air with gloved hands in a black power salute			2
the peaceful yet potent political protest at the @entity13 by 200 - meter medalists @entity14 and @entity16 became a symbol of the struggle for civil rights in @entity7			1
to their left in the photo stood silver medalist , @entity2 @entity24 , who stared straight ahead , his hands by his side , but who expressed his support for the pair by wearing an @entity32 badge			1
yet , on the list of famous @entity2 athletes , @entity24 barely rates a mention			1
far from elevating @entity24 to the status of hero in his home country , his family say he was shunned on his return to @entity2 and unfairly denied the opportunity to contest another @entity4 -- claims the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) denies			1
" in the @entity43 he 's hugely well known			0
but here in @entity2 , a lot of people are shocked when they find out that the white guy in the black power protest is an @entity2 , " his nephew , @entity44 , told @entity0			2
@entity24 , a filmmaker who describes himself a civil rights activist , turned his uncle 's @entity4 story into a film " salute " which was released in @entity2 four years ago and had a short run in cinemas during the @entity58 in the @entity7 and @entity59			1
@entity24 : the forgotten @entity61 hero he has turned the story into a film script called " 1968 " that aims to set the record straight using big name stars including @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , @entity24 said			2
it is hoped filming will begin next year			0
it was not " salute , " but a magazine article that alerted @entity2 federal lawmaker @entity75 to @entity24 's story and motivated him on monday to urge the country 's @entity77 to formally acknowledge @entity24 's achievements and extend him a posthumous national apology			1
the athlete suffered a heart attack and died in 2006 at the age of 64 , but his 91 - year - old mother , @entity84 , was in @entity77 to hear seven mps , including @entity75 , deliver impassioned speeches as to why @entity24 deserves a greater presence in modern @entity2 history			1
" it 's just one of those tales that i think ought to be better known , " @entity89 mp @entity75 told @entity0			0
" what really struck me about it , was that @entity95 , as an @entity2 , should have been brought up on @entity24 , but i was n't			1
" bronze medalist @entity16 told the @entity96 tuesday that there was " no one in the nation of @entity2 that should be honored , recognized , appreciated more than @entity24 for his humanitarian concerns , his character , his strength and his willingness to be a sacrificial lamb for justice			1
" during his speech , @entity75 told @entity77 : " after @entity16 forgot his gloves , @entity24 came up with the idea that the two @entity7 should share the one pair of gloves			1
a protest like this , on a global stage , had never been done before			0
" at the time , it was electrifying			0
racist slurs were hurled at @entity14 and @entity16			0
@entity118 president @entity117 -- a man who 'd had no difficulty with the @entity121 salute being used in the @entity122 -- insisted the two be expelled in that moment @entity24 advanced international awareness for racial equality			2
" however , what happened after @entity24 returned home to @entity2 is less clear			2
more than 40 years after that " electrifying " event , divergent accounts have emerged about whether @entity24 's political stance denied him future @entity4 glory			1
@entity24 's family insists he was deliberately excluded from the @entity2 @entity4 team sent to the @entity133 in 1972 , despite repeatedly qualifying			1
" he qualified for both the 100 and 200 meters for the @entity133 but just was n't selected			0
i guess that could be considered as a ban but he was pretty disappointed by that , " @entity24 's brother , @entity135 , told the @entity136 ( @entity96 )			1
the @entity42 says @entity24 failed to qualify for the @entity133 after finishing third in the 200 - meter sprint at the @entity142 in march 1972			2
the body 's media director also denied any suggestions that @entity24 was " blacklisted " for supporting @entity14 and @entity16 ' podium protest			1
" there was no punishment dealt out to @entity24 following the 1968 incident with black power salute			2
he was n't even reprimanded by the @entity42 at the time , " @entity151 told @entity0			2
" he was given , what has been written in a book by historians , as a gentle caution and then he was given some tickets to a hockey game so he could go and watch his teammates play hockey and that was the sum total of his punishment , " he added			0
asked whether the @entity42 would support a formal apology to @entity24 from the @entity77 , @entity151 said : " we 're a little bit baffled by this debate			1
we never had an issue with @entity24			2
he never had an issue with us			0
" there was never any suggestion that he was ostracized or not happy with the aoc			0
we 've got nothing to apologize for because we 've never wronged @entity24			1
" @entity24 's family says that the @entity173 was also snubbed during the @entity174 in @entity175 by not being invited to be part of the official opening or closing ceremonies			1
the @entity42 said no former athletes were invited and that @entity24 was offered tickets to buy to attend , like any other former @entity2 olympian , as the cost " would have been astronomical " to host them all			1
" the aoc is certainly right that they treated him like every other former @entity173 , " @entity75 said			2
" he was given the opportunity to purchase tickets			0
they could have done so for hundreds of people who have ever competed for @entity2 in the @entity4			2
but i do think he 's pretty special			0
not just because he 's pretty much the only white guy to win a sprint medal in the last generation			0
but just that amazing stance that he took in 1968 , being on the right side of history when so many others were on the wrong side			0
" aside from his political statement , @entity24 has for 44 years retained the @entity2 record set for the 200 - meter sprint during the @entity197			1
asked whether , aside from the apology , the @entity42 would support @entity24 's recognition for his achievements on the track , @entity151 evoked another great and arguably better - known @entity2 olympian , distance runner @entity202			1
" there 's people like @entity202 who won gold medals in 1960			0
we 're not acknowledging @entity202 ... so why do we have to acknowledge that @entity24 might hold a 200 - meter record ? there are lots of champions out there who have done equally as well or better than @entity24			0
" @entity151 also said that the debate in @entity77 was " irrelevant " given the progress made in civil rights since the @entity197			0
" the politicians from both sides need to look and check on who is the @entity7 president , at present			0
and i think the whole world has moved on since 1968			0
so on that score , really , their debate is irrelevant , " he said			0
the @entity2 parliament has yet to issue a formal apology or recognition for @entity24			1
while the motion was debated , an official vote still needs to be scheduled for a later date			0
