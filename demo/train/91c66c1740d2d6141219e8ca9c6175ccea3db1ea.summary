-- the last time @entity2 beat @entity3 , the @entity4 was just 17			1
it was the final of the 2004 @entity6 , and the victory capped her breakthrough year after an attention - grabbing first grand slam title at @entity11			1
fast forward eight years , and history is repeating as the two biggest names in women 's tennis meet again in sunday 's climax to the season - ending championships in @entity18			2
neither ended 2004 ranked as no. 1 , and the same will be the case this time			1
@entity2 overpowered @entity23 6 - 4 6 - 2 in the second of saturday 's semifinals , but the @entity26 had already guaranteed the year - end top spot by winning two of her group games			1
however , it was a measure of revenge for the second - ranked @entity4 , who lost to @entity23 in january 's @entity34 final , the @entity36 semifinals and in two other tournament title matches -- the most recent in @entity38 earlier this month			1
" when you find yourself in a losing position a few times during the year , you want to try to figure out how to change those things around , " @entity2 said			2
" i certainly did n't make as many mistakes today as i did in our previous matches this year			0
" i 'd lost to @entity45 the last few times , so i 'm really happy i put myself in the semifinals to play against her and try to improve that -- i was hoping to have a better result , and i 'm happy i did today			2
" while she ended her losing run against @entity23 , @entity2 must now break a streak of eight successive defeats against @entity3 -- who thrashed her in august 's @entity55 final			1
the @entity56 , who won the @entity6 event in 2001 and 2009 , reached the final for the fifth time with a 6 - 2 6 - 1 demolition of fourth - ranked @entity62 in a rematch of july 's @entity11 final			1
the @entity65 had been on court for three and a half hours in winning her final group match on friday , and it showed as @entity36 champion @entity3 -- who had a rest day -- needed just 61 minutes to complete victory			1
" those last two matches really killed me , " @entity62 said			2
" especially that i did n't have the day off , and especially that surface -- it 's very sticky , so three and a half hours is a lot			0
" i really tried today and i really wanted to run , but my legs just did n't			0
this is the kind of tournament where you have to be fit every match to win			0
" i was trying , but @entity3 played too fast			2
i could n't do anything			0
" @entity3 , playing her first tournament since claiming her 15th grand slam title in @entity84 , has now won 17 matches in a row against top - five players and has lost just twice in her last 49 matches			1
" i probably had an idea she was tired , " the 31 - year - old			0
" i just told her that it was awesome she played so well and played through another match , after playing a good eight hours			0
it was really inspiring for me			0
" @entity23 was last year 's runner - up but her hopes of reaching another final were seemingly hampered by an injury that left her in tears at times during the second set			1
she is 62 - 0 this year in matches where she has won the first set , but @entity2 improved her record in such circumstances to 51 - 1			1
" i 'm not going to say i was the freshest today , but i also do n't want to make any excuses , " @entity23 said			2
" i think @entity62 felt much worse than me today			2
i saw her before the match and we looked at each other and we laughed really hard			0
" while @entity23 has just one grand slam to her name , she won five other tournaments this year , reached three more finals , claimed bronze at @entity116 and was ranked no. 1 for all but four weeks			1
" i 'm really proud of what i 've done the whole year , " the 23 - year - old said			0
" i started the year with @entity120 and i finished with @entity121 , which in numbers does n't seem like a huge jump , but we all know in reality it 's a pretty big difference			0
" i finished the year a much more mature person			0
i 'm very proud of that too			0
the whole year was a lot of learning experience , trying new things and taking the whole journey with the good and a few bads -- i did n't have many			0
i can not complain about this year			0
" meanwhile , @entity133 reached the final of his home @entity136 event for the ninth time with a 7 - 5 6 - 4 win over @entity141 's @entity140 on saturday			1
the world no. 1 is now level with @entity143 on 875 career wins , leaving them equal fourth			1
if he beats his 2009 @entity36 final conqueror @entity148 on sunday to win the @entity150 hard - court tournament for the sixth time , the 31 - year - old will match @entity152 on 77 top - level titles .			2

@entity2 sets up final clash with @entity3 at @entity6

@entity2 defeats world no. 1 @entity23 in saturday 's second semifinal
