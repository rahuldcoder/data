-- @entity1 was proud to be a traitor			2
in a way , he was among the most dangerous of @entity5 terrorists			2
by turning his back on the country he grew up in , he gained credibility and coupled that with his intimate knowledge of western culture to become a driving force behind a powerful @entity5 propaganda machine			1
the one - time @entity14 resident , who @entity16 and @entity17 officials say was killed with @entity19 cleric @entity18 in a drone strike friday morning , used his knowledge of computers to help produce a glossy , @entity24 - style magazine called @entity25 that touted the edicts of @entity27 , or @entity27			1
just what motivates a man who has spent much of his life growing up in the @entity16 to wage jihad against it ? many of the answers are provided by @entity1 himself in an article he penned for @entity25 titled , " i am proud to be a traitor to @entity16			1
" in the article , @entity1 details his journey from @entity14 to @entity17 , writing that " @entity41 's imperialism " was something he could no longer tolerate			1
" what they have done and continue to do in the @entity19 lands is what i felt , totally unacceptable to my religion			0
" he details how he relied on his @entity16 right to free speech to become more vocal about his anger toward @entity16 foreign policies			2
he also writes that he was aware he was being watched by the @entity50 , something that played a role in his decision to flee			0
( a senior law enforcement official tells @entity0 @entity1 was being investigated by the @entity50 office in @entity14 , which determined it did n't have enough evidence to seek an indictment against him			0
) " i decided to take up the pen and write out my thoughts and feelings regarding @entity16 's cowboy behavior in the @entity63 lands " wrote @entity1			1
" i knew that i had to stay under the guidelines of the laws regarding freedom of speech , but at the same time , i knew the real truth would n't be able to reach the masses unless and until i was above the law			0
" @entity1 fled to @entity17 in 2009 and intelligence officials believe it was soon afterward that he became the editor of @entity25			1
the official explanation of @entity1 's presence in @entity17 was that he had gone to " teach @entity75 , " which had become code in intelligence circles for attending radicalization classes			1
the publication of the magazine was also concerning to intelligence officials as it became a significant tool in @entity27 's recruiting effort and a signified a dangerous shift by providing the know - how for sympathizers to carry out attacks			1
" the primary focus of the magazine is to inspire individuals to not just fly to @entity17 and join the group , but rather to provide them with the inspiration , the ideological framework , the targeting philosophy and the practical mechanics of building a bomb or conducting a shooting , " said @entity88 , ceo of @entity89 , a private company that provides intelligence analysis to governments			2
" to do it all , without ever having to step foot in a training camp but never having to come in physical contact with a terrorist , " @entity88 said			0
" and this allows @entity27 to not only conduct attacks against the @entity16 , but at no cost financially or in terms of security to the group , they are able to add this force multiplier to their operations , because if even one person follows the direction of the magazine , that 's a great success			1
" the deaths of both @entity18 and @entity1 are believed to be a significant blow to the future of the magazine			1
clearly , @entity27 understood its value			0
in a recently released supplement to inspire marking the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , @entity1 identified an @entity27 leader , @entity128 , as saying , " the media work is half of the jihad			1
" he also quotes someone he describes as a " brother " as saying , " a powerful media production is as hard - hitting as an operation in @entity16			2
" it 's a significance not lost on intelligence professionals , who see @entity1 's death as a " two - fer , " with @entity18 being the primary target			1
" @entity1 is unique in the sense that like @entity18 , he spoke @entity75 and had an appeal to the @entity24 mind			1
he knew how to write and had the technical ability to use the @entity146 , " said former @entity16 national security adviser @entity143 , now a @entity0 contributor			0
@entity0 terrorism analyst @entity147 added , " the fact that the editor of the magazine ( @entity1 ) has also been killed is a problem for @entity27 , particularly as it relates to their @entity24 recruitment effort , because the two people who principally spoke to the western world are now dead			1
" @entity143 suggests intelligence officials will be looking closely at those who are willing to step up and fill the role -- that is , if @entity27 can find anyone with the same command of the language and computer skills to do it			2
" that will be a strong indicator of how resilient the organization is , " she said			0
" over time , replacements tend to be less experienced			0
" in @entity168 , @entity14 , @entity1 family friend @entity167 told @entity0 that @entity1 's father did not agree with his son 's views			0
" his father is feeling a number of emotions , not just today , but over the past few years , " @entity167 said			0
" emotions such as embarrassment , frustration and heavy sadness , because it was his son			0
regardless of the disagreements that he had , it was his flesh and blood			0
" @entity167 , who runs an @entity63 center where @entity1 had occasionally prayed , expressed disappointment that the @entity16 government opted to kill @entity16 citizens who were not themselves known to be violent rather than capturing and trying them			2
" that is the @entity16 way -- or should be the @entity16 way			0
" @entity0 's @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 contributed to this report			0
