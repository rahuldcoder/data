@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , the @entity1 opposition leader and symbol of anti-government fervor , lashed out against @entity1 authorities on tuesday , saying remnants of the " tyranny " and " dictatorship " that prevailed under the toppled @entity10 of @entity1 's regime persist today			1
" in the early years of the @entity13 , most people were convinced that the structure of the revolution would destroy the past political situation of tyranny and dictatorship , and i was one of them who believed that , " said @entity3 , a former prime minister			1
but now , he said , he no longer believes that			0
" the current political situation in @entity1 indicates the presence of the remaining roots of tyranny and dictatorship of the @entity10 , " whose regime was overthrown in 1979 and replaced by an @entity29 republic led by @entity30			1
" i do n't believe that the revolution achieved its goals , " said @entity3 , speaking out forcefully as the tensions over @entity1 politics continue			1
the regime is marking the anniversary of the shah 's overthrow with a series of events that began this week and culminate on february 11			1
@entity3 and @entity41 , another @entity1 opposition leader , have urged supporters to demonstrate			1
those celebrations coincide with @entity1 trials and executions of street protesters who demonstrate against the june 12 presidential election victory of incumbent @entity48			1
in the final results @entity48 was declared the winner over @entity3 , a result seen by many @entity1 as questionable or rigged			1
the initial protests broke out last summer and have persisted			2
in late december , at least seven people were killed and hundreds arrested , witnesses said , as they took to the streets on @entity57 , a @entity29 holy day which occurred on december 27			0
@entity3 's nephew was among those killed during those protests			1
the @entity1 government has denied that its security forces killed anyone and has blamed reformists for the violence			1
police have arrested 4,000 people in the post-election crackdown			0
@entity3 , who made his web site comments in a question and answer format , said an @entity1 government that reflects " dictatorship in the name of religion is the worst kind " and he added he has lost hope " that the revolution had removed all those structures which could lead to totalitarianism and dictatorship			1
" " the most evident manifestation of a continued tyrannical attitude is the abuse of parliament and judiciary			0
we have completely lost hope in the judiciary , " he said			0
" stifling the media , filling the prisons and brutally killing people who peacefully demand their rights in the streets indicate the roots of tyranny and dictatorship remain from the monarchist era			2
" the semi-official @entity101 news agency reported tuesday that @entity1 will soon execute nine more people in connection with the country 's post-election riots			1
the nine are among 11 who were sentenced to death by @entity0 's @entity109 last month			0
@entity1 vows to execute protesters two were hanged last week , and a senior judiciary official was quoted as saying " the two people who were executed as well as the other nine who will soon be executed had certainly been arrested during the recent riots			2
" each had belonged to an anti-revolutionary group , had aspired to sow dissent and to uproot the regime , " the official said			0
@entity3 also praised the grass - roots @entity121 opposition movement			1
but he said while protesters should vent their opinions , they should follow law and not overstep legal bounds			0
any law - breaking would hurt the reform movement , he said			0
" the ultimate goal is to move toward an independent , free and united @entity1			2
women and men of all cultures , classes and ideas should have opportunities , " he said			0
" the green movement stands for human dignity , open ideas , diversity and freedom of expression			0
" @entity3 has n't been arrested since the protests began , but he is facing the wrath of an establishment targeting reformers like him			2
at the same time the regime is risking even further civil unrest if it takes him into custody			0
recently , @entity1 's parliament asked authorities to arrest " the main instigators and directors " of violent anti-government protests , the state - run @entity149 reported wednesday , the same day massive pro-government rallies were held in @entity0 and other cities			1
legislator @entity158 named three people he said " must be arrested " -- @entity3 , @entity41 , and @entity160 , daughter of the former reformist president , ayatollah @entity161			2
" they must not remain on the sidelines and be safe , " @entity158 said			0
" those who issue statements and invite people to create chaos in the streets and attack one another must be dealt with according to @entity29 laws			0
" pro-government crowds demonstrating in @entity0 have chanted " @entity172 , " " @entity173 to @entity174 , " and " death to @entity3			2
" noting the pressure and threats in the highly - charged political environment , @entity3 has said on his @entity180 page that he is ready for " martyrdom			2
" @entity2 's @entity182 contributed to this report .			0
