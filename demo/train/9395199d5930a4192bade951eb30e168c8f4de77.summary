" there is nothing serious here , " he said			2
" these are just young people fighting each other			2

" large crowds showed up for a funeral as well in the @entity32 capital , where 26 - year - old @entity107 was laid to rest			1
@entity32 authorities said @entity107 belonged to the pro-government @entity111 militia and was shot to death by the outlawed @entity113			2

" it 's a sovereign state , and @entity153 has in its own hands its destiny			0
" the end of @entity158 's 23 - year rule inspired @entity19 , and then others , to rise up for their rights			0
