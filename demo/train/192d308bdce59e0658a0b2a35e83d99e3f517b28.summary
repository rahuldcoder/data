-- as a former @entity3 officer , keen angler and the @entity6 's heir apparent , it makes sense that prince @entity8 would be inclined to worry about the future of fish and chips			1
britons have been eating the iconic national dish since the mid- 19th century , but with around 30 % of the world 's fish stocks thought to be over-exploited , the @entity8 has concerns			1
" when i was at school here in @entity22 , i remember one occasion buying fish and chips from a shop in @entity26 , " he told an audience of scientists and fisheries executives at the sixth @entity19			2
" it never occurred to me then that i was eating food that had such a reliance on how we treat a wild natural resource			0
but , of course , how we harvest the fish has a direct impact on how many are left to catch next time			0
" study : organic yields 25 % lower than conventional farming in 2010 , prince @entity8 launched the @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , a charity focused on monitoring and facilitating consensus on environmental management issues			0
drawing on the @entity40 's latest research , the @entity8 noted that sustainable fisheries tend to have three things in common : " a strong economic rationale " for their efforts , " a robust management structure " under which rules are enforced , and a holistic approach that takes into account " the whole ecosystem , rather than individual stocks in isolation			2
" " i am particularly encouraged to hear that the cod stocks in the @entity58 have shown signs of recovery from what was , only a decade ago , a much depleted fishery , " he said			0
" by reducing the effort at sea and other management techniques , the stock , i am told , has doubled over the past six years			0
" watch : keeping fish on the menu prince @entity8 also met with members of the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) , winners of this year 's @entity72 of the @entity74 competition , and fisheries executives gathered aboard a @entity22 marine research vessel moored in @entity78 's harbor to fry some sustainably sourced @entity22 haddock , and discuss how to safeguard the future of a beloved national dish			1
@entity6 eat fish and chips twice as much as any other takeaway meal , with 382 million meals consumed a year , according to @entity86 , general secretary of the @entity70			1
collectively , @entity6 's 10,500 fish and chip shops use 10 % of the @entity6 's potato crop and buys 30 % of its white fish , generating a turnover of $ 1.9 billion			1
" many businesses are family owned independents , some second and third generation or more , and are the focal point of many communities , " @entity86 says			0
" fish and chips have been firmly on the menu for 150 years and we 'd like it to continue for at least another 150 years " beauty trumps beast in conservation efforts although , @entity86 says 90 % of @entity6 's fish and chip shops " use frozen at sea fillets caught by large modern trawlers in well - managed waters			1
" with input from @entity110 , and from sustainability award - winning fish and chip shop owners , the @entity70 , which turns 100 next year , intends to draw up a @entity113 to ensure that fish and chip shops are selling fish from sustainable fisheries			0
it will also work with the @entity118 , which certifies sustainable seafood , to make it easier for fish and chip shops to gain @entity122 certification , so consumers can eat " conscience free " cod. @entity6 concerned about the provenance of the fish they 're eating can consult the @entity129 's newly revised @entity128 , which confirms that @entity22 @entity58 haddock , farmed organically or caught from sustainable or certified fisheries , is amongst the best choice they can make .			2

the @entity8 is concerned about sustaining stocks of fish , used in @entity6 's favorite meal .
@entity6 eat fish and chips twice as much as any other takeaway dish .
*industry* reps plan to *introduce* a code to ensure fish is *responsibly* sourced .
