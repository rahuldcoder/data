@entity0 -- a needle is inside the body of @entity5 laureate @entity4 , traveling along his veins and poking at his organs			1
this piercing imagery is used by the pro-democracy activist in his poem " june fourth in @entity15 " dedicated to the year 2009 -- the same year he was sentenced to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion of state power			1
prior to his arrest , @entity4 would write a poem every year around june 4 to commemorate the 1989 @entity19 crackdown in @entity20 and those who lost their lives			1
" he is really forcing himself to look at this in order that other people do n't forget , because it has been such a publicly erased moment in history in @entity30 , " says fellow poet @entity23 , who is based in the @entity24 @entity4 was a fervent participant of the 1989 pro-democracy movement			1
he occupied @entity19 , led hunger strikes , drafted public opinion polls and lobbied foreigners to donate toward the movement			2
on june 4 , 1989 , tanks entered the streets around @entity19 and opened fire on demonstrators			1
imprisonment two days after the crackdown , @entity4 was arrested and imprisoned for nearly 20 months			0
this was the first of many prison sentences that @entity4 would serve for speaking out against the @entity30 leadership			0
@entity4 is currently serving his sentence and could not be reached			2
it is unclear whether he is able to continue his annual tradition of composing a poem to remember those who died on june 4 , 1989			2
however , his works between 1990 and 2009 have been compiled into the anthology " @entity54 , " published in 2012			0
@entity23 translated the collection into @entity56			0
" june @entity60 in @entity15 " is the last entry in the collection and it particularly stands out for @entity23			1
" the very last poem in the collection is just heart breaking , " he says			0
the poem likens the tragic crackdown to a rusting but still piercing needle that has been left inside the activist 's body			0
" june 4 was a life - changing and defining date for @entity4			1
besides , he has been struggling with feelings of guilt as a survivor of the incident , " says @entity71 , founder of the rights group @entity72			0

translator @entity23 adds that : " the collection is an annual return to the same event , over and over again			0
