the @entity0 misled @entity1 and members of the media about how many veterans died or suffered serious harm as a result of extreme treatment delays , according to a new report by the department 's top watchdog			1
the @entity0 shared a fact sheet in april with @entity1 and the press that said 23 veterans died and a total of 76 suffered serious harm throughout the nation while waiting months or years for health care since 1999			1
but the report released monday by the @entity0 's @entity18 highlights multiple errors with these findings and a lack of evidence for statements the @entity0 released about them			1
amongst the misleading facts highlighted in the report , the @entity0 overstated the timeframe of its review by eight years , since the @entity0 said it examined unresolved requests for health care since 1999 , but in reality only examined requests dating back to 2007			2
moreover , the inspector general says there may have been " overstatements or understatements " about the number of deaths or illnesses resulting from delays at specific @entity0 hospitals and that the fact sheet contained a number of other errors			2
these errors also included an incident reported to have occurred at one @entity0 facility when it actually happened at another , and the number of " institutional disclosures " -- where the @entity0 admitted delays caused severe harm -- as being overstated at one facility			1
the report raises questions about how many veterans may have had their appointments erased by @entity0 staff before they received treatment			2
the @entity0 reported that between september 2012 and april 2014 , the number of appointments delayed more than 90 days dropped from 2 million to less than 300,000 , but the inspector general found that the @entity0 did not document how staff members were closing these appointments and did not ensure veterans received the care they were waiting for			0
as a result , the inspector general could not determine what happened to 1.7 million appointments			0
@entity0 leaders , including a top @entity0 health official , dr. @entity71 , shared many of these statistics on patient deaths and harm during a congressional staff briefing on april 7 and repeated them at a @entity77 hearing on april 9			0
rep. @entity78 , @entity79 , the committee chairman , described the errors as either intentionally deceitful or grossly incompetent			1
" @entity0 's statistics regarding the number of veterans harmed by department delays in care are almost certainly wildly inaccurate and we may never know the actual number of veterans affected by gaps in the @entity0 system that existed for years , " @entity78 said in a statement monday			1
" accountability for the @entity0 leaders responsible for misleading @entity1 and the public on this important matter is sorely needed , " he added			1
@entity78 also said the @entity0 eventually contradicted itself in correspondence with the @entity97 by saying a review of delayed requests for health care dating back to 1999 would not be possible			2
the @entity0 previously issued an apology for the misleading and incorrect statements saying , " @entity0 inadvertently caused confusion in its communication on this complex set of reviews that were ongoing at the time			0
for that , we apologize			0
there was no intent to mislead anyone with respect to the scope or findings of these reviews			0
" a separate @entity0 audit released in june found that about 57,000 newly enrolled veterans were waiting at least 90 days for medical care and that almost 64,000 who enrolled in the past decade requested , but never received , appointments			0
@entity0 secretary @entity122 has since taken steps to reform the embattled agency by creating new partnerships with private organizations , giving veterans greater access to private health care and establishing a @entity0 - wide customer service office , among other programs .			0
