-- my first visit to @entity3 was in 2005 when i was reporting for @entity5 's national television channel @entity4			1
as you can imagine , it was the realization of a lifelong dream			2
for the traveling circus of working media , there is an opportunity to place your name in a lottery , with the prize for the precious few who are chosen being a round at the course on the day after the @entity20 concludes			2
to get to play the course was always going to be a long shot , but i had decided to bring my clubs just in case			2
the draw is made on the saturday of the tournament			1
if you 're lucky to play , you are not allowed to enter the draw for another five years , so as to allow the fairest possible chance for those interested in teeing off on one of the world 's truly iconic courses			1
for a first - timer , it was something akin to an out - of - body experience when i was presented with an official invitation to play			1
i could not believe it ! the invitation is framed in our home alongside a @entity45 flag and a signed and marked scorecard			2
i was to tee off at 0730 , starting at the 10th tee			2
literally 15 hours after the leaders @entity51 and a certain @entity52 had graced the back nine in the tournament , so would i. up early , grooves cleaned and excited beyond belief , i pitched up at the gates of @entity57 and made my way up to the clubhouse to check in , meet my caddy @entity60 in his traditional white overalls and head to the practice range			1
i remember hitting a rocket off the tee with a hard draw and i still had a four iron to the green			2
the adrenaline , combined with a borderline hook , meant i bounced it over the back of the green into a bush			0
after a few rushed shots that confirmed my amateur status , a double bogey was recorded			0
we were off and running			0
@entity80 told , i enjoyed five double bogeys			0
and they were good doubles ! the greens were unbelievable			0
the bumps and hollows , the scary reads -- we had them all and very early on i told myself to enjoy the experience , because this was not about the score , it was something to be savored			0
there were four of us : working press from all over the globe suddenly possessing the wide - eyed stare of excited children , with a glorious invitation to the pristine fairways of @entity3 -- living out our fantasies of actually playing the course			1
i remember playing the 16th and three - putting for a bogey			1
what they tell you about placing the ball in the correct position below the holes is absolutely true			0
on this and so many of the greens , there are impossible putts if you do n't play the correct approach shot			0
what was utterly fascinating was the opportunity to have a go at playing @entity52 ' chip shot at 16 from the previous day , which is arguably the greatest shot in modern times at @entity3			1
let me confirm , not that it is necessary , that the shot was impossible for mere mortals like myself			0
the vision to play that shot -- which helped @entity52 win his fourth @entity125 -- and the ability to execute it with such perfection was @entity129 - like			1
in the end , i carded eight pars , five bogeys and those five doubles			0
a round of 87 of which i 'm proud			0
we played from the members tees , as instructed , but i confess to playing on the @entity20 tees on all of the par - threes			1
there were so many wonderful experiences that day , as i savored the experience and stood in spots where so many iconic shots have been been struck down through the years			0
you 'll always remember your first time , and for me , it was a day that i will never , ever forget .			1
