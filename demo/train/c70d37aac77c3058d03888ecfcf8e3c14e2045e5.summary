" check out the full @entity18 below : 1			0
@entity1 , " @entity8 " -- 267,000 this is @entity20 's third straight number one after 2009 ′ s " @entity21 , " which debuted with 318,000 , and 2007 ′ s " @entity22 , " which started with 527,000			1
@entity20 's 2005 debut " some @entity31 " is her only album to not reach the summit of the chart — it debuted at no. 2 with 315,000 ( behind @entity29 's " @entity28 " ) and eventually sold 7.2 million copies			1
her current single " good girl " has climbed up to no. 8 on the country songs chart , and follow - up " @entity8 , " which she performed on the @entity35 stage last week , kicks off its run at no. 22 on the @entity38 chart			1
@entity10 , " @entity11 " -- 110,000 @entity10 could have stayed the course and made lovely , jazz - tinged , perhaps slightly snoozy records and gone platinum for the rest of her career ( her @entity49 - winning debut " @entity47 " sold over 10 million copies , and her three subsequent records have all reached platinum status ) , but the chanteuse took a risk with her darker , @entity12 - produced fifth album			1
as such , " @entity11 " opened to @entity54 ' lowest sales ever — but somehow , we doubt she 's too worried about it			0
various artists , " now 42 " -- 95,000 the last five editions of the popular compilation albums have debuted in third place			0
it 's the hits , kids : @entity66 's " @entity65 ) , " @entity67 's " @entity64 , " @entity68 's " brokenhearted " and more			0
@entity69 , " 21 " -- 77,000 at this point , what 's left say ? last week , it had sold roughly 8.9 million copies ; now , it 's rounding out on 9 million			1
@entity69 's world domination continues			0
@entity13 , " @entity75 " -- 76,000 the @entity78 rapper 's sophomore album sold slightly fewer copies than his 2010 debut " @entity81 : the @entity82 , " which started at number one with sales of 84,000 and ended up selling about 597,000 copies total			1
still , after a handful of singles that did n't exactly burn up the chart ( " @entity75 " and " @entity89 " both failed to make much of an impact on radio ) , @entity13 should be happy with these results			0
it seems his late - in - the - game pop - oriented material , like @entity97 tune " @entity100 " and @entity99 collaboration " @entity104 " ( which debuts at number 8 on this week 's @entity38 chart ) , helped lift the album 's fortunes in the weeks leading to its release			1
@entity109 , " @entity110 " -- 64,000 the soft - rock star 's country comeback record has sold 679,000 copies in six weeks			1
say you , say him , say platinum : it was also just certified for shipments of 1 million copies to stores			0
@entity121 , " @entity122 " -- 56,000 the onetime @entity124 frontman , who earned his first chart - topping week ever last week , dropped by 59 percent after last week 's debut , still giving him 194,000 total in two weeks			2
@entity127 , " @entity128 " -- 45,000 after eight weeks , the @entity130 boy band has sold a whopping 586,000 units of their debut effort			0
that 's what makes them beautiful ( at least to @entity136 )			0
soundtrack , " @entity137 " -- 40,000 the first collection of songs sfrom @entity17 's inside - @entity145 musical drama " smash " started slower than the first " @entity142 " soundtrack , which debuted at number 4 in november 2009 , but that 's to be expected given " @entity143 's " smaller audience and general proportion of pop covers to originals			2
@entity14 , " @entity151 " -- 38,000 he may have been born to his lowest numbers yet — but it 's still the @entity155 ' seventh top 10 album			2
