-- it 's depressing to see what has become of the @entity3 , where immigration is concerned			1
a political party that , just 30 years ago , stood tall in defense of freedom and embodied the limitless opportunity for which @entity9 is famous is now stuck playing defense			2
we 've gone from @entity12 declaring , " mr. @entity13 , tear down this wall " in @entity15 to @entity3 sens. @entity16 of @entity17 and @entity18 of @entity19 demanding another 700 miles of border fencing along the @entity9 - @entity22 border			1
at least these two senators are proposing something			0
the naysayers who have pounded away daily at the @entity28 immigration bill in the hopes of defeating it have not , for the most part , set forth any credible or reasonable proposals of their own			1
the best they can do is to block what someone else has proposed			0
that 's their definition of victory			2
that 's the game in the @entity39 , where the debate is headed now that the @entity28 has approved the immigration reform bill by a vote of 68 to 32			1
the " yes " votes included 14 from @entity3			1
many of them came at a high price -- more than $ 30 billion in new border enforcement measures , via the @entity16 - @entity18 amendment			1
but where are the new ideas about how to provide a legal workforce of laborers who will do jobs that @entity9 shun ? where was the effort to streamline the legal immigration process so that those who play by the rules are n't punished for doing so ? aside from the four @entity3 senators in the @entity62 -- @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 -- most of the senators who voted " yes " on the final bill had offered nothing to make it better			1
leadership requires more than simply voting the right way			0
@entity12 , who said during the 1980 campaign that he supported giving legal status to illegal immigrants and who in 1986 signed an amnesty bill that legalized more than 3 million people -- would be ashamed of what has become of his party			1
today , when it comes to immigration , there is no imagination , boldness or grandeur			2
@entity3 leaders could choose to pitch @entity9 on several big themes -- optimism , hope , renewal , confidence , etc. they could try to convince us that our country 's best days are ahead of it , and that immigrants will help lead the way			1
instead , republicans are doing what comes easy : peddling fear and scaring the wits out of everyday @entity9			0
this is not exactly new			0
in the mid- 18th century , @entity105 tried to scare his fellow @entity9 into thinking that @entity108 immigrants would soon " be so numerous as to germanize us instead of us anglifying them			0
" later , it was feared that the @entity110 were " not assimilable " into society , that the @entity111 were -- in the words of sen. @entity113 of @entity114 -- " diminishing the quality of our citizenship , " and that the @entity117 were naturally predisposed to criminal behavior			0
and of course , no matter who was coming ashore , there were always the perennial fears that newcomers take jobs , consume resources , spread disease , crowd schools and lower the standard of living for everyone else			0
remarkably , over the last 230 years , the script has stayed pretty much the same			0
this so - called nation of immigrants has always been afraid of immigrants			0
i 've been listening in to the latest round of fear mongering -- " @entity137 " -- which is epitomized by the handful of @entity3 lawmakers , and their allies , who have spent the last few months trying to defeat the @entity28 bill			1
you hear it from talk radio , right - wing blogs and conservative columnists			0
the goal is to convince us that , if @entity151 passes immigration reform and grants legal status to millions of illegal immigrants , @entity9 should be afraid of 10 things			1
-- that those who gain legal status will include , in the words of the union representing immigration agents , child molesters , drunken drivers and gang members ; -- that more immigrants will come illegally in the months to come , because of the promise of legalization ; -- that more immigrants will come legally in the years to come , sponsored by newly legalized family members ; -- that those who get legal status wo n't learn @entity169 or assimilate but instead create a country within a country ; -- that the newly legalized will go on welfare , usurp public benefits and bankrupt the system ; -- that this is a fool 's errand for the @entity3 because the immigrants wo n't vote for republicans anyway ; -- that the newly legalized might , upon becoming citizens , actually punish @entity3 for years of mistreatment ; -- that the country is changing demographically to the point where whites will soon be in the minority , and a legalization program would only speed up the process ; -- that immigrants will worsen population growth , overcrowd our schools , and lower @entity9 ' standard of living ; -- and , finally , that this will create , as sen. @entity195 of @entity196 claims , a " de facto affirmative action " by providing an incentive to employers to hire them over @entity9 citizens because they 're not covered by @entity203 mandates			1
this is the @entity3 message in all its glory			2
it 's based on speculation and half - truths and worst - case scenarios that make the most sense to those who know the least about immigrants			2
and it 's not helpful			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			2

@entity219 : @entity3 naysayers hammer at immigration reform , but offer no ideas
he says a few @entity3 voted yes on @entity28 bill , but even those came at high cost
he says immigration *advocate* @entity12 would be ashamed of party 's fear - mongering
he says @entity3 peddles *illogical* , *inaccurate* reasons to hold up immigration reform
