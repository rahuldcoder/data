-- on tuesday , a man identified by authorities as @entity3 boarded a school bus as it stopped to drop off children and demanded two students			2
police say that when the bus driver , @entity3 , refused , @entity3 -- who was arrested last month , accused of shooting at neighbors in a dispute over a speed bump -- shot @entity11 four times , killing him			2
as i 'm writing this , he is in a standoff with police , who say he 's holding someone 's 5 - year - old boy hostage in his underground doomsday bunker			1
also on tuesday , 15 - year - old @entity21 was gunned down in @entity22 , allegedly by someone who thought she and her friends were members of a rival gang			1
it was raining , and the teens were standing underneath a shelter in a park			0
a park that is about a mile north of the home of president @entity34 's home			0
and just a little over a week ago , @entity35 was a participant in @entity34 's inauguration festivities as a member of the @entity40 band			0
that 's just one day in the life of @entity43			1
... i wonder what tomorrow will bring			0
a @entity47 poll found that 85 % of @entity43 back a universal background check to limit the ability of convicted felons and the mentally ill to get a gun -- and yet we wait			1
on wednesday , the @entity53 announced that the @entity55 pregame show will feature a performance of " @entity57 " by 26 students and faculty members from @entity60			0
the @entity62 massacre was supposed to change things , change us			1
even while the @entity53 announced its gesture , a gunman whom police identified as 70 - year - old @entity67 went inside a @entity70 office building and shot three people , one fatally			1
and yet we continue to wait -- hoping tomorrow does n't bring more senseless shootings , more gunned - down babies , more pleas for change			1
the victims of @entity62 deserve more			1
with so much blood flowing through our streets , the issue of gun control should not belong to red states or blue ones			0
it should be wedded to the idea that we deserve more			0
but as long as cowardly politicians continue to have their sense of morality held hostage by the @entity90 , we will continue to wait , even as more loved ones are violently taken from us			2
you know , @entity92 said there was nothing he dreaded more than " a division of the republic into two great parties , each arranged under its leadership , and concerting measures in opposition to each other			0
" and @entity104 once said he " never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever , in religion , in philosophy , in politics or in anything else where i was capable of thinking for myself			0
" i wonder how many more days will pass , how many more lives will be lost , before the people who claim to love our forefathers so much actually take heed of some of the words they said			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity124			1
