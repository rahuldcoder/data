" ms. @entity6 's detailed statement ... is insufficient to support a criminal charge given other contradictory evidence , conflicting witness statements , credibility issues , lack of forensic evidence and denials by mr. @entity1			0
" @entity1 's office in @entity38 , @entity39 , released a statement saying the former vice president was pleased with the finding			2
