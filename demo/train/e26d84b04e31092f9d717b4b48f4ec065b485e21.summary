-- @entity2 prime minister @entity1 said friday that the government 's newly unveiled spending plans for 2013 are a " combat budget " that will tackle debt and bring much needed growth to the nation			1
about 30 billion euros ( $ 39 billion ) in savings are needed to reach president @entity11 's ambitious target of lowering the deficit to 3 % of gross domestic product by the end of 2013 , from a forecast of 4.5 % this year			1
a third of the savings will come from cuts to public spending , the president 's office said , while an additional 10 billion euros will come from a tax on companies			1
the remainder will be raised through tax increases on high - earning individuals , including a 75 % levy on incomes higher than 1 million euros ( $ 1.26 million ) and a new 45 % tax bracket affecting 6.2 million households			1
however , nine out of 10 earners will not see income tax increases , the government said			1
the 2013 budget is viewed as a test of confidence for @entity11 , who was elected in may on a pro-growth and anti-austerity platform , and his socialist government			2
addressing reporters after a meeting of ministers friday morning , @entity1 sought to stress that the tough measures were necessary -- and that most of the burden would fall on those best able to pay			2
" it 's a combat budget to fight against a debt that only continues to increase and that rests on the shoulders of @entity2 taxpayers and generations to come , " he said , adding that it was " a courageous and responsible budget			1
" @entity1 said the @entity2 national debt had increased from 64 % of gdp to more than 90 % in five years -- and that 's why the government 's deficit reduction target must be met			1
" the 3 % is a realistic objective , it is an indispensable objective , " he said			0
@entity1 also said that the budget , while cutting public spending , is one " which made choices " in favor of lower - wage earners			1
" the working and middle classes have been exempted from the revenue tax			0
nine households out of 10 ... will not be taxed further , this is the guarantee that we are giving to the @entity2 people , " he said			1
who is @entity11 ? speaking this month in front of the @entity74 , a government financial body , @entity11 said the reduction of public debt was going to be " the most important effort in 30 years			2
" however , some economists , including those at @entity81 , anticipate that the government 's deficit reduction target will be missed , with @entity81 forecasting a deficit for the year of 3.7 % of gdp			0
political analyst @entity84 , of broadcaster @entity2 3 , told @entity0 that the @entity2 public was also skeptical about the government 's ability to reduce the deficit without raising taxes more widely			2
" a majority of the @entity2 know that 2013 is going to be for them a very terrible year , " he said , citing tax hikes , continued high unemployment and difficult times for entrepreneurs as among the challenges they face			2
" the @entity2 are very aware of the fact that everyone will have to pay			0
" the government 's move to raise an extra 10 billion euros from taxes on businesses could further stifle growth and force companies to move overseas , @entity84 said			1
many people in @entity2 now fear that @entity2 could join other southern @entity109 nations such as @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 , whose ailing economies have prompted wider fears about the stability of the eurozone group of nations , he added			0
as the fifth - largest economy in the world and the second - largest in @entity109 , @entity2 is a major concern to global investors			0
it 's also the @entity124 ' third - largest trading partner in @entity109 , after @entity125 and the @entity126 , the @entity122 says			0
analysts had predicted that @entity11 would have to present a harsher budget than first expected because of fears that otherwise , @entity2 's cost of borrowing will spike , and any savings made will have to be spent on increased interest payments			1
since his election in may , the @entity2 president has been under growing pressure to reduce the national debt , boost growth and create new jobs , while seeking to avoid angering the public with big cuts in public spending			1
but his popularity has already taken a knock since he beat the incumbent , @entity145 , to the top job			0
a survey conducted by polling firm @entity148 for the @entity149 last sunday suggested that four months into his presidency , only 43 % of @entity2 people are satisfied with @entity11			2
this was an 11 % drop in his satisfaction rating , compared with august			0
the figure represents one of the worst popularity plunges for a @entity2 leader in decades , the newspaper said			0
by comparison , @entity145 's satisfaction rating at the same point in his presidency , surveyed by @entity148 in september 2007 , was 61 % , @entity162 reports			0
@entity11 acts over wealth tax crisis figures released friday by the country 's national statistics institute reveal zero growth in @entity2 in the second quarter of 2012 , compared with the first quarter , @entity0 affiliate @entity167 reports			2
however , individual spending power increased slightly over the same period , after several quarters of decline			0
speaking thursday on public television station @entity2 2 , @entity1 said that the government was aware of the gravity of its mission and that it has a long - term plan for the country 's future			1
the prime minister defended the government 's forecast 0.8 % growth rate for 2013 as " realistic , " rejecting doubts about the figure as " defeatist			2
" he also said it was important to set ambitious targets to tackle rising unemployment			0
the country 's unemployment rate stood at 10.2 % at the end of june this year , according to the @entity169			0
@entity2 's budget announcement comes against a backdrop of unease in the 17 - nation eurozone , where many governments are plagued by high debt and low growth			1
neighboring @entity110 announced its own budget thursday , outlining new spending cuts , tax increases and structural adjustments aimed at bringing down its huge deficit			1
the government 's efforts have proved unpopular with many @entity110 , who have taken to the streets in large numbers to demonstrate against austerity measures			0
@entity110 's next crisis : regional splits ? @entity0 's @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 contributed to this report .			0
