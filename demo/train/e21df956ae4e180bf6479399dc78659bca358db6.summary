@entity0 -- more than six decades ago , the @entity3 's founder @entity2 shared his vision for the region 's nascent union , prescribing money as a means to heal the wounds left by two world wars			1
" the fusion " of @entity15 's economic ties , he said , would compel its nations " to fuse their sovereignty " as well " into that of a single @entity15 state			1
" to the @entity20 , a federal @entity15 was the natural progression of the bloc 's newfound stability			1
a collection of like - minded countries whose shared goals were so clear they would willingly surrender their own governments for the group 's greater good			0
a time when the future held great promise after the horrors of the past and anything seemed possible -- even creating a new pseudo country			1
a place now known as the @entity40			2
fast forward to the present day and , though the @entity40 does have some shared organs of government , like a commission and parliament , it certainly is n't the set of " united states " @entity2 hoped for			1
ones with the same deep - seated convictions and beliefs			0
the glue holding their common ideologies together came unstuck with the fall of the @entity55			0
since then , a crisis among countries sharing the euro has reopened old wounds			0
ironically , instead of bringing nations together , their finances have threatened to tear them apart			0
this leaves us with one fundamental question : if the @entity40 's main task is no longer to provide peace , and it ca n't guarantee prosperity either , then what should its role be ? born from the ashes of @entity15 's turbulent past , the @entity40 has accomplished much for its members			1
it has taught its citizens value of compromise over violence , providing protection and strength in numbers			0
it has boosted prosperity , thanks to the free flow of goods and labor brought about by the single market , while consumer and workers ' rights have been reinforced and their health improved thanks to bans on smoking			0
but the @entity40 has also drifted far from its original concept , its ranks swollen by a massive @entity98 - based bureaucratic machine which , critics say , is stifling industry and is pushing members like the @entity102 towards the exit door			2
the bloc 's borders have doubled with its endless absorption of former communist countries , stretching the definition of @entity15 to its limits , making membership to this formerly elite club appear more like a handy foreign policy tool rather than a cherished vision			1
the @entity40 faces a constant challenge living up to the expectations of its citizens and without two - tier policies it has no hope of serving both the bloc 's strong and weak economies alike			1
the @entity40 needs a new vision a new project its people can feel passionate about			2
and where better to start then this week 's pivotal parliamentary elections			2

the @entity3 's founder @entity2 laid out his vision for the bloc more than six decades ago
it was a time when the future held great promise after the horrors of two world wars
but fast forward to now , and the @entity40 is struggling to identify its vision after financial crisis
the @entity15 elections are key , and @entity146 says the union needs a new vision
