with carnival under way and @entity4 on february 17 , it 's high season for reflecting on the virtues of @entity7			1
the city rolls at a different pace during @entity10 , with parade routes blocking access to certain neighborhoods at outwardly mysterious times and businesses closing or amending their hours to accommodate the season 's unique needs			1
flexibility , a strong sense of adventure and a costume on @entity4 will help @entity10 visitors make the most of it			1
while the @entity7 is never entirely predictable -- and a good dose of whimsy is always the best preparation for a trip to @entity7 -- the following must - do list could serve as a guide for visitors arriving after the final carnival parade rolls down @entity32			1
while we could write an encyclopedia on the city 's food and music options alone , these 15 suggestions will help you start to experience the heart of this low , lovely , lyrical place			1
eat with your hands among the benefits of dining in a shellfish culture is that silverware is frequently optional			1
eating with your hands is the only way to get through a bowl of buttery , pepper - spiked bbq shrimp at @entity51 's @entity50 , where the iconic dish was first conceived			1
boiled crawfish is the seasonal delicacy from roughly january through may , and it 's arguably best eaten on a park bench with a cold one			2
@entity57 in @entity58 and @entity59 in @entity60 are reliable crawfish takeout spots			2
and locals tend to tip oysters on the half - shell up to their lips rather than mess with those awkward , tiny forks			0
at @entity69 in the @entity70 and @entity71 in @entity58 , no one expects you to use those forks for anything besides squeezing the juice from lemon wedges over your catch			0
@entity79 's most colorful carnivals browse a supermarket especially at locally owned grocery stores like @entity82 and @entity83 's , you can stock your suitcase -- and , later , your pantry -- with @entity87 dry goods staples like @entity89 red beans , @entity91 rice , @entity92 ( try the @entity93 ) , @entity95 - style coffee , crab boil and boxed jambalaya mix. even if you ca n't find room among your boas and beads for smuggling food products home , it 's worth a wander down the spice aisle to observe in what amazing quantities @entity107 stock up on bay leaves and cayenne pepper			1
cool off with a sno - ball @entity7 ' best ammunition against the subtropical heat of its eight - or - so summer months is , perhaps counter-intuitively , not alcoholic			1
sno - balls ( not snow cones ) are simple but culturally important treats of finely shaved ice drenched in sugary syrups			0
they come served in cups or @entity122 take - out containers and are generally sold from trucks , takeaway windows and small sweet shops			0
your favorite sno - ball vendor is generally the closest sno - ball vendor , though our pick is @entity58 's @entity130 , where the syrup flavors range from the traditional ( nectar , chocolate , cream of strawberry ) to the uber - contemporary ( satsuma , cardamom , ginger )			2
get your bounce on @entity140 might have brought twerking -- a dance move that involves shaking one 's rump at the speed of a hummingbird 's wings -- to a popular audience at @entity150 's @entity149 in 2013 , but @entity7 dancers have been " popping " since the late 1980s			1
in a @entity154 article , local music writer @entity152 even presented evidence that @entity140 learned to twerk to @entity7 bounce music while filming a movie here in 2010 and 2011			1
check in at @entity159 for bounce news and up - to - date club listings			0
take a literary tour @entity7 collects literary ghosts , @entity164 , @entity165 and @entity166 among them			1
besides reading works penned while writers were encamped in the city , the best way to channel the city 's literary life is by touring the @entity70 's numerous and wonderfully atmospheric used and new book stores			2
call it antiquing for the mind			0
our favorites include @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 , a store specializing in used cookbooks			0
local author @entity184 's book , " the @entity189 's guide to @entity7 , " is a great resource for unpacking the city 's literary dimension			1
eat beignets the centenarian , open - air coffee and beignet spot @entity191 might be the most obvious tourist attraction in the @entity70 , if not the entire city			0
as we 're in the business of steering visitors to @entity7 ' more genuine experiences , you might expect us to avoid such clich√©s			1
a beignet - free trip to @entity7 would be a travesty of the first order , and @entity191 has a high batting average for serving a consistently hot and well - sugared product			1
the queue can be excruciating , though , so keep the nearby @entity211 , as well as the @entity213 location of @entity214 , in your back pocket			0
@entity216 at the @entity217 in a city surrounded by water -- the @entity221 , @entity222 , the ever - encroaching @entity223 -- it 's sometimes surprising how infrequently you encounter water views			2
@entity225 , adjacent to the @entity70 , is an exception ; it 's also a wonderful place to pass a breezy hour or two			2
but for a birds - eye view of the winding @entity217 and its workings , take the elevator at @entity231 ( located at the foot of @entity233 ) skyward			0
alternately , " @entity243 " at @entity244 , just behind the @entity245 in @entity58 , is an expanse of ball fields and green space from which you can watch magnificent barges push down the river at eye level -- and practically at arm 's length			2
see @entity246 off - screen experience the real - life companion to @entity252 's @entity251 series " @entity246 " by exploring what is sometimes referred to as @entity256 's oldest @entity255 neighborhood			2
you could begin just across @entity258 from the @entity70 at @entity259			0
then make your way to @entity261 for a @entity263 history lesson , worship at a jazz - filled @entity265 at @entity267 and lunch on @entity95 gumbo , seafood platters and po - boys at @entity272			0
take a @entity274 tour @entity274 tours are touchy , and with good reason			0
cruising in air - conditioned buses or vans through previously flooded neighborhoods where the worst possible scenario occurred -- and where , more than nine years later , life is hardly back to normal -- is inherently controversial			0
but seeing the altered neighborhoods with a knowledgeable guide is also the best way to unpack the natural and human - wrought causes behind @entity274 's remarkable losses of life , land and property			2
drink a @entity290 @entity7 had a cocktail culture long before " mixologist " entered the popular lexicon and specialty cocktail bars augmented the nation 's bar topography			1
though it 's also drunk in other cities , @entity7 has laid claim to the @entity290 , a stiff drink of rye whiskey , bitters , sugar , absinthe or pastis and a twist of lemon			1
mixologists make reputable versions in their cocktail bars around town , but the best places to drink @entity312 are where they 've always done well -- in historic hotel bars like the @entity315 in the @entity316 or the @entity317 in the @entity318 ; and in the city 's oldest restaurants , like @entity321 's and @entity322 's			1
go to @entity10 if you ca n't make it down for the actual holiday , you can still peek at the pageantry			1
tours at @entity328 offer spectacular behind - the - scenes looks at float production and costumes , as well as off - season tastes of king cake			0
lunch on fried chicken in the @entity335 , twice just two blocks apart , the kitchens at @entity338 's @entity337 and @entity339 arguably put out the city 's most consistently fine fried chicken , though only at lunch			2
the restaurants and their 90 - plus - year - old matriarchs are not at war , but instead coexist peacefully , with differences in ambiance and chicken - frying styles			0
@entity338 's is a more casual restaurant with chicken cooked to order , while @entity352 is a white - tablecloth establishment with a lunch buffet			2
turn on the radio wherever you listen to 90.7 @entity361 community - supported radio ( you can stream online from anyplace ) , it sounds like @entity87			0
listen long enough and you 'll find your favorite djs and shows -- for us , it 's @entity373 's @entity372 on fridays and the back - to - back @entity374 and bluegrass programs on sunday mornings			2
local food media personality @entity376 hosts a three - hour radio show about @entity7 food every weekday afternoon on 1350 am			1
it also airs on 105.3 fm on saturdays			0
and the local @entity384 station , @entity385 , is rife with local programming			0
find some brass especially in the spring , around @entity10 and @entity389 , it 's nearly impossible to walk down a @entity7 sidewalk without eavesdropping on some school kid practicing his trumpet or her trombone			1
music begins in the schools and in the neighborhoods			0
second line parades , which include brass bands , roll every sunday during the cooler months			0
and in - between the beads and masks in carnival parades are junior high and high school marching bands high - stepping and getting the crowds moving			0
for nighttime brass sounds year - round , you can count on clubs like @entity409 , @entity410 and @entity411 , where the @entity412 raises the roof every tuesday night			0
see some art , and eat some too @entity7 has a centrally located arts district , commonly called the @entity416 , which is a little - known relative to the city 's more historic and heavily toured neighborhoods			1
the @entity420 ( @entity421 ) is the district 's anchor , though it 's no longer the only attraction			2
additionally , the @entity426 , the @entity427 , the @entity428 and numerous galleries and art spaces have built a neighborhood where you could easily spend a couple of days			0
to sweeten the pot , the @entity416 happens to be a culinary hotbed , with top - tier restaurants like the @entity438 's @entity437 and @entity439 , @entity440 's flagship restaurant @entity440 's @entity7 , @entity444 's steakhouse @entity442 and @entity445 at the @entity446			1
@entity7 transplant @entity447 is the author of " @entity449 : finding my place at the @entity451			1
" this story was first published in 2014 and updated in february 2015 .			0

there 's more to celebrate than @entity10 in @entity7
shellfish culture means silverware is n't always required at the table
' popping " predates the @entity140 visit to this town
