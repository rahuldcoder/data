the @entity1 government banned @entity2 on thursday , less than a week after @entity3 made a similar blackout of the social networking site @entity6 , which is estimated to have more than 10 million @entity1 users			1
neither website can be reached on @entity1 internet networks			0
the crackdown comes just days before @entity1 are expected to go to the polls in nationwide municipal elections			2
the @entity1 government said its @entity2 block came as a response to the leak of a conversation between top government officials purportedly discussing the possibility of going to war with neighboring @entity20			1
@entity1 's top media regulating agency announced a similar ban on the broadcast of the conversation to television and radio channels			0
" it is seen as appropriate that a temporary broadcast ban be implemented on the voice recordings on social media and alleged to be between the foreign minister , the head of the @entity32 and military officials , " the @entity34 -- @entity1 's chief media regulating agency -- announced on its website			2
@entity1 's political elite has been battered by a campaign of wiretap leaks recorded by unknown operatives and distributed daily for more than a month on the @entity42			0
until wednesday , all of the wiretaps seemed to be recordings of phone conversations between @entity1 prime minister @entity47 , his inner circle , government officials and some top corporate executives			1
@entity47 has called some recordings " immorally edited material , " including a conversation in which a man who sounds like the prime minister purportedly instructs his son to hide tens of millions of dollars in cash from police investigators			0
but he has also confirmed the authenticity of other wiretaps , in which he is heard instructing the head of a major television news network to cut short the live broadcast of a rival politician 's speech in @entity66			0
@entity1 's government has accused social media platforms , including @entity6 and @entity69 , of being used to spread false information and lies since the leaked , high - level conversations from inside the current government have spread online			1
" we 're seeing reports that some users are not able to access @entity2 in @entity1			2
there is no technical issue on our side and we 're looking into the situation , " a @entity77 spokesperson said in a statement			0
@entity2 is owned by @entity77			2
unlike previously leaked recordings -- which all sounded like telephone conversations -- the recording released on wednesday sounds like audio coming from a microphone planted in a room where a meeting is being held			0
male @entity1 voices can be heard discussing whether to send troops into neighboring @entity20 , where @entity1 has supported rebels against the government in @entity93 during a conflict that has lasted more than three years			1
" monitoring such a meeting of a highly confidential nature which was held at a location such as the office of the foreign minister , where the most sensitive security issues of the @entity103 are discussed and releasing these conversations to the public are a despicable attack , an act of espionage and a very serious crime against the national security of @entity1 , " announced @entity1 's @entity95 in a statement on thursday			1
the recording suggests a major security breach within the halls of the country 's @entity95			0
the bans on @entity6 and @entity2 may be followed by a broader crackdown on the @entity42			2
an official at @entity1 's prime ministry , speaking on the condition of anonymity , told @entity121 , " if there are recordings similarly threatening to national security , there can be similar precautions taken on other social media			0
" this week a @entity1 court overruled the government 's ban of @entity6 , but the website is still blocked			1
according to legal procedures , @entity1 authorities have 30 days to implement the court injunction .			1

@entity1 authorities have blocked @entity2 days after banning @entity6
government action comes after alleged conversations about war with @entity20 are leaked
the leak is " a despicable attack , an act of espionage , " the @entity95 says
@entity77 , which owns @entity2 , is looking into the blocking , a spokesperson says
