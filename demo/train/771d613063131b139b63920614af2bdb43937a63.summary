-- the new @entity1 is n't the perfect character			1
just like the literary creations that live and die on its screen , it has flaws			2
it 's wise , though it still suffers from memories of its past			2
but in the great e-reader saga , it 's clearly the protagonist , and one worth rooting for			1
the @entity17 's screen is brilliant in the literal sense of the word , as it glows			1
the new @entity1 is n't the first e-reader with a screen that lights up : @entity22 beat @entity23 to the punch by five months with its @entity25 with @entity26			1
but the light - up screen on the new kindle surpasses the one on the nook because it solves most ( but not all ) of the light uniformity issues evident on the earlier device			1
. granted , illuminating an e-ink screen is difficult			0
the most common solution is to use a nano - printed " light guide " â € ” the leds sit at the bottom of the device , and a thin plastic screen with tiny patterns etched into it carries the light toward the middle and top of the display			1
the scores gradually disperse the beams , allowing more light to permeate to the top as the nano guides get further form the light source			1
this creates an even distribution of soft light , and the whole screen gently glows			2
it 's much less fatiguing than a back - lit screen ( like a tablet ) and is more comfortable during late - night reading sessions			2
but , like the @entity29 , the light source creates a problem : blossoms of led light appear at the bottom of the screen			1
it 's fainter than the light - source bleed found on the @entity29 , but it 's still there			2
it 's only annoying at the bottom of the screen , but it breaks up the flow of an otherwise flawless screen			1
fortunately , the attention @entity23 has paid to the rest of the screen makes up for these lighting hiccups			1
text on the @entity1 is darker and crisper than what i 've seen on previous - generation @entity78			2
also , the background color of the screen is lighter than previous kindles			0
it 's less " cardboard " and more " coffee with too much milk			0
" @entity23 says the @entity17 has 25 percent more contrast			1
without busting out the contrast spectrometer to test @entity23 's claim , i 'm going to go with what i can see , and when compared to my last - generation @entity1 , it 's clear @entity23 has indeed increased the contrast of the screen			1
but this is n't just a screen you look at ; it 's one you touch			2
@entity23 has added a finish to the capacitive screen that feels like the paper stock used in high - end hardcover books			1
it 's a small detail , and if it were absent , it would n't detract from the e-reader			2
but , it 's a nice touch that gives the screen a tactile feel not found on other e-readers			1
one thing i would 've liked to have seen on the @entity1 : physical page - turn buttons			1
touchscreens are great and all , but when you end up losing your place in a book , all the touchy - swipey technology in the world ca n't sway my belief that sometimes , a physical button is better			0
even without buttons , the physical execution of the @entity1 puts it ahead of the competition			1
it 's light , eminently pocketable , and presents the best electronic reading experience			1
so the fact that @entity23 raised the bar with updates to the @entity1 's software feature set is just gravy on the cake			1
the screen is divided into three sectors			0
tap one sector to navigate forward , one to navigate backward , and one to bring up the menu			0
the " page forward " sector gets the largest swath of real estate , encompassing the bottom 80 percent of the screen and 80 percent of the right - hand side			2
the left 20 percent is reserved to go back a page			0
this layout make sense , considering most touches are to advance a book			0
the remaining top 20 percent of the screen is reserved for access to the system menu			2
after a few missed taps while trying to find the sweet spot , i was able to navigate to the next page while holding the @entity1 in my left hand			2
i 'm a big guy with large hands , so reaching over that 20 percent portion of screen with my thumb is easy			0
your tapping mileage may vary			0
the underlying platform is really the true make - it - or - break - it feature of any e-reader , and @entity23 has this dialed			1
your current location in the book in displayed in the lower left - hand corner			0
more impressive is the e-reader 's ability to learn your reading speed and give you information on how long it will take you to finish a chapter , or the entire book			2
i used this " time to read " feature at night to help determine if i should stay up another 45 minutes to finish a chapter or just go to sleep			0
the x-ray feature that premiered on the @entity178 is also available on the @entity1			2
it 's an incredibly helpful way to keep track of the hundreds of characters in fantasy novels ( or just the five characters in a regular book )			0
i found it especially helpful when reading multiple books in a series like " @entity188 , " and i needed help determining which guy was doing the beheading			0
and it 's easy to get trapped reading multiple books at once , thanks to @entity23 's ecosystem			1
not just the blockbusters ( everyone has those ) , but the @entity198 , the sample chapters , the periodicals , the textbooks , the lending services			0
nobody can compete with the online retailer 's services , or the breadth of its catalog			0
@entity209 subscribers get access to books that can be borrowed for no additional cost			0
and all of this is accessible from the @entity1 's built - in bookstore â € ” which is serviceable , though it 's still easier to shop on a real computer			1
the @entity1 starts at $ 120			1
that 's for the @entity217 - only , ad - supported model			0
you can get the ad - free kindle for $ 140 , but since you never see an ad in - book ( only on the sleep screen , or when browsing your library ) it does n't really matter			1
in fact , my test unit eventually ended up showing me something i wanted to buy			0
throw in free worldwide @entity230 , and the prices jump to $ 180 and $ 200			0
it 's useful if you 're buying books while sitting on the beach in @entity235			0
otherwise , save yourself some money and go @entity217			0
i should also point out that @entity22 just dropped the light - up @entity29 's price to $ 120 â € ” and that 's without ads. but i 'd still recommend the @entity1			1
it has the better software features , the stellar screen , and the unstoppable ecosystem			0
it keeps its crown as king of the e-readers			0

review : @entity1 keeps @entity23 at top of the pile for e-readers
there 's a little light bleeding at screen bottom , but overall feel makes up for it
@entity17 uses only touchscreen with no physical buttons
e-reader is $ 120 with ads or $ 140 without
