" @entity8 is the leader that our troops deserve , " @entity13 said			1
if @entity25 is confirmed , the @entity24 would be led by someone who advocated deep cuts to its budget			2
he 's bucked his fellow republicans in opposing troop surges in @entity33 and @entity34 , telling his biographer : " i will do all i can to prevent war			2
" and he 's come under fire over comments about @entity39 , a top @entity12 ally , and @entity41 , a top @entity12 foe			1

but @entity25 said he 's eager to answer critics			1
until @entity13 's announcement that ended weeks of speculation over his nomination , @entity25 told the @entity57 newspaper in his home state that he 'd been " hanging out there in no - man 's land unable to respond to charges , falsehoods and distortions " about his record			1
now , he said , he has " an opportunity to set the record straight			1
" " all i ask is a fair hearing , and i will get that , " @entity25 told the paper			0
" i am very much looking forward to having a full , open , transparent hearing about my qualifications and my record			0
" @entity73 , who will chair those hearings as head of the @entity77 in the @entity78 - controlled @entity16 , praised @entity25 's qualifications and said the panel would give " prompt and careful " consideration to his nomination			1
what 's really behind @entity25 nomination fight @entity33 , @entity41 , gay rights among hot - button issues @entity25 , 66 , said monday that he was honored @entity13 had " confidence in me and not unmindful of the immense responsibilities that go with it			1

" at the same news conference where he announced the nomination of @entity108 as @entity110 director , @entity13 praised @entity25 as a " patriot " who knows what it 's like being on the frontline , in part from his year fighting alongside his brother in @entity7			1
" he understands that sending young @entity12 to fight and bleed in the dirt and mud is something that we only do when it 's absolutely necessary			0
" opinion : @entity124 , do n't fight the @entity126 nomination the president , a @entity127 , also said @entity25 's selection " represents the bipartisan tradition that we need more of in @entity130			1
" but many in the @entity124 establishment begged to differ			0
" he has long severed his ties with the @entity124 , " sen. @entity134 , @entity136 - @entity135 , said sunday , when news surfaced that @entity25 would be nominated			1
sen. @entity139 , a freshman @entity127 from @entity140 , countered that he believes " republicans are spoiling for a fight			0
" a host of issues swirling around @entity25 have set the stage for a contentious confirmation hearing with republicans expected to lead the charge against him			2
a few years after famously bucking his party in opposing a @entity12 troop " surge " in @entity33 , @entity25 voted against sending 30,000 additional troops in 2009 to @entity34 -- a move that put him at odds with @entity124 and @entity13			1
some also are bothered by a comment he made in 1998 about an ambassadorial candidate @entity158 being " openly , aggressively gay " -- which he apologized for in december , 14 years later			0

" @entity25 has also come under fire over @entity41			2
in addition to calling for talks with the @entity180 nation , which openly antagonizes @entity39 , @entity25 has spoken out against certain sanctions -- a cornerstone of @entity13 's foreign policy aimed at pressuring @entity184 over its nuclear program			1
the @entity186 notes that @entity25 was " one of only two senators to vote against the @entity41 - @entity190 sanctions act in 2001 , arguing that it would undercut efforts to engage with @entity184			2
" in a september editorial in the @entity194 , @entity25 -- writing with several others , including retired gen. @entity196 and former rep. @entity197 -- said that he thinks " all options ( should be ) on the table " regarding @entity41 , a stance that aligns him with @entity13 , as well as many @entity124			1
@entity124 senator : @entity25 would be ' antagonistic ' toward @entity39 but the most charged subject is likely @entity39 , with @entity134 arguing -- if confirmed -- @entity25 " would be the most antagonistic secretary of defense " toward @entity39 " in our nation 's history			1

in an interview that year , @entity25 said a " jewish lobby intimidated lawmakers " -- sparking sharp criticism from some @entity234 organizations and across the political spectrum			0
@entity134 has blasted what he calls " an in - your - face nomination by the president to all of us who are supportive " of @entity39			0
but others have rallied around him , including his friend rabbi @entity245 of @entity39 in @entity246 , @entity50			2
@entity245 , who grew up in @entity39 and says he 's personally open for talks with @entity212 and @entity224 , praised @entity25 as " definitely a friend of @entity39			1
he is independent , has wonderful , fresh ideas to try to reengage the discussion about the @entity180			0
" @entity25 told the @entity251 there is " not one shred of evidence that i 'm anti-israeli , not one ( @entity16 ) vote that matters that hurt @entity39 , " claiming his critics have " completely distorted " his record			1

such fiery rhetoric has prompted presidential nominees in the past to pull out			0
but the bumpy road ahead is unlikely to faze @entity25			0
" @entity8 is not afraid of challenge -- or risk , " his biographer , @entity273 , wrote in 2006			0
praise from @entity278 , criticism from @entity33 vet one high - profile @entity7 veteran standing by @entity25 is gen. @entity278 , a former @entity282 chairman who was secretary of state under the @entity124 administration of president @entity284			1

" gen. @entity295 , former @entity296 supreme allied commander , said @entity25 has earned the president 's trust			2
@entity25 's experience in @entity7 , which earned him two @entity300 , gave him " the proper appreciation for what it 's like on the ground , at the bottom , " @entity295 said			1
but rep. @entity306 , @entity307 , a veteran of the wars in @entity33 and @entity34 , is not supportive			1
" our troops deserve much better than a man who voted to send them to war when it was popular and then abandoned those very troops when it was unpopular , " he said			2
he was referring to @entity25 's 2002 vote authorizing the war in @entity33 and his ultimate opposition to it			1
willingness to speak his mind stirs criticism , support if he becomes defense secretary , @entity25 will be tasked with carrying out the orders of a president who concluded the war in @entity33 and plans to end @entity12 involvement in @entity34			2

" after a year of @entity7 's miserable heat , nearly constant danger , and violent campaigns like the @entity338 , @entity8 came back to the @entity12 ready to get on with things -- and with both a loyalty to the @entity12 military and a belief he should do all he could to prevent his nation 's being involved in another war			0

" " while it is easy for nations to blunder into war , they never blunder into peace , " he added			0
especially on foreign policy issues , @entity25 has shown time and again his willingness to speak his mind -- even if it goes against the prevailing @entity124 thinking or , in the case of the 2009 @entity34 surge , the position of @entity13			1
his independence has spawned critics , as well as cheers			0
