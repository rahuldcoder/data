@entity0 -- a week after @entity4 was ordered to pay $ 1 billion to @entity5 for patent infringements , a @entity3 court has backed the @entity8 company in another dispute with its @entity11 rival			1
the @entity12 on friday ruled that @entity4 did not infringe @entity5 's patents for its @entity14 and @entity15 for some of its @entity18 smartphones and the @entity18 tablet			1
the case focused on technology used in @entity4 's @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 7 devices to synchronize music and video with a computer -- technology @entity5 says its rival copied			1
however judge @entity30 disagreed and threw out @entity5 's 100 million yen ( $ 1.27 million ) claim and ordered the @entity33 - based tech giant to pay the costs of the lawsuit			2
it has 30 days to file an appeal			0
@entity4 to fight @entity11 court ruling in a statement released by @entity4 after the decision , it said : " we have been strongly appealing that our products do not infringe the patents of @entity5 @entity11 and its completely different technology			2
" the verdict recognizes the lawfulness of our company			0
we think it is very appropriate			0
" a ruling against @entity4 would have been a severe setback in one of its most lucrative markets			0
the @entity8 company is already facing the prospect of a @entity11 ban on @entity4 smartphones and computer tablets found to have violated @entity5 's patents -- described by one @entity4 executive as " absolutely the worst scenario for us			1
" this followed last friday 's decision by a @entity11 federal jury to order @entity4 to pay @entity5 $ 1.05 billion for copying the look and feel of the @entity14 and @entity15 design			1
a nine - person jury spent just two and a half days puzzling out its final verdict , with weeks of notes and memories of testimony , 109 pages of jury instructions , and boxes of evidence including a collection of contested smartphones and tablets as their guide			0
the lawsuit was the largest yet in the ongoing worldwide patent brawl between the two companies , which itself is just one battle in @entity5 's war against @entity90 's @entity89 mobile operating system			2
in another case just days before , a @entity8 court found that both parties had infringed on each other 's patents -- @entity4 was ordered to pay $ 33,300 for infringing two of the intellectual property rights for @entity5 's @entity14 and @entity15 , while @entity5 was found to have infringed @entity4 's @entity99 technology and ordered to pay $ 22,000 in damages			1
@entity1 's @entity101 and @entity102 contributed to this report .			0
