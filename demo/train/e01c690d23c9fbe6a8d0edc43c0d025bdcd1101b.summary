on the vast plains of the @entity2 plateau in @entity3 live people who believe in magic			1
many of the @entity7 -- an ancient , indigenous race found in @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 -- suppose that on tuesdays and fridays , ordinary people become vulnerable to harmful spirits and the evil eye			1
that 's why on those days they stay awake and on their guard until dawn			0
and that is why they get together and smoke			0
" when you exhale the smoke , you send back the evil spells to the sender , " says @entity22 , a @entity23 photographer who has just released a new book of photographs of traditional @entity7 communities			1
" you must also constantly pay homage to the spirits			1
there is a great variety of different spirits , such as the earth mother @entity36 , @entity37 , the god of the underworld , and the @entity40			1
" @entity41 ; @entity42 ; and the @entity40			0
from the point of view of the @entity7 , there is n't an odd one out			0
a blend of animism and @entity48 @entity48 first arrived in the region with the @entity51 colonialists in the 16th century			0
the early missionaries tried to encourage indigenous people to accept the @entity48 @entity42 by reinterpreting their own spirits : @entity36 , they said , was @entity40 , and @entity55 was the devil			1
but the match was largely erroneous			0
unlike the @entity48 gods , the indigenous spirits were not seen as wholly good nor wholly bad			1
they were believed to be capricious yet compassionate ; though they could cause calamities when slighted , they could be powerful allies when appeased			0
moreover , from the point of view of the @entity7 , the terrifying appearance of spirits like @entity55 , who is depicted with horns and a scarlet face , did not simply signify evil			2
rather , it was a reflection of power , which could be used for good or ill. because of these irreconcilable cultural differences ( which the missionaries had failed to appreciate ) , @entity48 gods were simply added into the @entity7 pantheon			0
christian rituals became blended with traditional beliefs , adding another dimension to this colorful , hybrid faith			1
elaborate traditional ceremonies such as @entity82 and the @entity84 carnival , which involve costumes , dancing and singing , are still practiced as they have been since time immemorial			2
but @entity48 saints are included alongside the local deities			1
the paradox of the @entity7 " the aymara people have an approach to life that seems paradoxical from the outside , " says @entity90			1
" in @entity96 you are either one religion or another , either traditional or modern			1
" but in @entity9 people live with both @entity48 and animism , both in modernity and in their ancestral traditions			1
" they visit the @entity102 , the priest , to pay homage to deities or give prophesies when they are applying for visas , or for assistance in businesses matters			2
" despite their acceptance of modernity , the @entity7 also have little truck with the idea that the spirits might not be literally real			2
" traditional stories are seen to be as true as the people talking to you at this moment , " @entity90 explains			1
" if you ask someone if @entity55 , the god of the mines and the underworld , lives , they will say of course because they heard stories about it			0
so myths come to life very strongly in this society			2
" the theater of worship @entity90 first encountered the @entity7 when he was living in @entity9 four years ago			1
there he met his wife - to - be , who is from the @entity7 community , and began to meet her family and wider circle			0
" i found myself entering an alien and beautiful culture , " he says			0
" my parents - in - law would regularly carry out rituals involving offerings of cocoa leaves , alcohol , threads of dyed wool , sugar , and molded figures to the spirits			1
" it was the costumes that particularly impressed him			0
enchanted by the striking masks and outfits worn by shamans and dancers , he headed back to @entity23 and convinced his friend , the photographer @entity155 , to collaborate in a photography project			0
many of the portraits were staged in people 's homes , offering a contrived , theatre - like effect ; others were taken as " snapshots "			2
together , this collection offers a potent evocation of this unusual and thought - provoking way of life			2
" it is extraordinary to see this rich native tradition that challenges @entity171 thinking , " @entity90 says			0
" i think there is much we can learn from them			0
" how some whisky lovers are now making millions @entity176 : the life , death and rebirth of a @entity181 icon biodesign : why the future of our cities is soft and hairy			0

a new book records the extraordinary world of @entity9 spirituality
*catholic* deities are *seamlessly* *incorporated* alongside local spirits
the aymara people live *simultaneously* in modern and traditional societies
every aspect of life is determined by ancient rituals
