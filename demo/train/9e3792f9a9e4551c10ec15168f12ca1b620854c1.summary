a great many filmmakers â € ” too many â € ” use handheld cameras to evoke a sensation of raw , this is really happening immediacy			2
but director @entity6 is unique			1
at a glance , his live - wire , ragged - camera method may seem overly familiar , but the way he employs it , that method is as expressive as the style of a superb novelist			2
the note of authenticity he strikes is n't just about how he holds the camera			2
it 's about what the camera is shooting : @entity6 sets up and stages organically detailed situations that he then films as if he were making a documentary			1
he pioneered that method in " @entity33 " ( 2002 ) , his spectacular drama about the 1972 @entity28 massacre , and he carried it into his two @entity24 ( making the most far - fetched espionage potboilers seem genuine ) and , of course , into @entity31 , the galvanizing post- 9/11 dramatization that let you feel like you were right on board that doomed plane			2
@entity6 keeps you off balance â € ” he 's a jittery poet of reality			1
and he proves that yet again in " @entity40 , " his suspensefully spiky thriller based on a shattering incident from april 2009 , when the crew of a @entity45 cargo ship , the @entity46 , was held hostage for several days by a band of @entity50 pirates armed with machine guns			0
early on , @entity6 echoes what he did in " @entity31 , " letting us peek separately into the lives of both the victims and their attackers before the vehicle in question takes off			1
capt. @entity59 ( @entity60 ) , a veteran merchant mariner , still lives in his native @entity61 , and he 's a plainspoken family man full of anxiety about the economically bleak new world his kids are facing			1
when his wife ( @entity65 ) drops him off at the airport , we can see he reveres her			0
the film then cuts to @entity50 , a land of dust and poverty , where the pirates are recruited for their mission as if they were migrant farmworkers lining up to be chosen for that day 's labor			2
@entity6 does n't have to fill in much about the violent , chaotic breakdown of @entity50 to let us know that these men have little choice in life : taking up arms to steal , or even to kill , is the central option their society has handed them			1
when the giant cargo liner rounds the @entity83 , captain @entity59 realizes he 's in dangerous waters			1
a radar that detects the pirates as they zoom toward the ship on two motorboats gives you a sickening feeling			0
as soon as they climb aboard , evading the spray of water hoses that are the crew 's only '' weapons , '' we know we 're seeing a clash of two cultures : the privileged western world , with its power and bounty ( all symbolized by the vastness of that ship ) , and the desperate quarters of the @entity104 , locked outside the loop of technological progress and hope			0
one of the pirates , a young fellow named @entity110 , is played by @entity111 , who has the ravaged , bone - hungry face of a starving child all grown up			0
that face haunts the movie , and so does @entity111 's extraordinary acting			0
@entity110 is ruthless , forlorn , street - smart , naive ( he wants millions of dollars , even though there 's only $ 30,000 on the ship ) , and even compassionate , all at the same time			0
in dramatic terms , he 's the enemy , yet @entity111 's performance inspires us to ask : how , in the modern world , did the violence @entity110 embodies become part of the family of man ? @entity129 must guard his crew , negotiate with the pirates , and keep his own fears in check , and @entity60 acts with a minimalism that speaks volumes : we 're wired into his every glance			1
@entity59 sends the pirates on a wild goose chase throughout the massive ship , and captain @entity59 becomes a gripping life - or - death chess game : who will survive ? who will outwit whom ? but in the second half , when @entity59 is forced to board an enclosed lifeboat along with the pirates , the film 's suspense begins to ebb			1
it 's not that @entity151 ' electrifying style fails him			0
it 's that the movie , tethered for close to an hour to the strategies and tensions aboard the lifeboat , keeps giving us things to observe , but maybe not so much to discover			0
