-- killing people by lethal injection will soon be as distant a memory as burning heretics at the stake and stoning adulterers -- at least throughout the civilized world			1
no country that employs the death penalty can be admitted to the @entity10 , and the practice dwindles daily			1
but despite the growing worldwide revulsion against this lethal form of punishment , @entity15 and a handful of other states continue to take their places among such paragons as @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 in the club of those who attempt to administer the death penalty as a form of " justice			1
" indeed , @entity15 is way ahead of all other states in the administering of such justice			1
at the end of this month , under the leadership of gov. @entity35 , the state is expected -- if all appeals fail -- to celebrate its 500th judicial killing since our @entity39 in 1976 reinstated the death penalty as a legitimate form of " justice , " despite the fact that an earlier court had determined that the death penalty was " cruel and unusual punishment			1
" death row diary offers a rare glimpse into a morbid world no one doubts that the woman who is scheduled to be executed on wednesday , @entity51 , is guilty of the 1997 murder of her neighbor , a 71 - year - old woman and a retired college professor			1
at the latest count , 1,369 people have been executed since 1976 and 144 people on death row have been exonerated			1
@entity51 will not be exonerated ; so , why should n't we kill her ? for the same reason @entity62 gave to reporters on february 8 , 1924 , the day the official @entity61 was inaugurated with the electrocution of five @entity67 men			1
said @entity62 then , " it just could n't be done , boys			0
a warden ca n't be a warden and a killer , too			0
the penitentiary is a place to reform a man , not to kill him			0
" @entity76 resigned rather than pull the switch			0
sadly , so many others have failed in the many years since then to follow his heroic example			0
and let 's not equivocate : often , and in every age , doing the right thing requires heroism			0
@entity51 is a black woman			1
black people are disproportionately represented on death row , as are blacks imprisoned throughout this country			1
many would say ( at least in a whisper ) that black people are more prone to crime and violence than are white people			1
but as a historian , i know that there was a time , long ago , when my people -- @entity98 - @entity97 -- were deemed to be more prone to crime and violence than were others			1
this was in the years after the potato famines of the 19th century that brought so many desperately poor @entity98 people to these shores			2
the police in @entity106 became so inured to arresting @entity98 that they began to call the van they threw the arrestees into " the @entity110 , " a name that has adhered to that vehicle ever since			0
but who today would care ( or dare ) to make a case for exceptional @entity98 criminality ? the immigrating @entity98 were more prone to criminality not because of some genetic inheritance , but because they were so very poor , so neglected , so abandoned			0
when i see a vagrant today , snoring on a park bench , clothed in rags and stinking , i think to myself : whatever happened to this guy , whatever the history that dropped him on this park bench , no one loved him enough when he was a child			0
his parents , if he had parents , were too taken up with the pain of living , with the struggle for survival , with their own hideous fears , to tend to him adequately , if at all			0
no one came to rescue this child , give him enough to eat , adequate shelter , a caring environment â € ” the love that everyone needs in order to grow			0
we -- the larger society -- have a profound obligation to such people , an obligation we have largely ignored			2
many other societies in the western world devote considerable resources to keeping poor children ( and their parents ) from despair			0
as an @entity67 friend of mine who lives in @entity151 says : " in @entity151 we tax the rich , but everyone is comfortable			0
" not everyone is comfortable in the @entity97			2
many children live below the poverty line , millions of them without enough food or adequate shelter and with almost no attention to their educational needs			0
as for their emotional needs , are you kidding me ? if @entity15 would pay attention to the needs of all its children , if we would all do the same for all our children , if we would only admit that every child needs to be loved and that we are all obliged to help ensure this outcome , our world would change overnight			2
we would certainly not need our electric chairs and nooses and lethal injections			1
we could then say what the poet - priest @entity175 said as long ago as 1623 , " any man 's death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind			2
" any man 's death			2
correction : a percentage referring to death row exonerations was miscalculated in an earlier version of this article			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			2

@entity15 set to carry out its 500th execution . if all appeals fail , @entity51 will die
@entity97 is the only @entity197 nation that still has death penalty , *joins* @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity24
@entity192 : black people much more likely to be sent to prison and to death row
@entity192 : get *rid* of electric chairs , nooses , lethal injections
