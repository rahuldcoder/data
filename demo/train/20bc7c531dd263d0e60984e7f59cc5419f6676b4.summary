@entity0 -- in a symbolic gesture toward more civil political discourse , @entity5 sen. @entity4 and @entity6 sen. @entity6 said sunday they will sit together at the upcoming @entity9 address			1
appearing on the @entity11 's " @entity10 , " @entity4 and @entity6 called for political debate based on issues and ideology , rather than motives and personal attacks , in the aftermath of the @entity19 , @entity20 , shootings last week that killed six people and critically injured @entity5 rep. @entity22			1
@entity4 acknowledged that sitting with @entity6 for the president 's annual speech to @entity25 would be symbolic , " but maybe it just sets a tone and everything gets a little bit more civil			1
" " we believe in discourse in @entity33 , we believe in strenuous discourse , " said @entity4 , who is from @entity30			1
" we do n't sweep differences under the rug			0
@entity6 and i have real differences , but we can do it civilly			1
" asked about the inflammatory political climate , @entity6 rejected portrayals by some conservatives that president @entity44 's agenda is anti-american or intended to harm the country			1
" what we ca n't question is the president 's love for our country , " said @entity6 of @entity46 , later adding : " when we get in trouble is when we question motive rather than ideology			1
" traditionally , @entity5 and @entity54 sit on different sides of the @entity56 for the @entity9 address that also includes @entity59 members , military leaders , the @entity61 and other government officials			2
last week , sen. @entity63 , @entity64 , sent a letter to congressional leaders suggesting that @entity5 and @entity54 sit together for the january 25 speech			2
" as the nation watches , @entity5 and @entity54 should reflect the interspersed character of @entity33 itself , " @entity63 wrote in the letter			2
" perhaps , by sitting with each other for one night , we will begin to rekindle that common spark that brought us here from 50 different states and widely diverging backgrounds to serve the public good			0
" other politicians also supported @entity63 's call			2
" well , i think it 's a symbol , and a symbol is a very good place to start , " @entity5 sen. @entity81 of @entity30 told the @entity83 program " @entity84			0
" " and so if we can actually come into that chamber and instead of me going to the left , i go to the right , and the @entity54 do the opposite , what you 're going to create is an image of the @entity25 deciding that we are going to work as a body , not as two separate sides			2
that 's a very good place to start			0
" @entity95 rep. @entity95 of @entity20 said he expected more civil debate in the wake of the @entity19 shootings , even if the issues and " the substance of the debate " wo n't change			1
" i think that we @entity54 , and i think @entity5 alike , will realize that if we tone down the rhetoric sometimes , our debate is more effective from our own side , " @entity95 said on the @entity83 program			1
however , old habits die hard , @entity95 acknowledged			0
" it 's easy to slip back into old ways , " @entity95 said			0
" i think we can have the debates we need to with a more civil tone			2
and , frankly , i think that we 'll find that that 's more effective from both sides			0
but keeping that into the future is going to be a tough thing			0
" on the same program , outgoing @entity5 gov. @entity116 of @entity117 said a change in the hyper - partisan political discourse is necessary			1
asked about the biggest changes during his two terms in office that end this week , @entity116 said : " in my eight years , i 've seen the level of partisanship and ideological posturing just increase and increase and increase and i think it 's tearing the fabric of our government apart			0
" rep. @entity130 , @entity131 , said the tone may change , but not the intensity			1
" i do n't plan to debate my values and the principles of my constituents any less vigorously , " she said on the @entity83 program			0
" but i think it starts with us , and we have to lead by example			0
and so i think all of us need to be more careful about the words that we choose to use			0

new : tone of debate should change , not intensity , politicians say
*democrat* @entity4 , @entity54 @entity6 want to symbolize civil discourse
@entity4 says the the move may help tone down the rhetoric
@entity6 says question ideology , not motives , of political foes
