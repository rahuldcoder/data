@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity1 court monday refused to intervene in the case of bishop @entity5 , who is facing prosecution for denying the @entity7 -- a crime in @entity1			1
bishop @entity5 , shown in the recent @entity9 tv interview , has been removed from his seminary post in @entity11			1
@entity5 asked the court to order @entity12 to restrict broadcast of an interview in which he doubts the existence of @entity17 gas chambers and a systematic @entity17 plan to annihilate @entity19			1
@entity5 sought the help of the court because holocaust denial is punishable in @entity1 only if it is publicized there			1
the court refused the request , it announced monday			0
his lawyers argued that giving an interview to a @entity9 television station did not constitute denying the @entity7 in @entity1 -- although he was physically in the country when he made the remarks			1
@entity5 hit the headlines last month when he and three other ultra-conservative bishops were welcomed back into the @entity32 , more than 20 years after @entity29 excommunicated them on a theological question unrelated to the @entity7			2
the state court of @entity35 ruled that the bishop would have had to notify @entity9 reporters of any restrictions before the interview			1
according to the court , @entity5 also wanted the interview removed from the network 's web site			1
the court said it is clear that the @entity9 network is available on satellite in many countries and that he knew they had a web site which can be seen around the world			2
a @entity1 district attorney announced february 4 that he had launched a criminal investigation against @entity5 on january 23			2
@entity54 district attorney @entity53 said authorities are investigating whether his remarks can be considered " inciting racial hatred			0
" denying the @entity7 in @entity1 is punishable by up to five years in prison			2
" i believe that the historical evidence is strongly against -- is hugely against -- six million @entity63 having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of @entity66 , " @entity5 said in the interview , which also appeared on various web sites after broadcast			1
" i believe there were no gas chambers			0
" @entity5 and three other bishops who belong to the @entity70 were excommunicated in 1988			2
the society was founded by archbishop @entity72 , who rebelled against the @entity74 's modernizing reforms in the 1960s , and who consecrated the men in unsanctioned ceremonies			0
the rehabilitation of @entity5 sparked harsh condemnation from @entity80 , @entity82 @entity63 leaders and @entity1 chancellor @entity83 , among others			1
the @entity74 has pointed to several statements by pope @entity86 in the past few years condemning the destruction of @entity19 , including his visits to concentration camps			0
he has also said he did not know of @entity5 's views on the @entity7 when he lifted the excommunication			2
the @entity74 has said @entity5 will not be allowed to perform priestly functions until he recants his holocaust denial			1
he has apologized for " distress " his remarks caused the pope , but he has not retracted them			0
on sunday , @entity83 phoned pope @entity86 about the issue , though neither side seemed to have shifted its position over @entity5			0
in addition , @entity5 was removed over the weekend as head of a seminary in @entity11			0
the views of @entity5 , who has led the seminary in @entity108 since 2003 , do not reflect those of @entity109 , said @entity110 , head of its @entity82 chapter			0
@entity110 said , in effect , @entity5 had no business discussing the @entity7 issue			0
" it 's obvious that a catholic bishop can not talk with the ecclesiastical authority but to things related to faith and morality , " @entity110 said in a written statement .			0

he told @entity9 tv he did not believe there was a @entity17 plan to wipe out @entity63
he wanted @entity9 tv to be *banned* from airing interview in @entity1 or on internet
