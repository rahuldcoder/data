@entity0 -- @entity4 can force @entity6 aides to testify under subpoena , a @entity3 @entity2 ruled thursday , rejecting @entity9 administration claims of immunity			1
former white house counsel @entity12 is not immune from congressional subpoenas , a judge ruled thursday			1
the @entity14 has been seeking to force former white house counsel @entity12 to testify before @entity4 about the firing of nine @entity3 attorneys in 2006			1
the @entity6 has been resisting , claiming she can not be compelled to appear			2
but the @entity6 position " is without any support in case law , " judge @entity18 wrote in a 93 - page opinion released thursday			1
he said the notion that " @entity12 is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process " is " unprecedented			2
" but , @entity18 added , the ruling does not mean that @entity12 and @entity26 , the @entity6 chief of staff from whom @entity6 @entity27 have demanded @entity6 documents , could not assert executive privilege during congressional testimony			1
the court " resolves , and again rejects " the notion that senior @entity6 aides are absolutely immune from subpoena , but the " specific claims of executive privilege that ms. @entity12 and mr. @entity26 may assert are not addressed -- and the court expresses no view on such claims , " @entity18 wrote			1
in a hearing in june , @entity18 had urged the @entity6 and @entity4 to resolve their dispute via negotiations			1
he also expressed concern the clock would run out because he expected an appeal of his ruling no matter which way he decided			0
that could keep the dispute in the courts until a new @entity4 is elected in november			2
the subpoenas expire when this @entity4 leaves office			1
rep. @entity53 , an @entity55 @entity54 and the @entity6 minority leader , appeared to agree on thursday			0
" i 'm sure it 'll be appealed and it 'll go on into next year and it 'll become a moot issue , " he said			0
rep. @entity60 of @entity61 , the senior @entity54 on the @entity14 , called the ruling a " victory for @entity4 , " but urged congressional @entity27 and the administration to " seek a reasonable compromise " rather than continue to fight the matter in court			2
the @entity14 filed suit against @entity12 and @entity26 in march after the @entity68 said it would not pursue contempt charges against them for failing to obey the subpoena			2
the @entity6 has insisted the firings of the nine @entity3 attorneys were legal			0
but @entity27 said the central questions behind the dismissals -- who decided the prosecutors should be ousted , and why -- remain unanswered			0
the position is supposed to be an apolitical one			0
@entity27 accuse the administration of political motives in replacing the nine officials			0
@entity6 press secretary @entity83 said the administration is reviewing thursday 's ruling			0
house speaker @entity86 , a @entity88 @entity87 , said she was " pleased " by the ruling , though she said had not had a chance to study it .			0
