@entity0 , @entity1 -- from @entity4 , the sun appears as a constant circle of light , but when viewed in space a brilliant display of motion is revealed			1
flares that light up the galaxy and eruptions that can be as large as 30 times the @entity4 's surface occur regularly			0
during the peak of the 11 - year solar cycle , these events can happen several times a day			2
the flares and eruptions are collectively known as space weather and although they create dazzling visuals in space , it is n't just a harmless fireworks show for the galaxy			0
each burst of energy can have a disrupting effect on systems we rely on every day			0
with their headquarters next to the @entity29 in the state of @entity1 , a team of forecasters aims to minimize that impact			0
" the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) essentially watches the sun , watches for activity on the sun originating from sun spots , " explains @entity36 , @entity38 lead			1
" that 's really where the magnetic fields of the sun poke through the surface and kind of hold that part of the surface in place allowing it to cool -- that 's why it appears dark			1
" gas rolls up and down the sun 's outer layer , similar to the bubbles in boiling water			0
when the magnetic field around a sun spot breaks , magnetic energy explodes in the solar atmosphere like a pot boiling over			1
the size and position of sun spots can give forecasters a clue as to when or where a solar flare may bubble up			1
they produce daily forecasts that are important to the industries most vulnerable			0
" space weather can have a variety of impacts across many different customer bases -- commercial aviation , precision gps use , power grid operations -- all these are really critical , " says @entity36			1
read this : capturing the cosmos -- stunning photos of the night sky the sun is currently at its " solar maximum " -- the point in its cycle where it is at peak activity -- but the @entity39 says that activity is modest compared to recent cycles			1
nonetheless , last week the center reported that the sun had produced a " moderate - level " solar flare , which had " short - lived impacts to high frequency radio communications on the sunlit side of @entity4			1
" solar flares can send blasts of radiation through space that can interfere with satellites and even harm astronauts during spacewalks			2
" so when an eruption happens -- when we have that flash of light , those radio waves -- that takes eight minutes to get from the sun to the @entity4			2
so as soon as we start the measurement , it 's already affecting the sunlit side of the @entity4 , " explains @entity36			0
innovations in spacecraft by @entity113 are showing us some of the best images of the sun we 've ever seen -- giving us a clearer picture and hopefully a better understanding of space weather			2
but there is still much mystery to the 4.5 billion - year - old star and the emissions that are blasted through space , so scientists and forecasters will continue to watch every movement			0

@entity39 watches skies for solar activity
*coronal* mass *ejections* can disrupt satellites and power grids
the sun is at its " solar maximum " -- but its activity is described as " modest "
