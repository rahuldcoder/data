-- in many cases it 's a woman that grips the blade -- maybe clean , maybe dirty -- that cuts a girl 's path to womanhood			1
@entity11 president @entity10 wants to ban the practice of female circumcision in his country			1
the cutter , who works for a fee , can pursue any number of surgical options for the young girl 's rite of passage			1
she can remove the girl 's clitoris entirely , narrow her vagina with stitches , or make other excisions of the girl 's genitalia			1
a traditional symbol of a child 's maturity to womanhood , the girl undergoes a circumcision			1
often without an anesthetic , she feels every slice			0
and sometimes girls that become women under the knife die under it , too			0
in @entity11 , president @entity10 wants to outlaw female circumcision , and those that continue to perform the bloody practice would face the death penalty if a girl dies as a result of the procedure , press secretary @entity43 told @entity0 wednesday			1
" if a girl dies during circumcision that would be murder , " @entity43 said			1
" the punishment for murder in @entity11 is death			1
" @entity10 's move to ban female circumcision is in line with other countries and organizations that have sought to decrease the prevalence of female circumcision , also known as female genital cutting or female genital mutilation			1
the practice involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia and creates scar tissue that can cause complications during labor			2
but in nearby @entity74 and @entity75 , where female genital mutilation is illegal , the practice is still rampant because people are not sensitized to the health consequences of circumcision and laws are not enforced , said @entity82 , an @entity83 @entity11 researcher			1
while @entity83 does not support the death penalty , @entity82 said the group wants to see @entity11 ban the practice			1
he worries it wo n't be done , though , because @entity11 has a " mixed " track record on enacting laws to protect women , he said			2
@entity43 , however , said he thinks that with the president 's support behind it , @entity11 's parliament will outlaw the ancient ritual			1
rooted in paternalistic culture and practiced for centuries , female circumcision in @entity11 is thought to protect a girl 's chastity by " reducing the urge for sex in women , " @entity43 said			1
in @entity11 , female genital mutilation is popular among tribes that live near the eastern border with @entity74 , @entity43 said			1
he said he does not know how many female circumcisions have occurred in @entity11 nor how many girls have died from them			1
the @entity110 and @entity111 tribes are the primary adherents to the custom of female circumcision , he said			2
the tribes , he said , make up less than 10 percent of the country 's population , which the @entity117 estimated at 29.9 million in 2006			0
the @entity118 estimates that 100 million to 140 million girls and women have been circumcised			0
another 3 million girls are at risk of being circumcised each year , the organization says			0
the practice is extremely painful and traumatizing , and can result in prolonged bleeding , a higher risk of hiv infection , infertility and even death , according to the @entity130			0
the cultural practice occurs in parts of @entity133 , @entity134 , the @entity135 and in some immigrant communities in @entity137 and @entity138 , with the majority of those who have undergone the procedure living in 28 countries across @entity133 , according to the @entity143			1
mostly women perform the circumcisions on girls ranging in age from infancy to 15 , the @entity130 said			0
in some cultures , women endure repeated circumcisions			0
those that do the cutting in @entity11 earn an income on the procedure , @entity43 said			2
what once was done for free and deemed a privilege to perform now rakes in less than $ 1 per girl , @entity43 said			0
even for a country that the @entity117 reported as having 53 percent of people living on $ 1.25 or less a day , " it was not big money , " he said			0
" poverty is quite a big factor and directly intrinsically linked to the economic interest [ in female circumcision ] , " @entity82 said			2
@entity10 proposes to distribute money to the practitioners to give them financial support until they find other work , @entity43 said			2
the money could come in the form of a low - interest rate loan , he said			0
governments and local leaders must promote other ways to earn an income to successfully outlaw female circumcision , said @entity143 spokesman @entity176			1
tribal leaders , especially , must insist on alternatives to the cutting ceremony , such as gifts , he said			0
while referred to as a rite of passage , the cutting also subjugates women to a chastity reinforced by scars and a culture that dictates that circumcised girls are more attractive to prospective husbands			0
" very often it 's the mother of the girl who takes her daughter to be cut			2
you know the reason ? " @entity176 asked			0
" because she feels , ' @entity196 , my daughter wo n't get a husband if i do n't cut her			0
" @entity199 's mother took her to be circumcised when she was 13			0
the @entity201 native said she felt " tricked into it by a person that was supposed to protect me -- my own mother			0
" @entity207 , now 47 , in 1994 released a movie detailing the practice , " @entity210			0
" when the activist heard that @entity10 wants to outlaw female circumcision , it brought back memories of her own experience of being " stitched like a curtain , " she said			1
" i thought of my first pain as a child of 13 and realizing this was not really love ; this was not a gift of womanhood , " she said			2
@entity199 , who received corrective surgery and has helped other women get corrective surgery , is writing a memoir about her trials as a " survivor " of female genital mutilation and the struggles to reconcile with a family that shunned her after she spoke out against the practice			1
she said that speaking out against female circumcision is not a betrayal of culture , it is a public acknowledgment of what is right and what is wrong			2
for @entity10 , it is a movement toward modernity			0
" you must grow out of that culture that is not supported by scientific information , " @entity10 says in a statement posted on his web site .			0
