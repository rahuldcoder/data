three years ago , a woman gave birth to premature triplets in a small village clinic in the @entity4			1
the doctors were not equipped to provide the medical care these tiny patients required , so the parents were told the babies would simply be left to die			2
but the triplets ' father had heard about a new , state - of - the - art hospital just up the road built by @entity4 @entity16 and former @entity15 star @entity14			1
the father begged the doctors to call the @entity16			2
" so they called me , and they said , ' mr. @entity14 , there 's three babies coming from one person			1
can we take them ? the man does n't work ; the wife does n't work			0
' i said , ' please , make them live			0
' " @entity14 says that phone call is just one example of why he decided to open a hospital in his hometown of @entity32			1
built with funds raised through his @entity35 , the hospital bears the name of his mother , @entity38 , who he says taught him the importance of helping others			1
" for everything she did for her children and for her family , the value of love and giving back and sharing			0
not just with you , not just with your family , but with the people you encounter in life , with your community , and that was the kind of love that my mom gave			2
" according to an @entity57 study , 5.4 million people have died from war - related causes in the @entity4 since 1998 , making it the deadliest conflict since @entity61 sadly , the outpouring of love taught by @entity14 's mother was cut short when his parents ' city came under attack in 1998			1
@entity14 says that after shooting in the streets , soldiers enforced a curfew and prevented his father from taking his ailing mother to a nearby hospital			1
about an hour later , his beloved mother died in her living room			0
for @entity14 , his mom was no less a victim than if she had been shot herself			1
she 's just one of the millions who have died in this civil war whose deaths , he believes , were preventable			1
" there was people who was n't killed by the gunfight , but they were denied access to the health care , " he said			0
" if there was no chaos in the capital city of @entity32 , my mom would be alive			0
" she had no reason to die			0
" @entity14 hopes his hospital will help provide medical care desperately needed in the @entity4			1
he says the hospital has treated more than 30,000 patients and employs nearly 400 doctors and nurses			1
and those triplets ? they spent more than three months on life - saving machines and now are thriving toddlers			1
the parents were so grateful that they named the babies after the 7 - foot , 2 - inch basketball player			0
@entity14 laughed as he recalled the story			2
" the guy said , ' you saved my babies			0
so your family gets all the names			0
' and i said , ' but they 're going to get confused on the street one day and think they 're my kids ! ' " @entity14 's hospital also hired the triplets ' father as a sanitation worker so the family can afford to pay for the care their children need			1
" you 're talking about impact			0
that 's the impact that we are making , " @entity14 said with a smile			2
" we are touching lives			0
we are changing the living conditions of the people			0
" he says the next issue he wants to tackle in the @entity4 is education			2
" half of the population in @entity131 right now is under the age of 15 years old , " @entity14 said			2
" but we are not finding the time to educate those people because of the violence			0
" in the next few years , @entity14 hopes to build a school in the @entity4 village where his parents grew up			1
he says he will name the school in memory of his father , who devoted his entire career to education .			0
