@entity0 , @entity1 -- after emerging from the rubble of @entity7 's @entity6 palace late in august , @entity3 seized control as the military commander of @entity0			1
an islamist who had taken little public part in the spring uprising against @entity7 , he claimed his soldiers had won the symbolic battle for the palace , the heart of the @entity1 strongman 's regime			1
by taking control of @entity0 , @entity3 gained authority over a third of the country 's population and a major slice of its wealth			1
it was a power play that other opposition fighters bitterly resented			0
@entity29 , one of several rival commanders , claims his fighters endured far tougher and more significant battles than the siege of @entity7 's palace , not least the struggle to win control of @entity0 's main international airport that lasted several days			1
in an interview with @entity2 he downplayed @entity3 's success and threatened confrontation , as internal divisions threaten to pull apart the coalition that brought @entity7 down			1
" who is @entity44 and who appointed him ? " @entity29 asks			1
" we do n't know him			0
we are the leaders , we are the revolutionists , we know everything			0
" @entity29 echoes a much wider complaint that @entity3 is actually a stooge of the @entity50			1
" we know that @entity44 was in a school and @entity50 sends him money to buy weapons , " he said			1
in @entity0 today it 's a commonly held belief that @entity3 's @entity55 is getting direct funding from @entity50			1
these concerns come amid reports that a @entity60 delegation traveled to @entity50 last week to raise the issue			1
@entity50 has been a principal player in pushing the revolution forward as part of the @entity60 alliance			1
now there 's growing unease in the @entity1 capital that fractures among the groups controlling the country could have roots in divisions among the international coalition that overthrew @entity7			1
@entity3 , also known by his @entity74 , @entity75 , was the military leader of the @entity76 , @entity76 , and denies any nefarious ties to @entity50			1
but @entity1 's rumor mill quickly turns suspicion into fact and he is finding it hard to shake the slur			1
his @entity76 began fighting @entity7 in the 1980s			0
after @entity7 successfully crushed the @entity76 , the group went underground and scattered			0
at its peak , the @entity76 had underground cells in more than 20 countries , including @entity86 , where it shared training camps with @entity89			0
@entity3 had joined the new revolution with a ready - made army and a political religious ideology to boot			1
i know this because in 2009 i was trying to interview him when he was an inmate inside the notorious @entity96 jail in @entity0			2
in his writings then , he was trying to lead the group away from violent jihad towards a more political ideology			0
the so - called recantation theories , a 400 - page manifesto he and several other fighting group leaders wrote from within the walls of the high security prison was the first ever direct jihadist challenge to @entity108 's nihilistic ideology			2
@entity108 and @entity3 had never been natural bedfellows , but now they were enemies			2
still , none of this cuts the mustard in @entity0 today ; he 's just another leader with an agenda			1
@entity7 himself predicted his detractors had little in common and would soon fight among themselves			0
sure enough , as weeks of street uprisings dragged out into months of @entity60 bombing , fractures appeared			0
@entity120 , @entity7 's old ally and military chief who deserted him for the rebels was murdered in suspicious circumstances			2
many feared it was the handiwork of the @entity126 cutting down a moderate who might have made deals with some of his former boss 's friends			2
today the fight is a war of words played out in the newly liberated conference halls of the capital			0
at the weekend , @entity138 ( @entity138 ) chairman @entity137 tried to reconcile the growing differences			0
after a contentious group meeting with all the commanders , the atmosphere became so heated that he was forced to meet the next day with individual factions seperately			0
on the capital 's streets , the power struggle has more sinister overtones			2
first , @entity3 , citing the @entity137 and the @entity138 's backing , called for all heavy weapons to be put under his command or moved out of the city			1
" we call on all the revolutionary brigades and small local councils to join this framework as acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the transitional council , " he said			2
it is statements like this that rankle with @entity29			2
@entity29 claims it is his group , the @entity162 , that has the authority to have the weapons rounded up			1
legitimacy in the capital , he says , is garnered from the neighborhood councils established to funnel weapons to fighters before the final push to over throw @entity7			2
but his challenge extends beyond @entity3 to the @entity138 and @entity137 , the man who many regard as the very glue holding the disparate groups together			2
" we gave this council the legitimacy and if we want we can withdraw the legitimacy from the transitional council ...			0
then we have no problem with withdrawing its legitimacy , " @entity29 said			1
the root of the problem is that many @entity1 's are loyal to family , tribe , village and town before nation			1
they 've fought often isolated in their towns , @entity192 in the western mountains , @entity194 under siege on the coast for 6 months and @entity197 , its own large fiefdom in the east			0
@entity0 's patchwork of neighborhood councils is but a minor mirror of that			1
@entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 -- to name but a few -- saw many of the weapons smuggled in to the city over the summer			0
it 's given them muscle and the power to punch above their weight , as well as some freedom to choose sides			0
@entity3 claims many are loyal to him			2
" we have met with all the local revolutionary councils and other small councils and we have agreed on a written statement we will show it to media soon , " he claimed			0
trouble is @entity29 claims loyalty from some of the same councils			2
meanwhile , the overnight thump of heavy guns being fired off for fun across many of @entity0 's neighborhoods has dwindled			1
but no - one here is fooled that they 've gone silent for good			0
tensions are leading to uncertainty			0
no - one wants to be boxed in like they were with @entity7 , lives bounded by parameters			0
revolution has given a taste of freedom and the capital 's citizens desperately want that seductive flavor on tap for good , enshrined in a genuine democracy before @entity126 or anyone else starts taking their choices away			0
when the men in uniforms with guns and not the politicians in suits start to argue , people get afraid			0
both @entity3 and @entity29 say they want to resolve their differences by talking			1
but over the past few weeks since @entity7 's family fled his @entity260 palace , misunderstanding and distrust have grown			0
reversing it is proving to be a formidable challenge .			0

rival commander @entity29 contests @entity3 's legitimacy
@entity29 has echoed a complaint that @entity3 is a stooge of the @entity50
