-- @entity1 , a 26 - year old from @entity3 , makes for an unlikely @entity5 national hero			1
until a year ago the basketball player had not even set foot in the small @entity9 country , but since helping the national team to their biggest ever international sporting success last month , he 's become one of @entity5 's favorite adopted sons			1
@entity1 was instrumental in @entity5 's fourth - place finish , their highest ever , at the @entity18 championships in @entity19			1
if not quite " @entity28 , " he 's since been given the moniker " @entity21 " by wags in the local media , who quickly picked up on the unprecedented fervor the team 's wins created across the country			1
" the team was greeted in @entity32 as if they had won the golden medal , " remembers 32 - year - old @entity29 , a resident of @entity5 's capital			1
" lots of people went out on the streets on a working day , singing , banging their drums and cheering like never before			0
" were you there ? send in your photos and videos of @entity5 although not a sports fan , @entity29 realized what an impact the international exposure had on the country 's self image and the boost it gave the population			1
" @entity5 was mentioned more times in a single basketball game on international tv than during its whole 20 years of existence since its independence , " said @entity29			2
@entity1 's part in this unlikely national celebration began just a year ago			2
after graduating from the @entity58 , @entity1 was ignored by @entity60 teams and moved to @entity61 , playing for teams in @entity63 , @entity64 and now in @entity65 for @entity66			1
it was while in @entity64 in 2010 that he caught the attention of @entity69 , the secretary general of the @entity70			0
each national team in @entity61 is allowed a naturalized player and @entity69 saw @entity1 as a key addition to a team that had been steadily improving for six years			1
" usually you need to take a few months to check the personality , to check the qualities and character ... with @entity79 we were without worries , " he said			0
" a few times we went out for coffee and colas and we were soon laughing at jokes ; he was @entity5 after two weeks already , " added @entity69			0
@entity1 spends a month each year training with the @entity5 national squad and admits to only knowing " the bad stuff " when it comes to speaking the language			1
it was a surprise to get a call from @entity69 , he admits , but unconcerned by any culture shock ( or loss of @entity95 citizenship ) he also saw the chance to represent @entity5 as a way to boost his own career			0
" i talked to a lot of older players and they said you can play longer with a ( @entity61 ) passport ; i did n't even think about it , i just said yes			0
" for @entity69 , @entity5 's adventure at @entity18 was " one magical story , " but he is realistic when it comes to the future for the team that he says remains underfunded and lacks adequate government backing			1
" it 's very hard to work only with enthusiasm but without money			0
people think you just need a few balls , shoes and jerseys			0
now is the time to either go forward or just survive year by year , " he said			0
qualification for next year 's @entity121 would be even better than this year 's success , says @entity69 , but the way in which the team 's heroics brought about something like national unity was something more valuable than a boost to @entity5 's sporting profile			1
@entity5 gained independence from @entity132 relatively peacefully in 1991 , but the country has been beset by internal tensions between @entity136 and @entity137 ethnic groups			2
country profile : @entity5 in 2001 the country was racked by months of violence between extremist groups from the country 's ethnic communities and the @entity5 military			1
" i 'm happy that during @entity18 lots of congratulations came from ethic @entity146 and @entity137 , " said @entity69			0
" it makes me proud , because it 's like we 're making something forward in the development of unity of the country			0
" the basketball celebrations also gave @entity155 reasons to be hopeful for a more harmonious @entity5			1
" the day when @entity5 was playing @entity156 for the bronze ( medal ) a friend of mine had posted on @entity161 that he had heard his young @entity163 neighbors cheering for the @entity5 team , " said @entity29			2
" i remember his @entity161 status saying ' there is hope for this place after all ... ' " staying out of politics , @entity69 is determined to bring more success to the country by nurturing the best talent wherever it comes from -- mccalebb aside			0
" it 's time to stop the divisions ; we are all @entity5 , " he said			2
" it 's a question of when @entity163 basketball players , or even a coach , play with the national team			2
it will be not because he is @entity163 , but because he is good			0
" correction : an earlier published version of this article incorrectly stated @entity1 attended @entity185 , not @entity58			0
