-- sometimes on a summer evening , i 'll step out into the warm air as darkness descends around me			2
as my eyes adjust to the dimming sky , i 'll look across the street and see a flicker from behind the all - but - dead apple tree			2
just one small glimmer in the spreading gloom			2
it 's joined by another and another until the yard is twinkling with fireflies			1
it 's not enough light to read by , but it 's enough to know i 'm not alone			1
that 's how it felt to share my story of living with depression a while back			1
my tale was in no way remarkable , and i lead a fairly lucky life -- but it 's also all i have ever known			1
from time to time , a gray layer of sadness drapes over me and muffles my capacity to feel joy			1
it 's just the way i 'm built			1
i may never be able to reduce the intensity or frequency of these bouts , but with time , experience , therapy and the love of some extraordinary people , i have learned that the blanket will eventually lift and i 'll be able to feel alive again			1
again -- i am lucky			2
@entity40 struggle to find help for mental health issues moments after my story published , e-mails , @entity47 messages , comments , texts , tweets , calls -- from colleagues , friends and perfect strangers -- flooded in and swallowed me up			2
many @entity0 readers saw my beacon and winked back , sharing their own stories : " perhaps the worst part is how depression makes you hate yourself , no matter what you do			1
if you help someone out of a jam , you did n't do enough			2
if you ca n't help someone , you are n't good enough			2
i look around me at the life i live			2
i make good money , i have a good job , my wife is great , i have traveled the world , and i have a little daughter that is a ray of sunshine in my life			0
how in the world could i be depressed when i have what so many others in the world would love to have ? " but , then there are times that the sky clears up , and life is just good			0
i feel comfortable with myself , and am at peace			1
i think it has happened maybe a half dozen times in my life			0
but , it does happen			0
for anyone suffering through depression , try to remember that the lives of those around you are better for knowing you			1
" -- @entity92 " the full blown version - the kind that is truly physiological and for which no medications have any effect - is witheringly exhausting , both physically and mentally			0
... people have no idea the immense burden that you are carrying and you are judged as if you are normal			1
" -- @entity102 " for me , it 's not ' feeling sad ' ; it 's like i ca n't feel anything -- just emotionless , tired , dull , uninterested in everything			1
if it gets bad , i feel like everything has slowed down and i ca n't peel myself off the bed			1
i 've been actively suicidal multiple times			0
but like the author of this essay i 've found that it is easier to be open about it than to hide it as though it 's a guilty secret			1
" -- @entity116 emotional eating : @entity119 cakes tackle depression taboo despite the pain in our voices , i 'd still count us all among the incredibly fortunate for having the freedom to talk about depression and a language with which to do so			1
not everyone has that freedom of communication as part of their arsenal			0
in particular , children , members of the military and some minority populations can find it difficult to speak about or get help for depression symptoms , often because of cultural taboos or lack of information			1
children and adolescents ( as i was when i was diagnosed ) simply might not understand that there is a name for what they 're feeling or have the language to articulate it to someone who might help			0
according to the @entity151 , 11 % of adolescents suffer from a depressive disorder by age 18 , and that is heavily skewed toward girls			0
the @entity156 reports that young people are likely to mask their their depression in behavior that simply seems like sulking , shyness , reluctance to go to school , clinging to a parent or pretending to be physically ill. older adolescents may act out negatively or attempt to numb the pain through substance abuse			1
because so many of these are pretty standard markers of growing pains , the behavior is often dismissed as " just a phase , " and kids are punished or tolerated but not treated			0
according to the @entity156 , suicide is the third leading cause of death among people 15 - 24			1
sufferers of post-traumatic stress disorder , especially those who serve in the military , often feel isolated upon return from a tour of duty and do n't wish to burden their loved ones with their pain and the horror of what they 've seen			1
according to @entity190 data , 2012 saw a 22 % increase in active - duty suicides , and in a study of 72 active - duty service members who had attempted to commit suicide , every single respondent selected " to stop bad feelings " as part of the reasoning for their attempt			0
" that is an epidemic			0
something 's wrong , " defense secretary @entity201 told @entity202 after the figures were released in july			1
army sgt. maj. @entity205 believes the key is for senior military personnel to lead by example and share their own stories of @entity210 , brain injury and suicidal thoughts			1
" it is a source of strength to ask for help , " @entity205 told participants in a @entity215 roundtable discussion on the issue			0
" and we are all about being strong in the @entity190			0
" he continued , " our ultimate goal is to change mindset across the force , build resilience , strengthen life - coping skills and address the stigma associated with asking for help			0
we 've got a long ways to go , but we 're going to get there			0
" and in some cultures , the subject of depression is simply taboo			1
@entity232 , author of " @entity233 : it just looks like we 're not hurting , " says the silence is destroying the @entity236 - @entity236 community			0
@entity232 suffered a severe emotional breakdown not long after launching a public relations company with high - profile clients like @entity240 , @entity241 and a who 's - who of modern musical acts			1
as part of her recovery , she makes it her mission to ensure that people around her feel empowered to speak uncomfortable truths and get the professional help they need			1
" black folks tend to see mental illness as a character flaw , a sign of weakness , because we are a very faith - based people			1
many are of the opinion that you just take whatever it is to the @entity262 in prayer , " @entity232 says			0
but that 's just the first step			1
" i speak at a lot of churches , and i say , ' i know it was my @entity269 that led me to the right psychiatrist			0
' " this reticence to seek help , she says , leads to some deeply destructive behavior			0
" not enough of us are recognizing it or getting help			0
we 'll do anything we can not to feel the real pain			1
we drink , use drugs , buy things we do n't need , have promiscuous , unprotected sex , gamble , create violence -- it 's everywhere			1
... and people commit slow suicide : they do n't take their diabetes medication , or they go into enemy territory where they know they 'll get shot			2
" @entity232 combats this with a packed touring schedule , addressing groups of @entity236 adolescents and professionals , speaking about her own experiences in an attempt to draw out people who may have experienced some of the same feelings and who may have never acknowledged it aloud -- let alone in front of a group of 700 people			1
and it works , she says			0
in one instance , a young woman came up to the podium in tears and spoke of sexual abuse from multiple relatives			0
three other young women stood up and said that they had been raped			0
it was the first time they ever uttered it out loud , and as @entity232 says , " each left there a different person			0
" in another case , @entity232 found herself counseling two members of the @entity321 street gang who , to her great surprise , opened up with their issues of abandonment and fatherlessness , wept at her desk for over four hours and then went back and " started running around talking to their homies about the benefits of therapy			0
" the initial breakthrough is an extraordinary thing , but @entity232 admits that aftercare resources may be harder to come by in some communities			2
she suggests seeking therapists with a sliding scale and seeking out one of the growing number of counseling offices attached to local churches -- and she 's deputizing clergy members to take action			2
@entity232 convinced one minister to slip the phrase , " when i was at my therapist 's office ... " into his sunday sermon			2
that , she says , normalizes the language and the notion			0
if your preacher is saying that he can not handle the weight of the world by himself , laypeople may be more open to the notion that they do n't have to either			0
" when you share your story with someone else , " @entity232 says , " you find that you 're not standing on that ledge by yourself			2
" @entity0 commenter mobustobus expressed a similar sentiment : " emotional honesty is almost like a taboo in our society , but it 's essential for healing depression			1
opening up to another human being and telling them your deepest , darkest secrets is one of the scariest things you can do , but also one of the most empowering			0
the first time i did it , i felt alive in a way i had never before felt in my life			0
there 's definitely an energy you get from baring it all and realizing you 're still accepted			2
" resources : @entity383 help yourself			2
