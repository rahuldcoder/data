" i thought , ' this is not an @entity28 i know , ' " the 29 - year - old school administrator said in a phone interview			2
" this is not what @entity28 should be			2
" since august 9 , @entity7 the place has come to represent what many see as the ugly side of @entity28 racial politics , making @entity7 the hashtag a social media shorthand for racial inequality , police misconduct and " the value of black life , " @entity1 said			1

these conversations happen every day across @entity28 amid tension between law enforcement and black communities , said @entity54 , executive director of civil rights group @entity55			2
@entity7 became a national conversation thanks to social media , creating an opening for broader discussions about " inequality in the criminal justice system , " he said			1
@entity7 has always been about justice for @entity3 first and foremost , @entity54 said			1
it has also become a signifier of " a bigger problem in our country where for some of us justice does n't seem like it will ever be delivered , " he said			0
" we 're talking about the larger issue of police misconduct in @entity7 and around the country that happens everyday , " he said			2

" there are many of us who are voices in this and that is our power			0
" turning a moment into a movement hashtags like # @entity7 are a means to an end for advocacy groups trying to create movements out of moments like @entity3 's shooting , said @entity54 with @entity55			1
" our role is to translate what 's happening in @entity7 to everyday people who want to do something on a systemic level that will lead to lasting change , " he said			1
" what we 're doing is trying to capture that energy and push for national change in terms of policies that incentivize better policing and hold media and @entity157 accountable in terms of the images and implicit biases they put out in the world			0
" the hashtag creates a space for people to see what 's happening on the ground not only in @entity7 but in places around country , he said			1
hopefully , what they see engages and catalyzes them into activism in real life			0
" a hashtag provides a meeting space , a virtual meeting space where you can be virtually tapped into one strand of what 's happening , " he said			0
" but it 's a mistake to believe you 're fully educated			0
