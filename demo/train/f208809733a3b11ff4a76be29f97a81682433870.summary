-- with the strength of @entity4 's forces diminishing in @entity6 's civil war , global fears are mounting that @entity6 might unleash chemical weapons to quash the country 's uprising			1
the government insists it would never use chemical weapons on its own people			1
but world leaders say @entity6 's desperation could lead to even more tragedy in the war - torn country			1
so what exactly are chemical weapons , and what could they do to the human body ? a primer : -- what kinds of weapons are we talking about ? military analysts believe @entity6 may have one of the largest stockpiles of chemical weapons in the world			1
specifically , the supply could include sarin , mustard and vx gases			1
@entity36 intelligence indicates @entity6 has mixed chemical compounds needed to make sarin -- a deadly agent that can quickly kill thousands			1
opinion : do n't wait for @entity6 to cross the ' red line ' -- how do these chemicals affect the body ? sarin gas is an odorless nerve agent that can cause convulsions , paralysis and respiratory failure			1
nerve agents are the most toxic and rapidly acting of the known chemical warfare agents , according to the @entity52			0
@entity53 quickly evaporates from liquid to vapor form and disperse into the environment			0
it also mixes easily with water and can poison a water supply			0
@entity60 is another nerve agent that can be lethal when inhaled			0
it can also be dispersed in a liquid form ; even a few small drops on the skin can lead to the same effects as sarin gas			1
" compared with the nerve agent sarin ( also known as @entity53 ) , @entity60 is considered to be much more toxic by entry through the skin and somewhat more toxic by inhalation , " the @entity52 said			0
mustard gas -- also known as sulfur mustard -- leaves chemical burns on the skin , eyes and even the lungs when inhaled			2
it was commonly used in @entity77 while mustard gas can be fatal , it also can disable victims and can cause cancer or permanent blindness			0
@entity6 's endgame in sight as rebels advance -- how are chemical weapons deployed ? @entity6 could deliver chemical agents through a variety of ammunition , such as bombs dropped from aircraft , @entity92 surface - to - surface missiles , artillery shells or rockets , according to @entity95 of the @entity96			1
-- how long do the dangers linger ? a person 's clothing can emit sarin for about 30 minutes after exposure to sarin vapor , which can lead to exposure of other people , the @entity52 said			2
@entity53 can also be ingested though contaminated food			0
vx gas evaporates very slowly , at about the same rate as motor oil			0
as with sarin , it can also be emitted from clothing for up to half an hour after exposure			0
sulfur mustard , however , can stay in the environment for a few days under average weather conditions and up to months under very cold conditions , according to the @entity52			0
-- how devastating can chemical attacks get ? one of the most horrific chemical attacks on a civilian area occurred 25 years ago , when @entity120 unleashed chemical weapons in @entity124 's @entity123 city of @entity125			1
the attack left thousands dead and thousands more wounded			0
-- what 's the risk of @entity6 using chemical weapons on foreigners ? while @entity6 has vowed it would never use " unconventional weapons " or weapons of mass destruction against its citizens , it gave a stern warning to other countries who might try to intervene militarily in the @entity6 conflict : " all the stocks of these weapons that the @entity6 possesses are monitored and guarded by the @entity6 army			1
these weapons are meant to be used only and strictly in the event of external aggression against the @entity6 , " @entity144 spokesman @entity143 said in july			2
but with no end in sight to @entity6 's 21 - month conflict , some are n't so sure @entity6 will keep its promise			1
" for the first time in the history of the @entity158 ( @entity158 ) , which entered into force in april 1997 , there are serious concerns that chemical weapons might be used , " said @entity153 , director - general of the @entity154			2
@entity36 president @entity162 warned @entity6 that any deployment of chemical agents would be catastrophic			2
" the use of chemical weapons is and would be totally unacceptable , " @entity162 said this week			2
" and if you make the tragic mistake of using these weapons , there will be consequences , and you will be held accountable			0
" @entity0 's @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
