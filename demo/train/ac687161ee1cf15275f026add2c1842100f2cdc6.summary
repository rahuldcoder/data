it 's the albatross which has hung around the neck of world football for the past five years -- so what next for @entity5 and the @entity6 ? the question about when the tournament will be held was revealed in @entity9 tuesday with a november / december timetable proposed			1
having been cleared of any wrongdoing by @entity13 's investigation into alleged corruption into the bidding process surrounding the 2022 tournament , @entity5 and world governing body @entity18 must now negotiate the minefield of placating a host of parties by playing a @entity6 outside of the traditional june / july schedule			1
when @entity5 won the bid in 2010 , its opponents thought they were all bidding for the same tournament -- but it turns out that 's not quite true			1
the intense heat in the @entity29 state during june / july is considered potentially too dangerous for the players to play in , meaning this @entity6 will take place in the @entity5 winter -- and hugely inconvenience the world 's biggest domestic leagues			1
" the prospect of a winter @entity6 is neither workable nor desirable for @entity40 domestic football , " an @entity36 ( @entity36 ) spokesman told @entity1 ahead of the announcement			2
so what 's happening this week ? a @entity18 task force , that 's a committee to the rest of us , has had plenty to consider in making its recommendation over the @entity6 's date			1
a tournament held at the starf of 2022 would represent huge problems for broadcasters , with the @entity53 sporting schedule already packed in january with the @entity55 playoffs , while the @entity56 are set to take place the following month			2
@entity57 , the @entity18 president , has already said that he wanted the tournament to take place in the final two months of the year , but the @entity60 , which lobbies on behalf of the continent 's biggest teams , is opposed to such a plan			1
it had wanted the competition held in april / may , arguing those dates would mean less disruption to domestic seasons			2
@entity69 , the players ' union , is keen on a winter @entity6 on health and safety grounds but still expresses reservations surrounding a number of human rights issues associated with staging the tournament in @entity5			1
but was n't the bidding process supposed to be for a summer @entity6 ? well , that 's what everyone else thought -- but it seems like the goalposts have been moved			1
@entity83 , one of the countries to lose out to @entity5 , was outspoken in its criticism of the tournament being switched to winter and even threatened legal action			2
originally , @entity5 said it would use air conditioning to cool the stadiums but concerns still remain			2
@entity92 led the @entity18 inspection team which examined each of the bidding countries for the @entity6 before delivering his report in october 2010			2
@entity92 concluded that @entity5 was a high - risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in december that year			1
and was n't @entity5 was under investigation ? not anymore -- in fact , @entity5 was cleared of any wrongdoing by @entity13 , the man who led @entity18 's investigation into allegations of corruption surrounding the 2018 and 2022 @entity108			1
the @entity29 state , and @entity110 which will host the 2018 tournament , were both found not guilty and hence allowed to keep hold of the tournaments			1
while the full report has not been published , and @entity13 has since quit his role as ethics investigator after a falling out with @entity118 , @entity18 's chief ethics judge , there appears little chance of the investigation being re-opened			0
@entity13 's report failed to uncover a ' smoking gun ' despite allegations of wrongdoing being published by @entity126 , @entity127			0
as far as @entity18 is concerned , that 's that			0
but what about the plight of the migrant workers ? according to the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) , 1,000 workers have already died in @entity5 with the figure expected to rise to 4,000 by the time the tournament kicks off			2
the so called @entity136 -- which ties employees to a specific employer -- has , according to @entity139 and the @entity133 , been open to systematic abuse and created a de facto form of slavery for the more than one million migrant workers living within its borders a report commissioned by the @entity5 government and compiled by law firm @entity148 called for the @entity150 system to be abolished , harsher penalties for employers who withhold passports from employees and a review into why so many workers were suffering cardiac arrests			2
according to the report and confirmed by the government , 964 workers from @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 died while living and working in the country in 2012 and 2013			0
the @entity5 government says there are over 1.4 million foreign workers currently plying their trade in the country			0
in a statement released in november 2014 , the @entity168 insisted the country is making progress and expects labor reforms to be implemented over the coming months			0
" a new sponsorship law , currently under review , that will replace the outdated ' @entity150 ' system will be announced by next year , " said the statement			0
" we are also working on laws to cover domestic workers			0
" as in every country in the world , change does not happen overnight			0
significant changes such as these take more time to implement that some may wish , but we intend to effect meaningful and lasting change for the benefit of all those who live and work in @entity5			0
" our plans are going through a legislative process and we expect to make announcements about new legislation by early next year			0
" what will the decision be ? prior to tuesday 's announcement , @entity195 , who is head of the @entity197 and also leads the task force , had stated his belief the @entity6 would take place in november / december			1
speaking to reporters at the @entity203 last month , @entity201 said : " the period best suited for hosting the @entity6 in @entity5 will be in november and december because for sure it needs to be played in the winter			1
" the decision by the task force is , in essence at least , a mere proposal , though it is unlikely to be overturned when the @entity18 executive committee meets on march 19 and 20			0
it is there that the committee will ratify the proposal , although in theory , it could also reject it but that 's not expected to happen			1
what happens with broadcast deals if the tournament gets moved ? @entity53 broadcaster @entity220 signed a $ 425 million deal to show the 2018 and 2022 back in 2011			0
" you go into buying a @entity6 and you believe it 's going to be in the same time frame it 's always been , " @entity224 president @entity223 said last year			1
" clearly in @entity229 there 's much more competition for ratings points			0
" @entity223 has a point			0
a winter @entity6 would be a catastrophe for @entity220 with the tournament set to clash with the @entity55 playoffs			1
except earlier this month @entity220 secured the rights for the @entity237 without a bidding war -- a tournament which is likely to be held in @entity229			0
it remains to be seen how much of a fuss other broadcasters will make if the tournament is moved to november / december			2
what will happen to club competitions ? there are still seven years to go until the @entity6 in @entity5 so domestic leagues will have time to make plans to avoid as much disruption to their season as possible , but a switch to november and december is likely to provide a major headache for top - flight leagues and clubs			1
notably for the @entity36 , which does n't have a winter break -- unlike most other @entity40 leagues			0
that potentially presents issues for its @entity259 teams as to how best to prevent their players from suffering burnout			0
likewise @entity40 governing body @entity263 , which runs the @entity264 and @entity265 , will also have to work out how its prestigious competitions , fit around a winter @entity6			1
at the moment it 's a case of " wait and see " but this one looks set to run and run .			0

the @entity6 is set to be held in november / december in @entity5
@entity272 moved away from traditional june / july dates because of intense heat in @entity29 state
@entity263 's biggest clubs oppose plan saying it will disrupt season
@entity281 set to ratify proposal
