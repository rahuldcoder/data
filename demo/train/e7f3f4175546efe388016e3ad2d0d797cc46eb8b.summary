-- @entity2 's father died from @entity4 complications when she was a child			0
her mother never even knew he had @entity6 until she and her daughter tested positive years later			0
shocked and angry , @entity2 could n't accept the news			0
she refused to take her medicine			0
depressed and shut off from the world , @entity2 imagined she would soon die			0
then , at the urging of her mother , she joined a sunday support group for young people living with @entity6			1
over time , she became engaged in youth activities and opened her heart to the others			0
today , she is a youth peer educator at @entity18 in @entity19 , where she shares her experiences with other young people living with @entity6 , encouraging them to stay in school , take their medicine and work for a better future			1
this is just one example of a brave story			0
and there are millions more : the teenage girl who was orphaned and had to raise herself and her siblings ; the young man who refused to be silenced by discrimination and disclosed his status to friends ; or the young couple -- one hiv positive and the other not -- planning their future			0
these stories speak to the pain , loss and challenges that @entity6 and @entity4 have put upon this generation , but also to the triumph of what 's possible when we come together			2
we are part of a generation that has only known a world with @entity6			1
the @entity48 says that about 34 million people are living with @entity6 worldwide -- and 5 million of them are between the ages of 15 and 24			2
that age group accounts for an estimated 39 % of new adult hiv infections globally ; and nearly 65 % of young people living with @entity6 are women			1
most of them live in @entity56			2
@entity2 is one of those young people			1
now 20 , @entity2 has been a client at the @entity58 for @entity59 , @entity61 's partner in @entity62 , @entity63 , since 2007			0
@entity64 and i have had the honor of visiting our @entity61 programs in @entity56 -- and @entity64 just returned from a visit with some of the young people that i met when they were just toddlers			1
ten years later , these young people are living healthy , happy , hopeful lives			1
we 've seen amazing progress in the past 10 years -- and though we still have a long way to go , more people are getting @entity6 treatment and fewer babies are being born with @entity6			2
we 're seeing the results of so many people 's work to " keep a child alive , " and now , the first generation of children who received @entity6 treatment are entering adolescence and young adulthood			1
but for all of our progress , we are still failing this generation			0
in the @entity91 , young gay men and young women and men of color are particularly vulnerable to @entity6			2
in terms of rates of infection , vulnerability , impact and -- most important to us -- the enormous potential to turn this epidemic around , young people are at the center of the @entity6 epidemic			1
despite this , most @entity6 treatment programs and policies are designed for children or adults , leaving young people caught in the middle of programs that fall short in meeting their special needs			1
the good news is that across the world , young people are uniting to demand a seat at the table			1
they are demanding attention from their communities , health facilities , schools , governments and leaders			0
at @entity61 , we believe in nurturing a strong , true and loud collective voice from our world 's young people			1
we recently launched , @entity127 , a new initiative that seeks to address the needs of their generation as it relates to @entity6			2
over the next few months , we will roll out @entity127 : @entity131 , a youth - led platform to connect young advocates living with @entity6 and affected by @entity6 from @entity63 , @entity134 , @entity135 and the @entity91			2
this grassroots , virtual dialogue is about fostering a safe space for young people to come together and talk openly about @entity6 , share challenges and solutions and connect directly with influential leaders			1
we are calling for action from all young people around the world living with and affected by @entity6 and @entity4 and the global community to join this movement			1
get loud ! talk , blog , tweet and text truths about @entity6			0
by talking openly , we can take the power away from silence and fear and put it in the hands of knowledge , acceptance and love			0
tap into the y - potential : young people are passionate -- let 's harness their energy and willingness to think boldly and take risks			2
ask young people what they think and what ideas they have to turn the tide of @entity6 for their generation , their community and themselves			1
know your status : get an hiv test and talk to young people about testing , prevention -- including using condoms and having good sexual health -- and treatment if they are positive			1
@entity4 is n't over yet			0
and it wo n't be without including young people in the conversation			1
we believe in a world where young people living with @entity6 and its effects can lead a life without fear			1
you believe they can thrive and follow their dreams			0
i hope you will join us in our efforts to bring awareness and money to organizations such as @entity61			0
together , we are loud , proud , and strong ! and please tune into live streaming of the @entity196 this saturday in @entity197 , @entity198			0
i 'll be performing , as well as @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 and @entity202			0
it 's organized by the @entity204			0
