editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- in 2008 , the world cast its eyes on @entity21 , the sprawling @entity23 metropolis that was set to play host to the @entity25			2
at @entity9 , we caught wind of another story that soon had our full attention			2
as @entity23 officials were taking unprecedented and often controversial measures to sanitize the notoriously foul @entity21 air , much of the rest of the country was still covered in a thick blanket of noxious smog			1
according to a @entity39 survey at the time , 16 of the world 's 20 most - polluted cities were in @entity23			0
at the top of that list is the city of @entity44 , a coal - mining and manufacturing hub in the heart of @entity48			1
within weeks , we assembled a film crew and went off to the landlocked province in northern @entity23 to find out more			0
after touching down in @entity21 and making a quick visit to the @entity53 countdown clock , we set out to visit the single most polluted place on @entity55 , hoping to place the dubious ranking into a human context			0
despite the @entity23 government 's promise of a marathon - friendly city , the @entity21 air at the time was still plenty oppressive			1
but nothing could have prepared us for the dystopian scenario we encountered during our week in @entity44 and the surrounding area			1
see the rest of @entity68 at @entity9 before the trip , i had researched thousands of images of the pollution that plagues @entity68 and @entity48 province , but to see it in person is , quite simply , devastating			1
the sun sets before it is supposed to , disappearing into a curtain of smog above the true horizon			1
residents scavenge the roadside for coal that falls from the seemingly endless cavalcade of coal trucks , gathering it with bare hands			1
schoolchildren play against the nonstop backdrop of billowing exhaust			0
many of the elderly have trouble speaking between gasps of widespread emphysema			0
residents of @entity68 are aware of the growing threat the polluted air and water pose , and some of them have left the city			1
most , however , have no choice but to stay			0
the infamy of a no. 1 ranking in the news media eventually motivated @entity23 to focus more attention on cleaning up @entity44 , but unfortunately , the scene of overwhelming pollution is still rampant in many parts of the country			1
as easy as it is to criticize @entity23 's bold industrial development , our visit was also a clear reminder of the same pattern of manufacturing and consumption that has occurred elsewhere since the dawn of the @entity118			0
in @entity23 , it just happens to be on a much grander scale and on the back of a globalized economy that has rendered @entity23 into an assembly line for the world			0
the most compelling research i came across to this end are recently published studies showing particulate matter from @entity23 's factories and mines reaching across the @entity132 to @entity134 's @entity133			0
@entity23 obviously has some cleaning up to do , and more importantly , some major strategizing to achieve a sustainable economy			0
our futures are inextricably linked			0
back in @entity8 , the coal mines of @entity48 feel worlds away , but as oil now gushes ceaselessly into our own backyard , we should pay even more attention to @entity68 if we do n't want it to be a glimpse into our own future .			1

the city of @entity44 has a *permanent* toxic smog *hovering* over the city
air quality there is the *equivalent* of *smoking* three packs of *cigarettes* a *day*
@entity68 produces and consumes large amount of coal
