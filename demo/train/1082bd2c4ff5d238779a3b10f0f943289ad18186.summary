@entity0 -- two days after @entity0 's chief executive relented to protesters ' demands to drop a controversial @entity7 education requirement , pro-democracy legislators monday got a boost from a majority turnout at the polls			1
more than 1.8 million people -- or 53 % of registered voters -- turned out at the polls sunday , and pan-democrats won more directly elected seats than the pro-beijing camp , as well as three of the five so - called super seats			1
however , @entity20 legislators still maintained their dominance at the @entity22 , thanks to infighting among the pan-democratic factions -- and a system that combines direct and indirect voting via special interest groups			0
under @entity0 's political system , 35 seats are elected directly by the public ( " geographic constituencies " ) and 35 by groups based on professions ( " functional constituencies " ) , most of which lean pro-beijing			1
in a new complex " one person - two votes " arrangement , voters can cast ballots not just within their geographic constituency but also for a list of candidates vying in a " super lawmaker " functional constituency			0
with 27 -- or more than a third -- of the 70 seats won monday , pan-democrats will still wield veto power and can block constitutional changes			1
the election comes on the heels of a 10 - day hunger strike to protest " @entity60 , " a curriculum that critics likened to " brainwashing " with @entity7 propaganda			1
on saturday , chief executive @entity61 said the decision to teach it would be left to schools			0
while the emotionally charged education issue led to higher turnout at the polls , the pro-beijing camp benefited from split votes among the pan-democrats , thanks to bitterness within the coalition over 2010 electoral reforms , one political observer said			1
read about the curriculum issue that sparked protests the radical @entity78 group had called on supporters to cast blank ballots as a form of protest against pan-democratic parties that sided with the government on the reform package , arguing that it stymied @entity0 's path to a full democracy , according to the @entity88			2
by noon monday local time , @entity89 had resigned as leader of the @entity92 after a poor showing in the elections , even though he was among the lists of candidates that won " super lawmaker " seats			2
" pro-democracy voters went for parties that did n't have that kind of bitterness between them , " said @entity99 , a professor of government at @entity101 and director of the @entity103			2
among the beneficiaries in the elections were the @entity110 and the new @entity111 , which represent the interests of labor , unionists and populists committed to social programs , he said			0
" i do n't think we 'll have progress on the pro-democracy front for a while , " @entity99 said			0
he predicted that @entity61 may find himself trying to build capital with legislators who are more welfare - oriented and with voters fed up with corruption scandals that dogged his predecessor , @entity126			0
the elections are the fifth since @entity0 , a former @entity130 colony , was handed over to @entity7 in 1997 and became a special administrative region under a " one country , two systems " model			2
