-- @entity1 and the @entity2 have become embroiled in a full - scale diplomatic row involving the case of @entity5 , an @entity1 diplomat who was arrested last week and charged with visa fraud by @entity2 authorities			1
prosecutors claim she imported and employed an @entity1 housekeeper to whom she paid only a small fraction of her promised wages			0
after @entity5 's arrest , she was strip - searched in a private setting by a female @entity2 marshal			2
this in particular caused a firestorm of criticism in @entity1 , though prosecutors and police claim all standard procedures were followed and that @entity5 was even given special considerations due to her diplomatic status			0
opinion : @entity2 actually owes @entity1 apology over strip - search while the courts will eventually resolve the welter of claims and counterclaims -- even the most basic facts in the case are currently in dispute and the diplomat 's attorney says the charges are false -- it is clear that this arrest was the result of an investigation lasting several months			1
given the sensitivity of arresting a diplomat representing a major @entity2 ally , it seems likely that prosecutors feel that the case against @entity5 is very strong			0
however , even without being able to determine @entity5 's guilt or innocence with respect to the charges , l'affaire @entity5 shines an unflattering light on several elements of @entity1 's diplomacy and its politics of privilege			1
first , whether or not the charges and manner of arrest were proper , the intemperate reaction of the @entity1 government in response shows that , despite its status as an aspiring great power , @entity1 still frequently lacks the maturity on the world stage to behave like one			0
in the wake of the arrest , @entity1 announced a number of steps against @entity2 diplomats , including revoking government - issued ids for @entity2 diplomats in @entity1 , stopping the @entity2 embassy from importing most goods , and most provocatively removing a concrete security barricade at the @entity72 in @entity75			1
the sensitivity of such a threat to the embassy can not be taken lightly , and the willingness of the @entity1 government to take such a step indicates a situation in which politics has run roughshod over any sensible understanding of diplomacy			0
even if @entity1 feels its diplomat was ill - treated , a responsible power does not inflame the situation , especially against an ally that happens to be the world 's most powerful country			2
there are many ways to show displeasure without putting the safety of @entity2 diplomats at risk			0
and there are more important moral and political issues that @entity1 has to address with the @entity2 that do not involve , if the charges are true , vindicating the inalienable right of @entity1 's diplomats to illegally import and underpay domestic servants			1
meanwhile , @entity5 and her father , a retired senior civil servant in the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) have gone on a pr offensive , with mr. @entity105 charging , " it is nothing but a racial bias			0
it is simple and clear racial bias to harass the @entity1			0
" in light of such claims , which were frequently echoed in the @entity1 media , it bears mentioning that the @entity2 attorney who brought the case , @entity117 , is himself a native of @entity1 , and he has strongly defended the action			2
in addition to the @entity1 government 's extremely provocative steps , the treatment of the case by most of the @entity1 media has also shown a substantial moral blind spot : few members of either the commentariat or the political class , neither of whom were short on outrage over @entity5 's treatment , seemed to evince much sympathy for the maid in question , who , if prosecutors are believed , has been the victim of a crime , not the perpetrator of one			1
quite to the contrary , according to @entity1 media reports , the maid 's family in @entity1 were threatened when she made her initial complaint and eventually were temporarily brought to the @entity2 to assure their safety during the prosecution			1
the deafening silence in the maid 's defense , in favor of a full - throated defense of an alleged criminal of the higher social class , tells a sad story about the reality of power and privilege in @entity1 that will be familiar to many foreigners who have spent substantial time in the country			2
@entity1 politicians play frequent lip service to the " aam admi " or common man , but the @entity1 press is daily filled with accounts of horrific mistreatment meted out by upper - class @entity1 against @entity1 's " common citizens " ( for example , just last month a member of @entity1 's parliament was arrested for beating a servant to death -- allegedly over the quality of her dusting )			1
in that context , it is worth noting that this is not the first recent case of alleged abuse of domestic servants at @entity1 's @entity184			1
in 2011 , a member of the household staff sued @entity1 's consul general in @entity184 , accusing him of forced labor			1
he denied the accusation ; the case was subsequently settled but the terms of the settlement do not appear to be public			0
less than a year later another @entity1 maid won a similar case against the consulate 's former press and culture counselor			0
in that case , according to the @entity203 , " the @entity1 diplomat has refused to pay the amount , a position supported by an @entity1 court			0
" the ultimate disposition of the @entity5 case is uncertain -- perhaps @entity2 prosecutors will have been found to have made a catastrophic blunder			0
but no matter what the result in the court of law , the case shines a disturbing light on the politics of privilege in @entity1 -- and on the ability of the @entity1 government to conduct diplomacy befitting a great power , one that seeks to ease tensions with allies over disagreements rather than needlessly inflaming them			2
opinion : @entity2 actually owes @entity1 apology over strip - search the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			1

@entity2 - @entity1 in diplomatic dispute over treatment of consular official in @entity184
@entity228 : @entity1 's government and media *overreacted* to the events
he says @entity1 's *retaliatory* measures do *n't* befit a great country , needlessly endanger @entity2 *relations*
@entity228 : few *observers* in @entity1 *focused* on the apparent *plight* of the domestic worker
