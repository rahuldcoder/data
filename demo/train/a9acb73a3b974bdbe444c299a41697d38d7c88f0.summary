-- a @entity2 official accused @entity3 of shipping workers into @entity5 , @entity6 , for president @entity8 's visit to the oil - stricken area friday and sending them away once the president left the region			1
early friday morning , " a number of buses brought in approximately 300 to 400 workers that had been recruited all week , " @entity14 councilman @entity13 told @entity0 's " @entity18			1
" @entity13 said the workers were offered $ 12 an hour to come out to the scene at @entity5 and work in what he called a " dog and pony show			0
" but , when @entity8 departed , so did the workers , he said , adding that he 's never seen more than 20 workers at the @entity5 cleanup site since the effort started			1
@entity3 chief operating officer @entity30 downplayed the claim friday evening , telling @entity0 it is not unusual to see people wrapping up work in the afternoon			2
" these individuals are working out in the heat of the sun. these are long days			0
they start early in the morning and they stop early in the evening , " he said			0
" so the fact that they were leaving the location late in the afternoon was not unusual			0
it 's not associated with the president arriving			1
" @entity30 added that the workers would be back saturday morning to continue working			0
the company hired to provide the cleanup workers told @entity46 , a @entity47 - based radio station , that it was told to beef up the cleaning work force five days ago			1
" no , i did not put extra workers on the job because the president was coming , " said @entity49 of @entity50 , which was contracted by @entity3 to help in the cleanup effort			1
an official at the oil cleanup command center told @entity0 that a temporary busing system had been established to shuttle the growing number of workers because of limited parking and housing accommodations in areas most impacted by the spilled oil			2
the official said trained responders were putting in 12 to 14 - hour days			2
@entity13 told @entity0 's @entity67 the hundreds of workers who showed up early friday would n't speak to local emergency management officials			2
" the sheriff 's office did manage to get one person to speak with them and that individual said they were hired yesterday and told to report to a staging area at 7:30 this morning , " @entity13 added			0
" it just does n't add up			0
