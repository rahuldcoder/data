@entity1 , @entity0 -- " i 'm having a vision of the near future			2
boom or bust ? experts have varying predictions on the future of cds and albums as we know them			1
" i see an artist pictured with her best friend			2
the friend is her manager and webmaster			2
the caption congratulates them for a @entity18 from @entity19 for 500,000 play events			2
" the two gals do n't mention the @entity23 , @entity24 or any label			0
they are thirteen years old			0
" these words from well - known music artists ' rights advocate , educator and industry commentator , @entity32 , illustrate the degree to which the music industry is in rapid change			1
almost symbolic of this change is the significant deal between social networking web site @entity37 and three major record labels -- @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 -- to form @entity43			1
the company is set to launch later in september , and for the record labels involved , it offers the chance to establish a greater online presence and earn advertising income as they challenge the effects of @entity52 file - sharing and the proliferation of online music promotion web sites			1
@entity43 will allow users to listen to any song from the catalogs of the music giants for free			1
they will also be able to create playlists on their own page , and purchase tracks -- all while consuming advertisements			0
such a project has been almost inevitable as record labels scramble for answers to declining album sales			1
but does @entity43 offer the solution ? while most experts believe record labels and the wider music industry have a strong future , there are mixed feelings about @entity43 as a panacea for album sales			1
do you think recording industry can have a strong future in the face of the @entity80 ? degree leader in music industries at @entity83 , @entity84 , believes the company will not have a massive impact on sales			1
" i do n't think it 's going to have an impact on album sales or how many singles are sold , " he said			1
" this is just one of these cases where big businesses are getting together ... it 's just mutually beneficial			0
it 's kind of ' business as usual ' for the companies			0
" long - time music industry figure @entity99 was more critical of the new venture			1
" radio on demand , in one 's home , in front of the computer , which is what @entity37 actually is , is not a sexy alternative to owning what you want and taking it to the beach , to the party , to your workout , " he said			0
@entity116 , however , told @entity2 he was optimistic about its chances			0
" it 's going to be an accounting nightmare and wrought with speed - bumps , but it 's a step in the right direction			0
" they know they ca n't simply survive selling cds. the future is clearly in digital			0
it gives them an important piece of leverage over @entity132 , " he said			0
working against the record labels is a plethora of other online music promoters			1
the likes of tunecore.com , @entity138 , sellaband.com and prominent social networking sites have all offered opportunities for artists to get their name and music to a global audience			0
however , will these sites be enough to topple the recording label giants ? not for a second , said @entity116			0
" these are massive entities that are not just simply going to go away			0
they are still making money			0
" he said the web sites were claiming a space in the market , but they are no match for the labels			1
" we will see pretty soon an indie artist who finally sells 500,000 albums just off the downloads			0
but , if you are talking about someone who wants a worldwide hit or to sell a million or more cds there 's still no way to do that other than through a major record label , " @entity116 said			1
@entity84 agreed about the power of the labels			1
" while you may not need a record label to get yourself out there , you still need a lot of the things that a record label has			1
it used to be that there were signed and un-signed artists			0
now there 's a big , long gray area			0
" @entity99 told @entity2 that record labels had too many valuable catalogs to disappear , but he felt they would decline if they did not find a new business model			1
what does the future hold then ? @entity116 sees some major changes , but also continuity , describing the current situation as the " beginning of a new beginning "			1
" it 's ( album sales ) probably going to continue to decline , but not at the level we have seen			2
the reason they are always going to be around is because there are so many cd players in everything			0
" he believes that file - sharing is a " fad " and predicts it will fade in popularity			1
@entity99 disagrees , saying that the industry needs to either legitimize file - sharing or create something " just as good " that is also cheap			1
@entity207 also forecasts more deals where ' sales ' can be regained as music gets bundled in with products			2
he cites cellular phone companies offering downloads as a part of pay - monthly packages			0
such a service has been announced by @entity217 in the @entity218 , where subscribers can get a year of unlimited access to the @entity222 catalogue			0
although the move has drawn comment from analysts , who believe this could rival @entity132 and form a future path for the industry , @entity99 is again skeptical , saying : " do n't give me any restrictions on when , where or what i can download ! " @entity99 instead sees the future in a new business model for selling music , which offers the sale of bundled music at cheaper prices			1
he predicts it wo n't be the companies that create the change			2
" somebody under the age of 30 is going to create a trusted model and everybody will go with them			2
it 's not going to be a corporation , it will be an entrepreneur , " he said			0
@entity84 , meanwhile , is not convinced that the music industry will find a new model			1
" there 's a lot of people trying to find the ' new model '			2
my thought is that there is n't one			0
we are not in a period of change that 's going to settle into one new thing			2
" as fresh developments are realized , and the nature of music " sales " transforms , @entity207 suggests the way in which we define " successful " records will need to change			1
he questions whether it would be fair to celebrate artists only for their album sales when other musicians may not gain the same recognition for having 500,000 downloads from a web site			2
and @entity116 's answer : surely not .			0

@entity43 will allow users to listen to songs from record labels for free
major labels hope new deal will stem flow of declining record sales
experts agree industry needs a new model to overcome @entity52 file sharing
the way in which ' successful ' records are defined may change
