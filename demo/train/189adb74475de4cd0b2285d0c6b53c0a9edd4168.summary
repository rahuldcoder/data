@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is the founder and head of @entity5 -- @entity6 which is based in @entity1 's capital , @entity0			1
" for the rest of the world @entity1 is powerful , but for many residing in the countryside , @entity1 is still disempowered , hungry and naked			1
" @entity10 started out as an organization to combat the pollution of the city 's main waterway , the river @entity15			1
today it deals with the environmental issues that affect several aspects of @entity0			0
@entity20 leads volunteers and local children to key sites around the city to tackle the ecological problems , as well as to raise awareness of the issues			1
follow his efforts in his blogs and video diaries			0
october 18 , 2007 we traveled , along with 100 - odd kids from one of @entity0 's most progressive schools , the @entity36 , to the rural part of our country , to @entity39 in @entity40			1
the purpose of the visit was to expose these young minds ( ages 15 - 17 ) to the existence of another @entity1			1
most of us have an illusion of @entity1 becoming a powerful nation and it is on a phenomenal growth trajectory			1
we are not so much seen as a developing nation but a developed nation			0
one wonders what actually makes a country developed , when most of the parameters of development are skewed , as is the case of our country			0
for the rest of the world @entity1 is powerful , but for many residing in the countryside , @entity1 is still disempowered , hungry and naked			2
up to 70 percent of @entity1 still live in villages			2
most of the time these villages are neglected and are centers of poverty			0
development around @entity1 's cities has brought a flood of people from the rural areas who come in search of jobs			1
this population comprises the " urban poor " which is more vulnerable than the rural poor			0
imagine , @entity1 still has more than 260 million people ( 26 percent of the population ) living below the poverty line			2
in the last 10 years , we have had at least 40,000 farmer suicides in the country -- indicative of the growing gap between the poor and the rich			0
the purpose of this trip was to learn , and unlearn , about village stereotypes or notions we live with			2
the village in @entity40 was n't as extreme an experience as other remote villages of @entity1 , but it was indicative of the hardships that people live with			1
another reason for the trip was to celebrate the simplicity and generosity of the villagers vis - Ã  - vis we , the insecure urbanites , and also to understand their hardships , due to our over-consumption and false assumption that our wrongdoing does not necessarily influence the rural population -- when we know it does			2
for many students , it was a first - time , first - hand experience of a village			0
some were overwhelmed with the beauty and many were saddened by the villagers ' plight			1
the outing also gave them an opportunity to contribute in some way			0
students worked in the fields , helped the villagers in agricultural work and breathed the clean air			0
it was a wonderful experience , aimed at understanding the gap between the two exisiting worlds ; to bridge the gap between these two worlds			0

@entity20 takes a group of children to see a village in @entity40
his aim was to show them the *differences* between @entity1 's city and village life
many of the children had never been to an @entity1 village
@entity145 says they were " saddened by the villagers ' plight "
