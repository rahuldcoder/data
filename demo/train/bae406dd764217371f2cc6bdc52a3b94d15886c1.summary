@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 continues to support the @entity4 in @entity1 , a secret @entity6 report says , according to a journalist who has read it , despite years of @entity3 denials and @entity11 pressure to stop backing the insurgency			1
@entity3 's @entity15 knows the whereabouts of all senior @entity4 commanders , @entity14 reporter @entity13 said wednesday , citing the report			1
@entity3 dismissed the accusation that it is helping the @entity4 across the border			1
" we are committed to non-interference in @entity1 , " @entity22 spokesman @entity21 said wednesday			1
" this is frivolous , to put it mildly			0
" he added , " @entity3 has suffered enormously because of the long conflict in @entity1			2
a stable and peaceful @entity1 is in our own interest and we are very much cognizant of this			0
" @entity6 downplayed the importance of the document			1
the classified report is based on the " opinions or ideals " of @entity4 detainees , and represented only their opinions , not the actual progress of @entity6 against the @entity4 , @entity34 spokesman lt. col. @entity33 said			1
the document says the @entity4 depend on @entity3 for support , even though they do not necessarily welcome it , @entity13 said			1
" it is a marriage of convenience , " he said			0
the @entity4 see @entity3 as manipulative , but they see no alternative to accepting its support , he said			1
the @entity4 are absolutely confident of victory , he said the report found , based on 27,000 interviews with more than 4,000 detainees ranging from senior @entity4 commanders to @entity1 civilians			1
they also include mid- and low - level @entity4 , @entity54 , and foreign fighters , he said			2
@entity2 has not seen the document , but has been told by @entity34 that reports of its contents are for the most part accurate			0
@entity34 spokesman @entity33 said wednesday not to read too much into it			0
he said it was " extremely important not to draw conclusions based on @entity4 comments or musings " and that the report " should not be used as any interpretation of campaign progress " against the insurgency			1
a military official in @entity0 said such reports have been done for " several years " and it was not written by military personnel			0
and a @entity6 official noted that the " @entity4 - led insurgency in @entity1 has suffered dramatic losses of leadership and resources , " insisting that " @entity4 momentum has been significantly reversed			1
" @entity82 spokesman capt. @entity81 said the report , called " @entity84 of the @entity4 2012 , " is the product of thousands of interviews with @entity4 detainees in 2011			1
" it 's not just a rough transcript , but there 's been no analysis applied to it , " he said			0
the report was compiled over the course of a year , " and a lot of things changed during the year			0
2011 was a tough year for the @entity4 , " @entity81 said			2
top @entity11 officials have repeatedly suggested the @entity1 insurgency gets support from @entity3			2
adm. @entity99 testified in september that the @entity4 and the @entity100 , another militant group , had safe havens in @entity3 that they used to launch cross-border attacks on @entity11 troops in @entity1			1
" because of providing that safe haven , because of connections between @entity3 intelligence and the @entity100 , @entity3 bears some responsibility for the attacks on us , " said @entity99 , who was then chairman of the @entity105			1
he told the @entity112 that it was an important @entity11 aim to have " a positive relationship with @entity3 , " but said : " in order for there to be a normal relationship between our two countries it is imperative that @entity3 actively break its ties with the militant extremists using their soil against us			2
" a month later , @entity11 secretary of state @entity125 threw down a gauntlet to @entity3 as she prepared to travel there from @entity1			2
" our message is very clear : we 're going to be fighting , we 're going to be talking , we 're going to be building , " she said			0
" and they can either be helping or hindering			0
but we are not going to stop our efforts to create a strong foundation for an @entity1 free from interference , violent conflict and one that has a chance to chart its own future			0
" relations between the @entity11 and @entity3 -- complicated at the best of times -- have been especially tense in the past year			2
@entity138 was angered when @entity11 special operations forces killed @entity54 leader @entity140 in a cross-border raid into @entity3 , and furious at the killing of 24 @entity3 troops in a november @entity6 strike which the coalition called a case of mistaken identity			1
wednesday 's leaked report is consistent with the latest @entity11 intelligence analysis of the @entity4			1
the @entity11 intelligence community said tuesday that @entity1 's insurgents remain " resilient " and senior @entity4 leaders " enjoy safe haven in @entity3			1
" the annual threat assessment compiled by all the various @entity11 intelligence agencies said @entity4 - led insurgents have " lost ground in some areas , " but mainly where @entity6 - led " surge forces are concentrated			1
" a @entity11 official told @entity2 the @entity34 report includes a summary of comments from " some of the most motivated and ruthless insurgents that are trying to boost insurgent morale			2
" " some of the stuff there you could n't even deem ' intel			0
' it 's just comments , " said the official , referring to intelligence			0
@entity13 , the @entity14 journalist , said the report said it should be treated as informational and not necessarily analytical			0
the official described the report as " relatively new " and " an internal document for our use that 's not meant to be distributed			1
" the official , who is not authorized to discuss contents of the report on the record with the media and asked not to be named , emphasized that it did not represent the opinions of @entity34			2
the official declined to say whether the report was seen by top @entity6 commanders , including the @entity34 commander , gen. @entity191			1
the leak comes as @entity1 president @entity194 's government appears to be moving slowly toward talks with the @entity4			0
@entity194 's government recently dropped its opposition to the @entity4 establishing an office in the @entity200 state of @entity201 to facilitate talks			0
and it may be opening a separate channel to talk to the insurgency			0
the @entity1 government hopes to hold talks with @entity4 representatives in @entity210 in the coming weeks , a senior @entity1 official said tuesday , in a move that threatens to cloud already fragile steps to negotiate an end to the @entity11 ' longest war			2
the senior official , speaking anonymously as he was discussing sensitive diplomatic issues , said there were plans for a meeting between insurgents and @entity1 officials in @entity210			0
yet , he added , the plans were at such an early stage that it was not clear who -- including @entity11 officials -- would attend or when any talks would be held			0
the @entity11 has acknowledged that it has held discussions about the opening of a @entity4 office in @entity231 , @entity201 , as well as the possibility of transferring some @entity4 prisoners held at @entity234 as part of @entity11 support for @entity1 reconciliation efforts			0
@entity2 's @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 contributed to this report .			0
