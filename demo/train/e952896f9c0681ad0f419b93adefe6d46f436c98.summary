editor 's note : @entity2 is former @entity3 secretary of state			1
@entity4 is former @entity3 secretary of defense			1
they are co-chairs of the @entity6			1
@entity2 served as secretary of state under president @entity8			1
( @entity9 ) -- in this age of electronic media communications , @entity3 are increasingly confronted in their living rooms -- and even on their cell phones -- with information about and images of genocide and mass atrocities virtually anywhere they occur			2
this instantaneous media communication has sensitized many @entity3 to the suffering of people in all corners of the globe			0
the @entity23 has proved to be a powerful tool for organizing broad - based responses to genocide and mass atrocities , as we have seen in response to the crisis in @entity30			2
with all of this information written and broadcast about the horrors of genocide and mass atrocities around the world , why do they continue ? and as public citizens , public officials and policymakers , how can we prevent this horrendous crime that assaults our humanitarian values and threatens our national security ? last year , we agreed to co-chair the @entity6 , which was jointly convened by the @entity43 , @entity44 and the @entity45			1
( the final report is to be released next week			1
) the idea for the task force arose out of a desire by each of these institutions to reach beyond their individual capabilities and build a practical framework that could help the @entity3 government better respond to threats of genocide and mass atrocities			2
our challenge was to match words to deeds and stop allowing the unacceptable			0
that task is in fact one of the most persistent puzzles of our times			0
many people ask : why do genocides and mass atrocities happen ? there is no consensus as to the causes of genocide and mass atrocities , nor is there one commonly agreed - upon theory that explains the key catalysts , motivations or mechanisms that lead to them			1
history has shown that genocide and mass atrocities manifest themselves in highly variable ways , and we should not assume that future perpetrators will follow old patterns			2
however , there are warning signs			2
genocide is not the inevitable result of " ancient hatreds " or irrational leaders			0
it requires planning and is carried out systematically			0
but that fact also means that there are ways to recognize its signs and symptoms , and viable options to prevent it at every turn , if we are committed and prepared			0
our report recommends a number of distinct but interrelated areas where the @entity3 government can develop and deploy more effective strategies to identify and pursue opportunities for prevention of genocide and mass atrocities : first , we believe that leadership is an indispensable ingredient			1
nothing is more central to preventing genocide than leadership -- from the president , @entity115 and the @entity3 people			1
making progress requires leaders to summon political will not only after a crisis strikes , but also before one emerges			0
@entity121 is the importance of early warning			1
it is critical for policymakers to have good analysis of areas where there is a high risk of genocide or organized violence in order to design effective strategies and spur action			1
by improving the accuracy of warnings , we will find greater opportunities for preventive action			2
early prevention can avert a crisis			0
many countries are vulnerable to extreme violence			0
by engaging leaders , institutions and civil society at an early stage , the @entity3 can help countries steer clear of these dangers			0
preventive diplomacy is critical to halt and reverse escalation			1
even when signs of preparation for genocide are apparent , there are opportunities to alter leaders ' decisions and interrupt their plans			0
by improving our crisis response system , we will be better prepared to mount coherent , carefully calibrated and timely preventive diplomatic strategies			0
a willingness to utilize military options to stop ongoing atrocities when prevention efforts have failed is crucial			0
@entity3 military assets can also play an important role in supporting and providing credibility to options short of the use of force , including by deterring violence through military presence or threat			0
lastly , we cite the power of international action			1
the @entity3 has an interest in promoting a system of international norms and institutions that averts potential genocide and mass atrocities before they occur , stops them quickly and effectively when they occur , helps societies rebuild in their wake and holds perpetrators accountable			2
by working in partnership with others in the global community , the @entity3 will multiply its positive impact			0
we do not underestimate the challenge			0
we understand that the next president will face many pressing international priorities , as well as real limitations of time and resources			0
but we believe that preventing genocide is possible , and that striving to do so is imperative , both for our national interests and for our leadership position in the world			1
our report seeks to honor the memory of past victims of genocide and mass atrocities by encouraging future action			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity4			1
other members of the @entity6 include @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 ( 1942 - 2008 )			2
