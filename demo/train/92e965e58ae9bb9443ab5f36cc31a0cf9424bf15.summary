-- a @entity2 appeals court wednesday struck down a state law barring gay men and lesbians from adoption on the basis of equal protection under law			1
the @entity2 3rd @entity10 upheld a trial court ruling that @entity2 's explicit ban was unconstitutional , noting that the state 's adoption law required officials to assess potential adoptive parents in " the best interests of the child			1
" " by the time of the trial below , the application of the statutory ban was contrary to both the professional judgment of the @entity26 and the legislative directive to assure ' the best interest of the child ' in ' every ' adoption , " wrote judge @entity19 in the 42 - page ruling			1
shortly after the unanimous ruling was announced , gov. @entity31 -- who is running for a @entity33 seat as an independent -- said the state would " stop enforcing the ban			1
" a supporter of the ban earlier in his career , when he was a @entity40 , @entity31 added that he was very pleased with the ruling			2
@entity42 , the spokesman for the @entity26 , said the department has 30 days to decide on an appeal , " but we will make a decision sooner than that			1
" " we are analyzing the court 's opinion and wish to give any decision to appeal a thorough review , " he said , adding that their decision would consider " the impact on the family directly involved in this case			1
" " as of now , this decision does stand as the law in @entity2 , and we are currently not enforcing the ban , " he said			2
" the primary consideration on whether to appeal is finding the balance between the value of a final ruling from the @entity2 @entity62 versus the impact on the @entity65 family			1
" the @entity2 @entity62 several years ago considered a challenge to the law based on equal protection but sent the case back to the district court to collect more information			0
the case was later abandoned			0
the current case involved a gay man who was a licensed foster parent , allowed under @entity2 law , who wanted to adopt two boys who had been placed in his care after the @entity26 and @entity77 removed them from their home for neglect			0
the @entity80 , a private , nonprofit company that provides adoption services through a contract with the state , reported that " the home presented a suitable environment " and that the gay man -- identified as " @entity88 " in court documents and as @entity90 by the @entity91 , which represented him -- " met all the criteria required to adopt the two boys			2
" but the center recommended against the adoption because of the @entity2 law , and the department denied the application			2
" @entity97 acknowledged that it would have approved the application if it had not been for the statute , " @entity19 wrote			0
@entity65 sued , and the trial court agreed that the ban was unconstitutional			2
the department appealed the ruling to the district court			0
in the ruling , @entity19 wrote that gay men and lesbians are the only people barred from adopting in the state law and that the ban could stand up only if " there is a rational basis for the difference in treatment			1
" instead , she wrote , the argument against was not that gay men and lesbians were unfit parents			0
" instead , the @entity26 argues that there is a rational basis for the prohibition on homosexual adoption because children will have better role models , and face less discrimination , if they are placed in non-homosexual households , preferably with a husband and wife as the parents , " she wrote			1
" but that is not what the statute does			0
" the law does not prohibit single people from adopting -- and does not bar gay men and lesbians from fostering children or guardianship , she noted			0
" it is difficult to see any rational basis in utilizing homosexual persons as foster parents or guardians on a temporary or permanent basis , while imposing a blanket prohibition on adoption by those same persons , " she wrote			1
@entity65 was delighted with the ruling			0
" this is just the news that we have been waiting so anxiously for here , " he said in an @entity91 statement			0
" this is a giant step toward being able to give our sons the stability and permanency that they are being denied			0
