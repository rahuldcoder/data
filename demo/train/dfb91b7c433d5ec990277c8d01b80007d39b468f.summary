-- a cloud - computing company is building what it calls " the world 's first zero - emission data center " in @entity5			1
the @entity7 company @entity6 says the data center will be powered fully by geothermal and hydroelectric sources of energy , which @entity5 has in spades			1
the blog @entity13 , where we spotted this story , says @entity5 could become a " magnet " for data centers because of the wide availability of renewable energy sources there			2
" why is a country , which blipped on the global news radar in recent months because of its ash - spewing volcano and hard - hit financial markets , such a hot place to construct data centers that could house thousands of servers and run web services for @entity34 giants ? " asks @entity22 from that @entity24 network blog			2
" first off : location			0
its placement between @entity38 and the @entity39 means that companies in the @entity39 can run their web services for both continents in one location , potentially saving money , " says @entity22			0
" secondly , because of its abundant hydropower and geothermal power , @entity5 can offer data center services powered by 100 % clean power for the same price or less than web services powered by fossil fuel - based grids in other locations			1
internet companies can use the clean power to market their green services , or take advantage of green subsidies in certain markets			0
" @entity60 , an executive at @entity6 , says his company chose @entity5 because of renewable energy : " the location of this data center has been strategically placed so that it will be the first in the world to use 100 % dual sourced renewable energy sources , " he writes in a company blog post			1
this development is significant because data centers -- giant warehouses of computers that store information that 's on the @entity34 -- use lots of electricity			1
in the @entity39 , these info factories account for about 1.5 % of all energy use , according to a 2007 report from the @entity39 @entity78			1
total data center energy use was expected to double by this year			0
worldwide , data center energy use increased 56 % from 2005 to 2010 , according to a report from @entity82 's @entity81 , which was commissioned by @entity83			2
that 's less than was expected , but is still significant , the report says			0
@entity6 expects its @entity5 data center to be up and running within four months			1
other data centers have claimed to purchase their energy from 100 % renewable sources in the past , and there 's some debate about what role renewable energy should play in the greening of data centers			2
more important than purchasing green power is using less of it , writes @entity98 at the blog @entity100			0
to this point , the @entity78 recently created a program to help data centers go green			2
the construction of the " zero - emission " data center in @entity5 highlights another trend in information processing : data centers are often located in bizarre places			1
when @entity111 was all over the news earlier this year , it was revealed that the secrets - leaking website stored at least some of its files in a @entity118 style data center inside a mountain in @entity120			0
in the @entity39 , these data center are often placed near rivers , so they can use the water to cool down the computer servers , or in rural areas , where they do n't attract too much attention			0
i took a trip to a data center a couple of years ago , and you can check out that story here .			0

@entity135 says it 's opening a " zero - emission " data center in @entity5
center should be open within four months , company says
data centers store information that 's " in the cloud " of the internet
@entity78 : @entity39 data centers account for 1.5 % of nation 's electricity use
