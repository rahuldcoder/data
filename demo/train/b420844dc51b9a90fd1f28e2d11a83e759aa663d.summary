-- look out for @entity1			0
it is heading toward @entity3 at 17,450 miles per hour , according to @entity4 , and the tug of our planet 's gravitational field will cause it to accelerate when it gets here			1
but it 's not going to strike us , when it passes by on february 15			0
@entity4 is adamant about this			2
" its orbit is very well - known , " said dr. @entity13 , @entity4 specialist for near - @entity3 objects			2
" we know exactly where it 's going to go , and it can not hit the @entity3			0
" but it will give the @entity20 the closest shave by any object its size in known history , @entity13 said			1
gravity will cause it to fly a curved path , tugging it closer to @entity3 's surface than most gps or television satellites			0
while the asteroid is moving at a good clip , space rockets have to accelerate to an even higher speed to escape @entity3 's gravity and make it into space			1
though 2012 @entity40 will be flying more slowly , its trajectory will keep it from falling to @entity3			1
getting a look at 2012 @entity40 star gazers in @entity43 , @entity44 or @entity45 might be able to see it with binoculars or consumer telescopes			1
it will not be visible to the naked eye , because it 's small , " about half the size of a football field , " @entity13 said			0
there are millions of asteroids in our solar system , and they come in all dimensions -- from the size of a beach ball to a large mountain , @entity4 said			1
researchers are looking forward to getting such a close look at an asteroid , as it flies from south to north past @entity3 , coming as close as 17,200 miles to our planet 's surface			2
@entity4 will ping it with a signal from a satellite dish for a few days to get a better idea of its makeup			2
astronomers think there are about half a million asteroids the size this one near @entity3 , @entity4 said , but less than one percent have been detected			1
twenty years ago , no one would likely have discovered 2012 @entity40 , @entity13 said			1
scientists spotted it nearly a year ago from an observatory in the south of @entity81			0
today , specialists track asteroids ' paths 100 years into future			0
they do so less to assess any possible threat of impact with @entity3 and more to explore what opportunities they offer			0
" these objects are important for science			0
they 're important for our future resources , " @entity13 said			0
opinion : do n't count ' doomsday asteroid ' out yet asteroids are potential gold mines asteroids can be chock full of metals and other materials , which could be mined for use on earth or on space stations			1
@entity4 has discussed the possibility of capturing near - @entity3 asteroids and placing them into @entity3 's orbit to study them and extract their resources			1
at least two start - up companies , @entity114 and @entity115 , plan to mine asteroids and sell the acquired bounty on @entity3 and in space			2
being able to exploit asteroids ' resources would allow humans to fly farther out into the solar system , build stations a long way from @entity3 and supply them with materials gathered out in space			2
some asteroids , for example , are made of ice , @entity4 said , which could be used as drinking water for a distant space platform			1
what if one like this did hit us ? an asteroid this size passes this close to @entity3 only every 40 years and collides with it only once every 1,200 years			0
if @entity4 turns out to be wrong about this one not hitting the planet -- and they wo n't be -- then asteroid 2012 @entity40 would not destroy the world in any case , @entity13 said			1
an asteroid made of metal that was about the same size collided with @entity3 50,000 years ago , creating the mile wide " @entity145 " in @entity146 and obliterating everything for 50 miles around , he said			0
2012 @entity40 is likely made of stone , which would do much less damage			1
in 1908 a similar type asteroid entered the atmosphere and exploded over @entity151 , @entity152 , leveling trees over an area of 820 square miles -- about two thirds the size of @entity158			0
not @entity3 shattering , but you still would n't want to live nearby			0

it 's going to be the closest shave in known history , @entity4 expert says
asteroid 2012 @entity40 is traveling at 17,400 *mph*
star gazers will likely turn out for a peek in @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45
asteroids may be mined in space for their *natural* resources some day
