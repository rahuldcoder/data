-- like many people in the media and political world , i first heard from @entity5 the news that @entity7 had chosen @entity8 as his running mate			1
the information appeared between 11 p.m. and midnight on a friday night			0
the alert was quickly confirmed by multiple news sources on my @entity5 feed : tv networks , newspapers , wire services			1
like many journalists , i stayed up late that night to write about the decision , filing copy over the next three hours			2
i was so weary the next morning that i very nearly slept through the broadcast of the actual announcement event in @entity22 , @entity23			0
i did n't , quite			2
and so it was a little less than 12 hours after the breaking of this important political story that i first switched on my tv			1
things move fast in the modern world , so let 's cut straight to the point : @entity32 is no longer the place where news breaks , and has not been so for years			1
social media have done to cable tv news what cable news , in its day , did to the afternoon editions of big - city papers : shouldered aside its slower and less adaptable predecessor			1
in this new world , the distinction between reporters and sources , between media and everybody else , begins to fade away			2
the correspondent who calls an expert for analysis may find himself on hold while the expert posts her thoughts to her blog for all the world to read			2
for more than a century , journalists have mediated between knowledge - holders and information consumers			2
but the @entity57 is bringing producers and consumers ever more directly into contact , whether the product is steel girders , home mortgages , or breaking news			1
what cable news does do , unrivaled , is broadcast images of events to a large global audience			1
when there 's a crowd protesting in @entity71 -- or a wildfire raging in southern @entity73 -- viewers still turn to cable			2
yet how often do such events occur ? and how much longer will even that advantage hold ? in a world of camera phones , everybody becomes a video journalist			2
our images of the violence in @entity85 all come from locals -- and are available to any media organization that will buy or barter for them			0
so what should cable do in such a news environment ? three things : 1 ) accept that the days of " the news is the star " are over			1
generic news moves too fast for cable			1
nobody will tune to a cable news network unless there is a very compelling reason to tune to that specific network at that particular time			1
there 's only one such reason : " people like to watch the people they like to watch			0
" everything else is just filler			0
like it or not , @entity111 is for personality , not only for information			0
cable news is inescapably a niche market			1
there are 311 million people in the @entity120			0
even at peak hours , 306 million of them are not watching cable news			1
at nonpeak hours , 309 million of them are not watching cable news			1
the 2 million - to 5 million - person cable news audience is made up of unusually smart and curious people , and they should be served appropriate content			1
the people who can be reached by " dumbing down " tv have already been successfully reached by the @entity132 family			0
3 ) go deep and long			1
" ' @entity133 , time , ' said old @entity134 , ' is something i ai n't got anything but			0
' " that funny little poem by @entity139 also aptly describes cable news			1
it 's got acres and acres of time to fill , 52 minutes an hour , 24 hours a day , seven days a week			0
as it is , cable news treats that time as a problem to be overcome with sound and visual effects intended to create a feeling ( almost always false ) of immediacy and urgency			1
those effects long ago lost their credibility			1
meanwhile , every day on @entity154 some amateur documentarian shows that video can be used to convey ideas and information in interesting and entertaining ways			0
see the @entity160 lectures , and the @entity162 series , and the contrasting videos produced by @entity8 for the @entity165 budget committee and @entity166 for the @entity167 @entity165			2
the website @entity168 uses video to correct deceptive reports from the @entity172			0
the @entity174 - winning documentary " @entity175 " effectively used video to unpack the 2008 financial crisis for a general audience			0
@entity32 relishes the confrontation interview			0
but the public figures that @entity111 wants to interview usually have the poise and practice to sidestep such confrontations			0
longer and less confrontational interviews -- such as those @entity186 used to do for @entity187 -- reveal much more than cable tv 's mostly misfired attempts at gotcha moments			1
in their business - book classic " @entity198 , " authors @entity191 and @entity193 quote a lament for the @entity197 company			0
" some genius invented the oreo cookie			0
we 're just living off the inheritance			0
" as tough as it is to found a great industry or great company , it is -- in its own way -- even tougher to adapt that industry or company to a new era			0
it has to be done			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			2

@entity216 says he heard about @entity8 pick on @entity5 , did n't switch on tv for many hours
he says cable no longer has corner on breaking news ; social media *scooping* it more and more
he says cable news must face new reality , get more personality - driven , seek upmarket niche
@entity229 : cable should skip fancy effects , go deep and long in reports , find new *relevance*
