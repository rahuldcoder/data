-- in a landmark ruling , an international tribunal found former @entity4 president @entity3 guilty thursday of aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring @entity7 's notoriously brutal civil war			1
it was the first war crimes conviction of a former head of state by an international court since the @entity11 of @entity13 leaders after @entity14 prosecutors , however , failed to prove that @entity3 had direct command over the rebels who committed the atrocities , said justice @entity19 of the @entity20			1
a three - judge panel issued a unanimous decision that @entity3 , 64 , was guilty on all 11 counts of the indictment against him			1
the judges found him guilty of aiding and abetting rebel forces in a campaign of terror that involved murder , rape , sexual slavery , conscripting children younger than 15 and mining diamonds to pay for guns			2
prosecutor @entity37 hailed the verdict as a milestone in accountability and said it " made clear the central role @entity3 played in the horrific crimes against the people of @entity7			1
" this judgment affirms that with leadership comes not just power and authority , but also responsibility and accountability , " she said			2
" no person , no matter how powerful , is above the law			2
" @entity3 will learn what penalty he 'll be forced to pay on may 30 , two weeks after a hearing to argue the most appropriate terms of his sentence			1
there is no death penalty in international criminal law , and @entity3 would serve out any sentence in a @entity61 prison			1
@entity3 's lawyer , @entity62 , suggested the trial was politically motivated			1
he claimed his client 's conviction was " obtained on tainted and corrupted evidence " based on the testimony of witnesses from @entity7 who were paid to appear in court			1
@entity62 portrayed @entity3 as a legitimate leader who aided rebels in a neighboring nation			1
those rebels , not @entity3 himself , should be held accountable for their actions , the lawyer contended			1
" if such behavior is to be deemed illegal , then i 'd like to see it be deemed illegal across the board , " @entity62 said , referring to leaders of the @entity80 or @entity61 potentially paying the price for crimes committed by covert groups they have supported			1
" but let 's be frank , ladies and gentlemen , " @entity62 said , " do you honestly see that ever happening ? " throughout @entity19 's reading of a long list of chilling crimes , @entity3 remained stoic			1
dressed in a charcoal gray suit , a white shirt and a burgundy tie , the former warlord stood quietly as the judge delivered the guilty verdict			2
the mood was decidedly different in @entity103 , the @entity7 capital , where , as one resident described it , every television set was on			0
relief , " said @entity107 , national director of the charity @entity108			0
" @entity111 said @entity3 's conviction was a big psychological victory for his victims			1
" people can be very cynical about justice , " she said			0
" but now you have someone finally getting caught , finally getting justice			0
" @entity121 human rights chief @entity120 noted that @entity3 can appeal the verdict , and it could be overturned			1
that said , she called his conviction " immensely significant , " saying it sends out a message that even the most powerful are not above the law			0
" this is undoubtedly a historic moment in the development of international justice , " she said			2
" a former president , who once wielded immense influence in a neighboring country where tens of thousands of people were killed , mutilated , raped , robbed and repeatedly displaced for years on end , has been arrested , tried in a fair and thorough international procedure			2
" @entity3 has been a pivotal figure in @entity4 politics for decades after he overthrew the regime of @entity140 in 1989 , plunging the country into a bloody civil war that left 200,000 dead over the next 14 years			1
after he was forced out of office under international pressure in 2003 , he lived in exile in @entity146 , where border guards arrested him in 2006 as he was attempting to cross into @entity148 amid international pressure			2
that culminated in his trial , which began in 2007 at the special court for @entity7 in @entity153 , @entity154			0
@entity121 officials and the @entity7 government jointly set up the tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities			2
the court was moved from @entity7 , where emotions about the civil war still run high			0
judges ultimately heard testimony from more than 100 people in the case			0
they included supermodel @entity167 , who told the special tribunal that she received " dirty - looking stones " she assumed were gifts from @entity3 after a dinner hosted by then - @entity173 president @entity172 in 1997			1
the prosecution was trying , with her testimony , to tie @entity3 to " blood diamonds " -- the mining and selling of diamonds , in this case to fund rebels in several @entity173 conflict areas			2
" when i was sleeping , i had a knock on my door			0
i opened the door and two men were there			0
they gave me a pouch and said , ' a gift for you , ' " she said			0
" the men did n't introduce themselves or say anything else			2
" prosecutors accused @entity3 of financing and giving orders to @entity197 rebels in @entity7 's civil war that ultimately left 50,000 dead or missing			1
his support for the rebels fueled the bloody war , prosecutors said			0
fighters included teenagers forced to kill , rape and plunder placed under the influence of drugs to provoke violent behavior			0
witnesses testified about grisly violence by the rebels during the conflict , including shooting and disemboweling pregnant women and children			0
sometimes , rebels asked people if they wanted long sleeves or short sleeves			0
the former meant hacking off hands ; the latter , forearms			0
" brave men , women and children have taken the stand against @entity3 , " the prosecutor 's office said in a written statement			1
" they have included amputees , rape victims , former child soldiers and persons enslaved , robbed , and terrorized			0
we are awed by their courage			0
" @entity237 , a former rebel child soldier in @entity7 who has written a book chronicling his experiences , said the verdict gives people in his native country good reason to celebrate friday , on its independence day			2
" i feel very happy today that such a man is no longer powerful and that the law has prevailed , " @entity237 told @entity0			0
" it shows that nobody can get away with doing such things , particularly with recruiting children in war			0
" @entity3 becomes the first former head of state since adm. @entity253 , who became president of @entity255 briefly after @entity257 's suicide , to be convicted for war crimes or crimes against humanity by an international tribunal			1
former @entity263 president @entity262 was tried by an international tribunal but died before a judgment was issued			1
the @entity266 has charged @entity267 , the former @entity268 president , with crimes against humanity			0
it also has a warrant out for @entity273 president @entity272 , who , so far , has been able to elude arrest			0
" powerful leaders like @entity3 have for too long lived comfortably above the law , " said @entity275 , senior international justice counsel at @entity276			1
" @entity3 's conviction sends a message to those in power that they can be held to account for grave crimes			1
" the @entity285 cheered thursday 's verdict , releasing a statement pointing to " progress " that has been made in @entity7 and @entity4 and saying it hoped the ruling " will help dissuade others who might follow in his footsteps			2
" @entity293 , @entity61 's foreign minister , was even more pointed in his comments			1
on @entity295 , he urged @entity297 president @entity296 -- who many have claimed has ordered troops to clamp down on civilian dissenters , killing thousands -- to pay attention to what happened at the @entity153 , lest he also someday faces charges			1
" justice has been done			0
remember his victims , & remind @entity306 : there is no expiry date for crimes against the innocent , " @entity293 said .			0

new : @entity61 foreign minister says verdict should be lesson to @entity297 's @entity296
@entity3 is the first *ex-head* of state convicted by an international tribunal since 1946
he will be sentenced may 30 and serve out his sentence in a @entity61 jail
@entity3 's lawyer says his client should n't be responsible for others ' actions
