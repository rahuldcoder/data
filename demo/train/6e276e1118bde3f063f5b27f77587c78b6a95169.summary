attorneys for a former @entity2 football player charged with rape are asking a judge to toss the case , saying several pieces of evidence have allegedly gone missing			1
and the attorneys reveal in court papers filed this week that then - head coach @entity10 had a conversation with the woman who later became the accuser in which he asked her to arrange for " fifteen pretty girls " to help with recruiting			0
the attorneys for @entity21 -- one of four former @entity2 football players charged with raping a woman last summer -- say that the accuser told this to police during an interview that has not been handed over during the pre-trial process			1
in it that interview , the attorneys say , the woman told police that @entity10 also contacted her after the rape to check on her well - being since she had helped them with recruiting			2
it 's not clear how they know what was said in during this missing interview			2
police or prosecutors have not confirmed the interview			0
" coach @entity10 called her in for a private meeting and told her he wanted her to get fifteen pretty girls together and form a team to assist with the recruiting even though he knew it was against the rules			0
he added that other colleges did it , " the motion seeking dismissal says			1
the " rules " are presumably those of the @entity50			0
in 2004 , after several allegations of rape at get - togethers designed to woo prospective players , the @entity50 passed a rule that said that students who host recruits during campus visits " must be either current student - athletes or students consistent with the school 's policy for providing campus visits or tours to prospective students generally , " @entity50 spokeswoman @entity52 told @entity69			1
" the overall intent of the rule was to preclude athletics departments ( from ) specific hosting groups , which were most commonly , gender specific			0
" the @entity50 did not say if it will look into the claims made against @entity10 in this court filing			2
" what is important to recognize about this rule , is that it is not about maintaining a level playing field -- all schools can afford to have all female recruiting club ( s ) -- it was passed to prevent sexual assaults , to create a healthier environment on campuses , " said @entity77 , associate professor of sport management at the @entity78			0
@entity88 has been an expert witness in three @entity91 civil suits involving sexual assaults by athletes , including the case at the @entity95 which led to the @entity50 's ban on female hostess recruiting parties			2
@entity10 responded to the motion seeking dismissal with a public statement : " the allegations that i did something wrong are simply not true			1
i have cooperated fully with the authorities in this matter but , out of respect for the legal process , i am not able to comment any further			0
" @entity2 declined to comment on an ongoing investigation , and so did @entity109 , where @entity10 was hired in january and is preparing for a much - anticipated first season			1
@entity109 , coming off the heels of the sexual abuse scandal of @entity113 , faced some criticism from victim advocates when @entity10 was hired , since the case involving @entity21 and others at @entity2 was n't yet resolved			1
the prosecutor in the criminal case has said that @entity10 cooperated with police and " there 's no evidence whatsoever where coach @entity10 was involved in any way in the cover - up or has done anything inappropriate			1
" the rest the motion from @entity21 's attorneys deals with allegations of misconduct against the prosecutors , whom @entity21 's attorneys say destroyed or lost evidence			2
@entity136 district attorney general @entity135 responded with a statement , saying : " the fact is , our office has given defense counsel for all four defendants complete access to the investigative file as the materials have become available			2
" he did not specifically deny whether there was an interview missing			2
among the things @entity21 's attorneys says he never got missing are text - message records and call logs of @entity151 , the alleged victim and other football staff members			1
the motion also alleges that @entity10 met with the woman in the hospital and told her he cared about her because she had assisted him with recruiting			0
it goes on to request interviews , police records , medical records and communication records			0
@entity21 is accused of taking an unconscious @entity2 woman into a building on campus on june 23			1
he allegedly was joined in his dorm room by three other now - former @entity2 football players also indicted on charges of rape : @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 , authorities said			1
all four were dismissed from the team following the allegation			0
they all have pleaded not guilty			1
@entity109 , when @entity10 was hired , said the university thoroughly vetted @entity10 and dismissed criticism that he was n't a good choice in the wake of the @entity113 scandal that ended the career of legendary coach @entity183 and the indictment of the @entity109 's former president , athletic director , and vice president for finance			0
but claims of a thorough vetting was n't enough to appease some critics			0
one of them was @entity192 , a victims advocate in @entity194 , who said wednesday that she believes @entity109 could not have known all the details in a fluid investigation like the one at @entity2			1
" it does n't make any rational sense for an institution coming off such a horrific scandal to then hire someone in the midst of a scandal himself , " storm said			0
in 2004 , after reports of women being assaulted at all - female recruiting parties , the @entity50 banned such gatherings , although news reports in the last 10 years painted a picture of them continuing to happen at schools .			0
