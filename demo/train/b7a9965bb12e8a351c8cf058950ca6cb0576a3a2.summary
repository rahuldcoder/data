-- a month and a half ago -- 46 days -- @entity1 vanished over the southern @entity2			1
the milestone is a somber one because it now allows attorneys to move in			0
there 's a 45 - day federal law that says @entity8 lawyers have to wait that long to reach out to a family that 's lost a loved one in a plane crash			1
what it means is that families can now file suit in @entity8 courts against @entity8 aircraft manufacturer @entity18 the only problem : no wreckage has been found			1
it 's kind of like a murder case without a body			0
some relatives of those on board the missing plane said they hope legal avenues can bring new information to light			1
" we do n't feel we have a whole lot of other choices because we 're certainly not getting any answers without ( legal action ) , " @entity31 , partner of flight 370 passenger @entity32 , told @entity0 on tuesday			2
the frustration among the families is that @entity40 officials give opinions , but no data , at their briefings			2
legal pressure on the @entity40 government , @entity31 said , might force it to release data it holds			0
attorneys have approached families about compensation lawsuits , but @entity31 said the feeling among the relatives is that they do not want to file lawsuits of that type to chase money			2
searching but ' no contacts of interest ' search efforts for @entity1 have repeatedly come up empty			1
the underwater drone scanning the ocean floor started its 10th mission on tuesday , but there have been " no contacts of interest " in the first nine , @entity61 's @entity60 said			1
the @entity68 has scanned about 80 % of the intended territory without finding any sign of @entity1			1
search leaders said the probe was still at work wednesday morning			1
" if we do n't have the ' black box ' with all the critical information on it , or we do n't have any part of the wreckage , it would be very hard to maintain a claim against @entity18 in any court in the @entity8 , " said aviation attorney @entity74 , a partner at the firm @entity75			0
some argue the @entity8 federal law barring attorneys ' contact with victims ' families for 45 days after an air disaster does not apply to crashes outside the @entity8			1
in fact , at least one law firm has already taken the initial steps for a lawsuit			0
aviation attorney @entity97 said she filed a request for documents and other information in an @entity102 court last month in a case against @entity104 and @entity18			0
she said she represents @entity105 , whose son was aboard flight 370			0
while it may be more difficult to make a case against @entity18 , the same ca n't be said for @entity104			0
the @entity110 governs such matters			0
under international law , families can sue in the country where the passengers bought the ticket , where the airline is based or their final destination			2
but the lawsuits and the money they may bring will never replace what families have lost or answer all their questions			2
sad , angry @entity1 relatives in agonizing limbo waiting for answers @entity104 representatives and government officials had scheduled a meeting tuesday with families of @entity133 passengers in @entity134 , but the session was postponed			1
relatives were told some @entity133 tech experts would probably talk to them instead			1
it was the second day in a row they had been disappointed , which only added to their frustration			0
on monday , the relatives wept , begged and cursed a @entity40 diplomat in @entity133 's capital			1
they went to a meeting at a hotel there , expecting a long - awaited briefing from @entity40 technical experts , but erupted in anger when the diplomat announced there would n't be one			2
" we do n't know at this point whether they are alive or dead			0
and you have n't given us any direct proof of where they actually are			0
we want our loved ones back , " a father of a missing passenger cried			1
drawing up a list relatives have drawn up 26 questions , many of them on technical issues , that they want @entity40 officials to address			0
among them : what 's in the flight 's log book ? can they review the jet 's maintenance records ? can they listen to recordings of the @entity177 pilot 's conversations with air traffic controllers just before contact was lost ? the diplomat said it 's hard to give families answers when they have so little information about the march 8 flight that set off from the @entity40 capital of @entity187 destined for @entity134			2
because of the plane 's flight path , most of the lawsuits against @entity104 would be filed in @entity133 or @entity40			1
the families of the three @entity8 who were on board the @entity177 can also sue @entity104 in @entity8 courts			0
@entity97 , an attorney at @entity195 , a firm that specializes in aviation accident cases , said she believes based on her experience that families could receive between $ 400,000 and $ 3 million in damages			0
however , it could take two years before they see the money , she said			0
