@entity0 , @entity1 -- the " barefoot bandit , " teenager @entity7 , was taken tuesday from the @entity4 to @entity0 to face charges , the @entity3 said			1
special agent @entity8 said he landed at 6:23 p.m. aboard an @entity11 flight on which the @entity3 was aboard , and will appear wednesday at 1:30 p.m. in federal court in @entity0			1
the 19 - year - old 's arrival occurred a few hours after he pleaded guilty in a @entity4 court to a charge of illegally landing a plane , paid a $ 300 fine and was ordered deported , his lawyer said			1
a federal law enforcement official said the $ 300 came from a program for @entity22 citizens abroad who are strapped for cash			1
@entity7 's lawyer , @entity24 , said her fee was being paid not by her client but by " an anonymous donor			1
" " he seems to be very remorseful , " the lawyer told @entity2 in a telephone interview from @entity30 about her client , who attended the court hearing wearing white sneakers , shorts and a t - shirt bearing the word " @entity4			1
" @entity7 was taken into custody on @entity38 in the @entity4 early sunday			1
he is sought in a string of home and airport break - ins in various @entity22 locations along with thefts of vehicles			1
asked whether he acknowledges guilt in the other cases , his lawyer said , " let me put it this way -- he wishes he had done things a little differently in his life			1
" still , she added , he appeared " in good spirits			1
" authorities in @entity56 , @entity57 , issued an arrest warrant for @entity7 last month on charges of burglary and theft by unlawful taking or deception			1
the affidavit supporting the warrant alleges the youth waged a crime spree			2
he faces charges in @entity69 in the theft of an aircraft , and police have said they believe he stole a @entity73 in @entity74 and flew it to the @entity4 , where it was found in the shallows off @entity77			2
the teen had been on the run since he escaped from a juvenile halfway house in @entity81 , @entity69 , in 2008			2
the @entity3 had offered a $ 10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest			1
typically in extradition cases , the accused makes a first appearance in the federal court closest to where he was arrested , said @entity91 , spokeswoman for the @entity92 in the @entity93 of @entity69			2
the @entity94 of @entity1 , in @entity0 , is the closest jurisdiction to the @entity4 , said @entity91			1
in his initial @entity22 appearance , he will be told of his rights and read an initial charge of interstate transportation of stolen property , @entity91 said			2
the complaint , which was sealed until last week , was filed last december and stems from his allegedly stealing a plane in @entity105 , @entity106 , and crashing it outside @entity107 , @entity69 , she said			1
@entity22 marshals will then take him to the @entity93 of @entity69 in @entity110			2
under the federal system , the case will then go to a grand jury			2
if an indictment is returned , more charges could be filed			2
the federal charge of interstate transportation of stolen goods carries a penalty of up to 10 years			2
federal prosecutors are working with other states to determine the best way to go forward in this case , but the @entity69 courts will get him first since he was arrested on their warrant , she said			0
@entity7 is called the " barefoot bandit " because he was without shoes when he allegedly broke into houses			1
he also was barefoot when apprehended in the @entity4 at the @entity131 and @entity132 by police responding to a reported sighting sunday			0
the youth has amassed more than 80,000 @entity137 fans			0
in december , @entity138 dubbed him " @entity139			0
" also , @entity140 has purchased the rights for a film based on his exploits			0
@entity131 officials said in a statement @entity7 arrived on @entity38 from the nearby island of @entity148 in a 15 - foot skiff			1
the marina 's security director , @entity150 , reported seeing him running down the dock about 2 a.m. sunday , carrying a gun			0
the young man told him , " they 're going to kill me , " @entity150 reported			0
he put out a call for help			0
guards disabled the skiff 's engine , but the young man attempted to steal a second boat , according to resort manager @entity161			0
however , he ran aground in the shallow water			0
authorities surrounded him and shot out the boat 's engines , @entity163 said			0
