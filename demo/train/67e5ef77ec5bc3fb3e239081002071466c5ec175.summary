as the class was preparing to read " @entity55 " to the president , chief of staff @entity52 whispered in @entity35 's ear that the @entity11 was under attack			1
minutes later , " he had to excuse himself to leave and he left the classroom , " said @entity58 , 16 , a junior at @entity59			1
" all of the kids were leaving early and there was a bunch of confusion and people scared and stuff			2
" the rest of the story is history			2
but the tale of 9/11 has been woven in and out of their young lives ever since that tuesday in september of 2001 , when the president came to visit			1
" i was really shocked because i did n't expect them to catch him at all because it 's been 10 years " @entity58 said of @entity21			1
but what they also did n't expect was the fast track to maturity that has come with their place in history			2

for @entity100 , the almost - 10 - year saga , and her place in that classroom on that fateful day , was surreal and amazing , she said			0
