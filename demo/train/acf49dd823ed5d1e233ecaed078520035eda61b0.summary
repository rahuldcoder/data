@entity0 -- @entity2 told @entity4 business leaders this week in @entity5 that he is convinced the " @entity8 is the rightful home of @entity4 , " but added that " my speech today is n't about my political party			1
unable to close ground on president @entity13 in the polls , the @entity8 challenger seeks to woo @entity4 voters but finds himself hindered by the conservative stance he took on immigration policy in order to win the @entity8 primary campaign			1
now , his opposition to @entity13 's move this summer to halt deportations of some children of illegal immigrants puts @entity2 at odds with a majority of @entity4 voters , especially younger ones in the fastest - growing demographic of the @entity31 population			1
facing a highly anticipated appearance on wednesday at the @entity34 " meet the candidates " forum in @entity35 , @entity2 has struggled to explain his stance on the issue because of the difference between what his party base demands and what most @entity4 @entity4 want to hear			2
opinion : @entity2 better off as a @entity4 ? he demonstrated his dilemma in an interview on monday with @entity48 - language @entity47 's @entity46			1
@entity2 lambasted @entity13 's economic policies in making the case for why the @entity4 electorate that traditionally backs @entity52 should vote for him this time			1
but he sounded uncomfortable when asked if he would continue the administration 's halt in deporting so - called dreamers -- young illegal immigrants brought to @entity57 as children who want to study and work in the country where they grew up			1
conservatives oppose the @entity13 program , calling it an amnesty that increases competition for scarce jobs			2
during the primary campaign , @entity2 said he opposed the @entity67 , a @entity52 proposal blocked by congressional @entity8 , but also called for an unspecified @entity8 version that has yet to emerge from the party or his campaign			1
" i 'm going to make sure that we have a permanent solution to help dreamers , to help these young people who came to this country through no fault of their own , brought here by their parents , " @entity2 told @entity46 , adding that " i want them to understand what their permanent status is			2
and from the very beginning of my administration , i will work to put in place legislation that is -- that deals with the major immigration issues that @entity57 faces , including that one			0
" he repeated his past intention to provide a pathway to permanent residency for those who served in the military , adding he would work with @entity93 to find a " reasonable solution			0
" when @entity46 then asked what happens in a @entity2 administration to the hundreds of thousands who would benefit from the @entity13 program , @entity2 responded : " well , i 'm going to put in place an immigration reform proposal that makes sure that they have a solution			1
" would that mean dreamers get deported , @entity46 asked , to which @entity2 replied : " well , they 're -- they 're -- they 're not deported immediately today			0
and -- and that 's not , that has not been the practice			0
my practice is to make sure these people have a permanent understanding and a solution to this issue			0
" weak standing among @entity4 voters to @entity1 contributor @entity118 , a @entity4 @entity8 , such equivocation contributes to @entity2 's weak standing among @entity4 voters			1
the @entity122 weekly tracking poll reported monday that @entity13 held a 68 % -26 % advantage over @entity2 among @entity4			1
" @entity2 needs to move beyond his positions during the primary , " @entity125 wrote in an online commentary			2
" he promised to veto the @entity67			0
he should then tell us if and how he plans to confront the predicament these young people face			0
" in particular , @entity125 asked if a president @entity2 would revoke or let stand @entity13 's administrative order providing dreamers with a two - year reprieve from possible deportation , adding : " a simple yes or no will suffice			1
" @entity137 , the director of civic engagement for the @entity139 , agreed that @entity2 needs to clarify his position to have any chance of making headway with @entity4 voters			1
" the question is what would a @entity2 administration do ? " @entity137 told @entity1 , adding that @entity13 can strengthen his position by hammering @entity2 on the dreamer deportation issue " because @entity2 has not come up with a specific position			2
" according to the @entity151 poll , immigration is the second-most important issue to @entity4 voters , behind the economy			1
with the november vote likely to be decided in nine battleground states considered toss - ups at this point , the @entity4 demographic could be crucial in some tightly contested races			0
for example , @entity161 's 15 electoral votes are up for grabs in a state @entity13 won by 14,177 votes four years ago			2
with more than 182,000 eligible @entity4 voters in the state , according to the @entity122 website , the presidential breakdown could play a major role in determining who wins			1
gaining traction with @entity4 voters requires the same kind of campaigning as any other demographic , @entity137 said			1
" the prescription is not much different , " she said , advocating outreach and building relationships			0
" the question is the substance			0
what are the issues and what are you saying about them ? " for both @entity2 and @entity13 , " answering some of these lingering questions would help the outreach go further , " @entity137 said			2
" you give voters specificity so they have something to vote for and not just something to vote against			0
" can @entity2 connect with @entity4 voters ? immigration advisers another issue of concern to @entity4 voters involves @entity2 's advisers on immigration , @entity137 said , noting concerns about the role that @entity198 secretary of state @entity199 could play in a @entity2 administration			1
@entity199 , the architect of tough immigration laws in @entity203 and @entity204 , says he has been advising @entity2 for years , and the @entity2 campaign described him as an " informal adviser			2
" however , @entity2 told @entity207 on monday that he had never met with @entity199			0
" he may well be part of a policy team , " @entity2 said			0
" i have not met with him yet			0
and do n't know whether he is or he is not			0
" in january , @entity2 expressed gratitude when the conservative @entity199 endorsed him for the @entity8 nomination			1
" i 'm so proud to earn @entity199 's support , " he said in a statement at the time			0
" @entity199 has been a true leader on securing our borders and stopping the flow of illegal immigration into this country			0
we need more conservative leaders like @entity199 willing to stand up for the rule of law			0
" in another past comment that could draw fire this week , @entity2 acknowledged at a private fundraiser in may the difficulty @entity8 have in winning support from @entity4 voters			1
a secretly recorded video of @entity2 's remarks shows him saying that " if the @entity4 voting bloc becomes as committed to the ( @entity52 ) as the @entity57 voting bloc , then we are in trouble as a party and i think as a nation			2
" share your thoughts on @entity2 with @entity239 @entity1 's @entity240 and @entity241 contributed to this report .			0
