-- a traditional grand conclave of elders , a @entity3 , convenes thursday in @entity4 , @entity5 , to decide whether @entity7 forces can remain in the country past 2014			1
but events this past weekend illustrated the continuing perils and myopia of @entity7 policy			2
on saturday , just a few hundred yards from the site of thursday 's critical meeting , expected to be attended by 2,500 people , a car bomb exploded , killing at least 13 people			2
at the same time , at @entity24 in @entity25 , former first ladies @entity22 and @entity23 took the stage together to exhort @entity7 not to abandon the women of @entity5			2
former secretary of state @entity28 stated that it is essential the @entity7 continue to play a role in the country to provide the security necessary for continued progress for @entity5 women and girls			1
@entity7 reconstruction of @entity5 is the most expensive reconstruction of a single country in @entity7 history , costing more than $ 90 billion to date			1
the @entity7 has given more to @entity5 than any other single country during the @entity41 after @entity42 year , @entity5 received almost twice as much as the next four largest foreign assistance country beneficiaries combined			2
with about 2,300 @entity7 service members killed in this effort , the loss to @entity7 families has also been incalculable			2
yet , with all this sacrifice , the @entity7 is not meaningfully closer to the goals @entity22 , @entity23 and the @entity51 administration have asked us to embrace			0
while our political leaders laud that progress and the need for a continued @entity7 military presence , the @entity19 respond with more bombs and more innocent lives are lost			1
@entity3 approves @entity7 - @entity5 security deal ; asks @entity60 to sign hopes now for any kind of peace in @entity5 largely depend on @entity64			1
after the @entity3 , a delegation of the @entity66 will reportedly visit @entity67 to meet @entity64 in a renewed push to end the decades ' long conflict			0
@entity64 , once the top deputy to @entity19 supreme leader @entity70 , was freed from jail in @entity67 in september at the request of the @entity5 government to help facilitate the peace process			1
@entity70 has denounced the @entity3 and the @entity19 opposes any @entity7 troops remaining			1
having interviewed @entity64 's assistant and other @entity19 fighters and leaders , it is clear that their worldview is as far from the @entity7 ' and the largely @entity82 - educated elite we rely on to run @entity5 as ever			1
in the world of @entity70 , @entity64 and many of the @entity19 leaders , their path is driven by the power of religious visions and dreams			0
each " true night dream " is nothing less than a prophecy of @entity93			0
and each leader 's authority comes from @entity93			0
the seminal event in sealing @entity70 's authority as unquestioned leader happened in april 1996			0
then , in the dusty southern @entity101 stronghold of @entity102 , @entity70 donned , from a religious shrine , the holy relic of the cloak of the @entity106			0
after the initial @entity7 victory in @entity5 at the end of 2001 , @entity70 and @entity64 retreated to @entity109 , in @entity67			2
as recounted to me by someone in @entity70 's inner circle , the @entity64 was devastated by the @entity19 's defeat			0
paralyzed with inaction , @entity70 could not decide what to do , waiting patiently for another " true night dream " from @entity93			0
as a result , @entity64 helped to direct a meeting in the spring of 2002 at a madrassa in @entity109 with @entity70 's favorite seer			0
it was only after the @entity19 seer recounted a dream in which he saw @entity70 's " beard turn a blinding white -- for it was now made of the threads of the holy prophet 's very cloak " that @entity70 decided to lead the fight again against the @entity7 inside @entity5			1
this is the same @entity64 upon which peace talks now substantially depend			0
while our @entity5 allies hold the @entity3 to decide the fate of a continued @entity7 military presence in the country , their @entity19 enemies deliver their response with more bombs			1
and while the @entity7 continues to invest unprecedented resources into a largely corrupt and feckless @entity5 government , the @entity19 leaders wait for dreams			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			0

a @entity3 council meets in @entity5 to decide if @entity7 troops may stay past 2014
@entity147 : in @entity19 *message* to @entity3 , a bombing killed 13 near meeting site
@entity147 : @entity5 security depends on talks with a leader of @entity19 , which denounces @entity7 presence
@entity147 : @entity7 spent $ 90 billion in @entity5 , the @entity19 is *resurgent* , our goals still unmet
