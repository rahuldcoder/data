-- with @entity2 dead , fans everywhere are mourning , celebrating , tallying up bets and discussing what just happened			1
was the series finale of " @entity6 " satisfying ? did it tie up all loose ends ? did the character you wanted to live survive and did the ones you wanted to die get their just deserts ? is it sending you back to the beginning to binge watch it all over again ? just when it seemed @entity19 was heading out of his @entity21 hideaway to exact revenge on @entity23 and @entity24 ( for dismissing his involvement with @entity26 in the episode previous ) , he pulled the first of several surprises of the evening			1
instead of threatening to kill them outright , he asks them to set up a trust fund so that his children would benefit from the money he 'd illegally amassed ( presumably the goal of his entire meth enterprise to begin with )			0
@entity24 and @entity39 of course are terrified by his sudden appearance in their ritzy new home , but had they been paying attention , they would have seen @entity19 waltz on in			1
his entrance is a bit ironic , considering their wealth and legitimacy is in some way a result of his earlier contributions			0
he 's always been there , in the shadows , whether they acknowledged him or not			2
@entity58 , man of the moment @entity19 wants them to " make it right , " but of course , he knows he ca n't trust them to take care of his kids on a handshake alone , so he brought backup -- two " hitmen " who shine sniper - style red lights on the @entity70 to lend credibility to @entity19 's threat that if for any reason his children do n't receive the money , " a kind of countdown begins , " in which they would be killed			1
it 's a bluff , but they do n't know that , so it 's a win - win			2
@entity19 's children will get the money in a semi-legal fashion , and no one will actually die in the process			1
that 's not to say @entity19 's above taking a life or two ( or more ) on his way out			1
as he progresses down the list of necessary showdowns , @entity19 crashes a regularly scheduled meeting with @entity92 and @entity93 ( " 10 a.m. , every tuesday " ) and slips a little something extra in @entity93 's morning coffee via what she thinks is her favorite sugar substitute @entity97 -- actually the long - awaited use of his ricin , made back in season four			1
with the lingering close - up on her cup , we know long before she starts getting flu - like symptoms that she 's doomed			2
and it 's been inevitable for a long time that @entity19 would finally successfully use the ricin on somebody , it was just a question of how and when			1
by the time @entity93 realizes that her humidifier is not enough , she 's only got about one day left to live			2
' @entity6 ' creator signs deal for @entity116 drama thinking that @entity117 has partnered with the @entity118 , @entity19 preps for his ultimate showdown , but he has one last detour to make -- to see his wife @entity121 and their kids			1
" i needed a proper goodbye , " he tells her , after it 's revealed he evaded her police protection and slipped in her new home as well			0
she refuses his money , and he gives her the lotto ticket with the coordinates of where @entity132 is buried , of where his money used to be			0
" if i have to hear one more time that you did this for the family , " she starts , before he finally tells the truth : " i did it for me			0
i was good at it			0
" he gets a glimpse of @entity144 and @entity145 , but he has one last threat to take care of , so that men in masks do n't come and threaten his family anymore in the night			0
@entity19 must have known that he would n't leave this last altercation alive , but once he realized that @entity117 was not a partner but a prisoner of the neo-nazis , he does his last good deed , and protects @entity117 from the barrage of machine gun fire set to emanate from his trunk , throwing him down on the ground just below the firing line			1
and finally , it comes down to the two of them			0
@entity19 puts down his gun , and @entity117 picks it up			1
opinion : ' @entity6 ' is watching you " do it , " @entity19 tells him			1
" " say you want this , " @entity117 demands			2
" nothing happens until i hear you say it			0
" " i want this , " @entity19 concedes			2
and then @entity117 drops the gun and tells him , " then do it yourself			2
" after all the grief and pain of their partnership , @entity19 and @entity117 do n't kill each other			1
they do n't hug it out			0
they leave each other with a nod and a semi-smile , and poor scarred and tortured @entity117 presumably gets to go and actually have a life			1
( maybe with @entity189 ? the kid needs a parental figure , stat )			0
chemistry is the study of transformation , as " @entity6 " has repeatedly reminded us			0
mr. @entity196 turned into scarface - level meth kingpin and died of a gunshot wound from his own device , as police arrived to arrest him for his many crimes			0
was @entity19 always @entity202 ? was @entity202 only a creation out of necessity ? would @entity19 have allowed @entity205 to die if his criminal enterprise were not threatened ? would @entity19 have poisoned a child if he did n't need to take down a major rival ? and is his death " justice ? " @entity212 fix for ' @entity6 ' addicts : ' @entity214 ' we 've all seen @entity2 's death coming			1
it was merely a question of whether his cancer or his criminal activity would get him first			0
with @entity19 coughing all the way , we 've had ample warning			2
this antihero was not long for this world			0
it took five seasons , but in @entity19 's world , it was two years , two long years in which a baby was born , a psychopath was made , a @entity233 agent finally saw the light ( albeit too late ) and a mild - mannered chemistry teacher learned what it took to make him feel alive			1
of course , not every loose end is tied off , but for now , it 's enough			0
that is , until the inevitable " @entity214 " spinoff .			0

@entity2 made several surprising moves in the finale
@entity19 's final confrontation was with his partner @entity117
the hit @entity212 show took five seasons to cover two years of @entity2 's life
