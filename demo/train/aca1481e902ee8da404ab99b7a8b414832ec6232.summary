if you 're planning to donate sperm in @entity2 , you may want to do it through a doctor			1
that 's one message from the case of @entity8 of @entity9			1
in 2009 , he noticed a @entity12 advertisement from a lesbian couple , also in @entity9 , seeking donated sperm			1
" intrigued " by the ad , he agreed to donate and says he delivered three cupfuls of his sperm -- gratis -- to the women , one of whom gave birth to a daughter			2
" i donated genetic material , and that was it for me , " he told @entity25 affiliate @entity23			1
that changed when the parents separated and one of the women stopped working because of illness and applied to the state for help , he said			0
the state contacted @entity8 for child support			1
@entity2 officials were not persuaded by what @entity8 says were agreements he signed before making his donations that he would assume no financial responsibility for the child , who is now 3 years old			1
the @entity45 said any agreement would not apply because a physician did not perform the insemination , which @entity8 said was news to him			1
" i did n't know that there was no doctor involved , " @entity8 said friday			1
his lawyer , @entity52 , accused the state , where same - sex marriage is not legal , of being politically motivated in its pursuit of $ 6,000 from his client			0
" the cost to the state to bring this case far outweighs any benefit the state would get , " he said			2
@entity8 said he met the child once -- a few months ago -- when he and his wife by chance crossed paths with one of the girl 's parents at an area carnival			1
he said he had no intention of assuming a paternal role if he loses the case			2
" i 'm not her parent , " he said			0
but under @entity2 law , he is her father			2
had a physician carried out the insemination , that would not be the case , because @entity8 would be able to document that he was a sperm donor and not the lover of the girl 's mother , said @entity25 senior medical correspondent @entity84			1
" for all they know , they were lovers , " she said			0
" they need that documentation			0
he 's the dad ; he ought to be paying up			0
" though a physician would have tested the sperm for sexually transmitted diseases and certain genetic disorders , there are disincentives associated with going through a physician			0
a single attempt at artificial insemination costs about $ 3,000 , and sometimes several tries are needed			0
" it 's a lot cheaper to get someone to come on over with their donation , and then do it yourself at home , " @entity84 said			0
meanwhile , @entity8 owes legal fees and has taken his story to the news media			2
" if enough noise gets made about it , at this point , maybe things will change for the better , " he said			0
asked whether , knowing what he now knows , he would answer the advertisement again , @entity8 said , " probably not			2
" a different kind of fatherhood			0

" i donated genetic material and that was it for me , " @entity8 says
@entity2 says he should have gone through a doctor
the case started with an ad on @entity12
