" so , how can we promote @entity1 as a safe destination in the foreign media in the midst of the current @entity6 situation ? " that was the question posed by a @entity1 government foreign public relations representative at a meeting on monday , even as @entity11 continued its militaristic rhetoric , announcing on the same day that @entity6 is pulling workers out of a joint @entity15 industrial zone			1
fearing both short and long term drops in tourism , the @entity1 government was seeking advice at a meeting it requested with @entity6 expert @entity20 , a professor at @entity1 's @entity21			1
" it 's a very important question , but the problem is that the foreign media believes @entity6 's threats when they should not , " said @entity20 , who has been studying @entity6 for almost 30 years			2
throughout the meeting , which took place in @entity20 's office , the professor ignored his mobile phone and office land line , even as both rang incessantly			0
" journalists , " he said , shaking his head			0
@entity20 advised the @entity1 government to bombard the media with images showing how the day to day lives of @entity37 have remained unaffected by @entity6 threats , and how its residents remain unconcerned by the hostile rhetoric			1
" negative impact on @entity37 tourism and the @entity37 economy is exactly what @entity6 wants , " said @entity20 , who is adamant in his belief that @entity6 wo n't attack the @entity15			2
" [ @entity6 leader ] @entity47 is living a wonderful life that is better than any conglomerate owner 's life in @entity37 -- why would he want to cut that short ? " said the @entity6 expert			0
" he is therefore the one person @entity37 can truly depend on to not go to war , " @entity20 concluded			0
impact on @entity37 tourism it seems logical that tourism in @entity1 , and all of @entity37 , would suffer in the wake of the hostile rhetoric from the @entity6 government			1
@entity1 is located just 190 kilometers ( 118 miles ) from @entity11 , well within range of hundreds if not thousands of @entity6 artillery and missile units			1
@entity6 : our global fear and fascination however , no country has yet issued alerts or warnings concerning travel to @entity37			0
" @entity72 has not changed its security posture and we have not recommended that @entity75 citizens who reside in , or plan to visit , the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) take special security precautions at this time , " reads a statement posted on the @entity70 in @entity1 's website			1
there 's no denying , however , that some travelers are altering their plans			0
" we had two colleagues in @entity84 who decided to push back their business trip to @entity1 because of the @entity6 crisis , " said @entity80 , a @entity81 risk manager at a multinational bank			2
@entity80 , who arrived in @entity1 two weeks ago on business , told @entity88 she does n't believe the threats pose a danger			1
her colleagues , however , are getting more nervous about the situation with each news report			0
" they say they will come only after it all blows over , " she said			0
record month despite concerns , tourism numbers in @entity37 are up			0
last week , the @entity99 ( @entity99 ) announced a record number of visitors for the month of march			0
for the first time in history , inbound international tourists numbered more than a million -- an 11.9 % increase compared with the same month last year			1
numbers for april wo n't be available until may			0
" we 've had record numbers from every country except @entity110 and @entity111 , " @entity99 's @entity107 told @entity88			0
according to @entity107 , tourist numbers are impacted by geopolitics , but not necessarily those involving @entity6			0
" many of the @entity117 tourists who would have been visiting @entity110 are now coming to @entity37 due to the island disputes between @entity117 and @entity110 , " said @entity107			1
@entity117 , @entity110 swap barbs over disputed islands approximately 12,000 visitors per day are currently entering @entity37 on cruises from @entity117 , according to the @entity99			2
business as usual at @entity124 @entity37 's largest airline , @entity126 , and several major hotels in @entity1 , tell @entity88 there has been no noticeable dip in bookings			1
" we have not seen any impact from the news from @entity6 thus far , but we 'll have to see about any further impact , " a @entity126 public relations representative told @entity88			0
this past weekend at @entity137 , an area within the @entity138 ( @entity124 ) popular with tourists , business appeared down only slightly			1
though parking lots were jammed with @entity117 tour groups and @entity6 families on day trips , the @entity124 appeared to have fewer @entity145 visitors than usual			1
" we 've seen around a 20 % decrease in business , but it 's not too bad , " said @entity146 , 57 , who has been selling hot dogs at the @entity124 for 30 years			1
" there was a similar drop in visitors when the @entity158 shelling happened , " he said , referring to the 2010 incident when two civilians and two @entity37 marines died after a @entity6 attack			0
@entity99 's @entity124 office said tours were operating normally			2
the @entity99 was unable to provide specific @entity124 visitor data			2
" we are not afraid at all ! " said a member of a group of tourists from @entity165 , @entity117 , when asked why they 'd decided to visit the @entity124 in the midst of current reports			1
" there will be only peace here			0
" according to professor @entity20 , there 's a reason @entity117 tourists are unruffled by the threats from @entity6			1
according to the @entity6 expert , @entity117 media is n't reporting on the situation in dire tones			2
he said @entity117 reporters have n't adopted the posture of their @entity145 counterparts , " like @entity88 and @entity182 , as if war is going to break out			2
