@entity0 , @entity1 -- big - box stores are stealing @entity4 , and their workers are n't happy about it			1
after @entity7 decreed that @entity8 would start at midnight @entity4 night and that employees must report to work at 11 p.m. , an @entity12 worker , @entity13 , posted a petition at @entity15 asking the company to move the official start of @entity19 shopping back to 5 a.m. friday			1
response from workers and others has been stellar : 192,000 signatures by monday			1
@entity24 will also be opening at midnight , so @entity25 , a @entity26 employee , posted a similar petition			1
it currently has 14,000 signatures			2
why did this hit such a nerve ? @entity13 's petition says , " a full holiday with family is not just for the elite of this nation -- all @entity37 should be able to break bread with loved ones and get a good night 's rest on @entity4 ! " but he will have to cut out on the family to grab some sleep , because he 'll be up all night working			1
@entity25 told @entity43 that @entity24 will be showing a @entity45 movie to customers camped outside , so some employees will have to report to work by 8 p.m. to set up			0
@entity49 is the leader in this year 's great race to gobble up employee turkey time			0
it announced its opening at 10 p.m. thursday			2
since two - thirds of @entity49 's hourly workers are women , many will arrive exhausted after cooking the family feast			1
@entity37 already work longer hours than in most countries , and as incomes shrink , lots of low - wage workers have multiple jobs			2
many families ' work schedules make it impossible to have weekends or even dinner together			0
that 's why holidays provide the only opportunity for so many extended families to see each other			0
our current obsession with corporate values , however , leaves no space for human values anymore			0
the just - in - time workforce means just no time for the family			2
if these workers had unions , companies would have had to negotiate these schedule changes and a lot else too , but the retail giants hate unions worse than missing @entity8			1
just last summer , @entity7 workers in @entity89 tried unsuccessfully to get a union			1
their last pay increase amounted to eight cents , according to the union			0
@entity7 did all it could to get the no vote , including a veiled threat to close the store			2
it 's @entity49 that sets the pace in union busting			0
one former employee told me that when @entity49 found out he was trying to organize at his store in @entity102 , it assigned him his own personal supervisor , who stuck to him like glue			0
a january 2011 report by @entity106 and @entity107 found that @entity49 is also the leader in driving down wages and working conditions for the nation 's 14.4 million retail workers			2
the median hourly retail wage is $ 10.58 , which is considerably less than the median for all workers of $ 15.95			0
without unions , workers have no leverage to get raises or even livable schedules			2
but retailers say they ca n't help it			0
shoppers are the ones demanding that workers sacrifice @entity4			1
a @entity7 spokeswoman says , " we have heard from our guests that they want to shop @entity7 following their @entity4 celebrations rather than only having the option of getting up in the middle of the night			1
" you 'd think these box - full - of - billions retailers are just little mom - and - pop corner stores at the mercy of shoppers ' whims when in fact the biggest eight of them control 85 % of the general merchandise market			1
a @entity141 representative says shoppers will " dedicate themselves manically to finding the best deal			0
" pitting shoppers against workers is much easier than looking into why shoppers sometimes act like mobs or why workers want some voice in their work lives			0
in fact , big - box shoppers and workers have a lot in common			1
most are barely getting by			0
a recent study of @entity49 found that 28 % of sales are to people making less than 200 % of the federal poverty line ( $ 44,100 in 2010 for a family of four )			0
meanwhile , 22 % of @entity49 workers make less than $ 9 an hour , and 64 % make less than $ 12			0
while some @entity8 shoppers may indeed be fixated on the cheapest new @entity163 game system , even more have to stretch their slim paychecks just to buy necessities for the family plus an occasional toy			0
one retail employee , commenting at the @entity24 petition site , suggested that the company take out an ad and say it 's giving @entity4 back , but it 'll be open friday and all weekend with great deals			1
show some leadership , appeal to something besides greed and reverse the trend			1
that study of @entity49 showed that raising workers ' minimum wage to $ 12 would have minimum impact on prices , even if @entity49 passes all its increased costs on to consumers			0
it suggested that cities set minimum wages and standards for big - box stores			1
some communities are passing community benefits agreements to set standards for big - box stores			1
to get these things , and also long - overdue labor law reform , we need more workers willing to stand up like petitioners @entity13 and @entity25 and the @entity89 @entity7 workers , and we need consumers to recognize that they 're workers , too , and that paying the lowest prices has a hidden cost for their children and our society			1
that cost is less opportunity for good jobs , more job offshoring and an ever - declining standard of living			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			2

big - box stores are stealing @entity4 , and their workers are n't happy , @entity212 says
a petition to *prevent* @entity7 stores from opening at midnight has 192,000 signatures
@entity221 : if these workers had unions , companies would have to negotiate schedule changes
show some leadership , appeal to something besides greed and reverse the trend , @entity221 says
