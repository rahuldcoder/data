-- crushing a string of opponents before dispatching @entity4 in four sets in the @entity7 final , @entity1 was back to his ruthless best , with not a hint of the injury problems which have threatened to blight his career , even during a year which has seen him claim two grand slams			1
but the @entity13 has admitted to @entity0 that he had real fears that as he made yet another comeback he would fall short of his own incredible standards			0
" sure i had doubts , everyone has doubts , " said the 27 - year - old @entity17			0
" when you are injured you doubt if you going to be able to come back and play at 100 %			0
" closing fast on @entity4 's @entity23 spot , @entity1 has spent two lengthy spells on the sidelines through knee injuries , both times making a strong comeback			1
returning to the @entity29 in february , @entity1 clicked straight into gear , culminating in his eighth victory in the @entity32			2
but come @entity33 his battered body could take no further punishment and @entity1 was a shadow of his normal self as he crashed out in the first round to unheralded @entity39 , clearly troubled by knee problems			1
the doubters were out in force again and with @entity1 sidelined yet again , @entity4 and @entity33 champion @entity43 were predicted to share the grand slams between them in the foreseeable future			1
they were reckoning without @entity1 's incredible determination and joining the circuit again for the pre @entity7 hard court series , the @entity17 looked as if he had never been away , claiming titles in @entity51 and @entity52 before his @entity54 triumph			1
the mixture of joy and relief were there for all to see as @entity1 savored every moment on the @entity60 in claiming his 13th career grand slam			1
" when you are coming back after low moments victories are all the more special and more emotional , " @entity1 admitted			2
" i enjoy it now because in a few years i wo n't have the chance to play like i did in the @entity7 final			2
" the manner of his victory suggested that @entity1 could easily outstrip all - time grand slam record holder @entity70 , who has 17 in his trophy room			1
but always at the back of @entity1 's mind is the possibility his knee tendon problem might flare up again so he is taking nothing for granted			1
" we need our knees , without our knees it is impossible to play well , sometimes i still have pain , but the most important thing is that at the moment i am able to play without limitations , " said the newly crowned @entity7 champion			2
@entity1 has been a force on the circuit for approaching a decade since bursting to prominence as a precocious teenager , particularly on his favorite clay surface			0
his all action game was an immediate crowd pleaser but he admits that he takes a more measured approach these days			0
" when you are a kid you are able to play with a different style , crazy jumping and all that , " added @entity1			0
" that moment has passed but my love and passion for the game is still the same			0
" all that spells bad news for those battling him at the elite end of the men 's game with plenty to play for still in 2013 , including the @entity109 in @entity110 , just about the only title which has eluded him .			0
