since 1848 , @entity0 has been where @entity2 soldiers toil , train and sweat under the strong @entity6 sun before departing for battlegrounds around the world			1
it has also been where their loved ones grieve upon hearing the worst possible news from the war front -- including in 52 cases over eight years of fighting in @entity14			1
such heart - wrenching returns from that @entity18 nation will soon become history			0
president @entity20 announced friday that the vast majority of the more than 39,000 @entity2 troops now stationed in @entity14 , including about 3,500 from @entity0 , " will definitely be home for the holidays			1
" the decision set off shrieks and tears of joy among family members of the deployed troops			0
" everybody was yelling and screaming and clapping and crying , " recalled @entity31 , whose husband , @entity32 , deployed in july			0
" it was very emotional			2
" extreme highs and lows are nothing new for military spouses like @entity38 , who is the daughter of a 28 - year @entity40			2
her husband -- a medic for the 4th brigade of the @entity44 , which is based at @entity0 -- has been in the military for five years			1
@entity38 said there are plenty of headaches and heartache for her and the couple 's children every time her husband sets off for such countries as @entity14 and @entity55			1
some of it stems from suddenly becoming a single parent , and then there 's the looming nightmare of possibly never seeing her husband alive again			2
" it 's always a worry , " @entity38 said			2
" you just have to take it one day at a time			0
" like @entity38 , @entity65 expected the day she could finally breathe -- when her husband , @entity66 , was finally back in her arms -- would come in july			0
that would have marked 12 months after the husband was first deployed to @entity14			2
@entity65 said the separation has been difficult			0
the rest of her family is 2,000 miles away in @entity73 , and she found herself forced to become " the man and the woman of the house " when problems , like a broken toilet , arose			0
she believes @entity20 's decision is the right one			1
the decision came after talks with the @entity14 about extending the @entity2 troop presence broke down over the key issue of legal immunity for @entity2 military personnel			1
the campaign has claimed more than 4,400 @entity2 lives and has cost upwards of $ 700 billion , according to the @entity90			0
" it 's been too long , " @entity65 said			0
@entity92 does n't think her husband , @entity93 , should return to @entity14 , either			2
he is a petroleum specialist who deployed for the first time in august , less than a month after arriving at @entity0 , which covers roughly 1.1 million acres of land in southern @entity98 and @entity99			2
" it 's been eight years , so i feel like it 's about time , " she said of the @entity14 war			1
@entity92 added she is " ecstatic " that her husband should be home in time to celebrate his 21st birthday , and she is eager to cook him his favorite meal of pork chops			0
but she and other @entity0 families know , too , that while their loved ones may not head back to @entity14 , that does not mean they wo n't face more danger			1
while thousands of personnel from the army base are now in @entity14 , more -- about 5,000 -- are in @entity55			1
even as her mind races at " a million miles an hour " in anticipation of her husband 's imminent return , @entity38 said she 's trying not to lose the perspective that comes with life as a military spouse			1
" it 's the army , " @entity38 said			0
" you do n't know what tomorrow is going to hold			0
you just do the best you can			0
" @entity65 said that she 's heard some @entity0 troops might go from @entity14 to @entity128 and eventually end up in @entity55			1
but she said that , for now , she is trying to enjoy the fact that her husband will be home , and can not bring herself to consider yet that he may be in harm 's way again , this time in @entity55			1
" that 's not an option in my mind , " she said .			0

@entity0 is home to the @entity137 's @entity44 and has 3,500 personnel in @entity14

a military spouse says " it was very emotional " when she and others heard the news
she and others are happy , while *cognizant* their loved ones could head to @entity55
