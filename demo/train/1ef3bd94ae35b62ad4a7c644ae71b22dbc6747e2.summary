@entity0 is as old as kidnappings , bad guys and money			0
but it never gets old enough not to demand again , as the @entity7 government now knows all too well			1
in a video posted tuesday to social media , a black - clad @entity9 militant stood over two men he said were @entity7 citizens			1
both would die , he said , unless the @entity7 government paid the @entity15 extremist group $ 200 million within 72 hours			1
that @entity9 wants ransom is n't unexpected			1
but a few things -- like the public nature and staggering amount of the request -- make it stand out			0
it 's hard to quantify all the examples , because hostage takers in ambitious militant groups like @entity9 rarely make their demands public			1
but just as kidnappings are the norm for such groups , so is asking for ransom			0
one documented example is the case of @entity33 , an @entity34 journalist abducted in northern @entity35 in november 2012			0
@entity9 would later demand 100 million euros ( about $ 132 million ) for his release , said @entity38 , a spokesman for the news website @entity40 that @entity33 freelanced for before			1
neither @entity40 , nor @entity33 's family , nor the @entity34 government paid that amount			0
even if they had , there 's no telling if @entity9 would have kept its word and freed @entity33			2
instead , the group not only beheaded @entity33 , but recorded his killing and put it online for the world to see			0
one thing that makes the latest ransom request unique is that @entity9 made it publicly and set a three - day deadline for it to be met			1
this suggests as much posturing as fundraising , especially when coupled with its decrying @entity7 for supporting governments involved in the @entity61 fight ( even if @entity62 is n't part of the international military coalition going against it )			2
@entity9 ' rationale seems similar to other terror groups : kidnappings help raise money and , if ransoms are n't paid , make a point , such as the groups are not to be messed with and even civilians are in danger			1
rationalizing the public relations strategy of a group like @entity9 can be a challenge			2
but there 's no doubt the group uses modern technology to get the word out on its captives , including when they are beheaded			0
such pictures further the image of @entity9 as a ruthless , defiant organization dedicated to wiping out anyone -- soldiers or civilians -- who does n't follow its extreme conservative version of @entity92 law			2
the money - making aspect is more under the radar , but still significant			0
the @entity95 estimated in 2012 that @entity96 and its affiliates ( which do n't include @entity9 , though the terror groups have similarities ) compiled $ 120 million from ransoms over the previous eight years			1
and a @entity102 investigative piece from july 2014 determined that @entity96 and its affiliates took in $ 125 million since 2008 , including $ 66 million in 2013 alone			2
there has n't been a similarly detailed review for @entity9 , but that does n't mean ransoms -- in addition to things like oil revenues , criminal enterprises as well as taxes , tolls and other fees imposed on those in its territories -- are n't a significant part of the group 's budget			2
countries do n't advertise how much they pay in ransom ; doing so could invite kidnappers to seize their citizens for ransom			1
but that does n't mean some countries do n't do it			0
the summer 2014 @entity102 article , citing @entity129 media reports , identified @entity129 as the country that pays out the most to @entity96 affiliates			0
@entity129 's reported $ 58 million figure , since 2008 , is far higher than the next - highest total , $ 20 million , as paid out from @entity135 and @entity136			1
the @entity102 reports that @entity137 paid out $ 12 million , @entity138 $ 11 million and @entity139 $ 3 million in the same time frame			1
it 's not just @entity96 that @entity129 has dealt with : four @entity129 journalists taken captive by @entity9 were released last april			2
a group 's ransom request could depend on a lot of factors			2
a high - profile hostage , for instance , could demand a higher price			0
and a solitary kidnapper may ask less than one belonging to a large , powerful , defiant group -- especially one , like @entity9 , that 's proved its willingness to kill civilians			2
the amount of ransom requested and paid apparently has gone up			1
a decade ago , the @entity102 reported that a standard asking price might be $ 200,000			0
nowadays , it 's more likely to be in the millions			0
@entity158 , @entity40 's ceo , told @entity1 that @entity160 governments have paid between $ 2 million and $ 4 million for hostages			1
but it is not $ 200 million , as was requested for the two @entity7 hostages			1
nor is it the $ 132 million requested for @entity33			1
both figures from @entity9 are exceedingly high and seem to suggest the group is as interested in making a point ( and killing its captives ) as it is in making money , given the unlikelihood it will be paid			1
on tuesday , @entity7 prime minister @entity171 did not rule out paying a ransom or negotiating with his two citizens ' captors			1
does that mean @entity62 is willing to pay , or at least , talk ? not necessarily			0
@entity7 has n't said it has paid ransoms before , and there 's no reason to think the country would in this case			1
@entity7 signed a 2013 @entity182 communique that stated , " we unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists , and we call on countries and companies around the world to follow our lead to stamp this out			2
" this policy mirrors those of the @entity194 and the @entity34 , with @entity33 's mother , @entity195 , telling @entity1 that a @entity34 official once threatened her with prosecution if she tried to raise ransom on her own			0
why would n't countries like these two and @entity7 tap into their relatively vast resources to save the lives of their citizens ? for one thing , groups like @entity9 and @entity96 may not be the most trustworthy , so paying up wo n't necessarily guarantee a release			1
and it might end up putting others at risk , both by encouraging more kidnappings and funding those behind mass killings			0
as under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence @entity215 argued in 2012 , " @entity0 payments lead to future kidnappings , and future kidnappings lead to additional ransom payments			0
and it all builds the capacity of terrorist organizations to conduct attacks			0
" some say that countries with no - ransom policies can end up giving militant groups incentives to kidnap more people if they negotiate with them			2
this debate raged after the @entity228 's release of @entity230 sgt. @entity229 last year in exchange for five @entity228 figures then in @entity34 military custody at @entity234 , @entity235			0
president @entity236 said afterward , " i make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get a young man back to his parents			0
" in @entity7 's case , such a prisoner swap is n't an option			2
it 's not as if the country has a lot of suspected @entity9 members in its custody			0
so @entity62 's bargaining chips might consist more of doing something like not giving $ 200 million to those invested in the @entity61 fight -- a pledge that @entity171 said tuesday he 's not willing to rescind			1
@entity9 ' history shows there may not be a lot , but it 's possible that there will be talks with the @entity9 hostage takers			0
@entity7 can point to the fact that unlike the @entity34 and @entity194 , it 's not involved directly with the military effort in @entity263 or @entity35			0
@entity9 might surprise everyone by freeing the @entity7 pair as a goodwill gesture			1
but absent a last - ditch diplomatic effort , @entity7 may have to rely on military forces from allies in the @entity270 , the @entity271 or elsewhere to rescue its citizens			1
whatever the approach , time is clearly running out .			0

on a video , @entity9 demands $ 200 million to release two @entity7 citizens
the request is much higher than is *typically* requested or paid out for hostages
some nations have policies against paying ransom , saying it encourages kidnappers
