-- is the world of @entity2 ready for @entity3 : the sequel ? @entity6 teammates @entity5 and @entity8 's battle for the 2014 championship is drawing tantalizing comparisons with the sport 's most famous rivalry between former @entity14 pairing @entity13 and @entity15			1
the @entity6 duo fell out at last week 's @entity17 and will go wheel - to - wheel again at sunday 's @entity18 in @entity19 with the wounds still sore			1
but the @entity6 team is keeping a cool head with executive director @entity23 confident he can stop any drama between his drivers getting out of hand			1
" it is an intense relationship but this intensity is normal , " @entity23 told the @entity6 team website			2
" they are both competitive guys and they are fighting for a world championship			0
" there have been a lot of comparisons to the @entity13 / @entity3 scenario , which is a kind of compliment to both @entity5 and @entity8			1
" the racing philosophy of @entity6 is to allow our drivers to compete ; we let the boys play with their toys , unless they break them			2
" it can be pretty tense when they are racing so hard but the drivers know we will not tolerate any incident			0
" it 's a job , not a holiday and the drivers need to work with and for the team first of all			0
" @entity5 struggled to hide his frustration in @entity54 after @entity8 's error in qualifying prevented him from setting a quick time on his final lap. the @entity59 went on to win the race , where it is difficult to overtake , from pole position to retake the lead in the world championship			1
after the controversy , @entity5 suggested their teenage friendship was in danger of fracturing into @entity13 and @entity15 's acrimonious relationship			1
" i quite like the way @entity13 dealt with it so i 'm going to take a page out of his book , " the @entity72 2008 world champion told @entity74 radio			0
@entity13 and @entity15 dueled for the @entity6 world championship as @entity14 teammates in 1988 and 1989			1
@entity15 , nicknamed " @entity15 " for his cool , calculated approach accused his more passionate @entity83 teammate of forcing him off the road on more than one occasion			0
but despite their fierce rivalry , @entity15 and the late @entity13 respected each other as uniquely talented opposites who pushed each other to the limit to help them win seven world titles between them			1
ahead of the @entity94 @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity5 has moved to ease any angst with @entity8			2
he posted a photo of himself and @entity8 on his @entity98 page along with the message : " we 've been friends a long time and as friends we have our ups and downs			0
" today we spoke and we 're cool , still friends			0
" the 2008 world champion wrote tuesday : " we all stumble in life but it is how we get back up that defines us ! # ican # iwill # nevergiveup # @entity111			0
" @entity5 and @entity8 have been buddies since their teenage karting days and were often roommates on the junior racing circuit			2
but with the best car in @entity2 at their fingertips this season , the 2014 world title is a very real prospect for one of the @entity6 drivers , and that sort of prize can test even the most enduring friendships			1
@entity8 , who has never won a world title , leads 2008 winner @entity5 by four points in the drivers ' championship ahead of the seventh race of the season			1
" i now have the lead , which is great , " @entity8 told the @entity6 website			2
" but it 's still very early days and it 's going to continue to be an extremely tight battle between us this year			0
" the tighter the title chase , the looser their ties of friendship might just become .			0

@entity5 and @entity8 's fight for 2014 @entity6 title echoes @entity13 - @entity3 rivalry
@entity13 and @entity15 's title fights for @entity14 in 1988 and 1989 were famously fierce
*mercedes* say its policy is to let both drivers race -- but the team must come first
@entity5 says he and @entity8 are " still friends " after the pair fell out at @entity17
