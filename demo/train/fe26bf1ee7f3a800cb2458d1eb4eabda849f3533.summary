-- it 's friday afternoon and @entity2 is overwhelmed			1
several flights are delayed and passengers crowd the terminal , scowling at the departure screens and tapping away at their smartphones in frustration			2
it 's not a typical scene at @entity2 but hardly a surprising one			1
the airport was built 40 years ago to handle just 6 million passengers a year in a city that was then an island surrounded by the @entity14			1
@entity2 has since changed almost beyond recognition , becoming one of @entity18 's major capitals and a popular travel destination			1
@entity2 now handles 20 million passengers annually and should 've closed down long ago , but an embarrassing series of setbacks and delays to the city 's @entity25 new @entity21 ( @entity21 ) , have earned it a stay of execution			1
the new airport was originally due to open in 2012 , but there 's currently no scheduled launch date			1
surprisingly , rather than becoming increasingly frustrated with using @entity2 's creaking facilities , many locals are glad it 's still operating			1
" @entity2 has grown in @entity40 's hearts , " says @entity35 , a spokesman for the @entity36 , the body that will eventually have to sign @entity2 's death warrant			1
" as so often in life , people find it hard to part with what they 're used to			0
" proximity to the action @entity46 , flying to @entity48 after a conference in the @entity51 capital , is among those who have developed a deep affection for the airport			2
" i hope @entity2 stays for a long time , " she says			1
" it 's just so easy to reach and to go back and forth			2
" @entity46 's colleague , @entity57 , agrees			2
" i always find the check - in very quick , it 's super , " he says			1
" the new airport will never be ready anyway , so there 's is n't really a question of flying from somewhere else in the near future			2
" just a 20 - minute taxi ride from the city center , many travelers love @entity2 's proximity to the action			1
" it 's super convenient , " says @entity69 , a @entity2 - based cinematographer and @entity2 fan flying to @entity71 to film a commercial			1
" because of the round design , you can drop off at the gate and from there it 's 30 meters to check - in			2
and right behind the check - in , is security			0
" he also likes @entity2 's rather outdated but distinctive hexagonal style			1
" the great thing is the design of the airport , " he says			0
" it 's really marvelous , it 's really retro and it really fits @entity2			1
" other passengers are n't as enamored			0
on this particular friday , the simultaneous conclusion of several international conferences stretches @entity2 's already overstretched systems and there 's a backlog at check - in for the afternoon flight to @entity98			1
" up until this point i was quite impressed , but i 'm not impressed now , " says @entity99 , a @entity100 business traveler who 's been standing in line for some time			0
fellow @entity104 @entity103 , who travels through @entity2 two or three times a year on business , is also frustrated by the airport experience			1
" it 's normally terrible , because there 's no facilities , " he says			0
" you always have to queue			0
" the sooner the @entity51 sort out their new airport the better			0
it needs a decent airport , one that caters for passengers			2
" blown budgets @entity2 's small size does have advantages			1
two flustered passengers are allowed to check in with bags just half an hour ahead of takeoff			0
each gate has its own luggage belt , so even latecomers have the chance to make the plane			0
@entity2 's @entity36 says the new airport wo n't work in quite the same way , but it will have a modern and fast check - in system			1
today , though , the beautifully designed wooden check - in desks at @entity21 are empty , new equipment wrapped in plastic while technicians work through a series of glitches			1
" one of the main problems we still have is with fire - safety issues , " says the airport authority 's @entity35			1
this is n't the only headache for the airport 's developers			2
with construction ongoing since 2006 , costs are running at least double the original budget of â ‚ ¬ 2.8 billion ( $ 3.6 billion )			0
" the airport is different to the one which was originally planned			0
we 've grown over the years , " says @entity35			0
" it 's like when you plan a home for one family , but over time you realize you need a home for three families			0
but that 's no excuse for the mistakes which we made			0
" a lot was done wrong and a lot was planned badly			0
we have to correct that			0
" another issue is that air passenger traffic in @entity2 is growing faster than anticipated			2
@entity21 was originally planned for 27 millions passengers , but with the city 's two existing airports currently handling close this number , the concern is the new hub wo n't be able to cope			1
controversial closure for airlines the new airport ca n't come soon enough			0
@entity175 is currently housed in a temporary terminal at @entity2 that 's so makeshift it has a corrugated iron roof			1
it says it 's had to put growth plans on hold because of the delays			1
@entity2 has limited capacity for long - haul jets -- it 's runway is too short for the @entity186 super jumbo -- so airlines are unable to expand their route networks until @entity21 opens			1
@entity175 's @entity189 says the delay is affecting the entire @entity51 travel industry			0
" clearly , @entity2 needs a modern and fully operational airport , " he says			1
" we all need @entity21			2
we are looking forward to the day it will open			0
" global travel expert @entity195 says @entity2 is coping , largely because its old @entity198 division bequeathed it an airport on either side of the city : @entity2 and the east 's @entity202			1
" the one really regrettable thing is that @entity205 was closed -- the city center airport would be thriving today had it been allowed to continue , " he says			0
since its controversial closure , @entity210 -- famous for its role in the 1948 @entity2 airlift -- has been turned into a public park , its old runways crowded with cyclists and skaters and visitors filled with nostalgia for their most beloved inner city airport			1
berliners are equally interested in the new as the old , and while @entity21 might not be ready for takeoff yet , it 's already welcoming tourists			1
for â ‚ ¬ 10 , visitors can take a bus tour of the new facility and can even buy t - shirts and teddy bears with the airport logo			2
runway bus tours tour guide @entity230 says @entity21 has had more than a million visitors to date			1
" many people are from the area who know about this project , " says @entity230			0
" there 's been a lot of talk about the airport and we want other people to be able to join that conversation and to see what 's happened in the past few years			2
" visitors can speed down the new runway on the tour bus -- the closest they 'll get to flying from here until the airport actually opens			0
" we hope it is n't too much longer , " says @entity251 , a visitor from @entity2 , " because we stood in front of the check - in hall and it was really nice compared to the other airports we have here			1
" airport tourist @entity256 was pleased with what he saw , too			0
" i thought it would be a big construction site , but it actually looks ready , " he says			0
" it 's quite nice			0
it looks good inside , the wood , a lot of light , a lot of glass			0
i 'm not sure when i 'll be using it , but it will be good for @entity2			2
" any possible opening is still a long way off			0
authorities are reluctant to announce a date and face further embarrassment of yet again having to reschedule			2
so for now , those who enjoy flying out of @entity2 , can be assured it will be operating for some years to come			2
not such good news for those who find the travel experience at this small local airport frustrating			0
