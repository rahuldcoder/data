-- the prospect of a winter @entity2 in 2022 looks set to become a reality after @entity5 's football associations voted against holding the tournament in the @entity8 summer			1
all 54 member associations of @entity5 , @entity5 's governing body , backed the decision at the meeting in @entity12 thursday			1
" they all agreed that this competition could not take place in the heat of @entity8 in the summer , " @entity14 vice-president @entity13 told @entity0			1
" at the end of the day common sense has to prevail here and i 'm glad at long last common sense has prevailed , " he added			0
@entity14 , the game 's world governing body , has been considering the option of moving the tournament because of fears that players and fans would be adversely affected by the searing heat , which can reach 122 degrees @entity32 during the summer			1
@entity14 president @entity33 recently stated that it would not be feasible to hold a summer @entity2 in @entity8 and will make a decision on the timing of the tournament at the @entity39 meeting in @entity40 , @entity41 on october 3 and 4			1
a winter @entity2 would cause chaos with the @entity44 domestic season with clubs fearing they could lose out financially			0
" what has to happen now is that the people who are involved , including the people from @entity8 , they have to sit down and work out a situation that 's going to cause ( as ) minimum ( a ) disruption that can possibly be made to football , " said @entity13			0
" not only in @entity5 but throughout the world			2
" there are nine years to plan the @entity2 and surely with common sense this can be overcome			0
" @entity5 president @entity57 , who voted for @entity8 , believes a move to january or february would suit his members			1
" i was very happy to learn that @entity14 president @entity33 wants to move the @entity62 to the winter , something i 've long advocated , " the @entity60 told the media last month			1
@entity57 also rejected claims by the chief executive of the @entity67 , @entity66 , who claimed switching the @entity2 was " well nigh impossible , " citing disruption to the calendar and the impact on lucrative television deals			2
he added : " for 150 years , @entity72 has imposed its calendar and we 've respected it			0
" so for once , for one month , @entity72 could respect another calendar			0
" @entity14 's decision to award the @entity62 to @entity8 has led to huge criticism with @entity79 football chiefs threatening legal action			2
@entity81 , which lost out to @entity8 along with @entity82 , the @entity83 and @entity84 , believes it should be compensated if the @entity2 is held in the winter rather than the summer			1
earlier this week , the @entity81 laid out its case which it expects @entity14 's @entity39 to examine			1
" an in - principle decision that just and fair compensation should be paid to those nations that invested many millions , and national prestige , in bidding for a summer event , " it said			2
" if there is consensus within the @entity94 that a change in date should be considered , then a transparent process should be established to examine the scheduling implications for all leagues and a method developed for agreeing appropriate compensation for those affected			0
" that case is unlikely to succeed according to a @entity14 spokesperson , despite the pressure from the @entity79 fa			0
a @entity14 spokesperson told @entity0 : " as part of the bidding documents all bidders , including the @entity110 , accepted that the final decision regarding the format and dates of the staging of the @entity2 and @entity14 though initially expected to be in june / july , remains subject to the final decision of the @entity116			0
" there is no ground for any speculations			0

@entity5 backs plan to move @entity122 to winter
@entity14 will hold vote next month in @entity40 to decide on outcome
@entity5 president @entity57 has *suggested* a january or february time frame
@entity81 wants compensation for switch from winter to summer
