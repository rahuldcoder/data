@entity0 , @entity1 -- authorities on thursday ordered the closure of a restaurant for repeatedly violating the nation 's tough new anti-smoking law , the first such shutdown in @entity1 , officials told @entity2			1
the owner of the restaurant -- @entity12 near the popular southern @entity14 resort of @entity15 -- earlier this week defiantly told @entity1 media he would not pay a nearly $ 200,000 fine for allowing clients to smoke in his locale , despite the new law which prohibits smoking in all indoor bars and restaurants			1
" this restaurant has been in non-compliance since the law began , " said a spokesman for @entity1 's national health ministry			1
" from what we know , this is the first case in the country " of a restaurant closure order			0
health inspectors made two visits to the restaurant thursday , the first time leaving an order to close the establishment and the second time accompanied by two police officers , @entity2 affiliate @entity40 reported from the scene			0
but restaurant owner @entity42 dug in his heels , telling a throng of reporters outside the restaurant on thursday , " no one is going to close my business			2
i will fight ' til the end			0
i 'm using my constitutional rights as a citizen and i 'm not going to be run over by this dictatorial , @entity53 , terrorist government			0

even before the new smoking law took effect january 2 , the restaurant posted signs reading , " as a private business , making use of what we understand to be our rights , this law will not be applied in our establishment			0
" the signs went on to accuse @entity1 's @entity77 government of using the new law as a " smoke screen to cover up seven years of massive destruction in @entity1 , " apparent references to the country 's deep economic crisis and to the two terms of the elected government			1
the restaurant owner , @entity42 , has since formed an association called @entity87 or be ruined , trying to build support among other bar and restaurant owners for non-compliance with the law			1
the law puts @entity1 in line with the strictest @entity96 countries , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99 , which prohibit smoking in all enclosed public spaces			2
the @entity1 government says most of the nation 's bars and restaurants are complying with the ban			2

@entity42 told @entity40 in an interview earlier this week that he had no intention of paying the nearly $ 200,000 fine , and he vowed to fight any attempt to limit his decision to permit clients to smoke in his restaurant			1
