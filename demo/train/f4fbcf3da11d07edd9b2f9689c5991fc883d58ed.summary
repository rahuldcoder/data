@entity0 , @entity1 -- savoring a meal of vegetables and rice grown in nearby paddy fields washed down with some home - brewed rice wine served , it 's clear @entity10 is delighted to be back			1
once one of the 250 million @entity13 farmers that left behind their families to forge a living in the coastal factory towns , the 37 year old lives back in his ancestral village of @entity0 , a jumble of 200 timber houses that cling to the side of a valley in southeast @entity1 , one of @entity13 's poorest province			1
" i do n't want to leave anymore , " he says , tired of factory work and living in a cramped dormitory after four years spent making leather shoes in @entity31 in eastern @entity13			1
@entity32 is not alone in abandoning what has been described as the one of the greatest human migrations of all time			2
while the overall number of migrant workers is still on the rise in @entity13 , those seeking work in their home provinces increased at a quicker pace that the number of long - distance workers , according to analysis by @entity47			1
investment in @entity13 's inland provinces has meant that many migrant workers can now find decent paying jobs closer to home and many , like @entity32 , have concluded that separation from their families and communities is too great a price to pay			1
grand plans not just home to sample his wife 's cooking , @entity32 has a plan to give himself and his village a better future			1
he hopes to revive the traditional trade of silver and metal working that has all but died out as people left in search of better opportunities			1
" when i was growing up , all you could hear was the noise of hammering , " says @entity32 , who learned the trade from his father			1
these days the village is eerily quiet , with only a cock 's crow and the whinny of a pack pony , still used to navigate the steep valleys , puncturing the silence on a hot and sunny august afternoon			2
@entity32 has set up a basic workshop lit up with naked lightbulbs in the basement of his three - storey wooden house , where he , his wife and eldest son make jewelry by manipulating fine silver thread into butterflies , flowers and animal shapes			1
long history @entity93 of @entity94 , who has researched the village 's silver - making tradition , says its history can be traced back to the 16th century , although it 's unclear why the trade took root here			1
a bone - jarring three - hour drive on mountain roads from the nearest town , @entity105 , feels remote but in the @entity106 @entity93 says the village was a crossroads on major trade routes and , by the standards of the time , was prosperous			2
its decline began in the @entity114 and according to her research , in 2012 only 17 out of 192 households were still producing silverware			0
@entity93 , who is helping @entity32 and the other villagers revive their trade , is confident that silvermaking can become a viable business that will encourage villagers to return and pass on their craft to a new generation			1
she says that attitudes are shifting as @entity13 's slowing economy means job opportunities outside the village are not as alluring or lucrative as they once were			1
and the growth of tourism in the region 's picturesque towns and villages means that demand for jewelry made in @entity105 is picking up			0
" some people think that children should study hard , rather than learn a trade , but people are also beginning to realize that now even graduates ca n't find jobs , " she says			0
passionate advocate with his good looks and easy charm , @entity32 is a passionate advocate of his craft and has founded a silversmith association to promote and authenticate @entity105 silverwork			1
" wholesalers come to our village to buy our work but once it 's in the shop it becomes someone else 's brand			1
" " we do n't get the retail price and the difference is very big			0
we 'll sell them an item for 100 yuan ( us $ 16 ) and they will sell it for 400 yuan ( us $ 65 )			0
" @entity32 wants to sell to customers directly and use the village provenance as a marketing tool			2
he relies on word of mouth to sell his work but given the village has no paved road , there is little passing trade and the village remains off the tourist trail that is beginning to emerge in the valleys below			2
long considered opening an online shop on @entity179 , an online commerce site similar to @entity181 , but feared his work would be copied			0
" no - one knows about us			0
we hope to develop our own @entity105 brand name , " he says			0
new designs to reach a wider market , @entity32 has experimented with new designs			0
traditionally , the silversmiths in the village , home to members of the @entity189 ethnic group , made the elaborate head - dresses and hair pieces that are worn by women on festivals , weddings and other special occasions			0
using knowledge gleaned during his time outside the village , @entity32 turns traditional @entity189 symbols like butterflies , fish and drums into modern pendants , charm bracelets and anklets			2
" we have to follow the trends			0
it helps promote our skills as traditional craftsmen			0
" but it 's not a get rich quick strategy			0
his family is reliant on their land for food and a dry spell this summer means that some crops have failed			0
monthly profits from silver - smithing are less than a third of the 7,000 to 8,000 yuan ( us $ 1,200 ) he earned at the shoe factory			0
he also worries that tourists buying @entity189 silverware ca n't tell the difference between machine and handmade work and wo n't be prepared to spend the extra money on the handcrafted pieces he produces			0
nevertheless , he 's hopeful his efforts to revive his village 's time honored trade will pay off and allow his 15 - year - old son to avoid the factory towns and become the thirteenth generation of his family to work as a silversmith			1
" i do n't want to be the last , " @entity32 says .			2

@entity13 migrant workers like @entity10 are heading home
they are *attracted* by better economic opportunities inland
@entity32 wants to revive village 's ancient silversmith trade
does n't want son to work in factories
