gen. @entity1 will plead guilty to adultery and mistreating his accuser in a deal that will see the sexual assault and sodomy charges against him dropped , according to his defense team and @entity9 affiliate @entity8			1
maj. gen. @entity10 , a commander at @entity11 , @entity12 , where the court - martial has been taking place , approved @entity1 's offer to plea this weekend , making it a binding document , according to a statement from the defense			1
defense attorney @entity21 applauded the decision while attacking the @entity23 , which the defense has accused of interfering in the case , and @entity1 's accuser , an @entity27 captain the defense has painted as a jilted lover who was upset that the general would n't leave his wife			1
" after wasting millions of taxpayer dollars , the @entity27 finally admitted what it 's known for many months : general @entity1 is innocent of sexual assault			1
two successive prosecutors agreed that these charges should be dropped , as did two successive staff judge advocates , " @entity21 said in a statement			2
he continued , " the government understood that if it allowed @entity43 's accuser to be cross-examined , she would be caught in a thick web of her own lies			0
it should n't have taken two years for them to come to this conclusion , but they were driven by politics rather than justice			0
" @entity21 concluded his remarks , saying that the " reputational and financial costs " @entity1 has suffered because of " false rape allegations " should be factored into his sentencing			1
the testimony of the general 's accuser was never fully aired			0
she testified for several hours march 7 , telling the court that the affair started with intimate exchanges and evolved into groping and demands for sex and oral sex , @entity8 reported			0
she also said the general threatened to kill her and her family , the station reported			0
she was scheduled to continue her testimony march 10 , but col. @entity72 , the presiding judge in the court - martial , dismissed the jury after 22 pages of e-mails emerged that appear to point to alleged @entity23 interference in the case			0
at least one of the e-mails also seemed to indicate that a senior @entity27 official felt the accuser had a credibility issue			0
while @entity72 said there may have been " undue command influence " by @entity23 officials , he declined the defense team 's request that he drop charges against @entity1			1
@entity72 instead ordered that the general be provided a possible plea deal			0
@entity1 's attorneys filed a @entity95 request for all @entity23 e-mail communication including keywords in the @entity1 case , identifying about 10,000 e-mails among a dozen senior @entity23 officials , defense spokesman @entity92 said			1
the @entity23 was reviewing the communications and would likely release them slowly , @entity92 said wednesday , but if the two sides reached a plea deal and something pivotal arose in those e-mails , the defense would file another motion to dismiss charges			2
@entity92 said last week that @entity1 would not plead guilty to sexual assault , threatening the accuser or her family or any charge that would land him on a sex - offender registry			1
the sunday statement from the defense team said the plea deal nixed all three charges that would necessitate sex offender status for the general , as well as a charge of defrauding the government and a charge that alleged " @entity1 ' coerced and compelled ' his accuser to remain in their three - year , consensual relationship			1
" the 27 - year @entity27 veteran will instead agree that his failure to end the relationship resulted in his accuser 's emotional discomfort and distress , as did his refusal to divorce his wife and marry his accuser , the defense statement said			2
the general will also plead guilty to mistreating his accuser , which the defense team noted is " an infraction unique to the @entity139			1
" " we 're left with a collection of lesser charges , most of which are n't criminal in the civilian world , " @entity21 said in his statement			2
" @entity1 has admitted to mistakes that are normally a matter between husbands and wives , or employees and @entity153 departments			0
it 's time to put this matter to rest			0
" @entity156 will begin this week			0
while it 's unclear what penalty @entity1 faces , the government has agreed to a " quantum " -- essentially a maximum - penalty cap that wo n't be revealed to @entity162 , according to the defense			1
@entity72 will hand down his sentence , and @entity1 will face the lesser of the two sentences -- either @entity166 's or those laid out in the quantum			2
