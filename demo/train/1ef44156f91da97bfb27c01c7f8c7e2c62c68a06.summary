a successful mission by @entity3 's @entity2 orbiter would make the country the first @entity5 nation to reach the @entity2 -- and provide a symbolic coup as neighboring @entity8 steps up its ambitions in space			1
tuesday 's launch was successful , but the plan to send the @entity13 , or " @entity2 craft , " on a 680 million - kilometer journey into @entity2 ' orbit has given further credence to claims of an intensifying -- although officially unacknowledged -- space race developing in @entity5 , with potentially dangerous ramifications			1
" i believe @entity3 's leadership sees @entity8 's recent accomplishments in space science as a threat to its status in @entity5 , and feels the need to respond , " says dr @entity22 , professor at the @entity23 , who sees increasing competition for space - related power and prestige in @entity5 that echoes the @entity28 space race of the mid- 20th century			1
while @entity42 , the head of @entity3 's @entity43 , has stressed his country is not engaged in competition with any other nation , the mission -- to put a probe into an elliptical orbit around the red planet , mapping its surface and studying the atmosphere -- has been freighted with patriotic significance since its inception			1
prime minister @entity48 announced the 4.5 billion rupee ( us $ 74 million ) mission on @entity3 's @entity50 last year , just months after a failed joint mission to @entity2 by @entity52 and @entity8 -- @entity3 's great regional rival for superpower status and the most rapidly accelerating space power			1
to date , only the @entity56 , @entity57 and the @entity58 have successfully sent spacecraft to @entity2 -- @entity62 's 1998 @entity61 orbiter was also unsuccessful			2
but not everyone will be cheering from the sidelines			0
economist dr @entity65 of the @entity66 questions the wisdom of investing resources in a flag - waving trip to @entity2 when the country faces such pressing development needs at home			2
" much as i admire @entity3 's @entity2 mission as a scientific achievement , i am unable to understand the urgency of getting there , " he told @entity73			1
" the country would be better served if the same resources , talent and zeal were focused on public health or solar energy			0
this is a prime case of trying to climb the ladder from the top			0
" interactive : human exploration of the @entity2 -- from @entity88 to @entity89 even a former head of @entity91 , dr. @entity90 , has criticized the project as a waste of resources , saying the proposal was half - baked , too expensive and poorly conceived			2
he told @entity73 's sister network @entity96 that while he was in favor of exploring @entity2 , " my contention is that it has to be done properly with complete set of instruments and with proper orbit			2
" the elliptical orbit , which he said would bring the craft within 360km of @entity2 at its closest point and 80,000km at its furthest , was " the wrong kind of orbit to enable any clear observation of a planet			2
" " it is not value for money , that 's what i feel , " he told @entity96			0
" with regard to priorities , we know there is severe shortage of communication transponders in the country			0
we need to prioritize that			0
" so why is @entity3 aiming for @entity2 ? for much of its 50 - year history , @entity3 's space program has prioritized developing technological capacity to help its population , such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites			1
just last month , points out dr @entity135 , fellow at the @entity136 , @entity3 's satellite network -- one of the largest communications systems in the world -- successfully gave advance warning of a cyclone heading for the eastern seaboard , allowing for the evacuation of about 900,000 people			1
but since 2008 , when @entity3 sent an unmanned probe to the @entity144 , the focus has shifted away from a utilitarian focus towards exploration			2
@entity42 , @entity91 chairman , told @entity73 the mission had several aims , including monitoring the planet for traces of life that may have existed on @entity2 , but predominantly to demonstrate the technological capability for interplanetary travel			2
" first and foremost , what we are trying to do is reach there , " he said			0
@entity135 said the mission was " primarily about technology proving , " and was also a matter of significant national prestige			0
" it ca n't be said that it is a scientific issue , " he said			0
indeed , any scientific gains from the mission were unlikely to prove " earth - shattering , " said professor @entity166 of the @entity167 , chairman of the @entity168 for @entity43 and @entity169			0
" it would be a modest scientific gain that 's attempted in the first instance , to demonstrate the capability			0
" rather , the mission was driven mainly by the desire " to demonstrate they can " -- a projection of @entity3 's technological expertise intended to boost its international prestige and credentials as a leading world power			1
" it is a way of showing that you should be taken seriously : ' we are growing in status as a major spacefaring nation , which tends to go alongside growing in status as a great nation			0

since @entity8 launched its first manned spacecraft into orbit a decade ago , he believes , @entity5 has become the epicenter of a new space race , with @entity8 , @entity62 , and then @entity3 leading the way , and smaller powers such as @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 beginning to follow suit with ambitions of their own			1
this increasing competitiveness , @entity22 argues , is fueling regional tensions , and carries with it the risk for potential confrontations and a deepening militarization of space , unless it is accompanied by greater cooperation			1
conceived in the current regional environment , he said , @entity3 's @entity2 mission was " clearly linked to politics and prestige as much as science			1
" in terms of national security , he said , " @entity3 faces a serious challenge from @entity8 's rising space capabilities			1
" " it can not compete with @entity8 's vast resources head to head , as it would likely lose any space ' arms race ' with @entity235 , " he said , adding that meant @entity3 would have to be " creative in crafting its response to @entity8 developments " including potentially forming alliances with other spacefaring powers			1

@entity166 said that while there had been a rapid acceleration of space activities in the region , " i 'd hesitate to call it a space race			1
" rather than being fueled by competition , he said , the heightened activity was largely due to an increasing appreciation of the importance to states of space assets and satellite technology			2
they provided vital functions in areas such as communications , or remote sensing for climate change monitoring , disaster management or resources prospecting			0
" there 's a growing realization if you 're engaged in space , if you have access to space assets and space - based information , then you stand to gain economically , and in terms of prestige as a nation , " he said			0
the extent to which countries were motivated by pragmatic interest or prestige varied from nation to nation			0
" for a country like @entity279 , the space aspirations are extremely pragmatically driven			0
on the other hand , a country like @entity201 is intent on putting astronauts in space -- that 's very prestige - oriented			0
" @entity135 also disputed that a space race was occurring , saying his country acknowledged its limitations in being able to compete with superior space powers and was content to play to its technological strengths , including through comparatively low - cost missions like @entity13			1
" a space race ? this is not the right way to look at it			1
if you look at the technological base of @entity62 , we are not comparable			0
in many ways , @entity8 has done better than @entity3 , we have no issues with that , " he said			2
" we are trying to collaborate , in my opinion			0

@entity3 's focus on @entity2 is a *product* of an increasing @entity5 space race , says an expert
dr @entity22 says there has been increased competition in region in past decade
he says @entity8 's rapid ascent as a space power has made neighbors follow suit
the mission has been criticized by some as *misguided* , given @entity3 's *social* needs
