@entity3 , @entity4 -- " @entity2 " is a superyacht with added wow - factor			1
her startling appearance has made sure of that and in real life she is every bit as dramatic as she appears in these photographs			2
" @entity2 " is the second time @entity12 has designed a superyacht			1
we were among the guests invited to the superyacht 's official launching in @entity18 , in northern @entity19 , when her celebrity designer and his team walked down the red carpet to cast his eyes upon his latest masterpiece			2
@entity12 of @entity26 is no stranger to eye - catching and dramatic design			1
his architectural firm @entity28 is responsible for iconic @entity3 landmarks such as 30 @entity30 , better known as the @entity31 , and the @entity32			2
@entity12 is the master of the curved line			1
imagine for a moment a photograph of the @entity31 split in two lengthwise and laid flat , recall the sweeping curves of the @entity32 and you will see how he has managed to combine the drama of those two creations into what is arguably the most visually stunning superyacht of the year			2
@entity2 is not the first of @entity12 's forays into the world of superyacht design			1
it was he who drew the lines for the @entity49 - built @entity48 , a 58 - metre yacht now called @entity51 and owned by @entity52			2
launched in 1993 , she is also a head - turner			2
design and external appearance aside , @entity2 is different from every other 41 - metre superyacht in that she is not to be the sole property of any one owner			1
this perhaps is one of the reasons for her radical look as she is designed to appeal to those who are new to the concept of superyacht ownership			1
unlike the traditional form of ownership , where one person , sometimes through an anonymous corporation , is the owner of all 64 shares of the yacht , the shares in @entity67 are split either into eight or sixteen parts			0
these fractions -- one - eighth or one - sixteenth -- of @entity67 have been sold to different individuals by the @entity3 - based company @entity77			0
when engaged to design the yacht , the @entity12 team were initially told to work within the confines of an existing hull designed by yacht builders @entity82 , part of @entity84			1
but after discussions , @entity84 has produced a new 41 - metre hull three metres longer than the original concept			0
walking around @entity67 , it is clear that @entity12 has taken all the traditional rules of yacht design , torn them up and started again			1
the public rooms benefit from abundant natural light , which floods in through the floor - to - ceiling windows , in addition to the copious artificial lights			0
coupled with the use of pale - coloured woods , soft furnishings and white high - gloss , wipe - clean surfaces they create a wonderfully bright , modern feel			0
unusually for a motor yacht , the natural teak decking extends right the way through from the aft deck to the saloon , ensuring a seamless visual transition between the outside and inside spaces			0
to join the @entity111 will cost an initial payment of € 1.875 million			1
this buys you a one eighth share of the yacht and guarantees 30 nights per year on board -- ten nights peak season in the @entity121 , ten nights peak season in the @entity123 , and two five - night cultural tours such as sightseeing , shopping , golf , @entity128 , vineyard visits and museums			0
each year there will be an annual service charge of € 200,000 to cover overheads , including marine and hotel operations , permanent crew , mooring and berthing fees , year - round maintenance and mechanical upkeep , marine and port charges and cruise itineraries management			0
@entity12 said : " with my team we have given a new emphasis to such issues as quality and quantity of space , outdoor terraces , light and views			1
our commission is for the total design concept of the fleet , with an eye on beauty , function and luxury , down to the smallest detail			0
we believe that there is great potential in the concept of luxury cruisers to think afresh such issues as views , light , privacy and the quality of spaces -- both inside and outdoors			0
" the concept of fractional ownership is fast becoming acknowledged as a logical way forward for those wishing to enjoy high - end luxury products without the massive capital investement required			0
@entity12 himself owns one of the shares and is very much looking forward to experiencing what it is like to step into the shoes of a superyacht owner			1
it may only be for a fraction of the time but it is also , as he so eloquently puts it , only for a fraction of the price			0
