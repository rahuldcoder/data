-- march 11 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity14 , @entity15 : fridays are always awesome here on @entity0			1
and we thank you for spending part of your friday with us			1
i 'm @entity23 , sitting in today for @entity24			1
first up : congressional hearings @entity26 : first up , we 're talking about hearings on @entity29 that caused controversy even before they started			1
the @entity32 is holding these hearings to look into the radicalization of @entity35			1
basically , the idea that a group like @entity38 could recruit @entity40 muslims and turn them into terrorists			1
some critics called the hearings an unfair attack on loyal @entity40			1
but representative @entity45 , who 's the chairman of the committee , says that the goal is not to condemn @entity48 as a religion or @entity40 muslims as a group			2
but he says the hearings are designed to limit the threat of terrorism			1
and he also believes they 're important to @entity40 's safety			2
@entity57 @entity45 , ( r ) @entity58 : let me make it clear today , that i remain convinced that these hearings must go forward and they will			1
to back down would be a craven surrender to political correctness and an abdication of what i believe to be the main responsibility of this committee : to protect @entity40 from a terrorist attack			2
@entity26 : one of the people who testified during yesterday 's hearings was representative @entity71 , the first muslim elected to the @entity72			1
he acknowledged that some @entity50 are responsible for violent actions			2
but he said you ca n't blame an entire community for the evil of some individuals			2
he got especially emotional talking about a @entity50 paramedic and police cadet who died trying to help others during the 9/11 terrorist attacks			2
rep. @entity71 , ( @entity83 ) @entity84 : @entity85 was a fellow @entity40 who gave his life for other @entity40			2
his life should not be identified as just as a member of an ethnic group or just a member of a religion , but as an @entity40 who gave everything for his fellow @entity40			2
@entity93 @entity26 : bullying has been a big topic in the news recently			1
and yesterday , president @entity97 and first lady @entity98 hosted the first ever @entity99 on @entity93			1
parents and students got together to talk about the effects of bullying and how to stop it in school and online			1
@entity107 , our senior @entity99 correspondent , has more on that event			1
( begin video ) @entity107 , @entity112 @entity111 : president @entity97 using this first - ever @entity99 anti-bullying summit as a forum to try to bring attention to this very , very difficult issue and say , look , for too long there have been students all around the country who have just accepted it , that they were going to get picked on , that they were going to be bullied , be the subject of assaults and violence and that it was sort of a rite of passage for kids			1
the president says that given all these tragic incidents where some kids have committed suicide over bullying , he says it 's time for all of this to end , for schools to have higher standards			1
and he and the first lady have used various social media tools like @entity141 to bring that message directly to students , to report some of these bullying incidents , for example			1
the president used his forum at the @entity99 to say that even he as a kid was bullied			1
@entity40 president @entity97 : as adults , we all remember what it was like to see kids picked on in the hallways or in the schoolyard			1
and i have to say , with big ears and the name that i have , i was n't immune			2
i did n't emerge unscathed			2
but because it 's something that happens a lot , and it 's something that 's always been around , sometimes we 've turned a blind eye to the problem			2
we 've said , " kids will be kids			2
" and so , sometimes we overlook the real damage that bullying can do , especially when young people face harassment day after day , week after week			1
@entity168 : so the bottom line is , the key moving forward is going to be , will there actually be some action to back up some of the talk at this summit			2
@entity107 , @entity0 , the @entity99			1
( @entity175 ) @entity176 @entity26 : the showdown in @entity5 may be over			2
this started with @entity182 governor @entity181 's budget proposal that would limit negotiating rights for workers ' unions			1
fourteen @entity187 state senators fled the state so that there would n't be enough people there to pass the bill			2
on wednesday , @entity182 took out all the parts of the bill that had to do with the budget			2
voting on non-budget bills requires less people , so the reduced negotiating rights passed			2
protesters at the capitol yesterday started pounding on the windows			1
that forced police to put the building in lockdown ! they closed the capitol and forcibly removed anyone inside who would n't leave			2
one entrance was re-opened later in the day			0
@entity210 @entity211 , @entity15 : today 's first @entity212 goes out to mr. @entity214 's social studies classes at @entity215 in @entity216 , @entity217 ! what is the smallest type of bird ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it the : a ) @entity228 , b ) @entity226 or @entity83 ) @entity229 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! hummingbirds are the smallest ; even the largest variety is only about 8 inches long			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! " @entity229 " drones @entity26 : imagine if the military had a vehicle that was as small as a hummingbird			1
definitely would n't be able to fit a pilot in there			0
but that 's actually the point			0
we 're talking about drones , aircraft that someone flies by remote control			0
the @entity40 military has used drones for years			0
@entity251 is going to show us one right now that could bring big changes to the battlefield			0
( begin video ) @entity256 , @entity0 pentagon correspondent : imagine a drone as small as a hummingbird ; same shape , same sound			1
wait , do n't imagine			0
it 's here in this @entity263 lab. @entity264 , @entity266 project manager : it looks more or less like an indigenous small bird , and it can fly through small clearings and through trees and seeing inside			0
@entity271 : @entity266 's @entity272 says this is how the bird sees us from above			0
right now , the hummingbird can only fly a little bit longer than 10 minutes			1
but at that size , imagine what it could do in 10 hours			1
the @entity279 has spent $ 4 million with that dream in mind : @entity40 troops armed with an unmanned vehicle that blends into the other birds or insects in a given country			0
@entity287 : the operator hovers the aircraft around until it finds an opening			0
@entity271 : perhaps even buzz into a room , drop a payload and leave			0
but most unmanned vehicles , the hummingbird included , still depend on man to control their cameras or movements			1
@entity300 @entity299 , @entity40 @entity301 ( @entity302 ) : but that 's a vulnerability			0
@entity271 : retired general @entity306 says future enemies will cut the operator 's connection unless drones become more autonomous			0
he says sure , drones have worked in @entity312 and @entity313 , because there 's very few missiles to shoot them down			0
@entity316 : but if you fly these same vehicles where there is an air defense , those @entity321 and @entity322 would be falling from the sky like rain			0
@entity271 : compared to other drones , the hummingbird has a six - inch wing span and weighs less than a aa battery			1
but the designer needs to add intelligence to its small size			1
@entity287 : it could be much more useful if the aircraft could keep itself safe			0
@entity271 : if so , the military has designs beyond battle			0
it envisions the bird helping to find victims , weaving through crevices created by an earthquake			1
( @entity175 ) shoutout @entity342 @entity343 , @entity15 : time for a @entity344 ! under which president did the start of @entity346 in the @entity40 move from april to march ? you know what to do ! was it : a ) @entity351 , b ) @entity352 , @entity354 ) @entity355 or @entity83 ) @entity356 ? rewind the clock to three seconds -- and go ! the shift happened in 2007 under president @entity351			1
that 's your answer and that 's your @entity344 ! wakeup calls @entity26 : that @entity346 shift comes this weekend			0
you might be losing an hour of sleep			0
but if you think that gives you an excuse to be late to school on monday , school officials in @entity6 , @entity7 are ready to give you a wake - up call ! some of the city 's students who are late to class on a regular basis will hear the phone ring at 6:15 a.m. might be your principal , might be a celebrity			1
but the message is simple : get up and get to school ! the district says the goal is to keep students from falling too far behind			0
some parents are okay with the wake - up calls			0
but others say the schools are overstepping their bounds			0
@entity389 @entity26 : so , whose responsibility is it ? that 's what we 're asking on our blog			0
when it comes to making sure you 're on time for school , is it on you , your parents , your teachers and principals ? share your opinions on our blog at @entity405 ! before we go @entity26 : and finally , if leg of lamb sounds good to you , you 're gon na love today 's before we go segment			0
' cause we have 20 ! five baby lambs , born on a farm in @entity410			0
the owner says it 's pretty rare			0
@entity413 usually give birth to single lambs , maybe twins or even triplets			0
in fact , these little guys ' mom has had triplets twice before			0
but quintuplets do n't come along too often			0
we were hoping to get a reaction from the mama sheep , but she did n't seem too talkative			0
goodbye @entity26 : i guess she was just being sheepish			0
hopefully , this is n't a hoax , because we 'd hate for someone to pull the wool over our eyes			0
ewe had to know that one was coming			0
remember to set your clocks ahead this weekend			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity23 .			1
