-- @entity2 driver @entity1 has penned a new deal with @entity4 , extending his contract with the team to the end of the 2013 season			1
the @entity9 won his second race of the season at sunday 's rain - soaked @entity13 @entity12 , closing the gap in the drivers ' championship between himself and first - placed @entity17 to 13 points			1
" i 've been with @entity4 since 2007 and have achieved nine grand prix wins during that time , " @entity1 told the team 's official website			1
" i 'm high on confidence at the moment and firing on all cylinders			0
i know the team well and i 'm very comfortable here ; we have grown together over the years and it feels like absolutely the right thing to stay with @entity4 for another season			2
" tire talk : @entity31 takes center stage in @entity2 team principal @entity33 said of the announcement : " much of @entity1 's @entity2 success has been during his time with @entity4 and together we have achieved 10 poles , nine wins and 31 podiums			1
" as there was a strong desire from both sides to continue the partnership , it was a logical decision to extend our relationship and it is with great pleasure that we confirm @entity1 will drive for us in 2013			2
" much was made of a possible move to @entity51 rivals @entity50 at the end of the current season , but @entity1 has dismissed the speculation , stating : " there were discussions with @entity50 , but my decision was to stay here			1
" with the combined efforts of @entity1 and double world champion @entity59 , @entity4 currently hold an imperious lead at the top of the constructors ' championship , 64 points ahead of @entity50 , who have failed to finish top since 2008			1
the relationship between the two @entity4 drivers has often been perceived as less than amicable , with tempers flaring when they crashed into each other during the @entity71 in 2010			0
but @entity1 was quick to dispel any notion of hostilities			2
on his partnership with the @entity75 , @entity1 said : " obviously with @entity77 , we 've worked very , very close together for a long period of time now			2
i think no - one would really have envisaged how long we have worked together , so that 's probably been a bit of a surprise			0
" there are not many teammates staying together for that long in @entity2 , but it 's proved to be a successful partnership with both of us working very hard with the key technical members of the team			0
" it 's been a potent operation			0
we 're still competitive when we hit the track			0
last year there was n't much racing between @entity59 and @entity93 , but in 2009 , 2010 and this year , there have been some great battles			0
" when asked about his future beyond the 2013 season , @entity1 remained enigmatic			1
" it 's a results - based sport at the front of the grid so the future lies in my own hands , " said the 35 - year - old			1
" it 's down to me to deliver the on - track results			0
