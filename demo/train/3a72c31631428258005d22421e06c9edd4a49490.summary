-- first lady @entity1 was expected to make headlines in @entity3 with her style and flair as she accompanied her husband to the @entity7 , but it was a simple gesture that has set off a media frenzy			1
@entity11 's @entity10 and first lady @entity1 embrace while meeting wednesday in @entity12			1
while meeting @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity12 on wednesday , the two women briefly embraced -- not your typical scene at @entity16			1
the @entity11 media called it everything from a breach of protocol to an extraordinary show of affection from the queen			1
the @entity25 proclaimed it a " touching moment , " and the palace apparently agreed			0
" this was a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation between the queen and @entity1 , " a palace spokeswoman said			1
@entity0 's @entity34 talked about the moment thursday with @entity36 , author of " @entity37 , " on @entity0 's " @entity38			2
" @entity0 : according to our tabloids in the @entity42 , the meeting went really well			0
what 's your take ? @entity36 : absolutely			2
what is astounding is the picture of the queen with her arm around @entity1 and @entity1 's hand around the queen , too			1
but the queen made the first move			1
this is the most astounding thing because the queen is not known for being touchy - feely			1
indeed , her son @entity56 complained on one occasion that he was n't given enough affection when he was a child			2
she 's obviously a late developer			0
@entity0 : what 's the big deal [ about touching the queen ] ? @entity36 : the big deal is that the queen is normally a sacred person			2
in monarchies , there 's a sacredness that surrounds the sovereign , which is perhaps not known in republics , at least not all the time in the way that it is in a monarchy			0
she 's been on the throne a very , very long time , and she is herself a very dignified person , all the more so because of her relatively short stature			0
watch to see if " hugging " the queen broke protocol Â» one of the things one saw yesterday was the way [ president ] @entity1 and @entity77 towered over the queen and indeed prince @entity79			1
@entity0 : by the queen putting her hand on the small of @entity1 's back , does that signal friendship ? the queen said something to @entity1 toward the end of the meeting about keeping in touch			1
@entity36 : certainly , keeping in touch is meant quite literally			0
yes , it 's a very significant gesture ; she 's not known for this kind of thing			0
@entity95 : your thoughts on @entity1 and the queen @entity0 : let 's talk about the other gesture : the gift of the @entity102			1
some tabloids are calling it the " @entity109 " in the sense that this was n't a great present to give the queen			2
what do you think ? @entity36 : not a bad one at all			0
the queen is actually quite technologically advanced			0
she uses e-mail to a much greater extent than most members of the royal family and particularly much more than her son , who is a bit of a technophobe			0
@entity0 : [ the queen gave the president a silver - framed photograph of herself and her husband			2
] was it a recent picture of the queen and prince @entity79 at least ? @entity36 : that i do n't know			0
if it 's the same as she gives everybody , it must be a sort of middle period picture because it would have to cover so many years			0
on the other hand , it may well be that this gesture of terrific friendship and affection for @entity1 was her way of saying , " sorry , i should have given you something more personal			1

first lady @entity1 and @entity11 's @entity10 briefly embrace
