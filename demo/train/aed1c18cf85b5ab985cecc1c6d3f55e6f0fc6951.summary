@entity0 is @entity1 with @entity2 , a non-profit @entity3 think tank , based in @entity4 dc. he is currently at sea			2
@entity6 , @entity7 what happens when you mix 11 budding startups with @entity12 executives , @entity14 professors , a @entity15 and 600 college students and put them on a ship to circumnavigate the world ? an experiment launched this month called @entity20 hopes that this eclectic group will unleash global entrepreneurship			1
a 590 - foot ocean liner has become the incubator for this experiment , attracting aboard both multinational companies and international foundations , venture capitalists and environmental philanthropists , even a @entity30 prince and the founder of @entity32			1
all want to take part in fostering the entrepreneurial efforts of those on the ship			2
from @entity7 , the program will visit a range of developed markets from @entity41 to @entity42 as well as developing markets from @entity44 ( also known as @entity44 ) to @entity45			1
this allows for a crucial opportunity to not just tweak business models but more importantly test products in local contexts			1
for many of the founders , who come from countries around the world , this is their first voyage on a ship			1
as such , seasickness on the choppy waters of the @entity59 has been a recurring struggle , but it has not deterred the entrepreneurs from diving head first into the business workshops , one - on - one meetings and pitch events			1
the program is spearheaded by @entity14 's @entity67 and the @entity68 , which has teamed up with @entity69 to embark on a 105 - day journey to 13 countries around the world			1
it also has financial support from backers including @entity76 and @entity77			0
at its core , the program believes in creating a melting pot of individuals with different backgrounds , experiences and perspectives while also maintaining a context of openness that does n't shy away from experimentation and failure			1
and it 's no surprise to hear lunch conversations focused on intellectual property challenges in @entity92 and supply chain strategies for @entity94			0
when i boarded the ship , the co-founder of the program , @entity99 , explained to me the unique criteria he sought for the chosen entrepreneurs			1
" we are not looking for typical @entity104 startups , " he said			0
" we are hedging our bets on the black swans : startups who are leveraging technology to solve seemingly intractable social and environment challenges and who are positioned within billion dollar market opportunities			0
we hand selected these ventures from nearly 1,000 applications coming from just shy of 100 countries			1
" the handful of participating startups could be from a technocrat 's dream with products ranging from a tablet teacher training software to a solar - powered cooking stove			1
they are also geographically diverse with founders joining from @entity92 , @entity126 , @entity42 , @entity127 , and @entity128 , among other destinations			0
@entity130 , the co-founder of @entity14 's d.school , also leads the seaboard program			1
he told me : " we find ourselves at a time in which we 're shifting from a most industrialized era to a new era			0
and almost all of the institutions that were built on that last model that got us this far are n't really adapted for carrying us much farther			0
" after an orientation session on the deck , i spoke with @entity143 , founder and ceo of @entity145 , one of the more developed companies participating in the program			2
his idea began when he noticed that his friends in his @entity127 home state of @entity151 did n't have access to internet , but they all had mobile phones			0
so in 2009 , @entity143 and three classmates dropped out of college to focus on bridging this information gap through the development of a text message - based search engine			2
currently , the company has 120 million users and receives five million text message queries a day			2
and he says this is only the beginning			0
" there are a lot of dumb phones in the world , and what i want is to make every dumb phone smart with information			0
maybe because of this chance to visit 14 countries , we can see whether we can launch at scale			2
" in the end , @entity20 is moving into uncharted waters , and to a large degree , nobody on the ship knows exactly what the end result of this bold experiment will be			0
but despite this ambiguity , there is sense that this social alchemy might very well lead to innovation .			0
