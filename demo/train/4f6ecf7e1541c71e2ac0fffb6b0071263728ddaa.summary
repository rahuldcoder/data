it was n't the screech of cannonballs , the thud of grappling hooks or the crack of muskets that most terrified the sailors of the @entity8 in the 16th century , but fire			0
the @entity11 vice-admiral sir @entity12 used fire ships -- aging hulks set ablaze and allowed to float freely into the @entity8 -- to devastating effect , forcing the @entity17 ships to break formation			0
more than 400 years later , however , and fire is still one of the gravest threats to shipboard life			2
old threat , new technology shipboard procedures such as fire drills , on - board alarms and locking fire doors may have gone a long way to mitigating the danger of fire at sea , but the @entity33 is looking at new technology to help it battle the threat			1
its latest solution is to send fire - resistant metal men into the smoky , red - hot holds of its fire - stricken warships , throwing fire retarding grenades and assessing damage with a camera that can see through smoke			1
called the @entity47 ( @entity48 ) , the team at the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) chose a humanoid - type robot as the best way of negotiating the narrow passageways , ladders and hatches ( all designed for human mobility ) of a modern ship			1
" every compartment and passageway on a ship is designed for human occupation and mobility , " dr @entity56 , @entity46 program manager for human - robot interaction and cognitive neuroscience , told @entity0			2
" there are numerous barriers , like sills , that would block a wheeled robot			0
in addition , a humanoid robot can use firefighting gear designed for humans , such as protective coats , backpack fire suppressants , hand - held sensors and hose nozzles , " he said " the long - term goal is to keep sailors from the danger of direct exposure to fire			1
" shipboard fires , he said , throw up a different and more urgent set of problems than fires on land			1
" shipboard fires must be suppressed , whereas in many civilian fires , a building can be considered a loss and the focus might shift to containing the fire to prevent spread , " he told @entity0			1
" on a ship , fire suppression is critical to the survival of the ship and its personnel ; confined spaces , smoke , heat and gases can be a threat to humans			0
" developed by researchers at @entity108 and sponsored by the @entity46 , the @entity48 prototype was tested aboard the decommissioned warship @entity110 last year and unveiled at the @entity111 this month			1
super-human range @entity48 stands 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 143 pounds			2
the unique mechanism design on the robot equips it with super-human range of motion to maneuver in complex spaces			2
the team equipped the robot with a suite of sensors that include a camera , a gas sensor and a stereo infrared camera that will allow it to find its way through the choking black smoke that would deter human firefighters			0
its upper body has been designed to manipulate fire suppressing equipment and even to throw propelled extinguishing agent ( @entity133 ) grenades			1
the robot , say developers , can handle a fire hose on its own			2
with enough battery power for 30 minutes of firefighting , @entity48 is capable of walking in all directions , balancing in rough seas , and stepping around obstacles			2
" balancing on any type of terrain that 's unstable - especially for bipedal robots - is very difficult , " said @entity142 , associate professor for mechanical engineering at @entity108 " whole - body momentum control allows for the robot to optimize the locations of all of its joints so that it maintains its center of mass on uncertain and unstable surfaces			0
" robot a team player while the next generation of the robot will be designed with enhanced intelligence , communications capabilities and extended battery life , @entity142 said the robot would likely always take its orders from a human in a console			0
despite this , the algorithms that are being developed would allow mobility and decision making by the robot as a team member			0
" the robot has the ability to do autonomous tasks , but we have a human in the loop to allow an operator to intervene in any type of task that the robot 's doing , " he said			0
" we 're working toward human - robot teams			0
it 's what we call the hybrid force : humans and robots working together			0
" @entity186 said that ultimately , @entity48 could be used for a number of shipboard duties that are difficult or onerous for humans to perform			1
" for instance , a bipedal robot could be configured to take shipboard measurements , scan for corrosion and leaks , and identify changes to the shape of the room from its original configuration , " he said			1
" by taking on these time - consuming tasks , @entity48 could free up sailors for jobs that more fully take advantage of their training and technical skillsets			1

researchers have developed a robot that could help the @entity33 battle shipboard fires
the robot has been designed in a humanoid shape to negotiate complex *environments*
not only would the robot , called @entity48 , throw fire retarding grenades but *glean* *information*
researchers hope the robot will one *day* help with other difficult and onerous *onboard* tasks
