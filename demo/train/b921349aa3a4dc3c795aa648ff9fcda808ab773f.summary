-- for most comics , filling three - fourths of the @entity1 in @entity2 , large - @entity3 , is an accomplishment worth celebrating ... alone , of course , in a guest room at the @entity8 with a bottle of gin			1
not the case for @entity12			1
in fact , as one of the top - earning comics in the business , @entity12 enjoys worldwide popularity that 's hard to match , selling out arenas ( yes , arenas ) from @entity19 to @entity20 and everywhere in between			1
focusing on race and class , @entity12 draws from being @entity23 and @entity19 , and he believes audiences around the globe like him because he 's an outsider			1
" it 's like i 'm reporting live from a party i should n't be at , " he says			2
" there 's the cool kids , and then there 's the nerdy guy who snuck in wearing a hat			2
i 'm the nerdy kid who 's wearing the hat			2
" what makes @entity12 ' success even more amazing is that , aside from the occasional stand - up comedy special , you probably have n't seen him on tv or in movies			1
sure , he 's done a bit of acting , but a quick glance at the titles on his @entity47 page does n't reveal any blockbusters			0
that said , " @entity51 " does stand out as a potential must - see			0
i mean , after all , it features @entity54 playing a character named @entity56			0
so it must be good ! when the 40 - year - old @entity12 -- who has penned a memoir called " @entity60 , " in which he chronicles the unlikely path of his career from scrawny loser to comedy megastar -- met with @entity0 , he walked into the room wearing a t - shirt adorned with the image of that @entity70 - famous fat kid whose own shirt reads , @entity72 --- on the first date			1
but kinda sucks for a video editor			0
hence the blur in the video			0
you better tweet the hell out of this ...			0
