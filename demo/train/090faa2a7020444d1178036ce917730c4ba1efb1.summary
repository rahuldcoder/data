@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 canceled all service this weekend after severe wintry weather in northern @entity6 caused the breakdown of an " unprecedented " six trains , stranding thousands of passengers on both sides of the @entity11 on the weekend before @entity12			1
five trains with about 2,000 passengers stopped running friday night inside the @entity15 , also called the @entity15 , which runs between @entity16 and @entity6			1
a sixth train broke down saturday after @entity3 tried to run four trains from @entity0 to the @entity20 mainland in order to prepare for the resumption of normal service			1
about 700 people were aboard when that train stopped in the @entity27 area of @entity28			2
in a statement on its web site saturday , @entity3 said it will conduct a series of test trains sunday " to better understand the problems that have been occurring			1
" " we are committed to restoring our services as soon as possible but our key priority is the safety and comfort of our customers , " the statement said			0
those passengers affected by the breakdowns are being offered a full refund , another return ticket , and 150 pounds in compensation			1
about 25,000 people should have been traveling on saturday , @entity3 said			1
" we strongly recommend that travelers whose journeys are not essential change their tickets for travel on a later date or have their tickets refunded , " @entity3 said on its web site			1
the trains became stuck in the tunnel because the air inside was much warmer than the air outside the tunnel entrance in @entity6 , @entity3 spokeswoman @entity55 told @entity2			1
" it 's a bit like taking a bottle of beer out of the fridge into a warm room -- within minutes it 's covered in condensation , " said @entity3 ceo @entity61			2
" we think that was the principle cause of the electrical failures on the trains			2
" he called the number of breakdowns " completely unprecedented			0
" @entity75 , which operates the @entity15 , said it evacuated all 1,364 @entity3 passengers who were stuck friday after the trains " lost traction , " but one of the five trains remained in the tunnel and was blocking part of it , according to a @entity75 spokeswoman who asked not to be named , in keeping with policy			1
the train that broke down saturday was being towed back to the tunnel entry so passengers could be removed and transferred , @entity3 said			1
passengers evacuated friday night described how a trip that was supposed to take around two hours lasted more than 14 , factoring in the one - hour time difference between @entity0 and @entity92			1
" i left at 6:30 from @entity92 and we just arrived at 8 o'clock , " passenger @entity93 told @entity94 after arriving at @entity0 's @entity96 station , a @entity3 hub			1
he and other passengers complained they were given no food or water and little information during the ordeal			0
" it was a very upsetting experience for those passengers traveling , and we 're very sorry for what happened to them , " @entity61 said			0
" we will be taking a very close look at what happened [ and ] what lessons can be learned principally to actually understand why it was that we had five trains breaking down			0
" the problems started after 9 p.m. ( 4 p.m. et ) friday , when the first of the five @entity3 trains became stuck			1
it was helped out of the tunnel by a @entity75 locomotive , which took it all the way to @entity0 with passengers still on board , the @entity75 spokeswoman said			1
passengers on the second and third trains to fail were evacuated via the service tunnel to a @entity75 train , which brought them to the exit , she said			1
one of the failed trains was pulled out of the tunnel , but authorities were having difficulty removing the other , she said			0
the fourth and fifth trains were running close together when they failed , so @entity75 locomotives coupled them and either pushed or pulled them to the @entity1 side of the tunnel , the spokeswoman said			0
passengers from the fifth train boarded the one in front , and @entity75 locomotives then towed that train to @entity0 , she said			1
the @entity15 is actually two tunnels separated by a third and smaller service tunnel , so the train that remained stuck inside did not mean the entire tunnel was blocked , the @entity75 spokeswoman said			2
the @entity15 is 50.5 kilometers ( 31.4 miles ) long , 38 kilometers ( 23 miles ) of which are underwater			0
@entity61 said keeping passengers on the trains is the quickest and safest evacuation method			2
" because there were five trains , it took us ... longer than we would wish to get those trains out and those passengers on their way home , " he said			2
despite the stoppage of service saturday , noncommercial vehicles , including cars , motorbikes and camper vans , were still able to travel through the tunnel			2
@entity6 authorities told all trucks to get off the highways on the @entity6 side of the @entity11 because of the hazardous conditions , @entity75 spokesman @entity165 told @entity2			0
no trucks were entering the tunnel from the @entity6 side , and trucks were unable to enter on the @entity1 side because they would n't be allowed to drive upon reaching @entity6			0
the trouble resulted in a backup of freight traffic on either side of the tunnel , @entity165 said			0
on the @entity16 side , @entity179 early saturday implemented @entity181 , which goes into effect any time there is a problem affecting freight traffic in the tunnel			0
the operation lets police manage the backlog of trucks that builds up whenever the tunnel is closed			0
a @entity179 spokesman could not estimate how many trucks were waiting saturday morning but said @entity181 allows police to manage as many as 2,300 trucks			0
the poor weather in @entity6 also created problems for boats intending to sail across the @entity11 from @entity1			2
the @entity197 , a major exit point to @entity6 , was operating restricted services saturday because of weather problems in @entity201 , @entity6 , according to the port 's web site			1
" the @entity6 authorities prohibited traffic from leaving the @entity206 owing to the treacherous road conditions , which curtailed all services to @entity201 , " the port said			0
" tourist traffic is now being permitted to use the port and ships are sailing to @entity201			0
" it was not immediately clear whether freight traffic had resumed between @entity214 and @entity201			0
@entity2 's @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
