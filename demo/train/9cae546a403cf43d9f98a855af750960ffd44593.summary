if prosecutors plan to argue former @entity3 @entity2 was the one who fired seven rounds into @entity5 , they wo n't be able to show the alleged murder weapon to make their case			1
that 's because the .45 caliber gun used to kill @entity5 has never been found			1
" that 's a hurdle , " attorney and sports analyst @entity10 told @entity12			2
prosecutors have charged @entity2 , @entity17 and @entity18 with first - degree murder , however , more than a year since the june 17 , 2013 , homicide , prosecutors have yet to definitively say who was the alleged trigger man			1
all three men have pleaded not guilty			1
despite extensive searches of @entity2 's home , his apartment , his cars , an uncle 's home , the crime scene , woods , dumpsters , and a lake in @entity2 's hometown of @entity34 , @entity35 , what happened to the alleged murder weapon remains a mystery			1
inside the case against @entity2 " to be sure , someone can be convicted without a murder weapon , " @entity10 said			1
" authorities said in court that they recovered five rounds from @entity5 's body			1
an autopsy revealed two more rounds went through his body			2
those rounds were later dug up from the soil in the industrial park where @entity5 was shot			2
a shell casing was also found in the rental car that prosecutors say @entity2 drove to the crime scene			1
all the rounds are .45 caliber , according to authorities			0
who was @entity5 ? surveillance video from @entity2 's home security system shows the former @entity65 player arriving back at his house with two other people , according to the district attorney			1
prosecutors believe the gun seen in @entity2 's left hand is the alleged murder weapon , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation			1
" he 's last seen with the firearm before he goes down to the basement door , " @entity77 district attorney @entity76 told a judge at a june 16 hearing			0
two witnesses have testified before a grand jury that @entity2 kept a .45 gun in a black metal box in his basement , @entity76 told the court			2
fast facts : @entity2 the day after @entity5 's body was found , @entity2 sent a mysterious " coded " text message to his fiancée @entity92 and asked her get something out of their basement , according to search warrant affidavits			1
" go back in back of the screen in movie room when u ( sic ) get home an ( sic ) there is a box ... jus ( sic ) in case u ( sic ) were looking for it ! ! ! ... @entity108 bout that lol wink wink love u ttyl ...			0
@entity110 " " ttyl " is common shorthand for " talk to you later			0
" 2013 : investigation turns to fiancée a home surveillance video shows @entity92 leaving the house about an hour later and carrying something " rigid " and " consistent to a lock box or safe " placed inside a garbage bag and covered with children 's clothing , according to the documents			0
@entity92 later testified before a grand jury			0
according to prosecutor @entity76 , " she said it was a box ... and it was heavy , it was approximately 25 pounds			0
" on video , @entity92 is allegedly seen returning home without the " rigid " item			0
prosecutors said @entity92 testified she got rid of the box			0
" it goes into the dumpster , " @entity76 told a judge			0
" later on when she 's questioned about that , she ca n't recall where she put that			0
that item or items were never recovered			0
" @entity92 has been charged with perjury and has pleaded not guilty			1
her attorneys have said they will not comment on her case			0
in pre-trial hearings , @entity2 's lawyers have argued prosecutors have no evidence as to what was in the box			2
" i mean , who knows ? " co-counsel @entity148 told the court			0
" it could be drugs , it could be something that was connected to this crime that he knew about , that he was covering up for somebody else after the fact			0
there are all kinds of possibilities ... but that 's not probable cause that he committed murder			0
" authorities did seize other guns from the former tight end 's home and apartment , as well as .45 caliber ammunition			0
@entity2 also has pleaded not guilty to five other weapons - related charges			1
unlike the missing weapon in the @entity5 case , police have found a .38 caliber gun they accuse @entity2 of using to kill @entity174 and @entity175 in @entity176 in july 2012			1
police have not established a connection between the gun and @entity2			2
@entity2 is charged as the sole shooter in that case and has pleaded not guilty			1
can prosecutors persuade a jury in the @entity5 case that they do n't need to see the weapon involved ? " given the large number of tv shows devoted to crime ... jurors are always receptive to the popular defense argument that ' missing evidence ' creates reasonable doubt in prosecutor 's case , " said @entity12 analyst and former @entity187 prosecutor @entity186			1
yet , @entity186 added , authorities can argue there was plenty of time to ditch the weapon			2
" after all we still have n't found @entity203 , so explaining away a missing gun is not particularly difficult if other evidence is compelling and persuasive , " he said .			2

@entity2 has been charged with three killings
he has pleaded not guilty
the weapon used in the death of @entity5 has not been found
