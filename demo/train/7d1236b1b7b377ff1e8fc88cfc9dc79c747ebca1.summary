once a sleepy tropical paradise with little more than handful of ramshackle beach huts , the island of @entity3 , in the @entity1 ' @entity0 , has emerged from the backpacker trail to become one of @entity10 's hottest holiday destinations			1
in 2012 , @entity11 honoured it with the title " @entity14			0
" although @entity3 now hosts a wide range of resorts with even more under development , it 's the combination of seemingly endless stretches of white sandy beach and clear azure water that keeps visitors coming back			1
the island packs more than a dozen beaches into a surface area of just over 10 square kilometers ( 3.9 square miles )			2
here 's a selection of some of the best			0
@entity28 the beach that put @entity3 on the map is a five - kilometer expanse of white powdery sand , much of which is in fact finely ground coral			1
@entity28 is divided into three " stations " which date back to a quieter time when boats would glide through @entity28 's shallow waters to deliver visitors to @entity3 directly onto the sand before @entity42 on the island 's south east tip was built			1
today @entity28 is @entity3 's most developed stretch of shore , lined with resorts , hotels , bars , restaurants and even a shopping mall			1
the most expensive resorts , such as @entity53 are at the far end of @entity55 on the northern end of the beach ( which also boasts @entity28 's finest sand , often painstakingly raked and manicured by resort staff )			1
more budget - friendly establishments are to be found along @entity62 with accommodation along @entity64 falling in the mid-range bracket			1
@entity3 is known for its spectacular sunsets			2
due to @entity28 's west - facing orientation , it 's an ideal place to watch the sun sink into the ocean			2
after dark , @entity28 has a lively party scene			2
each month 's festivities peak with full moon and black moon parties			0
party destinations range from @entity77 , the beach 's biggest club , on the edge of @entity80 and two , to nearby @entity82 , with its @entity84 vibe			2
then there 's the debauched @entity86 , where partygoers can binge drink for national pride -- those foolish enough to drink 15 different shots of alcohol get their name and nationality on a small plaque on the bar 's wall			0
many bars along the @entity64 have live music , which is of the consistently high standard that has led to @entity1 musicians finding work in hotel bars the world over			0
@entity104 the @entity105 of @entity3 resembles an eight - kilometer - long chicken drumstick that someone has taken a bite out of			2
with this in mind , @entity104 lies on the eastern side of the long thin middle section of the island ( the bone of the drumstick )			2
opposite @entity28 , @entity104 greets the rising sun. at the island 's narrowest point , it 's less than a 700 - meter walk from its more glamorous and developed cousin and , at 2.5 kilometers , about half its length			1
from november to april , @entity104 bears the brunt of a blustery northern monsoonal wind known as the amihan			0
while wind - blown fine sand and debris rule the beach out as a place to sunbathe during amihan , its choppy waters are ideal for watersports such as kite boarding and windsurfing			2
the beach is lined with kite boarding schools , small bars catering to the kitesurfing and windsurfing crowd along with accommodation for kite boarding students and budget conscious travelers who want to avoid the crowds of @entity28			1
@entity146 ( @entity147 ) more commonly referred to on the island as @entity149 , this 800 - meter - long stretch of glistening white sand on @entity3 's northern tip is arguably @entity3 's most beautiful beach			1
its sand is coarser than @entity28 's due the high content of small puka shells			1
upon arrival by road , visitors are greeted by of stalls selling locally made shell jewelry and shell souvenirs			0
@entity164 has thus far escaped the rampant development seen on @entity3 's main beach and its coconut - palm - lined shores give visitors a feeling of what the island was like when it was known only to a lucky few			1
@entity172 technically the private beach of @entity175 's @entity174 and @entity176 , this attractive 100 - meter - long sheltered stretch of fine white sand to the west of @entity146 is framed by two high rocky outcrops and features comfortable sunbeds with large umbrellas and attentive waiters			1
@entity184 is accessible to non-guests , although it 's advisable to make a reservation for one of the @entity175 's bars or restaurants beforehand			0
@entity172 is also a great snorkeling spot with large shoals of fish just offshore			0
kayaks and @entity196 brand snorkeling gear are available for hire			0
mask and snorkel use is free to guests of the resort			0
@entity201 this small secluded beach , also far from the crowds of @entity28 , is located in the upper north eastern tip of the island around the corner from @entity146 and on the opposite side of the island to @entity172			1
more protected from northern winds than @entity104 , with two small rocky islands just off its northern edge , amihan still represents the off season for @entity201 's two small resorts			0
during this time the beach is lined with colourful fishing boats under repair			0
the best time to visit is from may to october , when the monsoon winds shift to the southwest , the season known as habagad			0
once the sea calms , @entity201 offers scenic snorkeling , but be warned : the beach has a strong current and is better suited to experienced swimmers .			0

@entity28 , the most developed on @entity3 , is the *shoreline* that put the island on the *tourist* map
being *constantly* raked and cared by resort staff , @entity62 boasts the best sand on @entity28
@entity146 has coarser sands but might be the most beautiful beach in @entity3
