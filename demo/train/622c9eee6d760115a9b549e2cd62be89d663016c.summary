@entity0 , @entity1 -- mingling with customers in the bar he opened two years ago , @entity3 is enjoying the booming consumer economy in his home city of @entity0 , in the @entity1			1
but despite the success of his bar , @entity11 , @entity3 worries that the boom is unsustainable and his customers could soon have no money to spend			1
" the economy itself is based on a bubble and you never know when this bubble will burst , " said @entity3			1
" it 's like living on the hand of a genie			0
" the city has boomed over the past five years , with new restaurants , cafes and even luxury hotels			0
the @entity1 's first five - star hotel , @entity29 , a locally owned franchise of the @entity32 chain , opened in 2010 , aimed primarily at corporate clients			1
like many , @entity3 worries that the new age of consumerism is just too good to be true			0
" since banks give loans , anyone who wants to open a business becomes a possibility			0
in that sense , it 's not hard to open it , " he said			0
" it 's not hard to get permission to open a bar from the municipality			2
from the ministry of economy , from the bank to get a loan , it 's not hard to do it , it was possible			2
" in this new economic world , @entity3 sometimes longs for the old days			0
" there were businesses , but they were more organic businesses that understood the conflict , that were able to survive the hardship of the occupation			0
" that 's based on more local products , consumption			2
enough , depending on what you have , " he added			0
the @entity69 describes the @entity70 as @entity71 , but @entity72 disputes the use of the term			1
@entity72 controls the flow of goods into and out of the @entity1 , it says , to maintain security and prevent terror attacks			0
most of the money in the economy comes from the government -- the @entity84 -- the largest employer in the @entity1 , and most of its money in turn comes from donor aid			1
many @entity88 are borrowing money to fund their basic needs and it is feared that , if donor aid dries up , many will be without work to fund their lifestyles			1
@entity95 , professor of financial economics at @entity97 , said : " so the money comes from donors , yes			2
the largest borrower from the banking sector in ( the @entity70 territories ) is the government , and that 's the danger			1
" the large debt , public debt , we have around $ 5 billion in public debt that consists of around 70 % of @entity108 , too huge for a government that 's just born			1
" a @entity111 report in july concluded that the @entity70 economy has grown at an average of 7.7 % a year between 2007 and 2011 , but that the growth was not sustainable			1
it said the growth had been driven by foreign aid and that the private sector would need to take over to strengthen the economy			1
@entity120 , lead author of the study , said in a press release : " economic sustainability can not be based on foreign aid so it is critical for the @entity84 to increase trade and spur private sector growth			1
" something the government says it is trying to do , even as it grapples with cash shortfalls			2
the economic boom also allowed @entity131 to follow her dream of opening the @entity1 's first ballet school			0
" when i was young and dancing ballet , i wished that i could do this and teach ballet , " said @entity131 , who opened her school last year with the help of her family			2
" i started it because in @entity0 we do n't have ballet schools , we do n't have dance schools in general			1
" however , now the costs are mounting and @entity131 is working two jobs to earn enough money to repay her parents			2
" i 'm young and i do n't have enough salary to go to the bank every month , " she said			0
" i needed to rent the place , a good place , to have floors and mirrors and sound system			0
" so my parents started to help me with it and now i 'm working two jobs to repay			0
" restaurant owner @entity156 said he feels the impact of @entity72 security restrictions , which mean he has to buy all his supplies from @entity72 wholesalers			2
" we have to build our country , " he said			0
" any country that 's been built from scratch will have a lot of debt			0
the question is where is this money being geared ? is it being geared at service providers ? " i do n't like to see service business , i like to see more self - sustaining businesses			1
" if the economy stalls , people will not have money to spend in bars like @entity3 's			1
" encouraging a kind of economy that you can spend , that there 's money to spend , that you can consume , in the same time you 're living on the edge of , not a catastrophe , of economical catastrophe , " said @entity3			1
" the minute the economy fails , the first thing people will stop doing is going to bars , restaurants			2
places like this will not survive in a destroyed economy			0
