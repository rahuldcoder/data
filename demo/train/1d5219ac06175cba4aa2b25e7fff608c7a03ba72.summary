-- monday morning , as we scrambled to get @entity3 off to school , there came a moment when the timeline of my life leapt into fast - forward			1
i was carrying around an @entity10 turned to @entity0 , checking in to see what news awaited me at work , while @entity3 danced around me , knowing my partner or i would turn off the tv if watching it slowed her down			1
then , suddenly , something brought us to a halt			2
" president @entity19 is speaking at @entity20 today , " the news reader said			1
our eyes widened , and we shot each other a smile			2
the president was speaking at @entity26 's school			1
i had arrived at @entity20 in 1983 , fresh from a school run by @entity29 priests , where gay groups were banned from the premises			1
a boy i 'd known had been severely harassed for being gay			2
@entity20 was a long step better , but on the first day of college , my dorm mates fell into silence when one young woman delivered this news : " i have two mothers , " she said			1
i remember asking whether one was her stepmother			2
" no. my mothers are gay , " she said			1
" they had me together			2
" she looked so uncomfortable , and no one was stepping up to make her feel any better			2
back then , @entity20 had openly gay and lesbian professors and a group for students who were gay			1
but in 1983 , it was still not cool to be a lesbian ; @entity51 was beginning to surface on campus , and discussions over sexuality and condom use quickly became explosive			2
@entity20 , a @entity57 women 's college , had been embroiled in a battle over whether to merge with @entity60 's men 's college , @entity59 , where @entity19 was graduating that year			1
the buzz at @entity20 was that nobody wanted it to be known as a college for " dykes			1
" it was just another political debate to me			2
i was happily dating a wonderful guy , and it did n't affect me			0
sexuality is a complicated thing			0
sudden pressure to get ' gay married ' that was the same year @entity74 started a thesis at @entity76 on why gay people should have the freedom to marry			0
he had read an award - winning book by @entity81 , a prominent @entity82 professor , who argued that @entity83 , particularly @entity84 , had once been ok with homosexuality			0
@entity74 believed that if things had once been different , there was an opening for society to reconsider			0
he made this argument : " you ca n't say you 're for equality if you acquiesce to exclusion from the central social and legal institution of society , which is marriage			0
" i 'm her mom , not the nanny ! he spent a career saying marriage rights could be the agent for social change around attitudes toward homosexuality , which prompted some folks to tell him he was flat - out nuts			0
in 1991 , he served as co-counsel in a lawsuit by a group of @entity112 gay couples against the state , alleging that it was unconstitutional for the state to forbid two people of the same sex to marry			0
in 1996 , their @entity118 agreed			0
@entity74 has launched a national movement toward allowing gays the freedom to marry			0
by 2001 , 10 countries allowed gays to marry			0
by 2005 , our neighbors in @entity127 granted marriage licenses to gays , and my partner and i attended our first wedding of a couple who had traveled there from the @entity135 to wed. i remember the voice of this heterosexual justice of the peace cracking as he called himself a participant in history in the making			0
what a distance we have traveled as a society , even as our country debates whether allowing gay couples to marry is the right thing to do			0
there are six @entity135 states that now allow gay couples to marry and an additional 12 that offer domestic partnerships or civil unions that are similar to marriage			0
there are 30 states that ban them			0
the federal government recognizes none of these unions , thus denying the couples hundreds of significant federal marriage rights			0
@entity19 spoke at @entity20 on monday about how we arrived here and how much further we have to go : " young folks who marched and mobilized , who stood up and sat in from @entity162 to @entity163 to @entity164 , did n't just did n't do it for themselves			1
that 's how we achieved voting rights			2
that 's how we achieved workers ' rights ; that 's how we achieved gay rights ; that 's how we 've made this union more perfect			2
" ' @entity26 , would you please speak @entity176 ? ' a year after that wedding in @entity127 , my partner and i had our daughter , @entity3 , and were legally bound to her through a second parent adoption , even as we could not marry each other			1
@entity3 is now 6 , an age when kids really ca n't conceive of the future but seem to find comfort in recounting the past			1
" what was it like when i was a baby " quickly reaches back to " what was it like when you were a baby ? " so she had a broad smile the day i enrolled her at @entity196 and they told her she would be taking swim class at @entity20			1
" that 's your college , mama ! let 's go see ! " she said and pulled me and my partner , @entity203 , onto campus			2
i showed her the pool i barely touched as a student and bought her an electric blue sweatshirt with @entity20 emblazoned on the front			1
she could sense the emotion in my voice when i told her what a life - changing experience it had been for a first - generation @entity135 to go to an @entity214 school			0
@entity20 used to say it " makes women , " and the confidence and smarts it instilled were something i want for her , too			1
i told her one too many times that she would have to study very hard to get in			0
she ran along the patio in front of buildings named for women who 'd accomplished incredible things			0
i walked around with my partner , wondering whether we would ever be able to afford to send her to a place so great , where i once met a girl raised by two mommies who struggled to explain herself and find support			0
monday afternoon , 594 young women , in their light blue caps and gowns , graduate from @entity20 of @entity60			1
they will honor @entity239 , a former trustee and an out lesbian @entity240 , for her contributions to the university			0
@entity74 received the same medal of distinction @entity20 gave to the president of the @entity135 , days after @entity19 declared his personal support for marriage rights for gays			1
@entity19 called upon the women at @entity20 to change society for the better as the women who raised him had taught him , to persevere -- that in this country , " no matter who you love or what @entity257 you worship , you can still purse your own happiness			1
" this is my alma mater , the same college our little girl talks of attending some day because it 's " @entity26 's school , " where it will be of absolutely no consequence that her mothers are gay .			1

@entity19 spoke monday at @entity20 , @entity272 's alma mater
@entity272 recalls that when a dorm mate said she had two mothers , other students fell silent
her daughter , @entity3 , wants to follow in her mother 's footsteps by attending @entity20
