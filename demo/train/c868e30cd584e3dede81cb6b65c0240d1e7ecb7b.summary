-- all good things must come to an end			2
or in the case of @entity6 's hit series , " @entity7 , " all bad things must meet the true death			1
after seven dark and twisted seasons of the drama , based on @entity12 ' " @entity11 , " fans of the show -- referred to as " @entity15 " -- must say their final goodbyes to @entity17 ( @entity18 ) , @entity19 ( @entity20 ) , @entity21 ( @entity22 ) and the rest of the supernatural creatures of @entity11 this sunday			1
while some fans have argued the show 's quality has declined over the years , it does n't mean people have stopped watching			2
here are the storylines we 're absolutely dying to have wrapped up in the final episode : will there be a true cure to @entity35 ? @entity36 , a disease that infects both humans and vampires and is lethal to the latter , has been the main plot point of season seven			1
at first , the disease caused bloodsuckers to lose their minds and eat humans at an alarming rate			2
@entity47 through the season it began to transform and just weakened the vampires until eventually they withered away			1
yes , @entity50 's blood contains the cure to @entity35 , but only a select few actually know this -- and mr. @entity53 ( @entity54 ) wants to keep it that way			1
instead of releasing the real cure to the world , he has teamed up with @entity21 and @entity59 ( @entity60 ) to synthesize a partial antidote			1
that way , infected vampires will need to take the medicine regularly without ever being fully cured			2
smart business move , but no doubt morally corrupt			2
@entity50 ( @entity67 ) has spent the last few episodes held captive , but will she finally escape in the series finale ? or will @entity21 and @entity59 turn on @entity53 and release the cure to the world ? could this maker - progeny duo actually make an ethical decision that does n't also benefit them financially ? only time will tell			1
but as tensions rise between @entity53 and @entity21 , fans can definitely expect a showdown			2
especially now that @entity17 is in @entity53 ' crosshairs			2
and everyone knows when it comes to @entity17 , @entity21 does not mess around			2
will our favorite non-vampires find happiness ? characters such as @entity85 ( @entity86 ) , @entity88 ( @entity87 ) and @entity89 ( @entity90 ) may not have a thirst for blood , but they certainly find themselves in consistent danger			1
so who makes it out ( emotionally ) alive ? things are looking pretty good for resident shape - shifter @entity97			1
he has n't been at the forefront of the action much this year , spending most of his time ignoring his mayoral duties in lieu of protecting his pregnant girlfriend , @entity104 ( @entity103 )			2
he even agreed to her demand that they move to raise their unborn child in a safe place			2
@entity85 's gotten the short end of the stick throughout the series , so here 's hoping he finally gets that happy ending he deserves			1
@entity88 has also suffered a lot of loss , but , like @entity85 , life is starting to turn around			2
everyone 's favorite cross-dressing fry cook might have even found love -- with @entity121 's boyfriend , @entity122 ( @entity120 )			1
@entity88 is a fan favorite and the writers will most likely allow him to ride off into the sunset with this dreamy guitarist			2
the fiery , redheaded waitress , now owner of @entity133 's @entity132 , has suffered the loss of two men in her life : former fiancé @entity137 , who turned out to be a psychopathic murderer and was killed by @entity17 ; and war veteran @entity133 , who made her happy but was then killed by a hit man			2
but through it all @entity89 has been a survivor , always coming out on top			0
and it looks like she may find love once again -- this time with ancient vampire @entity145 ( @entity146 ) , who is absolutely smitten with her			0
but who would n't be ? will @entity149 actually be able to keep his pants on ? for seven seasons , @entity149 ( @entity151 ) has been in trouble dozens of times , all because he is unable to control himself when it comes to members of the opposite sex -- including @entity158 ( @entity159 ) , @entity50 , @entity160 ( @entity161 ) , @entity121 ( @entity162 ) and @entity163 ( @entity164 )			0
the relationships ' ends have often been messy -- physically so			1
but now that @entity121 and @entity168 ( @entity169 ) have finally rekindled their romance ( rejoice ! ) , this is the perfect time for @entity149 to re-evaluate his life choices			0
while most fans may cry at the thought of a celibate @entity176 , it may be for the greater good of @entity11 that he keep his pants on for at least a little while			0
of course , no one says he has to keep his shirt on for the finale			0
this is " @entity7 , " after all			1
who will meet the true death ? current " @entity7 " show runner @entity185 , who replaced original creator @entity186 , promised there would be game - changing deaths in the final season , and he was n't kidding			1
within the first minute of the opening episode , @entity192 ( @entity193 ) was staked and killed by a @entity35 - infected vampire			1
the death happened off - screen , too -- talk about a cold exit			1
a few episodes later , @entity17 's werewolf boyfriend , @entity201 ( @entity200 ) , got the ax as well			0
he died while protecting @entity17 , a common theme in the series			0
but ever since those deaths it has been unusually tame			0
which prompts the question , who will bite it in the series finale ? the obvious choice going in would be @entity214			0
infected with the @entity215 ( at an alarming rate due to @entity17 's faerie blood ) , he refused to drink from @entity50 and cure himself , stating that he had accepted his fate to die			1
he claims he is making this decision in an attempt to save @entity17 from his own " darkness			0
" kind of seems like an anti-climactic way for his character to go out , though			0
early predictions from fans had @entity21 as a main contender to die -- and it seemed likely with him contracting the @entity35 virus early in the final season			1
but now that he 's sampled from the fountain of @entity50 , he is officially cured			0
could this be a ploy to fool viewers into thinking he is safe ? it seems rather fitting for his character to go out in a blaze of glory			1
and what about @entity238 ? yes , she is the show 's main character , but crazier things have happened			1
besides , some would argue she is partially responsible for all of the terrible things to befall the town of @entity11 , so maybe a death would be satisfying to some fans			0
besides , no one has put themselves in more dangerous situations in the seven - season run than @entity17			1
that girl can not keep herself out of trouble			0
who will @entity17 choose ? " @entity7 " began with a love story , and the question still lingers : who will our heroine , @entity238 , end up with ? first there was @entity214 , @entity17 's primary love interest			1
they broke up occasionally , but @entity17 always found her way back to him			1
( possibly because actors @entity18 and @entity20 are married in real life			0
) then there was @entity21			0
@entity266 everywhere squealed when they got together			0
but while their chemistry was magnetic , they spent more time against one another than actually coupled			0
there was also @entity270 ( @entity271 ) , because who would n't fall in love with a faerie vampire who is responsible for murdering your parents and hunting you over the years ? and then the doomed relationship with @entity201 , the gorgeous werewolf who never stood a chance			0
based on this season , it appears @entity17 will end up with @entity19			1
they have spent the majority of the year rekindling their original romance			0
@entity17 has made it very clear that all she wants is for @entity19 to live			0
but the idea of @entity19 still being alive at the end of this season is looking less and less likely			1
that would leave @entity21 , which would certainly please the fans			0
but if it only happens by default after @entity19 dies , does that cheapen their relationship ? here 's a thought -- maybe @entity17 should end up alone			0
it 's almost unheard of in a vampire love story , but something that might need to happen for fans to finally respect her			0
each season she has put herself in danger over her inability to stay away from particular men			1
maybe she will finally make the right choice , pack up her bags , and leave @entity11 for good			0
it would be a bold move and sure to anger many fans , but hey -- at least it would be a surprise			0
goodbyes suck , but hopefully this one wo n't			0
the series finale of " @entity7 " airs sunday at 9 p.m. on @entity6 , which -- like @entity0 -- is a unit of @entity316 .			1

" @entity7 " ends seven - season run on sunday
viewers wonder if cure for lethal @entity35 will be found
many characters have paired off : will relationships stick ?
@entity238 has been at *center* of many concerns
