one can not choose to not be a pedophile , but one can choose to not be a child molester			1
as details of the accusations of sexual abuse emerged from the @entity7 trial , and as the public looks on with horror , a central element to the case that has received scant attention is pedophilia itself			1
" @entity20 " was long used as a synonym for " child molestation , " and both were often seen as psychological failures of self - control			1
child molesters were thought to be acting out their own histories of abuses , reacting to fears of adult relationships , or manifesting a symptom that might be resolved in psychotherapy , after which they would no longer be pedophilic			1
recently , however , a number of studies have starting changing that view			1
it appears that one can be born with a brain predisposed to experience sexual arousal in response to children			1
pedophilic men have significantly less white matter , which is the connective tissue that is responsible for communication between different regions in the brain			0
pedophiles perform more poorly on various tests of brain function , tend to be shorter in height and are three times more likely to be left - handed or ambidextrous ( characteristics that are observable before birth )			1
although nonbiological features may yet turn up to be relevant , it is difficult , if not impossible , to explain the research findings without there being a strong role of biology			1
no one has been able to find a way to change pedophiles into nonpedophiles			2
but that does not mean we can not prevent child molestation			2
sexual preference for children does n't have to result in actual sexual behaviors toward children			2
cases of child molestation that involve long strings of victims over the course of years illustrate what can happen when someone gives in to , or outright indulges , his sexual interests , regardless of its potential damage on others			1
it is those cases that dominate headlines and provoke revulsion toward pedophiles			2
an untold number of cases merit sympathy			0
the science suggests that they are people who , through no fault of their own , were born with a sex drive that they must continuously resist , without exception , throughout their entire lives			0
little if any assistance is ever available for them			0
they are often unable to consult mental health professionals ( because of mandatory reporting rules ) ; their families will often disown rather than support them ; and despite the openness of the @entity101 , there are few options for coming out and joining communities of other pedophiles for mutual support			2
having encountered thousands of cases , it is my experience that the pedophiles who do go on to become actual child molesters do so when they feel the most desperate			1
yet , much of what society does has been to increase rather than decrease their desperation			0
in the @entity116 especially , the great majority of attention is on punitive measures , invoked after the fact			0
however , the more beneficial social policies may be those aimed at prevention			1
the best example of this effort is the @entity124 in @entity125 , supported financially by private donation			0
it began with a media campaign aimed at people struggling to resist their sexual interests to children			1
by offering counseling and other services , it is expected that they can remain offense - free			0
hundreds of people contacted the @entity124 project after it was established			0
people from all over the world , including @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 , turned to the assistance			0
another example is the @entity144 , which was developed in @entity145			0
the programs are staffed by volunteers who have received training from professionals			0
they provide support to people who are under no mandate to attend but are nonetheless seeking help to not commit sexual offenses			2
it 's too early to tell whether these efforts are effective over the long term , but preliminary reports are encouraging			0
even though very few researchers study the causes of pedophilia , we hope that the scientific community will learn more as new tools and opportunities become available			0
if it is the brain 's wiring that ultimately determines who will go on to develop pedophilia , can we detect it early enough to interrupt the process ? until we uncover more information , we will do more good by making it easier for pedophiles to come in for help rather than force them into solitary secrecy .			1

@entity179 : in @entity7 case , a central element that has been overlooked is pedophilia
@entity179 : one can not choose to not be a pedophile , but one can choose to not be a child molester
he says recent studies suggest that biology plays a *crucial* role in sexual *attraction*
@entity179 : we can help pedophiles by developing efforts aimed at counsel and prevention
