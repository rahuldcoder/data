@entity0 , a conservative three - term senator , is in an unusually tough race in deep - red @entity8 with independent businessman @entity9 , whom @entity0 attacked hard about what he 's calling questionable business dealings with @entity12 , a former @entity13 executive convicted of insider trading			1
" he is n't honest about his liberal ideology , and he is n't coming clear about his business record , " @entity0 said			2
" mr. @entity9 is using his business record as a sole qualification for his candidacy , but the truth is mr. @entity9 built his business career working with one of @entity13 's biggest criminals , avoiding taxes , and laying off hard - working @entity6			1
" @entity0 ' low poll numbers have garnered national attention in a year @entity1 could win a @entity28 majority			2
it 's been over 80 years since @entity8 elected a @entity31 senator , and party members do n't want the @entity34 state to be the reason they remain in the minority during the next @entity37			2

former presidential candidate @entity73 will be in @entity8 later this month , @entity0 said			1
tea party supporters also have given @entity0 the support he 'll need to win in november , even after their preferred candidate , dr. @entity76 , lost to him in the primary earlier this year			1
@entity78 has already stumped for @entity0 , and sen. @entity79 of @entity80 will kick off a statewide bus tour campaign this friday			1
asked why @entity9 's business experience and position in favor of immigration reform like the @entity5 's did n't qualify him for the endorsement , @entity82 said , " i would argue there are very few positions where we share a common view			1
@entity93 , @entity6 energy exploration , cap - and - trade , @entity95			0
he 's either on the wrong side or wo n't say where he stands			0
