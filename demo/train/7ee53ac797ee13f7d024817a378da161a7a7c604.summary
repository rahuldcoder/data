-- it 's a mesmerizing , surreal scene			2
eight tiny , unmanned aerial vehicles -- called quadrotors -- begin to rise from the ground in unison			1
they hover at eye level , filling the room with a heavy buzzing sound			2
then they move through a makeshift window , one at a time , and reform as a group on the other side			0
this is n't happening on a @entity17 set , and it is n't science fiction			0
these real - life flying robots are at the @entity22 's @entity23 " this is a robot that 's completely autonomous , " said doctoral student @entity24 , " and by that i mean there 's no remote control in the background			1
" the lab is a mechanical engineer 's dream			1
quadrotors in all shapes , sizes and colors -- and in various degrees of assembly -- cover nearly every surface			1
shelves line the walls , filled to the brim with tools and toys			0
most noticeable is the lab 's state - of - the - art @entity47 motion - capture system			1
infrared cameras placed throughout a test - flying area communicate with tiny sensors on the quadrotors , feeding into a computer - based navigation system			1
" we have the @entity47 system , or the red lights , which allow us to figure out where the robot is , " @entity24 explained			0
" then we 're able to send it commands about what we 'd like it to do and group behaviors that you 'll see			1
" @entity24 gives the quadrotors simple instructions via computer , but the vehicles decide how to get from @entity69 on their own			1
the results are a dazzling display of formations , from spinning in circles in midair to navigating obstacles in sync with each other			0
other quadrotors at the @entity79 have worked together to carry cargo and build structures			1
" these robots are able to pick up these simple , almost @entity84 - like bricks , and they 're able to carry them from one location to another , " @entity24 said			1
but perhaps the quadrotors ' most memorable moment was when they played instruments to perform the @entity92 theme song			1
the video has more than 3 million views on @entity95			1
as much fun as @entity24 and his colleagues seem to be having , he says their ultimate goal is to put quadrotors to good use outside the lab. after the 2011 earthquake in @entity108 , a team from the @entity22 and @entity105 in @entity106 took quadrotors into the disaster zone			1
led by @entity112 , a former @entity79 director and professor at @entity22 , they achieved some remarkable accomplishments			1
among them : sending quadrotors -- equipped with cameras and lasers -- into an unstable building to see what sort of information they could gather			2
" we went into a collapsed building ; we mapped three floors , " @entity112 said			0
" we got three - dimensional maps , and we were able to show that this sort of thing is feasible today			0
" @entity129 could also use sensors to detect radiation levels and other biological hazards , @entity112 said			0
that could help keep first responders out of harm 's way			0
" clearly , humans will always have a role to play in emergency response for law enforcement , " @entity112 said			0
" but if there 's an emergency , if there 's a 911 call , the question is , do you want a human dashing off to respond to it right away ? " @entity112 also saw an opportunity for quadrotors to be used when law enforcement was close to apprehending a suspect in the @entity153 bombings			2
" after the tragic incident in @entity153 , you saw that robot actually ripping away the canvas on top of the boat to try to look behind the cover " for the suspect , he said , " it 's an excruciatingly , painfully slow operation			0
what we 'd like to do is accomplish these tasks really quickly			0
" there are plenty of positive uses for quadrotors			2
but the concept of stealthy , camera - toting robots does cause concern for some people			2
@entity112 often fields questions about misuse of the technology and privacy concerns			0
" i think we should engage in a public dialogue about when to use them , what the potential benefits are , and recognize that we can protect ourselves against abuse of these devices -- as opposed to saying ' we do n't want to develop this , ' " he said			0
for now , most of the research on these robots is still done in the lab. but you could say their potential is sky high .			2

at @entity22 lab , researchers have created small aerial robots
the quadrotor takes commands but is *programmed* to decide how to do them
a @entity95 video of quadrotors playing the @entity92 theme reached millions
they were used in *post-earthquake* @entity108 to *investigate* *damaged* buildings
