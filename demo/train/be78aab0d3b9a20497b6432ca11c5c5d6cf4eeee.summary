@entity0 -- as tens of thousands of athletes , team officials and visitors gather in @entity0 ahead of the @entity7 opening ceremony on friday , security is paramount for the @entity9 organizers and @entity11 authorities			1
and perhaps the biggest headache of all is the challenge of safeguarding the more than 100 heads of state and foreign dignitaries who will attend the opening ceremony at the @entity16 -- @entity20 , first lady @entity18 and @entity19 presidential hopeful @entity17 among them			1
but should visitors and competitors be worried ? security concerns hit the headlines this month when it emerged that private security contractor @entity27 , which was supposed to have provided 10,400 guards for the @entity9 and @entity29 , would not be able to deliver			1
as a result , the government is deploying 18,200 troops -- many more than planned and almost twice as many as are in @entity33 -- in order to remedy the shortfall			1
about 1,200 of those were called up just this week after being placed on standby			1
nonetheless , culture secretary @entity37 , the minister responsible for the @entity9 , said tuesday that the government " continues to have every confidence that we will deliver a safe and secure games			1
" the decision to call up the extra troops was down to ministers ' determination to " leave nothing to chance , " as they prepare for the largest peacetime event ever staged in @entity11 , he said			1
" @entity27 numbers continue to rise significantly and we have every expectation that will continue to be the case , " @entity37 added			1
with three days to go before the opening ceremony , @entity27 said it had around 5,800 security personnel deployed at @entity7 venues , with more being trained and accredited " each day			1
" last week , it said it hoped to have 7,000 fully accredited by the start of the @entity9 , still thousands fewer than it was contracted to provide			2
while the recruitment failure by @entity27 is highly embarrassing for the company , the @entity9 ' organizers insist that their contingency planning will keep everyone safe			1
visitors can certainly expect to see far more visible security measures in place than usual at @entity9 venues and transport hubs			1
the @entity68 is also guarding the games with two warships , @entity72 jet fighters , @entity74 helicopters and , perhaps most controversially , surface - to - air missiles on apartment buildings near the stadium , despite objections from residents			2
@entity80 , the chairman of the @entity0 organizing group , @entity81 , has said the only real difference resulting from the @entity27 debacle will be in the " mix of security " checking on those at @entity7 venues			1
home secretary @entity88 gave a similar message when she was grilled by lawmakers on the matter , saying , " there is no question of @entity7 security being compromised			1
" critics have been less positive , with some @entity97 lawmakers concerned that security will be inadequate or that the prominent military presence will make visitors uncomfortable			1
security officials in the @entity19 say they are supporting the host nation 's efforts during the @entity9			1
the @entity19 intelligence community has set up a 24/7 center to analyze all threat information coming in during the @entity9 in @entity0 , a senior @entity19 counterterrorism official said wednesday			0
@entity108 , director of the @entity109 , told the @entity110 that the upcoming games " present a potential target for terrorists and other disruptive groups			0
" he said the @entity19 is working closely with its @entity11 counterparts to collect , analyze and share potential threat information with the goal of making sure they can " respond quickly to prevent any possible plotting tied to the @entity9			0
" defense secretary @entity120 said last week that @entity121 has offered " whatever assistance " the @entity11 needs " in order to ensure that proper security is provided			1
" the chief executive of @entity27 , @entity126 , was forced to agree under questioning from lawmakers that the security staffing fiasco is " a humiliating shambles for the country			1
" the firm has also agreed to meet the cost of the extra troop deployment , which could run to $ 77 million			0
the @entity134 said that @entity27 was suffering from a software problem , which means the contractor can not guarantee who will turn up where and whether guards have the right training			1
the guards employed by @entity27 will be responsible chiefly for such tasks as providing venue perimeter security , a spokesman for the contractor said			1
this includes manning x-ray machines , searching people , searching vehicles and operating closed - circuit television systems , he said			0
people with tickets for @entity7 events have been sent e-mails giving details of the security requirements for each venue			1
these include airport - style limits on the size of bags that can be carried and the quantity of liquids that can be taken in			0
one such e-mail reads , " be prepared for security checks when you arrive : this will be like taking an international flight at an airport			2
it will be busy and you will have to queue , so get there early			0
" the 18,200 @entity11 military personnel deployed for the @entity9 are to help out with the security checks and stewarding at venues , as well as specialist tasks such as bomb disposal and sniffer dog searches			1
the @entity180 's largest ship , the helicopter carrier @entity182 , is moored in the @entity183 off @entity184 , where it will be a base for helicopter operations and house troops providing security at the @entity7 venue			1
additional airspace restrictions are also in force around @entity0 and the southeast			0
police in @entity0 and elsewhere also will play a big role in ensuring security			2
well before the @entity27 debacle hit the headlines , @entity0 's @entity196 , known as the @entity196 , was planning what it says is its biggest - ever peacetime operation			1
the operation will " run for 66 days and cover over 1,000 venues , including those hosting @entity7 and @entity205 sports , cultural events and 2012 - themed celebrations taking place across the capital , " the @entity196 website says			0
on the busiest days , up to 9,500 police officers will be used , including some from forces outside @entity0 , for games - related operations , it says			0
officers at @entity7 venues will focus on preventing crime and keeping people and their property safe , while @entity27 is responsible for the security operation , it says			1
away from the venues , the @entity196 will also have to provide the usual policing for the city and its visitors			0
the @entity9 come just over a year after parts of @entity0 were rocked by rioting that led to police being brought in from elsewhere in @entity229 to help restore control			0
the threat of a potential terrorist strike has also been in the news in recent days after a number of arrests , although police said the operations were not linked to the @entity9			0
the terror threat level on the @entity134 website remains unchanged at " substantial , " which is the third highest of five levels			0
the next level up is " severe , " which means an attack is " highly likely , " and the highest is " critical , " meaning an attack is " expected imminently			0
" government officials from @entity121 to @entity0 insist that there are no known specific or credible terror threats tied to the @entity9			2
travel to and around the @entity11 will nevertheless be a focus of security efforts			2
visitors arriving at @entity0 's @entity253 can expect to see every desk at passport control manned during the @entity9 , the home secretary has said			0
immigration desks have extra staffers , @entity253 said monday , amid fears of long lines to get into the country as security checks are carried out			2
retired border officials and retired police officers are among those being brought in to supplement immigration staff , the @entity134 said			2
a planned strike by some border staff has been called off , easing fears of long lines at passport control			2
@entity19 officials may also be lending a hand at @entity253			0
the @entity11 @entity271 said a small number of staff from the @entity19 @entity274 would be based at certain @entity11 airports " to act as an on - site liaison for the @entity274			2
" the @entity274 staffers will not , however , be conducting security screening or inspections , the @entity271 said			2
meanwhile , @entity0 's public transport authorities have been warning commuters for weeks to avoid travel hotspots around the time of the @entity9 -- but have not stressed any additional security risk			2
the city 's transport network is not immune to terror threats , as the attacks of july 2005 showed			0
but visitors can seek reassurance in the fact that @entity11 's police and intelligence officials have been successful since then in foiling attacks on the capital			0
in the 2005 incident , three bombs were detonated on underground trains and one on a bus in the city			0
the blasts killed 52 people and wounded more than 770			0
@entity0 mayor @entity304 told @entity1 's @entity305 that while the city 's authorities are not complacent , he is confident in their ability to keep visitors safe			0
" we do everything in our power to maximize security at the venues , and that 's working well now -- the army , the military as well as @entity27 are providing very safe conditions on the site , plus there is a huge amount of work that nobody has seen involving the intelligence service , " he said " that 's something about an event like this -- you listen out for what may or may not be happening on the @entity330 , you try as hard as you possibly can to monitor the potential suspects			1
" @entity304 said it is impossible to guard against all " unknown unknowns , " and that 's why strong security is needed at venues			2
" at no stage can you guarantee that someone wo n't do something moronic , stupid , violent and tragic ; not just in @entity0 , but the whole of the @entity11 is a potential target in this period , " he said			0
but at the same time , he said , " the intelligence is as reassuring as it could be under the circumstances			0
the threat level , as far as we are aware , has slightly come down in the last 12 months , but you can never be certain			0
" @entity1 's @entity348 contributed to this report .			0
