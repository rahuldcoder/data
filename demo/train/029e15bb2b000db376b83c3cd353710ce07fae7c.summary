-- this is n't the idealism of " @entity3			0
" it is n't as dark as " @entity5 , " either			0
so how about settling on something lighter , like say , " @entity7 , " in which the dean famously says , " the time has come for someone to put his foot down			0
and that foot is me			0
" and so it goes with sen. @entity15 , at least when it comes to killing @entity17			1
the first - term @entity18 is the self - appointed executioner of a law @entity21 despise			1
but truth be told , it 's hard to figure out exactly what @entity15 's faux filibuster on the @entity26 floor this week was really about			1
he 's against big , bad @entity17 , we get it			1
only he was asking @entity26 @entity21 to vote against something that would actually kill @entity17			1
none of this has been about reality			0
rather , it 's about cementing a new definition of leadership : positioning yourself as the spokesman for your political base by telling it exactly what it wants to hear			1
in @entity15 's case , it 's the @entity46 base			1
lucky for him , there 's a made - for - tv bully pulpit , plenty of time to talk and the talking points are easy and oh , so , predictable			2
@entity53 fed up over @entity55 shutdown battle consider this sound bite extraordinaire : " this is a fight to restore freedom to the people , " says @entity15 , clearly not inhibited by any lack of self - importance			1
" this is a fight to get the @entity63 establishment , the empire , to listen to the people			0
" not exactly @entity66 , but it 's a whammy of a bite			0
in it , @entity15 gets to cuddle the tea party while taking on the evil establishment — and by that he means the awful folks in his own party who would not shut down the government over a doomed move to kill @entity17			1
imagine that : republicans refusing to catapult a man they do n't like into the presidential arena			0
maybe they 're part of @entity15 's evil establishment , but if they are , they 're trying to save him — and the party — from itself on the issue of shutting down the government			1
@entity15 is thinking 2016 , but they 're thinking about the repercussions for the @entity18 if the government shuts down			1
while some polls show that two - thirds of tea party sympathizers are just fine with a shutdown over health care reform , a majority of independent voters are not			0
and last time i checked , those are the folks whom the @entity18 needs to win over if its going to win the @entity101			2
right now , @entity15 has divided the @entity21 in a @entity103 way , only worse because he is an actual senator with actual authority who could have an actual presidential candidacy			1
" we have been beaten up by his so - called grassroots movement back home			0
they pound us with ads , we hear about what he wants at town halls			0
we do n't like @entity17 , either			2
but there 's another way to go about this , " says a senior @entity5 @entity21			2
" he [ @entity15 ] won one primary in a red state in a @entity21 year , and now he 's busy running for president			1
" oh , and by the way , he adds , " he 's all about raising money			0
and doing it at our expense			0
" why is it at the @entity18 's expense ? because @entity21 are now afraid of being challenged from the right in primaries			1
they 're not worried about their @entity127 opponents ; they 're worried about the opponents on their right whom , many believe , @entity15 would support and throw them under the bus			2
they 're against @entity17 , but are they against it enough ? " he 's a demagogue - and - a - half , " complains the @entity5 @entity21			1
" this is not what you do to your teammates			0
" ah , but that 's the crux of it all : @entity15 does n't need a team			2
he 's got the floor to himself			0
and he 's got the people , right ? that is , until he does n't			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity146 .			2

sen. @entity15 spent more than 21 hours *arguing* against funding for @entity17
@entity146 : @entity15 's actions are perplexing , but he may be trying to be a @entity18 spokesman
she says @entity15 wants to cuddle to the @entity46 base by *advocating* a shutdown
@entity146 : @entity15 has divided the @entity21 in a @entity103 way
