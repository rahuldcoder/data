-- @entity1 , the former chief executive of @entity2 , was unhappy that the @entity3 reported a 0.3 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate on friday			1
in fact , he was sufficiently unhappy that he accused the @entity8 administration of using its control over the @entity3 to cook the numbers in a tweet just after the unemployment rate was reported			2
he even repeated the claim in a @entity15 opinion piece on wednesday			0
perhaps @entity1 could get away with this sort of temper tantrum nonsense when he was running one of the biggest companies in the world , but he will only get ridicule pushing this line in policy debates			1
@entity24 does n't have any clue about how the unemployment data are collected , or he is just a liar			2
first , it is important to understand that the @entity29 -- the division of the @entity3 that reports data on unemployment -- is run by career civil servants			1
ordinarily , the commissioner is a well - respected academic economist who is appointed by the president			0
however , since the previous commissioner left this year , @entity36 , a career civil servant , stepped up to fill the role of acting commissioner			1
this means the bureau does not have a single political appointee			2
@entity44 : @entity1 says he 's quitting it is also important to understand the way the data for the survey are compiled and published			1
the survey involves hundreds of people at various stages in the process of collecting and compiling the data			2
even if @entity36 or some other top official in the bureau wanted to lie about the numbers , they could n't possibly do it alone			2
suppose they just changed the unemployment rate from a " true " rate of 8.1 % to a bogus 7.8 % rate			0
they would have the problem that this 7.8 % number was inconsistent with the data on unemployment rates for whites and african - americans			2
or it would turn out to be inconsistent with the data on unemployment for young people and old people			2
if the perp just changed the overall unemployment rate , hundreds of experts would quickly find that numbers did not add up			2
the drop in the unemployment rate would not be consistent with other data in the survey			0
this would be easily detected			0
in order to successfully manipulate the data , it would be necessary to change hundreds of numbers that get reported each month			1
this would require the cooperation of dozens of top people at the @entity29			0
maybe in @entity1 's world , it is possible to go around with a big wad of money and buy off people at the drop of a hat , but the idea that someone from the @entity8 administration wandered through the top echelons of the @entity29 to buy their cooperation in fixing the unemployment numbers is absurd on its face			1
perhaps someone could be found who would be willing to be bought , but the rest would be singing their story on the national news			0
the other problem with @entity1 's charge is that he obviously has no knowledge of the unemployment series itself			1
in fact , it is common for the numbers to jump around			0
he found it incredible that the unemployment rate fell by 0.5 percentage points over two months when the economy appears to be growing slowly			0
how about when it fell by 0.7 percentage points from november 2010 to january 2011 , when growth was also very weak ? was this political manipulation of the data ? on the other side , the unemployment rate jumped by 0.2 percentage points in the summer of 1996 , when the economy was growing at a 7.1 % annual rate			1
if @entity1 knew the data at all or bothered to talk to someone who knew the data before he made his outlandish charges , he would realize that the unemployment rate is an erratic series			1
it moves around in unpredictable ways			0
i am on record as saying that friday 's drop in the unemployment rate was a statistical fluke			0
so was the 0.1 percentage point rise reported for july			0
but the economy has been adding 150,000 jobs per month , which is consistent with a declining unemployment rate			0
to get a full picture of the economy , you have to study the all the data and try to put together pieces of the puzzle			1
that may not fit @entity1 's political agenda , but that is the world we live in			1
the economists and statisticians at the @entity29 may not be the most exciting people in the world , but they are honest			0
and for that , we should be very grateful			0
when we get data from them , we know that it has not been doctored for political purposes			1

@entity1 *expanded* on his *suspicions* about jobs numbers being manipulated
@entity172 : @entity1 has no real knowledge about how statistics are assembled
@entity172 : career civil servants put numbers together based on data that tend to be erratic
