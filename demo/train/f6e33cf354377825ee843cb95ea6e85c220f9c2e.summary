@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity13 's involvement in the invasion of @entity15 " was the right decision and it was for the right reasons , " prime minister @entity3 said friday in his first response at an inquiry into country 's role in the march 2003 conflict			1
@entity3 was answering a question from the chairman of the inquiry , @entity17 , about whether he thought taking military action in march 2003 was the right decision , especially given that it led to such a great loss of life among military personnel and civilians			1
the prime minister said he respects members of the armed forces " who served with great distinction in @entity15 " and lost their lives , and to civilians who died			1
" i think any loss of life is something that makes us very sad indeed , " @entity3 said			1
the inquiry began last year and is expected to be the most thorough investigation yet into decisions that led up to the war and governed @entity13 's involvement , analysts have said			2
it is not a court of law , so the inquiry can not find anyone criminally responsible or apportion blame			0
but inquiry members will be able to judge the legality of the conflict			0
@entity3 spent much of friday defending military spending allowances , which have come under harsh scrutiny in @entity13			1
earlier witnesses have said @entity3 , as head of the @entity54 leading up to and after the @entity15 invasion , did not allow the @entity56 to spend as much as was needed			1
such cuts would have restricted the military 's ability to buy helicopters , body armor and weapons that would have subsequently been used in @entity63			2
@entity3 said as chancellor , he never ruled out a military option on the basis of cost			1
" i said that every single request that was made for [ military ] equipment had to be met , and every request was met , and at any point military commanders were able to ask for equipment that they needed , and i know of no occasion when they were turned down for it , " @entity3 testified			1
@entity76 testifies at @entity15 inquiry @entity78 , defence secretary at the time of the 2003 invasion , testified that @entity3 forced cuts that limited military spending			1
" we then had to look hard at our budget and make some rather difficult cuts in the future equipment program as a result , " @entity78 testified			0
@entity3 had faced increasing pressure to testify before @entity13 holds general elections , widely expected to be held may 6			1
his @entity90 faces a tight race with the opposition conservatives			0
@entity17 , the inquiry chairman , said committee members previously decided not to call any government ministers who are still serving in posts relevant to @entity15 , but @entity3 offered to testify			1
@entity96 announced in january that @entity3 had agreed to appear in the next two months			2
@entity97 , whose son , pvt. @entity98 , died in @entity15 in 2005 , said she does n't believe @entity3 did everything possible to equip @entity13 troops			1
" was it needed ? was it asked for ? if it was , why was it not funded ? " she said			0
" at the moment , you 've got no answers			0
it would be nice just to know the truth			0
" @entity3 has faced repeated criticism for the level of equipment for the 9,000 @entity13 troops in @entity63 , which some have said is too low			2
the prime minister has defended equipment levels and said he seeks assurances from military officers in the field that troops have the supplies they need			2
a military memo , sent in june but released in october , contained a warning from a @entity13 officer that a shortage of helicopters was putting troops at risk because they were forced to travel on the ground , increasing the chances a roadside bomb could kill them			2
the memo was written by lt. col. @entity134 , who died a month later in a roadside bombing			0
at the time , he was the highest - ranking @entity13 serviceman to die in combat since the 1982 @entity137			0
gen. @entity138 previously testified the @entity54 gave defence officials a spending target that they found hard to reach			2
" it was [ a budget for ] some of the stuff that was related to some of the longer - term equipment programs , including infantry battalions , " he testified february 1			0
" i think it included helicopter money			0
i think it included things like aircraft carriers			0
it was all big - ticket items that were being threatened			0
" defence officials made as many cuts as they could before they had to stop , @entity138 said			0
" i think we drew a line somewhere halfway down the page and said , ' if you go any further than that , you 'll probably have to look for a new set of chiefs , ' " he said			0
@entity78 and others have testified that the @entity165 's budgeting structure in 2002 , the year before the @entity15 invasion , allowed officials to save money by using and maintaining existing equipment			2
officials used the cash saved for other spending , @entity78 said			0
that spending ability changed a year later and caused big problems for the ministry , they have testified			0
" we asked for significantly more money than we eventually received " in subsequent spending programs , @entity78 said			0
@entity178 , who was permanent secretary to the @entity165 at the time of the invasion , said @entity3 did not want the ministry to have as much cash as it eventually received			2
" the @entity54 felt that we were using far too much cash , and in september 2003 , the chancellor of the day instituted a complete guillotine on our [ ability to spend ] , " he said			1
" it meant that we had to go in for a very major savings exercise in order to cope with what was effectively a billion pounds reduction in our finances			0
" @entity3 testified that military options took precedence over financial concerns			1
" there was no time from june [ 2002 ] when the @entity54 said , ' this is a better military option because it 's cheaper and less costly , ' " @entity3 said			1
" at every point i made it clear that we would support whatever option the military decided upon with the prime minister and the @entity204 , and there would be no financial barrier to us doing what was necessary to be done			1
" he also testified the @entity54 granted " every application " for equipment made by the @entity165			1
@entity3 was chancellor , or head of the @entity54 , from 1997 until 2007 when prime minister @entity76 stepped down and @entity3 took over the top post			1
@entity212 , @entity76 's former spokesman , testified in january that @entity3 was part of @entity76 's inner circle , discussing questions about the @entity15 war			1
@entity76 testified in january .			0

@entity3 served as chancellor , or head of the @entity54 , from 1997 until 2007
@entity3 : " financial concerns played no part in military *planning* for the @entity15 "
@entity3 : " i made it clear we would support whatever option the military decided upon "
the decision to go to war in @entity15 was made for the right reasons , he said
