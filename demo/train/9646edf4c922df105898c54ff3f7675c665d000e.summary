@entity124 left @entity108 to join @entity135 club @entity133 to revive his hopes following a serious knee injury , but @entity138 said the player had not returned to a high enough level to be selected			0
" i told him that we have followed him closely and admire his commitment and dedication to get to the @entity5 , " @entity138 told @entity141			0
