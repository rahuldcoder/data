-- @entity2 finance ministers are eyeing a plan that would rapidly cut @entity5 's debt mountain in the early part of the next decade in an attempt to secure @entity9 approval for an extended bailout for @entity11			1
policy makers gathering in @entity13 on tuesday are inching towards a provisional deal to pay @entity5 up to € 44bn of long - overdue aid			1
the deal would involve a political fix to reset @entity11 ' long - term debt target to after 2020			1
while the details are still under negotiation , the shape of the potential deal involves @entity5 missing its target of maximum debt of 120 per cent of gross domestic product by 2020 -- a benchmark of " debt sustainability " the @entity9 regards as sacrosanct			1
but additional debt relief measures would ensure that by 2022 @entity5 's debt would fall to less than 110 per cent of gdp			1
this compromise aims to reconcile the public spat between eurozone ministers -- who want the 120 per cent target pushed back to 2022 so that official creditors need not suffer losses on any @entity5 debt -- and the @entity9 , which is refusing to release bailout loans unless @entity11 is servicing manageable debts by 2020			1
the @entity9 can only disburse funds to countries deemed solvent			0
the @entity9 has urged @entity44 official creditors -- the eurozone rescue funds and the @entity46 -- to take losses in one form or another on their officials loans or bond holdings to help reduce @entity5 debt			2
heading into the meeting , the @entity9 remained sceptical that a comprehensive agreement was easily achievable , with the eurozone countries still privately at odds with each other about how to fill @entity5 's financing gap			1
as the meeting started , the fund was holding to its target of reducing @entity5 's debt - to - gdp ratio to 120 per cent by 2020 -- the goal which sparked a public disagreement last week between @entity65 , the @entity9 's managing director , and eurogroup president @entity67			1
fund officials have pointed to statements by the @entity70 and other mainly northern @entity44 countries making their support for any financing package conditional on the @entity9 's approval			0
@entity75 , a former @entity76 official now at the @entity78 risk consultancy , said : " the @entity9 needs to push hard on debt sustainability for its own institutional credibility			2
they 've finally understood that the @entity44 want them in the mix for political blame sharing as much as for their actual policy prescriptions			0
" @entity5 's debt burden has ballooned since the last bailout deal in march because the country 's recession has been deeper than expected and because privatisation plans have failed to get off the ground			1
@entity5 debt is now expected to peak at 190 per cent by 2014			0
furthermore , an agreement last week to extend @entity5 's bailout by two years , giving @entity11 more time to hit austerity targets , requires an additional € 15bn in financing that will further add to the country 's debt pile			1
the sharper trajectory of reducing @entity5 's ballooning debt levels would come through a combination of cutting interest rates on existing bilateral loans , extending the debt maturities , launching a debt buyback scheme and the @entity46 forgoing any profits on its holdings of @entity5 debt			2
however , many analysts -- and some @entity46 policy makers -- are sceptical about whether these measures even in combination would be sufficient to hit 120 per cent in 10 years without more generous debt forgiveness			0
most officials are optimistic that a tentative agreement will be reached on tuesday to disburse the loans under an extended bailout programme , which would be formally approved after consultation with national parliaments , according to officials involved			0
the question is whether the @entity9 will agree to pay its slice of the loans to @entity5			2
the most difficult element is likely to be bridging the divide with the @entity9 , which is insisting on firm pledges to ensure @entity5 is on a path to solvency			2
mr @entity67 said : " there are good chances that we will come to a conclusive mutual solution			0
" but others were more cautious			0
@entity130 , the @entity131 finance minister , warned that the situation was " very much open " and might not be concluded			0
@entity11 is seeking a payment of € 44bn , comprising € 31.5bn of overdue loans and tranches of credit earmarked to it to the end of the year			0

deal involves @entity5 missing its maximum debt target of 120 *%* of gdp by 2020
the @entity9 regards that benchmark of " debt sustainability " as sacrosanct
