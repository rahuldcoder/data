a new study says smoking ordinances can lead to fewer hospitalizations from heart attacks			1
researchers studied the impact of smoke - free ordinances implemented in @entity13 , @entity14 , in july 2003			1
they compared the number of hospitalizations for heart attacks 18 months before the policy went into effect and three years after implementation			2
the @entity21 found that although 399 people were hospitalized for heart attacks before any smoke - free laws went into effect , that number dropped to 237 three years after the law 's introduction , a 41 percent decline			1
the study was published in the @entity7 's @entity29 on wednesday			0
the accompanying editorial suggests that there may be several reasons the ordinance may have led to a reduction in the number of heart attack - related hospitalizations : the ordinance led to an immediate decrease in secondhand smoke exposure			1
people who were forced to comply with smoke - free rules in public may have adopted a smoke - free environment at home and thus reduced the exposure to secondhand smoke even more			0
restrictions to where you can smoke may have led more people to quit smoking altogether			0
while the @entity14 researcher did n't know if the study participants were smokers or non-smokers , the @entity7 's editorial points out that the new study adds to research from eight other studies , which also saw a drop in heart attack related hospitalizations after smoke - free laws are enforced			1
a 2006 surgeon general report concluded that " exposure of adults to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer			2
" according to the @entity71 and @entity72 , secondhand smoke is the combination of two types of smoke that is produced when burning tobacco : the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette , cigar or pipe and the smoke that is exhaled by the smoker			0
the @entity85 has classified secondhand smoke as a known human cancer - causing agent			0
according to the cancer institute , there is no safe level of secondhand smoke , and it can have an immediate effect " on a person 's heart and blood vessels			0
" it may raise the risk of heart disease by 25 to 30 percent and cause about 46,000 heart disease deaths annually , according to the @entity71 web site .			2
