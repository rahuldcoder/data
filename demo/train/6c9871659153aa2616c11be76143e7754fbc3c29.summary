-- when he came into our makeshift hotel suite studio in @entity4 , @entity1 quickly developed a mild love affair with a bowl of mixed nuts that we placed near his chair			1
and for a while he even considered keeping the snacks in his hand throughout the interview			0
" i want to just hold a bowl of nuts the entire time and not really explain it			0
" however , in the end he placed it back on the table , with a simple , " that 's dumb			2
" and , thus , we launched into a spirited conversation about what a huge dork he is			0
because , apparently , when you 're the son of a professional bowler ( for real ) you naturally develop a passion for the uncool			0
sometimes that passion leads to a lonely , sexless life spent in your parents ' basement , but , in this case , it manifested itself in the form of one of the biggest names in nerddom			0
" i just kind of one day was like , ' why am i not working around this kind of thing ? ' and it just so happened that @entity40 existed and it all fell together			2
" soon he was hosting a new show called " @entity42 , " modeled after @entity44 's show " @entity43			1
" whereas the latter concentrates on pop culture and notable television moments , @entity1 's new endeavor became a showcase for the best ( and worst ) of the @entity50			1
however , " @entity42 " perhaps was n't quite nerdy enough , so in 2010 @entity1 continued doing the show while also launching a new weekly interview podcast called " the @entity53			1
" @entity54 : i 'm dangerous to other comedians that venture eventually led to him writing a book called " the @entity60 , " in which @entity1 offers self - help advice to his people			1
the book is due out this fall -- so hopefully none of his nerd followers will create an evil world - destroying robot in the meantime			1
that would be just tragic			0
of course , to a certain generation we would be remiss if we did n't also mention that , yes , @entity1 once hosted , with @entity73 , the hit @entity75 dating show " @entity76			2

@entity1 hosts " @entity42 " on @entity40 , modeled after @entity44 's " @entity43 "
@entity1 has also launched a podcast called " @entity53 "
his book of self - help advice , " the @entity60 , " is due out this fall
