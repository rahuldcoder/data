in 2009 , @entity0 participated for the first time in the @entity3 's @entity2 , the tri-annual survey of the world 's school systems			1
and when @entity0 's teenagers proved their math , science , and reading were much better than their peers in the @entity13 , @entity14 , and @entity15 , the world was shocked and awed			1
here , much more so than the @entity16 or @entity0 's skyscrapers or @entity19 's double - digit growth , was proof positive that the future belonged to @entity19			1
the latest @entity2 results released this week show that @entity0 schools are still number one , but , as i argued after @entity0 's first placing in 2009 , the triumph comes at too great a cost			1
the dog - eat - dog and winner - take - all mentality of @entity19 's school system is n't just making children unhappy and unhealthy -- it 's also causing cheating and bribery , leading to an unfair and unequal school system			1
the teachers a tour of any @entity0 junior high school offers an easy explanation as to why @entity0 placed first on the @entity2			0
they may be crammed and overcrowded , but the halls are clean and tidy , classrooms packed with attentive and focused students , and meeting rooms filled with university - educated and highly - motivated teachers trading notes on how to better design their 45 - minute lesson			0
the incentives to succeed bind the school together , and guide it			0
teachers are paid about 10,000 yuan a month ( $ 1,640 ) , which makes them solidly middle - class in @entity0			2
in their @entity2 performance , @entity0 's students show " a high level of resilience , " which is to say that poor students do better than expected			1
that 's in large part because the @entity0 government is committed to leaving no child behind : it funds all schools equally , partners high - performing schools with low - performing ones and offers fast - track promotions to administrators who can turn around bad schools			1
in one @entity0 junior high school i visited , teachers stayed after school to tutor failing students -- and the head teacher there honored those teachers in school assemblies			2
but these teachers can drive @entity80 if their students do well enough on tests : yes , administrators can give teachers bonuses , but the real money is in grateful parents and moonlighting at for - profit cram schools ( after school tutoring programs )			0
and the head that honored teachers who tutored failing kids told me that in her experience , the best indicator of a student 's school performance is his / her socio - economic background			0
she said the tutoring of poor kids is just a bandage , a way to get them through the system and not have them drag the school down			0
the parents because @entity0 's schools are so good , @entity0 parents have to pay -- even if it 's not exorbitant tuition fees			1
@entity0 's real estate market is notoriously expensive , but it 's downright unaffordable in the neighborhoods of @entity0 's very best public elementary schools , and when families ca n't use real estate to buy into the best schools , they try to bribe their way in			1
this culture of bribing public school officials means i ca n't maintain friendships , make new ones , and date -- a girl i dated in 2010 told me she 'd give me 200,000 yuan ( $ 32,800 ) to get her sister into my school			0
and because @entity0 's elementary school classrooms have 30 or 40 students , parents trip over each other in the mad rush to take teachers out to dinner and offer gifts in the hope that their only child gets a little more attention			1
the bribery is on top of every other advantage that @entity0 's wealthy parents have bestowed upon their only child : weekend piano , math , and @entity145 classes , private tutoring , summer camp in @entity13 , vacations in @entity149 and above all a born - to - succeed attitude			1
the students for the students , the race is to see who can enter @entity0 's best two universities -- @entity156 and @entity157			1
but it 's just not the prospect of a good job that drives students on			0
scoring highly on tests in @entity0 is like scoring a lot of touchdowns in @entity165 -- it 's what wins you social respect , and soon comes to define your identity and self - worth			2
there 's substantial social science research -- popularized in books such as @entity173 -- that suggests performance - based incentives are bad for students and teachers			0
incentives do not just make students stressed , lonely , and unhappy -- they also kill student 's innate curiosity , creativity , and love of learning			0
and high - stakes testing has led to a culture of cheating in @entity19			2
last year , when authorities tried to stop cheating , a riot broke out -- parents were angry that their children were being singled out when everyone was cheating			0
the best model ? in the excitement over @entity0 's @entity2 victory we tend to forget the real lesson to be learned : how @entity197 can be the real model for education reform in the world			1
@entity197 , which ranked 12th in the 2012 math rankings , may not be number one , but , in my experience from visiting the country , it 's succeeded in equipping all @entity197 students with the tools to succeed in the knowledge economy without sacrificing their childhood , curiosity and creativity			0
after @entity0 children leave school at 4 p.m. , they go on to cram school and do homework until bedtime			0
in stark contrast , when @entity197 children leave school at noon , they just go play for the whole day			0
that @entity197 students do almost as well as their @entity0 peers on @entity2 suggest that long school days , cram schools , and homework are not really about helping students learn -- it 's more about pleasing anxious , demanding , and hyper - competitive parents			2
of course , there 's a rising tide of @entity19 parents who care more about their child 's well - being than his or her test score			2
and these wealthy and well - educated parents who understand the costs and sacrifices of @entity0 's @entity2 victory are emigrating abroad or opting for new private @entity240 - style schools that have sprung up in major @entity19 cities			1
that 's bad news for @entity19 education reform because those who are in the best position to make a stand are instead voting with their feet .			2

@entity0 schools came top in the @entity3 's *internaional* education rankings
@entity0 's triumph comes at too greater cost , argues teacher @entity254
cheating and bribery are problems at @entity19 schools , he says .
" dog - eat - dog " mentality makes *schoolchildren* unhappy and unhealthy
