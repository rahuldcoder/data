across the @entity1 , many families know firsthand how high maternity care costs are			1
as noted in the @entity4 recently , giving birth in the @entity1 is more expensive than any other country in the world			0
total costs average $ 18,329 for a vaginal delivery and $ 27,866 for a c - section , with the bulk of the bill going to insurers			0
however , families with insurance still have to pay about $ 3400 out of pocket			0
what 's ironic is we ca n't even claim that the extra expense pays off in healthier mothers and babies			0
according to a study by the @entity22 , the @entity1 ranks at or near the bottom on virtually all maternity care outcomes			1
so who 's to blame for these high costs ? partly , mothers themselves			0
@entity1 are obsessed with the notions that " newer is better " and " more technology is always a plus			1
" when it comes to medical technology , the @entity1 public becomes @entity35 , continually asking , " please , sir , i want some more			0
" i was part of a team that recently conducted a pair of national surveys of mothers			0
among the many questions , we asked if mothers agreed with the statement , " newer maternity tests and treatments are generally improvements over older ones			1
" an overwhelming majority of mothers ( 74 % ) agreed while only 10 % disagreed			0
likewise , when given the statement , " maternity tests and treatments that work the best usually cost more than those that do n't work as well , " mothers were twice as likely to agree than disagree			2
mothers were also far more likely to agree that women get too few tests during pregnancy rather than too many			0
" newer equals improvement " and " more is better than less " have long been effective marketing themes in @entity1 culture			2
but the problem is that in the case of medical technology , the results do n't consistently bear that out			0
while other countries have set up elaborate systems to assess new medical interventions for their cost effectiveness compared to existing practices before approving them , until recently that has not been a priority in @entity1 medical care			2
the result is that public infatuation with newer technologies merges smoothly with the medical industry 's desire to profit from providing more services			2
a prime example of this problem is the failure to take advantage of midwife - led birthing centers			1
these have been found in the @entity1 and overseas to be a safe and cost effective alternative to universal reliance on large hospitals			1
freestanding birthing centers ( as opposed to hospitals which refer to their maternity ward as a " birthing center " ) are usually directed by midwives and are affiliated with hospitals that serve as a referral site for transfers			1
the cost savings stem from less reliance on expensive medications and technologies , a shorter stay ( mothers typically return home within 24 hours ) and lower personnel costs			1
while the numbers of birthing centers have increased in the last decade , less than 1 in 300 @entity1 births occur in a center			1
how come ? consider who loses money if birthing centers become popular : large hospitals , pharmaceutical companies , obstetricians and anesthesiologists -- all powerful groups who believe deeply that the use of their products and services is not only a source of income , but the safest option for mothers and babies			1
the result is that an array of regulatory ( restrictive state licensing laws ) and financial barriers ( denial of insurance coverage ) combined with informal constraints ( hospital refusal to provide backup ) limit their use			0
freestanding birthing centers are n't for everyone			2
they are meant to serve women with lower risk pregnancies and there 's about a 1 in 8 chance a woman would need to be transferred to a hospital during labor			0
nonetheless , it is of concern that so many women who are interested in it are denied an option that can provide a safe and far less expensive experience for mothers and babies			0
medical technology has done wonders for our lives , especially in select , high - risk cases			0
but rising maternity care costs reflects the downside of our societal obsession with newer , bigger and shinier technology			1
the @entity1 needs to seriously rethink how we approach maternity care			1
the first question that needs to be addressed is : do more tests and reliance on the biggest , most expensive hospital settings actually improve the health of mothers and babies ? when they do , great			1
but when they do n't , we need to overcome the financial , institutional and cultural barriers to use reasonable options like birthing centers .			2

@entity183 : @entity1 maternity care costs are the highest in the world
@entity183 : partly , the problem is that @entity1 are obsessed with newer technologies
he says more tests , reliance on big hospitals do not improve health of mothers and babies
@entity183 : look to midwife - led birthing centers as a safe and cost effective alternative
