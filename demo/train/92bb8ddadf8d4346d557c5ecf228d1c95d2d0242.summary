@entity0 -- as a teenager , @entity2 lived for sports			1
she was a cyclist and a climber , and she played on her high school 's softball and field hockey teams			2
that all ended abruptly her sophomore year , the day @entity2 tore a ligament in her right knee during a field hockey game			1
she underwent acl surgery , expecting a quick recovery			0
instead , it led to 45 more operations on her knee , months in the hospital and a diagnosis of a rare genetic disorder			2
at 20 , @entity2 faced a difficult decision : continue to undergo more surgery or consider amputation			1
" i thought of what i wanted out of life			0
i was on crutches for six years			0
i had a leg that was basically dead weight , " she said			2

from a setback to an ' @entity54 ' a firefighter in @entity0 and a 10 - time @entity57 , @entity45 's own life is all about adventure			1
but like the women she helps , she , too , is a survivor			1
seven years ago , @entity45 was running in an adventure race when her leg gave out			1
she collapsed and dragged herself to the finish line			0
shortly after , she was diagnosed with stage - four osteoarthritis in both hips , and her doctor told her she would never run again			0
" i was in shock , because my body had never betrayed me before , " said @entity45 , 47			2
" i always found a way to get through whatever it was , so i pretended it was n't happening for a little while			0
and then i was being rolled into surgery for my first hip replacement			0
" @entity45 has since had three more hip replacements , but she never let it stop her			2
after the first one , she was inspired by a friend to start scheduling herself in events for which she could train			0

" maybe somebody always wanted to run a @entity89 but got cancer , and now they need the motivation to not let that dream fade , " she said			0
" it 's not about the setback , it 's about the comeback			0
" @entity37 provides grants , called " @entity98 , " that pay for coaching , travel expenses , entry fees or equipment -- whatever may be needed for a woman to live her adventure			1
" being an @entity37 , you 're not just a survivor , you 're an adventurer , " @entity45 said			1
" we give them a different label to put on themselves , and it 's something they become on their way to the finish line			0
" women can apply for a grant to do any event they wish , or they can participate in one organized by @entity37			1
the group 's events include a 45 - mile @entity122 trek and a 100 - mile kayaking , cycling and hiking / running adventure in the @entity126			2
adventure becomes them @entity45 has found that many of the women start small and then want to do more			1
" we often hear , ' what else can i do ? ' it gives them a whole new perspective , " @entity45 said			2
" it 's not about trying to get back what you were , it 's about trying to be the best of what you 're capable of today , this minute			0
" @entity2 , now 23 , credits @entity37 with helping her get her life back			1
in 2012 , she was able to participate in the group 's @entity126 adventure with the assistance of a prosthetic leg			1
" it was the most incredible feeling to be surrounded by so many like - minded people , the common bond of going through something , " @entity2 said			2
for @entity154 , helping the women gain a sense of rebirth motivates her			0
