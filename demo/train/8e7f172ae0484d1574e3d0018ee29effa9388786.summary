@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 scientists have produced clones of mice that have been dead and frozen for 16 years -- a feat that could lead researchers to one day resurrect long - extinct species , such as the mammoth			1
@entity10 was cloned using cells from live animals			0
now scientists believe they can resurrect extinct species			1
until now , scientists have only been able to produce clones using cells from live animals			1
this is how researchers created @entity10 , the first mammal to be cloned from an adult animal			0
researchers had thought that frozen cells were unusable because ice crystals would have damaged the dna			2
that belief would rule out the possibility of resurrecting extinct animals from their frozen remains			2
but the latest research -- published in the journal , proceedings for the @entity27 -- shows that scientists may have overcome the obstacle			0
researchers at the @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity1 , used cells from mice that had been frozen for 16 years at -20 @entity37 ( -4 degrees @entity38 )			1
they extracted the nucleus and injected it into eggs whose dna had been removed			0
several steps later , the scientists were able to clone the mice			0
" this is the first time a mammal has been cloned from a sample stored at conditions reasonably close to what might be expected in permafrost , " @entity44 , who led the study , said in a statement			0
" ( it ) gives some hope for those who might seek to clone extinct species from frozen carcasses			1

@entity1 scientists produce clones of mice dead and frozen for 16 years
feat could lead researchers to resurrect long - extinct species , like mammoth
researchers used cells from mice that were frozen for 16 years at -20 *celsius*
