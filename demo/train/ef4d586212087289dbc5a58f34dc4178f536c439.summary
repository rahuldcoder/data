-- the ugly specter of @entity2 in football has raised its face again after a man was arrested at an @entity7 game			1
police confirmed that a 57 - year - old man was arrested and charged on " suspicion of a racially aggravated offense " at sunday 's match between @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity12 's fanbase has a large @entity16 contingent , and they originally called themselves " @entity22 " in response to anti-semitic abuse from rival supporters , but the offense did not relate to the " y - word			1
" the club has often experienced abuse by its @entity26 rivals but this incident was unusual given the lack of animosity between @entity12 and @entity13			1
the latest incident involved anti-semitic abuse and the man , who was sitting in the visitors ' section at @entity12 's @entity35 , was reported by two @entity13 supporters to police			1
a statement from the @entity39 read : " during the @entity12 vs. @entity13 match at @entity35 on march 23 , officers in the stadium received a complaint regarding the behavior of a man sat in an area reserved for away supporters			1
" the complaint was made by two people sat in the same area of the stadium			0
" officers arrested the man , aged 57 , on suspicion of a racially aggravated offense under section five of the @entity53			1
" he was taken into custody and subsequently bailed until may 19 , pending further investigation			2
" @entity12 regards itself as being proactive in its fight against racism and told @entity0 in a statement that " anti-semitism in any form is wholly unacceptable and we support all efforts to kick it out of the game			1
" last year the @entity67 had warned football fans that they would face criminal prosecution if they continued to chant the y - word , which has been deemed anti-semitic even as a segment of @entity12 fans claim they 're using the word in defiance of @entity2			2
earlier this month , charges were dropped against three @entity12 fans who were accused of using the word " yid " while at a @entity12 game			2
the @entity81 , which monitors incidents of @entity2 in the @entity83 , has been outspoken in its fight against the problem			0
" in recent years anti-semitism in football has been an increasingly important issue , " a spokesman told @entity0			0
" cst and other @entity16 organizations have worked closely with the @entity67 and kick it out to try and deal with the problem and we will keep doing so			0
" @entity94 should have no place in football and that includes anti-semitism			0
" a spokesman for @entity13 told @entity0 : " as the @entity39 have confirmed , this is an ongoing investigation and as such we are unable to comment at this time			2
" the incident comes weeks after former @entity103 striker @entity102 was fined Â £ 80,000 ( $ 130,000 ) by the @entity67 after making the " quenelle " gesture during a match in december			0
@entity102 , who has since left the club , was widely criticized for the gesture -- -- which involves pointing a straightened arm downwards while touching the shoulder of that arm with the other hand -- after scoring against @entity113			0
the gesture , which he said was dedicated to his comedian friend @entity115 -- who uses it as part of his act -- is believed by some to be a @entity120 salute in reverse and has been linked with anti-semitism in @entity102 's homeland , @entity124			2
an @entity125 was asked to consider if the gesture was " abusive and / or indecent and / or insulting and / or improper , " and " included a reference to ethnic origin and / or race and / or religion or belief			0
" both charges were proved , said the commission , but it added it did not believe @entity102 to be anti-semitic .			0
