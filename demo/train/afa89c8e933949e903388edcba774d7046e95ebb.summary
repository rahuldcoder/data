@entity0 says she followed all the rules when caring for an @entity4 patient			1
so how did the @entity6 nurse contract the deadly virus ? " i have no idea , " she told @entity1			1
" i go through it almost daily in my mind : what happened , what went wrong			2
because i was covered completely every time			2
i followed the @entity14 protocol			1
it is a mystery to me			2
" @entity16 , who was declared @entity4 - free last week after treatment at @entity18 in @entity19 , spoke with @entity1 's @entity20 in an exclusive interview that aired thursday			1
she described her experience fighting the deadly virus and fired back at critics who said she should never have boarded commercial flights after treating an @entity4 patient			1
" i 'm a nurse			2
i care for me , i would not put myself in danger			2
first , i would not take @entity4 to my family and my best girlfriends			1
i would not endanger families across the nation , potentially exposing them to anything , " she said			0
" i had no symptoms			2
there was no way , at that time -- i could not transmit it			0
" the 29 - year - old nurse choked up thinking of the harsh reactions of some people after they learned she had @entity4			1
" it 's just not me , " she said			2
" all i do is care			0
all i want to do is help			0
i would never try to hurt anyone			0
" opinion : @entity4 will elevate respect for nurses ' i did what i was supposed to do ' shortly after @entity16 's diagnosis , @entity14 director dr. @entity52 told reporters that she should n't have taken the flights			1
" the @entity14 guidance in this setting outlines the need for what is called controlled movement			1
that can include a charter plane , a car , but it does not include public transport , " the @entity14 director told reporters at the time			1
" we will from this moment forward ensure that no other individual who is being monitored for exposure undergoes travel in any way other than controlled movement			2
" @entity16 said she felt like @entity52 blamed her without any basis			1
" i did what i was supposed to do , and now you 're saying i should not have flown , " she said			0
" you know , i checked multiple times before i even left @entity78 to see if it was ok to go			0
" and when her return flight from @entity81 to @entity78 got repeatedly delayed , @entity16 said she checked her temperature multiple times and reported it to the @entity83			1
then her contact there would speak with the @entity14			1
" she would tell me if i was ok to go or not , " @entity16 said			1
" and i got the ok every single time			0
" ' it 's a struggle ' @entity16 's diagnosis came amid a wave of national concern about the possible spread of @entity4 in the @entity91 , especially after it became known she had flown on two commercial flights after treating @entity94			1
she became the second person known to have contracted @entity4 in the @entity91 , and the second nurse from @entity98 to get the virus after caring for an @entity4 patient			1
learning that her colleague , nurse @entity101 , had contracted @entity4 was a shock , @entity16 said			1
" my heart dropped , " @entity16 said			1
" i was afraid for myself			0
my first thought was , @entity101 is a great nurse			2
she follows rules and protocol as closely as i do			2
if this happened to her , it can happen to me			0
" several days later , @entity16 was diagnosed with @entity4 after returning to @entity78 from a trip to visit family in @entity113 , where she was planning her wedding			1
days after being inside a bridal shop , she was isolated in a hospital , fending off the virus			2
it was n't an easy battle , @entity16 said			1
" it takes so much out of you			0
and even now ... walking a short distance , i get short of breath , " she said			0
there were several particularly rough days , she said			0
" you 've got to force yourself to get up , and forcing yourself takes a lot out of you , too , " she said			0
" it 's a struggle			2
you 're fighting for your life			0
" @entity133 : ' i just wanted to be there ' for @entity16 's family , it was also a harrowing ordeal			1
like television viewers across @entity91 , @entity139 stared at a tv screen and saw her daughter walking from an ambulance into the airplane that would take her from @entity78 to @entity19 for treatment			0
it was a devastating sight for @entity147 , who was quarantined in @entity78 and so could n't be with her daughter			0
" i would n't have cared if she had triple @entity4			1
wrap me up in @entity154 bags , " she said			0
" i just wanted to be there			0
because i knew in my gut that she was alone			0
" hearing remarks people made about her daughter did n't help			0
" i think they could have used the science to guide the situation , rather than make the comments they they did , " @entity147 said			0
even now , she said , " people just are n't listening			0
" " i want them to hear that my daughter is a hero , " she said			0
@entity16 's fiance , @entity171 , said the intense media spotlight has been difficult			1
" it 's not like she 's an entertainer who was looking for fame , " he said			2
" in the interview with @entity20 , he described the agony of the first days after @entity16 's diagnosis			1
he feared the worst , realizing that if @entity16 died , her remains would be discarded as hazardous waste ; there would n't even be an urn at her funeral			1
" the reality of it all just really set in , the gravity of it , " he said			0
he wondered , " can our system really handle this ? " ready to rebuild @entity16 survived the deadly virus			1
doctors ca n't say for sure exactly what saved her , though they say her young age and how quickly she received treatment were likely factors			0
going forward , @entity16 said it 's clear that more planning is necessary for @entity91 hospitals to better handle @entity4			1
" we were n't the best prepared , " she said			0
" we did not have extensive training			0
we did not have a level of feeling comfortable with putting on and taking off the protective equipment			0
we did n't have the time to practice it			0
there was not a lot of education done beforehand			0
" that , she said , is a lesson that hospitals need to take seriously			0
" everyone needs training , " @entity16 said			1
" health care providers need to feel comfortable			2
they need to feel like they 're protected so they can provide the best care			2
" @entity16 said nursing remains her passion , but she does n't know when she 'll be suiting up in scrubs again			1
" right now i have to take care of me , " she said			0
" it 's taken weeks			2
i feel like i gain a little bit of strength every day , " she said			1
" but i know me , and i 'm not at the position right now where i feel comfortable providing care			2
" for the 29 - year - old nurse , it 's also time to get her life back on track			1
after her diagnosis with @entity4 , cleanup crews destroyed her engagement ring and the wedding binder she used to plan her upcoming nuptials			1
" we 've got to rebuild , " she said			0
and if anyone else contracts @entity4 , she 's ready to step in -- this time by donating blood to help in their treatment			1
" are you going to give plasma ? " @entity20 asked her			0
" absolutely , " @entity16 said , " as soon as i am able to do so			1
" @entity1 's @entity252 and @entity253 contributed to this report .			2

" i feel like i gain a little bit of strength every day , " nurse @entity0 says
@entity16 says she followed the @entity14 's rules when caring for an @entity4 patient
she says she has " no idea " how she contracted the virus
she defends her *decision* to travel on commercial flights , saying she had no symptoms
