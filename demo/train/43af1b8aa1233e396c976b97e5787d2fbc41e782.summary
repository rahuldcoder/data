-- experts disagreed tuesday over just how bad things have gotten at the stricken @entity4 nuclear plant in northeastern @entity5 , but all of them agreed that things could get worse			1
an explosion tuesday at the plant elevated the situation there to a " serious accident , " on a level just below @entity15 , a @entity9 nuclear official said , referring to the international scale that rates the severity of such incidents and to an incident 25 years ago in what is now @entity21			1
his comments came before a fire was reported wednesday in the no. 4 reactor building at the @entity5 plant			1
the @entity26 -- or @entity26 -- ranks incidents from @entity28 , which indicates very little danger to the general population , to @entity31 , a " major accident " with a large release of radioactive material and widespread health and environmental effects			1
" it 's clear we are at @entity42 , that 's to say we 're at a level in between what happened at @entity45 and @entity15 , " @entity36 , president of @entity9 's nuclear safety authority , told reporters tuesday			1
the core meltdown at the @entity45 nuclear power plant near @entity49 , @entity50 , in 1979 caused no injuries or deaths , and only low levels of radiation were found later in plants and animals , experts said			1
at least 30 people died following the 1986 explosion and fire at @entity15 , and large swaths of @entity21 , @entity61 and @entity62 were contaminated from the nuclear fallout			1
thousands of cases of childhood thyroid cancer resulted , according to dr. @entity66 of @entity67 , which opposes the use of nuclear power			2
@entity5 nuclear authorities initially rated the incident that began last friday with a 9.0 - magnitude earthquake in northeastern @entity5 followed by a tsunami at @entity75 , according to @entity76 of the @entity77			1
level 4 is characterized as a minor release of radioactive material that necessitates only measures to control food due to contamination			0
but in the latest information about the explosion , @entity5 authorities did not give it a rating , @entity76 said , and the @entity77 did not cite one either			1
but @entity88 , president of the @entity89 and author of " @entity91 : nuclear , @entity94 , " said the level is far beyond 4			2
" we are way beyond @entity45 level and heading into @entity15 territory , " he told @entity0 in a telephone interview			0
" this is at least a 5 , probably a 6 and it could end up a 7			0
" he added , " this is not going to end well			0
at the very least , we 're going to have a very expensive mess to clean up , and the worst is that we we spread radioactive particles across hundreds or thousands of square miles of @entity5			1
" the @entity107 agreed the initial rating was low			2
" the explosion in the unit 2 reactor , the third so far , and the fire in the spent fuel pond in the reactor building for @entity116 means that this accident can no longer be viewed as a level 4 on the @entity26 scale , " the institute said tuesday in a posting on its website			2
" this event is now closer to a level 6 , and it may unfortunately reach a level 7 , " it said			0
level 6 events have broad consequences that require countermeasures to deal with the radioactive contamination			0
level 7 events would constitute a larger release of radioactive material and would require further countermeasures			0
another way to measure the incidents would be to rank them in comparison with @entity15 , deemed the worst , and @entity45			0
" my guess is this is now number two , but i need to need to look at the data more carefully , " said @entity135 , an associate in the @entity136 at the @entity137 and a @entity138			0
@entity141 , a senior scientist in the nuclear program at the @entity143 , said he would guess that the incident ranks " a little worse than @entity45 and not nearly as bad as @entity15			1
" but , he complained , he could not look at the data because they had not been made available			0
" there are too many variables : first is the lack of transparency on the part of the @entity5			1
" even if the @entity5 prove capable of keeping coolant in the three reactors that have experienced partial core meltdowns , many uncertainties remain , he said			1
one of them is whether the containment vessels will keep any molten nuclear material from entering the environment			2
" if it does pool in the bottom of the reactor , after some period of time it will probably eat through the reactor into the primary containment area which is , or should be , sealed , but may not be , " he said			0
if the containment system is breached , " you have more or less direct access to the environment			0
at that point , you expect the volatile fission products and the gaseous fission products to get out of the system			0
that would be things like @entity178 , @entity179 and @entity180			0
" given that prevailing winds were blowing out to sea and people who lived within 20 kilometers of the plant had been evacuated , @entity141 said he was sanguine about the possible outcome			0
" but you can always play the game of , what 's the worst - case situation ? and the worst case can get pretty bad			1
" whatever happens , the incident will greatly affect the calculation of probabilities associated with nuclear power risk , he said			1
the probability of a core melt had been estimated at about one chance in 10,000 reactor years of operation , he said			0
" we 've had now three core melts in 30 years in less than 500 reactors , he said , referring to @entity45 , @entity15 and now @entity5			1
" so the probability of a partial core melt is one chance in several hundred instead of one chance in 10,000			0
so , it 's not a good statistic			2
" many experts said it could be a long time before they are able to determine the incident 's impact			1
" we do n't know enough to assess the long - term or short - term effects of this , " said @entity213 , a nuclear physicist , physics professor and vice president of research at @entity217			1
@entity213 said it appears the radioactive material released had largely dissipated into the atmosphere			0
however , he added , authorities would will have to test the soil for contamination in the 20 - kilometer radius of the plant that was evacuated before anyone should be allowed to return home			2
trying to place the situation on the @entity26 scale is premature , said @entity232 , director of the @entity233 at @entity234			2
" i 've been asked to put a number on it a few times and i 've resisted , " he said			0
@entity141 said his concerns transcend nuclear power			2
" we 've watched @entity241 , the @entity243 oil spill , numerous coal mining accidents , @entity15 , @entity45 , now @entity4 , slag ponds , @entity246 ( @entity246 ) reactors giving way			0
you have got to ask yourself , how many wake - up calls do you need before you get serious about building a safe , renewable - energy economy ? " @entity0 's @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 and @entity255 contributed to this report			1

nuclear physicist : " we do n't know enough to assess the long - term or short - term effects "
the @entity77 is not rating the latest incident in @entity5 on the international scale
some experts say there 's too little information to determine long - term effects
