defense secretary @entity0 announced saturday that " most [ @entity2 ] civilians placed on emergency furlough during the government shutdown will be asked to return to work beginning next week			1
" under secretary of defense @entity5 said close to 90 % of the 350,000 members of the civilian workforce will be called back			1
" my guess is that we will bring most of them back and no more than a few tens of thousands will remain on furlough			2
and it may be substantially less than that , " said @entity5			0
the ongoing government shutdown left more than 800,000 workers furloughed since tuesday			1
@entity16 promised @entity18 victory in shutdown fight @entity20 said @entity2 and @entity22 ( @entity22 ) attorneys concluded that the law allows the @entity2 to eliminate furloughs for employees whose responsibilities contribute to the morale , well - being , capabilities and readiness of service members			1
" we immediately began working with the @entity22 on how to implement it , " said @entity5 , " and the @entity2 expressed the opinion that the law does not permit a blanket recall of all @entity2 civilians			1
the @entity22 did say that we could undertake a careful review of civilians who support members of the armed forces and determine who to recall			2
needless to say , this is a difficult process and a very time consuming one			0
" @entity5 said officials established a series of categories for civilians who will return to work and those who will not			0
the first group to return will be " accepted civilians , the ones that are working right now connected to military operations and the safety of life and property			0
" @entity57 blames @entity58 for ongoing shutdown " we will recall a category of civilians who provide ongoing support to military members on an ongoing basis like health care , family programs , training and maintenance and commissaries			2
we will also recall a second category of civilians whose work , if interrupted by a lapse for a substantial period , could cause future problems for military members			0
falling in this category is acquisitions , program oversight , contract logistics , financial management , supply chain management , " said @entity5			0
the group that will not be recalled from furlough includes staff who are " less directly related to military members , " said @entity5			0
those that will not be recalled include some of the information staff , some of the legislative and public affairs staff , the deputy chief management officer staff , auditors and staff working in @entity98 activities			0
@entity99 passes measure to bring military chaplains back to work " because of the letter of the law and the advice from the @entity22 we had to identify those with the less direct effect on military members , " said @entity5			1
just hours before the announcement , the @entity99 passed a bill providing back pay to federal workers who were furloughed			1
it 's unclear when the @entity115 might vote on the bill			2
on friday , the @entity99 said the president would sign such a measure			1
speaker @entity58 and @entity119 leadership held the vote as part of a strategy to pass piecemeal spending legislation that addresses the issues brought up by the shutdown			0
although @entity126 oppose the incremental approach , saying it amounts to conservatives choosing to fund programs and services they like , the bill passed with strong bipartisan support			2
retroactive pay is provided under the bill , but federal workers ca n't expect paychecks until after the government shutdown ends and @entity137 reaches a resolution on the budget			1
@entity20 's announcement guarantees that many of the @entity2 workers no longer have to wait on @entity137 in order to go back to work			1
shutdown sidelines @entity148 @entity147 cadets			0

@entity20 : " i expect us to be able to significantly reduce **--** but not eliminate **--** civilian furloughs "
@entity2 and @entity22 lawyers *consulted* on *decision* , @entity20 says
hours earlier , @entity99 passed bill to *restore* back pay to furloughed workers
@entity57 has signaled he would sign such a back - pay measure
