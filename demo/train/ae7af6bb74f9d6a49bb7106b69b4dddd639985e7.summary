-- how are the elements of the charming , traditional romantic comedy " @entity2 " like the checklist of a charming , traditional bride ? let me count the ways ... @entity7 wonders if marrying his boss , @entity8 , is a good thing in " @entity2			1
" something old : the story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square , in the tradition of rom - coms from the 1940s and ' 50s			2
or is it straight out of @entity23 's 1590s ? @entity8 is the shrew , @entity25 , a pitiless , high - powered @entity27 book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout ( thus you know she needs to get ... loved )			1
@entity7 is @entity31 , her put - upon foil of an executive assistant , a younger man who accepts abuse as a media - industry hazing ritual			2
and there the two would remain , locked in mutual disdain , except for @entity25 's fatal flaw -- she 's @entity40			2
( so is " @entity42 's " @entity41 ; i thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice			2
) @entity25 , with her visa expired , faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry @entity31 in a green - card wedding			0
it 's an offer the underling ca n't refuse if he wants to keep his job			0
( a sexual - harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie 's mood			1
) ok , he says			0
but first comes a visit to the groom - to - be 's family in @entity63			1
something new : the chemical energy between @entity8 and @entity7 is fresh and irresistible			0
in her mid- 40s , @entity8 has finessed her dewy @entity8 comedy skills to a mature , pearly texture ; she 's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos , and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe			1
@entity7 , meanwhile , is just refining his dry comedy thing , learning to get the most from his deceptive cute - face looks			1
who knew these two would , hmmm , complete each other ? working together , both are surer and more disciplined in delivering their comedy goods			0
@entity80 has " plenty of laughs " something borrowed : the boisterous family dynamics			0
the eccentric supporting players ( none more extreme than @entity87 from " @entity88 " )			0
the snappy screwball dialogue in @entity91 's script			1
and the way @entity93 directs like a camp counselor wrangling bunkmates ... it 's all been seen before			0
something blue : as the wise and saucy matriarch of the family , the divine 87 - year - old @entity98 has fun as one hot grandma -- and inspires her younger stars to say " i do , " too			0
