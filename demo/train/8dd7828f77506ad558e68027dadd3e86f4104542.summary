-- twenty years ago , i was standing next to a teleprompter operator in the cavernous @entity3 in downtown @entity4			0
presidential candidate @entity5 was addressing the @entity6 , and i was guiding the teleprompter operator through his prepared text			1
drafted during an all - nighter -- one of many we 'd pull during his campaign and presidency -- the speech presented his economic program in exhaustive detail			0
but , after ad - libbing lines from the beginning , @entity5 extemporized an exhaustive explanation of @entity20 apprenticeship programs for skilled workers in manufacturing			1
by the time @entity5 concluded his tutorial on job training programs , the teleprompter operator asked me where to start scrolling the remainder of the prepared text			1
" do n't worry , " i told him			0
" @entity5 will do just fine			1
" analysis : @entity5 speech hit @entity32 's marks in his speech at the @entity34 last night , @entity5 still did just fine , just as he 's done in so many speeches where he 's treated his prepared text the way jazz greats soar from the sheet music			1
by one account , the former president spoke for 48 minutes and 5,895 words , while his prepared text , which had been distributed beforehand to the media , was only 3,136 words			0
no wonder , when asked about her husband 's speech , secretary of state @entity49 said she was looking forward to comparing the " as prepared " and " as delivered " texts			0
reviewing each version , it 's clear that the same person wrote both -- the same president who improvised 20 % of his first @entity57 address and explained his health - care plan from memory to a joint session of @entity61 after the teleprompter displayed the text of an earlier speech			0
@entity5 's improvisations are instructive because they show how the nation 's most popular political figure ( 69 % approval rating , according to a @entity71 / @entity70 poll ) still serves as extemporizer - in - chief			1
while most speakers ad - lib anecdotes , @entity5 also explains complex issues off - the - cuff			1
a sampler of @entity5 's improvisations : @entity78 : when @entity5 zapped @entity85 vice presidential nominee @entity84 on @entity87 spending reductions , " it takes some brass to attack a guy for doing what you did , " that line was n't even in the prepared text			1
bashing @entity90 : in @entity95 's @entity94 , @entity92 's funeral oration for the slain statesman skewers his rival by saying simply that @entity90 is an " honorable " man			0
in improvised remarks , @entity5 uses the same time - honored technique , describing the @entity85 : " they convinced me they were honorable people who believe what they 've said , and they 're going to keep every commitment they 've made			1
we 've just got to make sure the @entity106 people know what those commitments are			0
" improvised uplift : @entity5 also effortlessly extemporized eloquent sayings that other public figures and their staffs might write and revise for several drafts : " democracy does not have to be a blood sport			1
" and " so far , every single person who has bet against @entity106 has lost money			0
" opinion : @entity5 brings it for @entity32 public policy professor : if you think the auto mileage standards are complex , listen up : " no matter what the price [ of gas ] is , if you double the mileage of your car , your bill will be half of what it would have been			1
" softening the blow : @entity5 's conversational tone makes it easier for him to persuade undecided voters			1
as did @entity135 , @entity5 introduced his arguments with folksy asides			2
before criticizing today 's @entity85 , @entity5 began by ad - libbing : " now , there 's something i 've noticed lately , you probably have , too			2
" historian - in - chief : concluding his speech , @entity5 reminded his audience that @entity106 -- and , by inference , its presidents -- have displayed remarkable resilience			2
departing from his prepared text , @entity5 added this anecdote about the first president : " people have predicted our demise ever since @entity153 was criticized for being a mediocre surveyor with a bad set of wooden , false teeth			2
" as president , @entity5 would refer to most of his formal remarks not as speeches but as " talks , " subtly reminding his staff that he wanted to address @entity106 as adults to be persuaded , not an audience to be manipulated			2
by improvising so often , and using so few freeze - dried and focus - grouped applause lines , @entity5 continues to keep his speeches fresh , friendly and factual in the hope that his listeners will open their minds to what he says			2
yes , the @entity170 has made more farewell tours than @entity172			0
as with @entity172 , he does it his way			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

@entity177 : @entity5 often speaks without *relying* on a teleprompter
he says @entity5 has the ability to come up with memorable phrases on the fly
@entity185 : in @entity34 talk , he played the role of public policy prof but used *accessible* language
