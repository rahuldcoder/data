-- the chairman of the @entity2 is expected monday to visit a @entity4 power plant surrounded by @entity6 floodwater			1
the @entity7 , about 20 miles north of @entity8 , @entity4 , is one of two in the state that has been getting increased attention from the @entity2 amid historic flooding along the @entity6			1
the @entity7 plant , which has been shut down since april for refueling , has as much as two feet of water in places			1
the plant 's parking lot is among the areas flooded , requiring plant workers to navigate a catwalk to reach the plant			2
the other plant , @entity25 , sits on higher ground and continues to operate			2
@entity2 chairman @entity27 is scheduled to visit the @entity7 plant on monday morning			1
although an inflatable water - filled structure called an aqua berm surrounding the plant was punctured by machinery early sunday morning , key areas of the facility are not in danger of being flooded , the @entity2 and the owner of the @entity7 plant said			1
" the plant is still protected			2
this was an additional , a secondary , level of protection that we had put up , " said @entity38 , a spokesman for the @entity39			0
" the plant remains protected to the level it would have been if the aqua berm had not been added			1
" plant workers briefly switched to diesel backup generators to keep nuclear fuel at the site cool because water had gotten too close to electrical transformers , @entity48 , a spokesman for the utility , said monday			1
the plant was again drawing power from the electrical grid , he said			1
in addition to the berm , authorities have put in place floodgates , sandbags and other barriers to help protect the facility			2
as precautions , workers have been given satellite phones and extra food is stockpiled at the plant according to the @entity2			2
plant managers also have brought in additional diesel fuel should the site lose electricity , according to the @entity2			0
the aqua berm -- an 8 - foot - tall , water - filled berm , 16 feet wide at its base -- surrounded the reactor containment structure and auxiliary buildings , according to the @entity2			1
a representative of the manufacturer is at the plant helping assess whether the berm can be repaired , @entity48 said			1
with or without the berm , the chances of floodwater getting into the building where the core is kept are almost zero , said @entity87 , with the @entity88			0
the plant is designed to withstand water up to 1,014 feet above mean sea level , according to the @entity39			2
the river currently stands at 1,006.3 feet and is not expected to exceed 1,008 feet , the @entity39 said			0
" we built the plant up high enough based on history , based on the flooding in the past			0
if the flood would rise for some reason above that level we have taken precautions , again , per our procedures to sandbag the important equipment for the reactors , " @entity87 said			0
it was catastrophic flooding from @entity107 's march 11 tsunami that knocked out cooling systems at the @entity110 nuclear power plant , resulting in three reactors melting down and producing the worst nuclear disaster since @entity113			1
this year 's @entity115 flooding has also led to a spate of rumors about the @entity7 plant that @entity39 and the @entity2 have been trying to knock down			1
the utility has set up a " flood rumor control " page to reassure the public that there has been no release of radioactivity from the plant			0
an electrical fire june 7 did knock out cooling to its spent fuel storage pool for about 90 minutes , but the coolant water did not reach a boiling point before backup pumps went into service , it has said			0
heavy rainfall in @entity134 and @entity135 , combined with melting snow from the @entity137 , have sent the @entity6 surging downstream this summer			0
the river washed over and punched through levees in northwestern @entity6 , spurring authorities to urge about 250 nearby residents to leave their homes			0
the 6 to 12 inches of rainfall in the upper @entity6 basin in the past few weeks is nearly a normal year 's worth , and runoff from the mountain snowpack is 140 % of normal , according to forecasters			0
the @entity6 is forecast to remain at record or near - record levels from south of @entity8 all the way to @entity151 , @entity152 , into next week			0
the flooding is affecting communities in @entity4 , @entity152 and @entity6			2
@entity0 's @entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report .			0
