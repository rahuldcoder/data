-- there are " a lot of scare tactics in play here , " @entity1 , protagonist of the new anti-hydraulic - fracturing film " @entity3 , " warns a local politician skeptical of the benefits of hydraulic fracturing			1
played by @entity12 , @entity11 is an earnest salesman for the energy giant @entity14 , bent on convincing a rural town in @entity16 that hydraulic fracturing will save its outdated agrarian economy from collapse			2
at first glance , @entity1 seems like a savior to the town , promising poor , unemployed farmers an economic renaissance			0
but he quickly becomes a villain -- a henchman of the big , bad corporation out to exploit the destitute and uninformed through bribes and get - rich - quick promises			0
that is , until a wizened old man ( representing the film 's voice of justice ) stands up to @entity1 at a town meeting and exposes the alleged dangers of hydraulic fracturing that @entity1 was covering up			1
the town , taken aback , puts its hydraulic fracturing decision up for vote			0
@entity1 feels confident in his ability to persuade the town until an anti-fracking environmentalist named @entity41 appears on the scene			0
@entity41 is @entity43 taking on @entity44 , saying he wants to stop @entity11 because @entity14 's fracking allegedly destroyed his family 's longstanding farm with water contamination			2
with charm and wit , @entity41 wins over the town and leaves @entity1 at the point of despair			0
but then the film takes an unexpected twist			0
i wo n't give away the film 's ending , except to say that its anti-fracking message relies predominantly on -- to use @entity11 's own words -- scare tactics			1
never once does the audience see hydraulic fracturing in action or even a well or the controversial wastewater			0
" @entity3 " lacks any substantive scientific evidence illustrating the alleged dangers of fracking			1
@entity68 : @entity71 movies can ( mis ) educate us instead , the film falls back on many conventional anti-capitalist themes			2
the " only reason you 're here is ' cause we 're poor , " declares a farmer to @entity11 at one point			0
of course , what the film does not explain is the incredible economic revolution that hydraulic fracturing has already brought to much of @entity84			1
from 2008 to 2011 , natural gas production in the @entity84 has risen a staggering 10 % , according to a recent report from the @entity87			2
the @entity88 predicts @entity84 natural gas production will increase 44 % by 2040 , thanks in large part to increased shale gas production made available by hydraulic fracturing			2
the energy boom is bringing jobs and increased tax revenues back to rural @entity84 and not just to the pockets of big energy companies , as @entity12 and his co-writers would have you believe			1
inflation - adjusted income in @entity84 's rural areas is up 3.8 % per person since 2007 , while it has declined in urban areas			1
the unemployment rate in @entity104 , home of much of the @entity106 shale reserves , is a stunningly low 3.1 %			0
and contrary to @entity12 and company 's screed , it 's not all about the money			1
many states , such as @entity112 and @entity113 , use the tax revenues from oil and gas to fund state education projects , health care obligations and rainy - day funds			0
as to the controversy surrounding the environmental safety of hydraulic fracturing , " @entity3 " offers little credible , scientific evidence to illustrate the alleged dangers of hydraulic fracturing			1
it 's worth noting -- because " @entity3 " does not -- the head of the @entity128 , @entity129 , is on record as saying , " in no case have we made a definitive determination that the fracking process has caused chemicals to enter ground water			1
" furthermore , @entity137 said in february , " ( fracking technology ) is perfectly capable of being clean			2
it requires smart regulation , smart rules of the road			0
" a monumental energy revolution is under way in this country			0
and while industry leaders and politicians are debating the best way to effectively and safely bring the benefits of this revolution to millions of @entity84 , @entity12 and his colleagues instead aim to frighten the potential benefactors of this revolution			1
clearly we can not take this energy revolution for granted			0
" @entity3 " will not be the last of its kind			2
the public deserves to know the truth about @entity84 's energy potential			1
by freeing up more state and federal lands for drilling , cutting unnecessary , burdensome restrictions while protecting wells and ground water with safe and smart regulations , every @entity84 might soon get his own slice of the real promised land			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			0

@entity171 : the new @entity12 movie " @entity3 " tells anti-fracking tale
he says film 's message relies on scare tactics and anti-capitalist theme , offers little support
he says fracking bringing @entity84 economic boon ; even @entity128 chief says it can be clean process
@entity171 : freeing public land for well - regulated drilling will benefit @entity84
