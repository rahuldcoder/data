-- the @entity1 , hurricane-wise , has been relatively quiet this season			1
but not the northeastern @entity4			1
on saturday , the 12th storm so far this summer and fall grew to hurricane status -- not threatening anything on land yet , though it would certainly be understandable if folks on the @entity11 coast with fresh memories of @entity13 are a little spooked			1
as of 2 p.m. ( 5 p.m. et ) , @entity14 was centered well offshore about 460 miles west - southwest of the southern tip of @entity16 , according to the @entity17			1
it boasted 75 mph sustained winds , an uptick from earlier , as it churned north - northwest at an 8 mph clip			1
it is expected to continue in this direction , and get a little slower , through sunday , though " little motion " is expected come monday			0
there are no coastal watches or warnings in effect			2
and there may not be any to come , given it 's far from land and has fairly limited movement			2
the hurricane center 's discussion notes that @entity39 " does not have much time to strengthen further , given that it will be moving over gradually cooler waters and into a drier and more stable environment during the next day or so			2
" the forecast called for the storm to weaken by sunday afternoon			0
still , even a hint of potential tropical trouble might cause headaches in the region			0
while the northwest @entity1 and @entity46 have only have had four hurricanes -- @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 -- this summer and fall , the northeast @entity4 has been a different story			1
the region 's most recent big hit came compliments of @entity13			0
less than two weeks ago , @entity56 snapped palm trees , washed out roads , trashed outdoor markets and damaged facilities , including the @entity62 airport			0
many tourists found themselves stranded in popular @entity16 resorts , unable to get anywhere because of the storm .			0

@entity39 strengthens into a hurricane , centered 460 miles off @entity11 's coast
there are no *current* coastal warnings , as the storm spins north - northwest
