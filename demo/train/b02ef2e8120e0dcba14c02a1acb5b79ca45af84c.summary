-- formula one world championship leader @entity1 has warned his @entity4 team they must improve if he is to win the marque 's first drivers ' crown since 2007			1
@entity1 finished third at the @entity8 , extending his lead at the top of the 2012 standings to 29 points with just six races of the season to go			1

" in the end it went well , but we definitely ca n't go on like this , " the @entity20 , who saw his nearest rival @entity22 of @entity23 take the checkered flag , told @entity4 's official website			1
" it ca n't always be the case that my closest rival retires , as has happened in the last two races and we ca n't think of carrying on to the end of the season with qualifying sessions like yesterday 's , when our performance was almost a second off the best			0
" on track we manage to make the most of what we have , making few or no mistakes , thanks to great work from the team ; for that alone we deserve to be where we are in the classification			0
" @entity1 , who qualified fifth fastest in @entity45 , predicts tougher challenges ahead when the @entity48 season continues at similar @entity50 tracks			2
" probably this has been the most difficult circuit for us : we will find partially similar characteristics in @entity53 and @entity54 , but i hope that by the time we get there , we will have found a way of improving the car			0
" it was a very tough race physically , definitely the most tiring of the whole season ; three hundred odd kilometers in this heat and such high humidity is very stressful			0
" @entity22 , the world champion in each of the last two seasons , has moved into second place in the championship standings , ahead of @entity67 ' @entity66 in third position			0
