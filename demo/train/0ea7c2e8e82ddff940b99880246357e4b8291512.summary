@entity1 , @entity0 -- for the first time , and for a limited period only , people in @entity4 will be able to get their hands on the @entity8 , @entity11 professor @entity10 's rugged little laptop that 's designed specifically for children			1
children in @entity14 using @entity8 computers			1
the @entity8 was designed for children in developing countries			1
and for each cutting - edge @entity8 purchased in the @entity19 , another will be given to a child in a developing country			1
the " @entity23 " scheme , which launches monday , is part of the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) project to equip the world 's poorest children with a learning tool			1
for $ 399 , customers can order a laptop for themselves ; bundled into the price is the cost of delivering a second @entity8 to a child a poor country			1
the laptops , which went into high - volume production on 6 november , go on sale online at 6 a.m. eastern time monday until november 26			2
founder of @entity25 , @entity11 professor @entity10 told @entity2 that the launch of the scheme was exhilarating			1
" it must be like a runner 's high , " he said			0
" a lot of muscles hurt			0
many people thought we would not get to the finish line			2
" @entity10 is convinced that providing children in poor countries with computers is a cost - effective and empowering route into self - learning			1
in january 2005 , he unveiled @entity25 , with the aim of building a $ 100 laptop and supplying it in bulk to developing countries			1
@entity25 has come under fire from some quarters for failing to make the laptop as cheap as promised , and some , including @entity63 ceo @entity62 , have dismissed @entity10 's $ 100 aim as unrealistic			1
but while the cost of the laptops is currently around the $ 180 mark , @entity10 remains determined that his $ 100 machine is attainable once mass production kicks in			1
the rugged , green - and - white @entity8 is made by @entity71 company @entity70 , the world 's largest laptop manufacturer and maker of laptops for @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity63 amongst others			1
@entity70 will build 40,000 units in the first month , then ramp up production to 80,000 in december and 120,000 in january			0
the @entity8 uses open - source software and has long battery life , a built - in camera , mesh networking and a simple user interface			1
it features a screen that 's clearly visible even in bright sunlight , uses a tenth of the power of a conventional laptop and can be recharged by hand when mains electricity is n't available			0
while the laptop was designed to appeal to children , with its tough exterior , bright colors , touchpad and cute bunny - ear antennae , @entity10 told @entity2 that expressions of interest in the @entity8 have so far come from a wide range of potential buyers -- and geek blogs are buzzing with anticipation of its release			1
some have questioned whether laptops are the answer to the developing world 's problems			0
but in countries where education is patchy in quality and provision , @entity10 sees the computer as an educational lifeline that could open up opportunities for children to learn independently			2
" it is a window of hope , " he says			0
" education is at the root of eliminating poverty			0
" @entity10 has admitted that firm orders from developing countries have not always followed their verbal expressions of interest			2
" i have to some degree underestimated the difference between shaking the hand of a head of state and having a check written , " he told the @entity129 in september			0
" and yes , it has been a disappointment			0
" but @entity10 hopes that the @entity23 scheme will kick - start more bulk orders for his little green machines			1
" it is like an avalanche , " he told @entity2			0
" not much snow needs to slide before a huge avalanche is created			0
we hope @entity23 will be like the first pieces of snow			0
" it 's the @entity23 link between a child in @entity4 and a child in a developing country that @entity10 hopes will sway people to purchase an xo			1
" in the @entity23 program , the likely recipient in the developed world is a child , " he explained			0
" for that child to be using the same laptop as a kid in @entity156 is especially meaningful			2
" customers wanting their xos for the holiday season have been advised to order early : the first 20,000 units should be delivered by @entity160 , with their partner computers heading to @entity162 and @entity163			0
later orders will follow in 2008			0
and @entity10 's message to those considering it as a gift this year ? " do n't hesitate			2
do n't buy it because it is an inexpensive laptop , " he told @entity2			2
" buy it to join a movement to change the world			0
" ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... are you putting in an order for an xo ? can laptops fill the education gap in developing countries ? share your thoughts and read others ' views in the just imagine forum			0
