-- some @entity2 writers used to like @entity3			1
choosing their words carefully , they might say they tolerated him			0
those who churned out hugely popular soaps and television shows thought @entity2 's president , in his mid- 30s when he took power in 2000 , wanted to be known as a modern leader who defended free expression			1
some said @entity3 even looked the other way when a sketch comedy show aired for several seasons that made fun of corruption in @entity2			1
at worst , many reasoned , the young president would n't be anymore hard - line than his father , @entity19 , who had long kept a purple - knuckle grip on all media in @entity2			0
in hindsight it seems @entity3 was the greatest actor of them all , suggested @entity26 during a recent phone interview from his @entity29 apartment			1
it was dusk when he picked up the phone			0
the screenwriter and novelist , one of the most famous writers in @entity2 , usually spends this time of day writing			2
but lately he said he 's had trouble concentrating			2
now he finds himself looking out to the street , watching people gather for demonstrations			2
their loud demands fill the night			2
" it is a completely different world than a year ago , " he said			0
" people at night do not sleep			1
" @entity26 's career hit a stride at the same time @entity3 took power			1
he remembers all the talk of change from @entity2 's new leader in the early 2000s , just as the proliferation of satellite television throughout the region suddenly gave @entity2 access to different entertainment and points of view			2
demand for new shows skyrocketed			0
more manuscripts than ever were flooding into @entity3 's so - called censorship committee ( it never had a formal name )			1
@entity64 , to creative optimists such as @entity26 , was the new frontier , a democratic movement not even the regime could stop			1
@entity26 had known since he was a kid that he wanted to be a writer			1
his parents , olive tree farmers in @entity73 , said he should do something else			0
they talked about law , so he went to law school			0
but could he be a lawyer ? " i was either going to become a writer or commit suicide , " he told @entity0			0
with his natural flair for drama , he got a gig writing for tv to support his passion for fiction			2
to his surprise , he liked the industry			0
and it liked him back			0
@entity26 became one of the most sought after dramatic television writers of his generation , a @entity2 @entity91			1
in 2006 , after toiling for 13 years , @entity26 published " in praise of @entity93 , " a @entity95 novel that tells the story of an @entity73 family surviving against the backdrop of the real - life 1980s bloodbath between @entity2 's military and @entity103 militants in the city of @entity105			1
critics hailed it as a classic , praising its intricate and colorful storyline			0
they lauded @entity26 's particularly deft ability to narrate in the voice of a young girl			1
the book was nominated for the @entity114 , known as the " @entity116 " prize			0
@entity118 's regime promptly banned " in praise of @entity93			1
" from fiction to @entity121 @entity2 artists give an oh - well shrug to censorship because it 's just part of life in the country , @entity26 said , so he did the same			1
a poetry and fiction magazine he worked on for years had been banned , and government censors frequently tore his television scripts to bits			2
he coped , usually with humor			0
he laughs about smuggling his books across the @entity135 border and giving a moody but curious guard a copy			0
booksellers sold " in praise of @entity93 " by reportedly switching the book 's jacket with another			1
but @entity26 finds very little funny anymore			1
the violence marring @entity2 for more than a year has left him sad and furious , he said			0
so the writer is doing what few established artists still living in @entity2 are , especially those who made their professional mint " working " with the regime to produce television shows			1
he is aligning himself publicly with the opposition			2
now rather than devoting his days entirely to fiction , the novelist is writing on his @entity121 page , constantly posting notes of encouragement to the opposition			2
he posted march 15 , the anniversary of the start of the @entity2 uprising : " on the occasion of the birth of the revolution , can we all remove from our dictionaries words that reference sectarianism -- @entity166 -- @entity167 -- @entity168 -- @entity169 -- and avoid speaking about weapons			0
... " on @entity172 , march 8 , he posted : " on this day there is no woman besides the mother of the martyr , the sister of the martyr , and the daughter of the martyr , and all the fighters of this great revolution			0
" @entity26 told @entity0 , " i want to be close to my people , supportive of them and the revolution			1
" @entity185 choice for @entity2 artists @entity26 's recent outspokenness shows how artists have survived for years under artistic oppression in @entity2 , said @entity190 , an anthropologist who lived in @entity2 off and on until 2010			1
she studied pop culture and media there and befriended actors and writers such as @entity26			1
@entity2 artists have always faced a stark choice , she says			2
" they can choose exile , which is often unfeasible and of no benefit to the country , " she said			0
" or they can compromise , an option that can lead to an ultimate good if it enables them to convey subversive or critical messages , however muted			0
" @entity26 's comments may put him in danger , @entity190 said , noting several reports have been published about the @entity2 authorities monitoring dissidents ' phone and internet activity			1
it 's possible , she said , that @entity26 's fame has inoculated him from arrest or other harm			1
whatever might be keeping him safe , @entity26 is n't going to stop supporting what he calls " the revolution , " even as violence bears down on his city			1
increased violence in @entity29 , marked by recent twin car bombings that killed at least 27 people and clashes between the military and rebels , portend a dark future for the capital , he said			1
the fighting has all but stamped out any hope that @entity29 could fulfill its potential as an international arts haven , as many predicted a few years ago			1
in the late 2000s and even as protests against @entity3 's regime began , blogs and mainstream news organizations raved about @entity29 as the @entity239 world 's nerve center for contemporary art. foreign capital was flowing into @entity2 , which prompted a startling push toward modernity in the capital -- at least on the surface			1
high - end galleries and boutique hotels opened			0
glossy magazines such as @entity249 wrote breathlessly about @entity2 's first lady , @entity250			2
@entity29 ' new opera house was the rage			2
@entity254 @entity253 lauded the opening of a new media gallery that sponsored the first international video arts festival in the country			0
the @entity259 reported @entity2 's art scene might be the @entity261 , quoting a @entity263 travel agent scoping out @entity29 so she could entice rich collectors to go on a buying tour			1
the buzz was n't all highbrow			0
even @entity269 hip - hop songs shouted out to @entity29 a few years ago			2
@entity270 and @entity271 told everyone the party was there			0
a story for the past and future pop culture in @entity2 was driven largely by tv shows for which @entity26 wrote -- melodramas that kept viewers tuning in daily			2
@entity26 and his tv colleagues became so confident that they could push boundaries with @entity3 that they would send in fake scripts with scenes that would never make it past censors			1
" we saw it as a game between us and the regime ; one time we won , one time we lost , " @entity26 recalled			1
" sometimes we would intentionally add a scene in a script that we knew would not pass			0
but we just did it to make a point			0
" the ardor of this ostensible openness informs @entity298 's " in praise of @entity93			1
" he set the story against the backdrop of @entity2 politics and violence in the 1980s , knowing full well it would irk censors			0
many younger readers , including those protesting for a freer @entity2 , have told him they are reading his book and re-examining his contemporaries ' writing to learn about the country 's past violence			2
" many of the youth do not know the details of what happened in the ' 80s so they are going back and reading ... , " he said			0
" they are feeling really angry that the same cycle is happening all over again			0
" " in praise of @entity93 " has been translated into several languages , but for the first time , it 's about to be published in @entity323			1
@entity26 said he is excited about this translation and hopes it will help more people understand the nuances of his country			1
he wants the world to see what he has seen and to know @entity2 is more than a nightly news story of blood and despair			0
he is quiet when asked if he would ever leave @entity29			2
the question is absurd to him			0
he would never abandon @entity2 , he said , even if it meant greater personal safety and more artistic freedom			2
" if i had the choice to remain silent in @entity2 or leave and speak my mind , i would choose to remain silent and stay here , " he said			0
" i feel that i need to remain close to my people and to the revolution and speak of what i believe			0
" @entity0 's @entity343 contributed to this report .			0

when @entity3 took power , writers thought he might allow them more freedom
unlike most artists of his generation , @entity26 has voiced support for opposition
@entity118 's regime banned @entity26 's epic novel " in praise of @entity93 "
" people at night do not sleep , " @entity26 says , describing how @entity29 has changed
