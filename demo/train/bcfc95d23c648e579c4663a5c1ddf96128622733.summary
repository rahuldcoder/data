-- the current rift between @entity2 and the @entity4 administration over the terms of a cease - fire in @entity7 is empowering hard - liners in the @entity2 government and in @entity11 who do n't want to end the fighting			1
in recent days , the @entity2 media has been full of personal attacks on @entity16 secretary of state @entity15 over a draft cease - fire document he transmitted last weekend			1
the @entity18 says what it sent was a " clearly labeled confidential draft of ideas , sent in order to get @entity2 comments , as part of an effort closely coordinated with the @entity2 to explore a possible basis for a cease - fire			1
" it was never intended to be an outright proposal demanding a yes or no answer from @entity2			2
so administration officials were understandably shocked when prime minister @entity32 convened an emergency meeting of his @entity34 , which voted unanimously to reject the document -- and it was quickly leaked to the @entity2 media , promoting a firestorm of invective against @entity15			1
although we do n't know , and probably will never know , who leaked this confidential document , it is clear that this dispute serves the interests of those within the @entity2 cabinet who want to expand the military operation , possibly to encompass a temporary reoccupation of all of @entity7 so @entity2 can destroy the @entity11 military infrastructure and kill or capture its leaders and as many of its fighters as possible			1
foreign minister @entity51 is among those advocating that @entity2 " go all the way " by reoccupying all of @entity7			1
some former generals are supporting him			0
but prime minister @entity32 and defense minister @entity55 oppose this idea , which some analysts believe could take several months and cost hundreds of @entity2 and thousands of @entity59 lives with no certainty of ultimate success			2
still , in recent days , @entity32 and other @entity2 leaders have started speaking of demilitarizing @entity11 as one of their demands to end the fighting			1
@entity15 and president @entity4 have endorsed this idea as a long - term goal			2
but in the short - term , it is impractical without totally defeating @entity11 -- and that 's not going to happen			2
the rift between the @entity4 administration and the @entity2 government must be healed as soon as possible to prevent this war from escalating even further			1
@entity2 has the right to demolish the tunnels it has discovered that lead under the @entity2 border and threaten villages and civilians			0
the @entity15 cease - fire agreement would have allowed them to continue that work			1
but beyond that , responsible leaders in both countries must acknowledge there is no military solution to this conflict and that @entity59 civilians , who have been cynically exploited by @entity11 , are suffering unendurable losses			0
the @entity2 government has a vital interest in supporting @entity15 's efforts to get massive humanitarian aid into @entity7 and also fostering longer - term projects to spur economic development there			1
in the middle of a war , it is natural to want one 's own side to strike a shattering blow from which the enemy can not quickly or easily recover			0
but @entity2 needs to offer the people of @entity7 some hope			2
people without hope have nothing to lose			0
they are the wellspring of support for @entity11 and even more extreme groups			0
@entity32 may not have wanted this war and has probably been dragged in deeper than he anticipated			0
he tried to avoid a ground operation and delayed it as long as he could			0
he accepted a cease - fire agreement that @entity11 rejected			1
but history is rich with examples of conflicts that escalated far beyond the intentions of those who launched them			0
it happened exactly 100 years ago in august 1914			0
it happened to the @entity16 in 2003 when it invaded @entity128			0
it also happened to @entity2 when it invaded @entity130 in 1982			0
@entity2 should pay heed and , with @entity16 and international help , avoid at all costs going down that same disastrous road once again .			2

@entity136 : @entity2 - @entity16 rift over secretary @entity15 's cease - fire plan empowers hard - liners
@entity136 : @entity18 said plan was an early , confidential draft of ideas . but it was leaked
@entity136 : dispute serves @entity2 who want to reoccupy @entity7 , militant @entity11 fighters
@entity136 : @entity32 's war might be escalating far beyond what he intended
