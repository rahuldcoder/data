@entity1 a fake cyberattack was staged against a landmark telecommunications building , but it was no mere academic exercise for self - taught " ethical hackers " fighting cyberterrorism			1
the do - good hackers were indeed engaged in a serious race against the clock to solve the simulated hack , but the real prize was a chance to be identified as as undiscovered genius and potential hero some day in defending queen and country against a future , real cyberattack			1
there were also potential job offers on the line			2
that was the goal of @entity23 @entity22 on saturday , one of a series of inspirational competitions designed to find the next digital genius to defend @entity22 against devastating cyberattacks whose crimes cost the global economy an estimated $ 400 billion annually , according to a recent report			1
on wednesday , the @entity22 government also warned that a third of the country 's small - and medium - sized companies are vulnerable to losing valuable data and customers to hacking			1
those firms mistakenly believe in cybersecurity " myths " that hacking is n't likely to happen to them , the government 's @entity40 campaign said			2
in all , 24 contestants who were largely self - taught hackers raced against a clock in an exercise to restore power to @entity1 's @entity52 , which had been shut down and taken over by cyberterrorists			1
last weekend 's simulated attack was sponsored by the @entity55 , defense contractor @entity56 and @entity22 telecommunications giant @entity58			1
the drill offered a theatrical edge to the " ethical hackers , " whose job is to hack a network to evaluate security rather than do criminal damage			1
the simulation featured a video message from the bad guys , who called themselves " @entity70 , " also posted on @entity71			2
the competitors , ages 20 to 50 , attempted to restore power to the @entity52 , a communications hub whose @entity76 architecture has been described as " alienating " and " foreboding , " according to the tour guide website @entity79			2
the tower , however , offers spectacular views of @entity1 , especially from an upper floor suite that rotates at the top , where the contest was held			2
the skyscraper was designed to withstand a nuclear blast with a war room in the basement			2
the participants worked in teams of four and sought to win the challenge so that they could advance to a master class , to take place in march and include a total of 42 winners from other competitions			1
the good - guy hackers had to decide which programs and techniques to use to discover a new password and trace the cyberterrorists ' path , so that the code breakers could reverse the attack			2
during the competition , participants worked feverishly , and hamburgers remained half - eaten as fingertips tapped away at keyboards			2
the contestants worked without break for an hour			0
the teams were identified by colors , and in the end , it was @entity117 that won the challenge , earning its place in the master class final in @entity1 on march 12 , joining other nationwide winners from prior rounds of similar contests			1
to illustrate that electricity was restored and the challenge over , the tower dramatically rotated 360 degrees , a rare spin for the crown of the building			0
@entity130 , @entity56 cybersecurity manager , said his research team has found recruits from what seem may the most unlikely walks of life : one was a ballroom dancer teacher and another was a welder			0
he hoped to find more hidden talent from the contest			0
" well this shows how good they are , and it means it is easy for us to come and say actually this person is really talented			0
they just need a helping hand to get into cybersecurity , " he added			0
" these are some of the best talents we have that are n't in the cybersecurity business today			0
these are ones who are really spending their own time to be skilled , to understand what is going on in the it world and where the risks are , and those are the people we ca n't find through normal recruitment because perhaps they do n't think they are good enough , " @entity130 said			0
experts from @entity55 , @entity58 , @entity56 and @entity164 evaluated the performance of the code breakers			0
" we give people the skills to be able to remain on the right side of the law , " said @entity167 , head of @entity168			0
" of course , it is always down to the individual what path they take , but we will give them the utmost encouragement to choose the right side of the law			0
" the challenge began in 2010 as a government initiative to tackle the growing level of cybercrime in the @entity22			1
the issue has become urgent because @entity22 schools had overlooked computer science			1
as growing cyberthreats worry government and business , a huge skill shortage has emerged			0
though computer science is now making a comeback to @entity22 classrooms , there remains a generational gap , organizers said			1
cybercrime stands as one of the @entity22 's biggest threats , and the competition is a crucial initiative in finding raw talent for the @entity22 government and the country 's corporations			1
many contestants are so raw that they never took formal training , said @entity208 , ceo of @entity22 @entity23			1
" some of them are at university , but you 'll find an awful lot of these people have learned these skills by going to @entity215 and taught themselves , " @entity208 said			0
" we hope to persuade them to formalize those skills and move into jobs			0
" about 19,000 people in the @entity22 registered to participate in the challenge			1
but only 3,000 of them are selected for the annual event , and from that pool , about 100 are selected to take part in one of four cyberattack simulations , such as the mock attack on the @entity52 on saturday			1
even if a contestant does n't win or make it to the final round , 80 to 100 code breakers are hired every year by companies that use the competition as a recruiting ground , organizers said			2
for their efforts and as a possible item on their resumes , every contestant receives a certificate of having participated in the " face - to - face " competition against the fictional cyberterrorists			0

19,000 " ethical hackers " register to compete in @entity23 @entity22
3,000 of them will be selected to compete in simulated cyberattacks
only 42 of them will win and be chosen for a master class
