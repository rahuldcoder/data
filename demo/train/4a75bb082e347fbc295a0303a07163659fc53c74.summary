-- january 20 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : hi , i 'm @entity17			2
in today 's edition of @entity0 , we 're breaking down a debate over part of the @entity22			1
first , though , a @entity23 welcome			2
first up : presidential visit @entity25 : that 's first lady @entity27 and president @entity28 officially welcoming @entity30 president @entity29 to the @entity23			1
this ceremony happened yesterday morning			2
president @entity29 was met by several top @entity34 officials as well as a military honor guard			1
kicked off a day of meetings between the two leaders			2
during a news conference later in the day , the @entity30 president said his country and the @entity34 " share broad common interests and important common responsibilities			1
" one of those common interests : the global economy			2
we want you to have a look at this online interactive from @entity49			0
this is a list of the largest economies in 2010			0
when you rank them by size , like they are here , you can see that the @entity34 is number one , more than twice the size of @entity30 , which is number two			1
but when you rank these world economies by how much they grew in 2010 , watch what happens			1
@entity30 moves to number one ; it grew more than 10 percent last year			1
and the @entity34 is n't even on that list			1
with @entity30 's economy getting bigger , some people think it 's important for other countries -- like the @entity34 -- to learn more about @entity30 culture			1
there are some school programs doing exactly that			0
but as @entity72 explains , there 's some concern about who 's paying for these programs			1
( begin video ) @entity77 , @entity0 all - platform journalist : in this class , it 's easy to forget you 're in suburban @entity5			1
teachers are prepping kids for an increasingly global economy , one that will inevitably involve @entity30 , the world 's second largest economy			1
@entity88 , chinese language student : i think it 's very valuable to learn a language that a lot of people in the @entity34 will speak in the future and certainly is huge in business			1
@entity96 : the school hosts visiting teachers from @entity30 , and they 're planning a student trip to the nation this summer			1
it 's funded in part by the @entity30 government			1
this school will get $ 30,000			0
by and large , the school 's endeavor is being received with open arms			1
but that said , not everyone 's ready to embrace a warm and fuzzy relationship with @entity30			1
the @entity111 outside @entity112 was poised to receive similar funds from the @entity30 government , but community members were n't comfortable with what they call " communist propaganda " in the hands of elementary students			1
back in @entity5 , administrators say the @entity30 government has no say in what the school teaches			1
but students and faculty say anti-chinese sentiment still shows up			1
as a teacher , do you ever hear people say , " i do n't want my kids learning @entity30 because that 's a communist country " ? @entity129 , chinese teacher : yes			1
@entity96 : @entity133 professor @entity132 specializes in @entity30			1
@entity134 , @entity133 : i do n't think they 're going to go on record , or going to go through the school and , you know , let 's teach you how to form a communist cell			1
you know , that 's not going to happen			1
but there are subtle things			0
@entity96 : subtle things , he says , like a visiting teacher from @entity30 potentially overstepping bounds			1
this school says , bottom line , opening a dialogue between the two nations is a good place to start			0
@entity72 , @entity0 , @entity4 , @entity5			0
( @entity154 ) @entity155 @entity156 , @entity15 : time for the shoutout ! what @entity34 constitutional amendment addresses the right to bear arms ? if you think you know it , then shout it out ! is it the : a ) 2nd amendment , b ) 5th amendment , c ) 16th amendment or @entity170 ) 23rd amendment ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! that right is covered in the @entity173 , and it 's led to a lot of debate			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! the @entity173 @entity25 : okay , as promised , we 're turning our attention to the @entity22 and specifically the @entity173			1
this is an amendment that has been debated for decades , and that debate gets a lot of attention after an event like the shooting in @entity188 , @entity189			1
but to understand what the disagreement is over , you 've got ta first understand exactly what the amendment says : " a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed			1
" so , does this mean that a militia or the people should have guns ? ah , there 's the rub			1
many supporters of gun control look to the first part of the amendment for their argument			0
their view : this amendment protects the right of a militia , like the @entity215 , to have guns , but not necessarily everyone else			0
so , this is an interpretation that effectively limits who can carry a firearm			0
people who support gun rights generally look to the second part of the @entity173 , the part that says " the right of the people to keep and bear arms			1
" their view : this amendment protects individuals ' rights to have guns			0
so , this interpretation suggests non-military citizens should be free to have firearms			0
now , here 's where the legislative and judicial systems come in			1
@entity238 has passed laws that limit who can get or transport guns			0
but the @entity242 has mostly left the issue of gun control for states to decide			0
i say " mostly " because it did make a decision last year that basically said this : the @entity173 guarantees that individuals may have guns , and that guarantee must factor in to state laws			1
is this legit ? @entity254 , @entity15 : is this legit ? bats are the only animals that use echolocation , a process of using sound to locate objects			2
not legit ! some birds , whales and dolphins use this process , as well			2
@entity265 @entity25 : i always remember studying echolocation in association with dolphins			1
you might be familiar with echolocation by another name , though : sonar			2
it 's pretty much the same thing			2
you send out these sound waves , and when they bounce off of objects , the reflection of the waves tells you -- or in this case , the animal -- where the objects are			0
we 're gon na take it to @entity286 , now , who takes us to the @entity287 , where researchers are putting some dolphins ' echolocation skills to the test			1
( begin video ) @entity293 , @entity294 : say hello to @entity295			0
@entity296 , @entity297 's trainer : hi , buddy			2
@entity300 : the 8 - year - old bottlenose dolphin is not only a good - looking dude , he 's also really smart			2
@entity303 : all right , @entity295			0
let 's show them what echolocation looks like			1
@entity300 : trainer @entity308 throws a ring out in the water with cups over his eyes so he ca n't see			0
@entity295 , using his echolocation , his underwater sonar , finds and retrieves the ring			2
that 's pretty cool , right ? well , at the @entity320 in the @entity287 , scientists have found dolphins ' smarts ... @entity303 : really blew us away			1
@entity300 : ... go way beyond ring retrieval			0
@entity303 : monkey see , monkey do ; that 's a myth			2
it turns out that the animal best able to imitate other than humans is the dolphin			0
@entity300 : for their study , @entity295 was paired with another dolphin			0
here , it 's @entity336			2
the trainer gives @entity295 the hand gesture that means imitate and then covers both @entity295 's eyes			2
@entity336 is signaled to do a specific behavior			0
@entity336 waves his tail , @entity295 imitates him perfectly			0
@entity303 : wow ! you got it ! that was it			0
@entity300 : the behaviors are all pre-taught , like splashing the water or running the lagoon			0
@entity300 : but with his blindfold , @entity295 has no idea which behavior @entity336 is doing			0
how does @entity295 do it ? maybe his sonar , or he 's picking the characteristic sound made by the behavior			2
researchers and trainers specifically chose behaviors that were safe for @entity295			2
for instance , they did n't want him jumping out of the water while he was wearing the eye cups			0
researchers say the dolphins ' cognitive ability to understand what it means to imitate and then carry it out is amazing			1
@entity367 , director of research , @entity320 : that shows a kind of problem - solving flexibility that we have n't seen anywhere else			0
@entity300 : during the actual research project , @entity295 imitated the behaviors successfully more than 58 percent of the time , ruling out luck or chance			0
@entity303 : @entity336 brought a rock			0
oh , so did @entity295 ! @entity300 : @entity286 , @entity0 , @entity380 in the @entity287			0
( @entity154 ) before we go @entity25 : it 's always amazing to consider how intelligent dolphins are			1
now usually , our before we go is about animals in some way			0
now , that last story was about animals , so today , we are going from the @entity6 heat to the @entity7 cold to show you what some people are doing : extreme mountain biking			2
or really lazy skiing , depending on how you look at this			0
it does kinda look like fun			0
the idea seems to be trading in tires for skis , swapping out poles for handlebars , and then just ripping your way or , as might be in my case , crashing your way down the mountain			0
it might seem a bit daunting , but if you can make it out of the starting gates ... goodbye @entity25 : ... chances are , it 's all downhill from there			2
you might 've seen that one coming			0
we 'll try again ! you know some thrill seeker probably came up with this ski - eme just for fun			0
but i 'm guessing halfway down the slope , he realized it was snow laughing matter			0
all right ! for @entity0 , i 'm @entity17			0
that wraps up our show today , but we are coming back tomorrow , where fridays are always awesome on our show			2
look forward to seeing you then			0
have a great afternoon !			0

examine a program that teaches @entity30 language and culture to @entity34 students
