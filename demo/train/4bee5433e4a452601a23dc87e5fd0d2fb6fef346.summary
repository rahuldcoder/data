according to ancient legend , @entity0 was once an immortal battlefield , with gods waging war in lava fields			1
plumes of lava represented souls flung out from the inferno , while volcanoes were portals to hell			1
as one of the most volcanic regions in the world today , @entity0 is home to more than 130 volcanic mountains -- many of them " active , " meaning that they 've erupted during the past few centuries			1
it 's also the only place on @entity20 you can take an elevator inside a volcano 's magma chamber			1
in may , for the third year in a row , @entity25 ( " @entity26 " ) is open to visitors brave enough to venture inside			1
hotspot located south of the capital @entity31 , @entity25 sits at the center of the @entity33 , a submarine mountain range running along the @entity35			0
while volcanic chambers are usually sealed shut , @entity25 's is n't , and scientists are n't sure why			1
the magma seems to have drained away , leaving a chasm under @entity0 's surface			1
@entity44 explorer dr. @entity42 discovered @entity25 's magma chamber in 1974			1
he fought to open the chamber to visitors and has championed sustainable approaches to the project in numerous academic papers			1
the first tourists took the plunge in 2012			1
the tour begins our tour to the heart of the volcano starts at the foot of the @entity60 mountain range , where roads end			2
guides lead us across the lava fields to a welcome cabin , which is constructed each may with parts brought in by helicopter			0
hauling metal sheeting and equipment to this remote area takes more than a week with three helicopters			0
in september , the end of tour season , the cabin is dismantled again and nothing is left behind			0
it 's less than an hour 's hike to the cabin , but the terrain of gnarled basalt wreaks havoc on all but the toughest of hiking boots			2
inside , we 're sized for harnesses and helmets			0
the promise of traditional meat soup distracts those visitors with vertigo			2
@entity88 for ' hidden people ' a short walk leads from the cabin up to the northeastern peak			0
from the top of the cinder cone , which rises 35 meters higher than its surroundings , the land looks vast and empty			0
there 's no trace of civilization , just rocks sprinkled with moss and splatters of lichen and ashy peaks extending to the horizon			2
traditionally , these rocks and small underground caves are associated with huldufólk , @entity0 's " hidden people			1
" our journey into hell is by open cable elevator			2
the metal cage , installed in 2010 for use by researchers , takes small groups of tourists down the neck of the crater into a chamber taller than the @entity122			1
there are plans to build a tunnel connecting the chamber to the surface , but the project 's impact is still being evaluated -- allowing access is n't without risk			1
human influence threatens the cave 's unique beauty , and visitors must tread lightly , taking away anything they bring and not removing fragments of rock			1
an additional disincentive against theft is the huldufólk -- legend has it they react violently to any pillaging of @entity0 's natural wealth			1
making the descent after the lift operator attaches each visitor 's harness to the elevator frame with carabiners , he jolts the elevator into action and it rumbles slowly into a deep crevice in the ground			2
the metal cage scrapes loudly against the rock face as droplets of water roll from the rocks and thunk onto our helmets			0
after plummeting 120 meters , the elevator drops onto the magma chamber 's floor			1
there 's no sound except dripping water and the sky is only visible as a distant chink of light			2
separation from the world above is total			0
exploring the chamber untethered from the elevator cage , we 're free to clamber around the cave floor			2
the walls glow bronze and indigo , like the sheen on spilled oil			0
the parts of the cave baked by sulfur - rich gases are marked by yellow , while patches of cobalt blue show where chunks of rock have crashed from the walls			0
we see icicles of rock , where magma hardened as it dripped to the cave floor			2
although relatively little is known about the ecosystem here , the vivid colors on the rocks are attributed to clusters of microorganisms			0
a few visitors point nervously at puffs of steam rising from the cavern 's far corners			1
" the elves are smoking , " jokes our guide , @entity208			0
in reality , the puffs come from moisture evaporating as droplets hit the surface of electric lamps , the only light sources in the cave , but it 's easy to see how the myths about elves began			0
" you can imagine , when you are walking alone in the fog and there 's all these strange formations , " says @entity208			0
when we 're brought back up to the daylight , i find that my eyes are easily deceived			0
distant lumps of granite seem to moving , while patterns on the ground take on the appearance of portals to another world			0
guided tours of @entity25 's interior are available through inside the @entity237 ; +354 863 6640 ; five tours daily from may 15 - september 30 , 2014 ; minimum age 12 years old			0

first tourists went into the volcano in 2012
scientists are n't sure why @entity243 's magma crater is n't sealed shut like other volcanoes
