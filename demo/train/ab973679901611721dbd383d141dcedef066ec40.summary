@entity0 -- the announcement by the @entity3 that the population stood at 308,745,538 on april 1 is a number for which many people have been waiting			2
@entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 had the fastest growth this decade while slow growth was seen in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
@entity17 was the only state to see a decline			0
most people poring over the 2010 state counts are doing so with an eye to future elections , but it makes sense to proceed cautiously before drawing any hard conclusions about what that data mean in the political context			0
attention is focused on 12 seats in the @entity32 that will be leaving slow - growth states in the @entity34 and @entity35 and moving to the @entity36 and @entity37 as populations there continued to grow quickly			1
census 2010 : @entity41 grew at slowest rate since the depression @entity44 is the big winner , with four new @entity32 seats			1
since the states losing seats are usually regarded as blue , tending to elect @entity51 , and those gaining seats are normally considered red , tending to elect @entity54 , it would be easy to assume tuesday 's census release is good news for that party and alarming news for @entity51			1
it 's not that simple			0
if we regard simple population change as an indicator of political power , the buildup in red states is indeed significant			1
however , early next year , the @entity3 will release counts of the population by race and ethnicity			2
that number will show shifts of the population that official estimates have pointed to all along : the diversifying of the population is more extensive in areas of fast population growth			2
many of the states that have gained in their head count have gained non-white minorities , especially @entity82			1
estimates already show that four states that gained seats -- @entity44 , @entity86 , @entity8 and @entity87 -- are highly ranked in the top 10 states for growth in the @entity91 population during this decade			1
moreover , more than half the population growth in those states alone came from increases in the @entity82 population			1
these additions were a result of net immigration and births in those states			2
while the large increase in @entity82 in these high - growth states includes some immigrant newcomers ineligible to vote , eligible @entity100 tend to vote @entity51 in most of the states that gained seats			1
that may change by 2012 , but much will happen between now and then			0
putting this into further perspective , the @entity41 population grew by 9.7 % between 2000 and 2010 , slower than any decade since the @entity109 in the 1930s			1
with the @entity112 taking hold at the end of the 2000s , slowing immigration and birth rates , it is possible that slower growth will continue , at least for the short term			0
thus , the sizeable increase in minority populations comes at a time when the overall population is growing more slowly			0
thus the sweeping demographic changes going on in our nation are much more significant than just shifts in where people live			0
we are becoming more diverse , and , as many analysts have noted , we will be a white - minority nation in about 30 years			0
so simply looking at geography may not yield correct results when we 're talking about how new populations may behave and particularly how they may vote			2
the excitement that demographers feel about this once - a - decade population snapshot is likely overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of political analysts , who are busy discovering what state - level population shifts mean for state reapportionment and redistricting within states			2
but as we can see by looking more carefully at the data , there is more to population shifts than a simple rearranging of the map based on total counts			0
we 're in for a much more interesting and challenging time than many people may believe			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity154 .			0

@entity156 puts @entity41 population at 308.7 *million* , with red states *generally* *posting* fastest growth
singer : some analysts say census results will *strengthen* the @entity54
she says minorities *account* for much of the growth and *historically* have *favored* *democrats*
singer : in most of the states that gained seats , eligible @entity100 tend to vote @entity51
