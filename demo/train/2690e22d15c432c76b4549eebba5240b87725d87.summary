-- what can a pod of dolphins teach golfers ? quite a lot according to @entity5 , the last man to captain the @entity7 to victory in the @entity9 , back in 2008			1
another humbling at the hands of @entity12 , who completed a third straight victory in the biennial team tussle at @entity16 last month , provoked a familiar wave of @entity7 introspection			1
surprisingly , it was sparked by one of its own team members -- five - time major winner @entity20 -- who launched an astonishing critique of the job done by 2014 skipper @entity25			1
the 44 - year - old lauded @entity5 's leadership during the 2008 tournament at a tense press conference at @entity16 , hours after @entity12 's 16½ - 11½ success had been confirmed			1
@entity20 said @entity5 had involved the players in his decision making process and formulated a " real game plan , " the implication being that @entity25 had done neither during his tenure			1
the 64 - year - old veteran , who was the last man to secure a @entity7 triumph on @entity12 soil in 1993 , sat listening to @entity20 's monologue with a painted smile on his face			1
he then replied : " ( @entity20 ) has a difference of opinion			1
my management philosophy is different than his			0
i had a different philosophy than @entity5			1
i decided not to go that way			0
" prior to the 40th installment of the competition in @entity51 , @entity0 spoke to @entity5 , who laid out the principles he felt were instrumental in sealing what is still @entity7 's only triumph this century			1
one of the fundamental aspects of his captaincy centered around a pod system , relating to the way dolphins coexist with one another , where the 12 players are split into three teams of four			2
" i tried to get my players invested and engaged in the process early , " @entity5 told @entity0 's @entity65 show			1
" then i gave ownership of their little small man groups and empowered them by allowing them to pick who filled out their team			0
these guys bonded and we were bonded as a team with a secret			0
" that 's what we built prior to the matches and prior to showing up at @entity82			2
" @entity5 , who revealed he 'd spoken to @entity25 before the tournament but had " no idea " what the captain was planning , wrote a book about his success called ' cracking the @entity89			1
' in it he details how the " code " was concerned with team building and applying business principles to the @entity9 formula			1
it also embraced the @entity97 test -- used by government agencies , colleges and @entity101 departments -- to group people together based on their personality traits			2
" the code was through observation , " he explained			0
" i see what @entity12 has in place ; the @entity107 play together , the @entity108 , the @entity109			0
" if there 's crossover you 'll get best friends like an @entity108 in @entity114 and an @entity115 like @entity116 , so there 's small groups already in place			2
" i 'm using their personality types to put the players in groups through observation about who they are , breaking everybody into four personality types			2
it was really a leadership philosophy to team building that 's the code			2
" it became more of a relational story than a golf event for me and for our players			0
of course they played great but we created the atmosphere and platform for them to play their best			0
" the code was that @entity12 had small groups , we went with small groups , that 's a @entity141 philosophy to team building			0
" to apply those militaristic principles and those business principles to a sporting event and watch it unfold the way it did -- that was the cracking of the code to me			0
" @entity12 's players were falling over themselves to praise their captain , @entity152 , who they said was meticulous in his preparation			2
not only did @entity152 get to know his players over the course of his captaincy , he also ensured they all felt invested , even detailing one of his five vice-captains to look after those players who were n't selected to play			0
the @entity108 also prepared motivational speeches and videos for his team , even going so far to ensure the goldfish in @entity12 's team room were blue and gold -- the colors of the continent 's flag			0
@entity152 would surely have scored highly in @entity5 's recipe for what constitutes a good captain			1
" a great captain has to be organized , " @entity5 said			1
" you have to have the willingness to surround yourself with people that can help you , and you have to make it not about you , you have to make the captaincy about the players around you			0
" you have to realize you do n't get to play but that you have a responsibility and a leadership role of making the guys around you comfortable , confident			0
" i wanted everyone to have confidence in my confidence in them			0
and treat them like men , they are professionals			0
" i messaged players according to their personality type , situational messaging -- i did n't give everyone the same message			0
" you have to build that type of environment and then you have to get out of their way			0
" the calls for @entity5 to reprise his role in 2016 began almost as soon as the @entity7 defeat was confirmed			1
@entity20 's praise was followed by a tweet from @entity204 , a member of the @entity7 team that succumbed to the " @entity206 " back in 2012 , that read " @ @entity208			1
" " we all do the best that we can and we 're all trying our hardest , and i 'm just looking back at what gave us the most success , " @entity20 added in his @entity5 tribute			1
" unfortunately , we have strayed from a winning formula in 2008 for the last three @entity215 , and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best			2

@entity5 is hotly *tipped* to be the @entity7 @entity9 captain in 2016
@entity20 lauded @entity5 's captaincy during @entity7 success back in 2008
@entity20 was critical of @entity25 's leadership during competition in @entity51
@entity5 says personality matching was a big part of his captaincy *blueprint*
