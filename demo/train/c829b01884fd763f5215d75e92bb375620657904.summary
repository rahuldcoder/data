-- is the dome doomed ? voters may have given the @entity3 , @entity5 's iconic and once cutting - edge stadium , the kiss of death			1
it 's too early to write an obituary for the structure once deemed the " @entity10 , " but the defeat of the bond initiative tuesday night stacks the odds against the dome			2
voters in @entity16 were given a voice on whether to issue $ 217 million in bonds to transform the deteriorating structure into a mammoth exhibition and event space			2
the county owns the @entity3 , and its commissioners had warned that if the measure did not pass , the only course left would be to demolish it			1
the proposition was rejected by a 53 % -47 % vote			1
@entity16 judge @entity38 " said that with voters rejecting the only viable public option and no viable private option on the table , there 's little choice but to demolish the dome , " the judge 's spokesman , @entity29 , said			2
however , nothing can happen until the county commission meets and votes to go ahead with the demolition			2
the item has not been added to the commission 's agenda , but it could happen as early as next tuesday			0
a majority of the commissioners had said that if the proposition failed , that they would favor demolition			0
6 imperiled and extinct sports sites @entity50 not lacking whether they voted for or against the measure to save the @entity3 , @entity5 share a nostalgia for the stadium			1
completed in 1965 , it was the first domed stadium in the world and was deemed a remarkable feat of engineering			2
the dome was the primary home of the @entity60 and the @entity61 , in addition to hosting rodeos , concerts and other events			0
@entity66 , 38 , remembers being dropped off at the @entity3 with his friends as children and catching a ball game before walking to the nearby ( and now defunct ) astroworld theme park			1
" it was a fun way to spend your days during the summer , " he said			0
" there are just so many memories there			0
" @entity66 voted in favor of saving the dome based on the renderings he saw of the kind of space the new dome would be			0
the space would make it bigger than the city 's convention center , and the redesign would retain the feel of the old stadium while modernizing it			2
remodeling made economic sense , he said : the county could not buy land in such a prime location and erect a structure of such ambition for such a good price			0
the @entity3 was always a symbol of pride for the city , said @entity102 , a 32 - year - old @entity5 native			1
but he voted against the resolution because the structure had already begun to fall into disrepair years ago			0
the dome looked outdated sitting next to the more modern @entity106 , and fixing it up just did n't seem worth the cost , he said			0
" everything has its time , and everything 's time comes to an end , " he said			0
endangered building months before the vote , before it was even announced that a vote would be held , the @entity118 included the @entity3 on its yearly list of " @entity120			1
" on the same day that the @entity16 revitalization proposal was floated , the trust named the dome one of 35 " national treasures " in the country			1
the designation meant that the trust put its resources to work in an attempt to save the @entity3			1
" we 're disappointed this morning , " @entity130 , a senior field officer for the trust , said the day after the vote			2
" i think ( the outcome ) was less of a comment on the value of the building , the heritage associated with it and more the confusion that surrounded the @entity3 these last years , " she said			1
for the past five years , the @entity3 has been essentially vacant			1
the electricity and water are still on , but it is unoccupied and used mostly for storage			0
it costs the county an estimated $ 2 million to $ 3 million to maintain it , the county said			0
several ideas from the private sector have appeared over the years , but nothing with funding			0
as ideas have come and gone , @entity130 believes that many voters misunderstood that tuesday 's vote may have been a definitive move on the building 's fate			1
now that the votes have been cast and the @entity3 is in serious jeopardy , @entity130 predicted there will be a great number of @entity5 who will regret the loss of the stadium			1
if the city indeed has a change of heart at this point , the only way out might be for a " white knight " from the private sector to swoop in with a plan , said @entity29 , the county judge 's spokesman .			0
