it 's a horrifying tale : three young women are held captive for nearly a decade , spending some of that time in chains			2
but in the story of their dramatic escape from a @entity9 home last monday , an @entity4 star has emerged			1
@entity10 , the man who , along with fellow neighbor @entity11 , helped rescue victim @entity10 , has gone from struggling dishwasher to viral sensation overnight			1
@entity10 's role in the rescue -- he heard @entity16 screaming and , thinking she was escaping a domestic dispute , kicked open a door for her -- has made him a hero to many			1
but his straight - shooting retelling of the story , with its colorful asides and sometimes - profane vernacular , is what 's captivated a web where nothing is sacred and front - page news becomes meme - worthy amusement at lightning speed			1
" the internet likes to celebrate our heroes , " said @entity33 , ceo of @entity34 , which includes the site @entity35			0
a video of @entity10 was the top item on the site wednesday			1
" in our own way , this is our celebration of @entity10			1
" of course , there was the inevitable auto - tune			1
the @entity46 , known for " @entity47 , " " @entity48 " and other @entity4 - famous , @entity50 reworkings of web video , crafted " @entity53 " from media interviews with @entity10			1
" my neighbor 's got big testicles because we see this dude every day , " goes one oft - repeated line			1
" we eat ribs with this dude			0
" several images of @entity10 had popped up by wednesday on @entity62 , a site that lets people add presumably humorous text to stock photos			2
and , in another web certainty for overnight sensations , he 's had several fake ( or , if you prefer , parody ) accounts created in his name on @entity73			0
speaking of @entity73 , @entity74 's did n't waste any time getting mileage off of the story after @entity10 repeatedly said he was eating food from the chain when he heard @entity16 's screams			1
" we salute the courage of @entity83 kidnap victims & respect their privacy , " the company tweeted tuesday from its corporate account			0
way to go @entity10 - we 'll be in touch			1
" but if much of the online attention was designed to turn @entity10 into entertainment , some of it was just to say " thank you			1
" at least two fundraising efforts are under way on @entity94 , an online fundraising site			0
one , titled " thank you @entity10 , " had already topped its goal of $ 10,000 in little over a day early thursday			2
its creator , @entity99 of @entity101 , @entity102 , promises to deliver the funds to @entity10 and document the donation			2
" thank you for doing what you did ... thank you for the fantastic interviews , " @entity99 wrote			0
" you made our day			0
" there was another effort on the site but , as of wednesday morning , it had n't received any donations			0
for his part , @entity10 has said that , despite sometimes struggling financially , he would give any reward money he receives to the victims			2
praise for @entity10 appeared to only cool off marginally thursday as reports surfaced that he did prison time in the ' 90s , and again about a decade ago , on domestic abuse charges and for drug and trespassing arrests			2
@entity10 himself referenced his past in at least one interview , and many online seemed willing to give him credit for paying for his crimes and perhaps redeeming them , at least in part			1
" @entity10 did horrible things 10 years ago			2
he was a hero on may 6 , 2013 , " @entity132 wrote for @entity133 , a news site " for black @entity135			0
" " he served time for the former ; he should be allowed to serve time as the latter			0
" mostly , however , the @entity4 chuckled			0
it 's the sort of mix of appreciation and amusement that can only happen on the modern web , evoking memories of insta - famous folks , from frustrated flight attendant @entity145 to @entity147 " @entity148 to @entity149 , the hyper - animated sign - language interpreter for @entity152 mayor @entity151 who found web fame during @entity155			1
but some see a more troubling side of the @entity4 's fascination with @entity10			1
these observers say the @entity10 memes are reminiscent of the viral fame foisted upon people like @entity163 ( " @entity166 yo ' kids / hide yo ' wife " ) and @entity164 ( " ai n't nobody got time for that " ) -- in other words , poor , black people in scary situations whose emotional reactions are turned into punchlines			2
" it 's difficult to watch these videos and not sense that their popularity has something to do with a persistent , if unconscious , desire to see black people perform , " @entity175 wrote tuesday for @entity176			0
" even before the genuinely heroic @entity10 came along , some viewers had expressed concern that the laughter directed at people like @entity164 plays into the most basic stereotyping of blacks as simple - minded ramblers living in the ' ghetto , ' socially out of step with the rest of educated @entity135			1
" huh acknowledged that some viral takes on these instant celebrities are more tasteful than others			0
but he downplayed the importance of race for most viewers			0
" i 've seen this happen to every race , every color , every situation , " he said			0
" they love this guy , not because he is some funny black man , but because he did something great and did n't walk away from a bad situation			0
" that said , @entity33 predicted that on the web of 2013 , @entity10 's appeal may fade more quickly than , say , that of mr. @entity212 or the " @entity48 " guy , because much of the reaction has grown predictable			1
" it 's almost like there 's a cottage industry of people now trying to get famous by turning things into a meme , " he said			0
" that kind of takes the fun out of it			0
" @entity10 is probably going to have a much shorter shelf life ... but one of the nice things about a story like this is we get to celebrate a person who did something good			2

online , @entity9 rescuer @entity10 is an instant star
@entity10 kicked open a door for escaping victim @entity10
his colorful response has been auto - tuned and *imitated*
some see troubling racial *undertones* in the @entity242 's amusement
