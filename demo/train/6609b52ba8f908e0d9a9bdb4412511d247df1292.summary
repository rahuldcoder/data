@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is one of the busiest junctions in the heart of @entity0			1
until recently , it was also the most congested			0
every hour , almost 40,000 people were herded around the crossroads in slow , cramped , and sometimes dangerous conditions			1
it is also the busiest pedestrian crossing in @entity13 , according to @entity14			1
getting from one side of the road to the other , a distance of a few meters , could take an unreasonably long time and many @entity19 thought there was little that could ever be done about it			0
that is until @entity14 , inspired by @entity26 's famous @entity25 crossing , decided that a similar crossing could solve their @entity3 congestion , and make the lives of tens of thousands of pedestrians just a little more pleasant			1
the redesigned crossing has increased the amount of pavement space by 312 square meters , up 69 percent from its previous capacity			2
@entity36 , director of transportation for @entity14 told @entity2 : " it has really been a phenomenal change from pedestrian hell to pedestrian heaven and what it has done is actually make retailers worldwide want to think about coming to the @entity44			1
" we created more space , increased the amount of pedestrian space by about 70 percent , we have removed all of the pedestrian guard railing , we have created a much better environment for pedestrians			0
" @entity53 , a secretary on a day trip to @entity0 from @entity55 , @entity56 , agrees : " it is much better , there is n't so much congestion and i got across the road without getting pushed and shoved			0
" @entity61 , a security guard in one of the retail stores on @entity3 said : " it works really well , i use it every day and it is it quicker and safer than it was before			2
there 's a junction down the road that i think is really dangerous and should be changed as well			2
" @entity14 believes the $ 7.6 million investment is worth it , saying the diagonal crossing not only reduces pedestrian travel time but also safety and that it has transformed what was once a haven for pickpockets into a much safer environment because pedestrians now have more personal space			1
the crossing was jointly funded by @entity82 , which owns @entity83 , and @entity84			2
could it work in other congested cities ? " i can see it working in an awful lot of other places , yes			0
i think across the world people are now starting to think more about the pedestrians			0
and let us face it , all of us , for some part of our journey , are a pedestrian , " says @entity36 .			0

almost 40,000 people use @entity3 crossing every hour says @entity14
the $ 7.6 million diagonal crossing was inspired by @entity26 's famous @entity25 crossing
