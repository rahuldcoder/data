at the port in @entity2 , recovery teams continue to fill trucks with the bodies they 're still pulling from the sea			1
more than 300 so far -- and that number could rise			1
they are among the more than 500 @entity10 migrants believed to have been aboard a boat that sank off the island last thursday			1
the tragedy amounted to @entity15 's deadliest migrant shipwreck and , according to @entity2 mayor @entity16 , " the biggest sea tragedy in the @entity18 since @entity19 " the survivors -- 155 of them , mainly from @entity21 , who swam for their lives and were lucky enough to be rescued by fishermen and the @entity24 -- wait in a cramped migrant detention center			1
it was built to hold about 250 people but has held many times that in recent days			1
each day , more people are leaving on ferries for other detention centers along the @entity15 coast , though 900 nonetheless remained tuesday			1
opinion : @entity34 must be open to refugees fleeing persecution the traumatic firsthand accounts are helping build a picture of why the boat ended up on the seabed of the @entity18 with most of its passengers entombed below deck			1
one of them , 30 - year - old @entity44 , told @entity45 he 'll never forget what he saw			0
" for five hours we were floating , using the dead bodies of our companions , " he said			1
" there is nothing worse than this			0
there was a mother with her four children , a mother with an infant , all lost at sea			2
my mind is scarred and in a terrible condition			0
" survivors mourn victims of @entity15 shipwreck perilous journey , then 13 days at sea the voyage to @entity2 was supposed to be one of the migrant 's last on a long , sometimes painful journey to a new life			1
take a woman named @entity75 , who asked not to use her family name , for fear of retaliation against her family back home in @entity21			2
the single mother of a 4 - year - old boy felt she had to escape the coastal east @entity10 nation , where she had no money for food or medical care			0
it was not done on a whim , especially given smugglers ' demands			0
" our relatives and friends sold all that they had -- some little gold jewels , a piece of land or their house -- to sponsor our trip , " @entity75 said			0
that trek took her across @entity10 -- jammed tight in jeeps crossing the @entity102 with only a few biscuits and juice to sustain them , packed in garages , occasionally beaten with a plastic water pipe if they talked or raised their eyes , she recalled			0
@entity75 and others ' hope was simple : to have a better life			0
but the boat 's sinking first threatened her life , and now that she 's in @entity15 custody , her future			1
" it 's absurd , " she said			2
" we come here , we work to pay our families back -- if we do n't die			1
" she and others spent 13 days at sea before their boat 's engine stopped less than a mile from @entity2 , @entity15 's closest island to @entity10 about halfway between @entity123 and @entity124			1
it 's a common destination for refugees seeking to enter @entity128 countries , and a common site of shipwrecks			2
@entity2 : why tough penalties will not work fire on board there 's been criticism that more was not done to help , that the @entity15 coast guard was too slow to respond , that they spent precious time filming footage of the rescue instead of saving more lives			2
@entity141 , 18 , swears an @entity15 vessel spotted them in trouble off the coast , but did nothing			0
" the @entity15 's boat started circling around us			1
they circled our boat twice , then just went away , " he said			2
" that 's when people started to panic			1
" the boat 's captain told the passengers to set fire to clothes and blankets to attract attention			1
" he gathered some clothes and bed sheets and lit them			0
but his container of benzene exploded , " @entity141 said			0
the fire then spread , and when many of the migrants crowded to one side , the boat capsized , said @entity15 lawmaker @entity170 , citing survivors ' accounts			2
" people were screaming as the boat capsized , " @entity173 said			1
the lucky few in response to criticism , the coast guard saturday defended its response time and said its crews were on site 20 minutes after receiving the @entity185 call			0
" the moment we got the emergency call from the fishermen at 7 a.m. , we immediately intervened and started coordinating the rescue operations , " said coast guard spokesman @entity186			0
@entity192 , 23 , was one of the lucky few who were eventually rescued			0
" we left our country because of hardship , so that we could live in peace and help our families , " @entity192 said			2
" but we have found this bitter sadness			0
it was so unexpected , so disturbing			0
and now we ca n't think of anything else			2
