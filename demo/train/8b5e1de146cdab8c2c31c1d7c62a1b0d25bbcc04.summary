today was a strange day			0
i 'm used to handling the brief but overwhelming burst of media attention that comes with new stories about medical breakthroughs and ethical issues			0
but i do n't often get an accompanying deluge of passionate e-mails and phone calls from people who had read my comments , denouncing me for criticizing science , especially medical research that " can save millions of lives			1
" there is definitely something special about this idea of " therapeutic cloning , " something that has a religious feel to it			1
most of those messages come from people who have family members suffering from some of the diseases that we are told will be cured , and it 's hard to have to pour cold water on people 's hopes			0
time : scientists clone human stem cells i feel really angry at the scientists and @entity36 people who have sold the idea of cloned human stem cells to so many patient support groups , when there is so little scientific substance to their promises			1
we are told that there will be great medical benefits and that the risks that there will be cloned babies are small , but in truth it 's the other way round			2
let 's deal with the cloned babies issue first			2
ordinary people know perfectly well why human cloning is wrong , and that 's why governments around the world , including all developed nations except the @entity59 have banned it			2
but there are plenty of desperate people and egoistic tycoons wanting to be cloned , and plenty of unscrupulous @entity67 doctors happy to relieve them of their cash			2
and there are still countries where those doctors can go to evade legal sanctions			0
what the @entity73 scientists have done is to deliver the baby that the would - be human cloners have been waiting for 15 years -- what looks like a reliable technique for creating cloned embryos			1
i think it was irresponsible to publish their research before there is a comprehensive global ban on cloning , with tough sanctions			1
but i think what makes me even angrier as a scientist is the hype and false promises around therapeutic cloning			1
let 's be clear : this is not about embryonic stem cell research , which , despite the hype may deliver something given time , although the alternatives of adult stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells look set to deliver results much quicker			1
and i 'm not a pro-lifer ; destruction of embryos is not what bothers me			0
the cloning element is there purely for the purposes of creating tissues genetically identical to the patient that wo n't be rejected , and that 's a nice idea			2
the trouble is it brings a whole raft of biological problems with it that create major risks to the patient as well as creating an impossibly expensive process			0
with cloning , you are forcing nature to do something that it does not want to , so the new risks are to be expected			2
cloning creates abnormalities in the genetic read - out , which is the reason that cloned animals are so often sick			2
those errors will be there in any stem cells and tissues produced by cloning			1
those problems are another reason why cloning babies would be hugely unethical , but they do n't necessarily make it impossible			0
finally , even if you could somehow solve these problems , the use of genetically matched tissues in mainstream medicine is simply not feasible and , unlike electronic gadgets , medical costs go up , not down			0
in addition to the extremely expensive process of cloning , for each patient you have to culture stem cells and reliably turn them into the tissue you want with 100 % efficiency , so you do n't get a single left over stem cell that will cause tumors			1
you have to do all that to a standard of accuracy that will satisfy government regulators and medical liability lawyers when something goes wrong			0
we do n't do anything remotely approaching this in medicine and it does n't look like medical budgets are growing , does it ? there are other much better solutions to the tissue rejection problem that will cost a fraction of the price			0
the fact is that the cloning paper published on wednesday is zombie science			0
therapeutic cloning was dead and buried years ago , but it just seems to keep on going , and so do people 's hopes			1
there is definitely something weird here , something that brings out religious terminology like " the @entity184 of medicine " around therapeutic cloning			1
that 's because therapeutic cloning is a fantasy , one that belongs to the modern religion , the religion of technocracy			1
that 's the only way i can explain how scientists who ought to know better seem to get drunk on their power over nature and keep pursuing this absurd dream			0
people often say to me that scientists pursuing therapeutic cloning are " just trying to make money , " but the truth is worse			1
driven by their technocratic ideology , they betray their own credo of sticking to the facts , and that 's bad enough			0
but to keep raising people 's hopes in this way is really unforgivable .			0

scientists in @entity73 say they *'ve* *successfully* cloned human stem cells for first time
*advocates* of human stem cell cloning say the development will save lives
@entity220 says there is little scientific substance to the purported benefits of therapeutic cloning
@entity220 : scientists are irresponsible to publish research before global ban on cloning
