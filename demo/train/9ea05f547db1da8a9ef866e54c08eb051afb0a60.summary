nearly a decade ago , radio shock - jock @entity0 uttered these words about the women 's basketball team at @entity5 : " those are some nappy - headed hos			1
" within one week of saying that , he was out of a job			0
that 's the way it 's supposed to work			0
last week , it was revealed that @entity13 owner @entity12 said even more heinous words about blacks and @entity16			1
the @entity17 said it has confirmed that it was @entity12 's voice talking to his girlfriend : " yeah , it bothers me a lot ... that you 're associating with black people			1
do you have to ? " and now we see , within days of that revelation , he has been banned from basketball			2
that 's the way it 's supposed to work			0
in both cases , it was industry and public outrage , coupled with significant pressure from sponsors and advertisers , that led to the swift action , ripping from both of these men their public platforms and access to continued revenue			1
in the case of @entity0 , it was the outrage of many @entity45 , along with the intense feelings of journalists -- black and white -- within @entity49 , @entity50 and the profession at large			1
tv personalities like @entity53 , @entity50 board member @entity54 and others both publicly and privately called upon the leadership at @entity49 ( who carried his morning talk show on @entity59 ) and @entity50 , ( who carried his radio show ) to remove him from the air			0
at the time , i was the president of the @entity64 and was among the first to call for @entity0 to be fired			1
but it was also pressure from the public and activists such as the rev. @entity69 , who worked behind the scenes to encourage advertisers such a @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 to pull their advertising from the shows			1
this week , we saw nearly the same thing happen in the @entity12 case			1
it was the unified outrage of current and former professional basketball players in the @entity17 , the outcry from fans and the public , the relentless coverage from the media , and then the swift action by more than a dozen advertisers -- @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , to name a few -- that led to the announcement tuesday by @entity17 commissioner @entity99 that @entity12 had to go			1
as a journalist , i am the fiercest champion of the @entity101 and our right to free speech			0
in fact , one would hope that @entity12 would continue to exercise his right to free speech and speak out directly and publicly about his comments			2
we 'd offer him this space or an opportunity on @entity110 to do just that			0
but we learned from @entity0 , and again with @entity12 , that just because you have the right to free speech does n't mean you have the right to access a commercial platform or to earn millions of dollars airing that speech			1
those are both privileges that must be earned , respected and , if abused , that can be taken away			0
by the customer : the @entity45 people			0
we live in a free society , one where the ultimate arbiters of decency and honor are the marketplace and the public			0
when you cross that line , the marketplace will speak			0
that 's the way it 's supposed to work			0
in the noise of reality tv , 24 - hour news , partisan talk radio and dancing cats on the @entity137 , there are plenty of examples where the popular overwhelms the good			2
but occasionally , the system governed by the customer actually delivers the right outcome			2
now , in both cases , these men will be just fine			2
after a few months of soul - searching and apologies , @entity0 went on to land another tv and radio show , this time on @entity151			1
at 73 , he is still worth millions of dollars , and has led a @entity153 life largely free of drama			2
and @entity12 , 80 , will be just fine , too			2
the team he bought in 1981 for $ 12.5 million is now worth well over $ 575 million , according to @entity156			1
and his net worth has been reported at more than $ 1.9 billion			0
so , even after being slapped with a $ 2.5 million fine -- the maximum @entity99 could hit him with under @entity17 ownership rules -- @entity12 's net worth will still be about $ 1.8975 billion			1
he 's going to be alright			0
nevertheless , the real winners here are the players , the fans , the owners ( when they vote @entity164 out ) , and the process			1
in a free , fair and capitalistic democracy , where the decency of the @entity45 voice still has some power , this is exactly how it is supposed to work			0
join us on @entity176 / @entity175 .			0

@entity178 *compares* outcome of @entity164 saga with the firing of shock - jock @entity0
in both cases , he says , the system of outcry , pressure and advertiser action worked
@entity12 has been banned for life by the @entity17 , fined $ 2.5 million
@entity17 owners may force the sale of his team , the @entity13
