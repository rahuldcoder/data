protesters seething over their treatment by security forces hurled rocks at riot police in @entity6 's @entity5 on monday , the latest in a string of violent clashes that have punctuated massive anti-government demonstrations spreading across @entity10 -- leaving thousands injured and at least one dead in the past two days alone			1
the protests united demonstrators from across the political spectrum against a common foe : security forces who unleashed tear gas and water cannons on them in response to what had been largely peaceful protests against the government of prime minister @entity24			1
" there has been unprecedented violence against protesters and social protest , " demonstrator @entity25 said monday			2
the @entity30 claimed that at least 3,195 people had been injured in clashes sunday and monday			2
only 26 of them were in serious or critical condition , it said			2
one protester , @entity37 , died of his injuries , the association said			2
the association reported that the bulk of the injuries occurred in @entity42 , where the protests began before spreading to @entity6 , @entity44 , @entity45 and other locations			2
international groups including @entity48 have criticized the police response as excessive			0
in @entity6 sunday night , a @entity51 crew witnessed authorities roughing up at least one protester			0
one police officer kicked a @entity51 videographer , @entity51 's @entity56 reported , and a @entity51 crew in @entity42 sunday also witnessed bloodied protesters			2
@entity24 responded monday by dismissing the demonstrations as the work of " extreme elements " and said they would likely spark a backlash against the organizers			1
" my smart citizens will recognize this , then they will give them the right lesson , " he said			1
but @entity10 's president , @entity69 , took a somewhat more conciliatory tone monday , saying " the messages sent in good faith have been received			1
" " when we talk about a democracy , we of course mean the expression of the will of the people in electing the leaders of the country			0
but democracy does not just mean elections , " he said			0
" it is natural that outside of elections if there are differing opinion , situations or objections that they be voiced			0
and peaceful protests are a part of that			2
" the protests began after plans were made to raze @entity95 , the last green space in central @entity42 , and replace it with a replica of 19th - century @entity99 barracks			2
the development would contain a shopping mall			0
what began as a sit - in by a handful of angry residents quickly grew into a larger protest			0
riot police moved in , using tear gas and pepper spray			0
protesters responded by hurling bottles , setting up barricades , blocking bulldozers and burning trash in the middle of the street			2
then , outraged by the behavior of security forces , demonstrators began attacking police			0
the protests have since morphed into larger complaints against @entity24 , whom protesters call paternalistic and authoritarian			1
" this park was just the ignition of all that , " said @entity124 , a 28 - year - old demonstrator who carried a @entity10 flag while walking through the park saturday			1
in @entity42 , the crowds have been chanting " @entity134 resign " -- referring to @entity24 -- and " shoulder to shoulder against fascism			1
" the protests have spread to 67 of @entity10 's 81 provinces , according to the semi-official @entity137			1
on monday , a confederation of unions claiming some 240,000 members added its voice to the @entity143 chorus , saying it would go on strike against what it called the " fascism " of @entity24 's ruling party			1
on monday , @entity24 said opponents who had failed to defeat his party in elections were trying to beat it " by other means			1
" " the issue of trees in @entity95 thing is just the trigger , " he said			0
it 's one of the few sentiments that all sides appear to agree on			0
@entity160 , a @entity161 analyst at the @entity162 in @entity163 , said if the flashpoint had n't been the park , " it would have been caused by something else			0
" what you have is essentially a large group of @entity10 who feel alienated from this government , in power for 10 years , " @entity160 told @entity51			1
" it 's increasingly a one - party country			0
all the politics happen within it			0
the opposition is weak , divided , feckless			0
you have a lot of people in @entity10 who feel both alienated and intimidated by the government , and this is the way they decided to push back			1
" a day earlier , @entity24 was praising his government 's accomplishments overseeing a decade of unprecedented economic growth in @entity10 , and he defended his record as a leader who has planted many trees			1
" they are putting on airs , saying we massacre trees , " he said			0
" we have planted approximately 2 billion trees			0
" he also downplayed claims that @entity10 could be on the cusp of its own " @entity195 " -- the series of popular uprisings in @entity197 and the @entity161 that led to political upheaval in @entity199 and @entity200 , particularly			1
" those in @entity10 who speak of the @entity202 are right ; the season is , in fact , spring , " he said			1
" but there are those trying to turn it into a winter			0
" @entity209 , a columnist for @entity211 , said @entity24 is the most powerful and popular politician @entity10 has seen in generations			1
but his approach to leadership does n't sit well with all @entity10 , she said			1
" we have a prime minister who has done great deeds and he really has run the economy well , " she said			1
" but you also have this paternalistic style : ' i know what 's good for you			0
@entity223 , as your father , can decide on the park , the bridge , the city and the constitution			0
' so , i think people are just wanting to have a more inclusive form of democracy in @entity10			1
" @entity231 , a senior @entity10 analyst with the @entity232 , called the protests " completely unprecedented " and said @entity24 was caught off guard			1
most demonstrators , @entity231 said , are " overwhelmingly ordinary people " who simply want their voices heard			0
" however , there are other demonstrators who are somewhat more opportunistic in the left - wing factions who normally do n't get much in the way of airtime in @entity10 and are camped on @entity244 , " @entity231 said			2
" they have outposts where they are delivering their message , and in fact it has to be said that they are sometimes on the front line of the protestors in the fights against the police at the barricades , " he said .			0
