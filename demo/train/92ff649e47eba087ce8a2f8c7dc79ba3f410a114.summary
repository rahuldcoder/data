he got up from his seat during the half - time break in a soccer match to purchase a drink from the concession stand			2
" there she was , standing behind the bar , " he recounts , 58 years later			2
" it was love at first sight			0
" @entity0 asked the young woman out to a movie -- and the rest , they say , is history			0
it 's quite a shame , then , that @entity18 does n't remember any of this			1
or if she does , she ca n't say so			0
@entity18 is one of 152 residents at @entity21 , a cutting - edge elder care facility on the outskirts of @entity24 , the @entity25 , just minutes from downtown @entity26			1
' @entity27 ' - as it has become known -- is a place where residents can live a seemingly normal life , but in reality are being watched all the time			1
caretakers staff the restaurant , grocery store , hair salon and theater -- although the residents do n't always realize they are carers -- and are also watching in the residents ' living quarters			1
residents are allowed to roam freely around the courtyard - like grounds with its landscaped trees , fountains and benches -- but they ca n't leave the premises			1
their two - story dormitory - style homes form a perimeter wall for the village , meaning there is no way a resident can accidentally wander out			1
and if they do approach the one exit door , a staffer will politely suggest the door is locked and propose another route			0
elderly @entity60 try to avoid care homes placing an aging family member here is far less expensive than round - the - clock , in - home care			1
it also takes an enormous amount of stress off family members who do n't have ample time or proper training to care for their loved ones			1
@entity18 has received a diagnosis of severe dementia , meaning she requires attention and support 24 hours a day			1
that clinical indication is necessary to gain admittance into @entity21			0
the burden of caring for @entity18 eventually became unmanageable for @entity0 and his daughters , so together , they made the decision to place her here			0
he says : " it 's perfect			1
i would n't know a better place for her			0
it 's 100 % good			1
" nearly every day of the week , @entity0 drives 15 kilometers ( 10 miles ) each way to spend a few hours with his 80 - year - old wife			0
" i do it for myself , " he says			0
" i need it for myself			0
she ( still ) recognizes everyone ... so it 's important i be here every day			1
" although they ca n't chat with each other , @entity0 and @entity18 will often sit for hours , holding hands and lovingly look into each other 's eyes			1
every so often , @entity18 offers a smile , a laugh , a squeeze of the hand			0
at least part of her memory , it seems , is still intact , though she ca n't verbalize much these days			1
like other residents of @entity21 , @entity18 may not know exactly where she is , but she always feels right at home			1
that 's precisely the idea			2
for @entity111 , one of @entity21 's founders , the need to create the small village was deeply personal			1
" it was the moment my mother called me and told me my father had passed away suddenly , " she recalls			0
" nothing was wrong with him			0
he just had a heart attack and he died			0
one of the first things i thought was , ' thank @entity124 he never had to be in a nursing home			0
' that 's crazy that i have to think that ! i 'm in the management of a nursing home and i do n't want my father to come here			2
" five things @entity131 's dr. @entity130 learned at the center @entity134 sat down with her colleagues in november 1992 to discuss how they could transform the typical nursing home into more worthwhile living			1
they created a 1.5 hectare ( four - acre ) complex , completed in 2009 , that is home to 23 housing units and seven different " lifestyle themes , " such as crafts , culture , religious and urban			0
art lovers get paintings on the walls and music is always playing while the religious get more conservative d√©cor and christian crosses on the walls			0
the simple goal : provide the most normal possible life , reminiscent of each individual 's formative years			2
from the furnishing of her unit to the decorations and the type of food served , @entity18 is led to believe that nothing in her life has changed			0
it 's this sense of normalcy that they strive for day in and day out at @entity21			2
study finds loneliness linked to dementia in some ways , this is similar to the manufactured reality depicted in the movie " @entity174 , " where a man played by @entity176 discovers his entire life is actually a tv program			2
everything he thinks is real is in fact a mirage , created by television producers for the viewing public 's entertainment			2
@entity134 dismisses any accusations that she and her staff are duping their residents			1
" we have a real society here , " she says			0
" i do n't think people feel fooled			0
they feel fooled if we just tell them a story that 's not true and they know it			2
we 're not telling stories			0
" but telling stories is exactly what some of the residents do , all day long , including @entity18 's housemate , @entity200			1
like all of @entity21 's residents , @entity200 's dementia is rapidly progressing			1
her " loop " is getting shorter ; the conversations she carries and the questions she asks are becoming more repetitive in a shorter amount of time			0
" do you know @entity213 ? " she asks , multiple times over the course of an hour			0
of course , no one does , but each time she seems surprised that we have n't met			0
* @entity213 may be a relic of @entity200 's past , a distant , foggy memory of a baseball player she says lived with her for a short time when she was younger			1
or , he may be a figment of her imagination			0
sadly , we 'll never know			0
brain map seeks to unlock mysteries of the mind worldwide , 35.6 million people have dementia , according to the @entity231 , with 7.7 million new cases being diagnosed every year			2
at that rate , the number of people with dementia is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050			2
this will be an additional burden for governments already struggling to contain the runaway costs of health care			1
in @entity244 , everyone pays into the state health care system during their working years , with the money then disbursed to pay for later - in - life expenses - and that means living in @entity21 does not cost any more than a traditional nursing home			1
could this innovative model work in other countries ? health care industry leaders in @entity60 , @entity255 , @entity256 and @entity257 are all beginning to take notice			1
at @entity21 , says @entity270 , " we have @entity25 design , @entity25 cultures , @entity25 lifestyles , but the concept is to value the person , the individual ... to support them to live their life as usual , and you can do that anywhere			1
" on a physical level , residents at @entity21 require fewer medications ; they eat better , and yes , they live longer			2
on a mental level , they also seem to have more joy			0
it 's a difficult thing to measure , but that is the most important thing here at @entity21			2
so could this work in other parts of the world ? that 's the next question .			1

@entity25 dementia facility shows new way of providing long term care

living quarters are furnished to *reflect* a person 's younger days
health experts from across @entity297 and @entity257 are looking at the @entity25 model
