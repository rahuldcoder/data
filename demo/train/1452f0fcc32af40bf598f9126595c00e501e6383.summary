-- responding to the latest undercover video by an anti-abortion group , women 's reproductive health care provider @entity1 announced tuesday it will retrain more than 11,000 staff members at more than 800 centers across the @entity8			1
@entity1 has ordered " all health center staff and educators who have contact with patients and teens be retrained in understanding our policies and procedures for responding to situations that indicate that the welfare of a minor is endangered , " @entity9 , vice president for communications at @entity1 , said in a statement issued tuesday			1
the retraining will be completed by april 1 , @entity9 said			0
the announcement came in the wake of the anti-abortion group @entity27 's sixth undercover video of a @entity1 clinic that purportedly shows staff " willing to assist sex trafficking and exploitations of minors and young women , " group president @entity24 said in a written statement			1
affirming a zero tolerance policy tuesday , @entity1 said in a statement that employees will be fired in cases of confirmed failure to comply with the group 's procedures for situations involving endangered minors and with states ' mandatory reporting laws for underage girls			1
the @entity27 videos are reminiscent of those by right - wing videographer @entity50 , who targeted @entity51 , an organization that advocated for low - and middle - income people and worked to register voters			2
those videos purported to show a " pimp " and a " prostitute " asking for advice on setting up a brothel and evading taxes			1
@entity50 's videos were found in at least two investigations to be so heavily edited as to be an unreliable record of what happened , showing no evidence of any wrongdoing by @entity51 staff members			0
but those investigations were completed too late to save the organization			0
the @entity27 videos also appear to be heavily edited			2
all were apparently taped in january , when @entity1 says it learned of at least 11 undercover visits in six states over one week " in which persons claiming to be involved in sex trafficking with minors asked for services for young women			1
" @entity9 said he expects more @entity27 announcements about the other visits			2
@entity1 reported the visits to the @entity80 before any of @entity81 videos were released			2
like the prior ones , the latest secretly recorded video uses a couple portraying themselves as a pimp and a prostitute who are seeking abortions for underage girls			1
last week , @entity27 released undercover videos of four @entity1 health centers in @entity93 and one in @entity95			1
@entity1 officials fired a staff worker in the @entity95 office , but defended the others by saying they behaved professionally and appropriately reported the incidents to the @entity80			1
the latest video claims to show a @entity1 staffer and a supervisor in the @entity105 borough of @entity106 guiding the pimp and prostitute actors on how to get abortions for girls as young as 13			1
but the @entity105 video was " clearly doctored and can not be trusted , " @entity9 said			2
" the truth is that @entity27 has a history of doctoring video , making false claims and has no credibility , " @entity9 said in a statement			1
" this is a tactic similar to that of @entity50 , the discredited right - wing activist long associated with @entity27			2
" the edited @entity105 tape contains two or more video sources , as well as an additional audio source , increasing the opportunity for manipulation and selective editing , @entity9 said			0
unlike in the other publicized videos , the hoax visitors in the @entity105 were n't able to get past the reception desk for a private consultation , @entity9 said			0
the two @entity1 workers in the @entity105 told the @entity130 in an interview that " they did not hear the words ' sex work ' or ' sex worker ' uttered by the actors on camera , " @entity9 said			1
@entity130 spokeswoman @entity138 declined to comment on the ongoing controversy about the undercover videos			0
" i ca n't comment on something i have n't seen			0
i 'm unaware of which field office they are communicating with , " she said tuesday			0
@entity80 spokeswoman @entity144 said tuesday the @entity8 attorney general 's office received a letter last month from @entity1 alerting officials to the visits by the purported pimp and prostitute seeking abortions for minors			1
@entity144 declined to comment further			0
@entity9 described the undercover videos as " an effort to undermine the credibility of @entity1 staff in @entity27 's coordinated lobbying effort to support legislation that would bar @entity1 from receiving federal funds			1
" @entity160 is considering such a proposal , put forward by @entity162			2
rose of @entity27 said @entity1 's retraining program " is nothing more than window dress			1
" " @entity27 's investigation has uncovered a serious , institutional crisis in which @entity1 is willing to aid and abet sex trafficking and exploitation of minors and young women , " @entity24 said in a statement			1
@entity27 describes itself on its website as " a leading new media , investigative , and educational organization committed to the protection and respect of all human life			0
" @entity24 has said that her purpose in making the videos -- and making available the edited versions -- is to " take down " @entity1			0
@entity183 , president of @entity1 , said the 95 - year - old organization is the nation 's leading provider of reproductive health care and serves 3 million patients a year			2
one in five women has come to its health centers at some point in her lifetime , she said			0
" to further our commitment to our patients , we will continue to work to expand access to health care and coverage for women and oppose efforts , such as those currently before @entity160 , that would eliminate vital health care services that women and families need , " @entity183 said			0
officials with @entity1 of @entity106 said that if underage girls came into the center , " they would have met with a licensed social worker			0
" " all teens coming into @entity1 of @entity106 are screened for child abuse and neglect			0
all teens who disclose abuse meet with a licensed social worker , who records and reports the abuse , " the group said in a statement .			0
