-- the prospect of competing in the @entity2 left @entity5 rower @entity3 with a big dilemma			1
as a practicing @entity7 , @entity3 , who has @entity10 family , should be starting his month - long @entity11 fast on july 21 , abstaining from food and water during daylight hours			1
but it clashes with what should be the pinnacle of his career so far when he competes in the @entity5 men 's eight at the @entity23 on home water			1
" my faith is really important to me , " @entity3 said in an interview with @entity0 's @entity28 series			1
" i make sure i say the first verse of the @entity31 before every single race , whether it be out loud or in my head			0
" i spoke to my family here , spoke to my family back home in @entity10 , and at the end of the day i 'm making the right decision for me , and that 's to postpone my fast			1
" it is n't only his faith that will inspire him			0
the devoted @entity43 football fan will also turn to music to fire him up before he races			0
" i like to listen to quite violent hip - hop rap kinda of stuff before i get on the water , " he said			2
" i do listen to one song : @entity52 feat. @entity50 -- no love			0
" football fan born in @entity5 to an @entity56 mother and @entity10 father , @entity3 had one sport on his mind when he was 15 -- and it was n't rowing			1
@entity3 -- nicknamed " @entity68 " by his friends -- spent as much time as possible on the football pitch , but the visit of @entity5 rowing 's talent identification scouts to his school in @entity66 persuaded him to try a different pursuit			1
" i was n't really for the idea ... i just wanted to play football , " he said			0
" the coach that was testing at the time saw me and said , ' make sure that boy is there			0
' i had the raw parameters to be a really successful rower			2
" that same year , he won under - 15 gold at the @entity5 indoor championships and he went on to win bronze in the men 's four at the @entity83			1
hitting the heights now the 24 - year - old is preparing to compete in his first @entity23 -- and he should n't be too hard to spot			1
at six foot eight inches ( 2.03 meters ) , @entity3 is the tallest member of the @entity5 eight -- although his physique is not unusual in rowing			1
" if i was n't a rower , i 'd love to be a basketball player			2
i love basketball , i love watching it , " he said			0
" and basketball you kind of fit in			0
it 's the same thing with rowing , you just sit here and everyone is tall			1
and you 're like , ' is this the land of the giants ? ' " size matters being the biggest member of a crew is not necessarily an advantage , @entity3 says , so keeping his weight down is crucial			1
" when it comes to summer racing i 'm the biggest guy -- i can also easily be the heaviest guy			0
by me being lighter , and keeping the same power , it would be beneficial to the crew			2
" gold target @entity3 moved up to the eight crew in 2010 , having raced in the pair and the four at youth level , and @entity5 looks set to renew its rivalry with @entity119 at the @entity120			1
the @entity5 eight finished second behind the dominant @entity119 at the 2010 and @entity121			2
however , @entity3 is n't interested in collecting another silver medal			2
" i 'm in this to win , " he said			0
" i only want one thing and that is an @entity23 medal			0
i went four years not winning anything and if i just win that gold medal ... i 'll be happy			0
my legacy would be that gold medal			0
" @entity5 's rowing legends if he does win gold , @entity3 will follow in the footsteps of some of the biggest names in @entity5 rowing			1
@entity137 won titles at five successive @entity23 , while @entity139 won four in a row and @entity141 won gold in the coxless four in 2000 and 2004			0
" @entity145 , @entity141 and @entity137 they were able to do that for 20 years , 16 years and 12 years , " @entity3 says			2
" that 's pretty impressive			2
it 's unimaginable for me to be able to try to better @entity137			0
