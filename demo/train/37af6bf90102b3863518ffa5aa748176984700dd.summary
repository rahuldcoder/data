-- every move scrutinized , every word analyzed : life in the electoral spotlight where a clothes selection can be as much a defining moment as policies espoused			1
@entity8 entered @entity10 's life after his return from the @entity12			1
this is life - not for the presumptive presidential nominees sen. @entity15 and sen. @entity10 - but for their respective wives			2
@entity17 has already been in the firing line - accused of being angry , negative and " unpatriotic " with growing concerns she will be the target of ever more intensive attacks by conservatives as the election battle heats up			1
for sen. @entity10 the attacks could come on two fronts - confined not just to his current spouse , the striking , elegant heiress @entity8 , but those rooted in his own marital history and the other mrs. @entity8 before her - a woman of more modest means who is now virtually invisible			1
the first mrs. @entity8 was born @entity30			1
she was also a beauty in her youth but after their marriage she suffered a terrible misfortune			0
in 1969 , while @entity10 was a prisoner of war in @entity37 , @entity30 was badly disfigured in a car accident			1
she underwent such drastic surgery to rebuild her body that she ended up several inches shorter and a good deal heavier			0
for years , she struggled to recover and raise their three children but kept it secret from her @entity47 husband to avoid adding to his ordeal			0
he did n't find out until he was released and they were reunited , in 1973 , but the marriage soon ran into trouble			0
he was 42 and @entity8 was 24 when she became the woman with whom he would make a new life			1
he separated from his wife within months			2
in his memoirs , @entity8 writes that their break - up was caused by his " selfishness and immaturity " ...			2
" the blame was entirely mine			0
" @entity30 does n't often talk to the media but she does n't think her accident or injuries ended her marriage			2
she told one biographer " i attribute it more to @entity10 turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than i do to anything else			0
" by all accounts , she got a generous divorce settlement and they remain on good terms			0
it 's an old story to the @entity74 press corps and one that has been largely overlooked in the course of the campaign			0
whether history encourages impartial observers to see @entity8 in a positive light ; as a man who has publicly accepted his personal shortcomings ; or more negatively , as a man who left a long suffering spouse for a young heiress , the bigger issue is whether his marital history could or should play a part in determining his credentials to become president			1
and for that matter - the actions and words of a current spouse for either candidate .			0

life in the spotlight for the wives of the candidates may play a number of ways
