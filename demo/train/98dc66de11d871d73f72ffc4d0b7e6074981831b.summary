just months after president @entity1 was described by his own advisers as a " bear " on the loose , there are few midterm sightings of the man once dubbed the " campaigner in chief " by his @entity7 adversaries			1
the president has spent much of the 2014 cycle behind closed doors , either cloistered inside the @entity13 cocoon dealing with a seemingly endless series of crises and scandals , or at private fundraisers , urging donors to write checks to top @entity21 campaign and political action committees			1
tough road for @entity21 to keep the @entity24 that political calendar will evolve somewhat as @entity27 draws near , a @entity13 official told @entity28			1
for starters , the president will appear at events with @entity21 candidates in the coming weeks , the official said			1
@entity1 will make the argument for policies aimed at middle class voters , just as he did in last week 's speech on the economy in @entity38			2
" the president has already succeeded in making a pretty aggressive case about why that 's important for the country , and i would anticipate that in the context of the upcoming elections you 'll hear the president make that case again , " @entity13 press secretary @entity39 said			2
@entity46 criticizes @entity1 on @entity47 : ' we waited too long ' even though the @entity13 is not quite ready to announce @entity1 's upcoming campaign stops , there are a few states that can be crossed off the map			2
races in @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , where incumbent @entity21 senators face uphill battles to win reelection , remain at the top of the @entity1 no - go list			1
" there are definitely deeply red states in play this cycle where it wo n't make sense to send the president , " a @entity13 official said			1
@entity21 senator ca n't judge @entity1 's @entity72 handling so far , @entity1 is also avoiding crucial @entity24 races in states where he won decisive victories in the past			1
the @entity13 has yet to signal any plans to send the president to @entity79 , a critical battleground he captured twice : in 2008 and 2012			0
instead , first lady @entity81 will travel to @entity79 friday to appear with @entity21 congressman @entity82 , who remains locked in a close race with state sen. @entity84 for the seat vacated by liberal stalwart @entity86			2
" we defer to the campaigns who know their states best how to win , " a @entity13 official said			2
can lame ducks fly ? advice for @entity1 on his last two years another sign of @entity1 's drag on his party 's midterm hopes can be found in @entity97 , a critical @entity1 victory in 2008 that he and his party failed to translate into a more lasting @entity21 incursion into southern red states in the years that followed			1
despite @entity97 's potentially strong base of @entity21 support from african - americans and countless college - aged voters , @entity1 has become a major obstacle for the state 's endangered incumbent sen. @entity109			1
her opponent , state house speaker @entity111 , repeatedly tried to link @entity109 to the president during a debate tuesday in the state 's prosperous @entity115 area			0
" i think it 's fair to make this election about his policies , " @entity111 said in the debate			0
@entity122 plays savior for @entity55 @entity21 that remark was a reminder of a comment made by @entity1 at a speech on the economy last week in @entity38 : " these policies are on the ballot -- every single one of them , " the president said			1
his long - time adviser , @entity133 , called that part of the speech a " mistake			0
" @entity137 , a spokesman for @entity139 house speaker @entity138 and a midterm strategist for the @entity141 , described the @entity1 factor as " huge " in tuesday 's debate			2
" her worst moments in the debate were when she refused to distance herself from the president , " @entity137 said of @entity109			0
poll : in @entity24 race , libertarian could be spoiler a key @entity21 operative , who asked to speak on condition of anonymity , said inserting @entity1 into crucial campaign contests carries some risk			1
not only does the president 's unpopularity drive up enthusiasm among conservatives , the strategist said			0
it may encourage some moderate @entity21 to stay home			0
" even @entity1 supporters , they 're disappointed in him , " the strategist said			0
" we ca n't find a way to motivate them			0
" the first lady , vice president @entity169 , and @entity122 and @entity170 are seen as better alternatives			0
will same - sex marriage become a 2014 issue ? even though @entity169 has spent the last several days calling leaders in the @entity175 to clarify his comments that appeared to suggest @entity178 nations were partly responsible for the rise of @entity47 , the vice president appears to be in demand among @entity21			1
" so what if he f * * * ed up ? " one @entity21 strategist said , noting the party 's base is attracted to the vice president 's " @entity184 " shoot - from - the - lip style			2
@entity169 just wrapped up an event on tuesday with @entity189 , a congressional candidate in @entity190			0
he is scheduled to appear with @entity21 sen. @entity191 of @entity192 on wednesday			0
six times @entity169 aimed for the truth and caused a headache the one campaign setting where the president appears to thrive are fundraisers			0
a @entity13 official provided a list of approximately 50 fundraisers where @entity1 has spoken to @entity21 donors this year			1
his events this week in @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity38 generated between $ 2 - 3 million , @entity21 sources said .			0

president @entity1 is set to hit the trail for @entity21 candidates
the 2014 midterm elections take place in less than four weeks
he wo n't be going to some deeply red states , an official says
he has *largely* been off the trail because of his low *job* approval numbers
