@entity0 -- @entity2 plans to unveil a service called @entity4 on thursday that indicates @entity2 wants to do with your telephone communications what companies such as @entity8 have done with e-mail			1
@entity2 unveils a phone service thursday in which the search giant acts like a phone middleman			1
@entity4 , the new version of the @entity4 technology @entity2 acquired in july 2007 , has the potential to make the search giant a middleman in an important part of people 's lives , telephone communications			1
with the service , people can pick a new phone number from @entity4 ; when others call it , @entity2 can ring all the actual phones a person uses and handle voice mail			1
the old version could let people centralize telephone services , screen their calls , and listen to voice mail over the @entity34			0
but the new version offers several significant new features , though			0
@entity2 now uses its speech - to - text technology to transcribe voice mail , making it possible to search for particular words			1
@entity42 's contacts now is used to instruct @entity4 how to treat various callers			2
and @entity4 now can send and receive @entity45 text messages and set up conference calls			1
existing @entity4 users should get the option to upgrade thursday , and @entity2 plans to offer it to the public after " a number of weeks , " said @entity52 , product manager of real - time communications and head of @entity4			1
as interesting as the service itself , perhaps , is that @entity2 plans to offer it at no cost			1
@entity2 is in the midst of a profitability push , trying to wring more money from existing sites , adding advertisements to properties such as @entity65 , @entity66 , and @entity67 that previously lacked them , and canceling many projects such as @entity70 that did n't pass financial muster			2
with @entity4 , though , the company is showing more of its earlier , more patient approach			1
" our goal is to be able to offer it to people for free , " @entity52 said in an interview at @entity2 's offices here			1
asked what the revenue model is for @entity4 , he offered only an indirect answer : " let 's get a bunch of happy users engaged in @entity2 properties and getting their voice mail through this			1
@entity2 gets value out of having happy @entity2 users			1
" money is n't completely absent from the picture			0
the company does charge for international calls , and it would n't rule out advertising in the future			0
@entity4 has appeared largely dormant from the outside since the @entity2 acquisition , leading some to spotlight it as an example of a promising technology that was squelched by an acquisition			1
but , @entity52 said , there was plenty of work going on behind the scenes			0
" in addition to innovation , there 's been a process of getting migrated and integrating with the @entity2 infrastructure , " he said			2
one big possible difficulty for people could be the issue of changing phone numbers			0
people 's phone numbers can form a piece of their identity , in particular with home phone numbers held for years and number portability making it possible for people to keep their mobile phone numbers even if they change carriers			2
even leaving aside the issue of the hassle of changing phone numbers , sharing your @entity4 number means committing your telephony to @entity2 's services			1
another possible hitch is offering phone numbers that match where people actually live or work			0
here , @entity2 hopes to have things under control , though there were no numbers in the 415 area code for my test of the service			1
" our goal is to offer numbers to virtually everyone who wants to sign up			2
there are a finite number of numbers in the @entity150 , but we have n't reached anywhere near depletion , " @entity52 said			0
" we hope to have a pretty good footprint ( for area code choices ) so that people will have really good choices			0
" @entity4 , hands on overall , i found @entity4 to be potentially useful , with the most compelling option the imperfect but still very useful transcription			2
the first promise of @entity4 is to simplify your phone communications			1
you do n't have to worry about which number to hand out to people , and if you 're sitting with your cell phone next to you home or work phone , you can choose which to answer			2
if you have the " screen calls " option enabled , @entity4 will tell ask you if you want to accept the call or send the person to voice mail			1
( @entity4 asks first - time callers to identify themselves			1
) in practice , virtualizing your profusion of real - world phone numbers with one that redirects is handy			2
you can set various preferences -- for example , calls from your family members get a custom answering message ; calls from your parents do n't ring your work number ; and calls from your spouse are answered directly when you pick up the phone rather than run through the @entity4 options such as answering the call , sending it to voice mail , or listening in on the voice mail			1
but i thought @entity4 's most promising aspect is voice mail transcription			1
today , voice mail is a something of black hole for me			0
it 's a pain to check , and i just tell people to send me an e-mail if they get my voice mail			0
when i 'm on the road or at home , i check my e-mail much more frequently than my voice mail			0
and e-mail means i have their contact information and a record that they contacted me , all in a handy form that shows up through search			0
transcription brings some of these advantages to voice mail			0
because @entity4 e-mails you the text as soon as it 's ready , you can quickly scan it to see if it 's important			1
that 's a lot less obtrusive than calling your voice mail system in the middle of a meeting			0
also , reading the text lets you quickly home in on the caller 's phone number without having to wait through the whole message			1
on clever phones such as the @entity231 or @entity232 , the phone number is highlighted in the e-mail so you can click it to call back , too			2
however , the text - to - speech conversion is imperfect , to say the least -- for example , it thought " @entity238 and @entity239 " was " @entity240			1
" and here 's an amusing sample of one transcribed voice mail i left myself : " hey i 'm just testing the grand central transcription service to see if it really can do a good tax to speech recognition and that they believe in bed that 's little voicemail and a web page because what would not be exciting what time you get in bed a voicemail on the web page			1
" the web site uses bolder type for words it 's more sure of , so you can make better guesses about @entity52 said it takes roughly 30 seconds to translate a 30 - second voice mail , which is pretty good turnaround			2
my timing test of a rambling , 1:45 voice mail took just almost exactly twice that time to show up translated in my inbox , though the voice version was available over the @entity4 web site almost immediately			2
shallow @entity42 integration you do n't need a @entity42 account to use @entity4 -- any @entity2 account will do -- but if you have one , you can customize the system 's behavior for existing groups or individuals			1
when a message from an unknown number arrives , you can save it with the caller 's name through the @entity4 interface , and it will show up in your @entity42 contacts , too			2
a " contacts " tab at @entity4 borrows heavily on the @entity42 contacts tab			0
however , @entity2 left me wanting deeper integration			0
where are @entity42 's filters and labels ? @entity4 is a big step toward the long - promised utopia of unified communications , but instead it presents me with a new inbox to check			2
when i asked @entity52 whether @entity4 would be unified with @entity42 more thoroughly , he would n't say , but indicated it 's on @entity2 's to - do list			1
" there are a host of things we 're working on , " @entity52 said			0
" we want to get the core telephony from @entity4 to @entity4 , to get that ironed out first			0
" even where there is integration , for example with the @entity42 contacts page , there are some shortcomings			0
for example , i have a @entity42 mailing list for " family , " and i doubt i 'm not the only one			0
my wife is a member of the list , but @entity4 by default opted to use the settings for its " friends " category			0
apparently the reason for the issue is that @entity4 is case - sensitive : it created its own " family " group , with an uppercase f , that has no members in it			2
changing my existing group to " family " in @entity42 merely created two groups with that name , so to work around the issue i copied all the " family " members to " family			0
" i deleted the original to avoid the messy annoyance of keeping the two identical groups synchronized			0
tussling with carriers ? another interesting possibility , given @entity2 's @entity340 expertise and @entity4 's web - based interface , would be to offer direct calling using @entity344 ( voice over @entity346 )			1
@entity4 already has the potential to shift some of the customer relationship and valuable services from phone service companies to @entity2 , and offering voip service would increase that potential			1
@entity52 would n't comment that possibility , though he did point out that @entity4 can work with the @entity355 service			2
for the regular public switched telephone network , people still have to spend money with @entity360 , @entity361 , @entity362 , @entity363 , and others			0
" the point was to allow your existing services to work better together , " @entity52 said			0
" you have to come with your own underlying phones and services for it to work			0
