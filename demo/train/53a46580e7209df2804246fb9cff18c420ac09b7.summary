@entity6 the praise and challenges that accompany president @entity10 's @entity9			1
@entity11 's @entity12 ? - discuss how the international space station could become an abandoned laboratory transcript this is a @entity17			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity21 , @entity22 : it 's @entity24 ! some interesting info on that , just part of what you will find on @entity0 today			1
what you will not find are commercials			2
i 'm @entity33 , let 's get started			1
first up : @entity35 @entity36 : first up , a rescue mission ends a 22 - hour standoff between militants and government forces in @entity3			1
all this started on saturday with an attack on an army post in @entity44 , which claimed the lives of six guards and five gunmen			2
militants then took control of the army headquarters			2
they held dozens of people hostage and threatened to blow up the building			2
that sparked the standoff that lasted nearly a full day			1
@entity3 officials say they were in communication with the militants throughout the ordeal			1
on sunday morning , the situation came to a close when @entity3 forces carried out a rescue operation that freed a total of 39 hostages			1
the militant who led the assault on the army facility was also captured			2
and according to one @entity3 military official , the @entity67 said it was responsible for the attack			1
@entity71 @entity72 , @entity22 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm an award that was first established in 1901			2
i 'm given at an annual ceremony in @entity78 , @entity79 on december 10			2
some of my winners include @entity81 , @entity82 and the @entity83			2
i 'm the @entity84 , named for a @entity86 chemist and engineer named @entity88			2
@entity89 @entity36 : and the winner of this year 's @entity84 : president @entity10 ! the announcement came last friday and it came as a surprise to some people , including the president himself , who said he considers the award a " call to action			1
" the reaction , both from around the @entity100 and around the world , has been mixed			0
@entity103 has more on the award and the response			0
( @entity106 ) @entity100 president @entity10 : good morning			1
@entity108 : yes , he can win the @entity84 on the same day his war council met again to consider sending up to 40,000 more troops to @entity112 , while a second war is winding down but still raging in @entity114			0
fresh reminders this award is more about the promise of change than actual change			0
@entity10 : we have to confront the world as we know it today			1
i am the commander in chief of a country that 's responsible for ending a war and working in another theater to confront a ruthless adversary that directly threatens the @entity100 people and our allies			1
@entity108 : the @entity132 cited the president 's ability to create a new climate around the world			1
a deliberate approach from day one to break from the @entity138 years , especially with an historic speech to the @entity141 world in @entity142			0
@entity10 : and i 'm also proud to carry with me the goodwill of the @entity100 people and a greeting of peace from @entity141 communities in my country			1
@entity108 : as well as major speeches in @entity151 and at the @entity152 , laying out an aggressive plan to rid the world of nuclear weapons			0
@entity10 : all nations have the right to peaceful nuclear energy			1
that nations with nuclear weapons have a responsibility to move toward disarmament , and those without them have the responsibility to forsake them			0
@entity108 : but so far , only great speeches , with little tangible results			0
@entity168 , @entity169 : i think , certainly , you have to give him an a for trying , but at the end of the day , what has he accomplished ? @entity108 : not to mention the details of other accomplishments are still a little , well , fuzzy			0
@entity10 : i ordered the prison at @entity178 closed , and we are doing the hard work of forging a framework to combat extremism within the rule of law			1
@entity108 : top administration officials now admit they 'll likely miss the january deadline of closing @entity178 , a prime example of the difficulty of translating the president 's vision into some actual victories			1
@entity103 , @entity0 , @entity191			0
( @entity192 ) two issues @entity36 : okay , president @entity10 is getting some advice on one of the challenges mentioned in that report : the @entity197			1
a top @entity100 commander has reportedly requested 40,000 additional troops for the conflict			0
sen. @entity201 says not following that recommendation would be " an error of historic proportions			0
" yesterday , @entity0 's @entity205 asked senator @entity201 about his biggest concerns when it comes to @entity112			1
@entity205 , @entity208 , @entity209 : do you think the @entity100 can win in @entity112 with fewer than 40,000 more troops ? sen. @entity201 , ( r ) @entity212 : i do not			0
and i think the great danger now is not an @entity100 pullout			0
i think the great danger now is a half measure			0
sort of a , try to please all ends of the political spectrum			0
@entity36 : and the issue of gay rights gaining attention this weekend as the @entity223 took place in @entity191 yesterday			0
thousands of demonstrators took part , demanding full equality under the law			0
the day before , president @entity10 had addressed the nation 's largest gay rights group			1
during his speech , he talked about protection against hate crimes , his support for the rights of gay couples , and his pledge to end the ban on gays in the @entity100 military , what 's known as the " @entity243 " policy			1
fast facts @entity245 , @entity22 : time for some @entity246 ! the first @entity24 was celebrated in @entity247 in 1792 to mark the 300th anniversary of the explorer 's first voyage to @entity100			1
it 's been observed every year since 1920 , and features parades and ceremonies around the country			1
for decades , many states celebrated @entity24 on october 12 , because that 's when @entity257 landed in the @entity258			1
but in 1971 , @entity24 became a federal @entity100 holiday			0
and now , it 's always celebrated on the second monday of october , which makes today @entity24 ! @entity11 's future ? @entity36 : from an @entity263 - bound explorer to exploration in the skies			1
the first part of the international space station was put in orbit back in 1998			1
since then , modules and laboratories have been added , all with the goal of creating this massive research center to conduct science experiments			0
the only problem , as @entity274 explains , is that it may never happen			0
( begin video ) @entity277 , @entity278 : more than a decade of construction			0
the @entity100 cost alone , including shuttle flights : $ 44 billion			0
that 's right , billion with a b , and still counting			1
now , after all that time and money , the international space station is ready to do world - class science			1
the problem is , it may be scuttled before it ever has the chance			0
@entity289 , @entity290 chief engineer : the general idea that we would spend approximately 11 years building a space station , get it to its full operational capability and then kind of abandon it a few years later , to me personally , it does n't make a lot of sense			1
@entity302 : that 's exactly what might happen			1
funding to keep the station in orbit will run out by 2015			1
the promise of cures for diseases like @entity311 's and @entity312 's and ground - breaking research may never be realized			1
@entity314 , chairman , @entity316 : we think that you ca n't do them on @entity263			0
that the bias of gravity is so extreme that you really need to take it out of a gravitational influence and start doing these things in space			2
it 's probably the only place to get these done			2
@entity302 : @entity328 ' company is already reaping the benefits			0
a salmonella vaccine developed in space is moving through the @entity332 for approval			2
the last shuttle flight carried an experiment aimed at producing a vaccine for @entity337 , a highly - resistant staph infection			2
the absence of gravity allows for the rapid growth of very virulent bacteria , perfect for building vaccines , says @entity328			0
@entity343 : that process on @entity263 is extremely long			0
it can take up to 10 years to do if they get it at all , and we 've sent it up to space for really three trips and we found that we already had a vaccine for salmonella just after three trips			2
@entity302 : during its construction , the station has been used for some experiments , but not the kind that might produce miracle drugs and cures			2
even if the station 's life is extended , the science community acknowledges there are no guarantees the football field - sized flying laboratory will produce great breakthroughs			1
and getting funding for a " maybe " is tough			0
still , the station 's backers say funding to keep it flying is a no brainer			1
you do n't spend a fortune on a house , they say , and then abandon it			0
so the question is , is the hope of great science , not the promise , enough for the @entity10 administration to keep the lights on ? @entity274 , @entity0 , @entity383			1
( @entity384 ) before we go @entity36 : well , it 's a question you can answer too			2
should the @entity388 be grounded ? we 'd love for you to weigh in with your thoughts on our blog			0
you can find that , you know where , on our blog at @entity394			0
now before we go today , anyone hungry for a snack ? guess it 's time for a trip to the vending machine and some delicious ... apples ? apples ! that 's the whole point of these new products , which replace chocolate and chips with fruits and veggies			2
the goal is to help hungry folks make healty choices			0
and the company guarantees that the fresh foods wo n't go bad too quickly			0
goodbye @entity36 : you might think that fact would be ripe for a pun , it 's just a good thing we could produce something that met our usual standards			2
but would you really want apples over chocolate ? i mean it is healthier , but c'mon			0
really ? for @entity0 , i 'm @entity33			0
make the healthy news choice			0
join us again tomorrow when we return .			0
