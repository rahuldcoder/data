editor 's note : @entity2 is the director of media relations at the @entity4			1
@entity2 says cigarettes kill more people than drugs that are illegal			1
@entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- cigarettes kill ; 400,000 people die prematurely every year from smoking			1
when we analyze the harm from drugs , there is no doubt that cigarettes are the worst			1
they kill more people than cocaine , heroin , methamphetamine and all other illegal drugs combined			1
more than 800,000 people are arrested every year for marijuana , the vast majority for possession , yet all the data from studies that compare the two substances show that cigarettes are more harmful to an individual 's health			1
if we make these other drugs illegal , should n't we outlaw the leading killer ? considering how we deal with less harmful drugs , making cigarettes illegal seems logical			1
over the past decade , we have seen , in states from @entity40 to @entity8 , increasing restrictions on when and where people can smoke -- and even momentum toward tobacco prohibition			2
smoking is banned in bars and restaurants and on some university campuses			0
people can now be fired from their jobs because they ca n't give up smoking			0
we have seen parents denied adoption rights if they smoke			0
in some cities , it is nearly impossible to smoke anywhere besides your own home			0
the @entity4 sponsored a @entity60 in 2006 , and we were shocked to find that 45 percent of those polled supported making cigarettes illegal within the next 10 years			1
among 18 - to 29 - year - olds , it 's more than 50 percent			2
but with all of the good intentions in the world , outlawing cigarettes would be just as disastrous as the prohibition on other drugs			1
after all , people would still smoke , just as they still use other drugs that are prohibited , from marijuana to cocaine			1
but now , in addition to the harm of smoking , we would find a whole range of " collateral consequences " that come along with prohibition			0
a huge number of people who smoke would continue to do so , but now they would be considered criminals			0
we would have parents promising their kids that they will stop smoking but still sneaking a smoke			0
we would have smokers hiding their habit and smoking in alleys and dark corners , afraid of being caught using the illegal substance			2
we would have cops using precious time and resources to hassle and arrest cigarette smokers			0
our prison overcrowding crisis would rise to an unprecedented level with " addicts " and casual cigarette smokers alike getting locked up			0
we would have a black market , with outlaws taking the place of delis and supermarkets and stepping in to meet the demand and provide the desired drug			0
instead of buying your cigarettes in a legally sanctioned place , you would have to hit the streets to pick up your fix			2
the cigarette trade would provide big revenue to " drug dealers , " just as illegal drugs do today			1
there would be shootouts in the streets and killings over the right to sell the prohibited tobacco plant			2
we have tried prohibiting cigarettes in some state prisons , like in @entity40 , and we have seen that smoking continues , with cigarettes traded illicitly			1
there is a violent black market that fills the void and leads to unnecessary deaths over access and the inflated profits			0
luckily , no one is proposing making cigarettes illegal			1
on the contrary , our public health campaign around cigarettes has been a model of success compared with our results with other prohibited drugs			1
by placing high taxes on cigarettes , restricting locations where one can smoke and banning certain kinds of advertising , we have seen a significant decline in the number of people who smoke			2
instead of giving teens " reefer madness " - style propaganda , we have treated young people with respect and given them honest education about the harm of cigarettes , and we have been rewarded with fewer young people smoking today than ever before			0
although we should celebrate our success and continue to encourage people to cut back or give up smoking , let 's not get carried away and think that prohibition would eliminate smoking			0
we need to realize that drugs , from cigarettes to marijuana to alcohol , will always be consumed , whether they are legal or illegal			1
although drugs have health consequences and dangers , making them illegal -- and keeping them illegal -- will only bring additional death and suffering			1
do n't just take my word for it			0
take it from the news anchor who was called the most trusted man in @entity178 , @entity177			2
here is what he said about prohibition and our war on drugs : " i covered the @entity185			0
i remember the lies that were told , the lives that were lost -- and the shock when , 20 years after the war ended , former defense secretary @entity189 admitted he knew it was a mistake all along			0
... " and i can not help but wonder how many more lives , and how much more money , will be wasted before another @entity189 admits what is plain for all to see : the war on drugs is a failure			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : cigarettes kill 400,000 @entity178 a year
he says the toll is heavier than for drugs like marijuana that are illegal
he says *anti-smoking* campaigns are effective without prohibiting tobacco
@entity2 : @entity211 causes additional death and suffering
