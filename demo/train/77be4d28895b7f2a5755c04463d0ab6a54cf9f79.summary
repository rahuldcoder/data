-- @entity1 unveiled a collection of new @entity4 devices in @entity5 , @entity6 , on thursday			2
there were two dedicated e-readers and three @entity10 tablets , ranging in price from $ 69 to $ 499			1
after chief executive @entity13 finished his presentation , journalists were given some hands - on time with the new devices			1
here are our first impressions : 7 - inch @entity20 and @entity10 there are a few new members of the @entity10 family , one at every popular tablet price point			1
there are two new 7 - inch devices , the $ 159 @entity10 and $ 199 @entity20			1
@entity13 also announced a pair of higher - end , faster @entity20 devices , both 8.9 - inches , but they were not available for a demonstration			1
the @entity32 model costs $ 499 , the regular model $ 299			2
the two 7 - inch @entity10 tablets look similar , but the hd has a few more features			1
available in @entity37 or @entity38 , the @entity20 has a higher resolution screen of 1280 - by - 800 pixels , @entity42 powered speakers , stronger @entity43 and better battery life			1
it also manages to weigh a smidgen less than the @entity10			2
kindle hd vs. @entity47 : a comparison the exterior designs are slick and minimalist , similar to the new @entity50 , featuring a black body and no buttons			1
photos , videos and books all look great on the hd 's glossy screen and very nice on the @entity10 's screen			2
navigating on both devices is a snap			2
the operating system is a heavily reworked version of @entity62 , custom - made by @entity1			1
an oft - repeated theme at the event was that @entity1 is focusing on the service , not the gadgets			1
it hopes to make money from its rich ecosystem of content , not the sales of hardware			2
the company makes no secret that the @entity10 is essentially a tool on which the company would like to sell you things , which is why the blatant attempts to point you toward new purchases do n't feel so much intrusive as , well , helpful			2
for example , turning the device into portrait mode makes room for custom suggestions			2
below the icon for an app is a selection of apps other customers also bought			0
same for a book or movie			0
if you 're looking at the thumbnail for a website , you 'll see other sites that are " trending now			0
" this soft sell is also present in the new x-ray feature for movies , which allows you to hit pause and automatically see @entity102 profiles for actors in the flick , finding out what else they 've appeared in			0
this list of other movies is great for settling arguments , and you can also click to buy them from @entity1 or add them to your watch list for future purchasing			0
@entity1 announces new wave of @entity115 one very interesting new feature just for the @entity10 is @entity117 , which allows you to listen to the audiobook version of a title , while the corresponding words are highlighted in the @entity4 version			0
this would be great for learning a language or for kids who are just learning how to read			0
an update to an older feature , @entity126 , combines the two versions , so you can switch between listening to and reading a book without losing your place			0
unfortunately , you will need to purchase both versions of the books individually to take advantage of the tools			0
speed still appears to be an issue on the the 7 - inch @entity20			1
after tapping on an app or a photo , there 's a bit of lag time before you 're taken to your destination			1
it 's the same if you flip too quickly through a magazine or book			0
this came up on the @entity20 and the @entity10 across a variety of apps and media			0
it was n't noticeable while streaming videos , which played smoothly and looked crisp and seamless on both devices			0
the @entity10 and @entity20 will start shipping on september 14 , and the 8.9 - inch @entity157 will ship on november 20			1
@entity158 it may not be the most expensive or feature - filled product announced thursday by @entity1 , but the @entity158 could be the most impressive complete package			1
one of the most persistent complaints about the @entity4 has been that it lacked a light			1
for people who were used to using smartphones in the dark , the @entity4 was a little too much like a real book			0
the @entity158 addresses that problem with what the company calls a " front - lit " display			1
the result is rather stunning			1
the effect is subtle , more of an all - over soft glow than a bright computer , tablet screen or a directional light			1
when you first look , you might not even notice it 's on , just that the text looks cleaner , crisper and easy on the eyes			0
the light is meant to be left on at all times , but the brightness should be adjusted depending on how much light you need			1
even in a bright environment , the light greatly improves how text displays on the screen			2
one of the @entity4 's biggest advantages over traditional tablets as an e-reading device is its impressive battery life			2
@entity1 claims that even with the new light on , the @entity158 will get up to eight weeks of battery life			1
the visual improvement extends to the touch screen , which has a higher resolution , 212 pixels per inch			2
and the background has been tweaked to be whiter , the text blacker			0
the @entity203 were on display in a brightly lit airplane hangar , so it was difficult to see how the light would look in a dark environment			1
the screen is the real star , but the outside has a few changes as well			0
there are no buttons anymore , and the body is black and thinner than the @entity216			0
tapping the screen to advance to the next page could take a bit of getting used to for those of us accustomed to buttons on the sides of older kindles			0
there are some nice changes to the user interface that solve small problems			0
a time is now displayed at the bottom of the screen telling you how much reading time is left for a book			0
if you encounter a character in a book and ca n't remember who they are , the new x-ray feature pops up again to lend a hand			0
the tool will show you everywhere else the person 's name has appeared in the book , chapter or page			0
the improvements are n't drastic or flashy , but they are small changes that show a company paying attention to how its customers use the product and trying to perfect the user experience			0
the @entity158 costs $ 119 , or $ 179 if you opt for the 3g version			1
it ships on october 1			0
kindle the biggest change for the bare - bones @entity4 e-reader is its price , which was dropped from $ 79 to $ 69			1
the mono - tasking device is the cheapest in the @entity4 lineup , and it is the most similar to a paper book -- inexpensive , light , with an e-ink screen but no lighting			1
there are a few very minor changes to the ad - supported device			2
the body of the @entity4 is now black instead of gray , but the buttons and ports are all in the same locations			0
there are some new font options , and the company claims it has 15 % faster page turns			0
the new @entity4 is available to order now and starts shipping on september 14 .			1

the new @entity158 e-reader features a " front - lit " light that is subtle and stunning
new 7 - inch kindle fire tablets are *attractive* and *intuitive* but still lag at times
most new tablets will start shipping later in september and can be ordered now
