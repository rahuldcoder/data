@entity0 -- the case against @entity4 neighborhood watch volunteer @entity3 -- which has , for the last several weeks , been exhaustively tried in the court of public opinion -- is now headed where it belongs : to a court of law			1
special prosecutor @entity11 announced wednesday that @entity3 would be charged with second - degree murder in the tragic death of unarmed 17 - year - old @entity14			1
the 28 - year - old @entity3 , who had been in hiding even from his own attorneys , turned himself in to authorities and is in police custody awaiting a hearing on the charges			2
for those @entity20 who think that @entity3 acted in self - defense to save his own life , the decision to charge him is tantamount to giving in to a mob			1
in fact , as i skipped from one conservative talk radio show to another wednesday afternoon , that 's how i heard it described by hosts and callers alike			2
yet , for those who believe that @entity3 was the aggressor in this fateful encounter , that he racially profiled @entity14 and then essentially hunted him down , the decision represents something else : justice			1
that 's how @entity14 's family described it in applauding @entity3 's arrest			1
personally , i 'm thankful the suspect is in custody			0
and that has nothing to do with which team i 'm on -- @entity46 or @entity47			0
but , if you must know , i do n't have a team			0
i do n't know that really happened on the night of february 26 on that dark street in @entity53 , @entity4			0
after all , we were n't there			0
of course , we all have our biases			0
and some of mine come from being the son of a retired cop who spent 37 years on the job			0
from that vantage point , i would just as soon people like @entity3 leave the police work to the professionals			1
and yet , even so , once the struggle began and the two men are wrestling on the ground , if @entity3 felt his life was threatened , i ca n't condemn his decision to use deadly force to defend himself			2
i 'm only sure of this much : this case had to go to trial			0
it had to be this way			0
whether you think @entity3 is innocent or guilty , we all should be able to agree on that much			2
we could n't go on otherwise , with one segment of the country believing that someone got away with second - degree murder and the suspect looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life			0
this case cries out for clarity and resolution , and the only place to get either is in court			1
we need to be able to see and hear the evidence , and let a jury decide whether @entity3 is guilty as charged or whether he acted in self - defense			2
whatever the verdict turns out to be , let 's hope that both camps are mature enough to accept it			2
too many people have already made up their minds			1
in fact , it 's hard to see how @entity3 can get a fair trial -- especially in @entity104			1
the country has n't been this racially divided since the @entity109 criminal trial in 1995			1
and as with that trial , how you see these events seems to have a lot to do with the color of your skin			0
but this time , there 's a twist			0
during the @entity109 trial , when the defendant was black and the victims were white , polls showed that most whites thought the former football star was guilty , while african - americans urged us to wait for the evidence to come in			2
in the @entity14 case , the roles are reversed as many african - americans seem quick to convict @entity3 and many whites urge us to wait for the evidence to come in			1
that 's not a good sign			0
do @entity20 need better laws , or just better memories ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140			1

@entity140 : it 's a step *forward* to have the @entity14 case go to court
he says @entity20 seems divided into camps over @entity3 's guilt or innocence
the case cries out for clarity and resolution , which can only come in court , he says
@entity140 : too many people have made up their minds , as they did in @entity109 case
