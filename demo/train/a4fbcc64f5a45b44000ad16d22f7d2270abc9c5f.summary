-- practicing the clarinet may be beyond tedious for teenagers forced into music lessons by their parents but for 70 - year - old @entity6 it 's a labor of love			1
saxophonist @entity8 from @entity9 , @entity10 , practices in @entity12 , @entity13 , in march 2006 " from the time i was a little kid , i always wanted to play clarinet , " says @entity6 , a retired scientist in @entity14 , @entity15			1
" but we did n't have the money			0
then ... i decided it was now or never			0
" @entity6 , who plays with a local band , is one of many seniors picking up a musical instrument late in life			1
many can thank @entity25 , which sponsors senior bands and orchestras in the @entity28 and @entity29			1
the group was founded by @entity31 , professor emeritus at the @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34			1
when he formed the first senior - only band in 1991 , it was a radical notion			1
" it was widely believed that the window of opportunity for learning music was childhood , " @entity31 says			1
" if you did n't learn then , you missed your chance			0
" the senior bands prove otherwise			1
as a matter of fact , these novice musicians give new meaning to the conductor 's command , " once more , with feeling			0
" " i remember conducting at a senior band camp in @entity13 , and we played an arioso by @entity55 , " recalls @entity31			1
" the second time through , two people were crying , they were so touched by the music			1
" high school kids could never do what we do , because they have n't lived enough , they have n't seen enough joy or sorrow			0
we have a special ability to play music expressively and with feeling			1
" @entity31 , who sometimes refers to himself as the @entity66 of senior bands , made it his goal to bring seniors to music			1
from just one band in @entity33 , @entity25 has grown to more than a hundred bands , plus offshoots from brass quintets to swing ensembles			1
music for body and soul @entity31 's passion moved professor @entity81 of the @entity82 to create his own senior band -- and to conduct research into how music can benefit older musicians			1
his findings : benefits include social , emotional , physical and even spiritual growth			1
in part , @entity91 found , seniors benefit from being part of a group that works together toward a significant goal			1
other plusses can include better ability to focus , increased lung capacity and improved fine motor skills			0
she 'd played trombone in high school ; after retiring , she attended a performance of @entity91 's @entity107 band and thought , " i can do that ! " playing in the band " has been one of the most rewarding experiences of not only my retirement , but my life , " says stamp , who turns 78 this month			0
" it 's a joy to make wonderful music with new friends and to share this music with the community			1
" @entity120 , 62 , another member of the @entity107 band , took up the oboe about three months before retirement			0
" i find that playing music really keeps your mind agile ... and our band director wants to challenge us to do well , think hard , try hard			1
it 's just so much fun			0
" she 's enjoying herself so much that she has taken up the bassoon as well			0
getting started if you 're interested in getting involved with instrumental music , look for a band in your area on the @entity25 web site			1
if there 's no senior band available , or if you 're interested in learning on your own , most teachers are willing to take on an older student			1
@entity6 advises searching for the right kind of person so you 're not quickly turned off			0
" it 's important , if you 're going to start cold , to really find a good teacher -- someone who sets standards for you but is also mature enough to understand that it 's unusual for an older person to take up something about which they know nothing			2
" there are real differences between younger and older learners			0
" adults are often more analytical about their learning and more persistent , so some display more rapid growth than would a 10 - year - old beginner , " @entity91 explains			2
" on the other hand , the physical demands of some instruments may lead to a plateauing effect for adults			2
" some seniors , for example , may not be able to sustain high notes on a trumpet			2
which instrument should you choose ? if you 've always had a passion for one instrument , @entity31 says , go with your heart			2
but if you 're not sure , ask for suggestions from the band director			0
" if the group does n't have a tuba player , you 'd be quite the hero if you became one , " he says			2
who knows ? you might even become a bit of a hero to yourself			0
" music is so demanding and compelling that once you start playing , everything else flies out the window , " @entity6 says			2
" it gives you a deeper appreciation of music and musicians			2
and sometimes my music sounds really good to me , and that 's wonderful			2
" @entity31 : saxophonist @entity8 from @entity9 , @entity10 , practices with other band members at a @entity25 band camp in @entity12 , @entity13 , in march 2006			0
many of the musicians did not take up an instrument until retirement			2
@entity198 : @entity101 , 78 , played the trombone in high school			0
she took it up again when she joined a senior band in @entity107 , @entity107			0
