-- it worked in @entity3 's @entity2			2
now , taking their cue from social - media fueled uprisings in places like @entity9 and @entity10 , a band of online activists hopes it will work on @entity13			1
@entity14 , co-founder of the counterculture magazine @entity15 , has taken to @entity16 and other websites to help organize a campaign encouraging tens of thousands of @entity19 to hold a nonviolent sit - in saturday in @entity20 , the heart of the @entity19 financial district			1
this past spring and summer saw a massive groundswell of populist demonstrations against authoritarian regimes in @entity26 and the @entity27 -- the @entity28 of 2011			2
in @entity30 , @entity9 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 , protesters took to the streets and occupied public spaces to protest stagnant economies , lack of freedom of expression and regimes that seemed more concerned with consolidating power than addressing the needs of the people			1
each of these revolutions began differently , but they all were organized and fueled by tech - savvy social media users , particularly on @entity46 and @entity16			1
@entity14 now wants to use the internet for a protest in the @entity19			1
" there 's a very visceral anger against the financial community , " @entity14 said			2
" many people feel that these people who are financial fraudsters , who basically got away with it , have yet to be brought to justice ... it seems like we the people now have to congregate on @entity13 and other financial districts around the world and force the global economic system to move in a better , more just direction			2
" @entity15 ' protest campaign -- with the hashtag # occupywallstreet -- began in july with the launch of a simple campaign website calling for a march through the streets of @entity20 and a sit - in at the @entity71 , just as demonstrators did in @entity74 ' november 7 square and @entity3 's @entity2			1
the campaign got a sizable boost in august from the hacktivist group @entity77 , which released a short video urging its supporters to participate in the sit - in			1
since then , the movement has seen the addition of planned protests in other countries , including @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 and a half - dozen @entity88 nations			2
the aim of # occupywallstreet is to draw 20,000 protestors to @entity93 's financial district , although @entity14 hopes for as many as 90,000			0
" in @entity30 and in @entity9 , the @entity47 was used to organize surprising numbers of people to get out into the streets and start a radical , democratic movement for regime change , " @entity14 said			1
" of course , the situation here in @entity19 and many @entity88 countries is quite different			0
we 're not living under a torturous dictatorship , for one			0
" nonetheless , there 's a feeling that the global financial system , the heart of which is in the @entity19 , in @entity93 , that this system is somehow having its way with us , " he said			0
" there 's a feeling that we need a revolution in the way that our economy is run , the way that @entity118 is run			0
" this is n't , @entity14 stresses , an excuse for rioting and looting like the world recently witnessed in the @entity124			0
it 's a call for radical change , but in the tradition of nonviolent protesters like @entity127 , he says			0
if protests turn violent , he fears the message will be lost			0
" what we are hoping for is to have a very large number of people turn up in @entity20 and start walking toward @entity13 peacefully , signs in hand , " @entity14 said			0
" if we have peaceful assemblies and debates about what our demands to president @entity143 should be , then bit by bit we can create a situation that will rival what happened in @entity9			1
" " that would be a wonderful , energizing and positive moment to feel like we the people are in charge , " he said .			0
