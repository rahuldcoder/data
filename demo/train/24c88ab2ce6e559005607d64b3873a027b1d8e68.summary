-- as a society , we do too much short - term thinking			1
in @entity5 , that has meant passing bills that paper over fiscal problems in the short term while ignoring long - term consequences for future generations			1
the result is a fiscal gap that places unknown financial burdens on today 's young people			0
we may have different prescriptions for how to address our budget challenges , but from a personal standpoint , we both worry about how a lack of information about long - term budget realities will affect our children 's generations and those that follow			1
we want @entity24 to do more long - term planning , like families and businesses across this country do every day			1
instead of kicking the can down the road , @entity24 and the administration need to understand how policy decisions made today in @entity5 will affect future generations of @entity34			2
on wednesday , we are introducing a bill to bring more transparency to the budget process and ensure that members of @entity24 and the administration are honest with themselves and the @entity41 people about current and future budget realities			1
right now , @entity24 only looks at the effect of legislation over the next 10 years			0
rarely is information presented that reflects the longer - term impact			2
our bill -- the @entity48 , or @entity49 -- would ensure that @entity24 , the administration and the @entity41 people have the information necessary to understand the effect that taxes , spending policies and future economic advancements will have on the fiscal health of the country and on individual @entity34 20 , 50 or even 75 years down the road			1
the @entity59 would require the president to provide a detailed accounting of how the administration 's budget and policy recommendations , and its predictions of economic health , would affect young people down the line			2
it would also require the @entity69 to provide an annual analysis of the impact of future budget realities on generations to come and account for any fiscal gaps ( the difference between spending and tax revenue )			1
this approach -- known as a generational accounting and fiscal gap analysis -- would examine the full scope of the government 's obligations , present and future , and then look at the effect those obligations will have on current and future generations			2
presidents @entity88 and @entity90 each used this tool in submitting executive budgets			0
@entity34 in their 20s and 30s deserve to know what the decisions of today 's lawmakers mean for their future			0
and lawmakers should use every tool at our disposal to make better decisions			0
we believe this approach will help us improve the fiscal health of the country			0
@entity5 has spent enough time kicking the can down the road			0
it 's time to start being honest about the long - term challenges facing future generations			1

@entity117 , @entity118 : @entity120 's fiscal thinking does *n't* account for long term
they say @entity24 , administration must analyze budget moves for future effect
they say their new bill -- @entity49 -- would require this and account for fiscal gaps
writers : lawmakers must be honest about long - term challenges for future
