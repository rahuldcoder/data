-- like a @entity6 child 's fantasy , @entity3 's fairy - godmother - like teenage angel stretched out her arms and said , " if you 're very , very gentle , you can touch my wings			1
" i stayed seated while little @entity12 preschoolers mobbed the stage to touch their christkind			1
in southern @entity6 , a lovely angel named the @entity14 charms wonderstruck children			1
@entity12 and @entity18 -- two traditional regions of @entity6 and @entity20 -- are great for @entity22 traditions			1
while most travelers visit for the @entity22 markets , that 's just the start of the holiday charm			1
@entity6 's grandest @entity22 market , in @entity3 , comes complete with an angelic @entity14 dressed in gold , played by a real - life teenage girl			1
how does a female @entity14 fit in the @entity22 story ? five hundred years ago , @entity34 -- the church reformer who hailed from these parts -- wanted to shift the focus from @entity37 back to the @entity39 child			1
but as @entity6 had a hard time getting their mind around baby jesus giving gifts , the @entity22 gift - giver gradually morphed into a sweet girl who was still called the @entity39 child ( or @entity14 )			1
i was in @entity3 producing a tv program about traditional @entity50 @entity22 celebrations			1
i had arranged an interview with the @entity14			2
chosen every other year in a contest , she 's like a rock star ... complete with bodyguard , publicist and entourage			1
we had been filming a montage of mistletoe kisses in action			2
after the interview , i pulled out the mistletoe and asked if i could give her a little kiss			2
her bodyguard explained she could kiss my cheek ... but i could n't kiss hers			2
each culture has a mythic gift - giver that parents use to encourage kids to be nice , not naughty			2
in @entity73 children enjoy an annual visit from a dynamic @entity22 duo : @entity76 -- @entity73 - @entity6 for " @entity37 " -- and the black - clad henchman @entity77 , his sidekick			2
we filmed @entity73 children promising they were nice and not naughty , singing @entity76 a carol , and eagerly digging into his big burlap bag to get their goodies			2
while much of @entity50 is down on the commercialism of the holiday season ( i even found some towns that had proclaimed " @entity88 - free " zones ) , much of @entity50 is also so secular that you hardly see any @entity22 festivities			1
@entity20 , however , celebrates with sacred and traditional gusto			2
visiting a @entity93 farming family , i enjoyed dashing through the fields in a two - horse open sleigh			0
then , at the door of their gingerbread - cute yet massive home , the entire clan greeted us with a @entity22 yodel			0
inside their time - warp home , grandma made cookies , an old @entity108 grandpa played the zither , and @entity110 lit the advent wreath while teaching her child the significance of each candle			0
@entity115 blessed the house from the attic to the barn by spreading incense smoke and sprinkling holy water			0
the parents decorated the tree in secret , placed the gifts , and lit the real candles			0
they rang a bell , and the kids tumbled into the room filled with joy			0
my time in @entity20 had its musical ups and downs			0
in @entity133 , my film crew and i hiked to the abbey where @entity135 of " @entity136 " caused her fellow sisters to sing , " how do you solve a problem like @entity135 ? " the sisters had agreed to let us be present at their holy mass. our soundman carefully set up the microphone stand to the side of the altar , facing the choir of nuns ( as i sat in the back happily humming " @entity150 " )			0
suddenly , the old but very spry @entity151 dashed across the altar , evicting the soundman , who had to drag all his gear out of that holy zone			0
we heard the music , but could n't record it			0
thankfully , the next morning -- christmas morning -- we were given a royal perch in the @entity133 cathedral			0
as the cameras rolled , a huge orchestra and choir filled the place with a glorious , powerful @entity164 @entity20 is the home of " @entity165			0
" in @entity167 -- the town just outside of @entity133 where the song originated -- i hoped to catch a performance of " @entity165 " for viewers			0
on christmas eve , we scrambled to record at several spots where events were to take place			0
but it was basically a muddy , touristy mess , with underwhelming music and not a hint of the magic we had naively hoped for			0
i managed to persuade a couple of musicians to perform a private little concert in the town 's church for us			1
after a day of frustration , we filmed " @entity165 " as it was first played -- with two guitars and two singers			0
today , this heavenly song can be heard from small - town street corners in @entity192 to magnificent cathedrals in @entity50			1
however and wherever you celebrate this year , i hope you too have a peaceful holiday -- as the song says -- both calm and bright			1
