satellite images of @entity3 's @entity2 nuclear facility have again raised questions about whether the country has restarted its plutonium production reactor -- regarded by western experts as a key component in the development of a nuclear weapon			1
researchers from @entity13 - based groups examined satellite images from august 31			0
they showed two columns of steam rising from a building , believed to house the reactor 's steam turbines and electric generators			1
the steam indicates that the reactor is in or nearing operation , wrote @entity24 and @entity25 , in a 38 @entity3 blog post , a program of the @entity13 - @entity28 at @entity29			1
work to reopen the reactor progressed throughout this spring and summer , they wrote			0
" this is something they ( @entity3 ) very much need to arm their arsenal , and that is really linked into what they see as marketing power on the international plane , " @entity32 , founder of @entity33 , told @entity34			2
" without this type of nuclear capability , or at least the perception of the threat of having nuclear capabilities , @entity3 really has few bargaining chips			1
" but @entity49 has gone down this path before			0
first completed in the 1980s , @entity3 agreed to shut the @entity2 facility in 1994 after backing down from a threat to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty			1
it restarted the reactor in 2002 , before it was once again disabled in 2007 after a six - party agreement between @entity58 , the @entity13 , @entity3 and @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			2
in april this year , @entity3 stated that it would be " readjusting and restarting all the nuclear facilities " in @entity2 , which includes the uranium enrichment plant and the reactor , the country 's state - run news agency @entity62 said			1
" this work will be put into practice without delay , " the @entity3 report stated at the time			0
analysts say it appears @entity3 has fulfilled its word			0
@entity74 and @entity75 , from the @entity76 , examined the latest satellite images and agreed the venting appeared most likely connected to the operation of the reactor			0
they also wrote last month that @entity3 appeared to have greatly expanded a building used in the uranium enrichment process			0
the expansions and developments " provide @entity3 with the ability to expand its stocks of plutonium , as well as produce more highly enriched uranium for nuclear weapons , " wrote @entity84 and @entity75			2
they estimated that @entity3 would likely need two to three years to produce plutonium , which is essential in creating nuclear weapons			2
" there remains time to negotiate a shutdown of the reactor before @entity3 can use any of this new plutonium in nuclear weapons " they added			1
" if a shutdown is achieved in the next six months , the reactor would have produced very little plutonium			0

researchers point to steam at @entity3 facility
they write that it 's a sign that the reactor is near or in operation
@entity3 has opened , shut , *re-opened* , reshut this reactor before
@entity3 said in april it would restart nuclear facility in april
