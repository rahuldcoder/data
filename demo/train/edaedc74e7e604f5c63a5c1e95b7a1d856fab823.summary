@entity0 @entity0 's unpopular chief executive @entity2 , nicknamed " the wolf " by detractors , has one @entity6 's request for his city 's people : be more like sheep			1
" last year was no easy ride for @entity0 , " said the @entity11 leader in an official statement released wednesday			1
" in the coming year , i hope that all people in @entity0 will take inspiration from the sheep 's character and pull together in an accommodating manner to work for @entity0 's future			1
" sheep are widely seen to be mild and gentle animals living peacefully in groups , " explained @entity2			0
at first glance , the statement might seem innocent enough -- perhaps even cute			0
but it 's a sharp rebuke to thousands of @entity26 who staged a massive protest just three months ago in an unsuccessful call for @entity2 's resignation			1
popularly known as the " @entity31 , " demonstrators occupied major roads for over two months and demanded genuine universal suffrage : the right to nominate and elect their next leader			0
@entity2 -- who was elected by a small committee dominated by @entity39 loyalists -- staunchly resisted the protests			0
@entity41 , a legislator who participated in the demonstrations , was horrified by @entity2 's @entity44 wish			1
" does he know he has been called a wolf by @entity0 people ? " he said			0
" so is it the wolf speaking , wanting @entity0 people to behave like sheep , so as to be slaughtered and eaten up by him ? " i think it 's crazy , and he is sick			2
" the leader 's lupine nickname is well - known in the city			2
in late 2013 , a protester hurled an @entity57 stuffed wolf at @entity2 , causing the toy to sell out in stores across the city			2
although @entity0 's pro-democracy street occupations have been dispersed , fierce discontent remains among residents who feel the former @entity66 colony 's values are collapsing under the weight of mainland @entity69 's influence			1
protesters have repeatedly vowed to organize new forms of civil disobedience this year			0
when the largest street camps were cleared in december , many demonstrators left banners with a simple message : " we 'll be back			0

@entity0 's @entity11 leader @entity2 asks city 's residents to be like ' sheep '
@entity2 's nickname among detractors is ' wolf '
