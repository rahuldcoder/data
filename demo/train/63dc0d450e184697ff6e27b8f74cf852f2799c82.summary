the sickening smell of burnt flesh still lingers in the air at the women 's university			1
all that remains of the bus students had boarded to travel home is a dark , twisted structure			1
the bomb ripped off the roof , the ensuing fire so fierce it melted everything in its path			1
these buses were provided by the vice chancellor to encourage families to send their daughters to the university -- a safe means to get to and from home for young girls in a troubled province			1
but the attackers showed no mercy			2
books that were the path to a brighter future reduced to ashes strewn across the floor			2
pencils and satchels -- the accoutrements of education -- destroyed like so many lives that were lost			1
militants , including a female suicide bomber , attacked the university bus on saturday and then struck a hospital where the survivors were taken for treatment			1
the dead included students on the bus , four nurses , four @entity47 paramilitary troops and four militants , police said			1
i came across a page in which one young woman had written an essay on @entity53 , known as the " weeping philospher			2
" her words on the burnt page so poignant after the tragedy			2
she wrote about " the reality of change , the impermanence of being , the inconsistency of everything but change itself			0
" twelve young women are confirmed to have been killed in this ruthless bus bombing , all of them students at the university			1
some of them were the first women in their family 's history to be sent to school and university			1
@entity74 is one of them			0
despite her severe injuries , doctors think she was in a second bus following behind the one that was attacked			1
in the hospital ward where some of the most seriously injured girls are being treated , she told me how she and her family were so proud she made it to university			1
many of the friends she traveled with have been killed			0
she describes them as " good girls who studied hard			0
" beside her , one young woman stares blindly into space , too shocked to talk			1
@entity74 described the horror of the bombing			0
" i was sitting by window when the bomb went off			1
i had no idea what happened			0
then i realized i 'd injured my legs			0
i cried for help , hoping someone would save me			0
" her leg is broken , she has burns all over her body , shrapnel has cut her face			1
but like any young woman would , she whispers that she is worried if her hair will ever grow back			0
she lifts up the surgical cap and shows me			0
as she holds my hand she boldly says : " the people who did this are very cruel			0
" and asks : " we are just students - what did we do to them , to deserve this ? " walking across the hospital ground a lone woman approaches me			1
tears in her eyes , @entity120 tells me her 20 - year - old daughter is in intensive care			0
part of her skull is missing , but she thanks @entity128 surgeons managed to save her life			0
@entity120 explains how much sending her daughter to university means to the family			1
" we are really poor people			0
my husband has worked hard to send our daughter to school and university			1
so she could have a better future than us			0
she was supposed to have an exam today			0
she asks us to pray for her daughter			0
investigators are now going through the wreckage piece by piece to identify the exact nature of this blast			0
a senior intelligence official , who did n't want to be named , told @entity148 it was a female suicide bomber that targeted fellow young women at the @entity152			2
the bombing was just the beginning			0
a group of militants was waiting at the hospital down the road			2
the @entity159 is the largest government - run hospital in @entity161			2
militants attacked the hospital as the young women injured in the bus bombing were rushed there			1
hundreds of people were held hostage -- patients , doctors , nurses and survivors -- until police and paramilitary forces took control after a five - hour shootout			0
now the hospital is sealed off and shut down -- guarded by paramilitary forces			2
@entity179 , @entity161 and the rest of @entity181 is still struggling to understand the attacks , shattering innocent young lives and those of their friends and family			1
across the city there is a sense of shock , pain , confusion and helplessness			0
in a restaurant a man tentatively asks me " who did this ? " he seems scared to even ask			0
in a culture where women have long been oppressed , the university was a shining light -- a symbol of hope and women 's rights -- where 3,000 women studied			1
families have made groundbreaking decisions to be the first to send their daughters to study for a degree with the hope of a career and brighter future			2
vicious attacks like the bus bombing are doing their best to set those groundbreaking decisions back -- to ensure regret , to scare people and in particular young women back into their homes			1
@entity74 had been studying to be a teacher and says she wo n't give up			2
she looks me straight in the eye and says with confidence : " we wo n't stop learning because of the people who attacked us			0
as soon as i get better , i 'll go back to university with even more drive and hope			2
" and for the first time in this hospital ward , i see a young woman smile .			1
