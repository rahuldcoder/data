-- as an @entity3 executive , i 'm always looking for untapped potential			2
as a proud native of @entity6 , i believe that @entity7 is one of the world 's greatest resources in that area			1
from @entity13 and @entity14 to @entity15 and @entity16 , there is so much size and athletic ability across the continent			2
some tribes in @entity16 and @entity15 have an average height of 6 - foot - 6 , which also happens to be the size of the average @entity3 player			0
people in @entity6 , @entity26 and @entity27 tend to be very big and physical			2
we need to build a strategy to go into these regions and cultivate the talent through infrastructure and instruction			2
not long ago , soccer in @entity7 was almost the same way			1
kids in @entity7 start kicking a ball when they are six or seven years old , if not younger			1
it 's like baseball , basketball and football in @entity43			2
if you 're talented , people will find you			0
that 's what happened with soccer			2
the number of academies has grown rapidly , and people are really into it			0
as a result , nearly every major soccer team has a lot of @entity7 players			1
through my experience as a @entity60 player , coach and now @entity3 executive , i believe basketball can follow a similar path			0
it starts with building facilities			0
we need to start investing in outdoor courts and indoor gyms for kids to play			1
from @entity71 : @entity60 @entity3 boss finding basketball stars most kids in @entity7 do n't start playing basketball until they are 13 or 14 years old			1
this puts them at a disadvantage because they lack the instincts and must work harder to develop the skills and habits formed at an early age			0
with a tremendous assist from the @entity3 , @entity83 and the @entity84 ( @entity84 ) , we have been trying to provide opportunities for the next generation of @entity7 basketball players			1
every year , we conduct the @entity89 camp , sponsored by @entity90 and @entity83 , as well as the @entity92 elite camp			1
nearly 100 campers have gone on to play college basketball in the @entity43 , including @entity95 , who now plays for the @entity96			0
@entity97 ( @entity98 ) is one of several @entity7 success stories			1
@entity101 ( @entity27 ) is a rising star for the @entity102 , and @entity103 ( born in @entity16 ) was an all - star last year for the @entity105			0
these guys are great examples for young people in @entity7			1
kids are beginning to see the possibilities because of the exposure of the @entity3			0
it was unfortunate that @entity113 ( @entity6 ) , @entity114 ( @entity27 ) and @entity115 ( @entity16 ) -- three @entity7 giants -- came in an era before the internet , cable and satellite television			1
a lot of @entity7 kids have heard of these guys , but they do n't know the scope of their accomplishments			1
@entity103 , @entity101 and @entity126 are trying to become giants themselves , but they ca n't do it alone			0
read related : @entity6 gears up for motorsports debut through the sprite clinics and @entity134 , we 've been to @entity27 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity6 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity15 , @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142			0
on a continent with more than a billion people , we still have a lot more ground to cover , and we need help from sponsors in @entity7			1
we need more companies to help build courts and gymnasiums for kids to play			0
@entity153 paid for a world - class floor made in the @entity43			0
that 's what we use for my @entity89 of @entity7 camp			1
for years , @entity83 has generously provided shoes and equipment for the players			0
that is the kind of support we need from influential investors in @entity7			1
as you can probably tell , the push to develop talent in @entity7 is personal			1
i know how much talent there is			0
we have to concentrate on building facilities , establishing successful leagues and finding investors to help young players			0
@entity43 gave me the opportunity , but i truly believe @entity7 is going to be the next big thing			1
it is going to be prominent in tapping basketball talent			2
i really hope i 'm alive to see it happen			0
this much is certain : i will die trying			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity7 " the next big thing " in basketball , says @entity189 gm @entity184
soccer talent on the continent was also untapped until academies were built
@entity195 need more outdoor courts and indoor gyms , *argues* @entity184
basketball without @entity200 and @entity89 camp are helping but need support
