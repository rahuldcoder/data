@entity0 -- workers at @entity5 's crippled @entity4 nuclear plant faced a difficult balancing act tuesday as they struggled to keep reactors cool and prevent radioactive water from leaking into the ocean			1
water has been a key weapon in the battle to stave off a meltdown at the facility since a march 11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out cooling systems			0
but tons of water have been pumped and sprayed to keep the plant 's radioactive fuel from overheating , and the plant is running out of room to store the now - contaminated liquid			2
" now the focus is how to ... remove the water and contain it safely , " chief cabinet secretary @entity26 , the government 's point man for the crisis , told reporters tuesday			0
the discovery of contaminated water in a maintenance tunnel that leads to the no. 2 reactor 's turbine plant has sparked fresh concerns about the possibility of additional radiation leaking from the plant			1
@entity5 's nuclear safety agency said workers were using sandbags and concrete panels to keep the water inside the tunnel , which is located about 55 meters ( 180 feet ) from the @entity48 shore			1
workers are also trying to pump water out of the turbine houses of the no. 1 and no. 3 reactors , according to the @entity54 , the plant 's owner			1
lights were restored in the main control room of the no. 4 reactor , the utility said			1
the company also reported that freshwater was being injected into the no. 3 reactor			1
" @entity54 is in an awful dilemma right now , " said @entity65 , an international security expert at the @entity66			1
" one the one hand , they want to cool the reactor and keep the reactor cool , so they have to pour water in			2
if there is a leak in one of the containment vessels , that water keeps leaking out			0
so they have a problem where the more they try to cool it down , the greater the radiation hazard as that water leaks out from the plant			2
" @entity5 officials and international experts have said they believe there 's been a partial meltdown at three of the plant 's six reactors , and @entity26 reported monday that the no. 2 reactor 's containment vessel may be leaking			1
" the high radiation levels on site seem to support that idea			1
there is no visual proof yet , but it 's increasingly likely there was partial fuel melting , " said @entity96 was , a nuclear engineering expert at the @entity98			0
the discovery of plutonium , a nuclear fission byproduct as well as a component of the fuel in the no. 3 reactor , among the contaminants on the plant grounds bolsters the suspicion of a meltdown , @entity103 said			1
though low levels of plutonium can be found worldwide -- a legacy of previous decades of aboveground nuclear tests -- at least some of the contamination likely came from the plant , @entity26 said tuesday			2
" if we detect higher levels of plutonium , we have to take additional measures , so our intention for now is to carry on with the monitoring on - site , " he said			2
the element can be a serious health hazard if inhaled or ingested , but external exposure poses little health risk , according to the @entity129 @entity128			1
experts told a @entity132 hearing tuesday they are not sure how soon the reactors and spent fuel can be safely inspected			0
@entity5 officials have been given information on radiation - hardened robots that are being made available to make such observations , said @entity139 , acting assistant secretary for nuclear energy in the @entity142			1
the now 19 - day - old crisis at the plant has spread radioactive contamination across much of northern @entity5			1
but @entity54 said the discovery of plutonium would not change efforts to bring an end to the disaster , an aftereffect of the magnitude - 9 earthquake that struck the region march 11			1
the water found in the @entity157 maintenance tunnel remained radioactive enough to pose an immediate hazard , authorities reported monday afternoon			0
the 1,000 - millisievert per hour reading was more than 330 times the dose an average person in a developed country receives per year and can result in vomiting and up to a 30 % higher risk of cancer , according to the @entity166			0
the level is also four times the top dose @entity5 's @entity169 has set for emergency workers			1
radioactive iodine and cesium , also reactor byproducts , have turned up in the sea near the plant			2
but the levels reported by the utility on tuesday were down sharply from those seen over the weekend			2
tuesday 's tests found levels of iodine - 131 , an isotope that loses half its radioactivity within eight days , at 816 times normal levels within about 100 feet of the plant			0
that 's down from a high of 1,850 times normal reported sunday at another nearby monitoring post			0
authorities have said they do n't think the seawater contamination is coming directly from the plant , but could be caused by particles carried by runoff or that have fallen from the atmosphere			0
meanwhile , @entity26 told reporters tuesday that officials hope to find workers to relieve those at the plant , who have been scrambling for nearly three weeks to keep the reactors under control			0
" on the ground at the nuclear power plant , the workers are working under very dangerous and very hard conditions , and i feel a great deal of respect for them , " he said			0
as workers inside brave high radiation , the situation has also taken a significant toll beyond the complex 's six reactors			0
authorities have banned sale and transport of some vegetables grown in the area after tests detected radiation			0
signs of contaminated tap water prompted officials to tell residents in some areas to stop giving it to infants			0
and the government has said residents within a 20 - kilometer ( 12 - mile ) radius of the plant must evacuate			0
the growing damages could have a steep price tag for the embattled @entity54 , as farmers and others impacted by the disaster ask for compensation			1
some have questioned whether @entity5 's government will step in , and one government minister told reporters tuesday that nationalizing the company could be an option			1
" of course , a debate on various options should be possible , " @entity5 national strategy minister @entity245 told reporters when asked whether the government was considering at least partially nationalizing the company			1
another topic @entity5 officials are already beginning to debate is the country 's energy policy -- and particularly its reliance on nuclear power			1
@entity26 said the government will continue to " strongly promote " clean energy , but fixing problems at the troubled @entity4 nuclear plant and reviewing the safety of the nation 's other plants take precedence			0
@entity264 , a nuclear engineering professor at @entity0 's @entity265 , told @entity1 that he remained optimistic that the threat at @entity4 would be contained soon			0
he said @entity5 's lack of other resources such as oil or coal made nuclear power a necessity			2
" already , dependence on oil in @entity5 is very high , " he said			2
@entity5 imports nearly 80 % of its oil , a fact @entity264 called " very bad for national security			2
" " from these considerations , maybe some countrypeople will understand the other option of power generation , nuclear power , can play a role , " he said			0
@entity1 's @entity284 , @entity285 and @entity286 contributed to this report			0
