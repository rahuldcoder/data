-- every four years , hundreds of reporters , photojournalists , producers and other journalists take to the campaign trail to document every move of the men and women who want to become president			1
starting in 2011 and continuing into 2012 , we unleashed our team of embeds -- reporters and producers who are " embedded " with presidential candidates for months at a time and send back the breaking and mundane news from the campaign trail			1
our team of embeds -- including @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 -- report for both @entity27 and @entity0 digital throughout the 2012 campaign			1
on tuesday june 5 at noon et on cnn.com / roundtable , they will join host @entity32 -- a veteran of several campaigns himself -- for an exclusive live video chat about life on the campaign			1
here are a few of their stories -- in their own words -- from covering the presidential election of 2012 : --- --- --- --- --- - @entity25 there are very few jobs where your office is a bus , a plane , a press riser in the back of a campaign event , and your competitors are also colleagues			1
campaigns are grueling for candidates , their staff and the journalists who cover them but for all of the advances in technology , nothing replaces seeing a candidate up close day after day interacting with people			1
one moment came during a town hall where reporters asked @entity66 to explain himself on the rope line after the event : during a town hall in @entity70 earlier , @entity66 took a question from a woman who , during the course of her remarks , accused president @entity75 of treason			1
@entity66 ultimately ignored that comment			1
on the rope line after the event , i asked him why he did n't acknowledge that part of her question			1
he said he does n't " correct all the answers that get asked of me " and added , " obviously i do n't agree that he should be tried			1
" the @entity75 campaign promptly responded to the story i filed about the exchange , which i captured on my @entity88 , by criticizing @entity66 for not standing up to " hateful and over-the - line rhetoric			1
" --- --- --- --- --- - @entity24 something you might 've heard : journalists are a bunch of backstabbing , hyper - competitive , coffee - swilling egotists			1
i can report that the coffee thing is not true			1
many of us prefer @entity98			2
life on the campaign trail also fleshes out another truth : though political reporters do compete to break and cover news , we often stick together -- like a " team of rivals " -- when one or all of us feel set upon			1
consider what happened at a february event in @entity108 , @entity109 : reporters , including myself , were covering @entity111			2
after his speech , we tried to do what we typically do : film and report on the candidate 's interaction with supporters			2
as we approached , security men roped off a few of us from getting near the candidate			2
but , i noticed one cable news producer filming directly in front of @entity111 and some photojournalists snapping away			2
" you ca n't let some of us near @entity111 but tell the rest of us to stay back ! " i snapped at security			2
" it 's either no press -- or all press ! " my colleagues joined the protest			2
ultimately , we only succeeded in raising a stink			2
but we did succeed in sticking together as one media contingent			2
there was the time last november in @entity139 , @entity140 , as sexual harassment allegations dogged @entity142 , that his bodyguard tried to keep a @entity145 reporter at a distance and from asking a question			2
the bodyguard asked me if i knew the reporter			2
not only did i vouch for him , i told the bodyguard i would not play his game of pick - and - choose the reporter			0
then there was the time @entity154 apparently hoped to avoid questions about the @entity158 @entity157 's delay of the execution of a @entity161 death - row inmate			0
after his tour of a bottling plant in @entity164 , @entity140 , i popped a question on the court 's delay			0
annoyed , @entity154 briefly and blandly answered , then moved on			0
my colleague at @entity169 would not have it			0
he followed up with another question on the subject -- a one - two punch that gave all of us a fuller answer to report			0
the campaign trail is littered with stories like these : reporters sticking together , working together to file deadlines , even helping each other with broken or missing equipment			1
i even once put money in a parking meter for a colleague when i noticed his meter time was up			0
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- - @entity188 one part of the job is making sure we get enough " generic " video of the candidate -- it 's called b - roll -- that can be used on tv again and again			0
i picked up a trick occasionally used by still photographers covering the end of an event , as the candidate is shaking hands with supporters : if you see a cute baby , wait nearby for your moment			0
this tactic pays off particularly well when covering former @entity208 gov. @entity66 , who usually ca n't resist lifting babies up high in the air			0
some of us call " the @entity213 lift			0
" and sure enough , at an event in @entity215 , @entity66 obliged			0
holding a smiling youngster who gripped a @entity66 sign in her two small fists , he lifted her high up in the air			0
and @entity0 got the shot			1
another fun moment was when , after hearing @entity66 talk for months about his friendship with an inspiring @entity225 athlete , we finally met the man -- gold - medalist and speed skater @entity226			0
a small , compact speed demon who switched from rollerblading to speed skating , @entity226 told the traveling press corps stories about his and @entity66 's friendship			1
and then he let us try on his olympic gold medal ! --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- - @entity22 in the waning days of the @entity140 caucus campaign , i was trailing @entity161 gov. @entity154 around the state as he scraped for a top three finish in hopes of boosting his faltering campaign			1
a longtime runner who was hobbled by back surgery the previous summer , @entity154 would often wake early in those frigid december mornings and hit the treadmill in whatever hotel chain the campaign and its traveling press corps were in			1
i 'd sometimes encounter @entity154 during my own workouts ; you 'd know he was in the fitness center if a pair of @entity252 was standing guard outside			0
i watched him every now and then on the treadmill			0
he liked to watch @entity254			0
he wore @entity256 running shoes			0
i noticed , enviously , that he usually kept a faster pace and ran for longer times than i did			0
but i also saw that he had more energy on the campaign trail in the final days of the @entity140 sprint than he did when he first embarked on his presidential bid in august			1
his staff knew it , too			0
he was a better debater			0
it was because he was jogging pretty much every day , something he was prevented from doing in previous months because he was lethargic and on painkillers			0
i later spun this morning workout routine of ours into a story about @entity154 's late burst of energy , and how his campaign might have worked out a little differently had be been in top physical condition during those damaging fall debates			1
@entity154 , it turned out , enjoyed the story and our shared interest in running			0
and after his campaign ended , whenever i saw him at political events around the country he would invite me to go jogging with him @entity284 .			1

every 4 years , journalists join presidential campaign trail
@entity0 sent a group starting in 2011
four of them share stories here of the campaign trail
