-- they say the longest journey starts with a single step			0
but with " @entity4 : an @entity7 , " the first in a trilogy adapted from @entity11 's first novel , @entity5 has taken a different approach : he 's gone two steps forward and three steps back			1
in the process he 's undoubtedly made himself a whole lot richer			1
" @entity4 " is dominating screen space across the globe this weekend , and will certainly be among the biggest moneymakers of the year			1
but he 's also jeopardized the legacy of his own " @entity20			2
" fans wo n't want to hear it , but " @entity27 " is a major comedown , a muddle - headed and cumbersome piece of filmmaking that betrays @entity5 's mercenary motives -- @entity11 's book , too			1
" @entity4 " is far lighter work than what followed , and at approximately 350 pages , hardly crying out for the 10 - hour magnum opus treatment ( but three films are so much more profitable than one ! ) for fans , ' @entity4 ' is a family reunion in just shy of three hours , " @entity27 " takes the story up to chapter seven -- about 140 pages in my paperback edition			1
@entity5 has shown his elephantine tendencies before , in the bloated and indulgent extended editions of the " @entity45 " films			0
but in the earlier trilogy -- which i admired and enjoyed , incidentally -- he clearly showed he had the measure of the material and understood both @entity11 's moral convictions and the books ' darker forebodings of impending death and destruction			1
even if it 's something of a dry run for @entity58 's odyssey , " @entity4 " is a different beast			1
there 's so much less at stake in the story of @entity63 ( @entity64 ) joining @entity65 ( @entity66 ) and a band of dwarves in a raid on a dragon 's mountainous lair			1
this is an adventure story , a caper with elves and goblins			2
and yet @entity5 gives it the same portentous , heroic swagger ; the same doomy menaces			0
it 's just that this time the action is spooned out in thimbles			2
the rest of the running time is given over to dwarfish humor , endless , unfunny comic bluster and banter interspersed with duff warrior dirges and desperate close - ups of @entity64 mugging			0
" sluggish " does n't begin to do justice to the way @entity5 has padded out his narrative			0
but there 's worse , far worse , for anyone tempted to check out the movie in its @entity97 , 48 frames per second incarnation ( showcased in approximately 450 premium screens across @entity100 )			2
the theory behind this cutting edge technology -- which doubles the 24 fps that has been standard in movies since the silent era -- is that the faster frame rate allows more luminescence , counterbalancing the loss incurred in 3 - @entity109 it 's clearer , brighter and more immersive -- in theory			1
in practice , it 's clearer , brighter , and utterly alienating			2
i have n't seen the movie screened at 24 fps , but at 48 , the grain of film has been replaced by the gloss of high definition video , which gives everything and everyone a fake , plastic sheen			2
" @entity27 " may look sharp in tv showrooms or on your @entity125 , but in the movie theater the picture 's clarity comes at the loss of texture , shading and consistency			0
shifts from exteriors to dark interiors are especially jarring			0
look also at the dull , flat orange taint that is meant to approximate candle light in numerous scenes , and compare that with the glow you find in " @entity143 , " or " @entity144 , " or your own birthday snaps			0
did @entity5 embrace 48 fps to keep himself interested , because he knew he was retreading old ground ? is he really blind to the limitations of this technology at this stage of its evolution ? i wo n't say it has no future , but for now this emperor has no clothes			0
it 's a colossal misjudgment			0
he 's put his name to the ugliest film of the year , a $ 270 million three - hour epic that looks like a tv show ( " @entity166 " was the first to pop into my head , and " @entity168 " was the most flattering comparison i could come up with			1
) in fairness , there are redeeming features : the movie does sputter into life in the last 45 minutes , especially during a lengthy battle of wits between @entity63 and @entity176			0
and @entity66 miraculously , alone among the cast , transcends the picture 's artificial surface and imposes himself on such drama as he can find			0
in my book that 's not enough return for three hours at the movies , or whatever inflated price they 're charging for your ticket now .			1

" @entity4 : an @entity7 " is the first in a trilogy adapted from @entity11 's first novel
the film is just shy of three hours and takes the story up to chapter seven
*critic* says new technology *displayed* in the film does not serve it well
