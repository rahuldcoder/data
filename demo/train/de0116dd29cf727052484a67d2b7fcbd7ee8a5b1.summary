-- languishing in the tennis equivalent of purgatory , the road to redemption for @entity3 is likely to be a long one			1
the @entity8 returns to the professional tour after his contentious one - year doping suspension ended monday , but at a time when he should be in his prime @entity3 is ranked 842nd -- or in tennis ' abyss			1
that means , without wildcards , he 'll struggle to get into @entity19 and even second - tier events			0
it 's a world away from when @entity3 was ranked 12th or when he became only the seventh man in the @entity23 to win the decisive fifth match in a @entity26 final			1
" honestly , it 's been a tough year , " @entity3 told @entity0 in a telephone interview			1
" mentally it was tough to handle everything but as time went on , i started preparing and practicing , and i was focused on my comeback and new start -- and looking forward to it			0
" from a financial standpoint , many might not have much sympathy for the 28 - year - old			1
after all , he claimed $ 900,000 in prize money in 2011 and has pocketed $ 4.5 million in his career			0
even taking into account expenses , he 's probably made a nice profit , and @entity3 acknowledged that during his time away from the game , he 's been able to live a " normal " life			1
he felt wronged by his ban and in that respect , he has backers including good pal and world no. 1 @entity50			2
@entity3 's tale was a case of he said , she said			1
feeling ill and saying he had a longstanding fear of needles , @entity3 refused to take a blood test at the @entity57 in april 2013			1
he submitted the requisite urine sample			0
he claimed doping control officer @entity59 told him he could skip the blood test that day without facing any punishment so long as he explained the situation to @entity64 , head of the @entity66 's anti-doping program			1
@entity59 denied that claim but when the @entity68 -- @entity3 appealed his original 18 - month ban from the @entity66 -- issued its irrevocable verdict in november , it stated : " the @entity68 panel considered that the @entity73 should have informed the player in clearer terms of the risks caused by his refusal to undergo a blood test but that , despite the misunderstanding between the player and the @entity73 , there was no suggestion that mr. @entity3 intended to evade the detection of a banned substance in his system			1
" still @entity68 ruled that @entity3 " did indeed commit an anti-doping violation " and his sanction stood , though was reduced by six months			2
@entity3 still ponders the ordeal -- and " often			2
" " i think about it a lot , i ca n't lie , " said @entity3 , who took his blood test the next day			1
" for me it just feels unfair because i know what really happened in there			0
i know i never wanted to cheat			0
in the end i was totally clean and that 's what hurts me			0
" she informed me wrong and i paid a big bill for that			0
i was always compliant with the rules and anti-doping system			0
" @entity105 , @entity3 's coach , went as far as to say that what happened was " disgusting			1
" " it 's laughable , it 's disgusting , it 's incredible how it is , " @entity105 told @entity0			0
" he followed her advice			0
okay , he was negligent of the rules , but not a year 's worth			2
" i think it 's unbelievably exaggerated the whole thing			0
now we 're moving on and we 'll just prove to people something else			0
" in response to @entity105 's comments , @entity64 said that all players were treated " equally and fairly			0
" " mr. @entity3 was afforded , and took , the opportunity to provide evidence to the @entity128 tribunal and the @entity68 , both of which concluded that he had committed an anti-doping rule violation , " said @entity123 in an emailed statement sent to @entity0			2
@entity0 attempted to contact @entity59 but a message left with @entity132 -- whom @entity59 was working for -- was n't returned			0
early in his suspension , it was too painful for @entity3 to watch tennis , he said , but he has done more of that in the last few months			1
@entity50 , meanwhile , has continued to help @entity3			2
after defending @entity3 at the year - end championships , @entity50 has then practiced with his fellow @entity140 native			1
according to @entity3 , some of their hitting sessions took place in @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 -- just before qualifying began at those events			2
under the terms of his ineligibility , @entity3 was n't breaking any rules			1
" @entity50 helped me a lot when he had weeks of preparation , he always invited me , " said @entity3			2
" he really did a lot for me and i will never forget that			0
" reader has stuck by @entity3 , too			2
he told the @entity160 he was entitled to 100,000 euros ( $ 135,000 ) if @entity3 was ever found guilty of doping , but has n't cashed in			1
" i could have had a nice holiday , " @entity105 , a laid - back @entity162 , told @entity0 with a smile in june at the @entity164			2
" i did n't think it was justifiable to use that part of the contract			0
" i felt @entity169 had enough problems and i wanted to stand by him			0
now it 's up to me and particularly him , to get repayment			0
" matching his monetary success of 2011 wo n't happen for a while			0
" financially it 's been terrible , " @entity3 said			1
" when i start playing i wo n't be able to compete at the level i was , at the biggest tournaments , biggest prize moneys			0
" he tried to get a wild card into the main draw at next week 's @entity181 in @entity182 but was unsuccessful , and unless there are no shows , ca n't get into qualifying , either			2
the first priority for wild cards in qualifying are given to @entity191 players , vice tournament director @entity186 told @entity0			0
yet , " it would be a good thing for us if he gets into the main draw , " @entity186 said , presumably because of @entity3 's standing as a former top - 15 pro. " he 's going to need wild cards into anything , futures even , " said @entity105 , referring to the third rung of tennis ' professional ladder where some titlists in the first week of july received about $ 2,000			1
that 's a huge initial huge wage cut for @entity3 given first - round losers at @entity205 pick up $ 46,000			1
@entity3 's suspension came with at least one positive			1
he went back to school , studying sports management at @entity210 in @entity140 , and @entity105 said the rest @entity3 's body received should add a " couple of years " to his career			1
" it will take me another three or four years to graduate , " @entity3 said			2
" it was the first time i thought about what to do with myself after my tennis career because you stop doing what you love and all of a sudden i do n't have anything			1
a degree is " something that could be useful after my career , " @entity3 continued			2
but for now , @entity3 's goal is to re-establish himself at the elite level			1
@entity3 said he has been drug tested multiple times in the last year			1
if he 's unwell and asked to take a blood test again at a tournament , he knows what he 'd do			1
" well , i would definitely do it , " he said			0
" if i was told i must definitely do it or else i 'd get a ban , i would have done it back then			0
" for sure i learned a huge lesson			0
i will definitely pay more attention to this and try for it not to happen again			0
