-- the residents of @entity2 and @entity3 have voted to legalize the recreational use of marijuana , and all hell is about to break loose -- at least ideologically			1
the problem is that pot is still very much illegal under federal law , and the @entity11 administration must decide whether to enforce federal law in a state that has rejected the substance of that law			1
what makes this development fascinating is that it brings into conflict two important strains of political thought in @entity22 : federalism and moralism			1
federalists , who seek to limit the power of the federal government relative to the states and individuals , will urge a hands - off approach			1
moralists , on the other hand , strongly believe in the maintenance of an established social order and will argue for continuing enforcement of federal narcotics laws			1
the new laws will pit those who want a small federal government that leaves businesses and individuals alone against those who want the government to actively enforce a traditional sense of public morality in areas such as narcotics , abortion and limitations on gay marriage			2
one aspect of this conundrum is the near - total overlap between federal and state narcotics laws			1
simple possession of marijuana is made into a federal criminal case under 21 @entity57 , and federal law oddly categorizes marijuana as a schedule i narcotic , along with heroin and mescaline -- even as cocaine and opium remain on the less - serious @entity66 while federal law typically wo n't provide jurisdiction over a street robbery or even a murder , it does allow federal courts to imprison someone for carrying a small bag of marijuana , even when state law says otherwise			1
opinion : the end of the war on marijuana federal and state efforts to curb marijuana use through prosecution simply have n't worked			2
in 2010 , four out of five of the 1.64 million people arrested for drug violations were accused of possession , and half of those arrests were for carrying what were often very small amounts of marijuana			0
those hundreds of thousands of drug cases corresponded with an increase in marijuana use			0
if federal policy were about problem - solving , @entity2 would not pose a dilemma , because prosecuting marijuana cases has n't solved the problem of marijuana use			2
federal drug policy , though , is very much driven by moralism rather than problem - solving			2
after all , we have spent billions of dollars -- about $ 20 billion to $ 25 billion a year during the past decade -- and incarcerated tens of thousands of people to punish drug possession and trafficking without ever successfully restricting the flow of marijuana or cocaine			0
if we think tough drug laws solve the problem of drug use , we are deluding ourselves			1
rather , what sustains the effort is the bedrock belief that drugs are bad , and we must punish those who sell them or use them			0
mass incarceration is justified by the belief that those we lock up simply deserve it			0
that sense of retributive morality does not stop at state borders			0
@entity124 , though , demands that individual and state rights be honored above all but the most important federal imperatives			0
should marijuana be legal ? readers debate pot laws we are not a unitary state like many @entity133 nations , and part of the genius of the @entity22 experience is the delicate balance between federal and state powers desired by those wise men who crafted the mechanics of our government			1
the difference between federalism and the kind of moralism driving national narcotics policy is simply this : federalism is a central principle built into the structure of our government through the @entity151			1
@entity152 of marijuana use is not such a defining principle			0
to be true to our best values , federalism should win out			0
no doubt , the moralists will consider the regulations on marijuana " too important " to bow to federalism concerns , but their sway is limited			0
our recent elections show the moralists to be in decline , as those who fought limits on gay marriage won across the board at the same time that marijuana was legalized			0
as a federal prosecutor , i had the privilege of representing the @entity22 and a role in employing the singular power of prosecutorial discretion			2
the @entity11 administration should employ that discretionary power in line with our oldest and best principles and step back from continuing marijuana prosecutions in @entity2 and @entity3			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			0

@entity2 and @entity3 legalized recreational use of pot but it *'s* illegal under federal law
@entity183 : two ideologies clash over whether @entity22 should *override* new state laws
@entity183 : federalists say state laws must rule ; moralists say we need national drug laws
@entity22 must honor states , he says ; federalism is in @entity151 , pot *opposition* is not
