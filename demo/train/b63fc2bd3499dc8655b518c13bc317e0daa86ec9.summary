on july 17 , 1996 , their lives changed forever			2
@entity2 boarded @entity10 bound for his native @entity11 on his way to @entity13 to play professional hockey			1
" he called me , and he told me he was getting on the plane			2
and he asked me to marry him on the phone before he got on the plane , " @entity0 told @entity1 the next day			1
twelve minutes after takeoff from @entity21 , the plane exploded in midair off the coast of @entity24			1
two hundred thirty passengers were on board			2
" after we said our final ' i love yous ' ... about two hours later , my mom called , " @entity0 recalled recently			1
" she said , ' please tell me that @entity2 did n't go to @entity32 tonight			2
' " @entity0 immediately turned on the tv			1
" i just remember fire and really dark water			2
and at that point , my life stood still , " she said			2
" he was strong , he was young , and he definitely swam to shore			2
and i held on to that hope			2
and then the next morning it became a recovery mission			0
" about five weeks later , @entity43 's greatest fear was confirmed when @entity2 's remains were recovered from the bottom of the ocean			0
" one of the hardest things for me was just going home , " she said			0
" everybody is resuming life as normal but i had a huge hole in my heart , and i had a future planned with somebody and that was gone			0
" @entity0 looked for a support group in @entity7 but could n't find one			1
she spoke with mayor @entity59 , and he suggested she attend a meeting with families from @entity62 , which had exploded over @entity63 , @entity64 , eight years earlier			2

they got it , " she said			0

" we have 250 grief mentors from air disasters dating back to 1958 -- private , military and commercial air disasters , " @entity0 said			1

" the first night i was home , we were all in a small airport ... i thought he 's probably cold and in the woods and that nobody 's helping him			0
and i was completely panicked			0
" a year later , @entity107 was still grappling with the loss			2
" i realized that the world was moving on but in a lot of respects , i was n't , " she said			0
" @entity0 ended up pairing me up with another woman who was a mentor , who had lost her father in an aircraft disaster			1
" @entity107 's experience inspired her to help others			0
" to me , it was ' i got through this , ' " she said			0
" i wanted to be there to help other people see that there is a light at the end of the tunnel			0
" when planes go down , like @entity140 , which left 162 people dead in december , @entity0 and her team of grief mentors stand by ready to help			1
" every time we have the opportunity to speak about access on the news ... we get calls for help from people who have lost loved ones who did n't know we were there , " she said			1
@entity0 appeared on several @entity1 shows after the @entity140 crash			1
" every time these incidents occur we are walking with them , we remember , we are grieving with them , " @entity0 told @entity154 on @entity1 's " @entity155			1
" in addition to providing one - on - one support , the organization shares information with airlines and organizations to help them offer more effective emotional support after these types of losses			0
@entity0 also wrote the book " surviving sudden loss : stories from those who have lived it " as another tool families could use to deal with their grief			1
" this is a lifelong journey			0
... i feel so blessed that i 've been given the opportunity to be with these incredible people who come forward and volunteer their time , " @entity0 said			1
