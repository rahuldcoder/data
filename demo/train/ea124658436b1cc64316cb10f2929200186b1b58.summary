-- a fake editorial about @entity2 , supposedly by the former executive editor of the @entity4 , was making the rounds this weekend			1
it was mocked up so well that it even fooled at least one @entity4 staffer			2
the fake piece , written under the name of the @entity4 ' @entity11 , defended the controversial group known for acquiring , and publishing , secret documents from governments throughout the world			1
on sunday , the group said its supporters were behind the hoax , which was published on a web page that looks convincingly like a page on the @entity4 ' site			1
@entity2 ( @entity25 & co ) and our great supporters where ( sic ) behind the successful @entity4 banking blockade hoax on @ nytkeller , " @entity2 posted on its official @entity29 feed sunday			1
@entity11 , meanwhile , also said the thoughts were n't his			2
" there is a fake op - ed going around under my name , about @entity2 , " he wrote , in all - caps , on his @entity29 feed			1
" emphasis on ' fake			0
' as in , not mine			0
" the page was published with an opinion - nytimes.com url instead of nytimes.com			0
it linked back to the @entity4 site and resembled a real @entity4 opinion piece in almost every way			2
someone also created a fake @entity29 account for @entity11 , replacing one of the lowercase l 's in his name with a capital letter i , and tweeted out the editorial			1
the ruse fooled @entity55 , editor of the @entity56 , among others			1
@entity55 tweeted the faux post , then quickly deleted it			2
@entity2 founder @entity25 has taken refuge in the @entity60 since last month			2
he is wanted for questioning on @entity61 on sex abuse charges , which his supporters say are politically motivated			0
@entity25 , who denies the allegations , has said he fears that if he turns himself in , he 'll be sent to the @entity66			0
he has angered @entity66 officials by , among other things , publishing information allegedly documenting @entity66 cyberattacks on @entity71 and a @entity72 " kill list " of terror suspects			0
he has not been charged with any crime in either the @entity66 or @entity61			0
in the fake editorial , it appeared that @entity11 , who has been critical of @entity2 , had decided to support the controversial organization			1
" as those of you who have followed my turbulent relationship with @entity2 and its guru - in - chief @entity25 know , i am first in line when it comes to distancing myself from his brand of transparency without government checks and balances , " the fake post reads			1
" ( but ) you do n't have to embrace @entity25 as a kindred spirit to believe that what he did in publishing those cables falls under the protection of the @entity95			0
" the post links to a february column by @entity11 when he remarked on being repeatedly asked to speak about @entity2 because he was the editor who approved the use of some of its releases in @entity4 stories			1
" it 's amazing they keep inviting me to these things , since i 'm a bit of a spoilsport , " the real @entity11 wrote in that february column			2
" my consistent answer to the ponderous question of how @entity2 transformed our world has been : really , not all that much			0
it was a hell of a story and a wild collaboration , but it did not herald , as the documentarians yearn to believe , some new digital age of transparency			0
in fact , if there is a larger point , it is quite the contrary			0

fake editorial purportedly by @entity124 editor fools some on web
in it , the @entity4 ' @entity11 , a @entity2 critic , appears to support the group
@entity4 ' blog editor @entity55 *shared* it on @entity29 , before deleting post
on @entity29 , @entity2 takes credit for the ruse
