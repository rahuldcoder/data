-- @entity1 boasts arguably the most eye - catching warmup routine in golf : arms outstretched with a club above his head , squatting , usually with a cigar protruding from his mouth			1
known as " @entity1 , " his routine is clearly not in need of fixing -- on sunday the @entity13 became the first man over the age of 50 to win on the @entity16			1
his first victory at his home tournament , the @entity18 , came at his 27th attempt following a three - way playoff against @entity22 @entity21 and @entity23 of @entity24			1
while many of his peers are constantly pounding around in the gyms getting ready for the major tournaments , @entity1 's approach is more alternative			1
" i love to ski ( he broke his leg doing so in 2012 ) , i love to drink , i love to smoke , i love to compete and i love to have time with my friends , " he said			1
" i do n't want to stop any of those things			0
i 'm sorry but i 'm honest			0
" i do what i like in my life and i 'm not going to change that			0
if a major is coming then it will be ' wow ' but , if the major is not coming , i 'm still going to do what i like with my life			0
" it is an approach that has brought out the best in him in his advancing years in the sport			0
of his 21 career wins on the @entity16 , two - thirds of them have come in the last 10 years			1
the latest one , which he clinched on the first playoff hole , eclipsed his previous record for the oldest winner on the @entity16 at december 's @entity54 , which came less than a month before his 50th birthday			2
now into his sixth decade , he is targeting yet more records			0
the first is to become the oldest @entity58 player in september 's clash with the @entity60 -- which would beat a milestone set back in 1927 by @entity62 , who was 50 years , two months and five days old when he captained @entity63 in the inaugural event			2
also , should @entity1 win a major title -- he came close with his fourth place at last month 's masters -- he would beat the record of @entity69 , winner of the 1968 @entity71 aged 48			1
" i would love to make the @entity58 team , " admitted @entity1 , who is now sixth in the @entity73 points list as he seeks to reclaim his place , having been a non-playing vice-captain for 2012 's " miracle at @entity77			1
" " i would break all the records at 50			2
" as for this weekend 's victory , he added : " there 's no words to describe what it means to me			1
you need to be into my skin but i 'm not going to let you			0
" all the victories are special , all are unique , some of them give you more money , some less , but all of them are important			0
you play to win and when you make it you have to appreciate it			2
" @entity1 has no plans yet to become a fulltime member of the seniors ' circuit , though he won his debut event on the @entity60 @entity100 last month and has said he is likely to line up at july 's @entity101 at @entity102 a week after the third regular major of the season at @entity105			2
" i love to compete , " he said			0
" it 's the only think i know how to do properly in my life			0

@entity1 wins home @entity18 for first time
becomes first man over the age of 50 to win on the @entity16
@entity1 broke his leg in 2012 and spent the first few months of 2013 in *rehabilitation*
he says : " there 's no words to describe what it means to me "
