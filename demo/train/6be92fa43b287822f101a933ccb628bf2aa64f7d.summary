-- the co-pilot of a @entity3 flight that overshot the @entity6 , @entity7 , airport by 150 miles says he and the pilot were n't asleep and they were n't arguing			1
however , @entity10 , who spoke to @entity0 affiliate @entity11 from his @entity14 , @entity13 , home , would n't say much more friday			0
he said an investigation will reveal what took place			0
after repeatedly saying he could n't talk about the case , @entity10 said that contrary to media reports , " nobody was asleep in the cockpit			1
" but other than that , i can not tell you anything that went on because we 're having hearings this weekend , we 're having hearings on tuesday			0
all that information will come out then			0
" @entity10 said there 's been " a lot of misinformation that 's going on			0
things are being said that did n't happen , but i ca n't go into any details			0
" @entity37 188 -- an @entity38 carrying 144 people and five crew members -- flew past the @entity41 beginning about 7:56 et wednesday night while en route from @entity42 , @entity43			2
there were 78 minutes of radio silence			1
air traffic controllers re-established radio contact after the plane had flown about 150 miles past its destination			1
watch as a passenger wonders what was going on police who met the wayward jet said the pilots were " cooperative , apologetic and appreciative			1
" the airport police report , released friday , said officers asked flight attendants to keep passengers in their seats while they checked out the cockpit			1
the report identified the pilot as @entity64 and @entity10 as the first officer			0
" the pilot ... indicated they had become involved in conversation and had not heard radio communications , " the report said			2
" they indicated there had been no involvement from anyone in the cabin			0
" the report said , " both volunteered to a preliminary breath test with the result being .000 for both parties			0
" the lead flight attendant told officers she was unaware there had been an incident aboard , the report said			2
the @entity86 , which is investigating the incident , is hoping the plane 's cockpit voice recorder will either confirm the pilot 's account or provide evidence of another possible explanation , including whether the captain and first officer had fallen asleep			1
earlier , the @entity86 released a statement that said , " the crew stated they were in a heated discussion over airline policy and they lost situational awareness			1
" watch how the @entity102 drama unfolded the voice recorder is capable of recording only 30 minutes of audio , federal accident investigators said friday			0
the plane was in the air for another 45 minutes after radio contact was restored , meaning that if the recorder was working properly , anything the pilots would have said during the time they were not answering radio calls would have been recorded over			2
but a former accident investigator said the voice recorder may still provide valuable information , because the pilots could have discussed the earlier events on the way back to @entity6			2
the separate flight data recorder also could prove valuable because it would have recorded actions taken by the pilots during the 78 minutes they did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers , the investigator said			1
watch as a former @entity86 official calls the long silence " unacceptable " the safety board said friday that experts were reviewing the solid - state voice recorder			1
it said the recorder " captured a portion of the flight that is being analyzed " and added there would be no further comment .			0
