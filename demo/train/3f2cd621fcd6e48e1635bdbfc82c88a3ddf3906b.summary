-- chances are if you bought your favorite coffee in a paper cup this morning , that cup can not be recycled			1
50 billion cups in the @entity7 end up in landfills every year -- enough that if placed end to end , they would go to the moon and back roughly five times			1
@entity14 inventor @entity13 was puzzled by this and has now come up with an alternative to make the recycling process easier			1
most paper cups are made from cardboard with a thin layer of plastic tightly attached on to the cup			1
this keeps the drink warm and prevents the cardboard from becoming soggy			2
but it also makes the cup non-recyclable -- which comes as a surprise to many			2
a 2011 report by the @entity14 - based consumer group which ? found that 8 in 10 people in the @entity14 thought paper coffee cups could already be disposed of in paper recycling bins			1
the campaign group is now urging retailers to provide clearer information about recycling			0
@entity40 's @entity39 is different			0
" we went back a step , what we 'll do is make the cup out of cardboard , without any plastic on it and we 'll put a plastic liner in it afterwards , " he said			1
this way the plastic lining can then be easily separated in a recycling plant -- the liner gets stuck in the filters , while the cardboard goes through and can be recycled and used up to further seven times as newspapers			1
@entity13 said there will be no difference to the consumer			0
" it will taste the same , it will look the same , you can put your lips to it the same			0
instead of putting it in the general waste you put this in the recycling - that 's it , " he said			0
his company is now in talks with coffee shop chains and existing cup makers , in the hope the technology is adopted : " it 'll take us till next year to get going properly			2
so the idea is to license the technology to existing cup makers , they can use part of their existing machines and buy our machine and bolt it on as well			0
" environment campaigners are praising the idea			0
" this goes to the heart of sustainable business practice and gives us all the chance to make better choices when we buy our favorite drink , " @entity91 's @entity90 said .			0
