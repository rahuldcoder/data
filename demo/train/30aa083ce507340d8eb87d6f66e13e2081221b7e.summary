@entity0 -- he has n't even been sworn in , yet @entity4 's next prime minister has already changed the world 's biggest democracy			1
@entity8 's stunning , crushing victory at the polls this week reverses a trend that was beginning to define @entity4 -- the localization of politics			1
since independence in 1947 , with each passing year there have been new and increasingly influential regional parties catering to local interests , cultures , languages , beliefs , castes , religions			0
the result has been a steady dilution of power : in three decades , no single party has been able to form a national government on its own			0
instead , @entity0 witnessed the formation of a series of coalitions , sometimes beholden to the whims of fringe members			0
that trend has now been destroyed			0
@entity4 -- be they @entity33 or @entity35 , urban or rural , young or old -- have channeled their yearnings for a better - run country into one vision , one man , and one party			2
@entity8 's @entity41 ( @entity41 ) now has a resounding mandate to make clear , single - minded decisions			1
there are indeed hurdles to legislation -- for example , the @entity41 is not well - represented in the country 's upper house of parliament -- but such is the force of the @entity8 wave right now , few would want to get in the way			1
read more : who is @entity8 ? in recent years , the @entity4 story has soured ; as i 've written previously , @entity4 have bought into @entity8 's rhetoric of being someone who can turn things around			1
so , what are the big issues @entity8 's team need to deliver on ? here are three ways the new prime minister can address the things holding back @entity67 bring the nation 's infrastructure into the 21st century : given @entity4 's ambitions , and all the talk of @entity4 as a global power , consider where the country actually stands			1
according to the @entity76 's @entity75 , @entity4 ranks 85th in the world for basic infrastructure like roads and public services			1
on technological readiness , @entity4 -- the world 's so - called @entity82 back - office -- ranks 98th			1
on softer infrastructural issues like education and health , @entity4 ranks 102nd in the world			2
@entity4 have cast their votes this year demanding to see tangible improvements			2
for example , @entity4 has world - class ports ; but its roads are so poor that transporting goods becomes prohibitively expensive			2
or consider food : one - third of all food produced in @entity4 is spoiled and rendered useless before it reaches a consumer			2
@entity4 's supply - chain mechanisms are blighted by a lack of infrastructure and a system of middle men who delay delivery and force up prices			1
@entity8 will need to use a lot of political capital to clean up these systems			2
some of these could be done quickly ; some will take decades			0
@entity8 will need clear visions for short and long - term goals , perhaps involving the private sector to find solutions			2
make it easier to do business in @entity4 : ask any investor anywhere in the world about working in @entity4 and you 'll hear a familiar sigh			1
few countries impose as many restrictions and hurdles , and almost none require as many permits , permissions , and bribes to start a business			0
as i wrote earlier this week , the @entity128 ranks @entity4 134th in the world for ease of doing business			1
it 's a shocking label to carry , especially for a nation of @entity4 's lofty aspirations			1
one of @entity8 's greatest selling points has been his track record and energy in processing requests for new ventures ; he has flung open his home state 's doors to big business			1
@entity8 will be expected to do the same on a national scale			2
it seems like a logical progression , but adapting to the scale and diversity of this country will be a challenge			0
in @entity150 he kept some of the most important portfolios all to himself : home , industry , information , ports , general administration , science and technology , and climate change			0
put simply , he hoarded power			0
this will be next to impossible to do at the national level , at least not to the same extent			0
opinion : does @entity8 threaten secular and liberal @entity4 ? @entity8 will need to pick his deputies well , and learn to delegate			1
he will need to quickly appreciate the diversity of opinion in @entity4 -- even though its people were unified enough to give him an absolute majority			1
most of all , he will need to find ways and inducements to bring powerful state leaders on board -- without them , he too will find out why so many businessmen have begun to give up on @entity67 clamp down on corruption : the writer @entity177 says that in @entity4 one encounters " birth - to - death " corruption : you pay a bribe to get a birth certificate , and you pay another bribe to get a death certificate			1
along the way , life becomes a long series of bribe - taking and bribe - giving -- everyone is complicit			0
quite simply , @entity8 will need to clamp down brutally on corruption , even if it means outing a few skeletons in his own party 's closets			1
@entity8 could probably derive some inspiration from @entity198 under president @entity199 , which has been on a ruthless drive to out corrupt leaders			2
but the impacts of corruption in @entity4 permeate far deeper than they do in @entity198			1
it is said that @entity4 's " informal " sector generates half of the nation 's gdp , and accounts for nine - tenths of its jobs			1
what this means is that much of @entity4 's real income is not properly accounted for			1
for all his rhetoric about small government , @entity8 will need to find a way to expand the government 's coffers if he wants to fund big infrastructural projects			1
consider this : only 3 % of @entity4 are eligible to pay income taxes			0
of the ones who are eligible , many find loopholes to exploit			0
this will be a difficult culture to change			0
part of @entity8 's challenge will be to make a case for why his decisions will be beneficial in the long term , even if they cause pain right now			2
certain subsidies -- such as those for diesel and kerosene -- will need to be slashed			0
the @entity41 's supporters will balk			0
@entity8 will need to find the courage to stay the course			0
one could go on about the many big - ticket issues @entity8 will need to tackle : health care , foreign policy -- not least relations with the @entity246 -- education , jobs , defense , but the ones i elaborate on above are the ones @entity8 has been talking about the most -- and those are the ones he will be judged on in his first 100 days in office			1
one caveat : checks and balances may seem like hindrances , but overall , they are vital to the security of people			0
even with his undisputed mandate , @entity8 will encounter all kinds of checks -- on religious freedoms , on the judiciary , on constitutional rights , on human rights			2
on all these issues he will need to display patience and appreciation of the system , and a compassion and deftness of touch he has often failed to display in his home state			0
perhaps that will be his biggest internal challenge : to be strong , and yet be willing to appreciate the importance of dissent in a healthy democracy			0
@entity4 will give him a lot of time to adjust -- but not forever			0
