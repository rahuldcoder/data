-- when @entity2 announced its new reality series , " @entity4 , ' " many viewers flashed back to 2003 and the days of " @entity5 " -- a.k.a. the first time women were fooled into fighting for a man 's heart on tv , only to find out he was n't who he said he was			1
but other than the whole @entity13 angle , is there much of a difference between @entity5 and " @entity16 " ? people asked " @entity5 " winner @entity18 ( formerly known as @entity19 ) to chime in			1
as she put it , " just when i thought they 've covered every reality show idea ... @entity2 is at it again ! i suppose it has been a decade , so in all fairness , a good deceptive reality show was due			2
" @entity0 : bad heir day - ' @entity28 ' a royal ratings bomb despite the " feelings of uncertainty and insecurity " she claimed she felt while watching the new show , @entity18 still had some thoughts on the contestants			1
" at first glance , i like @entity37 , " she wrote			0
" she said something along the lines of how she does n't care to be with a prince , just someone who cares for her and treats her well and she seems genuine			2
@entity16 comes across as sincere , earnest and naturally uncertain of how , if at all , he can successfully pull off this hoax			0
and , the masquerade ball premiere could n't be more apropos : let the mystery and deception begin ! " as far as the other women were concerned , here 's what @entity18 had to say : " @entity2 has equally selected a fun mix of 12 personalities : overly confident , overly guileless and overly trusting			1
@entity52 , where do they find these women ( sympathetic smile ) ? " @entity0 : ' @entity28 ' - why the idea of a royal ' bachelor ' makes total sense that said , the ex-reality star admits , she personally " never felt bothered " by " @entity5 's " premise			1
" i was more caught off guard after seeing the first preview and learning the [ show 's ] working title , @entity64 , was changed to @entity5 , " she explained			1
" i felt like there was a lot more judgment directed at participants who would partake in a show with ' millionaire ' in the title			0
" so , will these girls really believe they 're dating a prince ? " it certainly feels a little far fetched , but i 'm sure some of the contestants will fall for the misrepresentation , " said @entity18			2
" others will likely know or at the very least , suspect , they are not dating the real @entity16			0
" one can only hope , right ? see the original story at @entity0			0
