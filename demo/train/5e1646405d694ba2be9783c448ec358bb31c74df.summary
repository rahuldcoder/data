@entity0 -- while international sanctions continue to mount against @entity5 and its nuclear program , the @entity3 administration acknowledged tuesday that the steps have done little to change @entity5 's behavior			1
national security adviser @entity9 said at a conference at the @entity11 that @entity5 is paying a steep price for its intransigence			1
growing international sanctions , diplomatic isolation and growing defense alliances in the region continue to ratchet up the pressure on @entity5 and have helped slow its nuclear efforts			1
but @entity9 also admitted that " the @entity5 regime has not fundamentally altered its behavior			1
" this month , the @entity23 questioned whether @entity5 's nuclear program is for peaceful energy purposes , as @entity5 maintains			2
in the most detailed report to date , the @entity23 found " credible " information that @entity28 has carried out work toward nuclear weapons , including tests of possible bomb components			0
despite @entity5 's failure to change its behavior , @entity9 thinks the @entity34 , working in concert with its international partners , will eventually have an impact on the @entity5 leadership if they remain persistent and unified			1
" we think it has an effect when they see that they are thoroughly isolated , " @entity9 said			2
but unity has been a problem			0
@entity47 and @entity48 in particular have been reluctant to support harsher sanctions against @entity5 and have effectively forced the @entity34 and @entity51 nations to settle for less punishing measures			1
however , @entity9 maintained that there is good coordination and cooperation with @entity47 and @entity48			2
" they have supported us on each of our sanctions , international sanctions at the @entity61 , " he said			0
" they have enforced those efforts faithfully			0
" @entity9 said it is important all options remain on the table			0
" over time , the goal , of course , would be to raise the price and force the choice , " he added .			0
