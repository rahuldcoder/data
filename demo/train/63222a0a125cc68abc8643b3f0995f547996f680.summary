-- the top proponent of the new @entity3 law targeting the state 's ethnic studies programs defends the controversial measure , which bans ethnic studies classes that " promote resentment " of other racial groups			1
@entity11 superintendent @entity10 told @entity0 's " @entity12 " on thursday that the legislation is " designed to get schools to teach kids to treat each other as individuals and not on the basis of what race they were born into			1
" @entity10 said he believes that the " fundamental @entity21 value is that we are individuals " and " not exemplars of the race we happen to be born into			1
what 's important is what we know , what we can do , what is our character			0
" the superintendent has been targeting an ethnic studies curriculum in @entity31 that he says " divided the kids into different races " -- african studies for african - americans , " @entity42 " studies for @entity38 youths and @entity40 studies for @entity41			1
" in the @entity42 studies , they were teaching kids that the @entity21 is oppressive , they were making them angry			1
they used a @entity50 book , the ' @entity49 , ' " he said			0
signed into law on tuesday , the new legislation forbids classes " designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group " that advocate " the overthrow of the @entity21 government " or " resentment toward a race or class of people			1
" it also forbids classes that " advocate ethnic solidarity " instead of treating pupils as individuals			1
the measure has drawn criticism from educators and citizens who say the classes do n't promote resentment			1
@entity74 human rights experts criticized the legislation , saying " everyone has the right to seek and develop cultural knowledge and to know and understand his or her own culture and that of others through education and information			0
" @entity85 , a democratic state legislator who appeared on " @entity12 " with @entity10 , disagreed with the superintendent 's contention that students were divided according to race or ethnicity			0
" the fact is very clear that these courses are open to all students			0
any student of any race and ethnicity can take an @entity98 - @entity21 class			2
similarly , they can take an @entity100 and learn about the history of @entity103 internment camps			0
that 's an important part of the @entity21 education system , " she said			2
@entity85 said the courses are n't designed for one race , and they help foster an understanding of different cultures			0
" i think it is important for students to learn about their own cultural heritage and to have the opportunity to learn about our cultures and ethnicities that make up the diverse and wonderful state of @entity3 , " she said			0
@entity10 said the state 's social studies standards " require all kids to learn about all different cultures			2
" he said they " should n't be ghettoized into certain cultures where they learn only about the culture of the race they have been born into			0
that 's contrary to @entity21 values			2
" the ethnic studies legislation comes on the heels of a new state immigration law that has led to calls to boycott @entity3 businesses and the state itself			1
the law requires immigrants in @entity3 to carry their registration documents at all times and allows police to question individuals ' immigration status in the process of enforcing any other law or ordinance			2
critics of the law say it will lead to racial profiling , while supporters say it involves no racial profiling and is needed to crack down on increasing crime involving illegal immigrants .			0
