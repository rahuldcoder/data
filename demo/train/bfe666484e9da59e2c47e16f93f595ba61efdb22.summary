-- farmers are on their way to tend their crops when a missile slams into their midst , thrusting shrapnel in all directions			0
a @entity9 drone , flying so high that the farmers ca n't see it , has killed most of them			0
none of them were militants			0
such attacks by @entity22 drones are common , the @entity17 ' special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights said friday in a statement on strikes in @entity26 's tribal region of @entity27			1
the rapporteur , @entity28 , told @entity0 the actions are of dubious international legality , despite the @entity22 ' assertions			2
" i 'm not aware of any state in the world that currently shares the @entity22 ' expansive legal perspective that it is engaged in a global war -- that is to say a non-international armed conflict with @entity37 and any group associated with @entity37 , wherever they are to be found , that would therefore lawfully entitle the @entity22 to take action involving targeted killing wherever an individual is found , " @entity28 said			1
the @entity42 and other @entity22 groups are questioning the legitimacy of the president @entity46 - approved drone program , and they 're looking for evidence for a legal battle			1
on friday , a @entity22 federal appeals court ruled the @entity9 must acknowledge the existence of any records related to military unmanned drone strikes targeting individuals , such as overseas terror suspects			1
the @entity42 and others had filed a @entity57 request , but the @entity9 refused to confirm or deny it had any such records , citing national security			0
@entity28 has just returned from @entity26 , where he listened to residents of @entity27 talk about terrifying encounters with one of @entity22 's weapons in the war on terror			1
" adult males carrying out ordinary daily tasks were frequently the victims of such strikes , " the statement from the @entity17 office for human rights said			2
first on @entity0 : @entity73 confronts @entity22 drone over @entity75 some @entity78 men dress the same as @entity80 members from the same region , hence the drone operators mistake them for terror targets , the statement said			1
it is also customary for @entity78 men to carry a weapon , making them virtually indistinguishable from militants to an outsider			0
a beard and a turban a @entity26 tribal elder who spoke with @entity0 noted hasty judgments based on appearances can be wrong			2
" just because i have a beard and wear a turban , does that make me part of the @entity80 ? " asked @entity94			0
the @entity22 has 8,000 drones , unmanned planes and helicopters flown by a remote control			1
they are outfitted with a video camera to help the operator spot targets and often armed with weapons used to neutralize them			0
president @entity46 has told @entity0 that a target must meet " very tight and very strict standards			1
" @entity9 director @entity111 has said that only in " exceedingly rare " cases have civilians been " accidentally injured , or worse , killed in these strikes			0
" reports back the @entity17 conclusion reports by independent groups corroborate @entity28 's account , concluding that drones mistakenly target and kill a significant number of civilians			1
the @entity122 estimates that in @entity26 , drones have killed between 1,953 and 3,279 people since 2004 - and that between 18 % and 23 % of them were not militants			1
the nonmilitant casualty rate was down to about 10 % in 2012 , the group says			0
a study by the @entity129 estimates that since 2004 , @entity26 has had 365 drone strikes that have killed between 2,536 and 3,577 people -- including 411 to 884 civilians			1
the study concludes that the strikes have killed far more people than the @entity22 has acknowledged , and traumatized many more innocent people			2
that trauma is destroying a way of life , @entity28 said			0
" the @entity78 tribes of the ... area have suffered enormously under the drone campaign			0
" and tribal law prescribes revenge for the killing of a tribe member , which serves to radicalize more young men against the @entity22 , he said			2
@entity26 considers the strikes counterproductive , illegal and a violation of its sovereignty			2
@entity0 's @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 contributed to this report			0

the @entity17 says the @entity22 stands alone in its legal perspective on drone attacks
@entity17 : drones kill @entity26 men doing everyday chores
@entity22 has 8,000 drones and unmanned planes flown by remote control
@entity46 says a target must meet " very tight and very strict standards "
