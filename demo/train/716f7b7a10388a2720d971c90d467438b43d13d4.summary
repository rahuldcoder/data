@entity0 -- western nations and @entity3 broached solutions over @entity6 's controversial nuclear program wednesday , the latest push to end the saber - rattling over the @entity10 's atomic aspirations			1
both sides , negotiating in @entity0 , delivered proposals in the latest round of talks between @entity3 and six nations -- the @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			2
the talks , a followup to negotiations last month , come amid a backdrop of tensions across the @entity27 over @entity3 's nuclear efforts			1
western powers fear that @entity3 may be trying to build nuclear weapons , despite its insistence that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes			1
the @entity34 has been using sanctions and diplomacy to try to stop @entity3 from producing nuclear arms			2
@entity6 threatened this year to close the @entity38 , a vital oil shipping lane , if sanctions were imposed on its exports of crude oil			2
@entity43 , which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal , has said it may attack @entity3 to try to stop @entity6 from developing nuclear weapons			1
the six nations are " putting forward a detailed proposal , which will include confidence - building measures that can begin to pave the way for @entity3 to demonstrate that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes and for it to comply with @entity56 ( @entity56 ) resolutions , " said a @entity47 official , who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the discussions			1
" this approach includes concrete step - by - step , reciprocal measures aimed at near - term action			0
we are looking to have detailed and serious discussions in @entity0 that strive to make progress towards these concrete steps , " the official said			0
asked whether relief from the tough @entity47 sanctions imposed on @entity3 will be on the table , the official said , " there is no expectation it will happen as a result of this meeting			2
@entity3 would need to take significant concrete action first			2
" the @entity47 official said bilateral talks between @entity76 foreign policy chief @entity75 and @entity3 's top nuclear negotiator , @entity78 , had concluded			1
a closing plenary session will be held thursday morning			1
when asked if there were a chance of a deal , another @entity47 official , who requested anonymity because of sensitive diplomatic discussions , said , " we 're not talking final deals , but solid progress			0
" @entity3 has submitted a package to the nations , with some , but not all , of the points addressing the nuclear issue , said a member of the @entity3 delegation who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the talks			2
details were not immediately available			0
a @entity99 spokesman said world powers are offering support for @entity3 economic and agricultural development and the country 's civilian nuclear program in exchange for cooperation			1
another idea on the table is an updated version of an earlier offer to swap enriched uranium for nuclear fuel , @entity76 officials said			0
there had been a proposal to swap most of @entity3 's low - enriched uranium for fuel rods to power a medical research reactor in @entity6			1
the proposals address the world community 's " concerns about the nature of their nuclear program , " said @entity126 , a spokesman for @entity127			1
" obviously , you have various @entity56 resolutions and reports from the @entity131 ( @entity131 ) that have found suspicions that they may be developing a military program , so our proposals on the table address those concerns , " @entity126 said			2
" we hope that they will come back and react positively to those proposals that we 've made and that we can really talk about the substance and get things moving			0
" @entity126 said 20 % uranium enrichment " is one of the issues that 's addressed " in proposals @entity127 put on the table			0
uranium enriched at 20 % is typically used for hospital isotopes and research reactors , but is also seen as a shortcut toward the 90 % enrichment required to build nuclear weapons			0
the @entity0 meeting takes place a day after the head of the @entity131 said he would soon sign an agreement with @entity3 , a sign that @entity6 may have agreed to broader inspections of its nuclear facilities			1
the talks come at a critical time for @entity3			2
the country 's economy has been crippled by sanctions imposed by the @entity164 , the @entity16 and the @entity76			0
because 80 % of @entity3 's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports , an embargo by the @entity76 set to go into effect in july will put further pressure on its economy			1
@entity78 was welcomed by the @entity173 foreign minister , @entity172 , on his arrival wednesday at @entity175 , the @entity171 said in a statement			0
meanwhile , @entity43 prime minister @entity177 , who has repeatedly raised alarms about @entity3 's nuclear development , said monday that the world powers " must show determination , not weakness " in the talks			1
" they do not need to make concessions to @entity3 , " he said in remarks distributed by his office			0
" they need to set clear and unequivocal demands before it			0
" @entity43 wants @entity3 to halt all uranium enrichment , give up all nuclear fuel it has enriched so far and dismantle the @entity194 enrichment plant it built into a mountainside			1
" only thus will it be possible to ensure that @entity3 will not have a nuclear bomb , " @entity177 said			2
opinion : reality check , please on wednesday , @entity43 defense minister @entity200 urged other countries to intensify the pressure on @entity3			2
" without a tightening of the sanctions , @entity3 will not stop nuclear program development , " he said			1
leaders of the so - called @entity207 -- the @entity16 , @entity208 , the @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity17 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity18 -- called saturday on @entity3 to comply with the requirements of the @entity131 and open its doors to nuclear inspectors			1
in a declaration , the @entity207 leaders said they welcomed the resumption of talks			0
the @entity131 has been demanding access to sites where @entity3 could be doing weapons - related testing			2
the agency 's director - general , @entity222 , met with @entity3 negotiator @entity78 in @entity6 on monday			1
" during the meeting , we discussed a wide spectrum of different issues , including nuclear disarmament , peaceful use of nuclear energy and strengthening ( the position of ) the agency , " @entity222 said tuesday in @entity224 after returning from the visit to @entity3			1
" during my stay in @entity6 , there was an important development on the structured approach document on which we were working since january , " he said , adding that a " decision was made by me and mr. @entity78 to reach the agreement on the structured approach			0
" @entity222 told reporters he raised the issue of access to @entity247 , the military complex believed to have been the site of high - explosive tests related to nuclear weapons research			0
" this issue will be addressed as part of the implementation of the structured approach document , " he said			0
@entity222 said differences remained , but @entity78 said they would not pose obstacles to signing the agreement			0
the " decision was made to conclude and sign the agreement , " @entity222 said			0
@entity3 's state - run @entity260 said that in meetings , both sides " discussed present problems more candidly , providing each other with proposals to remove ambiguities and expand cooperation			1
" foreign minister @entity272 " welcomed the new @entity131 approach toward @entity3 's nuclear issue based on mutual understanding and bilateral respect , " @entity260 reported tuesday			1
