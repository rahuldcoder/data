-- after months of speculation , one of @entity4 's worst kept secrets has finally been confirmed			2
@entity5 , the double world champion who recently left @entity6 , will rejoin @entity7 for the 2015 season , which gets underway in march			1
the @entity9 , who won back - to - back world titles with @entity11 in 2005 and 2006 , joins the @entity13 team after ending his four - year association with @entity6			2
he will be partnered by @entity15 , whose services were retained above @entity17 , who stays on as a test and reserve driver			1
between them , @entity5 and @entity15 have won three world titles , 47 grands prix and achieved 147 podium finishes from a combined 500 races			1
now 33 , @entity5 will be expected to boost @entity7 's fortunes after a season which saw it struggle to match the pace set by the all - conquering @entity29 team			1
" over the past year i have received several offers , some of them really tempting given the current performance of some of the teams that showed interest , " he said in a statement			0
" but , more than a year ago , @entity7 - @entity38 contacted me and asked me to take part , in a very active way , in the return of their partnership -- a partnership that dominated the @entity4 scene for so long			1
" between 1988 and 1992 , @entity7 and @entity38 won 44 grands prix out of 80 , with @entity47 and @entity48 winning all but one of the 16 races in one season			0
" i still remember , as a kid , the posters in my wardrobe , my toy cars in which i dreamed i would one day emulate @entity47 , and the kart that my father built for my older sister , and that i ended up falling in love with , " @entity5 added			0
" that kart had the livery of one of the most legendary partnerships in the history of @entity4 , @entity7 - @entity38 , the car that @entity47 drove , the same partnership to which i am now honored to join			1
" i am joining this project with enormous enthusiasm and determination , knowing that it may require some time to achieve the results we are aiming for , which is no problem for me			0
" it remains to be seen whether @entity7 's new engine partnership with @entity38 returns it to the top of the sport			0
@entity5 previously joined @entity7 in 2007 , but left after just one season due to tensions between him and then rookie teammate @entity84 -- the now @entity29 driver who was crowned 2014 world champion last month			1
this time around , @entity5 will be paired with the vastly experienced @entity15			1
the @entity86 , who won the 2009 drivers ' title with @entity89 , has signed a new deal to extend his four - year stay with the team			0
" i am extremely excited to be embarking on my 16th year in @entity4 and my sixth season for @entity7 , " said the 34 - year - old , whose future had been heavily debated in recent days			1
" like @entity5 , i am certain that @entity7 and @entity38 will achieve great things together , and i feel sure that , working together , all of us will pull incredibly hard to create a brilliantly effective winning team			2
" i admired @entity47 enormously , but , for me , it was the exploits of @entity48 that inspired me most as a boy			0
' the best driver lineup ' " the way he stroked those beautifully brutal red - and - white cars to grand prix wins and world championships was to my mind poetry in motion , and i have tried to emulate his driving style ever since			1
" being a part of new - look @entity38 is a wonderful opportunity for all of us and i am very pleased to have been invited to do my bit			0
in fact , i am absolutely raring to go			0
" " i am sure ( @entity5 and @entity117 ) will work extremely well together			0
" after plenty of uncertainty over whether @entity15 or @entity17 would be retained for 2015 , @entity7 chairman and ceo @entity118 is delighted with the pairing of two former world champions			1
" i can safely say that we now have by an order of magnitude the best driver lineup of any current @entity4 team , " he said			1
" we signed @entity5 a little ago , but we decided not to announce the fact until we had also re-signed @entity15 as his teammate			2
for many reasons , our negotiations with @entity15 took quite a long time			0
" the decision to retain @entity15 means @entity17 loses his seat after just one season in the sport			2
the @entity137 finished 71 points behind @entity15 in this year 's championship			0
" i am very glad that @entity17 will remain part of the team , " said @entity15			2
" he is a very quick driver and a really nice guy			0

two - time world champion @entity5 rejoins @entity7 , the stable he left in 2007
@entity5 will be partnered by @entity15 , retained above rookie @entity17
@entity7 chairman @entity118 *labels* the duo ' the best driver lineup ' of any @entity4 team
@entity17 will stay on as reserve and test driver
