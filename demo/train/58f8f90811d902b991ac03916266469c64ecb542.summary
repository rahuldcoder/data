@entity0 -- a bedbug outbreak at two trendy @entity0 retail shops has sounded the alarm among city residents and businesses , prompting calls for the city to examine how it deals with the prickly pests			2
@entity11 , a popular clothing store owned by @entity13 in the fashionable @entity15 neighborhood , remained closed friday after a bedbug infestation was found earlier in the week , according to company spokeswoman @entity17			1
and an @entity13 store in @entity19 also has been closed by an infestation			2
@entity21 and @entity13 said friday afternoon the problem in the @entity24 store had been taken care of and the shop will reopen saturday morning			2
" the company has requested guidance from the mayor 's office on how businesses in @entity34 should deal with this issue , " the company said in a news release			1
" in the meantime , the company 's first priority continues to be its customers and associates			0
" the incidents mirror a sharp overall spike in bedbugs in recent years , yet efforts to combat the problem have mostly focused on residential buildings , leaving the issue of contamination in commercial spaces largely ignored			1
" we 've had them in banks , grocery stores , movie theaters , judge 's chambers , schools , dentists ' offices -- everywhere , " said @entity50 of @entity51 , an exterminating company in @entity34			1
the problem , according to @entity50 , is that bedbugs carry a stigma , which causes many cases to go unreported			1
" it 's like a do n't ask , do n't tell policy , " he said			0
" people do n't tell their employers that they have bedbugs in their house " -- bedbugs that can hitch a ride to the workplace			1
according to the @entity77 , it issued 4,811 violation notices to residential landlords for bedbug infestations in 2009 , compared with 82 in the 2003 - 2004 fiscal year			2
for the first half of 2010 , 1,976 bedbug violation notices have already been written			2
however , such statistics represent only a fraction of bedbug cases in the city , as they come almost exclusively from buildings in the rental market			0
owners of bedbug - infested residences are less likely to call 311 , the city 's non-emergency hotline , which then notifies the @entity94			1
further , landlords of commercial structures are currently not obligated to report bedbug infestation			1
state assembly member @entity98 , who recently sponsored legislation to require landlords of apartment buildings to disclose information about an apartment 's bedbug history to potential tenants , plans to address the matter of bedbugs in businesses , though she admits doing so will be tricky			1
" people buy a shirt , leave it hanging in their apartment , a bug gets on it , and then they go to work			0
" if you buy a piece of clothing you should assume it 's bug free , but it 's hard on the retailer to assure that it is , because how would they know			0
" treating bedbugs can be extremely expensive , and no insurance policies cover them			0
" it would be cost prohibitive on both sides , " @entity98 said			0
the rise in bedbug cases is not exclusive to @entity0			0
last year , the federal @entity128 sponsored a bedbug conference in @entity130 , @entity131			0
speaking to a crowd of 230 academics , agency employees and exterminators , @entity132 , an agency spokesman , said the incidence of infestation in the @entity139 has tripled since 2005			0
despite their name , bedbugs need not live in beds			1
they generally live within 10 to 20 feet of their hosts and avoid light , preferring the dark security of spaces behind headboards , under baseboards and behind hanging pictures .			0

bedbug infestation shuts down 2 stores in *upscale* @entity34 areas
the *critters* have become a growing problem in recent years
@entity160 so far has been on residences , but the bugs can hitch a ride to work
despite the name , bedbugs need not live in beds
