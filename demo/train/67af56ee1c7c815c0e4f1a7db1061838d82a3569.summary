@entity0 -- while space travel still gets a lot of attention , not enough attention has been accorded to a major new expedition to the deepest point in the ocean , some 7 miles deep -- the recent journey by @entity10 , on behalf of @entity11			1
the cover story of the prestigious journal @entity14 lays out the " @entity15			2
" " @entity22 " recently ran a story about the dire effects on @entity19 's space industry of scaling back our extraterrestrial endeavors			1
@entity23 gained attention earlier this year by calling for building a permanent base on the moon			2
and president @entity27 has talked of preparing to eventually send @entity28 into orbit around @entity30			1
actually , there are very good reasons to stop spending billions of dollars on manned space missions , to explore space in ways that are safer and much less costly , and to grant much higher priority to other scientific and engineering mega-projects , the oceans in particular			1
the main costs of space exploration arise from the fact that we are set on sending humans , rather than robots			1
the reasons such efforts drive up the costs include : a human needs a return ticket , while a robot can go one way			0
space vehicles for humans must be made safe , while we can risk a bunch of robots without losing sleep			1
robots are much easier to feed , experience little trouble when subject to prolonged weightlessness , and are much easier to shield from radiation			0
and they can do most tasks humans can			0
@entity65 astronomer royal @entity64 writes , " i think that the practical case ( for manned flights ) gets weaker and weaker with every advance in robotics and miniaturization			1
it 's hard to see any particular reason or purpose in going back to the moon or indeed sending people into space at all			1
" nobel laureate @entity77 calls manned missions " an incredible waste of money " and argues that " for the cost of putting a few people on a very limited set of locations on @entity30 we could have dozens of unmanned , robotic missions roving all over @entity30			1
" the main argument for using humans is a public relations one			0
as @entity97 puts it in foreign affairs , " @entity91 's latest space proclamations could conceivably produce another ' @entity92 ' for the @entity28 , spurring the country into action after a relatively fallow period in its space efforts			1
" also , astronauts are said to inspire our youth to become scientists and explorers			0
however , it is far from established that we can not achieve the same effects by making other r&d projects our main priority			1
take the oceans , about which we know much less than the dark side of the moon			0
ninety percent of the ocean floor has not even been charted , and while we have been to the moon , the technology to explore the ocean 's floors is still being developed			1
for example , a permanent partially - submerged sea exploration station , called the @entity117 , is currently in development			2
the oceans play a major role in controlling our climate			0
but we have not learned yet how to use them to cool us off rather than contribute to our overheating			0
ocean organisms are said to hold the promise of cures for an array of diseases			2
an examination of the unique eyes of skate ( ray fish ) led to advances in combating blindness , the horseshoe crab was crucial in developing a test for bacterial contamination , and sea urchins helped in the development of test - tube fertilization			0
the toadfish 's ability to regenerate its central nervous system is of much interest to neuroscientists			0
a recent @entity148 study concluded that the drug eribulin , which was derived from sea sponges , is effective in combating breast , colon , and urinary cancer			2
given the looming crisis of water scarcity , we badly need more efficient and less costly methods to desalinate ocean water			2
by 2025 , 1.8 billion people are expected to suffer from severe water scarcity , with that number jumping to 3.9 billion by 2050â € ” well over a third of the entire global population			0
if the oceans do not make your heart go pitter - patter , how about engineering a bacteria that eats carbon dioxide -- and thus helps protect the world from overheating -- and excretes fuel which will allow us to drive our cars and machines , without oil ? i can not find any evidence that people young or old , @entity28 or citizens of other nations , would be less impressed or less inspired with such a breakthrough than with one more set of photos of a far away galaxy or a whole @entity183 full of stars			1
space enthusiasts claim that space exploration has generated major spinoffs for our life right here on @entity190			1
@entity97 quotes president @entity27 suggesting that the @entity211 mission " produced technologies that have improved kidney dialysis and water purification systems ; sensors to test for hazardous gases ; energy - saving building materials ; and fire - resistant fabrics used by firefighters and soldiers , " and adds a few more innovations to the list : " digital imaging , implantable pacemakers , collision - avoidance systems on aircraft , precision @entity199 eye surgery , and global positioning satellites			0
" of course , the space environment is radically different from the one on @entity190			2
materials and technologies that are suited for a vacuum , zero gravity , and extreme cold and heat are not the ones we typically can use on @entity190			0
opinion : @entity220 's moon colony lost in the laughter @entity222 , professor of @entity223 at the @entity224 , notes " government agencies -- particularly those such as the @entity228 and @entity227 that are continually pressured to justify their activities -- tout the spin - off value of their investments in sometimes quite extravagant claims			0
" products such as @entity236 , @entity237 , and @entity238 that are often cited as spinoffs of space technology did not actually result from the space program			1
space promoters tell us , once every few months , that there are signs that there might be or has been water on one of the planets that might make " life " possible			2
i wonder if some of those who hear these reports interpret them to mean that we expect to find a civilization out there , one that we could ally with , say against the @entity91			0
what scientists are really talking about is organic material , the kind found in any compost -- not a reason to spend billions of dollars of public funds			0
in short , do not cry for @entity30			0
it is not going away			0
we can send @entity268 to explore it and still keep a whole pile of dough for important and inspiring exploration missions right here on @entity190 , starting at the beach nearest you			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity277 .			1

many voices have suggested @entity28 should *reinvigorate* its space program
@entity277 says there are more pressing priorities on earth than in space
manned missions are much less cost effective than robotic exploration , he says
@entity277 : exploring the ocean , much of which is *uncharted* , is an urgent priority
