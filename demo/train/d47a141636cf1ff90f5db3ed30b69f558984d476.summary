at the @entity0 , one does not stand stiffly in front of musty exhibits and read tiny placards			1
there is no room for boredom or passively observing			0
the installations at this interactive science museum are hands on -- they require touching , building , playing , experimenting and thinking			1
and in the @entity0 's shiny new space , the experience is just as much for adults as it is for children			1
on wednesday , the doors open on the @entity0 's first new home in its 44 years , the $ 300 million renovated pier 15 on the @entity16 , @entity18 's eastern stretch of waterfront			1
it is three times larger than the old museum , the cavernous exhibit hall at @entity18 's @entity24 , which was originally built for the 1915 @entity25			1
the @entity0 was originally opened in that location in 1969 by physicist @entity27			1
the new quarters have taken the original spirit and contents of the old @entity0 and given them a sophisticated makeover			1
the building has sweeping views of @entity35 , the city skyline and the @entity37 's new nightly light show			1
though the @entity0 costs up to $ 25 to enter , the 330,000 - square - foot museum is rimmed with free public space : a wind sculpture , a giant sundial and wooden pylons in the water that track the tides and colors of the bay			1
a bridge next to the pier doubles as an art installation , enveloping the area in a thick artificial fog once an hour			0
inside , 600 exhibits fill the bright space , about 400 of which made the move from the old location			1
some old favorites are dusted off and given new life , like a wonderful giant concave mirror that plays tricks on the eyes and the ears			2
a brand new exhibit that 's bound to be a hit lets you recreate past rainstorms , down to the size and speed of the raindrops			2
the installations dabble in every scientific discipline , including electricity , sensory perception , weather , light , astronomy and sociology			0
they employ everything from magnets , pendulums and electricity to dancing , awkward social interactions , algae and a cow eyeball			0
there are artificial tornadoes in glass tubes , a creepy video art installation , a cooperative @entity90 game , and a place to send text messages to fish			0
the exhibits stimulate the brain without requiring any right or wrong answer , happy to leave the lessons open to interpretation			0
" the @entity0 is really a laboratory , " said senior scientist @entity99 , who has been with the @entity0 for 41 years			2
" we 're not making objects			0
we 're making activities ; we 're doing			0
" the culture of the @entity0 has long been intertwined with the @entity105 , the @entity106 festival that celebrates do - it - yourself projects			2
and its new shop , tinkering space and learning space expand on that maker spirit			0
the area where exhibits are tested and built with an impressive collection of large machinery is situated at the heart of the museum , now completely open so anyone can watch and chat up the staff and students at work			2
tinkering and learning spaces invites visitors to build their own creations , such as animations or elaborate paths for marbles , while teenage employees in orange vests circulate around the floor to offer guidance			0
the best new additions focus on the @entity106 's history and ecology			0
a new glass observatory at the end of the pier has killer views and exhibits specific to the location , such as tactile displays explaining the tides and the bay 's unique weather systems			2
even the building itself is a giant science experiment			1
there are sensors all around , in the nearby water and on the roof , that collect scientific data such as the amount of dissolved carbon dioxide in the bay			0
this is gathered to track ocean acidification and shared with schools and scientific institutions			0
all the data will also be available for free on the @entity0 's website			1
furthermore , the @entity0 aspires to make the pier a net zero building , meaning it will eventually generate as much energy as it uses			1
it has 6,000 solar panels on the roof that can generate 1.3 megawatts of power , and it uses seawater from the bay to cool and heat the building			0
the staff is still getting acquainted with the new space and discovering the best ways to manage power , such as identifying the most efficient times to open and close the window shades			0
one early discovery : it 's cheaper and easier to pump in the seawater during high tide			0
education remains a major focus of the @entity0 , which hosts webcasts , builds apps , trains science teachers and sells exhibits to other museums around the world			1
at the front of the building , a new forum will host music events , movie nights and science lectures			2
when the doors open on wednesday morning , crowds of fans will find that the unique atmosphere , which people loved about the original @entity0 , made the move intact .			1

@entity18 's @entity0 *reopens* wednesday in a $ 300 million new home
the interactive science museum , on the city 's @entity207 , has 600 exhibits
the museum has a grownup feel that makes it as much fun for adults as for kids
even the building itself is a giant science experiment , with sensors all around
