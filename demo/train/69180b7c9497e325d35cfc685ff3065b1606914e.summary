@entity0 -- the apologies issued by @entity3 and @entity5 manager @entity4 on sunday are a sign that the @entity10 club 's @entity8 owners are finally stepping in to sort out a situation that has festered for too long , says a leading @entity8 sports writer			1
" this story got attention in the media in the @entity8 -- the @entity16 , the @entity17			0
these are papers ( @entity19 , @entity5 's principal owner ) reads , " @entity21 's @entity20 told @entity1 's @entity22			1
the controversy started when @entity5 striker @entity3 refused to shake hands with @entity26 's @entity25 before the start of an @entity29 match on saturday			1
@entity3 , a @entity30 international , was widely criticized for the snub			2
it came as they met face to face for the first time since he was given an eight - game ban for racial taunts directed at the @entity40 at an earlier fixture between the two clubs in october			0
@entity26 manager @entity43 called @entity3 a " disgrace " while @entity5 managing director @entity44 was angered by his own player 's actions			1
@entity19 -- co-founder of @entity48 , which also owns baseball 's @entity49 -- has n't said anything publicly yet			0
however , @entity20 said the sunday apologies were a result of the owners ' intervention			2
the @entity57 club denied suggestions on monday that the statements were prompted by the club 's shirt sponsors @entity62			0
@entity20 remains surprised at how @entity5 have handled the affair from the outset			1
" when we saw the lengthy suspension issued to @entity3 , the pr department from @entity5 issued one of the worst pr statements i 've ever seen , " @entity20 said			1
released in december last year , after the @entity71 handed down its eight - match ban and a Â £ 40,000 ( $ 62,000 ) fine on @entity3 , the @entity57 club said it was " very surprised and disappointed " with the decision			1
" i think that gave @entity3 the feeling that he was in the right in this situation and that continued up into what we saw last weekend , " @entity20 said			1
he believes @entity5 should have just accepted the penalty and moved on			2
" i 'm surprised that the ownership group of @entity5 , which is well - versed in @entity8 sports , let this go on this long , " @entity20 said			2
" my feeling is that maybe that 's connected to the relationship between the previous @entity8 owners at @entity5 and the fans and club , and maybe not wanting to be seen as meddling , " he said			2
" but they should have meddled along time ago and start putting things in the right direction			0
this took far too long to happen			0
" @entity19 is scheduled to attend the final of the @entity95 when @entity5 take on second division @entity97 at @entity98 on february 26 , but some media reports have speculated that he will perhaps fly over earlier			0
whether or not this turns out to be true , @entity20 said @entity19 and the ownership group have always made one thing clear			0
" @entity5 needs to be making its news on the field by winning and not with this other stuff			0
