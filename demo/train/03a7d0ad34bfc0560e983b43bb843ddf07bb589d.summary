the officials made him wait for about 40 minutes before interviewing him for another 20 minutes , he said			0
" i kept asking them what was this all about , and then one guy interviewed me and he was so confused , he had no idea what he was saying , " @entity8 told @entity0 by phone from @entity20 , another stop on his trip			0
" he was talking about some fund - raising , so i asked him to come to the point , and he said , ' we 're worried you might use violence against drones			0
' i mean , it was so ridiculous , i did n't even know how to answer it			0
" @entity8 : " we 'll sweep the election " @entity8 missed his flight , but he eventually made it to @entity15 , and later @entity20 , for fund - raisers for his political party , @entity42			1
he has two more fund - raisers on the schedule , in @entity45 and @entity46 , before he returns home to @entity2 , @entity8 said			2

in recent years , the @entity4 government has sharply stepped up the use of drone attacks in @entity2 's mostly ungoverned tribal region , widely believed to be a safe haven for militant groups fueling the insurgency in @entity75			1
