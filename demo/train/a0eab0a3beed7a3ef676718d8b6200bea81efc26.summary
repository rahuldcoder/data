-- when my son was in middle school , i remember attending one of his school band concerts that was n't very good			1
in fact , it sucked			2
at times , it sounded as if half the band was playing one song and the other half was playing something totally different			2
and because i do n't want my son to grow up to be a loser , i told him straight out what i thought			1
" how was it ? " he asked			2
" it was pretty bad , " i said			2
" i know , right ? " my son agreed , smiling			2
" we 're not good at all			2
" and then we both laughed until we had tears in our eyes			0
i do n't claim to know everything about parenting , but i do know parents do their children a disservice by constantly sugarcoating their shortcomings to protect their feelings			1
i ca n't think of a more surefire way to raise a loser than not allowing a child to learn what it really takes to be a winner			1
not that everything in life is a competition			0
but if children ca n't handle competition when it 's necessary , or take some criticism , or never strive to be better because their parents inadvertently programmed them to believe they are already the best even when they 're not , then they are in for some serious shocks and bumps down the road			1
that 's the part of the discussion that 's missing from all the chatter about @entity49 's controversial " @entity50 " commencement speech			1
he did n't call the @entity52 of 2012 a bunch of lowlifes who wo n't amount to anything			1
rather , he was adjusting their lenses so that they could see the world they were about to enter more clearly			0
" across the country no fewer than 3.2 million seniors are graduating about now from more than 37,000 high schools , " @entity61 said			0
" that 's 37,000 valedictorians ... 37,000 class presidents ... 92,000 harmonizing altos ... 340,000 swaggering jocks ... 2,185,967 pairs of @entity71			1
but why limit ourselves to high school ? after all , you 're leaving it			0
so think about this : even if you 're one in a million , on a planet of 6.8 billion that means there are nearly 7,000 people just like you			0
" one man 's " ouch " is another man 's " right on brother , " and you can count me among the latter			1
my son is special ... to me			0
he is special to his mother , grandparents , aunts , uncles and friends			0
but he is not special to everyone , and he is not great at everything			0
if the students at @entity98 did n't know this before their last moments of high school , i am glad @entity61 was there to help them out before life taught them that lesson in less forgiving ways			1
some folks have faulted @entity61 , an @entity107 teacher at @entity98 , for his tough words			1
sure , the job of high school teachers is not to tear down students ' self - esteem			0
but it 's certainly not to inflate students ' sense of self - worth with a bunch of unearned compliments and half - truths			1
there is a middle ground where " how things are " and " how things can be " meets			1
it is at this middle point where growth happens			0
but if parents , teachers and the other adults in a child 's life never acknowledge " how things are " -- no matter how good the intention may be -- then they are denying that child an opportunity to mature , to develop a strong sense of self - confidence that can only be earned by recognizing shortcomings and dealing with disappointments and failures			1
" and i hope you caught me when i said ' one of the best , ' " @entity61 said			0
" i said ' one of the best ' so we can feel better about ourselves , so we can bask in a little easy distinction , however vague and unverifiable , and count ourselves among the elite , whoever they might be , and enjoy a perceived leg up on the perceived competition			0
but the phrase defies logic			0
by definition there can be only one best			0
you 're it or you 're not			0
" which is why @entity61 also talked about the importance of pursuing passions for the sake of passions , rather than seeking accolades or striking off items from an arbitrary checklist			0
accolades and lists may tell us about accomplishments , but life is meant to be experienced , not just accomplished			0
it 's like the difference between reading books for the sake of reading and reading books just to get a good grade			1
tell me , once you 're done with school , are you then supposed to be done with reading books ? i sure hope not			0
@entity61 's point was that students should focus less on being seen as special and instead understand that living life is special in and of itself			1
as @entity185 so eloquently stated in his poem " if " : if you can dream -- and not make dreams your master ; if you can think -- and not make thoughts your aim ; if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two imposters just the same ; the synopsis of " @entity195 " may seem scathing , but i found the speech to be quite uplifting , and i shared it with my son			1
he has another three years to go before graduating from high school , but i always like to remind him that his family and friends think the world of him -- and for the most part , just about everyone else on this planet does n't give a damn about him			2
that 's not mean or cruel , good or bad , that 's just the reality of life			2
and that 's ok -- everyone is special to someone , but no one is special to all			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			1

@entity218 found teacher 's " @entity222 " speech to grads uplifting
@entity218 : parents do their kids a disservice by sugarcoating their shortcomings
he says if kids do n't know how to deal with failure , they will not grow and mature
@entity218 : best way to raise a winner is to expose your kid to how things really are
