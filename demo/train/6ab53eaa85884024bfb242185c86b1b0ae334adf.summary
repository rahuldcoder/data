-- aquatic ecologist @entity1 has the most unusual of jobs			0
he 's traveling from community to community along the @entity5 , teaching @entity7 fishermen and farmers about the @entity10 crayfish			1
@entity11 : a blight , but maybe also a boon for @entity7 's @entity5			1
that 's because @entity7 's best - known river is suffering from a crayfish invasion			1
it 's a native of @entity18 and relatively new to @entity7			2
now it 's clawing and burrowing is damaging @entity5 river fishing and farming industries			1
" in the 1980 's somebody came to me and said that there was a new creature in the @entity5 , " says @entity1			2
" after two days of examination , we determined it was the fresh water crayfish			2
it has no natural predator in the @entity5			2
" with no natural predator , scientists say , the crayfish was free to roam from where the @entity5 meets @entity7 's @entity36 coast , down toward the arid nation 's border with @entity39			1
the @entity5 's warm waters and abundant food supply helped the crayfish evolve , @entity1 says , to reproduce at twice the rate of other species			1
food supply , @entity7 scientists argue , is the source of the problem - and oddly , a possible solution to a growing crayfish threat			1
@entity5 fishermen despise the crayfish because it uses powerful double claws to cut through nets , and then help themselves to the catch of the day			1
" in an hour , a half hour - just ten minutes - the crayfish can claw my fish to death , " says @entity55 a 56 - year old fisherman who says he 's been tossing his nets into the @entity5 since he was a child			1
" my catch is worthless			0
" the @entity11 species can also burrow up to three feet underground			0
@entity64 researchers say the crayfish infestation of burrows is causing segments of the @entity69 's water canal network to collapse			2
in a country where temperatures can soar above 105 degrees @entity73 , water is too precious an agricultural resource to leave to threat from small - clawed crustacean			0
many @entity7 so despite the crayfish , it is known locally as " the cockroach of the @entity5			1
" theories on just how the @entity10 crayfish found its way to the @entity83 have reached urban legend status			0
but it is widely accepted by scientists studying the crayfish invasion that this all started when an @entity7 businessman attempted to expand his fish farm industry by investing in shrimp			1
" he bought what he thought were [ shrimp ] eggs to hatch in his fish farm , " @entity1 says with a wry smile			0
" when they hatched into crayfish , they ate all the fish , then burrowed through mud partitions into neighboring fish containments and ate those fish too			0
" as the story goes , the businessman was so enraged that he took the crayfish and dumped them in the @entity5			1
from blight to disease defense @entity1 and other researchers at @entity64 's zoology department are looking at the bright side			0
@entity1 has joined with @entity10 research institutions to determine there is an unexpected benefit to the crayfish invasion -- the crustaceans are a natural defense against bilharzia , a parasitic disease that can cause damage to human organs			1
@entity124 is spread by a @entity5 river snail that carries the bilharzia larvae			1
the larvae can penetrate human skin -- most easily when people living along the @entity5 wade through stagnant riverbanks			2
despite decades of government awareness campaigns -- @entity7 's legendary singer @entity132 died of bilharzia complications in 1977 -- the water - born disease still affects millions of @entity7			1
as @entity7 @entity137 researcher @entity136 walks along the @entity5 's west bank outside of @entity139 , he points a few @entity7 women calf - deep in the water , washing carpets			1
prime candidates , he says , for catching the bilharzia infection			0
" we must give more attention to public awareness -- and the importance of the crayfish to make the people of the @entity5 like it and put it everywhere , " @entity136 says			1
@entity136 says it 's because the bilharzia snail is the crayfish 's favorite treat			2
@entity64 ecologist research seems to back that claim			0
" we put some fish , lamb , plants , dead chicken -- we found the first thing [ the crayfish ] selected was the snail , because the shell is very thin , " @entity1 says			0
he argues areas of the @entity5 where there are more crayfish , human bilharzia infection rates are low			1
@entity1 is telling crayfish awareness workshop participants that the crayfish is the answer to spiraling food prices			0
high in protein and cheap to buy , crayfish by the kilogram is making its way to @entity139 's street markets			0
@entity1 encourages fisherman to set crayfish traps in their fishing areas , to keep the crayfish out of their nets			2
sponsored by a grant from the @entity184 , @entity1 's workshops include a buffet tasting of crayfish cuisine , including a crayfish boil that could put @entity188 to shame			0
but judging by the frowns on the faces of some fishermen and farmers , it is clear it 's hard from some workshop participants to shake the cockroach connotation			0
according to the @entity198 , the crayfish meat industry is responsible for a $ 120million/year impact on @entity18 's economy			0
@entity1 says if @entity7 can develop a similar industry , the profits could be considerable			2
" you see in @entity18 they are eating it , cooking it -- there are many festivals for the crayfish			0
we need to do the same here , " @entity1 says .			0

imported crayfish *devastating* fishing catches in the @entity5
yet it could provide means to help combat spred of parasitic disease bilharzia
potential to provide new industy in @entity7 if seen in more *positive* light
