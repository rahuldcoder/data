-- for the better part of a decade , superheroes on the big screen have been big business ( " @entity5 " the most recent example )			1
on tv , however , keeping audiences coming back each week for the exploits of those with superpowers has been a far trickier task			1
it 's been a long time since " @entity13 , " " @entity14 , " " @entity15 " and " @entity16 " hit prime time			1
one show that has been able to get it right is " @entity23 , " which begins its record - breaking tenth season friday night on the @entity21 ( that would be the longest consecutively running sci - fi show )			2
what began as a revised history of @entity27 's teen years in @entity23 has come a long way over the years , with @entity29 fighting crime in @entity31 as a rarely - seen hero called " the @entity33 , " the introduction of @entity35 , and other superheroes occasionally joining the fray			2
at the same time , what was once one of the highest - rated dramas on tv , " heroes , " progressively lost viewers , ending its run on @entity44 after four seasons			1
but that does n't mean that networks are giving up on the genre : two more series , one with a caped crusader and another about a superheroic family are coming soon			2
so what are some of the secrets to success for superhero tv ? we asked producers and cast members of some of these series to find out			1
make your superheroes believable when " @entity23 " started , the writers had a slogan : " no flights , no tights			1
" their version of @entity29 would n't take up the mantle of @entity27 , or even @entity70			2
instead the @entity72 - turned - @entity21 series would focus on human drama			2
executive producer @entity74 said , " [ series creators @entity75 and @entity77 ] created a world you could see walking into every week			2
even though we 're in @entity31 and we 're really touching on the @entity27 world , it 's still a world where you can see yourself having coffee with the characters			1
" " it started out being about a family in @entity88 struggling to make ends meet , " added fellow executive producer @entity85			1
" we always emphasize the emotions			2
at its heart , i hope it would touch people and give them a place to come home to			1
" despite appearances by more and more characters wearing elaborate costumes ( @entity102 and @entity103 , for example ) , @entity74 and @entity85 say that they have always grounded the show in a real place			1
" we all could relate to the @entity29 at the start of the show , " said @entity74			2
" it 's great to watch that kid see people in costumes and see people flying with wings , as he interacts with them and we see that in his eyes			2
" another show that hopes to emphasize the humanity in the superhuman ( without costumes as well ) is @entity122 's new series " @entity123 " ( premiering september 28 )			2
in it , @entity124 and @entity125 play the heads of a family who find themselves having been granted extraordinary powers following an accident			2
back in july , @entity124 described it as " a family show wrapped in a police procedural wrapped in the superhero genre			2
" " the first season should feel like the first act of a superhero movie , " said " family " producer @entity136			2
" the slow discovery of what it means , and how it affects your real life ... like yes , i can run fast , but i can also make breakfast fast ! you can have the fun stuff in conjunction with the danger			1
" " family " co-creator @entity151 explained that they wanted their show to have no costumes ( at first ) , either : " i think the goal is , what if it happened to us ? " he said			2
" there 's so many things that in the real version of a person getting his abilities , the costume seems like something that would be in the future			0
the costumes , if they ever did show up , would come much later			0
give the characters a good origin @entity171 , who created the @entity44 series " heroes , " certainly agrees about making the characters relatable			1
" i was mainly interested in the idea of powers and how people wrestled with and dealt with the idea of discovery of something new , " he said			0
" to me the origin story is in many ways the most fascinating part of it			0
" viewers agreed , as the show 's first season was one of @entity44 's biggest hits at the time			1
" there was that kind of transparency between your life and characters on the show			1
our characters really did n't live heightened lives and their world did n't have that kind of gothic - y look , " he said			1
" they were very much like us			0
for me that was the important thing			0
" @entity44 has another series inspired by comic books on the horizon , and its main character also has an intriguing backstory			1
" @entity216 , " premiering early next year , is about an innocent man falsely accused of a crime , and seemingly killed while running from the authorities			0
instead he goes into hiding and takes on the guise of the @entity219 , a comic book hero whom his son idolizes			0
actor @entity224 described the show as being " in the tradition of crime drama that just takes place in this fantastic world			0
it 's based in reality , and that helps you believe in what 's going on a little more			0
do n't try to be " lost " ( or " heroes " ) @entity237 , one of the best known comic book writers in the business , was named the head of @entity242 television back in june			1
he 's quite suited for the role , having had a hand in the tv series " lost " and " heroes			1
" both shows had long story arcs that ran over an entire season , or longer			0
however , when it comes to the shows @entity237 hopes to bring to tv , he does n't plan to follow that tradition			0
" what we 've talked about is more of the model on ' @entity23			0
' it may have had an overriding arc , but it was more of the emotional arcs that we were following , " he said			0
" we want to start each show with a problem , and resolve that problem at the end of the episode			0
whatever the emotional arc is going on , that 's what you care about			0
if you do n't care about characters , you 're not gon na care about the show			1
we do n't want a show driven by the plot , we want a show driven by the character			0
never underestimate the importance of villains for many fans , @entity280 was the most intriguing character on " heroes			1
" villains came and went but @entity280 , a serial killer driven by the overwhelming desire to acquire more supernatural powers , was a constant ( and @entity289 's performance earned him the opportunity to play the iconic @entity291 in the 2009 " @entity293 " movie )			0
on " @entity23 , " each season has seen bigger and bigger villains , from @entity296 , to @entity297 , @entity298 , and this season , @entity300			0
so , for an up - and - coming series like " @entity216 , " the villains were seen as extremely important			0
" i want to create a classic ' rogues gallery ' like @entity305 or @entity13 's , " said series creator @entity303			0
in the first episode , he introduces two by the names of @entity308 and @entity309			0
however , @entity303 says he wo n't overdo it			0
" in 12 episodes , you wo n't see 12 new villains			0
you got ta roll out your villains , and make sure they 're solid before you bring them in			1
" " @entity123 " producers hinted that the family will come up against a major villain as the first season goes along as well			1
keep it simple when asked to share advice for producers of superhero programs like @entity303 , @entity136 and @entity151 , " heroes ' " @entity171 said , " my advice would be stay away from time travel			1
" ( indeed , some " heroes " fans felt that some of the overly complex aspects of the show as it went on may have played a hand in its loss of viewership over the years			1
) " having spent a couple thousand hours , probably , in the writers ' room trying to figure out the rules of time travel , i would caution anybody to stay away from that idea			1
" " you really ca n't do anything that 's wholly unique in the superpower genre , " @entity171 said			1
" every power has been thought of			0
coming up with a brand new power is not really the ultimate goal anymore			0
i 'm just fascinated to see how these new shows explore the genre			0

producers , writers say make the heroes believable
give the characters a good backstory
give the time travel *gimmick* a rest , says @entity171
