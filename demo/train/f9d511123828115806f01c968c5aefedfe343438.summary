-- police say a young man who went on a rampage at a shopping mall in @entity5 , @entity6 , was so obsessed with the april 1999 massacre at @entity8 that he dressed up in an outfit reminiscent of those shooters and took a picture of himself			1
the shooter , 19 - year - old @entity14 , uploaded the picture of himself dressed in cargo pants and boots to the social networking web site @entity19 before the incident , police said wednesday			1
the photo was taken in the dressing room of the @entity23 in @entity5 store where @entity14 would commit his crimes			2
in late january , @entity14 fatally shot @entity26 , 21 , and @entity27 , 25 , and injured a third person before turning the gun on himself			1
police declined to release the photo , saying they believe @entity14 took it to gain notoriety and they wo n't honor that desire			2
@entity37 police chief @entity36 said a message accompanying the picture read , in part ; " i had to do this			2
" a police statement said @entity14 's account has been deactivated by @entity19			2
police verified previous reports that the shooter and the victims , one of whom worked at the skateboard apparel shop , were not acquainted			2
what was made clear from the latest release of information about the case was that police believe @entity14 had studied the @entity8 shooting and seemed to be trying to mimic what occurred there			2
" @entity14 's weapon , attire , backpack containing explosives and method of suicide were all similar to those used in the @entity8 incident , said a @entity37 police statement			1
on april 20 , 1999 , two @entity69 students , @entity70 and @entity70 , killed 12 of their classmates , a teacher and then themselves			1
the school is in @entity74 , @entity75			0
@entity36 said police have learned @entity14 began using the @entity77 last year to search for information about mass shootings in malls and schools , gun laws and explosive techniques			1
he even downloaded a video game allowing players to act as one of the shooters from that day			0
juxtaposed with those searches were inquiries about mental illness and visits to sites about suicide prevention			1
@entity36 said @entity14 also sought help from his regular doctor because he said he was hearing voices			0
the doctor said he referred @entity98 to a psychiatrist , but it does n't seem he ever made an appointment			1
the doctor told police @entity14 said those voices were non-violent and did n't direct him to do anything , authorities said			0
in december 2013 , @entity14 purchased a shotgun at a shop just outside @entity108 he was there with a friend , but police said the friend had no suspicions and no knowledge of @entity14 's future plans			0
@entity14 told his friend he was buying the gun for target practice			0
police also recovered a journal which they said ultimately did not shed a lot of light on @entity14 's motives , but did give them some insight into his disturbed mind			1
in one entry , @entity14 wrote , " i ( sic ) going to * expletive * kill you all in a couple of hours i 'm anxious , i hate you all so much you are pathetic pieces of * expletive * who deserve to die			0
worthless you are all * expletive * worthless			0
i think that i may already be dead			0
" police said @entity14 fired a total of nine rounds , but came into the store with 54			0
" frankly , we 're fortunate he took his own life rather than to run down the hallway and chase victims as they were leaving , " @entity36 told reporters			0
in the end , @entity36 said , it 's clear @entity14 thought he was suffering from a mental illness but was afraid to even tell his own mother			1
@entity36 said he believes the discussion on mental health treatment must continue			1
" nobody saw this coming , " @entity36 said			0
" he was a young man that did n't garner much attention to himself			0
