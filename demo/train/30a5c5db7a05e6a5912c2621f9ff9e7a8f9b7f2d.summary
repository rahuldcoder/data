-- a 93rd minute @entity2 goal salvaged a late draw for @entity4 as they held @entity5 in their opening @entity7 match on tuesday			1
it was the least @entity4 deserved after taking the game to the @entity11 champions , even going ahead within the first minute thanks to a piece of individual brilliance			2
@entity15 international @entity14 slalomed through @entity5 's surprisingly porous defense before slotting home to give the home side an early , and unexpected , bloody nose			2
@entity5 pressed for an inevitable equalizer with @entity21 again central			2
after clipping the post a few minutes earlier , his mazy run found him enough space to stroke a ball across the penalty box that was gleefully tapped in by @entity28			0
and when @entity30 scored with a brilliant second half free kick , it looked like @entity5 would start their defense of the crown with an impressive win against one of the strongest teams in @entity11 football			0
but @entity2 's late , late header shared the points			0
elsewhere in @entity41 goals were in short supply			0
it took @entity44 72 minutes to break the deadlock against @entity47 side @entity46 in @entity48 , @entity15 defender @entity49 curling in a right foot shot from @entity51 ' lay off			2
@entity52 international @entity51 was again the provider when he unselfishly squared the ball to compatriot @entity55 with the match going into injury time , sealing a 2 - 0 victory			1
@entity59 had their hopes of an early away victory against @entity62 in @entity63 dashed late on when an incredible @entity65 volley cancelled out @entity67 's first half strike			1
the result of the night , however , came from @entity69 where @entity70 came from a goal down against @entity73 champions @entity72 with under 20 minutes left to win 2 - 1 in @entity74 @entity76 's second half strike looked to have sealed victory for @entity72 , but two goals in three minutes from @entity70 's @entity15 duo of @entity80 and @entity81 turned the tie on its head			1
elsewhere in @entity85 got their campaign off to a winning start by beating nine - man @entity88 2 - 1 in @entity90			1
striker @entity91 made it a good night for @entity15 playing in @entity41 after scoring the winning goal in the second half			0
@entity96 side @entity95 fought a creditable 0 - 0 draw against @entity52 's @entity98 in @entity48 , whilst @entity100 debutantes @entity101 also won their first ever @entity103 point in @entity104 with a 1 - 1 home draw against @entity106 from @entity107			1
in @entity63 @entity109 ' @entity108 got their @entity103 challenge off to the best possible start against @entity113 side @entity112			0
@entity115 midfielder @entity114 ' scored the only goal of a game that saw @entity112 reduced to ten men after substitute @entity119 was shown a straight red card for a reckless challenge .			0
