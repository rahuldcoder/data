@entity0 -- @entity2 says he 's leaning toward running for a third two - year term as chairman of the @entity5 so that he can helm what needs to be an " about perfect " campaign to defeat @entity8 in a presidential election			1
@entity2 told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the @entity12 on friday that he 'd remain focused on the " mechanics " of politics -- including improving @entity16 ' collection of data targeting individual voters and its field operation in presidential battleground states			1
his comments came with an eye on 2016 , when republicans fear the favorable electorate they found in this year 's midterm elections will be drowned out by a much larger turnout among left - leaning voters			0
@entity2 pointed to wins this year in @entity31 races in @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 -- three states that president @entity36 carried at least once -- as demonstrating that the @entity16 can win " in a purple state in a good environment with a good candidate , " and offering hope ahead of 2016			1
but , he said , @entity16 will have to run a flawless national campaign -- including increasing outreach to @entity45 , @entity44 and black communities and targeting people who often do n't vote			0
" i think we 've got to be about perfect as a national party to win , " he said			0
" democrats can be good and win , and we 've got to be great			0
" he said the @entity5 wo n't pull its staff out of presidential battleground states , and said " we need to have a full - blown field operation in place " by march 2015 in the key states of @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
that , he said , is a tall task when staffers are tired and donors are tapped out			0
but , @entity2 said , the party 's huge wins in 2014 will help wipe out the bitter taste that was left in many @entity16 donors ' mouths after the 2012 election			1
" our investors at the @entity5 are excited that the mechanics work , and they can see that a good , competent program on the ground is something they 'll invest in immediately in 2015 , " he said			2
he underscored the party 's plans to limit the number of primary debates and curtail its grueling nominating schedule , and said he 'll also be more willing than he was in 2012 to criticize candidates who spend too much time " slicing each other apart			0
" " there 's going to be a high level of disdain , " @entity2 said , " for candidates who spend their time trying to destroy other @entity16			2

@entity2 says he 'll likely seek a third term as @entity5 chairman
he says the @entity16 will need to be " about perfect " in order to win the @entity90 in 2016
@entity2 says the @entity16 will keep their field offices already in place in presidential battleground states
