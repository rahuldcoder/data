look up at our nearest neighbor , the moon , and you 'll see stark evidence of the dangerous neighborhood we live in			2
@entity6 was sculpted by large - scale events , including many meteor and asteroid impacts			1
in 1994 , the comet @entity12 9 dove into @entity13			2
the impact caused a brilliant flash , visible in @entity18 telescopes , and left an ugly dark scar on @entity13 's cold , gaseous surface			1
with the recent fly - by of a 1,000 - foot - wide asteroid labeled 99942 @entity23 , one of a class of space rocks referred to as " near - @entity18 objects " or " earth - grazers , " scientists have revised their worst estimates of its chances of striking @entity18			1
current thinking is : we 're safe			2
for the next couple of decades			0
but this does not mean the danger is over			0
named after the evil @entity38 serpent god @entity23 , lord of chaos and darkness -- and recently dubbed the " doomsday asteroid " -- it flies past @entity18 every seven years			1
this year , its 1,000 - foot bulk approached to within 9 million miles			0
in 2029 , it will swoop in close enough to put some of our orbiting satellites in peril -- 20,000 miles			2
in that year , no doubt @entity23 will arouse even more attention , because it will be visible in the daytime sky			1
in 2036 , it will probably pass by at a reassuring 14 million miles			0
yet there 's always a possibility we do n't have these measurements exactly right			0
something could happen at any point in @entity23 ' orbit to modify its course , just a smidgen			1
a tiny collision with another object , way out beyond @entity63 ? what could change between now and 2029 , or during any orbit thereafter ? apophis masses at more than 20 million tons			1
if it hit @entity18 , the impact would unleash a blast the equivalent of over a billion tons of @entity70			1
that 's not an extinction event , but it could easily cause billions of deaths and months , if not years , of climate disruption			2
the potential risk is huge			0
and @entity23 is far from alone			1
life in our solar system has always been dangerous			0
as kids we learn about the @entity81 in @entity82 , a relatively recent formation -- 50,000 years old -- caused by a rock weighing several times more an aircraft carrier			2
that impact released the equivalent of 20 megatons of @entity70 and left a crater 4,000 feet wide			1
both @entity63 and @entity18 were long ago hit by planet - sized objects , one spinning off our @entity92 , the other shaping two distinctly different hemispheres on @entity63			1
to this day , a steady rain of meteors falls on @entity18 -- some of them left - over pebbles and dust from worn - out comets , others from the " asteroid belt , " still others from big strikes on the @entity92 and @entity63			1
since oceans cover two - thirds of the @entity18 's surface , it 's more likely debris will hit water than land			1
scientists believe it was the blast of a 6 - mile - wide asteroid off the coast of @entity114 some 64 million years ago that changed @entity18 's weather for years and hastened the departure of the dinosaurs			1
ocean hits are worse than land hits , not just because of immense tidal waves , but because of the vast quantities of super-heated water vapor and dust that spread from the impact to shroud the entire @entity18			1
in march 1966 , @entity125 published his ground - breaking article , " @entity129 , " in the periodical @entity128			0
@entity130 surveyed the available material on meteor and asteroid strikes , then published his own calculations and analysis of what such strikes could do , and have done , to the @entity18 , with cinematically vivid prose and equally terrifying physics			1
he was the first to put it all together and publish in a respected and widely available forum			0
although geology was still reluctant to admit to any form of " catastrophism , " eschewing biblical explanations , many read and pondered ... seriously			0
in the decades since @entity130 's article , writers , scientists , and engineers have proposed various ways to avert such disasters			0
some have suggested we strap rocket motors to a threatening rock and nudge it away			0
a steady pulse of projectile " paintballs " could also do the trick			0
others have suggested we use nuclear weapons to " kick " an asteroid from its orbit , or even to shatter it into smaller debris -- a rather dim idea that misleads us into believing a single bullet is worse than the blast from a shotgun			2
our atmosphere provides little protection against meteors larger than a truck			2
moreover , many asteroids are chunky masses of rock and dust loosely held together by very little gravity , like loosely packed peanut clusters			0
attempting to attach a rocket to one of these might merely dislodge a few " peanuts , " leaving the rest to do the dirty work			0
wrap one of these peanut clusters in a giant steel net , then drag it off its deadly course ? intriguing , but for now -- like deploying tractor beams from the starship enterprise -- it 's just so much super-science .			0

@entity196 : @entity23 flew by this month and was much larger than expected
named after an evil @entity38 serpent god , @entity23 *swings* by every seven years
bear : we can never be 100 *%* sure how close it will come or if events might change its course
if @entity23 hit @entity18 , he says , the blast would be the equivalent of over a billion tons of @entity70
