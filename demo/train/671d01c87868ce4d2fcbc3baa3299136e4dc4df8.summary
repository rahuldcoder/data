@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's seventh arrest for @entity5 was as sensational as it gets			1
police chased him in his @entity7 at more than 90 mph in downtown @entity0 , @entity1			1
a passenger , whom @entity4 had just met at a bar , begged to leave the car , and his wish was granted while the car slowed			1
@entity4 crashed his sports car , a 2000 model worth $ 70,000 , into a house and two cars			1
the tall , tan businessman was finally arrested behind the wheel in a church parking lot with police drawing their guns on him just before midnight december 29			2
cops noted his watery , bloodshot eyes and smelled alcohol on his breath			0
now there 's a local uproar over how @entity4 , 42 , avoided hard jail time -- despite facing his seventh drunk - driving offense and with his blood alcohol measuring 0.16 , twice @entity1 's threshold for @entity5			1
@entity4 was given 364 days of work - release from jail because , a judge ruled , jailing him would harm his small business , his employees and the community			1
under work - release , he spends his days as a free man at his telecommunications business , but he spends his weeknights and weekends in jail , his attorney said			1
but critics such as @entity45 are outraged			0
" it seems like @entity4 and other people that are wealthy are playing by a different set of rules , " @entity45 said			1
" i think it 's also that he 's a business owner in this town and that society sees @entity4 more important than anyone else			1
" i think @entity4 , when he got his fourth @entity5 charge or fifth @entity5 charge , should have faced stiffer penalties then , " @entity45 added			1
" in a way , it 's almost society has said that ' if you 're rich , it 's ok to do this			2
i 'm sure you 'll turn it around ' -- as if those who are wealthy have more of an ability to change than those that are poor			2
" in february , a judge even gave @entity4 permission to travel to @entity73 and attend the @entity74 while his case was being adjudicated , said @entity76 , the attorney for @entity4			1
the defense @entity4 declined to comment , but @entity76 said his client " did not receive special treatment			1
" the size of @entity4 's wealth was n't immediately available , but his house is a 3 - acre gated property , with a boat on a trailer on the driveway to a separate three - car garage			1
" it is a benefit to society in the bigger picture , even though i can understand the outrage , but there 's also a big cost to society in terms of not just the cost of incarceration , " @entity76 said			2
" there 's definitely a benefit to society allowing people even such as mr. @entity4 to do work release when they 're serving a jail sentence			1
" it gives them means to support themselves , their families , and in mr. @entity4 's case , because he 's an employer , employees keep their jobs , " the attorney added			1
@entity4 received the maximum allowed by law for misdemeanor @entity5 , @entity76 said			1
some argue that a seventh @entity5 should have made @entity4 eligible for a felony -- and a tougher maximum sentence			1
but @entity1 state law does n't allow for such a felony because @entity4 did n't accumulate four duis in the past 10 years , @entity76 said			1
the prior misdemeanor @entity5 accusations occurred in 1993 , 1994 , 1999 , 2004 , 2006 and 2011 , and two of them -- in 1999 and 2004 -- were reduced to lesser misdemeanors , according to court papers			1
" i know a lot of people believe it should have been at felony level , " @entity76 said			0
" under @entity1 law , the work - release program is still considered a jail program because you do spend your evenings and weekends in the jail , and so you only get out to work			1
and so based on that , he did in fact get the maximum sentence allowed by law			2
" the prosecutor @entity140 prosecuting attorney @entity139 disputed accusations that @entity4 got a lenient sentence because he 's wealthy			1
" there was no favoritism allowed here , " the prosecutor said			0
" the gut reaction is to want to punish him more than other offenders because of the fact that he had money , and we 're not going to do that , either			0
we 're going to treat him the same as we would treat any other offender			0
" i think if you can keep somebody working while they 're in custody -- so they 're working while they 're out of custody -- substantially reduces the likelihood that they would re-offend , particularly when you 're talking about someone who is an alcoholic or a drug addict , " @entity139 said			0
" i think you got to set emotion aside and really think about what is the best long term solution for the community			2
" the defense attorney and the prosecutor acknowledged how some people may express frustration over what protesters contend is an overly lenient justice system toward @entity4			1
both attorneys cited the way that the state law is written for such cases as @entity4 's : it does n't allow for harsher sentences			1
but @entity4 is remorseful , @entity76 said			2
" he acknowledges and understands the gravity of the situation and how serious it is , " @entity76 said			0
" every indication to me is that he 's given is that he wants treatment and will continue to do treatment and do everything to conquer that demon " of alcoholism , he said			0
the passenger @entity192 , 28 , of @entity0 met @entity4 at a local tavern , where @entity4 was flashing $ 100 bills and buying drinks for people			2
@entity192 was treated to a @entity197 , a cinnamon whiskey			0
" i had known him less than an hour , and he said , ' hey , do you want to ride with me ? ' and i said yeah , " @entity192 said			0
" i was just like , wow , yeah , it 's a @entity7			1
i had never been in a @entity7 before			2
" they were headed to another saloon			0
" as we leave the parking lot , he 's already speeding , and there 's a police officer right there , and he tries to pull us over , " @entity192 said			2
" we go maybe a half a block , and i 'm noticing something is wrong			0
and i 'm like , hey , can we please pull over ? the cops are here ... and he immediately blurts he ca n't			0
" first thing that comes out of my mind , ' i have a son ; i have a 2 - year - old son			0
please let me out ! ' " @entity192 recounted			0
he thought he was going to die			0
he could n't find the interior handle to open the door			0
" i figured , hey , i 'm going to die here tonight			0
i 'm going to die in this car			0
this is a small car ; i 'm a big guy ; i 'm going to die , " @entity192 said			0
@entity192 grabbed the wheel while @entity4 was driving			2
then @entity192 jumped out of the @entity7			2
@entity192 says he 's still traumatized by the experience : he sees a psychologist weekly and a chiropractor three times a week			0
when he can get sleep , he dreams of the ride all over again , he said			0
he ca n't stand or sit for a long period of time			0
@entity4 has never apologized to him , and @entity192 feels the court let @entity4 off easy			2
" it 's just sad to feel forgotten by the justice system , " @entity192 said			0
" they 're not worried about the people			0
" man who confessed to drunken driving in viral video gets more than 6 years @entity2 's @entity240 and @entity241 reported from @entity1 .			1

@entity243 's seventh @entity5 is a misdemeanor under @entity1 state law
he drove his @entity7 above 90 mph *fleeing* police , crashing into two cars and a house
judge gives @entity4 work - release because jailing him would hurt his employees
