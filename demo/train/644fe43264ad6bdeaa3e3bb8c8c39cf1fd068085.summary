@entity0 , @entity1 -- the 33 miners trapped inside a @entity1 mine since august 5 have been told for the first time that they could be stuck underground for as long as four months , the head of the rescue operation said friday			1
but @entity8 , the mines manager for the state mining company , and @entity1 government representative @entity11 also said they are working on a " @entity13 , " which could help speed up the rescue process			1
" last night , a third probe reached where the miners are and that probe , or the bore hole made by that probe , could form the basis of our plan b , " said @entity8 , declining to offer specifics			1
officials expect drilling on a rescue shaft , a process that workers have said could take four months to complete , to begin this weekend			1
still , even under the best - case scenario , the trapped miners will be underground for quite some time -- posing a host of practical and psychological problems			1
to help solve them , @entity1 officials are looking in unlikely places			2
an official at @entity37 , the @entity38 space agency , said on friday the organization has been asked by @entity1 to help provide nutritional and behavioral health support to the miners			1
a four - person team , including two physicians and a psychologist , are planning to go to @entity1 next week , said @entity45 , @entity37 's lead on the @entity1 effort			1

" it 's an opportunity to us to bring the space - flight experience back down to the ground , " said @entity45			1
the workers , trapped 2,300 feet below the surface , have been trying to keep their spirits -- and the spirits of their loved ones -- from flagging			1
they sent a video message to their families thursday in which they expressed thanks for the efforts under way to free them and displayed occasional flashes of humor and patriotism			2
" we know what you 've all been doing for us , " said one man			0
" you have n't left us alone			0
we want to send applause to you			0
" at that , the men broke into applause			0
throughout the 25 - minute , high - definition video , one miner guided the hand - held camera ahead of him , its path illuminated by the light on his mining helmet			1
the video views were grainy and sometimes out of focus			2
the video showed the 50 - square - meter ( about 540 - square - foot ) living space occupied by the men since they were trapped by the collapse of a mine shaft			1
some appeared heavily bearded , all of them were stripped to the waist			0
a thermometer showed 29.5 degrees @entity99 , ( about 85 degrees @entity100 ) , a little cooler than officials had estimated			0
some of the men were standing , others were lying down			0
" oh , you 're sleeping on a box - spring bed , " joked one man to another , who is sprawled out on a pile of rocks			2
on a crate sat a set of dominoes ; on a wall were two first - aid boxes			2
one miner said to his family : " be calm			0
we 're going to get out of here			0
and we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your efforts			0
" at that , the other miners broke into applause again			2
the tenor of most of the comments was calm , though one man 's emotion cut through			0
" thank you to everybody , " he said			0
" i send you a big hug in the name of our lord			0
" as he spoke , his voice cracked			0
out of the view of the camera , as one miner finished his message , another could be heard saying , " get us out of here soon			0
" family members who saw the video in a private screening said their loved ones appeared thin , but healthy and in good spirits			1
several said many of the relatives cried as they watched and listened			0
doctors have given the miners advice about how to keep their limited living space clean : portions of a 1 - meter - high ( 3.3 feet ) , 40 - meter - long ( about 130 feet ) shaft are being used as a latrine			1
it is connected to the main cabin , which is being used for sleeping , washing and praying			0
the men 's sole lifeline to the outside world is a tube approximately 8 centimeters ( 3.2 inches ) in diameter , through which food , water , clothing , video and radio equipment and whatever else is needed are stuffed			2
health minister @entity169 told reporters thursday that , on average , each man has lost 22 pounds ( 10 kilograms ) since they became trapped three weeks ago , and dehydration remains a threat			1
but a survey of the men indicates that at least nine miners are still too overweight to fit through the proposed rescue shaft , he said			1
three or four of the miners are showing signs of anxiety and depression , @entity169 added .			2
