-- the @entity1 came from a goal down to beat 10 - man @entity4 2 - 1 in their @entity6 quarterfinal clash in @entity7 on friday			1
an early goal from @entity9 had put @entity4 in command , but in the second half the @entity11 drew level when @entity15 's cross was deflected into his own net by @entity17			1
@entity18 's @entity15 then headed his team ahead in the 68th minute after @entity21 's corner had been cleverly flicked on by @entity22			1
a miserable afternoon for @entity17 was completed when he was sent off for stamping on @entity21			2
the @entity11 will play either @entity23 or @entity24 in the semifinals , but for @entity4 and coach @entity26 it is a bitter defeat			2
" we are all responsible for this situation but i have the greatest responsibility , " he told @entity29			0
the inspirational @entity15 was surprised to score the winner with a rare headed goal			0
" this was my first header here , i do n't think it will happen again , but it was great , " he told @entity29			0
" the ball slipped on my bald head and went into the net , a great feeling			0
" the 26 - year - old added : " if you can eliminate @entity4 , one of the best teams in this championship the first feeling is relief , we always believed in it			0
" a @entity11 victory had looked unlikely as the five - time @entity6 champions took charge from the start			1
@entity17 found @entity9 with a precise pass through a static @entity11 defense and he made no mistake as he swept his shot past @entity57 in the 10th minute			1
further chances fell to the @entity59 as @entity60 set up defender @entity61 who blazed his volley over			0
the best move of the match involving @entity9 and @entity66 saw @entity67 draw a brilliant save from @entity57 , while right back @entity68 shot into the side netting on the run as half - time approached			0
there seemed no way back for the @entity11 , but a 53rd minute aberration from @entity4 keeper @entity75 turned the tide of the match			1
he totally missed @entity15 's left - footed cross from the right and the unfortunate @entity17 saw it brush his body before finding its way into the net			2
more poor defending allowed @entity15 to give the @entity11 the lead and when @entity17 was deservedly shown red it was the end of the line for the @entity90 champions			1
only a strong run and shot by @entity67 which was deflected away offered them much hope and they might have fallen further behind to @entity11 counter attacks .			0

the @entity1 beat @entity4 2 - 1 in @entity6 quarterfinal in @entity7
@entity9 put @entity4 ahead but an own goal by @entity17 saw the @entity11 level
@entity15 scores winner for the @entity11 in 68th minute
@entity17 sent off soon afterwards for *fouling* @entity21
