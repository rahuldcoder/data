his lawyers have argued that @entity5 is mentally retarded			1
last minute stay of execution granted in february " today , the @entity21 found that more time is needed to explore mr. @entity5 's complaint , which raises serious concerns about the extreme secrecy surrounding the execution process in @entity3 , and the new @entity27 , which took effect one day before @entity3 issued a death warrant for mr. @entity5 , " @entity19 , @entity5 's attorney said in a statement			2
monday is not the first time @entity5 's execution has been halted			1

a new execution date is expected to be set for the same day , he said			0
" ultimately , we are hopeful that the @entity39 will hear mr. @entity5 's pending @entity40 , and will have the opportunity to consider the important new evidence in this case , that there is unanimous consensus among all the doctors who have examined mr. @entity5 , including three who previously testified for the state , that he is a person with mental retardation , and thus ineligible for the death penalty , " said @entity19			1
@entity5 's lawyers say his low @entity52 means he should be spared under a 2002 decision that barred the execution of the mentally disabled			1
