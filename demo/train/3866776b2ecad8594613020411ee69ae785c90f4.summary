@entity0 -- @entity3 was one of the most " vicious , violent and calculating criminals to ever walk the streets of @entity0 , " prosecuting attorney @entity2 told the jury monday as closing arguments began after 35 days of testimony in @entity3 's trial			1
@entity3 is accused of 19 killings and 13 counts of extortion and money laundering during a 20 - year " reign of terror " that defined @entity0 from the early ' 70s through 1995 , when @entity3 fled @entity0			1
the prosecution took close to three and a half hours for its closing			2
the defense took over two and a half hours to make its case , then the prosecution had the final word in a rebuttal			1
the jury will begin deliberating the fate of the alleged crime boss tuesday			0
defense attorney @entity27 summed up his case by questioning the credibility of prosecution witnesses , some of whom came to court with extensive criminal resumes and who had worked out deals with the government in exchange for testifying against @entity3			1
" if you can not say in your deliberation that i personally can believe ( prosecution witnesses ) beyond a reasonable doubt , then the government can not prove its case about the alleged murders , " @entity27 told the jury			2
" the government is buying the testimony of these witnesses			0
the currency used here ( is ) how much freedom someone is going to get			0
what the government can pay the individual is the individual 's freedom , " @entity27 continued			2
earlier , prosecutor @entity2 said @entity3 and his partner " plotted , they schemed , they robbed they murdered together , they were also informants together			2
" prosecutors contend @entity3 was an @entity62 informant who used protection from rogue agents as he continued his life of crime			1
defense attorneys have argued @entity3 was not an informant , and that @entity62 bungling was key in the case			1
" if there is one thing you heard during this trial , it 's how secretive that relationship is , " @entity2 said to the jury monday			2
" the last thing a criminal wants ... is for people to know he 's an informant			0
" but he also said that it " does n't matter whether or not @entity3 is an @entity62 informant when he put the gun to the head of @entity82 and pulled the trigger			1
" @entity85 died after being shot in the head in 1983			0
" it 's not about whether or not the @entity62 in @entity0 was a mess , " he said			1
" ... it 's about whether or not the defendant is guilty of crimes charged in the indictment			0
" he added , " when he puts a gun in the stomach of @entity100 ( @entity99 ) @entity98 and tells him you own me $ 400,000 , it does n't matter if he is an informant or not , it does n't matter whether or not the @entity62 is leaking information to him			2
" the defense rested its case friday with no rebuttal from the government			2
during their weeklong defense , @entity3 's lawyers seemed to have three goals : one : try to cast doubt on who killed two of the 19 victims , both of them women			1
two : shift the blame onto the @entity62 , specifically agents who either did nothing or did too little to prevent several killings			1
three : convince the jury that @entity3 was not an @entity62 informant , a notion prosecutors called " ludicrous " in light of his @entity62 informant card and a 700 - page file loaded with " tips " on rival gang members			1
in closing arguments , defense attorney @entity129 told jurors why he thinks the government has made @entity3 's informant status the crux of its case			1
" think about why it 's so important , if it 's not an issue , why do they keep bringing it up , " @entity129 posed to jurors @entity129 explained that other than to " embarrass " his client , the government was boasting @entity3 's informant status to cover up years of corruption			1
" if he 's not an informant , think of the liability , " he said , recounting instance after instance where government officials as high as strike - force attorneys in the @entity146 protected @entity3 throughout his criminal career			1
@entity150 defends plea deals defense attorneys also attacked the credibility of gangsters who became star witnesses for the prosecution , testifying under immunity after they learned @entity3 was an informant for the @entity62 for nearly two decades			1
@entity2 on monday defended the government 's unsavory plea deals with those gangsters , three of whom together implicated @entity3 in the 19 murders and various acts of extortion			1
" the government did n't choose them , @entity3 chose them , " @entity2 said			1
" the only thing worse than making a deal with ( former hit man ) @entity170 would have been not making a deal with @entity170			0
" @entity2 said the government " held its nose and made the deal			0
" it took prosecutors 90 minutes to detail the 19 murders @entity3 is accused of , showing photos of each of the victims and the crime scenes			1
@entity3 is not charged with delivering the fatal blow in all of the murders , but is charged with participating as part of a racketeering conspiracy			2
@entity2 called @entity3 " the leader of a very wide - ranging , broad organization , " who is culpable for his co-conspirator 's crimes			1
but @entity2 made clear @entity3 was the alleged triggerman in some cases , recalling testimony from @entity3 's partner , @entity195 " @entity194 , about the murder of @entity197 , whose remains were exhumed from a shallow makeshift grave in 2000			1
@entity200 had begun cooperating with the government on the shipment of weapons to the @entity204 and 36 tons of marijuana imported into @entity206			0
" it 's @entity82 all over again , held at gunpoint , chained to the kitchen chair , interrogated , " @entity2 said			0
@entity210 said he was holding @entity200 's body while @entity3 was trying to strangle him with a rope , but the rope was too thick			1
after that did n't work , @entity200 practically begged for a bullet after @entity3 asked him " would you like one in the head , " according to @entity210			2
@entity2 got choked up at some points , trying to make @entity3 appear utterly heartless			1
in talking about the murder of @entity221 , @entity2 recalls that @entity3 's former cohorts testified that whenever they passed the @entity223 , where @entity221 's remains were exhumed in 2000 , @entity3 said , " ' drink up , @entity225			2
' that 's the level of humanity that this defendant is operating at			0
... and every time he goes by there its ' drink up , @entity225			0
' " victim 's mother warned @entity62 about an impending murder @entity3 was a fugitive for more than 16 years , after a crooked @entity62 agent told him in december 1994 he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges			1
the @entity62 track him down and arrested him 2011 in @entity237 , @entity238 , where he had been living with his girlfriend under an alias			2
during the trial , jurors heard dramatic testimony from convicted gangsters , bookies , extortion victims , a disgraced @entity62 supervisor , ex-drug - dealers , retired @entity62 agents and relatives of people @entity3 is accused of killing			1
@entity170 testified for both sides , making a total of 72 witnesses over 35 days			0
@entity3 never took the stand despite repeated hints from his lawyers throughout trial he would testify			2
in fact , @entity3 seemed to want to testify			0
questioned by judge @entity263 , @entity3 called his decision a " choice made involuntarily			0
" he claimed he had been given immunity for his crimes by the former head of @entity270 's @entity269 , @entity268 , now deceased			0
" the evidence is overwhelming , " @entity2 said as he concluded his closing argument			0
he called @entity3 " the leader of one of the most ruthless criminal organizations ever in @entity0 , " one that " wreaked havoc on this city for decades			1
" " in his capacity as the leader , he is legally responsible for it all , as either a principle an aider and abettor or conspirator			0
" ' @entity3 : i did n't get a fair trial ' @entity3 , who lost his temper several times during the trial , appeared angry , shaking his finger at the judge and claiming he was " choked off from making an adequate defense			1
" " i did n't get a fair trial			0
do what ya 's want with me , " @entity3 said			2
families of the victims have been in court every day of the trial			0
the wife of one of the victims shouted " you 're a coward ! " @entity305 's husband , a truck driver , was killed in the crossfire of a slaying @entity3 allegedly committed			2
she later explained @entity3 had a chance to take the stand and tell the truth			0
@entity210 testified as one of the government 's star witnesses , and he said that he saw @entity3 strangle the two women			1
the defense team , however , presented evidence that @entity210 had the greater motive to kill the women -- his girlfriend and his stepdaughter			0
@entity3 's attorneys release photos designed to show his softer side the girlfriend , @entity323 , was about to leave him for another man			2
the defense recalled @entity170 , who testified that @entity210 admitted he " accidentally strangled " the 26 - year - old woman			1
@entity210 acknowledged he lured @entity327 to a home but says @entity3 strangled her because she was talking too much and had become a liability			0
@entity2 recalled testimony that @entity3 always needed to take a nap after strangling or shooting his victims to death			0
in his closing argument , prosecutor @entity2 told the jurors they " do n't have to decide who strangled @entity337			0
" " he does n't need to be the one that strangled her to be criminally liable , " he said			0
" if he is a co-conspirator or he aids and abets , he is just as liable as he is if he puts his hands around her neck and strangles the life out of her			0
" a number of retired @entity62 agents and supervisors also took the stand , many testifying that they believed @entity3 should have been shut down as an informant because he was n't providing any useful information			1
the agents said they never pressed the issue because apparently @entity62 headquarters felt @entity3 was useful in taking down the @entity357			1
there are 18 jurors , 12 with six alternates			0
eleven are men and seven are women			0
man arrested in death of alleged @entity3 extortion victim			0

new : both sides make closing arguments in the trial of @entity3
new : defense : " all our government cared about -- get the mafia at all costs "
new : prosecution : " it 's not about whether or not the @entity62 in @entity0 was a mess "
