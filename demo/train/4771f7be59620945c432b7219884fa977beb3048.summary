@entity0 -- @entity3 's new first lady is poised to impress -- and burnish @entity3 's image overseas			1
@entity5 , wife of @entity3 's new president @entity6 , made her debut as @entity3 's first lady this week accompanying @entity6 in his first overseas trip as @entity3 's new state president			1
wearing a belted overcoat , accented by a stand - up collar and a light - blue scarf , she stood next to @entity6 when they arrived in @entity15 , the first stop of @entity6 's three - nation trip			1
smiling radiantly , she shook hands with the @entity20 hosts , a step or two behind her husband			0
" we 've always looked forward to having an elegant first lady that 's presentable to the outside world , " a @entity3 official told me			1
" now we have one			0
" many @entity3 are similarly enthused			1
: " the @entity31 has @entity32 ( @entity33 ) , we have @entity5 , " wrote micro-blogger @ mlxftmilixiaofantuan			2
@entity5 , 51 , hardly needs help when it comes to public relations			2
she is a popular soprano , widely known in @entity3 for her soaring , glass - breaking voice and patriotic folk songs			1
her top hits include " people from @entity41 " and " on the @entity42			0
" will she be as good a first lady as she is a soprano ? " of course , " the @entity3 official replied			1
" she looks elegant , she is a successful professional and she comes from a modest background			0
" @entity5 was born to a family of artists in @entity47			2
her mother was a member of a local art troupe ; her father was a curator of local museum			0
in a tv talk - show interview a few years ago , @entity5 recalled the time when as a child she first saw a camera brought home by her father , who refused to take her picture because the camera was " state - owned , " not a family property			1
later , her uncle secretly took her picture that became her only childhood portrait			0
at age 14 , @entity5 enrolled at a local university of art and design			2
four years later , she joined the arts troupe of the @entity67 as a soprano			0
she holds a master 's degree in traditional ethnic music and now serves as the dean of the @entity73 of the @entity67			0
she holds the rank of a major general			0
@entity5 became a superstar in 1983 , when she sang in the first @entity78 's tv extravaganza , broadcast nationwide by state - owned @entity79 ( @entity79 )			1
the gala show was big hit and has since become the most watched and lucratively sponsored tv show in @entity3 , comparable to the annual @entity83 in the @entity31			2
@entity5 had performed in the annual tv gala show almost every year until 2007 , when @entity6 was promoted into the top - tier of the @entity86 , making him the presumptive paramount leader of @entity3			1
@entity5 quietly faded from public view			2
she has taken up charity - related positions with limited exposure			0
in those roles , political analysts say , @entity5 has helped soften @entity6 's public image			1
she became an ambassador for tobacco control in 2009			0
last year , she was appointed as the ambassador for the fight against tuberculosis and @entity99 for the @entity100 , an initiative aided by the @entity102			0
@entity3 analysts think @entity5 can similarly help burnish @entity3 's image overseas by projecting a softer touch			1
" i believe @entity5 has the prerequisites and the ability to contribute to @entity3 's diplomacy , " said @entity106 , a former ambassador to @entity20			1
still , the idea of a high - profile @entity3 first lady conjures the ghost of @entity113 , chairman @entity114 's fourth wife			1
a film starlet who later rose to the pinnacle of political power during the @entity118 , @entity113 was often depicted as an @entity119 who rode on the coattails of her omnipotent husband			0
before she was arrested and jailed in the late 1970s , @entity113 was the high - profile cultural czar during the last years of chairman @entity114 's rule			2
she sat in the elite @entity86 politburo and served as the final arbiter of political correctness in @entity3 's art and culture			1
i had never met @entity113 , but i do remember seeing her inside @entity0 's @entity130 one night in november 1971 , when we watched the " @entity132 , " a revolution - themed ballet she had co-produced			0
a few minutes before the show started , the theater lights dimmed and a group of @entity138 took the front seats			0
she was one of them , it turned out			0
all through the show , i saw her giving show - related instructions to the officials beside her			0
in contrast to @entity113 , @entity3 's @entity146 in the 1980s and 90 's kept a low public profile			1
@entity149 's wife , @entity150 , stayed in the background even when she accompanied @entity149 during his travels in and outside @entity3			1
@entity153 rarely tagged along @entity3 president @entity154 , in part because of her frail health			2
@entity157 , wife of former president @entity158 , rarely appeared â € ” and almost never spoke â € ” in public , even inside @entity3			1
many @entity3 expect @entity5 to break the old mold			1
" her human touch will get @entity6 closer to the people , " wrote microblogger @ @entity161			0
" compared to former first ladies in @entity3 , she will definitely get more attention			0
" @entity166 , a sociologist at the @entity167 said the @entity86 would be wise to use @entity5 as a " soft weapon " at home and abroad			0
" if people see that @entity6 has such a beautiful wife , it would make the ( communist ) party seem more human and less robotic , " she told the @entity170			2
still , @entity5 's fans have one slight worry			2
" our only concern is , she might unintentionally upstage our no. 1 leader , " said one			1
