-- the death of a passenger last week aboard an @entity5 flight underscores the importance of taking precautions before flying , a travel health industry representative said monday			1
an @entity5 passenger complaining that she was having trouble breathing died on a flight last week			1
@entity11 , a marketing representative for @entity12 , said its physicians last year advised 74 airlines on how to handle more than 17,000 in - flight medical events			1
flight attendants with sick passengers call @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity21 , a level - one trauma center where emergency room physicians and a service able to translate 140 languages are on call to answer questions from any of 2 million airline passengers flying at any given time , she said			1
" very rarely " does the call result in a diversion , a decision made not by the doctor but by the pilot who must consider a number of variables beyond the passenger 's health , she said			1
the pilot must weigh weather conditions , remaining fuel and proximity to an airport			0
as of 1 p.m. ( 3 p.m. et ) monday , @entity43 had fielded 110 calls , " which is a very busy day for us , " she said			0
on average , the company gets about 50 in - flight calls from commercial airliners for an entire day , and an additional 25 or 30 calls related to events that occur at airport gates or aboard yachts and commercial ships , she said			1
airlines contracting with @entity55 include @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			2
@entity59 has its own in - house medical team			1
@entity61 said @entity55 's doctors documented 97 onboard deaths in 2007 , down from 110 in 2006			2
the top categories of in - flight illness are fainting , gastrointestinal problems , respiratory issues such as shortness of breath , heart problems ranging from arrhythmias to arrest and orthopedic problems , such as broken bones , @entity61 said			1
by law , @entity59 - based commercial airlines must carry automatic external defibrillators , oxygen and medical kits			1
some airlines choose to carry extra , non-mandated medications			2
if a passenger already has breathing problems , airplane travel will only worsen the condition because cabins are typically pressurized at 8,000 feet , said @entity61			2
her advice to anyone not feeling 100 percent : " do not travel			2
" and anyone with a medical condition who travels should pack any critical medications in a carry - on bag , she said			1
though flight attendants are trained to handle on - board emergencies , " they are not medically trained , " she said			1
" to think that they are going to be able to assist your every need , that 's quite a high expectation			0
" hydration and moderation are key , and passengers should carry water and a snack , she said			2
vacationers often return home from tropical locales sunburned and , in some cases , drunk			0
" altitude amplifies the buzz , " @entity61 said			0
" you have a couple of cocktails in @entity114 , you feel it a little bit more than in @entity117			0
" @entity114 's altitude is 5,280 feet ; @entity117 's is 1,040 feet			0
flying in a fresh cast can also prove dangerous			0
" your arm could expand and it could cut off your circulation , " she said , noting that the risk is reduced with older casts , which have typically already expanded to accommodate any swelling			0
though the @entity127 began demanding that airlines carry certain medications more than 30 years ago , the list was tiny			1
during the 1990s , overseas airlines began carrying more sophisticated equipment , and pressure increased for @entity59 - based airlines to follow , said dr. @entity134 , executive director of the @entity135 , which has roughly 3,000 members including physicians , research scientists and flight nurses			1
@entity140 held hearings and then required airlines carry more robust kits and defibrillators by 2004			1
@entity5 was among the first to do so , said dr. @entity145 , who served for 10 years as the airline 's corporate medical director until 2002			1
he lauded the defibrillator as " so good it 's like 100 cardiologists in a box			0
" the machine will only work if the patient 's heart is fibrillating , a condition where the contractions become so irregular it loses its ability to pump blood efficiently			0
@entity5 buys its kits from @entity161 , which describes itself as " the nation 's leading provider of emergency medical kits			1
" each of the nine - pound , $ 250 kits includes aspirin , alcohol swabs , nitroglycerine tablets , antihistamines , iv tubing , a stethoscope , a blood - pressure gauge , a bronchodilator , syringes , gloves , saline solution , epinephrine , dextrose , a manual resuscitation bag , alcohol pads and shears			2
@entity183 comes in several forms aboard planes			2
the oxygen that flows into masks stored above individual seats is not medical oxygen and would not suffice for a passenger in an in - flight medical emergency , said @entity134			1
flight attendants have portable bottles of oxygen that they are to use for themselves in the event of a cabin decompression			1
" it could be used if there is a medical emergency on board , but that 's not its purpose , " he said			2
more oxygen is stored in the cockpit for the pilots			2
though @entity55 keeps track of its clients ' medical air incidents , @entity134 criticized the @entity127 's failure to do so			0
" there is no central repository where these things can be archived and then retrieved , " he said			0
" they do n't want to report it because it just does n't look good			0
it 's not good @entity218 , you could say			0
" he said even an anonymous registry would serve a useful purpose			0
" we 're concerned for safety on the flight , " @entity127 spokeswoman @entity222 said			0
" once someone leaves the aviation system , there is no way for us to track the outcome			0
