@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's do - or - die time in a city that has been threatened with extinction , become a symbol of small - town corruption and even been mocked in the media as " too @entity1 , even for @entity1			1
" can this worn - down , one - stoplight city prove to detractors that it can save its very soul from the venal forces that tempted it to set up a speed trap , rake in $ 1 million over the past few years and then lose track of the money ? state lawmakers are traveling tonight to the @entity19 to see for themselves whether @entity0 has been scared straight			1
if state sen. @entity20 and state rep. @entity21 do n't like what they hear , they have vowed to move forward with a bill to dissolve the city 's charter			1
it would be an extreme measure , for sure , and the first time anyone can remember the @entity1 legislature taking away a municipality 's right to govern itself			1
some , like @entity20 , say residents would hardly notice the difference			0
@entity0 's library would still lend out books			1
kids would still attend the award - winning local elementary school			0
the parks would still be open			0
and the county sheriff already has taken over patrolling the streets			0
all @entity0 's residents would be missing , @entity20 has said , is about $ 100 a year in city taxes and an unnecessary layer of government that did n't serve them very well in the first place			1
but losing their cityhood would be a devastating blow to @entity0 's collective sense of pride			1
residents think their city is worth fighting for			2
and so , for the past month , they 've been coming up with a way to save @entity0			1
a facebook page dedicated to the cause has grown to 309 followers -- big doings in a city with fewer than 500 people in it			2
the scandal that set tongues wagging writing tickets began innocently enough , said @entity0 's newly appointed city attorney , @entity65 , who 's donating his services during the crisis			1
a @entity69 station out on @entity70 301 asked for police protection , and @entity0 agreed to annex a 1,200 - foot stretch of highway			1
only later did someone come up with the idea that there was plenty of easy money to be made from catching speeders and writing tickets , just like neighboring cities @entity81 and @entity82 were doing			0
and so , @entity0 officially became a notorious speed trap			1
the way the city map was redrawn , it looked like a giant mosquito , with @entity0 sucking money directly from the highway			1
@entity89 was , the police department constantly overspent its budget , and all that ticket revenue never seemed to benefit anybody outside of @entity95			0
the police department swelled to 19 officers , including the chief			0
but @entity99 county sheriff @entity99 says many of the officers were n't trained properly , and the audit found that some of them drove uninsured vehicles			2
one officer , nicknamed " @entity107 , " dressed in tactical gear and strapped an assault rifle across his chest -- just to write tickets			0
2011 was @entity0 's bumper year for tickets -- and it also was the year rep. @entity113 was caught by @entity0 's radar guns			1
he promptly paid his ticket , but the experience reminded him of the growing stack of citizen complaints			0
in april 2013 , @entity113 asked the state auditor general to look into the city 's finances			1
@entity123 came into the mayor 's office last fall promising things were going to change			2
by then , the auditors had visited @entity95 , and people had a sense bad news was coming			0
but they still had no idea how bad			0
@entity123 barely had time to trim the hedges before he was snagged in a sheriff 's sting operation			2
according to court documents , he allegedly sold a single , 30 - milligram oxycodone pill -- a " blueberry " in street terms -- to an undercover informant for $ 20			0
the mayor was sitting in the @entity141 in february when the audit was formally released and the battle for the 89 - year - old city 's survival began			1
the audit was scathing , citing violations of @entity0 's city charter , as well as state and federal tax codes			1
the audit found plenty of other irregularities that shocked lawmakers -- including rampant nepotism , double - dipping and runaway expenses			2
there were duplicate payroll checks , a $ 132,000 credit account at the local @entity161 station and convenience store and $ 27,000 in charges run up on a credit card for items that " served no public purpose			0
" in all , the 31 violations read like a text book of municipal malfeasance			0
read the audit [ @entity171 ] @entity172 and @entity113 called for @entity0 's demise			1
" why is this even a city ? " @entity20 wondered			2
the two men met with residents last month at the @entity177 and were taken aback by the passion of their pleas to spare @entity0			1
some residents said yanking the charter would be like victimizing them twice			0
a criminal investigation is under way as @entity0 continues to fight for its life			2
the lawmakers issued a list of conditions city officials would have to meet if @entity0 is to survive as a city			1
basically , @entity0 was told it would have to elect a new city council , hire a new staff , give back the annexed strip of land along @entity70 301 and get out of the speed trap business for good			1
police chief @entity197 , city clerk @entity198 and her son , chief maintenance worker @entity199 , had already quit or been fired by then			0
after the lawmakers delivered their list of demands , city council member @entity200 , the clerk 's husband , submitted his resignation			1
the center of government was no longer what former mayor @entity209 called @entity0 's " @entity210			1
" @entity123 resigned as mayor from the jail , where he is awaiting trial on the drug charge			0
he had been suspended since his arrest			0
the city attorney also resigned			0
the remaining council members replaced @entity218 with a @entity220 preacher and brought @entity65 on board as the city attorney			0
if it survives , @entity0 will hold a special election in september			2
the four members of the city council -- including a deputy who works at the jail and who hand - delivered @entity123 's resignation letter -- have agreed to resign after the election			2
the city also will vote to amend its 1925 charter , eliminating its police force			0
there literally will be a new sheriff in town			0
@entity0 also is in the process of adopting an ordinance that would release the annexed strip of @entity70 301			2
it will hold onto the strip of land along @entity243 18 , because a water line serves a new subdivision there , but @entity0 will no longer touch @entity70 301			2
@entity65 , the city attorney , said he is optimistic that @entity0 can convince its critics that it has cleaned up its act			1
" each of these items has been addressed , or we are addressing it , " he said			0
" if we are operating within the statutes and within the law and our citizens want their city , they should be open to it			0
" @entity0 's been there a long time			1

@entity0 expects to learn fate at tonight 's meeting with @entity1 lawmakers
the city , pop. *477* , was given a month to show it can govern itself
if lawmakers are not satisfied , they vow to push bill to dissolve @entity0
state audit revealed *mismanagement* , corruption , *questionable* spending
