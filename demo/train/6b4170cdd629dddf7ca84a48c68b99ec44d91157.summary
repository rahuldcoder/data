@entity1 , @entity0 -- twenty years ago , an editor at the @entity4 told me the newspaper had changed the way it reported on @entity8			1
" now we cover it as a local story , " he said			0
why not ? there are more @entity8 living in @entity13 than in any other city in the world except for @entity16			1
from one end of the @entity19 to another , @entity17 are a natural part of the cultural landscape			1
@entity24 restaurants that are anything but exceptional do n't stay open long because the competition is too stiff			2
cities , counties , streets and subdivisions are named after @entity32 saints			0
you hear @entity34 in the air , and no longer question why that is			0
most weekends , in many cities , there is a @entity24 - style festival with food and music			0
mariachis and margaritas are always on the menu			0
supermarket clerks , bank tellers and restaurant cashiers greet me by rolling the " r 's " in my last name : @entity52			2
welcome to @entity0 , which will soon achieve a milestone of sorts			1
if state demographers are correct , in the nation 's most populous state , which is home to more than 1 in 10 @entity59 , @entity17 will soon overtake whites to become the state 's largest racial / ethnic group			1
demographers predict that sometime this spring in @entity0 , @entity17 will make up 39 % of the population while non-hispanic whites will account for 38.8 %			1
it 's a nativist nightmare			2
for those @entity0 who worry about the phenomenon that sociologists call " cultural displacement , " those feelings of being marginalized and left behind will only intensify			1
so will the sense of irony			0
a state that was once controlled by @entity8 , before @entity74 came along and ordained that @entity75 wanted white folks from @entity77 and @entity78 to have it , is now heavily populated by the runaway children of @entity8 and their offspring			1
an enormous swath of oceanfront property has been reclaimed without a formal declaration of war			0
forget what you 've heard about a reconquista : the fabled reconquering of the @entity89 by @entity24 on behalf of @entity8			1
most @entity24 - @entity59 are barely on speaking terms with @entity8			1
we ( i am among them ) understand that our neighbor had no room in its economy for our dark - skinned , uneducated parents and grandparents , who were forced to go north			0
now , most of us reciprocate and have little room in our hearts for @entity8			1
our loyalty is to the @entity59			1
even if we were speaking to our @entity24 brethren , we 'd be conversing in different languages			0
most @entity8 speak @entity34 , and about 80 % of @entity59 latinos speak @entity108			1
@entity59 need to study up on this group			1
the @entity110 estimates that @entity17 , whose heritage can be traced to more than a dozen countries and who make up 17 % of the @entity59 population , will account for as much as 29 % by 2050			1
and while some @entity59 might like to believe that these figures are artificially high due to undocumented immigrants , these are @entity59 citizens and legal residents we 're talking about			1
these are just , as comedian @entity122 likes to say , the people who answer the door when the bell rings			0
about 70 % of this population will be @entity24 or @entity24 - @entity59			1
and when we arrive at the point where nearly 3 in 10 @entity59 are @entity126 , @entity17 will see our imprint just about everywhere -- food , language , sports , fashion , entertainment , business , pop culture and beyond			1
so what does it mean that @entity0 has gone back to its roots and become what it was before 1850 : a @entity126 state ? on the one hand , there is always the chance that , in a state such as @entity0 , this could be a kind of psychological tipping point where even the densest folks in commerce , media , academia and other fields finally get the message that @entity17 are an essential and productive part of the state 's economic engine			1
in the @entity19 , whatever business you 're in , and whatever goal you 're pursuing , if you 're not incorporating @entity17 into your vision and onto your team , then you 're leaving money on the table for your competition			2
on the other hand , those folks who worry about change might become even more fearful and hostile -- for it is fear that drives the immigration debate			0
@entity59 did n't just wake up one morning and discover the concept of " rule of law " and that the @entity59 shared a border with @entity8			1
those things have been around for quite a while			0
what 's new is the demographics			2
as soon as many non-hispanics began to see this writing on the wall , they started building more walls			0
so , if enough @entity59 deny and resist the new reality and try to -- as they say south of the border , cover the sun with their thumb -- things might get worse before they get better			2
there could be more conflict and hostility , as @entity17 become frustrated with efforts to thwart their ascendancy			2
of course , hispanics themselves have the greatest power to determine their destiny			0
we have to make better choices and stop being a cheap date for the political parties			0
we have to put the @entity59 , and our community , before our allegiance to any political party			2
most @entity17 are registered @entity200 , but this goes for @entity126 republicans , too			2
we have to elect better leaders and hold them accountable			0
we have to be as hard on our friends as we are on our enemies			0
we have to reflect now and then on what road we 're on , and change course if necessary			0
and we have to stop squabbling with one another , and make our community safe for diverse opinions that stray from the established narrative			0
there is reason for optimism			0
there are better days ahead , and nothing to fear			0
hispanics did n't just come to @entity59			1
in @entity0 , and the rest of the @entity89 , it was the other way around			2
now we are one and the same .			0

@entity219 : @entity17 part of @entity0 cultural landscape
he says last month @entity17 overtook whites as state 's largest racial / ethnic group
he says nativists balk , but @entity8 not new ; they are long woven into fabric , loyal to @entity59
@entity219 : @entity59 need to study up on this group , and hispanics need to harness clout
