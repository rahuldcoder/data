@entity0 of @entity2 has inherited the throne from his older brother and with it a host of pressing challenges in a turbulent region			1
to the south , @entity9 is in chaos			2
to the north , the militant group @entity12 is wreaking havoc in @entity15 and @entity16			2
more broadly , @entity2 remains locked in a regional cold war with @entity18			1
within the kingdom 's borders , @entity0 has to decide how to pace sensitive reforms while keeping a lid on extremism			0
the stakes are high in one of the leading regional powers in the @entity27 and a key @entity29 ally			0
" @entity2 has been critical to preserving some degree of regional stability in the face of a growing @entity18 threat , during the rise of @entity36 extremism that followed the @entity29 invasions of @entity38 and @entity15 , and during the new wave of upheavals that began in the spring of 2011 , " @entity39 , a @entity27 expert at the @entity40 , wrote in a commentary this month			1
here are some of the main challenges @entity0 now faces : the new king has been plunged straight into the deep end with a fast - developing crisis on @entity2 's southern border			1
the @entity51 government in @entity9 has crumbled amid sectarian unrest			1
the country 's president and prime minister resigned thursday night after a move by @entity58 rebels to gain power in the capital in recent days			0
sunni majority @entity2 , which provides energy and financial support to @entity9 and shares a long border with it , is looking on with growing anxiety , fearful of the prospect of another @entity58 - dominated state in the region			1
" this will terrify the @entity2 , just as the @entity73 uprising in @entity74 did , " said @entity1 intelligence and security analyst @entity70			2
" @entity2 , all these years , has avoided sending troops into @entity9			1
it 's a quagmire for the @entity2 , " said @entity70			1
" they 've got a reinforced border and they 've put a lot of troops down there			0
but , still , they are panicking			0
" @entity83 , a spokesman for the @entity84 in @entity85 , told @entity1 on wednesday that without @entity2 support , " @entity9 will become a failed state			1
" it 's not far from that already			0
the poorest country in the region , @entity9 is home to @entity92 , which @entity29 officials consider to be the most dangerous branch of the terrorist network , according to @entity1 terrorism analyst @entity96			2
the @entity9 crisis feeds into a broader issue for @entity2 : the growing influence of @entity18 in the region			1
@entity9 officials have frequently accused @entity18 of providing financial support and weapons to the @entity104 in an effort to control @entity9 's @entity107 coast , on one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes			1
" that makes @entity2 very uncomfortable , " said @entity1 global affairs analyst @entity111			0
" @entity2 , a @entity113 majority country , regards @entity73 - run @entity18 as a mortal enemy			1
both are facing each other off in a bizarre game of chess they 're playing across the @entity121 world			0
" tensions have simmered between @entity123 and @entity124 at least as far back as @entity18 's @entity125 in 1979			2
the conflict in @entity16 has been viewed as a proxy conflict between the two , with @entity18 supporting the regime of president @entity130 , and @entity2 helping rebel groups			1
but the rise of the @entity12 extremists amid the relentless bloodshed of the @entity16 war has complicated the equation			1
" there are signs by the @entity2 and the @entity18 that it is in their interests to de-escalate tensions to confront @entity12 , " said @entity137 , a fellow at @entity139 's @entity138			1
" but it 's impossible to move from hostility to alliance quickly			0
" although the two sides realize that @entity12 is a threat to some extent to both of them , they do n't think it is so big a threat as to move that fast to cooperation , " he said in november			0
the bloodthirsty seizure of large swathes of territory in @entity16 and @entity15 by @entity12 has created a major headache in the region for the @entity2			1
and the attempts of @entity12 leader @entity164 to style himself as spiritual leader of @entity166 presents a challenge to the @entity2 monarchy , which is responsible for @entity36 's two holiest cities , @entity170 and @entity171			1
" the @entity2 fear it as a potential domestic threat , turning @entity180 into a revolutionary political ideology rather than the pro-regime bulwark it has usually been in @entity2 , " says @entity173 @entity172 , @entity174 , a senior foreign policy fellow at the @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity177			0
@entity2 is considered to be a key @entity29 ally in the fight against @entity12			1
one of @entity0 's sons , prince @entity186 , was reportedly among the pilots who carried out the first airstrikes on @entity12 positions in @entity16 last year			2
but @entity0 also has some responsibility for @entity2 's backing of jihadist fighters in previous conflicts , according to @entity194 , a senior fellow at the @entity195			2
" @entity0 played a significant role in the 1980s and 1990s gathering support in the royal family for mujahedeen holy warriors in places like @entity38 , places like the @entity202 , " @entity194 told @entity1			0
" a number of these @entity38 and @entity202 veterans have in fact come back to @entity2 and sown continued radicalism			0
" the @entity2 government , though , has denied ever providing support to @entity12 , which is a splinter group of @entity92			1
@entity0 's predecessor , @entity209 , is credited with managing to ride out the ructions of the @entity211 that swept away other @entity121 rulers			0
but with a fast growing population in an unstable region , the royal family has no room for complacency			0
" @entity2 has faced , and will face , constant challenges in finding the pace of modernization and reform that pushes forward as fast as possible while retaining @entity2 popular support , meeting @entity2 's unique religious and cultural needs , and ensuring that evolution will not turn into either regression or revolution , " said @entity39			2
" as events in other parts of the region since 2011 have shown all too clearly , it is easy to get things terribly wrong and very hard to keep them going right , " he wrote			0
while some observers have applauded @entity209 's cautious reforms , others say he moved too slowly			0
" if you look at where @entity2 is today , it has n't actually moved that far from when he assumed the throne in 2005 , " @entity194 told @entity1			0
the monarchy needs to allow greater freedoms for women , improve the rights of the @entity58 minority , modernize the education system and give greater powers to elected bodies , according to @entity39			0
with the recent sharp drop in oil prices , officials will have to chart a careful course for the economy			0
@entity2 depends heavily on oil revenues to fund its government			2
" above all , the @entity2 government needs to ensure that its rapidly growing population will have meaningful jobs and futures , " @entity39 said .			2

@entity9 's @entity51 government has crumbled amid sectarian unrest
@entity2 also faces *difficulties* in its cold war with @entity18 and the fight against @entity12
