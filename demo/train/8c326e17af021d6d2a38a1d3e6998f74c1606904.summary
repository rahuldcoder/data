-- more than one and a half years have passed since a boyish - looking 22 - year - old @entity2 private was arrested , suspected to be behind the biggest intelligence leak in @entity5 history			1
much has been written about him			0
politicians , pundits , celebrities and protesters have had something to say			0
but the single voice that could tell the real story has never been heard			0
@entity15 , are you finally going to speak ? will you say anything when a military arraignment begins on friday at an @entity2 base in @entity19 , the first step in the government 's case that intends to figure out how hundreds of thousands of its classified @entity24 , @entity25 and diplomatic documents came to be published on @entity26 ? @entity15 is facing 22 charges of violating military code , ranging from theft of records to aiding the enemy			1
the latter charge is likely , experts say , to land @entity15 in prison for life			1
but , if a general sees fit , the law allows that @entity15 could be eligible for the death penalty , a historic turn in a case that is already unprecedented			1
so what has this young soldier from small - town @entity43 got to say for himself ? defense attorney @entity45 is n't saying whether his client will speak at the @entity47 , held to determine whether there 's enough evidence to merit a court - martial , which is expected to last a week			1
manning has been held at @entity54 ' @entity53 prison and will be transported for the hearing to @entity56 , where , incidentally , the @entity57 has its offices			0
security for media will be intense ; there are only 10 spots for reporters in the tiny courtroom , so most will be relegated to a media room with a single closed - circuit television showing the hearing			2
the military has said it will cut that feed whenever material it deems classified is discussed in the courtroom			1
an @entity74 lieutenant colonel , @entity45 has a reputation for cutthroat and creative military lawyering , his contemporaries tell @entity0			2
he is also an active blogger			0
he 's been posting about the @entity15 case , including his client 's alleged mistreatment at @entity80 , since taking the case in 2010			1
an attorney for the @entity83 says the group has paid about $ 150,000 in expenses toward @entity15 's defense , money raised mostly in small donated increments online			1
earlier this month , @entity45 hinted on his blog at how he might defend @entity15			1
he filed in court record , and then blogged , a kind of witness wish list			0
@entity45 said it described military personnel who , if he could call them , would testify that @entity15 behaved like an unhinged , potentially dangerous soldier on base in @entity25			1
@entity15 's superiors repeatedly missed chances to either remove him from his intelligence job or revoke his security clearance , the document said			1
read the entire witness filing a few days later , @entity45 posted another filing protesting the military 's apparent rejection of all but 10 of his requested witnesses			2
the military told @entity0 that it will not comment until friday 's hearing			2
" if @entity45 uses the defense -- the ' it 's not my fault , they did n't stop me ' -- that 's not going to fly with a military jury			2
that 's not even a defense , " said @entity116 , a criminal defense attorney who has tried at least 150 @entity47 hearings and many court - martial trials			2
" the problem is that ( the defense ) is not really addressing the charges themselves			2
you 're not saying ' i did n't leak anything , you ca n't prove it , ' " explained @entity116 , who served two tours as an @entity2 defense lawyer and has worked as a special assistant @entity5 attorney and as an @entity2 chief of military justice			2
psychological problems military juries typically do n't respond well to defense strategies that try to evoke sympathy for a defendant based on his or her alleged psychological problems , he said			2
" to them , psychological problems are , like , ' who cares ? ' the military takes a lot of people who have psychological problems , ( then ) they turn away and act like they do n't see it			2
it will not be a shock to a military panel -- the jury -- and they are n't going to be appalled by that			2
" @entity116 said he 's tried several cases in which his clients ' mental instability was known by military co-workers and superiors , yet those in power did little or nothing before a crime occurred			2
@entity116 pointed to the case of maj. @entity163 to illustrate his point			0
@entity163 was an @entity2 psychiatrist who will face a court - martial in march			2
@entity163 is accused of killing 13 people and wounding dozens in a shooting november 5 , 2009 , at @entity168 , @entity169			0
a @entity171 report earlier this year found that various federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies missed an opportunity to prevent the rampage , even though they had information that @entity163 supported @entity178 extremism , had communicated with a terrorism suspect , and acted in a way that waved red flags about his mental stability			1
the report mirrored a @entity185 review which said that @entity163 continued to advance despite concerns from others around him			0
in early november , victims ' families filed suit asking $ 750 million from the military for failing to prevent the bloodbath			0
in @entity15 's case , if the prevention argument wo n't work , @entity116 says , neither will painting him as a whistle - blower			1
in the opinion of some observers , including @entity199 leaker @entity198 , the documents published by @entity26 deserved to be brought to light and @entity15 was " brave " -- in @entity198 's words -- to leak the information			1
others who support @entity15 's actions contend that , at worst , war crimes and an effort by the @entity5 and its allies to cover up atrocities were revealed by the leaks			1
that was the general thrust of @entity213 's coverage on the intelligence , which @entity213 independently examined			0
numerous reports , including those in the @entity217 , which also independently analyzed the documents , said that the @entity26 disclosures revealed widespread corruption in both wars , a gross waste of money and mistreatment of detainees			0
" if you 're going to appeal to a military jury , whistle - blower does n't work , " @entity116 said			1
" the thinking they have is that when you sign up for a certain job in military intelligence and you manage data that is secret , you have a duty to protect that information			1
" @entity236 , overcharged @entity238 may have better luck if the defense concentrates on four other arguments , the attorney suggests			0
first , @entity45 should try to demonstrate that the documents @entity15 allegedly downloaded were not marked individually as classified , and therefore he could not be held accountable for knowingly taking secret intelligence			1
he might also want to present the argument , bandied in numerous media reports , that the information @entity15 had access to has been overclassified			1
in other words , it 's not necessary that a cable about @entity252 royals having wild parties be classified in the same way as a cable about @entity257 's nuclear activity			0
the defense attorney should also drive home the idea that the government has gone overboard with its charges -- especially aiding the enemy -- without proving that any actual harm was caused by the leaks , @entity116 said			1
" this is n't a case of someone sneaking behind enemy lines and handing over passwords to the computer system or giving a key to the back entrance to the military base , " said @entity116			1
" this is someone who downloaded some information he should n't have , which has not been proven to have harmed anyone or national security			0
" third , the defense can try to show that @entity15 wo n't get a fair trial due to comments president @entity283 made last year at a fundraiser			1
@entity283 said that @entity15 broke the law			1
" i have to abide by certain classified information , " @entity283 said on a video posted on @entity287			0
" if i was to release stuff , information that i 'm not authorized to release , i 'm breaking the law			0
... we 're a nation of laws			0
we do n't individually make our own decisions about how the laws operate			0
... he broke the law			0
" there is n't anyone who reports to the commander in chief who would want to go against that , said @entity116 , so the case seems unfair from the start			0
a controversial witness if @entity116 were defending @entity15 , he said , his first priority would be to attack the credibility of @entity307 , a @entity308 hacker who says @entity15 reached out to him in an internet chat and confessed to downloading intelligence and giving it to @entity26			1
neither @entity15 nor his counsel has confirmed or denied that @entity15 was indeed the one writing the instant messages in the chat log			1
@entity26 and the news organizations that published stories based on the leaked material have never identified who gave it to them			0
@entity307 told @entity0 last year , and reiterated in interviews throughout the past year , that he turned @entity320 in to the @entity321 because he believed that what @entity15 wrote to him could be used to harm national security			1
in an unrelated incident , @entity307 was convicted in 2004 on one count of computer crimes after breaking into the @entity217 , @entity327 and @entity328 computer systems and has reportedly breached @entity331 's company network and broken into the internal networks of @entity333 and @entity334			0
@entity307 has repeatedly told @entity0 over the past year that his hacking is in his past and he had altruistic intentions when it came to turning in @entity15			1
@entity307 was on the list of witnesses @entity45 wants to question at the @entity47 hearing			0
reached via e-mail late wednesday , @entity307 responded to @entity0 's question about whether he would testify			0
@entity307 wrote that he was in a " pre-hearing meeting			0
" he e-mailed , " i 'll be in the area , but ca n't confirm that i 'll testify			0
" " i would put that guy on trial and make him lay out the evidence he has against @entity15 , " said @entity116			2
" he would be the weakest link , to me , in the government 's case			0

@entity15 is believed to have leaked classified intelligence
the 23 - year - old soldier from @entity43 faces 22 charges of violating military law
the most serious charge is aiding the enemy , which would likely result in a life sentence
