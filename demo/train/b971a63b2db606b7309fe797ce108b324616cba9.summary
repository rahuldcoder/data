@entity0 -- @entity3 's elderly mother will soon tell jurors about her most famous son , as the wrongful death trial of his last concert promoter reaches a midpoint			1
jurors heard one of @entity3 's former doctors testify last week that the top producer of @entity3 's comeback concerts knew about the singer 's drug dependency on a previous tour			1
@entity17 , 83 , has sat on the front row of the @entity0 courtroom almost every one of the 46 days of testimony			2
she 's shed tears , sometimes laughed , and at one point last week shouted out the name of one of her son 's movies when a witness could n't remember it			0
her emotional testimony will be followed by @entity31 lawyers presenting their defense , which they 've warned will include " ugly stuff " to prove that @entity3 was responsible for his own death			1
@entity3 's mother and three children contend @entity31 is liable because it hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity39 , the physician convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the pop icon 's overdose death			1
@entity39 admitted giving @entity3 nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol , which the coroner ruled killed the singer on june 25 , 2009			0
@entity31 lawyers argue their executives had no way of knowing that @entity39 -- whom they say @entity3 chose and controlled -- was giving him the dangerous infusions in the privacy of @entity3 's bedroom to treat his insomnia			1
" they were a concert promoter			0
how could they know ? " @entity31 lead lawyer @entity56 asked during his opening statement 12 weeks ago			0
" do n't be a @entity58 " @entity3 lawyers argue that @entity31 co-ceo @entity60 -- the top producer of @entity3 's " @entity61 " comeback tour -- should have known the hazards of hiring @entity39 because of his personal experience with @entity3 and his work with other artists , including as a promoter on @entity69 's last tour			1
@entity60 denied in his testimony that he ever knew that @entity3 had drug dependency problems while touring			1
but video testimony shown to the jury last week contradicts @entity60 's claim			1
@entity1 obtained video segments from the deposition of dr. @entity77 , who served as @entity3 's doctor during his 1993 " @entity82 " tour , which ended early because the singer entered a drug rehabilitation program			1
" i said i think we 're going to have a problem , " @entity77 testified that he told @entity60 , who was then serving as a tour manager on the " @entity82 " tour			1
@entity3 lawyer @entity90 : " did you tell mr. @entity60 that you thought mr. @entity3 had a dependency on opiates ? " @entity77 : " yes			1
" @entity90 : " and what did mr. @entity60 say to you ? " @entity77 : " he said , ' do n't be a dr. @entity58			1
' " @entity90 : " and by @entity58 , was he talking about @entity69 ? " @entity77 : " yes			0
he was @entity69 ' doctor			0
and i think @entity69 died with like 14 different chemicals in his system			0
and he was kind of warning me that , you know , do n't get all infatuated where you start administering meds to a rock star and have the rock star overdose and die on you			0
" dr. @entity58 , known as " dr. @entity58 , " was " the doctor whose overprescription of drugs to @entity69 had led to @entity69 ' death , " according to a court filing by @entity3 lawyers			1
@entity69 collapsed in the bathroom of @entity108 , his @entity109 , @entity110 , mansion , on august 16 , 1977 , at the age of 42			0
while his death was ruled the result of an irregular heartbeat , the autopsy report was sealed amid accusations that abuse of prescription drugs caused the problem			0
@entity58 said later he was treating @entity69 for insomnia			0
he was charged with overprescribing drugs to @entity69 , but he was acquitted			0
he later lost his medical license in another case			0
@entity69 's death came days before he was to begin a new tour organized by the concert promoter @entity31 , the company that gave @entity60 his start in the music industry			1
one of his jobs was working with @entity69 in his last years on the road , he testified			0
@entity3 " needed to be detoxed " @entity77 testified that he and @entity60 had discussions about @entity3 's use of @entity132 , morphine and other opiates during the " @entity82 " tour			1
" we thought we needed to do an intervention , that he needed to be detoxed , " @entity77 said			0
the tour came to an early and abrupt end when actress @entity140 flew to @entity141 to lead an intervention that convinced @entity3 to enter a rehab facility in @entity144			2
@entity77 said @entity60 called him again in the spring of 2009 as preparations for @entity3 's comeback tour were beginning			1
" hey , @entity149 , you may have another chance , " the doctor quoted @entity60 as saying			2
" @entity3 's doing another tour to @entity144 and he 's going to want to take a physician			1
" " were you interested in going on that tour to @entity144 ? " @entity90 asked			0
" very much so , " @entity77 replied			0
@entity77 said he had five to 10 conversations with @entity60 about the job with @entity3 and he offered to take it for $ 40,000 a month			1
but @entity77 , who is now an addiction specialist , said he had one requirement -- that @entity3 be clean of drugs			2
instead , @entity60 agreed to pay @entity39 $ 150,000 a month to work as @entity3 's personal physician			1
drug dependent , not addicted a drug addiction expert testified earlier this month that there was " not a lot of evidence to support " the belief that @entity3 was addicted to drugs , but that he was " drug dependent			2
" if he was an addict , @entity3 " would be taking drugs that were not prescribed by a medical professional , taking larger amounts than prescribed and have drug - seeking behavior , " dr. @entity170 testified			2
evidence shows @entity3 sought drugs from a number of doctors , but that was not inappropriate because he needed them " to treat a legitimate medical problem , " including back pain , scalp pain and dermatologic issues , @entity170 testified			2
the painkillers that forced @entity3 to end his 1993 " @entity82 " tour early so he could enter a rehab program were taken to relieve the pain from scalp surgery needed to repair burns suffered when filming a @entity192 commercial , @entity170 said			2
the burns left scars on damaged nerves in his scalp , which becomes " excitable tissue " that " can be firing just like the nerve , " he said			0
the result " can be very painful , like a burning kind of pain -- persistent , sharp , shooting kind of pain , " he said			0
" it 's very uncomfortable and one of the most difficult to treat			0
" pain relief is a legitimate use of opioid drugs and a person can function normally if they are taken under a doctor 's care , he said			0
@entity3 went from 1993 until 2008 without using @entity132 , @entity170 said			0
the doctor conceded under cross-examination by an @entity31 lawyer , however , that a gap in available medical records may be misleading			2
@entity77 testified that many of his records for @entity3 had been lost			2
@entity3 's use of sedatives was an effort to treat his chronic insomnia , @entity170 said			1
if the underlying sleep problem could be resolved , the chances of ending @entity3 's use of the drugs would have been good , he said .			1

@entity17 's testimony will be followed by defense from @entity31 lawyers
@entity1 obtained video clips from the deposition of a former @entity3 tour doctor
" i think we 're going to have a problem , " dr. @entity77 said he told @entity60
@entity31 exec @entity60 denied @entity77 told him about @entity3 's drug use
