while much of the world is focused on the @entity3 incursion into the @entity4 of @entity5 , another long - term move may allow the former @entity7 navy to dominate @entity9 interests to the north : the @entity11			1
the rapid melting of the @entity13 is quickly creating a new variety of challenges that have the potential to cause significant global damage if they remain unaddressed			0
the @entity21 administration 's policy correctly recognizes that the @entity9 has profoundly important economic and cultural interests in the @entity11 but regrettably reveals very little about what the federal government will be doing outside of the science field			1
while recent @entity9 policies either dance around the core issues , or worse , do not acknowledge that they exist , the @entity3 are taking the lead on @entity11 policy			1
after all , the @entity11 is in their backyard , too			0
moreover , @entity3 -- as if to highlight the value they place on their navy and renaissance as a maritime nation -- took control of the strategic @entity4 , assuring and securing warm water @entity41 access to the global commons			0
in light of these recent events , it would be wise for @entity46 to seriously consider the economic potential and security vulnerabilities that exist on or near the @entity9 @entity11 coastline			1
overwhelmingly , the @entity9 @entity11 policy debate echoes past concerns of the @entity52			1
consequently , many in the policy community are pushing a heavy science and no - development agenda to preserve the pristine character of the region			0
the recently issued @entity59 is a case in point : it talks extensively about the @entity64 scientific mission and uses the terms " sustainable development " and preservation of the unspoiled area as important national goals			0
but just saying " no " ignores the fact that the precious @entity11 mineral and oil and gas resources will help assure the @entity9 is able , over time , to achieve and then maintain its energy independence			1
science is incredibly important , as is safe and responsible development of the @entity11 , but our agencies and scientists need to approach these issues with a greater sense of urgency			1
arguably , the science needs to be a component of a detailed national action , but that 's only a fraction of good @entity9 policy			2
@entity9 @entity11 policy should prioritize four things : one : demonstrate leadership in the @entity11 and develop a strategy and policy to match			1
the @entity9 has no leadership in the high north and @entity3 does , which is a great concern for our allies			2
two : invest in infrastructure , @entity41 and @entity101 to support @entity9 security and commercial interests in the @entity11			1
the key here is to develop the policy that drives those requirements so we are not " late to need			0
" three : demonstrate leadership in the maritime domain worldwide -- and not retreat as we are doing by default in the @entity11			0
four : facilitate and further develop offshore natural resources in the high north / @entity114 and the national , international , maritime and geopolitical governance structures that will underpin those enterprises			0
@entity46 , in less than two years , will assume a leadership role when it becomes chair for the @entity120			0
unfortunately , the @entity64 policy and @entity122 2014 do not articulate what the @entity9 @entity11 leadership agenda will entail			1
the reality is ignoring the issues and choosing not to participate in the @entity11 will not make the issues go away			2
yes , budgets are challenging , but the @entity11 is no different from any other international frontier or global common where the @entity9 has interests			2
we need to protect it and demonstrate leadership in the maritime domain -- not retreat			0
so , too , our policy makers need to be looking beyond our shores to @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , the @entity120 , international oil companies and @entity143 for help in solving this governance challenge			0
the last thing that any of the @entity11 states can afford is to back into a @entity3 - generated crisis with no resources or a plan			2
the time is now for more @entity9 leadership to ensure the @entity11 becomes a safe , secure and prosperous region in which to live and work			1
join us on @entity155 / @entity154 .			0

@entity157 , @entity158 : @entity9 @entity11 policy needs to look more at security issues
@entity3 , they say , already holds a dominant position in the region
scientific *exploration* is important , but that should not be the solitary focus , they say
