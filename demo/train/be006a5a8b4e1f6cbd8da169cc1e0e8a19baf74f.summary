@entity0 -- @entity3 's summertime hit " @entity4 " is an illegal rip - off of @entity8 's " @entity10 , " @entity7 's children claim in court documents filed wednesday			1
fans , journalists and music experts immediately recognized similarities between @entity7 's 1977 hit and the 2013 's summertime smash , @entity7 's heirs contend			1
the controversy is a high - stakes legal fight involving an alleged conflict of interest with @entity23 - @entity22 , the music publisher half - owned by @entity25 's estate			0
@entity7 's heirs not only accuse @entity3 and " @entity4 " co-writers @entity26 and " @entity28 " @entity28 of copying @entity7 's song , but they also contend @entity23 - @entity22 failed to meet its responsibility to protect the copyright			1
the @entity7 family contracted with @entity22 after the singer - songwriter 's death to administer his music catalog , but it also represents @entity26 ' songs , according to a counterclaim filed wednesday in response to a lawsuit filed by @entity3 , @entity26 and @entity28			1
the publisher , however , refused to sue the " @entity4 " writers when the family asked them to do so , the @entity7 's lawyer said			2
as a result they " reluctantly " included @entity23 - @entity22 as a defendant in their counterclaim , he said			0
the " @entity4 " writers filed their pre-emptive lawsuit in august asking a federal judge to declare that their song was not a copyright infringement on @entity7 's work amid public rumblings about the similarities			2
@entity3 's inital lawsuit contends there are " no similarities " between his song and @entity7 's " other than commonplace musical elements " " being reminiscent of a ' sound ' is not copyright infringement , " his complaint argues			1
the @entity64 counterclaim includes @entity3 quotes from an interview with @entity66 published in july			0
" @entity26 and i were in the studio making a couple records , and then on the third day i told him i wanted to do something kinda like @entity8 's ' @entity10 , ' that kind of feel ' cause it 's one of my favorite songs of all time , " @entity3 reportedly said			1
" so he started messing with some drums and then he started going ' hey , hey , hey ' and about an hour and a half later we had the whole record finished			0

@entity90 writer @entity89 : " and that bass line came right from @entity8 's no. 1 hit from the summer of ' 77 , ' got to @entity88 '			2
" @entity99 magazine contributor @entity97 : " when i first heard @entity3 's ' @entity4 , ' my reaction was the same as millions of other @entity96 fans : hey , that 's @entity8 's ' @entity10			1
' " vice magazine music critic @entity101 : " you probably do n't feel guilty for liking ' @entity4			0
' maybe that 's because it was originally a @entity8 song ( " @entity10 " ) and @entity8 is ... awesome			2
" the filing by the heirs also includes a report from musicologist @entity108 , who identified a " constellation of at least eight substantially similar compositional features between the two works			2
" " the signature phrase , vocal hook , backup vocal hook , their variations , and the keyboard and bass lines " are substantially similar and they share " departures from convention such as the unusual cowbell instrumentation , omission of guitar and use of male falsetto , " it said			0
@entity7 's heirs also accuse @entity3 of stealing from their father 's 1976 hit " after the dance " when he recorded " @entity131 " in 2011			1
those tunes " contain substantially similar compositional material in their choruses , including the melodies of their hooks , " the @entity7 filing contends			0
