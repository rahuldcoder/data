@entity0 , @entity1 -- " some people believe football is a matter of life and death ... i assure you it is much , much more important than that			1
" as @entity14 , the legendary former manager of @entity1 club @entity15 , pointed out shortly before he passed away in 1981 , the significance of the beautiful game can never be underestimated -- and that does n't just apply to fans of the sport , either			0
soccer can affect lives on a national and international scale , inspiring revolutions and causing wars as well as having the capability to create peace and lift entire nations			0
the " @entity30 " between @entity31 and @entity32 in 1969 is perhaps the most famous example of the sport 's wider implications			0
the two @entity34 nations famously came to blows following their qualification match for the 1970 @entity37			1
@entity38 's @entity37 predictions but this was n't the first time , and definitely wo n't be the last , that the worlds of football and politics collide with remarkable results			1
@entity46 manipulates the " man in black , " 1934 " @entity50 " was determined to use this @entity37 on home soil to showcase his fascist @entity49			2
@entity46 had his own trophy created for the event -- the @entity53 -- which was six times the size of the @entity54 , and to this day allegations remain the tournament was fixed so that only @entity49 would collect it			0
according to the @entity59 's " @entity61 " book by @entity60 , there were suggestions that the @entity49 dictator himself picked the referees			0
in the semifinal against @entity69 , @entity46 's @entity67 team won 2 - 1 , but after the game their opponents complained the game was fixed			2
the @entity37 's missing men " the referee even played for them , " said @entity75 striker @entity74			1
" when i passed for the ball out to the right wing , one of our players , @entity83 , ran for it and the referee headed it back to the @entity49			2
@entity75 star humiliates nazis , 1938 @entity69 had one of the game 's greatest sides in the 1930s , but when the @entity89 annexed their neighbors , the nation 's " wunderteam " were forced to withdraw from the @entity37 and merge with @entity95			1
@entity98 striker @entity98 so opposed his nation 's loss of independence that he refused to play for @entity95			1
he pleaded old age , but @entity95 's manager @entity103 would later recall : " i almost had the impression that discomfort and rejection , linked to the political developments , had prompted his refusal			1
" who will be the @entity37 's best player ? during a so - called " @entity111 " to mark the merging of the two sides , @entity98 made his feelings quite clear in a 2 - 0 win for @entity69			1
according to @entity118 historian @entity117 's book " @entity116 , " the center - forward scored his beloved country 's first and then , when the second goal went in , he danced in celebration in front of @entity125 officials			2
in 1939 , @entity98 and his girlfriend were killed in his apartment by a gas leak			0
controversy still reigns over whether it was murder or suicide -- or just an accident			0
@entity132 play for independence , 1958 halfway through @entity132 's @entity136 , the @entity135 national team called up a handful of @entity132 playing in the @entity135 soccer league for the @entity37 in @entity139			1
given the chance of glory , fame and fortune , the players chose national identity instead			0
rather than attend a pre-tournament friendly against @entity147 , they decided to flee @entity135 , gather at the headquarters of the @entity149 in @entity150 and launch an " illegal " national team , risking arrest for desertion in the process			2
who will win the @entity37 ? @entity156 had won the @entity135 championship with @entity158 before getting the call from @entity160 , but decided there were more important matters at stake than his personal success			1
" i did n't hesitate , " he told @entity166 , author of " @entity167			0
" " okay , i would have to give up my club			0
and yes , i was thinking about the @entity37 , but what did that count for in comparison with my country 's independence ? " 4			1
@entity175 players crack under @entity177 pressure , 1974 it 's remembered as one of the @entity37 's funniest moments , but the truth is much darker			1
already 3 - 0 down and facing a @entity186 free - kick , @entity175 's right - back @entity182 seemingly forgot the rules of the game , charged at the ball and hoofed it away before the whistle had even been blown			2
the @entity192 , the first @entity194 nation to reach the finals , had already been humiliated 9 - 0 by @entity196 before losing 2 - 0 to @entity197 , and were told by president @entity199 's henchmen that if they lost to @entity200 by more than three goals they would n't be allowed to return home			2
ten @entity37 headlines yet to be written " do you think i 'd deliberately make myself look like an idiot ? you have to remember we were playing for our lives , " he said in the book " @entity209 , the @entity210 " by @entity208			2
@entity182 's act of " madness , " it turns out , was in fact a very sane attempt to waste time			0
the @entity118 nation divided , 1974 @entity95 versus @entity219 at the 1974 @entity37 was perhaps the most politically - charged match of all time			1
after the @entity223 , the divided nation had become the main arena for the @entity225 , and this fixture in @entity227 represented a head - to - head between the two ideologies			0
although the game was actually the last in the group and it had become clear that both teams would qualify from the group stage , that did not diminish the tension surrounding the clash			0
ten shocking @entity37 moments with home advantage , @entity240 champions @entity238 were favorites but it was the @entity118 @entity243 who scored the only goal of the game			2
@entity95 heralded their triumph , but the victory was rendered a little hollow after they were knocked out in the next round and their bitter rivals went on to win the tournament			2
@entity256 junta swaps grain for glory , 1978 @entity256 's junta , which had seized power just a couple of years earlier , was determined to use the @entity37 it was hosting as propaganda for the regime			1
according to a 1986 article by journalist @entity267 of @entity269 's @entity268 , and supported by @entity270 in his book " how they stole the @entity275 , " the junta used bribery and intimidation to help win the cup			2
controversy over new @entity37 ball in the group stages , @entity256 needed to beat @entity278 by four goals in their last game to progress			1
general @entity282 made a timely pre-match visit to the @entity278 dressing - room to talk to the players about " @entity287 unity " before the host nation rattled six past a side that had previously held eventual finalists @entity291 to a goalless draw			1
@entity267 claimed that in the weeks following the @entity278 game , an impromptu cargo of 35,000 tonnes of wheat left @entity256 for @entity296 and that the military regime issued an interest - free loan of $ 50 million to the @entity278 government			1
@entity301 's football revolution , 1998 they may have been two of the least significant footballing sides at @entity135 ' 98 , but nevertheless this fixture caught the world 's imagination because @entity301 and the @entity307 had been at loggerheads since the @entity309 in 1979			1
although political relations were strained , the clash of civilizations never quite happened on the pitch			0
instead , both sides showed the utmost respect , swapping flowers , gifts and photographs before the kick - off			0
the @entity301 won 2 - 1 , but , celebrations back home had a destabilizing effect as hundreds of thousands of young people , including women , partied in the streets in defiance of government warnings			1
" in my neighborhood everybody goes out into the streets , " one young @entity301 told the @entity59 's @entity328			1
" it 's a good excuse for boys and girls to mix , and in a way it 's political , because it 's a demand for social change			0
@entity95 enjoys " @entity339 , " 2006 the tournament slogan " a time to make friends " pretty much said it all			1
the organizers of @entity95 2006 set out to woo the world , and in the process the country learned to love themselves			1
a combination of a flawless summer and coach @entity350 's free - flowing football injected a feel - good factor back into the national psyche , and @entity353 realized they could enjoy patriotism again -- or as the local media billed it , " partyotism			1
" " in the space of one month , @entity350 managed to bring together a society ashamed of displays of nationalism and still divided along @entity363 lines , turning @entity95 into a nation of face - painting , flag - waving patriots , " @entity60 said in his " @entity61 " book			1
" never mind the final , " @entity269 's @entity368 newspaper wrote			0
" @entity353 are the real @entity37 winners			2
the @entity371 refuse to play nicely , 2008 @entity372 both successfully managed to qualify for @entity373 2010 , but there were plenty of bad - tempered squabbles along the way			0
the bickering got so bad that world governing body @entity379 eventually had to intervene after @entity381 announced it would not let the @entity373 play its national anthem or wave its flag on their territory			0
so determined were the @entity381 that they were even prepared to play their " home " game abroad			0
in the end , the fixture took place in @entity392 , where the @entity381 coach complained that their rivals had poisoned their food			0
in a statement about the match , the @entity372 's football association said : " it was beyond all doubt that the incident was a product of a deliberate act perpetrated by adulterated foodstuff as [ the players ] could not get up all of a sudden just before the match			2
" according to a report by the @entity59 , the @entity373 's soccer federation -- @entity408 -- said a sports doctor had examined the @entity381 players and found no serious problem			1
football diplomacy between old enemies , 2008 - 09 serious sport is war minus the shooting , remarked @entity1 author @entity417			0
so it was refreshing last year when @entity419 and @entity420 used the beautiful game to make peace			0
the leaders of the two countries met up to watch a @entity37 qualifier between their nations after almost a century of bitterness following the killing of hundreds of thousands of @entity419 by @entity420 during @entity429			0
@entity420 president @entity430 attended the initial game in @entity419 in 2008 , which the hosts lost 2 - 0 , and his counterpart @entity434 agreed to join him for the return fixture the following year for further thawing of diplomatic relations			0
no doubt the fact that neither side had a chance of qualifying for @entity373 helped keep things civil .			0

@entity256 's right - wing junta allegedly bribed @entity278 with grain and a $ *50m* loan in 1978
organizers of @entity95 2006 set out to woo the world -- and in doing so lifted its people
when @entity301 beat @entity307 at the @entity453 , celebrations in @entity452 had a destabilizing effect
@entity132 players go @entity457 rather than represent *colonial* masters @entity135 at @entity37
