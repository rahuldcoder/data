there once was a time , many years ago , when the sounds of bagpipes struck fear into the stomachs of @entity5			2
but today mine was responding differently			2
because , come sunset , i will have tasted the world 's best bowl of porridge			1
the @entity13 village of @entity14 is known as the gateway to the @entity17 mountains -- and for one weekend last month it was also the epicentre of the porridge world			1
challengers from around the globe traveled here to win the @entity23 , the prize coveted by every competitor in the @entity26			1
to start the ceremonies , kilted pipers led the cooks from the bridge along the main street , and to the village hall			1
at the head of the parade were the judges , holding aloft the prize , glittering in the morning sunshine			2
master of ceremonies @entity39 raised a glass of whiskey in solemn tribute to the mighty meal : " ladies and gentlemen we drink a toast to the porridge , " he said			1
" to the porridge ! " the cooks roared in reply , downing their tots in one			1
their enthusiasm is being echoed in diners across @entity55			2
porridge is becoming big business , worth $ 400 million in the @entity55 alone			1
fast food stores in @entity60 such as @entity61 's , @entity62 and @entity58 sell thousands of instant porridge pots every week			1
more @entity64 : @entity65 brings @entity66 to @entity13 in @entity14 , the village hall was decorated with the flags of many nations , from the @entity70 to @entity71 -- and even from across the border in @entity73			1
the @entity23 rewards the maker of the best traditional porridge -- a seemingly simple blend of three ingredients : oatmeal , water and salt			1
however i was assured even the most experienced chefs find it almost impossible to produce the same porridge twice in a row			1
@entity86 was @entity87 in 2010			2
i know this because he bears a tattoo on his right arm declaring the fact			2
he has studied spurtle technique closely and invented a double - backed spoon which he calls a " @entity94 , " which he believes gives him an advantage over those to whom he has n't managed to sell one			2
" you should always stir with your right hand , always stir while standing up and you should always stir clockwise because it keeps the devil at bay , " he told me			2
more @entity64 : @entity105 's cheap , clean energy with a thirty - minute time limit per heat , tension mounted as the clock ticked down			0
each competitor poured out the required three bowls of their best brew			0
the steaming porridge was then collected on trays and carried through to the judges ' room			1
the table strained under the weight of the bowls			0
each was secretly numbered to protect the anonymity of the competitors			0
the terminology used was clearly technical to my untrained ears			0
" that 's foisty " ... " claggy " ... " snottery " ... that 's a curling puck , " one said			0
" i like that , it 's quite nutty ... " " that one 's too thick ... it 's bland ... it 's gloopy			0
" more and more bowls arrived			0
one trio turned up with firework sparklers showering the table			0
another declared itself as " @entity140 " a mix of porridge and kedgeree - the curry - flavoured smoked fish , egg and rice dish beloved by officers of the @entity148			1
more @entity64 : @entity149 turns clock back on siestas " och it 's too hot ! " exclaimed one judge			0
" it 's an abomination , it 's disgusting			0
" you could hear a spurtle drop as the judge prepared to reveal the identity of this year 's champion			0
it was gaelic singer @entity162 , the gentle giant who won in 2011 but lost the @entity165 to an @entity73 last year			0
there were tears in his eyes as he accepted the award to cheers and applause echoing around the rafters of the village hall			1
" it 's a fun event and we should n't get too emotional but it 's got a pull this thing and my only regret is that last year 's champion was n't here to be put in his place but there it is , " he said			0
" we do n't mind people coming here to win the spurtle but they should bow to the master when he 's been anointed			0
" next year the competition will take place within two weeks of @entity13 's referendum on whether to become independent of the @entity55 if @entity162 were to repeat his success in the @entity23 , he could become the first world champion of an independent @entity13			1
now there 's a stirring thought .			0

the @entity13 village of @entity14 is host to the @entity26
competition to create the best oatmeal gloop is fierce , and national pride is on the line
porridge is big business , and making the *perfect* bowl is not always easy
@entity205 attends the competition and is there when the winner collects the " @entity23 "
