@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration sent mixed signals wednesday on its stance on a no - fly zone in @entity7 , with secretary of state @entity8 saying @entity10 backing was essential while @entity12 spokesman @entity11 left the door open to the @entity14 acting unilaterally or in concert with @entity17 allies			1
some critics , as well as top @entity19 such as sen. @entity20 of @entity21 , have called for a stronger @entity14 response to the @entity7 violence , including the possible imposition of a no - fly zone that would prevent @entity7 military aircraft from attacking the @entity7 people			2
president @entity3 has made clear he wants any military response to come from the international community , to prevent @entity7 leader @entity30 from blaming the @entity14 for his predicament			0
@entity34 emphasized that point wednesday in an interview with @entity37 , saying the administration seeks to avoid " any room for anyone , including col. @entity30 , to say that ' this is n't about my people , this is about outsiders			0
' " she noted that the @entity45 and @entity46 governments were bringing a draft resolution on international action to the @entity10 , saying : " i think it 's very important that there be a @entity10 decision on whatever might be done			2
" " we believe it 's important that this not be an @entity14 , or a @entity17 , or a @entity56 effort			1
it needs to be an international one , " @entity34 said			0
approval by the @entity60 for international military intervention in @entity7 , including a no - fly zone , is considered unlikely due to expected opposition from @entity64 and @entity65			1
both countries are believed to be reluctant to set a precedent of @entity10 - supported military action in an internal conflict			0
@entity34 acknowledged opposition to a no - fly zone from within the @entity60 , but said efforts continued to come up with an acceptable package			1
she also emphasized the need to have @entity77 nations and bodies such as the @entity79 in support			0
a few hours later , @entity11 told reporters at the @entity12 that @entity10 backing was just one possible form of the international support sought for any military intervention in @entity7			1
" it is our strong preference in this situation and many others that we act together with our international partners , " said @entity11 , who then added that " we always reserve the right , @entity17 does rather , as does the @entity14 , to act on our own			1
" at the @entity94 , spokesman @entity93 also stopped short of insisting on @entity10 backing , instead saying : " it 's always desirable			1
" in a letter dated march 5 to the @entity97 , @entity7 's @entity98 -- the opposition movement seeking to oust @entity30 -- asked for the international community to " fulfill its obligations to protect the @entity7 people from any further genocide and crimes against humanity without any direct military intervention on @entity7 soil			0
" @entity11 and other administration officials contend the @entity14 already has moved quickly in the crisis by freezing $ 30 billion in @entity14 assets of @entity30 , supporting further @entity10 sanctions on @entity7 and sending military aircraft to help transport foreign nationals who fled the fighting there			2
at the same time , top @entity14 defense officials including defense secretary @entity117 warn that imposing such a no - fly zone amounts to an act of war that requires major resources and political will			2
on wednesday , @entity11 reiterated the @entity12 stance that all options remain on the table regarding @entity7 , and he specified that a possible no - fly zone was being actively discussed by both the @entity14 and @entity17			1
overall , though , the @entity3 administration has tried to downplay the possibility of imposing a no - fly zone without significant international backing , especially from the @entity77 world			0
asked about it sunday on the @entity136 program " @entity133 , @entity12 chief of staff @entity132 complained that people calling for such a move " talk about it like it 's a game or a video game or something			0
" @entity3 , in response to questions about the @entity14 response in @entity7 , told reporters last week that that it was important to ensure that the @entity7 people feel " full ownership " for any transformation and cited @entity151 's recent revolution as an example			2
" we did not see anti-american sentiment arising out of that movement in @entity151 precisely because they felt that we had n't tried to engineer or impose a particular outcome , but rather they owned it , " @entity3 said .			0
