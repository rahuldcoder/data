@entity0 , @entity1 -- there 's no reason @entity1 's spat with internet search giant @entity7 should hurt relations with the @entity9 , @entity1 's foreign ministry said tuesday			1
a day earlier , @entity7 announced that it had stopped censoring search results in @entity1			1
" the @entity7 incident is just an individual action taken by one company			0
i ca n't see it having any impact on @entity1 - @entity9 relations , unless someone wants to politicize it , " foreign ministry spokesman @entity14 said tuesday			1
" it is not the image of @entity1 that has been undermined , rather it is that of @entity7			1
" @entity7 's announcement came amid speculation that the search giant would pull out of @entity1 entirely			1
in a post on its official blog , @entity7 said it stopped running the censored @entity30 service on monday and was routing its @entity1 users to an uncensored version of @entity7 based in @entity33			1
the special administrative region offers more freedom than mainland @entity1			0
" we want as many people in the world as possible to have access to our services , including users in mainland @entity1 , yet the @entity1 government has been crystal clear throughout our discussions that self - censorship is a non-negotiable legal requirement , " senior vice president @entity36 , @entity7 's chief legal officer , said on the blog			1
@entity7 hopes the move " will meaningfully increase access to information for people in @entity1 , " @entity36 wrote			1
" we very much hope that the @entity1 government respects our decision , though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services , " he added			1
@entity7 said it would monitor whether access to the site is blocked in mainland @entity1			1
early reports from @entity1 suggested that the government was already restricting access to @entity7 's @entity33 - based site , said @entity60 , international affairs director of the @entity61			1
" we 've already heard indications that visitors to @entity66 are getting ' ca n't find page ' errors , " said @entity60 , whose group promotes free speech online			0
the company on monday also launched a dashboard page , which it promises to update daily , that will show which @entity7 services are available in @entity1			1
according to the page , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity7 's @entity74 were blocked monday afternoon			0
observers said @entity7 's actions amount to a withdrawal from @entity1 and highlights expectations that the government will censor search results			1
@entity82 , director of the @entity83 at the @entity85 's @entity84 , which studies the intersection of digital policy and human rights , said @entity7 's move did n't come as a surprise			0
" it 's become unsustainable for @entity7 to operate in this environment , " he said			0
" they 've made a decision that the risks are too great for them , so they 're going to pull out			0
" @entity7 launched @entity30 in 2006			0
that enterprise prompted complaints that the company was sacrificing web freedoms by complying with @entity1 censorship in return for access to a huge market			2
the company , whose slogan is " do n't be evil , " countered that operating in limited form gave @entity1 users more information than than they would have had otherwise			1
@entity7 also hoped its presence would advance online freedom in @entity1			2
in january , @entity7 announced that the company and at least 20 others were victims of a " highly sophisticated and targeted [ hacking ] attack " originating in @entity1 in mid-december , evidently to gain access to the e-mail accounts of @entity1 human rights activists			1
the company said the attacker or attackers gained access to the header -- or subject - line information -- from the e-mails of two human rights activists through the @entity7 network			2
@entity7 - @entity1 move hurts businesses , academics in a speech on internet freedom and security in january , @entity9 secretary of state @entity132 urged @entity1 to investigate such attacks and accusations of government involvement , saying they raised " very serious concerns			2
" @entity1 rejected the claims			0
" accusation that the @entity1 government participated in [ any ] cyber attack , either in an explicit or inexplicit way , is groundless and aims to denigrate @entity1 , " the official @entity142 quoted a spokesman for the @entity144 as saying			2
" we are firmly opposed to that			0
" as a result of the attack , @entity7 said , it was no longer willing to abide by the filters that the @entity1 government demanded			2
briefly afterward , @entity30 was retrieving results for sensitive topics , including the 1989 crackdown at @entity157 , the @entity158 and the banned @entity160 spiritual movement			0
but about a day later , search results appeared to return to normal			0
it 's not just @entity1 -- @entity7 censors results elsewhere , too advocates of @entity166 freedoms cheered @entity7 's move monday			2
" it demonstrates that a company like @entity7 , with the business stakes in a market as large as @entity1 , can make the decision that free and open @entity166 is a better business alternative and a better ethical choice for its users , " @entity60 said			1
internet users gravitate toward sites with unrestricted information , he said			0
" this is an example of how the genie ca n't be put back in the bottle			0
" @entity82 , who co-founded the @entity180 , said @entity1 might go further as a next step : blocking all outside search engines from accessing web information in the country			1
" if such a radical measure happens , that would have major implications for cyberspace as a whole , " he said			0
" it would point to a more regionalized @entity166 " and perhaps embolden countries such as @entity191 to follow suit , @entity82 said			0
@entity30 is the preferred search tool for about 13 percent of @entity1 web users , according to a state - sponsored survey			2
@entity196 , a government - friendly @entity1 search engine , dominates mainland @entity1 with about 77 percent of users , the survey said			2
@entity7 's announcement had been widely anticipated			0
internet companies operating in @entity1 face a march 31 deadline to renew licenses to do business there , according to the @entity205			0
the blog post by @entity36 said @entity7 plans to continue research and development work in @entity1 and to maintain a limited sales presence there			2
in an apparent attempt to protect @entity7 employees in @entity1 , the post said the decision was made by @entity7 's top brass in the @entity9			1
" despite all the uncertainty and difficulties they have faced since we made our announcement in january , [ @entity7 's @entity1 employees ] have continued to focus on serving our @entity1 users and customers , " the blog said			1
" we are immensely proud of them			0
" @entity2 's @entity225 , @entity226 and @entity227 contributed to this report .			0
