@entity0 -- an unlikely sponsor at this year 's annual conservative conference is hoping to not only promote the issues that set it apart from many @entity6 , but also draw attention to the beliefs they share			1
the group is called @entity11 -- a name that combines @entity6 and gay pride			1
so far , the group is getting a mixed response at the @entity16			1
@entity11 was founded by former members of the @entity18 , a gay and lesbian @entity6 grass - roots organization			2
@entity11 has a booth at @entity16 just two spaces away from the exhibition for the @entity24 , which wants the government to define marriage as between a man and a woman			1
the organizations obviously see social issues differently			0
" it 's the ultimate @entity0 power grab to say let 's have a federal constitutional amendment that will federalize the question of marriage , " said @entity11 chairman @entity31			1
through speaking at the event , exhibiting a booth and co-sponsoring the conference , @entity11 hopes to highlight the views it has in common with other @entity6 -- limited government and fiscal responsibility			1
but the members ' nontraditional conservative views are rankling some attendees at @entity16			1
@entity47 , founded by the late rev. @entity48 , boycotted the event after @entity11 was announced as a co-sponsor			1
the younger activists , however , are more accepting			0
about 10,000 people are expect to attend @entity16 , and a conference spokesman said at least 60 percent , and maybe as high as 80 percent , of the attendees are expected to be younger than 30			1
" people in the under 40 age range have become a lot more accepting of homosexuality , " attendee @entity55 said			0
" but i think there 's also more of an attitude among @entity62 that 's sort of more libertarian that says people have the right to do what they want to in their own lives and to take the consequences for it , as well			2
" @entity69 , who is running the booth for the @entity24 , said being two booths away from @entity11 was n't an issue			2
as cameras rolled , he introduced himself to @entity31			0
" i hope we 'll have more time to talk over the next four days			0
maybe we can have a beer later , " @entity69 said			0
" we can have a beer summit later			0
it worked for @entity78 , " @entity31 joked			0
but do n't expect a meeting of the minds			0
" gays and lesbians have the right to live as they choose , but they do n't have the right to redefine marriage for the rest of us , " @entity69 said			0
the organizers of @entity11 will be participating in a roundtable on saturday , but they wo n't be talking about issues that affect gay @entity62			1
instead , they 'll be talking about technology and outreach			2
they say that 's their choice .			2
