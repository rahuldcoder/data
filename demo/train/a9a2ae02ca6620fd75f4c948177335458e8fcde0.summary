@entity0 , @entity1 -- thousands of people joined world leaders in the @entity6 capital monday to remember the night 20 years ago when a euphoric wave of people power swept away the @entity9 and consigned the @entity10 to history			1
in scenes calmly mirroring the events of november 9 , 1989 , crowds thronged through the center of the once - divided city , joining @entity6 chancellor @entity17 in a symbolic re-enactment of the first crossing of the breached @entity20			1
" it was worth fighting for , " @entity17 said , after crossing the @entity22 bridge on @entity23 , the checkpoint where people first poured across the frontier			1
@entity17 , the first former @entity6 to lead the reunified country , was accompanied by @entity30 leader @entity29 and @entity32 ex-president @entity31 as she kicked off events to celebrate the demise of the iconic structure and remember the darker sides of the communist regimes behind it			1
" it is not only a day of celebration for @entity1			1
it is a day of celebration for the whole of @entity43 , " @entity17 said			1
@entity17 was joined by @entity45 's @entity44 , @entity47 's @entity46 and @entity49 president @entity48 in a series of events , including solemn tributes and boisterous music concerts			2
at the climax , a line of 1,000 giant dominoes was knocked over along a 2 - kilometer strip where the @entity20 once stood -- representing the domino effect the structure 's collapse had in ending communism across @entity43			2
memorials were to be held for the 136 lives lost of those who tried to eascape through the barrier that cut @entity0 in two -- many in the so - called " death strip " at the heart of the @entity20 's fortifications			2
read more in our @entity72 special report thousands of people gathered at the @entity74 , the symbol of reunified @entity1 which once stood at the center of the @entity77 between @entity6 and @entity0			1
rock acts including @entity79 joined the festivities , echoing the popular music of the late 80s which soundtracked the cold night when rigid communist control gave way to an exhilarating tide of people clamoring for freedom			0
testament to the powerful legacy of the @entity20 's collapse have been the vivid memories recounted by many of the dramatic and emotional events before and after the fall			0
" it was a circus - like atmosphere , people were enthused and exuberant and thrilled to see the @entity20 coming down , " said @entity94 of @entity95 , who was working for the @entity96 in @entity1 at the time			1
former @entity2 correspondent @entity101 , who watched the @entity20 collapse was struck by the difference in appearance of each side of the @entity20 " on the west side , there was all this graffiti and dirty words , and names of rock groups and ' down with that ' -- all the chaos of a pluralistic society , " he said			0
" on the eastern side , it was clean and white , just so sterile			0
" though dominated by nostalgia , monday was also an opportunity to assess progress in a reunified @entity1 and democratized @entity43 , with many airing concerns that the world still has lessons to learn from the events of 1989			2
with many in @entity1 feeling the economic , social and psychological divisions once demarcated by the @entity20 , @entity17 said monday that the country had yet to fulfil promises made when @entity128 and @entity0 reunited in 1990			1
" @entity1 unity is not yet complete , " @entity17 told public broadcaster @entity129 earlier			1
at an event in @entity0 on sunday , @entity133 secretary of state @entity132 called for renewed global action to liberate those still living under repressive regimes			2
" our history did not end the night the @entity20 came down , " @entity138 said			0
and this matters not only to tens of millions of @entity143 , and to the @entity133 , but to people everywhere			0
" she added : " to expand freedom to more people , we can not accept that freedom does not belong to all people			0
we can not allow oppression , defined and justified by religion or tribe to replace that of ideology			0
" we have a responsibility to address conditions everywhere that undermine the potential of boys and girls and men and women that sap human dignity and threaten global progress			0
" @entity2 's @entity166 contributed to this story			0
