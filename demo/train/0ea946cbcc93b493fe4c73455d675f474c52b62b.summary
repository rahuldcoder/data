@entity0 -- if so - called " smart tvs " are so clever , why do we feel so dense when trying to compare them ? each television manufacturer has its own take on what the software that lets a tv connect to the internet should look like			1
these myriad smart tvs , with their varying degrees of technological intelligence , were on display throughout the @entity14			1
many of the systems developed independently by the various companies look strikingly similar , but offer different features and content			1
most provide access to @entity21 's and @entity23 's streaming video services			2
some , like @entity26 's @entity25 series , have @entity27 for internet radio and @entity29			0
others let you tweet from the tv screen using a keyboard remote			1
@entity35 's new web - connected tv and @entity37 's smart tv platforms can stream video from a computer or from a few smartphone models using a protocol called @entity42			1
setup is n't a cakewalk			0
compounding the confusion is when tv makers put lesser - known services , like @entity48 , @entity49 or @entity50 , front and center			1
to top that off , several major tv manufacturers produce separate models that run completely different platforms			1
@entity58 's @entity57 can access @entity59 and a number of other services			0
but @entity58 's @entity63 sets ca n't get @entity59			0
@entity65 's net tv system can do @entity66 , along with other applications			1
but its @entity69 sets have another set of apps that look and perform differently			0
@entity35 introduced the fourth version of its connected tv platform at @entity14 , and signed partnerships with @entity59 and @entity75			1
@entity35 also announced that it would make a @entity77 tv set and a set - top box , both of which can run @entity75 's software but not @entity59 's			1
" that is different than our smart tv , " @entity35 president @entity83 said in an interview , " but for some consumers who are looking for that solution , we want to be able to serve that			1
" another advantage of having products with @entity77 's software on them : " the brand name means something , " @entity83 said			2
the name @entity77 resonates with certain potential customers that @entity35 may not impact			0
@entity77 and @entity35 partner in various areas , most tightly in mobile			0
@entity35 says it wants to offer a wide array of platforms			2
that 's consistent with how it runs its phone business , building smartphones that use either @entity77 's @entity105 or @entity106 's @entity104			0
" we want to offer choice , " said @entity107 , @entity35 's marketing executive			0
" you wo n't see us choosing one platform over another			0
" but @entity63 is stumbling over obstacles from tv networks that do n't want their internet content available on the big screen			2
add to that , the search - centric software has been plowed by critics for being poorly design			2
perhaps so the company can retool , @entity63 's footprint at @entity14 is small , being showcased sparingly by early partners			1
" being able to use your television set as an internet - search appliance really is n't what people think of when they come to the tv , " @entity126 ceo @entity125 said in an interview			2
" they 're looking for a television experience			0
... that 's something that you have to be very television - focused , very television - centric to deliver			0
" @entity126 's @entity140 box can access some internet services , in addition to recordings			0
several other companies are producing web - connected boxes that can hook up to tvs , but those could be less desirable as new tvs come with @entity149 functions and web features built in			1
@entity77 's inability to find the right formula for tv software , like it did for smartphones with @entity105 , leaves a major opportunity for software makers			1
@entity77 's longtime competitor , @entity158 , makes an operating system for the big screen			0
startups like @entity162 are trying to fill this niche by creating attractive internet software that is provided to manufacturers for free			1
so far , they 've had limited success			0
so unlike the smartphone area , which is dominated by just a few players , there are at least a dozen platforms with different sets of apps , interfaces and features			2
after sales of @entity179 sets grew last year , sales are expected to slow 13 % this year , according to a report by research firm @entity181			0
in addition , smart @entity57 may not prove to be a big selling point			0
@entity35 's @entity83 says less than half of people who buy the company 's internet - enabled tvs actually connect them to the @entity188			2
for @entity35 , standing out in a sea of smart tv platforms could come down to unique methods for connecting its various products together			1
the @entity35 tv platform can run third - party apps , like a smartphone does , and some of them can even interact with a phone			1
for example , there 's a @entity201 app that lets you draw on a @entity204 phone and see your artwork on the big screen			0
" where we think we have a big opportunity going forward is the link between 4 inches , 7 inches and 55 inches , " @entity107 said , referring to the screen sizes of @entity35 's smartphones , tablets and big - screen tv .			2

connected tvs have a major presence at @entity14
the offerings can be confusing since there are so many platforms
several manufacturers produce similar tv models that run completely different software
