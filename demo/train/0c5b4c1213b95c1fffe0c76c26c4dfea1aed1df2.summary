-- the @entity1 kick - started a child sex abuse criminal probe against its former president when it gave @entity4 , @entity5 , police the identities of three of his accusers , a spokesman for the group said sunday			1
@entity11 spoke with @entity0 hours after @entity12 aired , on its show " @entity19 , " interviews with two men who accused @entity16 of abusing them in the 1980s , when he was their coach at a ymca program in the southwest @entity5 city			1
according to @entity21 , the @entity4 police had " no reports from anybody " about @entity16 until the @entity1 -- also known as the @entity1 -- gave them the results of their own , nearly month - long investigation last thursday			1
the group previously claimed that it alerted authorities last friday			2
this included revealing the identity of a " potential third complaining victim " who was not brought up in the @entity12 report , the spokesman said			1
" only the aau 's contact with the @entity4 police triggered what we believe is now a legitimate law enforcement investigation , " said @entity11			1
in the @entity12 report , @entity16 's accusers claim he sexually abused them in hotel rooms during tournaments when they were 12 to 16 years old			1
@entity0 could not reach @entity16 , 63 , who was dismissed from the aau on november 14 , for comment			1
@entity12 said it also had been unable to reach him			1
@entity16 is distinct from the legendary , late former @entity43 football coach who had the same name			1
@entity46 director @entity45 has said that his department is probing the claims			0
" although this case has its challenges due to the amount of time that has passed , it will be thoroughly examined , " @entity45 said			0
" and if the investigation reveals the law was violated , the person responsible will be held accountable			2
" the allegations were made amid child sex scandals at @entity59 and @entity61 universities and @entity62 ; both men accusing @entity16 told @entity12 that the publicity from the scandals prompted them to act			1
@entity59 's @entity66 breaks pelvis in fall detailing its involvement , @entity11 said the @entity1 stands by its response -- including its decision to oust @entity16 , hire an investigator and then contact authorities			1
" these ( @entity1 ) folks dealt with these allegations -- as brief as they were , as anonymous as they were , as salacious as they were , but lacking any specificity , " @entity11 said			0
the aau got " cryptic , brief " e-mails -- signed only as " shrimp breath " -- on november 7 , 8 and 9 -- that " alleged , in a very general way , that @entity82 engaged in child sexual abuse , " said the spokesman			1
and on november 9 , the organization got two brief voice - mails along the same lines			2
there was no name or contact information left in either case			0
those messages were sent to the aau 's compliance and general counsel office , and @entity1 " officers " were notified on november 11			1
the board members , several of whom flew into @entity96 , convened on the following monday , november 14 , " to confront then - president @entity82 , " said @entity11			2
in that meeting , @entity16 claimed he 'd gotten similar phone messages and insisted he was innocent , according to the spokesman , who said he 'd spoken with several @entity1 officers at that meeting			1
" despite those denials , the aau officers directed that @entity82 leave the premises and leave his position ( as president and ceo ) for an indefinite period , " said @entity11			1
under its acting president , @entity110 , the aau hired a private investigator to look into the allegations			0
those findings were turned over to police earlier this month			0
one of @entity16 's accusers , identified by @entity12 as @entity116 of @entity117 , said he was 14 at the time of the alleged abuse			1
@entity116 said he was on a basketball team run by @entity16 , who he said would sometimes slip into @entity116 's hotel room			2
@entity116 said he was talking publicly , despite the potential embarrassment to him and his family , not to " gain anything " but because he felt " the guy should n't be around kids anymore			0
" @entity116 said @entity16 abused him or tried to abuse him six times , including at least once in which he tried " to put his hand in my boxer shorts " while @entity116 was sleeping			2
asked how @entity16 could have entered the hotel room on that and other occasions , @entity116 said , " he had a key			2
he always somehow had a key to whatever room i was in			0
" @entity116 said he tried to find ways to keep @entity16 out of his hotel room when they were at out - of - town basketball tournaments , saying he was " afraid to even fall asleep			2
" " he would push his way in the room and then end up , i 'd see , i would n't see him , i would hear him , he 'd lay at the floor of the bed masturbating , " the man said			0
" and you just lay there horrified			0
but you do n't know what to do			0
what , are you going to blow the lid off of this at 14 years ? all you want to do is pretend it did n't happen and not address it at all			0
you want to hide and bury it			0
" another accuser , whom @entity12 did not identify , said @entity16 gave him alcohol before taking him to a bedroom and touching him inappropriately			1
" the last thing that i can really remember was him carrying me into his bedroom and i can remember him , you know , touching me in ways that i , i did n't uh , i did n't want another man touching me , " the man said			0
that accuser said he called @entity82 on november 11 and confronted him			0
@entity16 , he said , then apologized for the alleged abuse			1
the network said it examined the man 's phone records and verified an eight - minute phone call to @entity16 's number			2
both men said they had never reported the alleged incidents to police and had only recently told their families , @entity12 said			1
@entity11 criticized the half - hour @entity12 report for not quoting @entity110 's video statement on the matter or others from the aau			1
the organization , which has 80,000 adult volunteers involved in coaching and works with hundreds of thousands of young people , is asking outside experts to review its policies for protecting children , which @entity11 called the aau 's " no. 1 priority			0
" the spokesman also clarified that @entity16 told his successor , @entity110 , that he had colon cancer and needed surgery after his november 14 dismissal			1
@entity16 allegedly asked that he be able to retire for medical purposes -- a request that @entity110 denied , according to @entity21			2
" ( @entity110 ) told mr. @entity16 to go focus on your health , go through this surgery and we 'll deal with this issue later , " said @entity11			2
@entity16 has been back at the aau 's offices one time since his ouster , contrary to the organization 's earlier reports that he 'd never returned			1
the occasion was a " forensic audit " that the spokesman called " standard " for outgoing leaders of organizations			0
" @entity82 is no longer part of the @entity1 , " said @entity11			0
" he has no continuing role ( or ) involvement in their programs			0
there 's no contact with him			0
whatever compensation he would have been entitled to -- accrued vacation time -- will be paid , and that 's it			0
