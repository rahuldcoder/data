the four finalists all threw perfect games in " @entity8 " during the qualifying month , but @entity14 and the other three were the most perfect			1
@entity25 , the publisher of the game , said they verified more than 2,500 perfect games and used an algorithm to rank perfect games based on degree of difficulty and perfection			1
a perfect game is one in which a winning pitcher records at least 27 consecutive outs -- a full nine innings -- without allowing a runner on base			2
' @entity41 ' , @entity42 and the quest for the perfect game @entity14 said he played the game for about 30 days before finally getting a perfect game that qualified him for the playoffs			1
his basic strategy , he said , was to use " the best ( available ) pitcher against the worst team			2
" @entity14 got his perfect game with pitcher @entity52 of the light - hitting @entity53			1
the real @entity52 has never had a perfect game or even a no - hitter in his major league career			2
he is 42 - 35 in his sixth year in the big leagues			0
@entity14 , who was a pitcher in high school and for one year in college , said having a pitcher 's mentality helped him devise a game plan against the batters			1
he also thinks having that mind - set gave him an edge as his perfect game reached the later innings			2

" it is a video game , so you do n't have to be a star athlete or a pitcher in the @entity8			1

" @entity8 pitcher battles cancer , never quits for the tournament , @entity14 chose the @entity82 as his team , despite the fact he says he 's a lifetime @entity87 fan			1
he said the @entity82 " had a pretty strong lineup for the past couple of years and i felt comfortable with what they gave me			1
" " they 've got guys who can hit home runs against lefties and righties , " he said			0
" their pitching is not bad			0
" after demolishing his opening - round opponent by a 9 - 3 score , @entity14 was matched up in the final against @entity101 of @entity102 , @entity103			1
@entity101 used the @entity104 's in his attempt to win the prize , but @entity14 's @entity82 were too much			1
" i hit a two - run home run in the first inning			0
that was a lot of pressure gone and i did n't have to worry about it as much ( after that ) , " he said			0
@entity14 added another home run later in the game , and his pitching kept @entity101 's @entity104 's off balance as he won 3 - 1			2
@entity14 , a student at the @entity117 , said most of his winnings will go toward tuition and other related expenses			2
but he added , " i plan to spoil myself a little bit and my dad and some other family members			0
