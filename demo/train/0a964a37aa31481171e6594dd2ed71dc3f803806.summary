a " big f * * * ing deal " has become an equally big fight , with @entity1 relentlessly attacking president @entity3 's signature health care reforms over the new reality they are bringing to the health insurance market			1
one reason is the @entity1 's ideological opposition to big government , as manifested by the health care overhaul intended to hold down rising costs that threaten @entity14 fiscal stability			1
another is the long - term political benefit to @entity3 and @entity17 from the sweeping changes intended to give people previously unable to afford health insurance or deemed ineligible the chance to obtain coverage			1
coupled with @entity3 's stated second - term priority -- proposed immigration reform that would remove the " illegal " label for millions of undocumented aliens -- the legislative power play could provide an electoral boost for @entity17 certain to last a generation or longer			1
the combination of @entity31 -- as the @entity32 is known -- and immigration reform " would be a huge boon to the @entity17 , " said @entity35 , the @entity36 's vice president and director of governance studies			1
" it would provide insurance to millions who do n't currently have it , and it brings aboard undocumented people who are very likely to be @entity17 supporters , " he told @entity38			1
@entity44 , a political science professor at @entity46 , said such an outcome is the goal of all presidents and their congressional allies who seek to " enact policies that will hold their base and attract new voters in successive election cycles			0
" @entity1 know that , which explains their fierce opposition to @entity31 dating back to well before vice president @entity59 's off - color description whispered too loudly to @entity3 as the president prepared to sign the law in 2010			1
now a confluence of factors -- including the overall impact of the reforms as well as major problems in their implementation and continued @entity1 efforts to derail them -- have further hardened already entrenched partisan positions on the issue			1
what 's up with @entity31 and my health care ? effects of @entity31 it has taken more than three years since the @entity76 became law to begin to understand its effects			1
the concept leans heavily on a conservative @entity1 idea adopted for the @entity83 state health care program that creates large markets to hold down prices			1
to work , the program must include less - expensive young people to offset the higher costs of older people , who generally need more health care			1
such a system would provoke competition between insurers for lucrative markets , meaning lower premiums and a minimum standard of benefits to provide security against financial ruin over a major illness or bad accident			0
however , an analysis by @entity38 found that consumer options vary significantly from state to state , and many @entity14 are discovering they have few options			0
for example , @entity107 and @entity108 have one insurance company offering coverage , meaning no choice between providers , while eight other states -- @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 -- have two			0
the @entity123 estimates that 12 million people live in counties with only one insurer , compared with 117 million in counties with more than five insurers			0
the foundation 's @entity129 found that in counties with more than five insurers , the average premium was about $ 20 a month less than in areas with only one insurer			0
in addition , @entity38 's @entity133 reported thursday that in some cases , the same company will charge more for a policy in a rural area , compared with a big city			2
the differences generally reflect the smaller pool of consumers in less populous rural areas , compared with more densely populated urban and suburban areas			0
such disparities also tend to follow a political fault line in many places , with @entity17 more prevalent in big cities and suburbs , while @entity1 generally get more support in rural areas			1
while definitive correlations would be overly simplistic and premature , increased options in urban areas versus rural areas indicate that on a broad level , more democrats than @entity1 are realizing benefits from @entity31 so far in terms of choice and cost			1
to @entity161 , a @entity162 professor who helped design the @entity83 and federal health care laws , it is too early to understand the full effects of @entity31			1
" it 's not like @entity31 's chasing insurers out " of rural areas , @entity161 told @entity38 on thursday			0
" these are just markets that did n't have many insurers to choose from before , and there has n't been a lot of entry in the recent times since the law has passed			2
" in @entity83 , he said , a major new provider entered the market two years after the reforms took effect			2
" you do n't need 16 choices			0
you do n't need 12 choices , " @entity161 said			0
" it 's nice to have that many , but having one or two new entrants , which will happen over time -- it did in @entity83 -- can really shake up the market in lower prices			0
" @entity1 on insurance cancellations : ' we told you so ' botched website rollout conservative critics long warned that @entity31 amounted to a government takeover of health care that would be too big to manage effectively and deny people the ability to choose their own doctor or coverage			1
so far , some of the predictions have proved true			0
while initial stages of implementation proved relatively uneventful , the biggest single step -- the october 1 launch of exchanges to give people the chance to buy required health coverage -- was badly botched when the government website proved dysfunctional			1
the administration scrambled to try to get it working , announcing a " tech surge " with outside experts deployed to bolster the joint government - private sector team that created @entity218			0
in addition , insurers recently began informing some of the relatively small percentage of people who buy their own health coverage , instead of getting it through their employer or government - run @entity226 , that their policies were being discontinued or changed because they failed to comply with @entity31 requirements			2
the shift undermined @entity3 's mantra - like pledge in selling the reforms that no one would be forced to change policies or doctors they liked			2
@entity3 " has broken many promises about @entity31 , " @entity239 chairman @entity238 said in a prepared statement friday that solicited stories from people about how they were hurt by @entity31			0
on monday , the @entity239 announced it was launching a campaign of robocalls and targeted @entity248 posts to encourage people to ask why their elected representatives supported what it called " @entity3 's lie that people could keep their healthcare plans under @entity76			0
" at the @entity257 on friday , spokesman @entity256 emphasized that the individual policies being discontinued or changed represented a fraction of the overall @entity14 population			0
he reiterated the administration line that consumers would get a better deal under @entity31 -- more benefits at what likely will be a lower price than they pay now if they qualify for federal subsidies available under the reforms			2
for many , @entity3 's promise of health care choice does not ring true early figures the latest battle line between the parties is about early enrollment figures			1
@entity1 are pushing the administration to release numbers for how many signed up in the first month of the new exchanges , but @entity256 and others say complete and reliable information will only be available by mid-november			1
rep. @entity281 of @entity282 , the @entity1 chairman of the @entity284 , has threatened to subpoena information on enrollment figures as soon as this week			1
@entity256 and other officials have said they expect the initial figures to be low , because of the website problems and a cautious approach by consumers in the early days of such programs			2
he and others note that the @entity83 health care plan had most people sign up in the final days before the enrollment deadline , and they expect the same thing to happen with the federal program			1
that deadline is march 31			0
@entity161 of @entity162 called the focus on the early figures premature			2
" according to the @entity302 , it will be about a three - year ramp - up period until @entity31 is fully effective at its full level of functioning , " he said			0
' " that 's what we saw in @entity83 as well			0
so we need to just calm down and stop worrying about days and weeks and focus instead on months and years			2
" however , @entity161 warned that the @entity218 website must be fully operational by the end of november to ensure that people being forced to change policies have time to enroll by january 1 , when their current coverage ends			2
the @entity1 goal in demanding the figures is to depict @entity31 as an immediate failure in order to try to generate public momentum for delaying or dismantling the law			1
some democrats facing tough re-election battles next year also have proposed a delay to allow people more time to sign up and avoid the fine , but the @entity3 administration opposes such a step because it would undermine the immediate creation of large new markets needed to keep costs down			0
5 things we learned from @entity31 hearing the immigration connection even if @entity31 works as planned , @entity161 told @entity38 , about 40 % of people currently uninsured would remain without coverage			0
as many as a half of that group -- 10 million or so -- would be undocumented immigrants living illegally in the country , he said			0
" today , these undocumented immigrants end up in the emergency room			0
next year , they 'll end up in the emergency room again , " he said			0
" that may be something we want to take on eventually as a society , but we do n't seem prepared to do so now			0
" to @entity35 of the @entity36 , the @entity31 and immigration issues " do intersect in interesting ways			0
" he noted the @entity76 specifically excludes undocumented immigrants from getting health insurance under the reforms			1
a @entity350 - passed immigration reform proposal would give temporary legal status to the undocumented , but make them wait 10 years before they could seek citizenship			1
it is unclear if the plan will get a vote in the @entity1 - led @entity257			2
the decade of waiting to seek citizenship should ease the fears of @entity1 over an immediate impact on elections , as only @entity14 citizens can vote , @entity35 said			2
however , any undocumented immigrants who eventually become citizens would probably be @entity17 , because " they 've seen @entity17 have been the people pushing for immigration reform while @entity1 have been resistant , " he added			1
@entity44 , the @entity46 political science professor , said the issue of @entity31 eligibility could be a sticking point in the immigration reform debate , adding : " republicans will absolutely insist that ( undocumented immigrants ) are not eligible for @entity31 during that 10 - year - period " before they can seek citizenship .			1

*obamacare* and immigration reform could boost @entity17 for a generation or more
parties in power always try to use policy to secure future voter support
ideology aside , @entity1 know health care , immigration reforms help @entity17
@entity1 attacks focus on the health care law , not just website woes
