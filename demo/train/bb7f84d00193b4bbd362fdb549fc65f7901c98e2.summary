-- @entity1 is barring anyone deemed worthy of a pair of its $ 1,500 @entity5 computer eyewear from selling or even loaning out the highly coveted gadget			1
the company 's terms of service on the limited - edition wearable computer specifically states , " you may not resell , loan , transfer , or give your device to any other person			1
if you resell , loan , transfer , or give your device to any other person without @entity1 's authorization , @entity1 reserves the right to deactivate the device , and neither you nor the unauthorized person using the device will be entitled to any refund , product support , or product warranty			1
" welcome to the @entity28 , one in which companies are retaining control of their products even after consumers purchase them			0
it was bound to happen			0
strange as it may sound , you do n't actually own much of the software you buy today			0
you essentially rent it under strict end - user agreements that have withstood judicial scrutiny			0
@entity1 appears to be among the first to apply such draconian rules to consumer electronics			1
" if it takes off like @entity47 did , this is going to be part of people 's everyday activity , and now we are starting down this path that is going to be completely controlled , " said @entity42 , the @entity44 's intellectual property coordinator			0
" it 's not clear to me what they are doing is unlawful			0
it 's a contract issue			0
" the company knows if the eyewear was transferred because each device is registered under the buyer 's @entity1 account			1
for the moment , not just anybody can buy the eyewear			2
@entity1 has created the @entity66 equivalent of a velvet rope under its so - called @entity68			1
if @entity1 liked what you posted on social media under the hashtag # ifihadglassand , @entity1 grants you the opportunity to fork out $ 1,500 for the @entity75 edition of the headset			1
@entity1 also is n't saying when it would lift its velvet rope and whether the same draconian terms of service would apply when it does lift the velvet rope			2
@entity1 's tight rein over the gadget came to light today when one of the first would - be owners of the device abruptly halted an @entity88 auction because he feared reprisals from @entity1			1
" after getting a message on @entity94 from @entity1 saying i had been selected as part of the program a couple weeks ago , it just came to mind if they are giving out to a limited number of people , i could put it out there on @entity88 and sell it for a lot more than $ 1,500 , " said @entity90 , a @entity91 man who halted his auction wednesday			1
( @entity0 agreed not to publish his last name as a condition of him telling his story			0
) because the only correspondence @entity90 has had with @entity1 is the initial tweet about his acceptance into the program , he had no idea he was n't allowed to sell his @entity5 , which he had been authorized to purchase for $ 1,500 in the coming weeks			1
instead , he found out via the @entity112			0
he also discovered that some were upset that he had the audacity to sell his @entity5 headset			2
" people were acting like i had did something sacrilegious , " he said			0
once @entity90 learned of the terms of service , he ended the auction â € ” which began at $ 5,000 and ballooned to more than $ 90,000			1
no one from @entity1 or @entity88 had contacted him about the auction , he said			1
he still wants his @entity75 headset and hopes that @entity1 does n't hold it against him for trying to sell the device			1
" i 'm willing to fork up the $ 1,500 for it , " he said			1
the tech world , including @entity1 , won an approval - of - sorts to control its stream of commerce in 2010 , when the 9th @entity131 said licensing language controls resales			2
the case concerned a dispute about whether a @entity137 man could resell @entity139 software on @entity88			2
@entity139 prevailed in a lawsuit , and the @entity142 - based appeals court pointed out that the shrink - wrap agreement between its customers forbade the resale of it			0
the @entity147 , whose members include @entity1 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 and dozens of others , urged the court to rule as it did			2
the @entity155 also sided with @entity139			0
federal regulators cited that decision last year (			0
pdf ) when it blocked mobile - phone owners from lawfully unlocking their phones to run on a compatible carrier of choice , saying the ruling was " controlling precedent			0
" that 's because people do n't own the software on their phones that controls access to carrier networks , regulators said			0
for @entity90 , it 's all a lost opportunity to cash in on being one of the first selected to buy @entity5			2
it would have been " exciting , " he said , " to get $ 100,000 for something that only costs $ 1,500			1
