@entity0 , @entity1 -- a group of women basketball players in @entity1 has been defying stereotypes as one of the few female sports teams in the kingdom			1
@entity1 practices an austere form of @entity10 in which women are forbidden from playing sport in public -- as well as driving , or traveling without the permission of a male guardian			1
but @entity16 , which has grown its membership over the past decade from a dozen to 350 , mostly children of both genders , works around these restrictions by playing and practicing on a gender - segregated private court			1
conservative clerics in @entity1 have argued there are religious reasons for excluding women from sport			1
sheikh @entity28 , who preaches in the holy city of @entity30 , told @entity2 that form - fitting athletic clothing was immoral , and that women should be veiled and remain at home			2
but the female athletes of @entity16 , based in @entity1 's second - largest city , say that , although sport remains a minority pursuit among women in their country , attitudes are slowly changing			1

" today , there 's more acceptance			0
there 's a lot more companies willing to support us			0
so , i really think as a society we are evolving			0
" perhaps the biggest symbol of this shift was @entity1 's announcement last month that it would allow female athletes to compete at the @entity58 for the first time at the @entity60			1
previously , the kingdom has been one of only three countries -- along with @entity64 and @entity65 -- that banned women from competing			2
all have now dropped the policy			0
see also : @entity65 's first female olympians yet no female athletes have been identified so far to represent @entity1 in @entity71 , and if women are sent to compete , they will still face restrictions			1
women athletes must have their male guardian 's permission and be accompanied by him to all events , wear appropriate @entity10 dress , and refrain from mixing with men during the event			1
@entity16 's @entity81 , 18 , dreams of someday competing at the @entity58 , but said : " the society is still not accepting of @entity1 women playing sports			1
" but @entity85 says attitudes towards female athletes are changing , and much of the reason is growing public awareness of the health benefits of sport			1
basketball helped her overcome post-partum depression following the birth of her first child			2
" i felt like i needed something to get better , " she said			0
others in the team had played basketball to help them in their battle with eating and body - image disorders			2
" it really helped all these women			2
they went back to their normal lifestyle , " @entity85 said			0
" we just looked at it as something not just from an entertainment point of view			0
it 's bigger than that			0
" while the women still receive criticism from conservatives , it does not deter them from taking to the court			2
" we 're having fun , we 're all girls			0
we 're doing something that 's healthy for our bodies and our minds , " said 24 - year - old @entity120			0
@entity85 said she hoped the team 's example would help encourage public debate about women in sport , and demonstrate to " the opposing segments in society that we 're not going against our religious or cultural beliefs			1
" " at the end of the day , we 're all law - abiding citizens who want to develop our youth , " she said			0
" we do n't want them to get into smoking and drugs and wasting their time			0
