-- if volunteer work is a requirement , is it really volunteer ? of course not			0
but that did n't stop @entity8 state sen. @entity7 from writing a bill that would require certain welfare recipients to do community service in order to receive public assistance			1
" the whole intention is to make certain folks have some skin in the game , and i do n't feel that there 's any problem with making folks go out and do some kind of community service in order to receive their cash assistance , " @entity7 said			1
now as a former welfare recipient , i do n't have a problem with expecting people to work to earn money			1
but where i come from we call that a job , not volunteerism			2
@entity34 ' bill bastardizes the word while positioning those who challenge it as pro-moocher			2
it 's a political parlor trick designed to fire up the kind of voters who saw nothing wrong with @entity45 's infamous statement that 47 % of @entity46 are basically freeloaders			0
and it reeks of the @entity51 @entity50 worldview that characterizes welfare recipients as parasites or inner - city welfare queens who vote @entity56 -- even though seven of the 10 states the @entity46 @entity58 reports rely the most on food stamps have @entity50 governors			1
the same misdirection applies to the sister bill @entity7 wrote , which requires drug testing			1
reports such as the @entity66 and @entity67 suggest drug abuse among welfare recipients is hardly widespread			1
many states have tried drug testing for welfare recipients with practically nobody testing positive			1
in @entity75 , for example , in 2012 , after three years and 87,000 screenings , one person had failed a drug test			2
@entity78 's drug screening program spent $ 30,000 on testing and only 2.5 % of recipients turned out positive for illicit drugs			1
@entity83 's program had the same results			0
in all cases , the testing -- which assumes all welfare recipients are druggies -- cost much more than the savings in welfare payments			1
and the @entity58 found fraud -- selling food stamps illegally -- accounts for a little more than 1 % of all food stamp spending nationally			0
but that does n't matter			0
arguing against testing makes it appear as if you 're pro-illicit drug use			2
are there people who abuse the system ? yes			2
and growing up i saw them around me			0
as @entity104 once suggested , the safety net can become " a hammock that lulls able - bodied people into lives of dependency and complacency			0
" but it was my experience that people who were working but could n't make ends meet far outnumbered the abusers			1
this is what happens when inflation outpaces wage growth for the better part of 40 years			0
the richest 20 % of working families took home nearly half -- 48 % -- of the income in 2011			0
the bottom 20 % only took in 5 %			0
these are the sort of details these faux fiscal hawks rarely , if ever , bring up			0
which makes today 's demonization and humiliation of poor people even more unethical than when @entity51 did it			1
this characterization of poor people as lazy drug abusers is often cast in the narrative of @entity56 representing urban areas with large minority populations fighting @entity50 from predominantly white regions			1
it 's impossible to ignore a racial component here that neither party should foster			0
there are ways to put people in a position to earn the aid they receive without trying to rebrand exploitation as volunteerism			1
for example , establish a program similar to the work - study on college campuses , in which qualified people could have access to jobs designated specifically for them			0
transportation for @entity46 reported that more than 13 % of @entity8 bridges are considered structurally deficient , nearly 40 % of the roads are in poor or mediocre condition and 161 dams have been classified as " high hazard			1
" there is work the state needs done , and not all of it requires a degree in civil engineering			0
more important , polls indicate @entity8 voters at least are willing to support a tax increase to address some of the state 's infrastructure needs			2
if politicians are committed to helping people who are struggling financially but want to discourage sloth , there are creative ways to do that without demonizing the folks who are struggling			1
but let 's not pretend that work in exchange for money is anything other than a employer - employee relationship			0
to do otherwise is dehumanizing			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			2

@entity8 bill would require some welfare recipients to do community service
@entity189 says working for money is a job , not volunteerism
@entity199 : second bill requires drug testing , even though few recipients abuse drugs
@entity199 : creative ways exist to earn aid that do n't exploit or demonize poor people
