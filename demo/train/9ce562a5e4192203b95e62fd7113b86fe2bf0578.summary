-- there are many reasons why @entity3 is an extraordinary woman -- she has rowed single - handed across the @entity4 and is now tackling the @entity5 , after all			1
life changer : from successful career to ocean rower , @entity3 has been an inspiration for many			1
but her response to everyday commuter ennui is perhaps of the most remarkable things about her			2
back in 2000 a 33 - year - old @entity3 was facing another dreary journey by train to the office			0
she had a great job as a management consultant , money and a husband ; but deep down she knew something was missing			0
so , instead of just burying her feelings , she wrote two obituaries of herself			0
in one she kept going with life as it was			1
in the other she took a jump into the unknown and did the things she 'd always wanted to			0
from that moment on her life has never been the same			1
" one - by - one , i shed the trappings of my old life , " she writes on her web site			1
" the job , the husband , the home , the little red sports car			0
i moved house with increasing regularity , wherever i could find cheap or preferably free accommodation			0
" little by little i began to realign my life , to put myself on track for the obituary i really wanted			1
" eventually she settled on the challenge that would in many ways define her : rowing the @entity4 single handed			1
it was , of course , incredibly hard , both physically and mentally			0
she had done some rowing while at the @entity48 -- but the open ocean was a different challenge altogether			0
but she emerged a tougher , happier person on the other side , and is now deep into her new attempt to row the @entity5 , a journey she hopes to use to raise awareness of environmental issues			1
the courage she has found , both to take on the might of the open ocean and give up safe , conventional notions of success to pursue her dreams has made @entity3 a hero to many people that hope to find inspiration in her life -- including a large number of @entity0 readers who have nominated her as a " @entity70 "			1
" i feel a little embarrassed about it -- that must be the @entity74 in me ! " she told @entity0 from the middle of the @entity5			1
" i certainly do n't see myself as any kind of hero , just a human being trying to be the best human she can be			1
but at the same time i want to reach out to as many people as i can , because i wish i 'd had more positive role models to show me how good life can be , and if i can inspire just a few people to change their lives for the better , i 'll feel i 've lived a very blessed life			1
" rowing across the @entity5 on her journey she keeps the many people following her up to date with regular blog posts on her website			1
posts range from the personal to the global , the reality of life on the open waves to plastic pollution , the @entity90 , and how people could reduce the amount of waste they generate			1
" i try to offer my life as an example of what can be done when a very ordinary person decides to do something out of the ordinary , " she said			1
" i love my life , and want to show people how much fun it can be when you get out there and grab life by the horns			1
it would be very selfish of me to keep this fantastic discovery to myself ! " every time i get a comment on my blog from someone who says they have changed their life as a result of reading about me and my adventures -- anything from composting their kitchen scraps to quitting their job to start out on an adventure of their own -- it gives me a huge warm glow of accomplishment			1
and it makes me feel even better when they tell me how much fun they are having doing it			0
because that is what life is all about			1
" but adventure does n't have to involve months alone in a rowing boat , with only sea birds , the sun and the wind for company			2
" everybody is different , and will find their own way , " she said			0
" for me , at the time when i decided to row oceans , i felt the need for a dramatic contrast to the very conventional life i 'd had before , and ocean rowing seemed to fit the bill			2
i do think that you learn things about yourself in extreme situations that you would n't learn in less testing circumstances			2
" but the situation does n't have to be physically extreme			2
parenthood , starting a new business , moving to a new town or a new country -- these are all ways to put yourself in a challenging new environment where you have to throw away your old preconceptions about what is or is not possible , and try out new approaches			0
" ever action has an effect @entity3 's advice for anyone stuck in a rut is do n't be afraid to fail			2
if you know what you want to do , then do n't be intimidated			2
write a list of what you can do to achieve your goals			0
if there seems to be things on it you ca n't do yet , then @entity3 says it is n't detailed enough -- any task can be broken down into achievable steps			2
" everything is a learning experience if you allow it to be			0
i keep a journal -- on land and at sea -- and this really helps me to learn from my experiences , " she said			0
at the core of her mission in the @entity5 is a belief that we can not only transform our own lives through our actions , but our relationship to the natural world around us as well			1
" there has been so much bad news about environmental issues that i think some people feel overwhelmed , " she said			0
" but there is something we can all do to make a difference -- and it all adds up			0
" it 's about more than just using a re-usable bag , or picking up a piece of trash from a beach			0
it 's about an attitude and a way of thinking			0
" every action has effects beyond the action itself -- other people will see what you are doing and follow your example			0
it 's the ripple effect			0
and if we all pull together , we can make a world of difference			2
" fundamentally , her message is that life is for living and we learn as much from failure as success if we are open - minded and positive			1
" my life now is so much more fulfilling and fun , and i 'm incredibly glad i took that leap of faith			2
there is nothing special about me that made me able to do it			0
if i can do it , anybody can -- if they want to			0
" get out there , live life large , make the world a better place -- and have fun ! " send us an email and tell us who you think deserves to be recognized as a @entity70			1
