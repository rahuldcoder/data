@entity0 -- the @entity2 must transform how it protects its soldiers , collects information about internal threats and communicates with the @entity6 and terrorism experts in an effort to prevent another incident like last year 's shootings at @entity11 in @entity12 , a report by the @entity2 and the @entity14 says			1
the report , released tuesday , says a remedy will be more @entity2 participation in the @entity18 , teams of experts drawn from law enforcement and intelligence agencies			1
it also recommends that @entity2 agents within the @entity6 headquarters work as part of the threat management unit			2
the report highlights a failure to share information inside the @entity2 and to encourage anyone , without fear of punishment , to voice suspicions about others in the military			1
" the focus of the findings and recommendations in the @entity42 area was the lack of policy , procedures and systems for the sharing of threat related information between the @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity14 and other federal agencies such as the @entity6 , " the report said			2
the @entity2 report is 118 pages and titled " @entity54 : @entity55			1
" the @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 released separate reports			0
maj. @entity62 , a @entity2 psychiatrist and @entity64 - born @entity63 , is accused of the november 5 , 2009 , shootings , in which 13 people were killed and dozens wounded			1
an evidentiary hearing is set to resume on monday , a step toward the military decision on whether @entity62 will face a court - martial and a possible death penalty			0
after the shootings there were numerous reports of @entity62 's outspoken opposition to the @entity64 wars in @entity75 and @entity76 and to muslims killing @entity63			0
@entity62 was days away from shipping out to @entity76 at the time of the shootings			0
also , @entity62 reportedly had communicated by e-mail with radical @entity83 cleric @entity82 , something @entity64 government agencies apparently knew about but did not tell the military			0
army secretary @entity85 and gen. @entity86 , chief of staff of the @entity2 , were at @entity11 on friday to mark the first anniversary of the shootings			2
@entity85 was asked whether the @entity2 had done enough to respond to warning signals about @entity62			2
he said the @entity2 is " looking at the final parts of assessing exactly what was known , what officers and soldiers knew about that particular individual and what was done , if anything , to react to it			1
" the @entity2 report says no single action would have prevented @entity11			1
" however , in the aggregate , the initiatives outlined by the @entity2 's internal review team will significantly improve the @entity2 's ability to mitigate internal threats , ensure @entity106 [ force protection ] , enable emergency response and provide care for the victims and families			0
" the report says the @entity2 needs to create a kind of " neighborhood watch " program that will teach members of the @entity2 community to recognize and report suspicious behavior			1
the report acknowledges that members of @entity120 continue to press the @entity14 and @entity64 intelligence agencies for what they knew about @entity62			0
" much of the information requested has not been released because it would compromise the trial of the alleged perpetrator , " the report says			0
the @entity2 says it already has implemented changes , including having first responders move in quickly to respond to a shooting rather than cordoning it off and awaiting special teams			1
some of the recommendations were general and some were very specific			0
the @entity2 is still working on ways to identify what it calls " observable indicators for espionage , terrorism and extremism , " according to the report			2
another recommendation says , " [ @entity142 ] are now authorized to use jacketed hollow point ammunition to reduce the risk of injury to innocent bystanders			0

@entity2 report : methods for protecting soldiers , collecting intelligence need *overhaul*
@entity2 participation in @entity18 is one remedy , report says
report cites failure to share information and encourage people to come *forward*
@entity2 says some changes have already been implemented
