-- nearly two years after it was sent up to the @entity2 , a giant particle physics detector has provided its first results in the search for the mysterious " dark matter " believed to be a major component of the universe			1
the international team running the @entity10 released its initial findings wednesday at the @entity12 , known as @entity12 , in @entity13			2
the scientists are studying flux in cosmic rays , the charged high - energy particles that permeate space , for evidence of the invisible dark matter particles colliding with each other , leading to what is termed " annihilation			1
" a result of this would be a higher presence of the charged particles known as positrons , the antimatter counterpart of electrons			0
according to a @entity12 statement , the results announced wednesday " are consistent with the positrons originating from the annihilation of dark matter particles in space , but not yet sufficiently conclusive to rule out other explanations			1
" how particle smasher and telescopes relate over the last few decades , scientists have come to the conclusion that the universe 's composition is only about 5 % atoms -- in other words , the stuff that we see and know around us			2
that means the rest is stuff we ca n't see			0
about 71 % is something called " dark energy , " and another 24 % is " dark matter			1
" research is ongoing to figure out precisely what these " dark " components are , because they do not interact with ordinary matter and have never been directly detected			0
the @entity10 project is being jointly run by scientists from 16 countries , under the leadership of prof. @entity63 of the @entity64			2
the cosmic ray particle physics detector was carried to the @entity2 on the final flight of the space shuttle @entity68 and installed under @entity70 direction			1
since may 2011 , the detector -- which is mounted outside the space station -- has been sifting through matter , antimatter and other particles as it circles the @entity76 , with the data sent to hundreds of scientists on the ground for analysis			1
their initial conclusions are based on some 25 billion recorded events over the course of 18 months			0
" as the most precise measurement of the cosmic ray positron flux to date , these results show clearly the power and capabilities of the @entity10 detector , " @entity63 said , according to the @entity12 statement			1
" over the coming months , @entity10 will be able to tell us conclusively whether these positrons are a signal for dark matter , or whether they have some other origin			1
" opinion : how the @entity98 can lead us to the dark universe physicist @entity100 , a senior research associate at @entity101 , told @entity0 the results from the @entity10 are significant because they 've " thrown up a question which may have an answer in dark matter			1
" dark matter remains a mystery because there has been no direct observation of it , he explained			1
" we are fairly happy that it exists , we are fairly happy about the kind of shape -- that it envelops galaxies and is much wider than the galaxies themselves , " he said			0
" but what we do n't know yet is what it 's made of -- and that is hampered by the fact that we can not see it and can not detect it , " he said , because the detectors are made to measure matter as we know it			0
" in this case , it will always be an open question until we can pin down what dark matter is made of , " he said			2
the scientists involved in the project say the results coming from the spectrometer -- which are much more accurate than in past experiments -- are consistent with a fairly basic dark matter model , @entity100 said			1
at the same time , they are right to be hesitant about rushing to make claims that might later prove to be unsubstantiated , he added			0
the state - of - the art detector , which weighs 8,500 kilograms , is expected to stay in operation through the lifetime of the space station , until 2020 or longer			0
the results " could help foster a new understanding of the fields of fundamental physics and astrophysics , " @entity70 administrator @entity142 said in a statement wednesday			0
" i am confident that this is only the first of many scientific discoveries enabled by the station that will change our understanding of the universe , " he said			0
@entity12 director general @entity155 said the findings so far were " a great example of the complementarity of experiments on @entity76 and in space			0
" searches for dark matter are also being carried out at @entity12 using the @entity163 , the world 's largest and most powerful particle accelerator , and other laboratories			2
" working in tandem , i think we can be confident of a resolution to the dark matter enigma sometime in the next few years , " @entity155 said			2
better ' baby picture ' of the universe emerges @entity0 's @entity173 contributed to this report .			0

scientists have been analyzing data from the @entity10
they are seeking evidence of " dark matter " particles thought to be part of the universe
@entity10 is mounted outside the @entity2
it gives the " most precise measurement of the cosmic ray positron flux to date "
