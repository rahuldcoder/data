before @entity2 was out and proud and dancing every day on her talk show , when heterosexual male actors would n't dare to play gay , and violence against gay people was the talking point of the day for @entity11 activists , there was transgender activist @entity12			1
it 's hard to find @entity12 's 1993 classic novel , " @entity14 , " today			1
the novel 's protagonist starts out as a girl and moves through the identities of being lesbian , butch and a man in the 1960s and 1970s			0
" you 're more than just neither , honey , " @entity12 wrote in " @entity14			1
" " there 's other ways to be than either - or			0
it 's not so simple			0
otherwise there would n't be so many people who do n't fit			2
" like the customers who had enough of police brutality and rioted at @entity33 's @entity32 in 1969 and energized a movement , there was no closet big enough to hold @entity12 , who passed away november 15 at age 65			1
@entity12 died at home in @entity38 , @entity33 , from complications from several infections , her spouse of 22 years , @entity41 , told the advocate			1
she was working on the 20th anniversary edition of " @entity14 " when she died			1
when i first read her book , the landscape for lgbt rights was very different			0
for a 20 - something like me coming out in the early 1990s , there was nothing trendy or cool about being out			0
forget ever getting married : there was no law that protected me from being fired or attacked because of my identity			0
i did n't " look " gay so i could hide , as i had through my teen years and most of my undergraduate education			0
i could quietly enjoy the benefits of the work done by @entity12 and other transgender activists , butch women , gay men and drag queens who could not or would not fade into the shadows			1
@entity12 and the other people who would not be silent taught me that was not a way to live , to truly live , standing on the backs of others without lifting any of the load myself			1
always a writer and journalist , i came out during my last year in college , stayed out in graduate school , and have been out at every job i 've ever held ; i did service work in my profession to bridge the gaps between journalists of different racial , ethnic , @entity11 and other identities			0
i know other members of the @entity11 community feel the same way about @entity12			1
" @entity88 ' @entity14 ' in ' 93 and later ' @entity89 , ' i was able to recognize and name my own gender queerness , " activist @entity87 wrote me			2
" @entity12 's quote ' gender is the poetry each of us makes out of the language we are taught ' is a truth that trans and genderqueer people live every day , and i 'm grateful for the wordsmith ( @entity12 ) helped me become			1
" we never met , but i suspect @entity12 and i would have disagreed on @entity100 and other parts of her political life			2
but that she had a larger and diverse political agenda was one of her many strengths			0
she fought for workers ' rights , marched against racism , protested against the @entity109 and fought for abortion rights in @entity111			2
gay rights , transgender rights , workers ' rights , any rights : they did not exist in a vacuum to @entity12			2
there was no parachuting into a town to get everyone rising up for gay rights but forgetting when those allies needed help on race or gender or other issues			0
@entity12 linked them all together , organized and protested in the streets and fought for all of us			1
that 's what stands out to my friend @entity131 , an openly transgendered journalist and senior editor at re / code			0
" it was the real - life struggle for justice , particularly economic justice that was @entity12 's life work and passion , " @entity131 wrote to me			1
" with @entity12 's death we each have more work to do to make this a fairer and more just world			2
" for all the progress that 's been made , i can still get fired for my identity in the state in which i live , and i still ca n't get married ( or divorced ) here			0
but i have n't been afraid for a very long time			0
that was @entity12 's gift to me , and to you .			2

@entity12 fought for justice across all lines
her novel , " @entity14 , " *inspired* a generation
she created space for many people to come out
