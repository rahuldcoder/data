-- @entity1 put its newest @entity3 satellite into orbit on monday , extending a long - running program that has been beaming back dramatic images of @entity7 for more than 40 years			1
the @entity3 -- to be designated @entity8 8 , once it 's up and running -- lifted off from @entity11 's @entity10 atop an @entity13 booster			1
the $ 855 million platform , about the size of a sport - utility vehicle , has been in the works for years amid concerns about maintaining the @entity20 suite of geoscience satellites			0
the first @entity3 mission went into orbit in 1972 ; the last working mission , @entity3 7 , was launched in 1999			1
it 's still sending back images long after its five - year life expectancy , but suffers from a scanner problem that leaves black diagonal streaks across them			0
@entity3 5 sent back its last images in january after nearly 29 years ; it had been designed to last three			2
the new mission 's solar panels deployed successfully after monday 's launch , and the satellite should be fully operational after about three months of trials , @entity1 said			1
" everyone 's very relieved			0
we 've got good telemetry coming back from @entity3 , so all is well so far , " @entity38 told @entity39			2
in 2012 , the @entity43 warned that a combination of budget pressure , program delays and a pair of launch failures in 2009 and 2011 left the @entity20 facing a " rapid decline " in its capability to monitor land and seas from space			0
an asteroid is coming , but do n't sweat it the @entity3 program is managed by @entity1 and the @entity57 , which has been distributing the data for free since 2008			1
the imagery has been used to monitor urban growth , water use , farm production and a variety of natural disasters , from the 1980 eruption of @entity66 to the historic earthquake and tsunami that struck @entity69 in 2011			0
" @entity8 is a centerpiece of @entity1 's @entity73 program , and today 's successful launch will extend the longest continuous data record of @entity7 's surface as seen from space , " @entity1 administrator @entity70 said in a statement .			0

the @entity3 satellite went into orbit monday
it 's the latest in a *series* that 's been beaming back data since 1972
