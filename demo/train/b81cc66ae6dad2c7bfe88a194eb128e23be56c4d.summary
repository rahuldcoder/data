-- @entity1 promised to help @entity3 ' athletic program bounce back after an abuse scandal rattled the university and drew national attention			1
but now the woman tapped to turn around the troubled program is facing abuse allegations herself			0
@entity11 's appointment as the school 's athletic director came more than a month after a video of a @entity3 coach hurling basketballs and yelling homophobic slurs prompted the coach 's firing , the resignation of the school 's athletic director and sharp criticism from @entity25 gov. @entity24			1
" it is a new day , " @entity11 told reporters on may 15			1
" ( the problem ) is already fixed , and there is no one that does n't agree about how we treat young people with respect and dignity and build trust			0
" but a group of former volleyball players said @entity11 used a different approach when she coached them at the @entity42 in the 1990s : " mental cruelty			1
" in a letter written in 1997 and obtained by the @entity50 - @entity49 newspaper , members of the team purportedly claimed that @entity11 called players " whores , alcoholics and learning disabled			1
" verbal abuse from @entity11 became so intense , they claimed , that the team banded together to write the letter , calling the situation " irreconcilable			1
" after the team presented the letter to @entity11 , she chose to stop coaching them , according to the newspaper 's report			1
in a written statement released monday , @entity11 said her former students ' comments are " heartbreaking			1
" she denied the allegations of abuse and vowed to push ahead in her new role			0
" i was never notified of the reported letter outlining the concerns of some former athletes			0
however , i am truly sorry that some were disappointed during my tenure as coach , " she said			0
" for sure , i was an intense coach , but there is a vast difference between high intensity and abusive behavior			1
" @entity11 said her commitment to students ' success has been firm throughout her career			1
" over the years , i have tried to learn from each mistake , including the lessons i learned as a young coach , " she said			0
" i have become a stronger leader , administrator , and educator as a result			0
if you look at my 25 - year career in athletics , i believe the record shows i am a steadfast advocate for student athletes			0
i intend to take that passion and hard - earned experience into my leadership role as athletic director of @entity3			1
" @entity3 president @entity101 said monday that he stands by the school 's choice			1
" @entity3 was deliberative at every stage of this process , " he said in a written statement			1
" over the course of the search , @entity1 's record established her as a proven leader in athletics administration with a strong commitment to academic success as well as athletic excellence , and a strong commitment to the well - being of student athletes			1
" word that @entity3 picked @entity11 to turn around the school 's athletic program after an abuse scandal came as a surprise to @entity123 , one of the players who said she wrote the letter about her coaching in 1997			1
" i think my first reaction was , ' hey , is n't that ironic ? ' of all the people that they can hire , ( they pick ) someone who 's actually done that kind of thing to me and to others , " @entity123 told @entity0 's " @entity134 " on monday			2
" over the years , she might have changed and learned her lesson			0
back then , she was a similar coach			0
" players whom @entity11 coached were pushed to a breaking point , @entity123 said			1
" you have to keep it on the court			0
once you attack someone outside the court , where you 're attacking their personality , who they are as a person , that 's where you 've crossed the line			2
there 's no reason for that , " she said			2
" i 've definitely had such tough coaches that have pushed me beyond my physical limits			0
but this was more mental and psychological			0
" a @entity42 spokeswoman declined to comment			0
the abuse allegations once again drew the attention of @entity25 's governor			2
" he 's not going to make any judgments at this time , but he expects to be talking with the @entity3 administration this week to get the details , " said @entity162 , a spokesman for @entity24			1
another allegation from @entity11 's past came up at a news conference after @entity3 announced her hiring			1
in 1997 , a jury awarded $ 150,000 to a former @entity42 assistant coach who claimed that she was fired because she was pregnant			0
to make her case , the former assistant coach , @entity175 , gave a copy of her wedding video to @entity49			0
" i hope it 's good tonight , " @entity11 , then a bridesmaid at the wedding , says in the video			1
" because i know you 've been waiting for a while , but i hope it 's not too good , because i do n't want you to come back february with any surprises , you know , the office and all , and it would be hard to have a baby in there			2
" asked about the video at a news conference this month , @entity11 appeared taken aback			1
" there 's a video ? " she asked			2
" i 'm sorry , did you say there 's a video ? there 's no video , trust me			2
" according to @entity50 - @entity200 report , @entity11 told the newspaper that @entity175 was fired because of performance issues			1
she told the newspaper she could not recall attending @entity175 's wedding and said that because she was a witness at the 1997 trial , she would not have been permitted in the courtroom when the wedding video was played			2
" on the matter of the litigation , that issue was addressed many years ago and was known to @entity3			2
i am sorry for the confusion i created by misspeaking about the existence of a video tape , " @entity11 said monday			2
" it was recorded nearly 20 years ago and i simply did not recall the video tape until i saw it in media reports			0
" @entity123 told @entity0 that she and her former teammates are n't trying to create problems for @entity11			2
" we were n't trying to cause any waves			0
honestly , i do n't think any of us expected it to get to this point , " she said			0
" hopefully , at this point @entity1 's changed , and she 's realized what a program needs			1
" the former players , @entity123 said , have moved forward			2
" once the ( athletic ) department acknowledged our letter and gave us the opportunity to speak with her , and she chose not to coach for us anymore , we all accepted it			0
we 've moved on , " she said			0
" we 're moms , we 're career women , and we 're happy			0
" @entity0 's @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .			0
