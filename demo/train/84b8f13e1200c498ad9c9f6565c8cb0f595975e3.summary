@entity0 -- @entity2 is still operating within @entity4 's mountainous tribal region bordering @entity5 , and the @entity6 lacks a " comprehensive " plan for meeting its national security goals there , said a @entity6 government study released thursday			1

despite the @entity6 providing $ 10.5 billion in military and economic aid to @entity4 , a key @entity6 ally , the @entity13 said it " found broad agreement ... that @entity2 had regenerated its ability to attack the @entity6 and had succeeded in establishing a safe haven " in @entity4 's @entity18			1
of the $ 10.5 billion in @entity6 aid , more than half -- $ 5.8 billion -- was specifically provided for the tribal region , the @entity13 said			2
furthermore , the report said , " no comprehensive plan for meeting @entity6 national security goals in @entity24 has been developed , as stipulated by the @entity25 for @entity26 [ in 2003 ] , called for by an independent commission [ in 2004 ] and mandated by congressional legislation [ in 2007 ]			1
" " our report does not state that the @entity6 lacks agency - specific plans ; rather , we found that there was no comprehensive plan that integrated the combined capabilities of @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 [ @entity37 ] , the intelligence community , " @entity13 said			1
after the september 11 terrorist attacks , @entity6 officials said intelligence indicated that @entity42 and other senior @entity2 leaders , who had been based in @entity5 before the attacks on @entity45 and @entity0 , were operating in the tribal region			2
@entity4 president @entity47 has denied that claim and has said that @entity6 military missions there would violate @entity4 's sovereignty			0
so , since 2002 , the @entity6 has " relied principally on the @entity4 military to address @entity6 national security goals " in that region , the @entity13 report said			1
of the $ 5.8 billion the @entity6 provided for aid in the tribal region , 96 percent of it reimbursed @entity4 for military operations there , the agency said			0
two of the eight lawmakers who commissioned the @entity13 report , @entity65 sens. @entity64 of @entity66 and @entity67 of @entity68 , said it indicated a failing on the part of the @entity72 administration			1
" the @entity72 administration has had six years to come up with a plan to get @entity42 and his group , but it is still flying by the seat of its pants , " @entity67 said in a statement			0
" we 've dumped 10 billion @entity6 taxpayer dollars into @entity4 with the expectation that the terrorists will be hunted down and smoked out , but @entity2 has been allowed to rejuvenate in the area that is supposed to be locked down , " he said			0
@entity64 called the report 's findings " appalling			0
" " the @entity86 must propose a strategic policy in this area and follow it , especially when we have this new opportunity to forge a fresh strategic relationship with the new civilian government in @entity4 , " he said in a statement			0
the @entity35 said it agreed with the report 's findings , according to letters attached at the end of the @entity13 report , but the @entity96 disagreed with them , saying there was a comprehensive plan in place			2
a letter from @entity102 , a spokeswoman for the office of the director of national intelligence , said that office and the @entity106 concurred with the report 's assessment that the @entity6 has not met its national security goals in the tribal region but maintained that there was a plan in place			1
@entity37 said that it generally agreed with the report 's recommendation for a comprehensive plan but that work in the tribal areas should be guided by the @entity4 government 's own @entity119 from 2006			0

@entity2 has " succeeded in establishing a safe haven , " @entity13 says
