-- @entity1 , an @entity2 - linked militant group based in @entity3 , most recently claimed responsibility for the deadly attack at @entity7 mall in september of this year and is suspected of many other attacks in @entity3			1
here is a q&a that looks at this group : what is @entity1 and what are its aims ? @entity1 is a @entity3 group that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the @entity17 government in march 2008			1
it is seeking to turn @entity3 into a fundamentalist @entity19 state , according to the @entity20 , which published a backgrounder on the group in july			1
the group is believed to be responsible for attacks in @entity3 that have killed international aid workers , journalists , civilian leaders and @entity29 peacekeepers			1
it has struck abroad , too			0
it was responsible for the july 2010 suicide bombings in @entity33 , @entity34 , that killed more than 70 people , including a @entity17 citizen , as they gathered to watch a @entity39 final soccer match			2
how big is it ? the total size of the group is not clear			0
a @entity17 official who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information said in 2011 that @entity1 was estimated to control up to 1,000 fighters in the country			1
a @entity49 report identifies one insurgent leader who is " believed to command an estimated force of between 200 and 500 fighters , " most of them @entity7			2
and it has links to other groups			0
in february 2012 , the group 's leader , @entity58 , and @entity2 leader @entity59 released a video announcing the alliance of the two organizations			2
though @entity1 's size may be in doubt , its potential for sowing terror is not			2
" i would say that the greatest risks right now in @entity71 are @entity1 and the violent extremists that they represent , " said gen. @entity68 in 2011 , when he was commander of the @entity69			0
@entity0 security analyst : @entity7 , @entity75 high on @entity1 's list @entity1 's origins decades of weak government amid grinding poverty have long made @entity3 a target for radical @entity82 groups			1
@entity1 's predecessor was @entity84 ( @entity84 ) , which worked to create an @entity82 emirate in @entity3			1
it was , in part , funded by former @entity2 leader @entity87 , according to the @entity20			0
@entity84 , which the @entity88 designated as a terrorist organization , strengthened after the fall in 1991 of @entity92 's military regime and amid the years of lawlessness that ensued			1
in 2003 , a rift erupted between @entity96 's old guard -- who were seeking to establish a new political front -- and its younger members ( @entity1 , which means " the youth " ) , who were seeking to establish fundamental @entity19 rule			0
that led the latter to ally with a group of sharia courts -- the @entity103 ( @entity103 ) -- that was seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city			1
working together , the @entity103 and @entity1 succeeded in 2006 in gaining control of @entity110			0
that sparked fears in neighboring @entity113 that violence would spill over there , according to the @entity20			0
those fears -- combined with a request from @entity3 's transitional government -- led @entity113 forces to enter @entity3 in december 2006 and to remove the @entity103 from power			2
that move proved to be a turning point , one that radicalized @entity1 , which attacked @entity113 forces and gained control of parts of central and southern @entity3 , according to a 2011 case study by @entity127 , who was then with the @entity128 at the @entity129			1
what is @entity1 's relationship with @entity7 ? in 2011 , the @entity7 government ordered a cross-border incursion intended to create a security buffer zone in southern @entity3 after attacks on tourist destinations in northern @entity7 that it blamed on @entity1			1
more recently , @entity113 troops crossed the border and expelled @entity1 from @entity140 , a strategic town midway between the @entity113 border and @entity110			0
the group then targeted @entity29 soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks			0
a suicide bombing in march 2012 killed five people at the @entity149			0
analysts say tension appears to have been growing within @entity1 between @entity3 and foreign fighters , several hundred of whom are thought to have entered @entity3 in recent years to join the group			1
there may also have been disagreement within the group about the announcement in february 2012 of an alliance between @entity1 and @entity2 and about the group 's ban on foreign aid organizations working in @entity3 to save millions threatened by famine			1
@entity1 breaks new ground with complex @entity167 attack how and from where does it recruit ? the organization has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a @entity172 account and video production abilities			1
" remember @entity174 ? " one tweet asked saturday , as gunfire was erupting from @entity177 in @entity167			0
the comment was an apparent reference to the 2008 attack in which 10 @entity182 men associated with the terrorist group @entity183 stormed several buildings in @entity174 , @entity185 , killing 164 people over a three - day period			1
" some youngsters resist death even when told not to be taken alive			0
it 's going to be a long ordeal , " saturday 's tweet said			0
soon after , it announced it was responsible for saturday 's attack in @entity167 , @entity7			2
" @entity196 confirms its behind the @entity198 spectacle , " it said			0
a 2009 @entity1 video is as slickly produced as a reality tv show , complete with a hip - hop jihad voice and a startling message			2
" mortar by mortar , shell by shell , only going to stop when i send them to hell , " an unidentified voice raps on the video in @entity205			0
the video shows a man reported to have been @entity214 , a @entity17 citizen from @entity215			0
" away from your family , away from our friends , away from ice , candy bars , all those things is because we 're waiting to meet the enemy , " he says			0
but enemies -- and alliances -- can shift			0
@entity226 , whose real name is @entity214 , said last year in a video posted online that he had had a fallout with @entity1 " regarding matters of the sharia and matters of strategy " and feared for his life			1
he was reported last week to have been killed in @entity3 by @entity1			1
@entity0 is not able to confirm the report			0
finding replacements may not be hard			0
sheikh @entity237 , a member of @entity239 's @entity3 community , said he knows of hundreds of young @entity3 men living in the @entity241 who returned to @entity3 for terrorist training			2
how is it funded ? the once - ragtag @entity3 - based @entity2 affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse , raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion , illegal taxation and other " fees , " according to the 2011 @entity49 report			1
the @entity17 believed then that the group was coordinating with @entity2 groups in @entity255 and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad			1
in 2011 , it was generating " between $ 70 million and $ 100 million per year , from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports , taxes on goods and services , taxes in kind on domestic produce , ' jihad contributions , ' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation , " according to the report from the @entity276 on @entity3 and @entity277			2
how have @entity3 been affected ? years of lawlessness and poverty have exacted a toll that @entity1 has not helped			1
in 2011 , the @entity49 declared a famine in the southern @entity3 regions of @entity283 and @entity284 , and @entity1 reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine - stricken areas			1
that year , the @entity289 for @entity290 announced that @entity3 had the highest mortality rate for children 4 and younger in the world			2
in may , a report jointly commissioned by the @entity49 @entity295 and the @entity297 - funded @entity296 reported that 258,000 @entity3 had died in the famine between october 2010 and april 2012 and that half of the victims were younger than five			2
what is the @entity17 doing ? the @entity17 has supported @entity49 - backed @entity303 forces fighting @entity1 and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group			1
it has also donated millions in aid			0
the @entity88 said this week that @entity3 security forces , aided by the @entity308 in @entity3 , have driven @entity1 out of major cities and towns , creating " a window of opportunity to fundamentally change @entity3 's trajectory			1
what is the status of @entity3 's government today ? in september 2012 , @entity3 parliament members selected @entity318 as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation , which had not had a stable central government since @entity92 's overthrow 21 years before			1
that did not mean @entity1 was calling it quits			0
in january , @entity328 forces attempted to rescue a @entity328 intelligence commando held hostage in @entity3 by the group			2
the raid left the soldier dead , another soldier missing and 17 @entity82 fighters dead			0
but there has been political progress there			0
in january , for the first time in more than two decades , the @entity17 granted official recognition to the @entity3 government			1
