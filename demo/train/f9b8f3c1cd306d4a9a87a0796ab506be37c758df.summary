-- on thursday , the " fight for $ 15 " enters a new phase , with strikes and demonstrations at fast - food restaurants not only in up to 150 cities across the @entity6 but also in about 30 nations across the globe			1
fast - food workers can already claim their first major victory right here at home			1
recently , @entity14 mayor @entity13 announced a plan to gradually lift the city 's minimum wage to $ 15			1
as a result , 100,000 workers in the city -- including nearly every fast - food worker -- will get a raise			1
from a worker 's point of view , the agreement , expected to be passed by the @entity24 in coming weeks , is not perfect			0
businesses with as many as 500 employees , for example , will have until 2019 to guarantee their workers $ 15 an hour in total compensation , and until 2021 to pay a full $ 15 in hourly wages			2
no doubt some businesses within this category could sustain a faster increase			0
nor does the agreement mean that fast - food and other workers will be able to freely form a union at their workplaces , a critical step in solidifying wage gains made through policy and guaranteeing other core benefits such as fair work schedules and sick leave			1
but this should not detract from what @entity14 's workers and their advocates have accomplished -- thanks in large part to the fast - food worker strikes and the groundswell of local support it generated			1
check out the minimum wage in your state to date , the corporate leaders of the @entity6 @entity61 and the @entity62 -- @entity63 's , @entity64 and @entity65 among them -- have greeted every proposal for a minimum wage of even $ 10 with dire predictions of economic chaos and a fusillade of lobbying cash to squash them			1
but businesses have never had uniform views on wages			0
polling by the @entity77 reveals that 57 % of small businesses support raising the minimum wage			0
thousands of @entity81 businesses -- and larger firms -- voluntarily choose to pay their workers more because it lowers employee turnover , improves performance and generates spending in their own stores			0
these fissures in the business community have become open cracks in @entity14			0
although @entity95 , president of the @entity96 , was one of only three members of the mayor 's @entity98 on income equality not to vote for the wage agreement , 10 other business leaders on the committee did			0
the businesses these individuals represent span companies as large as @entity107 member @entity105 and as modest as @entity108 , a local pizzeria			0
undoubtedly , some business representatives on the mayor 's advisory group are backing a $ 15 wage out of pragmatism rather than principle			2
@entity14 worker groups and advocates are well - organized and enjoy the support of the mayor , the entire @entity24 and most @entity14 residents ; better to participate and be able to shape the final contours of the inevitable wage increase than oppose the process entirely			2
nevertheless , businesses are n't charities , as conservatives like to say , and so the fact that a spectrum of @entity14 businesses have signed off on a $ 15 minimum wage undercuts opponents ' predictions of business closures and mass layoffs -- for if that were the inevitable result of the increase , why would @entity14 's businesses swallow such a pill voluntarily ? real - life wage increases in other cities show that @entity14 's businesses are in fact being quite rational			1
the @entity141 reports that in the year since @entity141 raised its minimum wage , business has grown by 3 % -- about 10,000 new businesses were registered -- unemployment has dropped from 7.6 % to 6.3 % , and the cost of enforcing the new wage has been negligible			0
and if @entity14 can sustain $ 15 , why not other cities ? movements are afoot in @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156 to raise those cities ' minimum wages well above the $ 10.10 mark that congressional @entity160 and president @entity161 are pushing nationally			1
opponents of wage increases will be quick to paint @entity14 as an outlier , but business conditions in all of these cities -- and many others -- are comparable enough to @entity14 that there is no reason why they ca n't absorb a similarly gradual increase to $ 15			1
see who the may 15 protesters are in the end , the outcome in @entity14 demonstrates what history has proved time and time again : when workers are well - organized and there is broad support for higher wages , even businesses that resist the idea are ultimately forced to pay more -- and they adjust			2
after experiencing years of wage stagnation while the wealthiest make money hand over fist , middle and working class @entity6 are rightfully insisting on a larger share of the nation 's prosperity			0
in years past , the corporate establishment may have been able to subdue this agitation with references to " job creators " and patronizing warnings against " hurting those you want to help			0
" but @entity6 -- low - wage workers , middle class families and even many business owners -- have had enough			2
the movement to create a decent life and a truly sustainable economy for us all can no longer be stifled			0
look out : the wall of resistance to a $ 15 an hour minimum wage has been breached -- and the flood is coming to your city , too .			1
