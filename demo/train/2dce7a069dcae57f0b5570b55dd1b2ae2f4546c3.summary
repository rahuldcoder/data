@entity18 diplomatic posts in some 20 countries under threat @entity8 said threats to @entity18 diplomatic posts are ongoing			1
" sitting here today , we probably have at least 20 other posts that are under a serious threat environment as i speak to you , " she told senators			0

" @entity8 detailed what the @entity69 has done to begin implementing the 29 recommendations of the @entity112 to improve security at diplomatic posts in high - threat areas , in addition to a few of her own			0
opinion : @entity12 blame game is useless specifically , @entity8 has appointed a team , led by her deputy , to focus on tightening security , sent joint teams of military special forces and diplomatic security threat analysts to more than a dozen high - risk posts and appointed a senior official to focus exclusively on those areas			1

opinion : @entity189 vs. @entity0 , clash of titans when sen. @entity192 pressed @entity8 on why the @entity69 did n't call @entity18 personnel who were evacuated from @entity12 to determine whether there was a protest , @entity8 took him to task			1
" with all due respect , the fact is we had four dead @entity18 , " @entity8 reminded @entity192 as she banged her hand on the table			2
" was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they 'd go kill some @entity18 ? what difference , at this point , does it make ? it is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening , " she said			2
