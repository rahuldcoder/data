-- almost a year to the day after learning he had the deadliest form of brain cancer , @entity1 was dancing at his daughter @entity6 's wedding			1
" to have my dad there was just one of those moments where you really want to stop time , " @entity7 says			0
" you want to look at him and hold on tight			0
" fewer than one in three patients with @entity1 's type of cancer , a glioblastoma , have traditionally survived a year , let alone been well enough to dance			1
but @entity1 , 61 , has something going for him beyond radiation and chemotherapy -- a custom - made vaccine			1
@entity1 ( pronounced @entity23 ) received the vaccine as part of a clinical trial at the @entity26			1
" the approach that we take is we actually do the surgery			0
we take the tumor out , and then we make the vaccine directly from that individual patient 's tumor			2
and then give that vaccine back to the patient , " says dr. @entity33 , who heads the trial			2
glioblastomas have been particularly deadly because no matter how skilled , neurosurgeons can not remove the entire tumor			0
some cancer cells remain hidden in the brain and eventually grow back -- usually within months			1
it 's in the family of brain cancers that claimed the life of sen. @entity45			2
so far , @entity33 's ongoing clinical trial is beating those odds			1
more than a year into the trial , none of the eight patients who have received vaccines made from their tumors has seen cancer return			1
" it 's really , really encouraging , " @entity33 says , adding that it 's too early to draw any big conclusions			0
the vaccines are designed to alert the body to cells that do n't belong and trigger the body 's immune system to attack multiple points on the cancer cells			1
how many vaccine doses patients receive depend on how much of the tumor surgeons are able to remove			2
@entity1 had the first of 14 vaccine doses in february			1
using a vaccine to fight cancer makes sense to @entity1 , a biologist who lives in @entity71 , @entity72			1
" @entity73 works , polio works , " says @entity1			2
" you 're allowing your own body to combat the cancer , which is an irregularity anyway			2
" @entity33 envisions someday treating glioblastomas as a chronic disease , rather than a death sentence			0
" i do n't think that it 's appropriate to use the word cure with glioblastoma			0
we really want to turn this into a chronic disease like hypertension or diabetes that allows you to take medicine to live a normal life , " he says			0
@entity33 's research is being funded by a combination of federal grants and donations from advocacy groups such as the @entity97			0
" this trial would not have happened without the support of patient advocacy groups , " @entity33 says			0
in addition to @entity26 , @entity102 and @entity103 are also testing the vaccine , and the clinical trial may expand to more hospitals			1
in the past month , @entity1 has walked @entity6 down the aisle and celebrated his 36th wedding anniversary			0
he is upbeat about the future			0
" i 'm really hopeful that the vaccine works and i can get another 20 years of life , " @entity1 says .			1

clinical trial to treat glioblastomas tests vaccines made from patients ' own tumors
no patients who received vaccines have seen their cancers return
the vaccines alert the body 's immune system to attack multiple points on the cancer cells .
