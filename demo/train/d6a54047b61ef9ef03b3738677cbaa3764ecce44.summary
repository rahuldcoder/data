but a woman who witnessed the incident later told @entity45 network @entity90 that she found @entity4 a block from the wine bar and not 10 kilometers away as he had suggested			2
" two homeless people were kicking me -- i do n't know if they were just trying to see if i was alive			2
but they were trying to take stuff off me , but all i had on me was my clothes , " @entity4 explained			2
" i started running down the street away from them once i 'd pulled myself together , and this lady was helping me , she was fantastic			0

" there is no kidnapping investigation going on			0
i do n't want to get into the details but his ( @entity4 's ) story with us has been very consistent			1
