a dozen @entity21 political activists now living under asylum in the @entity23 claim foreign oil companies were complicit in violent abuse at the hands of their former country 's military			1

now the court will decide that and a more fundamental question : whether the 1789 federal law can be applied to any conduct committed entirely outside the @entity23			0
" do you disagree [ there ] are fair [ international ] judicial systems where a plaintiff can get a fair shake ? " said justice @entity50 , reflecting general conservative skepticism			0
" if that 's so , then why does this case belong in the courts of the @entity23 , when it has nothing to do with the @entity23 other than the fact that a subsidiary of the defendant has a big operation here ? " but other justices said federal courts for two centuries were open to such foreign claims , initially in response to piracy on the high seas			1
" we gave a stamp of approval " to such lawsuits in a 1980 case , said justice @entity72 , " understanding that there were certain categories of offenders who were today 's pirates			2
" chief justice @entity81 wasted little time before moving on to the first of two cases			0

the @entity21 government 's 1993 - 95 crackdown sparked global outrage after author @entity116 and eight other activists were convicted , then hanged			1
among those bringing suit is his nephew , @entity120 , who escaped the oppression and now lives in @entity122 as a political refugee			0
he described being a student activist beaten by soldiers for hours in front of a crowd of onlookers , then detained and tortured for days			0
he claims @entity101 -- based in the @entity129 and @entity130 -- conspired with the government to keep its business operations going in the face of protests and should be held accountable for ignoring or encouraging a pattern of killings , rapes , beatings , and property destruction			1
he said the only place to obtain justice is in the @entity23			0
" @entity21 's dictatorship has grown rich from its oil , " @entity142 told @entity1			1
" it is important those ( oil ) companies be held responsible , because we can not bring any legal action in courts in @entity21			1
" the @entity23 law in question is the @entity153 , which gives federal courts jurisdiction over civil claims from foreigners that they were harmed by international law violations			0

" you 're basically saying [ the prior cases ] were all wrong , " said @entity204			0
" counsel , how can you say that ? maybe the facts did n't , but certainly the reasoning of the case addressed that issue very directly , basically said it does " give @entity21 a chance to make their case in @entity23 courts			1
