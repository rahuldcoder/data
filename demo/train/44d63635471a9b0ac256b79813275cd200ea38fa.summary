-- just 38 days separated the lowest moment in @entity3 ' 2012 season , and the undisputed highlight			1
after a crushing first round defeat at the @entity8 to world no. 111 @entity6 in may the 31 - year - old was so distraught she did n't leave the house for two days			1
but just over a month later @entity3 was hoisting her fifth @entity12 title -- her 14th grand slam singles win -- a triumph she had n't thought possible after a blood clot on her lung nearly ended her career prematurely			1
it proved the catalyst for an all conquering end to the season , as @entity3 won every major title on offer , including two olympic gold medals , in the singles and in the doubles with sister @entity27 , the @entity28 and the season - ending @entity30 championships			1
it prompted many to isolate that decimating defeat in @entity33 as the kick start her season needed but speaking to @entity0 's @entity37 , @entity3 offered a different explanation			1
" i think that for me the turning point was in april , " she said			0
" i had decided that i wanted to play better , and i told my dad , ' i want to play , for the rest of my career , i want to play better , i want to be focused and what are we going to do about it ? ' " then for me to lose in @entity33 was completely disappointing			0
i was completely shattered , i was really sad , and i did n't leave my house for two days			1
" that self doubt resurfaced during the final at @entity12 , in front of a packed @entity50			2
having breezed through the opening set against @entity53 , competing in her maiden grand slam final , the @entity51 fought back to take the second set 7 - 5 , sparking a mini meltdown in @entity3			1
" i lost the second set , i panicked and then after that i thought , ' i 'm never going to win another grand slam , i 'm going to be stuck at 13 for the rest of my life ' , " she said			0
" i should have been happy the last time i won @entity12 , and then when i was in the hospital i thought i would n't even play tennis again , so to have that opportunity from going from that low , from the bottom to the top , it was probably the highlight of my year			1
" @entity70 recently compared taking on @entity3 to playing a wall -- everything comes back			1
but @entity3 concedes her outward demeanor -- stalking the court in such intimidating , predatory fashion -- is sometimes a shield to what is really going on inside			2
" i do n't look at me being great or me being good , " she explained			2
" i just am a player and i know i 'm good at tennis			0
and i get nervous , i get apprehensive , i have all those feelings			0
" i do ( hide them )			0
i 'm a good actress			0
but i have all those emotions and feelings , which i think is completely normal			0
and then sometimes , i think really what helps me is i 'm really strong mentally , so it helps me get through it			0
" if that was @entity3 's individual highlight of the year there is no doubt as to the collective one			1
after a long absence from the women 's tour due to a foot injury and the subsequent blood clot on her lung , @entity3 returned to action for the first time in nearly a year at @entity98 in june 2011			1
but within three months of her comeback there was more bad news for the @entity3 sisters as @entity27 was diagnosed with @entity104 's syndrome -- an autoimmune disorder that causes joint pain and can deplete energy levels			1
it would be february before she returned to the tour full time but , just like @entity3 , her form was patchy -- until @entity12 arrived			1
undeniably , the famous environs of @entity111 propel both @entity27 and @entity3 to a higher plane			1
on the same day @entity3 secured the singles title , the @entity3 sisters took their fifth doubles crown at the @entity115 -- a sign their stranglehold on the women 's game is far from over			2
but it was the success they shared just a few weeks later at the @entity121 on the same showpiece court that meant most to @entity3			1
" @entity27 and i went through so much , her finding out about her @entity104 's disease and myself with my near - death experience in the hospital , and to share that moment on the podium and holding that gold medal was , was amazing			1
" the pair enjoyed their most recent @entity131 experience so much they confirmed to @entity0 they 'd be sticking around to defend their title at @entity134 in 2016			2
and when they both say they enjoy each other 's success as much as their own it is n't hard to believe , especially when @entity3 talks of her sister 's first tour victory in two years at the @entity138 in october			1
" @entity27 winning after two years is great , " @entity3 said			1
" she 's been through even more than i 've been through			0
" and so she 's been working really hard , and i see it , i see her work really hard , and go through things that no athlete should go through and continue to play professional sport			0
i 'm in awe of her , really			2
" just as both sisters revel in the delight when the other wins , so they share the despair when the other loses			0
@entity3 added : " i can watch her in person , but i ca n't watch ( on television )			2
when she played her semifinal ( in @entity161 ) i was so nervous , she lost the first set and she was up , and i felt like she should have won			0
" i was angry , i was angry at everybody around me , i could n't be normal			2
so yeah , like when she wins , i win , i feel the same way , and when she loses , oh , i lose			0
" though there are 15 months between the sisters there is no doubt their watertight relationship has helped them as players throughout their career			0
@entity3 likens their bond to that of twins			2
" she 's done so much for me			0
i think one of the hardest jobs in the world is to be an older sister			0
and i think @entity27 is an amazing older sister , she was a great role model for me , and we feel each other -- i can talk to her			2
" she knows exactly how i feel about so many different issues , and i love it			0
i love having that relationship			0
