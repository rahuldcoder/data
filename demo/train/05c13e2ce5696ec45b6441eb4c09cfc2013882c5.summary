@entity0 , a former @entity1 stock clerk who once lived in the same neighborhood as @entity3 , was arrested thursday in connection with his death , more than three decades after the 6 - year - old went missing			1
a then - 19 - year - old @entity0 allegedly lured @entity8 to a store with the promise of a soda , choked him in the basement and then disposed of the body using a plastic bag , placing it in the trash about a block and a half away , police commissioner @entity7 told reporters			1
" detectives believe in the credibility of the statement , " @entity7 said , referring to the man 's earlier confession			1
authorities were alerted to the suspect by a tip. @entity0 , who had been working in construction until an injury sidelined him , is expected to be charged with second - degree murder , @entity7 said			1
the suspect is expected to make an initial appearance in court friday , with the district attorney 's office formally filing paperwork			1
he has no prior criminal record and is the father of a teenage girl , @entity7 said			1
@entity40 's disappearance exactly 33 years ago on friday helped spawn a national movement to raise awareness of missing children , which involved a then - novel approach of splashing an image of the child 's face across thousands of milk cartons			0
according to police , in the years following @entity40 's disappearance , @entity0 told a family member and others that he had " done a bad thing " and killed a child in @entity56			1
he voluntarily left @entity57 on wednesday night with detectives to travel to @entity1 and the building , currently an optical business			2
@entity7 described the suspect as remorseful			1
" the detectives thought it was a feeling of relief on his part			2
" he told reporters that other employees of the store were interviewed after @entity40 disappeared , but not @entity0			1
" i ca n't tell you why , " said @entity7 , indicating the case apparently was a crime of opportunity			1
the commissioner said it is unlikely police will find @entity40 's remains			1
in her book detailing the investigation , author @entity77 describes the plan @entity40 had the day he went missing			1
just prior to his disappearance , according to the book , @entity8 told his parents that he planned to stop at a store to buy a soda with a dollar that he 'd earned by helping a neighborhood carpenter			2
the carpenter , @entity89 , 75 , had met @entity40 the day before and was recently the focus of media attention when investigators announced they were again questioning him			2
" mr. @entity89 is relieved by these developments , as he was not involved in any way with @entity3 's disappearance , " said @entity89 's attorney @entity93			0
" at the same time , mr. @entity89 is very pleased that those responsible for this heinous crime may be brought to justice , and the @entity8 family may finally have the closure they deserve			0
" but a separate law enforcement source said thursday that @entity0 's claims were being treated with " a healthy dose of skepticism			1
" investigators have not uncovered any forensic evidence linking @entity0 to the case , @entity7 added			1
@entity0 's name " came up more than once while interviewing others recently , " said a law enforcement source , who added that authorities had been familiar with him years ago			1
renewed attention over the @entity8 case sprung up last month when investigators scoured @entity89 's @entity118 basement , where @entity40 had been seen a day before he went missing			1
but their search produced no apparent clues			0
the tipster contacted authorities months ago after news coverage of their renewed search			0
that contact , at least in part , prompted investigators to question @entity0			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity1 district attorney 's office , which reopened the case in 2010 , declined to comment on the recent development			2
@entity56 mayor @entity134 added that there 's " still a lot more investigating to do			0
" " to his credit , district attorney @entity138 reopened ( the investigation ) in hopes not only of bringing justice , but also offering some closure to @entity40 's parents , " the mayor told reporters thursday			2
" and as a father , i just can not imagine what they 've gone through			0
" @entity40 went missing on may 25 , 1979 , a block from his home in the @entity1 neighborhood of @entity118			0
it was the first time that he had walked to his school bus stop by himself			0
his mother , @entity153 , learned after her son failed to return home that he had n't been in classes that day			0
after calling the school and @entity40 's friends , she then called police			2
the boy was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a lawsuit filed by his family against a drifter , @entity164 , a convicted child molester acquainted with @entity40 's babysitter			0
a judge found @entity168 responsible for the boy 's death and ordered him to pay the family $ 2 million -- money the @entity8 family has never received			0
though @entity164 was considered a key focus of the investigation for years , he has never been charged in the case			1
he is serving a 20 - year prison sentence in @entity178 for molesting another boy and is set to be released this year			0
a source has previously said investigators wanted to expand the pool of possible suspects beyond @entity164			2
parents @entity185 and @entity186 still live in their @entity118 home and have not commented on the new developments			0
police said thursday that @entity8 was a little surprised and overwhelmed by thursday 's developments			2
@entity77 , author of " after @entity40 : the missing child case that held @entity194 , " told @entity192 earlier that " the family 's been living through this for 33 years			1
they 've had many moments like this			0
they 've learned how to deal with it			0
" thursday evening , @entity77 told @entity192 's " @entity201 " she had not heard of @entity0 before the arrest			1
the @entity8 family , she said , wo n't be making any quick judgments on this case			0
just weeks after @entity40 disappeared , an attacker abducted the first of more than 20 children to be kidnapped and killed in @entity209			0
a suspect in that case was arrested two years later			2
in 1984 , @entity211 passed the @entity212 , which led to the creation of the @entity214			0
president @entity215 named may 25 , the day @entity40 went missing , as @entity216 .			0

author of book on investigation had never heard of suspect
investigators have not uncovered forensic evidence linking @entity0 to the case , @entity7 says
" detectives believe in the credibility of the statement , " police commissioner @entity7 says
@entity0 is expected to be charged with second degree murder , police say
