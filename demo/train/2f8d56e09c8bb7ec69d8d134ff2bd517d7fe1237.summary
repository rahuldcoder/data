@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 is second only to @entity3 as the country with the highest number of hiv / aids sufferers ; one would have thought a better gift for the @entity8 from the government to its people would be to urge the national legislature to pass the anti hiv - discrimination bill that has been with them for a while			1
but alas , what the people received was a bill that further exposes them to violence and discrimination			0
while the signing of the bill has generated much reaction on both sides , most of its supporters have based their arguments on religion and @entity29 values , forgetting that what binds the nation together is not the divergence of religions but the respect for humanity that is enshrined in the 1999 constitution			0
what the same - sex marriage ( prohibition ) bill in fact does is negate the principle of fundamental human rights of association , expression and dignity			2
when a law does this , it runs the risk of breeding anarchy , an experience that people who are or are merely perceived to be gay know all too much about in the form of blackmail , extortion and fear of arrest			0
the law also acts against the principle of public health			1
with rates of hiv infection and @entity63 running at 3.7 % for the general population , and 17.2 % among gay men , criminalizing organizations providing intervention for this population puts all @entity1 in jeopardy			1
another thing to note is about the public perception of the law : while many perceive there 's casual acceptance by many @entity1 of the bill , in fact many of those who have commented on the bill have not even read it			2
aside from the fact that sections of this law are in direct violation of our fundamental human rights -- freedom of expression and assembly , freedom to have a private and family life -- and set back the provision of healthcare services , they effectively signify that it is open season to attack the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( @entity99 ) community and mainstream society in general			1
already 10 people have been arrested for their perceived sexual orientation by law enforcement agencies across @entity1 , a human rights group said			1
the witch hunt to arrest many more by forcing names out of those arrested is also gathering momentum			0
the disturbing factor here is on what basis these individuals were arrested ; we believe most have been detained due to anonymous tips that are inaccurate in most cases			0
many more of these violations of human rights will take place if this law is not repealed ; blackmail and extortion will become commonplace against @entity99 people and the @entity1 at large and little will be done to ensure that organizations providing healthcare service for this population are able to carry out their work in responding to the @entity126 in the country			1
we therefore implore the @entity1 president and his good government to repeal this law , which , we fear , could blow into an unbearable catastrophe for @entity1 and its citizens			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			0

@entity1 is country with 2nd most hiv / @entity63 sufferers
