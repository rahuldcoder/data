-- some people believed that one of the most democratic ways out of the conflict between @entity5 and @entity6 was to let people of @entity8 decide their fates for themselves through a referendum			1
but there were a few serious flaws with that " democratic " approach			2
sunday , march 16 , was a day many @entity6 waited for with concern and dread			0
originally , the referendum was planned for may 25 , then moved up to march 30 and then once again moved to march 16			0
prime minister @entity17 and @entity18 , speaker of @entity19 , were eager to accomplish the task @entity5 president @entity21 had given them			1
that task was to provide @entity5 with some kind of excuse for a military intervention that had in fact started on february 28 , when there were reports of @entity5 soldiers occupying the @entity31			1
long before the referendum took place , the international community expressed concerns about its legitimacy , and many people in @entity6 considered it illegal			2
this kind of referendum violates the @entity40 , which specifies that it can be done only countrywide			0
and does this mean that @entity5 can invade any country where there is a @entity5 - speaking enclave ? @entity5 even owned @entity45 once			1
should they get that back , too ? @entity31 's vote : was it legal ? to no surprise , @entity17 reported that more than 80 % of people in @entity8 voted in the referendum and 96 % voted for @entity8 to join @entity5			1
the results themselves did n't matter , as everybody knew they would be false			0
there are certainly some people who have been brainwashed by @entity5 tv channels ( @entity6 stations have been cut off in @entity8 ) and do believe in lies that in @entity8 will be given all kinds of advantages and privileges			2
but also consider that the vote took place under the guns of @entity5 troops and residents were given less than two weeks to prepare			1
it is unsafe to be pro-ukrainian in @entity8 right now , as the region is controlled by @entity5 military and hired thugs			2
the announcement of results signaled to the people of @entity6 that a quiet waiting period of our conflict with @entity5 is probably over			2
even though the @entity81 , @entity78 , @entity79 and other international observers do not recognize results of referendum , @entity5 is still claiming that @entity31 will join with them			1
so the tension has come up to higher levels			0
the @entity86 has announced partial mobilization of army reserves			0
annexation of @entity31 opportune or opportunistic ? my friends and colleagues in @entity8 tell me that people are standing in long lines to withdraw money from banks			1
many atms do not have cash , and stores do not accept credit cards			1
retired people are concerned about their pensions being paid on time			0
@entity6 are still not sure what their preparations should be			0
will our troops try to liberate @entity31 from @entity5 invaders ? will @entity5 troops try to invade eastern regions of @entity6 where @entity5 provocateurs have been trying to cause trouble , too ? did @entity21 set his goals not just for @entity31 but the whole of @entity6 ? @entity21 keeps talking about @entity6 as a failed state and the @entity6 government as not legitimate , though it 's recognized by all other countries in the world			1
the bottom line is this : the referendum is a farce that the whole world has pronounced illegitimate , but it is being used by @entity21 to escalate conflict to next level			0
his ambitions for restoring the @entity127 in the form of a new @entity129 are no secret			0
even @entity21 's allies , such as @entity132 and @entity133 , are nervous			0
it 's hard to not be concerned if you live anywhere in @entity6 -- or in @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 or @entity140			0
are you in @entity6 , @entity8 or @entity5 ? have you witnessed the unrest ? what do you think about the region 's future ? share your stories with @entity147 , but please stay safe			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			2

@entity150 : @entity31 's referendum to join @entity5 was not democratic
" the vote took place under the guns of @entity5 troops , " says the @entity155 resident
@entity150 says there are already problems with banks and credit cards
she has been *documenting* unrest in her country since february
