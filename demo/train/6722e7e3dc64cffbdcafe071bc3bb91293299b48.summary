@entity1 new allegations have emerged from the man described as the 20th 9/11 hijacker , alleging members of the @entity7 royal family supported @entity8			1
@entity9 , who pleaded guilty in 2005 to six terror - related charges , makes the allegations in a sworn statement contained in a brief submitted tuesday as part of an ongoing civil case by the families of 9/11 victims			1
in the late 1990s , @entity9 says , he was tasked by @entity18 to create a digital database cataloging @entity8 's donors			1
every day for two or three months , he says , he entered names of the group 's donors into a @entity25 computer , along with how much they gave			0
@entity9 , who has been in @entity28 custody for more than 13 years , said the list featured high - profile people , including several members of the @entity7 royal family , whom he named in his testimony			1
they include @entity34 , former director - general of @entity7 's @entity35 and ambassador to the @entity28			1
@entity9 , a @entity37 national , said he was chosen for the database job because of his education and ability to speak @entity41			2
" @entity43 wanted to keep a record who give money ... who is to be listened to or who contribute to -- to the jihad , " he said in sometimes stuttered answers			0
@entity2 can not independently confirm the claims @entity9 makes in his new testimony , which was made under oath as part of a brief filed in opposition to a motion to dismiss a case against @entity7 for its alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks			1
unlike a deposition , @entity9 was not subjected to cross-examination by the defendants ' lawyers			2
@entity9 's credibility has been called into question before			1
and though @entity7 's role in the attacks has long been a topic of suspicion , the @entity67 's report , released in 2004 , concluded there was no evidence the @entity7 government funded @entity8			1
see also : @entity75 captors ' did n't even have the @entity76 ' " it does not appear that any government other than the @entity79 financially supported @entity8 before 9/11 , although some governments may have contained @entity8 sympathizers who turned a blind eye to @entity8 's fund - raising activities , " the report said			1
" @entity7 has long been considered the primary source of @entity8 funding , but we have found no evidence that the @entity7 government as an institution or senior @entity7 officials individually funded the organization			1
" still , the report noted in parentheses , " this conclusion does not exclude the likelihood that charities with significant @entity7 government sponsorship diverted funds to @entity8			1
" in a statement reacting to these latest allegations , the @entity99 in @entity1 said , " there is no evidence to support @entity9 's claim			1
the sept. 11 attack has been the most intensely investigated crime in history and the findings show no involvement by the @entity7 government or @entity7 officials			2
" the @entity7 statement also referred to the assessment of the @entity67			2
" @entity9 is a deranged criminal whose own lawyers presented evidence that he was mentally incompetent			2
his words have no credibility , " the statement said			0
" ( @entity9 's ) goal in making these statements only serves to get attention for himself and try to do what he could not do through acts of terrorism -- to undermine @entity7 - @entity28 relations			1
" @entity9 's new sworn statements were taken in october at a supermax prison in @entity129 , @entity130 , where he has been held since his life sentence was handed down in 2006			1
related : @entity7 dilemma : how to spot potential terrorists in them , @entity9 goes on to say he met with members of the @entity7 royal family in person more than once in @entity7 , in order to hand - deliver letters to and from @entity8 's notorious leader			1
" i was introduced as the messenger for @entity143 , " @entity9 told attorneys on oct. 21			2
" did they treat you well during the [ first ] visit ? " the lawyer asked			0
" extremely well , " @entity9 said			0
@entity9 said he traveled on private jets and in limousines			0
his meetings took place in luxury hotels and even @entity7 palaces			0
he was also given money for travel expenses at the @entity99 in @entity156 , which he considered a bribe , he said			0
furthermore , @entity9 said his primary point of contact with the royal family was @entity34 , and that @entity161 introduced him to other prominent members of the family , including another former @entity7 ambassador to @entity1 , prince @entity164			1
tuesday 's court filing also included statements by three members of the @entity67 , former secretary of the navy @entity168 , and former sens. @entity170 and @entity171			0
their statements do not support the specific claims @entity9 makes , but do say that further investigation of @entity7 government involvement is necessary			1
" i am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the sept. 11th attacks and the government of @entity7 , " @entity170 wrote			2
@entity171 told @entity2 on friday that while he ca n't verify @entity9 's specific allegations , he does believe the new information highlights the need for further investigation			1
" it deepens suspicions that everything about @entity7 involvement is not as well - known as it should be , " he said			2
but this suspicion of the @entity7 government is not shared by all			0
@entity193 , who was @entity28 ambassador to @entity7 from 2001 to 2003 , told @entity2 he " was given no hint whatsoever of direct @entity7 leadership involvement -- any financing or any planning -- for these attacks			1
" @entity193 said he was regularly in touch with @entity200 and @entity201 , who led the @entity202 and @entity203 , respectively , and felt assured over the course of their investigation that allegations against the @entity7 government were without merit			2
" a lot of it was my own questioning , " said @entity193			0
" ' are you sure ? have you made certain that none of the people we 're dealing with now at the senior level had anything to do with these attacks or with supporting the terrorists who financed and orchestrated them ? ' and i was routinely and universally given the information that they felt comfortable at least at the senior level they had n't			0
" see also : why @entity225 says fight with @entity75 is n't a religious war @entity9 has made incriminating claims about the @entity7 government before			1
last november , he said that @entity99 officials were involved in a plot to shoot down @entity231 " to assassinate @entity232 and / or @entity233			0
" he also said at that time that he had met with a @entity7 prince and princess in early 2001 when he was taking flying lessons in @entity237 , @entity238 , and that she " gave me money			0
" lawyers for the @entity7 government denied those claims , saying pointedly , " the @entity7 had no role in the attacks of sept. 11 , 2001			2
" and the @entity7 are not the only ones who have refuted @entity9 's account of the 9/11 plot			1
in 2006 , @entity18 released an audiotape in which he denied @entity9 's assertion that he was supposed to strike the @entity250 with a 747 on september 11 , 2001			1
" i am the one in charge of the 19 brothers , " @entity18 said , referring to the 19 known hijackers , " and i never assigned brother @entity9 to be with them in that mission			0
" many -- if not all -- of @entity9 's statements over the years have been called into question			1
during his 2006 sentencing trial , an expert witness testified that @entity9 suffered from delusional paranoid schizophrenia			0
he was prone to loud and disruptive outbursts during that trial , and guards testified he would sometimes make irrational claims to them			0
he has also asked for certain concessions in exchange for testimony , such as a warmer cell in a different unit of the supermax prison			0
beyond his claims about the donor database , @entity9 also says in this latest sworn statement that he was involved in a series of other plots against @entity28 targets			2
specifically , he says he was given explosives training to attack the @entity279 in @entity280 with a truck bomb			0
" i conducted a trial test of explosives for bomb of 750 kilogram of ammonium nitrate , " he said			0
" the plot was agreed with @entity143			0
" @entity9 said his team in that plot included @entity289 , known as " the shoe bomber , " who @entity9 previously said was supposed to take part in the 9/11 attacks -- allegations that @entity289 has denied			1
the plot against the embassy in @entity280 was eventually canceled , @entity9 said , and he was sent to @entity297 to explore the possibility of attacking the @entity279 in @entity299			0
that plot was also canceled , @entity9 told his attorneys , so he went to the @entity28 to look into attacking @entity231 -- the plot he first revealed in november			2
" my plan was not to launch the attack , " he insisted in the statement			0
" it was only to see the feasibility of the attack			0
" @entity2 's @entity308 , @entity309 and @entity310 contributed to this report .			0
