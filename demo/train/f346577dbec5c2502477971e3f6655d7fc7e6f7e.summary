@entity0 -- while @entity2 go to those who do makeup , design costumes and mix sound for movies , those who crash cars , fall from tall buildings and blow things up ca n't get an @entity2			1
stunt coordinator @entity11 has broken his back twice and his neck once during his 32 - year career			2
he 's hit a brick wall for the past 20 years trying to convince the @entity16 to honor his profession			1
" i think it 's the acknowledgement that we all want for our efforts , because we are a big part of the movie - making industry and we see all of our other department heads getting these @entity2 , " @entity18 said friday			1
an @entity16 committee meets on june 14 to again decide if a new @entity2 category will be created for best stunt coordinator in a movie , which @entity32 editor @entity31 says is " one of many areas the @entity2 overlook and should n't			1
" when the @entity16 governors voted five years ago against a stunt @entity2 , it appeared that the development of computer - generated imagery ( @entity39 ) would reduce demand for live stunt performers in movie production , @entity18 said			1
" but in reality , the stunt person has evolved into a different type of stunt person , " he said			2
" he is now an integral part of the @entity39 aspect of it and we employ as many stunt people now as we did in the past			0
" this year 's blockbuster " @entity54 " was noteworthy for its real stunts , said @entity18 , who worked on the action film as a stunt coordinator			1
" we 're going back to real physical stunts because the audience can now tell the difference and once an audience member can tell the difference between what 's real and what 's fake , it takes him out of the element and he does n't believe that he 's part of that action scene , " he said			1
@entity18 , who started his career jumping ditches with the " @entity73 " on tv 's " @entity74 , " said the stunt business is getting more dangerous , not less			0
" they want bigger and better , " he said			0
" they want to push the envelope			0
they want to get to a point to do things that nobody 's ever seen before			0
" " @entity54 " required @entity18 to figure out how to pull a 10 - ton bank vault with two cars			0
" you 're always doing things that tax your ability and you have to try to get in there and figure it all out and that 's what a stunt coordinator does , " he said			0
even movies without crashes , blasts and falls need stunt coordinators to " keep actors safe and to make sure that all the action works , " he said			1
" @entity105 , " which was completely computer - generated , had a stunt coordinator " who designed all the action , " @entity18 said			0
while quite a few of the leading actors do their own stunts , it is the stunt coordinator who must decide which stunts they can and ca n't do , he said			2
" because , as you know , if the actor gets hurt in any way , say he even breaks a finger , you 're shut down for three months , and they look at you and say ' why did you stick him in something where he can get hurt ? ' " " they 're the ones that have to tell them , ' when you stand in this spot right now your life is in my hands and i 'm telling you that you 're safe in this spot , when the cars come sliding around the corner , they are not going to hit you			0
if you stand five feet over here , it 's going to kill you , ' " @entity18 said			0
despite the support of @entity133 a-listers such as @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 and others , the politics are against the campaign for adding an @entity2 for best stunt coordinator , according to @entity31 , a journalist who has closely covered the issue			1
pressure to keep the annual @entity2 telecast entertaining and on schedule means there is a " zero chance " a best stunt @entity2 will be handed out in the live ceremony , @entity31 predicted			1
@entity18 suggested , though , the clips of the nominated stunts would liven up the telecast			2
" we do n't even care if we 're in the ceremony , " @entity18 said			0
" we just want to get that @entity2 in our hands			2
" but the governors who represent the makeup , animated shorts and sound mixing peer groups would be unlikely to vote for awarding a competitive @entity2 category off - air , @entity31 said			1
it would create a precedent that could pave the way for their @entity2 to be taken out of the telecast 's limelight , he said			1
" it 's the embedded and entrenched politics of this ancient group that is so hard to move , " @entity31 said			0
the basic problem is that it would require addition of a stunt coordinators peer group to the 16 already existing , he said			1
it would add three governors to the @entity16 's board , which with nearly 50 now is " just a nightmare , " he said			2
there is " very little payback " for the @entity16 to add a stunt coordinator @entity2 because " these are unknown people to the viewers at home that watch the show , he said			1
stunt people are not the only overlooked movie workers , @entity31 said			2
voice actors do n't have " a shot in hell " of winning a @entity2 for their performances in blockbuster animated films , he said			2
casting directors should also be honored , he said			0
stunt actors are not completely snubbed by industry award shows , though			0
the @entity195 added a " stunt ensemble " @entity195 award			0
@entity31 said the category has been " warmly received			0
" @entity18 , who was recently set on fire for an episode of tv 's " @entity201 , " said he 's hoping the @entity16 governors will also see the light and see that " without a stunt coordinator most of these big films would never be made			1
" " i worked very hard on ' @entity54 ' trying to make those physical stunts look real , and i think it paid off in what the audience came and saw , and i 'd really like to be a part of the @entity2 ceremony next year , " he said .			1
