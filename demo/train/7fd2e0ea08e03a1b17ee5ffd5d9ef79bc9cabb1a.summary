three prominent @entity1 women will make it clear to a crowd of legislators on @entity6 tuesday that a crucial measure of success in @entity1 will be what women and girls can accomplish after @entity12 troops leave			1
if a woman is free to vote and determine her own future and a girl is free to get an education , then more than 12 years of @entity12 engagement have not been in vain			2
a strong @entity1 woman is a defeat for the @entity21			0
a determined @entity1 woman who can vote will wrestle the country away from tribalism and promote democracy			1
an assertive @entity1 woman will bring back the @entity1 that once preached moderation and tolerance of all religions , a country where women were on par with men assisting in resolving political and ethical conflicts			2
but if girls are denied an education or forced into child marriages ; if talented women can not pursue their goals , then nothing will have changed for all of cost in blood and treasure the @entity12 has spent			1
the women -- @entity44 , founder of the @entity45 ; @entity46 , former @entity1 minister of women 's affairs and presidential candidate ; and @entity51 , a gender and policy adviser who ran an underground school for girls in the @entity21 era -- are warning legislators that the next two years before @entity12 forces withdraw are crucial in developing methods to empower @entity1 women and to create resilient communities			1
no time can be lost			0
already the @entity21 is regrouping and is poised to fill any power vacuum created by a weak government in @entity64			0
warlords are forming coalitions to push back on the @entity21			0
@entity1 could be heading toward civil war			0
who will bear the brunt ? women , whose rights can easily be traded off if they are not at the table when decisions are made			0
in a negotiation without women , if one side says it does n't want schools for girls because @entity78 does not permit it , the other side may say sure , no problem			2
but if women are at the negotiating table , they can make the argument forcefully that @entity78 does not ban education for girls and that , in fact , @entity78 supports it			2
@entity90 already has showed he can not be trusted to support the rights of women by signing a clerical council 's " code of conduct " for women , which , among other strictures , supports women 's segregation , bans women 's travel without a male guardian and gives husbands rights to beat their wives in certain circumstances			1
seeing this looming threat to @entity12 war aims , last week sens. @entity108 , @entity109 , and @entity110 , @entity111 , introduced the @entity112 and @entity113			0
it requires the @entity115 to produce a strategy to promote women 's security during the transfer of power to @entity1 forces			1
@entity108 said that is the only way to achieve our overall goal of a secure and stable @entity1			0
in consultation with @entity1 women , we believe four things must be done before the @entity12 loses its bargaining position in @entity1 after our troops withdraw			1
create a coalition of women leaders : a coalition of prominent @entity1 women ought to be created with the mandate of providing counsel every time an issue of women 's and girls ' rights is on the negotiating table			1
make sure women can vote : the @entity12 must make sure that @entity1 elections are not corrupt and that women actually get to vote			1
women will vote against the @entity21 if they are free to go to the polls			0
but we must have election monitors to be sure their votes are not stolen			0
imams must become advocates for women : as a deeply religious society , @entity1 must solve its problems within a framework of @entity78 beliefs			1
the people devoutly follow their imams and mullahs			0
our experience shows that through an imam training program , they can become advocates for girls ' and women 's rights			1
expanding our support for these training programs will pay big dividends			0
direct aid to support communities : billions of dollars in @entity12 aid will be squandered if @entity1 women do not believe they are integral to the political and economic process			1
we have two years to redirect part of this aid to fortify communities so that @entity1 women , imams and community leaders can resist the @entity21 on their own terms			1
if @entity1 women suffer again , it will be as if we went to war for no reason			2
we must remember that we had three objectives for launching the @entity1 war -- capturing @entity186 , defeating @entity187 and the @entity21 and protecting @entity1 women and their rights			2
if we walk away and allow @entity1 women to be subjugated , we will have made the same mistake we made after we helped the @entity191 push the @entity192 out of @entity1			2
we left the country in a power vacuum , which was filled by a radical fringe known as the @entity21			0
we know how badly that turned out .			0

@entity198 : a *key* measure of @entity12 success in @entity1 will be extent of women 's rights
@entity204 : if girls ca n't go to school , women ca n't reach goals , nothing will have changed
women must be in talks to fight forcefully for rights , she says , especially for schooling
@entity204 : women must vote , go to school , and imams must promote women 's rights
