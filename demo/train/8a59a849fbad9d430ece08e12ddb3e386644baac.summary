president @entity0 apologized thursday to those @entity1 whose insurance plans are being canceled due to the federal health law he championed even though he said repeatedly they could keep their coverage if they liked			1
" i am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me , " he told @entity7 in an exclusive interview			1
" we 've got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this , " he added			0
@entity0 's comments come days after he attempted to clarify what he meant when he assured @entity1 in previous years that they would be able to keep their plans under the @entity25 , a controversy that is prompting legislation in @entity27 to address it			1
@entity0 further alters ' you can keep your plan ' pledge @entity32 have hammered @entity0 over the promise since insurers began discontinuing coverage for some of the 12 million @entity1 who buy individual policies on the private market that do n't meet @entity25 requirements for more comprehensive care			1
@entity41 moves past troubled @entity25 website insurance companies appear to be doing this for a variety of reasons ; some are pulling all their plans from certain states where they have fewer subscribers in order to save money			1
in many cases , affected policyholders are being squeezed			0
they either do n't qualify for subsidies to lower the cost of new premiums or they may have to pay more in the health care exchange marketplace			0
when @entity0 says he 's looking to fix it , he primarily means steps that can be taken administratively , senior administration officials said			1
some experts suggest one possible approach would be to ask insurers to delay the cancellation of plans and extend them into the @entity68 so that people are not left without insurance			2
that has been done , for example , in the state of @entity74			0
but @entity76 speaker @entity75 said an @entity0 apology was in order and said the @entity41 - led @entity76 had its own plan in mind			1
" what @entity1 want to hear is that the president is going to keep his promise			2
that 's why the @entity76 will vote next week to allow anyone with a health care plan they like to keep it , " @entity75 said			1
" if the president is sincerely sorry that he misled the @entity1 people , the very least he can do is support this bipartisan effort			2
otherwise , this apology does n't amount to anything			0
" the administration eventually knew that many policies would be changed by the insurance carriers after @entity25 was introduced , and the associated political uproar since its october 1 online rollout has also angered @entity98 and fueled @entity41 efforts to extend related controversies onto the campaign trail			0
vulnerable @entity103 voice concerns in 2010 , the @entity104 estimated that 40 % to 67 % of individual plans would eventually lose their " grandfathered " status , which only was conferred if a plan was purchased before the health care law was approved in 2010			0
although @entity0 said the " buck stops " with him on @entity25 problems to date -- including the rocky rollout of the website -- he still was resolute that his initiative to provide coverage for the uninsured and better coverage for many others would be better for the country			1
" most of the folks who ... got these cancellation letters , they 'll be able to get better care at the same cost or cheaper in these new marketplaces , " @entity0 said , also noting that " we have to make sure " people do not feel as if they 've been betrayed by an effort carried out with their best interests in mind			2
" they 'll have more choice , they 'll have more competition			0
they 're part of a bigger pool			0
the insurance companies are going to be hungry for their business			0
so the majority of folks will end up being better off , " he said			0
key elements of the health law prohibit discrimination for pre-existing conditions and require new plans cover maternity care , mental health and other areas			0
the program was developed to put comprehensive care within reach of millions of uninsured @entity1			0
about 95 % of legal @entity1 residents receive health insurance through private employers or the federal government , the @entity0 administration says			1
but more than 48 million @entity1 do n't have any coverage			2
debunking 4 @entity25 myths : both sides get it wrong @entity0 's apology comes a week after similar refrains were made by vice president @entity163 and @entity165 secretary @entity164 regarding the botched @entity25 online rollout			1
five things we learned from @entity25 records @entity170 : chief tech officer too busy for congressional testimony asked if he thinks @entity1 will be able to trust what he says in the future , @entity0 said he thinks he 'll ultimately be " judged on whether " @entity25 is better for @entity1 overall			1
" when you try to do something big like make our health care system better ... there are going to be problems along the way , even if ultimately what you 're doing is going to make a whole lot of people better off , and i hope that people will look at the end product and they 're going to be able to look back and say , you know what , we now have protections we did n't have before , " he said			0
in the @entity7 interview , @entity0 reiterated the administration 's line that he 's " confident " a " majority of people " will be able to use the website and apply for insurance by november 30			1
but he did not say whether he would push back the march 31 deadline to enroll or the penalty for those who do not purchase insurance			0
@entity25 depends on younger , healthier @entity1 to buy into the program and pay premiums to offset costs for covering older people who need more health care			1
those without insurance who do not sign up for a plan face a fine			0
what else could go wrong with @entity25 ? a @entity211 poll conducted just over a week ago showed 36 % of @entity1 said they did n't think that in the long run the @entity25 would make much of a difference to their family 's health care situation			1
just over a third said the health care law would make matters worse , and one in four said that @entity25 would make things better			2
opinion : here 's the truth about @entity25			2
