@entity0 -- a @entity3 couple wants to trademark the slogan " @entity5 " with the intent to sell sweatshirts , t - shirts , bumper stickers and hobo bags , among other merchandise			1
" i 'm no marketing genius , but when you got something that 's across 50 states , it 's a brand now , " said 44 - year - old @entity12 of @entity13 , @entity0			2
@entity12 's wife , @entity19 , filed a trademark application with the @entity21 on october 18 and paid a fee of $ 975			1
the move has some @entity5 supporters perplexed			2
" the goal of @entity5 is not to become a profitable business , " said @entity25 , an @entity5 spokesman			1
" anything that misconstrues it as such , such as trademarking for the sake of profiting , is missing the point of protest			0
" but @entity12 sees things differently			2
" i 'm the best person they could imagine buying the slogan , because no one has their interest more than myself , " he said			0
" this is an important slogan ; somebody else might have gotten a hold of it			0
" a former union iron worker , @entity12 is now a stay - at - home father of three after suffering a stroke and sustaining a work injury nine years ago			2
he said he became a supporter of @entity5 once the union began backing the cause			0
" i 'm also really against corporate money distorting elections , " he said			0
@entity12 , who calls himself a " fiscally conservative but socially liberal " political independent , said his idea stemmed from creating shirts drawn with markers down on @entity5			1
but it was his wife -- whom he describes as apolitical -- who filed the application because @entity12 does not have a credit card			2
but @entity25 said @entity12 's attempt runs counter to the @entity5 mission			1
" i think they are taking what is meant to represent 99 % of @entity63 and instead making it represent an individual , " he said			0
@entity66 , an intellectual property lawyer in @entity0 , said legally , " you do n't get to own words because you think them up			1
" he said that the @entity70 ' " intent of use " application would be approved if they have a " bona fide intention " to produce items for commerce			0
it would take two to three months until the application is reviewed , at which point a separate " use " application will need to be submitted , @entity66 said			1
trademark privileges would give the @entity70 ' ownership of " @entity5 " the brand , as well as the use of such text on merchandise labels			1
@entity66 said he , too , was confused that " someone from the @entity5 gang , which has demonstrated anti-capitalist ideals , would engage in a fundamental capitalist activity , like trademarking			0
" when asked where proceeds would go , @entity12 said , " it 's my intent to have them ( @entity5 supporters ) get the maximum benefit possible after any expenses			2
" while @entity12 said it was too soon to make any promises , " it is my hope to transfer ownership of the trademark to @entity5 if it 's feasible			1
" he said he would even sell the trademark to @entity5 members , if they wanted it , for just $ 1 -- after they repaid his expenses			1
@entity25 said he does n't think fellow @entity5 protesters will be too eager to don trademarked " @entity5 " clothing			0
" we already make t - shirts down there for free , screen - printing on site , " he said			0
" we think that organic individual marketing -- making our own buttons or t - shirts -- is more valuable			0
