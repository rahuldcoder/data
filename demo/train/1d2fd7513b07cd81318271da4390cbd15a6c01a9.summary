-- talk about wasted energy			2
after all the shouting and handwringing , what president @entity4 appears prepared to do over the next few days to fix some of what 's broken with the immigration system is n't likely to have much effect at all			1
his right - wing opponents act as if what he 's planning will lead to an apocalypse , while his supporters seem determined to oversell it as some sort of new @entity16			1
the truth is very different			2
there are a few reasons why : for a start , there are an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the @entity23 , and less than half would be covered by what @entity4 has in mind			1
and on top of that , if the experience with @entity29 is any guide , only about a third of those eligible will find the courage to come out of the shadows and accept the administration 's offer			2
besides , the executive action probably wo n't take effect for about six months , which will give @entity39 in @entity41 time to stop beating their chests and start passing legislation that makes permanent changes , the sort that would render the executive action meaningless			2
meanwhile , during all this , deportations of the less fortunate would continue , and might even be ramped up			1
it hardly seems surprising then that the major networks are reportedly not going to be airing the president 's speech when he delivers it at 8 pm et. ( although spanish language channel @entity53 is expected to break into its coverage of the @entity56 for the speech )			0
@entity4 is scheduled to follow up the address with a trip to @entity60 on friday , where he 'll flesh out the details of what he has in mind during a visit to @entity66 , a location that will bring the president full circle -- it was at this school last year that @entity4 laid out his vision for comprehensive immigration reform			1
over the weekend , @entity4 will make the rounds of spanish - language media			1
there , he 'll try to persuade @entity77 voters -- 70 % of whom supported his reelection in 2012 -- that he does n't deserve the moniker of " deporter - in - chief			1
" of course he can hardly be surprised this is the way @entity77 voters see him : that 's the reputation you get when your administration deports 2 million people in five years , divides hundreds of thousands of families , and reportedly sends thousands of @entity23 - born children to foster care after they were left behind when their undocumented parents were deported			1
all this has n't stopped @entity4 's opponents on the right portraying him as @entity98 for the undocumented , a bizarre interpretation of reality given the last five years of removals			1
of course , we all know what 's behind this portrayal : it 's meant to stir up fear , anger , and anxiety			0
and , sure enough , it 's working			0
ignorance has the power to do that			0
in fact , it 's really startling how the immigration issue can make smart people say dumb things			2
just a few days ago , @entity117 , the @entity118 columnist , insisted that @entity4 wants to " rewrite " immigration laws through his executive action			1
@entity117 does n't get it			0
but he is not alone			0
@entity4 is n't " rewriting " anything , but simply applying discretion in enforcing the law			1
let me explain : when a policeman pulls you over for speeding , but he lets you off with a warning , he did n't " rewrite " the traffic laws			0
he merely used his discretion to not give you a ticket , probably so he can focus his time and resources on more egregious offenders			0
it 's this kind of discretion that is at the heart of what @entity4 intends to do about immigration			1
not only is it not " illegal " as alarmists on the right have prematurely characterized @entity4 's planned executive action , it 's standard operating procedure in @entity23 's criminal justice system			1
in fact , much of what the president is said to be considering seems tame and , dare i say it , conservative			0
besides the fact that not many people will apply or qualify for this relief , it 's also not the equivalent of permanent legal residency			0
no president can confer that , despite what clueless right - wing pundits are saying about how @entity4 is handing out " amnesty			1
" this is n't overreach by the president -- in fact , some on the left will consider it underachieving			0
still , mr. president , an explanation of what type of executive action you plan to take would be nice			2
after all , you 've made a mess of the discussion so far , even as you poisoned the nation 's overall immigration debate			2
and you 've reminded us that , when the nation is starved of principled leadership on a tough moral issue , broken promises and flip - flopping and stall tactics and finger pointing are left to fill the gap			2
while you 're setting the record straight about what actions you intend to take and who will benefit , you should also do something that you are probably reluctant to do : you need to level with immigrant advocates about how , no matter what you say or do , deportations of illegal immigrants will likely continue at the same pace that they have throughout your administration			2
after all , no one is debating whether individuals who are here without the proper documents should be removed			0
last year , for example , @entity206 reported that @entity208 has established a yearly quota of 400,000 deportations			2
and although @entity208 has denied there is such a quota , the agency has miraculously managed to hit that figure , or get very close to it			0
so we have a pretty good idea that this is going to continue no matter what @entity4 says tonight from the @entity220 , or tomorrow from @entity60 , or on spanish - language media in the days to come			1
the fact is that the deportation machine is unlikely to be toyed with , and that 400,000 removals per year will likely become the new normal			0
why ? because like any self - sustaining government bureaucracy , @entity208 justifies its funding level by how much it does			1
and , if it does less , it could lose some of that funding to another agency			0
the same goes for @entity23 attorney 's offices around the country that prosecute the people that @entity208 apprehends			0
bureaucrats are people , too			0
they want job security just like the rest of us , especially in a shaky job market			0
so if the administration is n't deporting one group of people , then it will focus on another			0
so , however much manufactured outrage we hear from @entity4 's opponents on the right in the coming days , the fact remains that the " business " of our nation 's immigration enforcement agency is deporting illegal immigrants			1
and no matter what executive action @entity4 takes , when the smoke clears and tempers cool , it 'll be business as usual .			1

@entity257 : @entity4 immigration plan unlikely to bring *big* changes
@entity4 has reputation as " @entity262 " with @entity77 voters , he says
deportations have their own self - sustaining bureaucracy : @entity257
