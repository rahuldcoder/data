-- you 've just finished a round of golf on a floating course in the middle of the @entity6			1
an underwater tunnel leads you to the clubhouse , where a glass elevator drops down to a main bar that doubles as a spectacular natural aquarium			2
it might sound far - fetched , but a $ 500 million development in the @entity14 is set to make the world 's biggest water hazard a reality -- and at the same time offer a potential long - term solution to the threat of climate change in the area			1
designed by floating architecture specialists @entity24 , the proposed site is just a five - minute speedboat ride from @entity14 capital male , and will offer 27 holes of golf , set upon three interlinked islands			1
the government - approved development will also boast around 200 villas , 45 private islands and a conservation center -- and all at little or no cost to the wildlife - rich coral reefs it will call home , according to the people behind it			1
" we told the president of the @entity14 we can transform you from climate refugees to climate innovators , " said @entity41 , ceo of @entity42			1
" and we have a way of building and sustaining this project that is environmentally friendly too			2
this is going to be an exclusively green development in a marine - protected area			2
" with over 80 percent of their 1,190 coral reef islands no more than a meter above sea level , the @entity14 government is at the forefront of the battle against climate change			1
as sea levels reach dangerous levels , one option is to build defense walls , as they have around @entity65			1
another is to buy land from other countries and effectively move their population to other areas			0
the third is to live on floating landscapes			2
" climate change is upon us and the @entity14 are feeling it most			1
that 's why they 're leading the way in trying to find a way to combat the problem			0
" said @entity81 , senior marine scientist at the @entity82			0
" but building on floating islands clearly comes with a risk of pollution			1
golf courses need pesticides and you need to deal with that properly to make sure it does n't get into the ocean			2
there 's also the issue of desalinating the water to irrigate the course			0
that has to be done cleanly too			0
" @entity24 @entity24 appear to have a green solution			0
they plan to capture pesticides in concrete troughs , and recycle them in a fresh water " sweet lakes " in the middle of the golf course afterwards			2
that same water will then be used to irrigate the course			0
when it comes to the environmental cost of constructing the islands and developments in the first place , the solution is far more straightforward			2
" we 'll be building the islands somewhere else , probably in the @entity120 or in @entity121 , " said designer @entity114 , the man whose vision will be realized when work officially starts on the project later this year			1
" that way there 's no environmental cost to the @entity14			1
when it comes to the golf course , the islands will be floated into position first , and then the grass will be seeded and the trees planted afterwards			1
" @entity131 , who will be lending their expertise to the project in designing the course itself , stressed the economic benefits that could result from the construction in a release issued from their headquarters in @entity141 , @entity142			0
" the scar less development , which has zero footprint on the @entity14 region will include state - of - the - art golf courses that look set to bring a wealth of new tourism and investment to the country , " said managing director @entity143			1
but @entity81 is not getting carried away			0
with some of the world 's most valuable coral reef real estate at stake , he plans to watch the development closely and treat all environmental claims with caution			1
" i just hope the @entity14 government have been wise enough to not just fall for rhetoric , " he said			1
" in an ideal world a development like this would be on land , but the world is changing			0
i just hope they get it right			0
if they do , this type of development could be a harbinger of things to come			0
" if things go to plan , @entity176 expects the golf course to be ready for play by the end of 2013 , will the full development set to launch in 2015			2
and he 's in no doubt visiting golfers will be in for a treat			0
" this will be the first and only floating golf course in the world , and it comes with spectacular ocean views on every hole , " he said			1
" and then there 's the clubhouse			0
you get in an elevator and go underwater to get to it			0
it 's like being @entity196 down there			0

a $ 500 million floating golf *complex* development is planned for the @entity14
the golf course will be laid out on three islands , connected by underwater tunnels
the project plans to use an array of *techniques* to protect the environment
floating islands could be the *future* of the @entity14 , with sea levels rising
