@entity0 -- if you call your office it department , find someone to develop your website or browse in a computer store , chances are you 'll be dealing with a man			1
so where are all the women ? in the @entity13 , women make up just 18 % of the it professional workforce , according to e-skills , the sector skills council			1
@entity16 , founder of recruitment and career development agency @entity17 , says employers are crying out for more women in their technology teams			1
yet a survey of women in working in technology published by her organization in 2011 found many felt they hit a glass ceiling and were being passed over for promotion in favor of male colleagues			1
almost two - thirds of respondents had more than 10 years experience in the technology sector , yet only 26 % have reached senior management or board level			1

get out there technology recruiters would love to take on more women , but ca n't do so if they do n't see your cv , says @entity41			1
so be more speculative and apply for jobs that stretch you a bit			2
" women will look at a job specification and feel they have to be able to do 100 % before they apply , " said @entity41			2
" men are much more speculative and will apply even if they ca n't do it all			0
" women need to grasp the interest and be more ambitious in putting themselves forward for jobs or for promotion			1
" almost 90 % of the respondents to the women in technology survey said they would need to fulfill three - quarters of the job description before applying for a job			1
@entity41 said firms could help by reducing the long list of job requirements in advertisements that could be putting women off applying			2
self - promotion is ok the relatively small number of women working in technology should mean it 's easier for them to build a profile , according to @entity41 , but in reality the opposite is often true			1
" if you look at technology conference lineups , the speakers are almost all men , " said @entity41			2
" women spend a lot of time keeping their heads down and getting their jobs done			1
" your technical skills might speak for themselves , but to get on you really need to focus on promoting yourself : speaking at events , taking any opportunity to let people know what you 're doing			2

find a sponsor a mentor , someone more experienced in your industry , who can advise you on career choices is invaluable , says @entity41			1
even better is finding a sponsor -- someone within your company who will root for you , promote your work and push you for promotion			2
@entity41 said : " women tend to be good at finding mentors , but not so many have sponsors , who will speak up for them and actively work to progress their careers			1
" women can feel quite isolated as they might be the only female in their department or team , so it is very powerful to have people looking out for you			2
" among the responses given in the women in technology survey was that more female mentors and role models were needed in schools and universities to encourage more girls into it			1
get networking and no , we 're not talking about computer networks			0
the more people you know in your sector , the more people you can call on for help when you need it			0
" networking is something you need to do right from the start of your career			0
it should be part and parcel of your professional life , " said @entity41			2
" you could join a professional body , a specific network for your specialism or something locally where you live			0
" you need as many people as you can to call on for advice			0

do n't act like a man women who responded to the survey were almost equally divided on whether they felt showing male characteristics helped them at work			0
" i would like to think women can progress without having to act like one of the boys			0
whatever the culture of a workplace , it 's important to be authentic to yourself			0
" the majority of respondents said that other women see working in technology as ' geeky '			1
while many said that they do not mind being labeled as geeks , they fear the nerdy image needs to change to attract more young women into the industry			0
keep in touch if you have a career break the technology industries lose a huge number of talented women who find it hard to get back in after a career break with children , says @entity41			1
" technology is changing so quickly with new releases and new software , so it 's really important to keep your skills up to date			0
" there are no easy answers , and it 's a big problem for the industry			0
i would like to see employers running ' return to work ' schemes to help women get their skills back up to date after a career break			0
" it would help them harvest that talent and would help everyone , but it needs investment			0
" one comment from @entity41 's survey may ring true for many women with children : " the male bosses had no sympathy or understanding towards working mothers			0
