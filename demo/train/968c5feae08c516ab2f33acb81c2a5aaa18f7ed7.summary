@entity0 -- @entity2 identifies as an atheist and wants the world , or at least the car behind her , to know it			2
but the state of @entity8 says no. @entity2 , of @entity9 , is suing the @entity10 for rejecting her request for a vanity license plate reading " @entity13 , " according to a formal complaint filed thursday with the district court			1
but the commission nixed her request , saying the message " may carry connotations offensive to good taste and decency , " according to the complaint			2
an @entity24 legal team is now helping her sue the commission claiming @entity2 's first amendment rights were violated			1
" the state of @entity8 is favoring religion while disparaging nonbelief , " said the rev. @entity27 , executive director of the group			1
" it simply has no right to do that			0
" @entity2 claims that she was denied a license plate for " @entity13 " but approved for one that read " baptist " and that this " expresses a preference for theistic religious beliefs , over non-theistic beliefs " according to the complaint			1
this case is all too familiar to another @entity8 native , @entity42 , who had to petition for a vanity license plate announcing his atheistic views			1
after he was initially rejected for a plate reading , " @entity46 , " @entity42 filed a formal complaint with the @entity10			1
he says that within three days , a supervisor at the commission issued him the plate			2
" the word ' atheist , ' in my opinion , is not objectionable , " @entity42 , who is president of @entity51 , told @entity1			0
" it 's not a bad word and should n't be regarded as a bad word			0
" he takes issue with the process , saying that it 's problematic that atheists have to jump through hoops only to be denied , then have to appeal before their license plates get approved			0
calls to the @entity10 were not immediately returned			0
pastor tries atheism , loses jobs , gains $ 19,000 can atheist churches last ? @entity69 gets her day at the @entity71			0
