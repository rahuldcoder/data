-- @entity1 is days away from getting a new president , though seemingly much longer from securing a lasting peace -- as demonstrated yet again thursday , with its military and separatists continuing to face off in eastern and southern parts of the country			1
as has been true for weeks , the deadly clashes are centered in the @entity10 and @entity11 regions			1
pro-russian separatists have seized two military bases , and civilian deaths have been reported			0
@entity16 troops on thursday blocked the main road between the cities of @entity11 and @entity19 , a hotbed for separatists			1
@entity19 itself appeared relatively calm , though there was a real potential the area could erupt at any moment with military and separatist positions separated by less than 1 kilometer			2
in nearby @entity29 , a @entity1 flag flew over @entity30 after government troops took over that community from separatist forces			2
this turnover followed two days of heavy fighting , with residents reporting they heard firing overnight			0
still , any celebration had to be muted by the fact that militants remain close by , dug in on a main road several miles east of the city			1
these tensions simmered while , hundreds of miles away in @entity43 , @entity44 , the situation in @entity1 dominated a meeting of @entity48 leaders			0
@entity50 president @entity49 threatened more economic sanctions against @entity52 -- which many in the @entity54 accuse of fomenting instability and violence in @entity1 by allowing weapons into the region and supporting separatists -- unless it takes key steps in the coming weeks			2
@entity49 warns @entity52 about continued meddling those include recognizing @entity64 , who recently won the first national election since the unrest began last november , as @entity1 's president when he is inaugurated saturday			1
until now , the @entity68 has refused to recognize the legitimacy of the @entity71 - based government that took over after the ouster of then - president @entity73			0
neither @entity64 nor his @entity52 counterpart , @entity74 , ruled out the possibility of meeting when they are in @entity77 over the coming days			0
if they do , they 'll have their work cut out for them , given the deep divisions about what 's happened in @entity1 and what should happen next			0
still , the two countries appear to be coming together at least in one respect : @entity52 's ambassador to @entity1 , @entity87 , will attend @entity64 's inauguration , according to state - run @entity89			1
" [ @entity87 ] is returning to @entity71 in order to continue executing his functions , " added @entity52 foreign ministry spokesman @entity90			0
