saturday 's downhill at @entity5 is the jewel in the @entity8 calendar , the winner meriting legendary status in the alpine annals			1
like any budding skier , @entity9 had always dreamed of triumphing at the foot of @entity14 's @entity13 mountain but instead , six years ago , he lay face down on the snow , out cold within meters of the finish line			1
online footage of the crash -- memorable to everyone except @entity9 who can not remember anything from the day before the incident to three weeks hence -- is not for the faint - hearted			1
at the time , he had been the rising star of @entity24 skiing with four @entity8 wins to his name and a solitary world title -- the 2007 @entity27			1
on a training run with the finish line in sight , he approached the final jump			1
a minor error on his part -- exacerbated by the fact he was traveling at 140 kph ( 87 mph ) -- saw his skis flap wildly out of control as he battled to regain his balance for 40 meters in the air before landing heavily on his back			2
@entity9 suffered a brain injury and a bruised lung , was airlifted to hospital and placed in a coma for three weeks to give both his brain and lung the best chance of recovery			1
" it was a hard time , " he recalls			2
" you have to learn your name , your age , all this stuff			0
" his first memory was of a hospital ceiling and it was three weeks after regaining consciousness that he once again remembered his name and the fact he had been a top skier			0
" the last memory i have is from the day before			0
the feeling was great because the slope was in good shape and i was fast in first training and i was skiing easily			0
i knew that i was going to be fast in this race			0
then , yeah , it was too fast ! " @entity9 is able to laugh as he retells the incident , in part helped by the fact he has no recall of the savage beating he took on the final meters of the @entity5 course even after watching it back on a few occasions			1
to him , it is as though he is watching someone else 's dramatic and sudden alpine downfall , and without emotion			1
" if i watch myself in @entity5 then i feel like it was n't me because i do n't have any memory of him			1
i know that he was me , i see that it was me but , for me , it was not a person			0
i was out of my body			0
" in the early weeks of his recovery from his brain trauma he did not have the strength to even feed himself			1
however , slowly but surely he got up to speed although he admits " i have something [ his brain ] that does n't work so good like before			1
so i 'm always in recovery			0
" today , he gets tired quicker and his temper frays more readily than prior to the accident			1
but remarkably , it did not end his career , rather it was a dislocated left kneecap after crashing in another training run at @entity99 , @entity100 in november 2012 that finally called time on his professional career on the slopes			2
amazingly , it was just a week after being released from the neurological unit that cared for him that he was back skiing despite the inherent dangers of the sport			0
" the first time i was on skis , i thought ' okay , shit , this is a nice feeling , i wan na go back in the @entity8 ' , " he recalls			1
" i got down okay [ the first time ] but it was not so easy because then when i see i have to make a turn and then the brain had to tell the knee what to do			2
everything was in slow motion			0
" slow as the process may have seemed initially , within two years , he was back on the @entity8 circuit although not quite the same force he previously was			1
there were to be no further @entity8 wins , not that he minded enormously			1
he still recalls the feeling of being in the start gate for that first race back : " it was a great feeling			0
i was a bit nervous			0
then i told me , okay , it 's the first race , just ski easily			2
then it was so good , the feeling was so great and i was also fast			0
" on his return to the sport , the doctors had warned him he might suffer headaches at altitude			0
he was also warned about the perilous nature of another knock to the head			0
" @entity140 is dangerous and it 's always going to be in a little way dangerous			2
but if you are a skier , if you are a pro , if you 're the downhill , it 's not so dangerous because you know what you can do , you know how it works and , for us , @entity5 , when you ski it 's easy			1
" persuading his family , his wife in particular , of that fact was the harder part but , in the end , they knew they could not stand in the way of his desire and the thing that made him tick as a human being			0
the return was relatively short - lived , his knee putting pay to his ambitions to once more get to the very top of the sport			2
having his career cut short was hard			0
" my body told me that ' no , it 's over now			2
you came back , you were in the @entity8 again , you did it , you have you 're whole life in front of you '			1
" now , he runs his own clothes line , @entity175 , and also mentors young skiers giving the 30 - year - old a new career in the sport			1
part of him , the racer within , would like to be in that start gate to tackle the slope on which he was lucky to survive			0
but he 's just happy to have had a second chance at life .			2

it is six years since @entity9 suffered brain trauma on the @entity5 downhill
remarkably , he returned from the injury to the @entity8 circuit two years after the event
on the eve of the @entity5 downhill , he relives an accident he remembers nothing about
today , he has his own clothing line and mentor 's up - and - coming skiers
