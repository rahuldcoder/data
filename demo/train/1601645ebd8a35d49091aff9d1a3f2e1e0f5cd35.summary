@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity6 opposition leader @entity5 will make her first trip outside the country in more than two decades when she visits @entity1 next week to attend a regional conference , a spokesman for her party said thursday			1
@entity5 , a pro-democracy campaigner who endured years of house arrest under @entity6 's military rulers , will travel to the @entity1 capital of @entity0 on monday where she will participate in the @entity13 on @entity14 , said @entity15 , a spokesman for the @entity16			1
the visit to @entity0 comes ahead of a longer trip to @entity19 next month during which @entity5 will make a series of key addresses , including the acceptance speech for the @entity23 that she was prevented from collecting in 1991 because she was in detention			1
@entity15 and the organizers of the @entity13 declined to give more information about what part @entity5 would play at the @entity0 conference			2
president @entity30 of @entity6 , the former military official whose civilian government has instituted many of the country 's recent political reforms , is also scheduled to attend the forum			1
@entity5 and 33 other newly elected members of her party took up their seats in the @entity6 parliament at the start of this month , a historic step for the country 's progress toward democracy			1
in the past 12 months , @entity30 's government has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners , secured a cease - fire with @entity48 rebels and agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups			0
those steps , as well as the by - elections last month where the @entity16 won nearly every seat it contested , have been applauded by the @entity53 , @entity54 and other governments			0
they have responded by easing sanctions on @entity6 , which is also known as @entity6			0
@entity5 's first speaking engagement in @entity19 next month is an address at a conference in @entity61 , @entity62 , organized by the @entity63 on june 14			1

while there , she will address both houses of the @entity69 parliament on june 21 , a rare honor for foreign dignitaries			0
the relatively successful elections and @entity5 's freedom to travel contrast starkly with the situation in the country at the start of the 1990s			0
@entity5 led her party to a landslide victory in 1990 , the previous time @entity6 had held multiparty elections			1
but the military junta ignored the results and kept her under house arrest			2
@entity6 's economy stagnated and its people lived under repressive rule until the military began to allow the fledgling reforms of the past two years			2
the progress the country has experienced recently in nonetheless qualified by ongoing violence between government forces and some ethnic rebels , reports of voting irregularities in the by - elections last month and the military - backed ruling group 's overwhelming control of parliament			0
the @entity107 secretary - general , @entity106 , noted ahead of a visit to the country last month that @entity6 's " fresh start is still fragile			2
" @entity2 's @entity111 contributed to this report .			0

@entity5 will visit @entity19 next month to make several speeches
she will also travel to @entity1 next week for a regional conference
