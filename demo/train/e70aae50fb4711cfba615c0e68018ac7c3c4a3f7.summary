-- @entity1 , the mother of swimming star @entity2 , who won a record eight gold medals in @entity4 , is the author of a new memoir , " a mother for all seasons			1
" @entity1 , mother of olympian @entity2 , tells @entity8 her son has strong values			1
@entity1 spoke with @entity0 's @entity8 about her new book , a recent tabloid report detailing her son 's partying ways and the infamous bong photo			1
the following is an edited version of the transcript			2
@entity8 : you have this terrific new book coming			2
if i do say so myself , it 's inspiring			2
yet ( thursday 's ) lead story in the " @entity24 " gate crasher column -- i do n't know who writes that -- " tsk , tsk , " it says , " @entity2 , partying your face off in public is not the way to reclaim your good guy image			1
the @entity2 was been laying relatively low since his bong smoking scandal in january was out in full force tuesday night at @entity37 hot spot @entity35 " -- i think is the name -- " @entity2 was definitely having a good time , an eyewitness tells us , drinking straight from a bottle of @entity43			1
when the @entity44 started playing @entity46 's ' @entity45 , ' he got up started dancing like a loon and kept on yelling ' shots			2
' @entity1 definitely had enough alcohol on hand for several four round			1
he ordered four bottles of vodka			2
" is this tough for a mother ? how do you react ? @entity1 : it 's one thing that i learn at a very early age is i do n't get caught up in gossip columns			1
he has great values , lots of integrity			2
that 's what i think about that			2
@entity8 : did you talk to him about this ? @entity1 : i always talk to @entity2			1
i talk to @entity2 every day			1
we talked about training today and things of that nature			2
@entity8 : but it would be normal to say , what happened , would n't it ? i would say that to my son			1
@entity1 : we give support			1
we give an ear to listen			2
and , again , i do n't get caught up in gossip			1
@entity8 : therefore , you do n't believe it ? i just want to establish what your feelings are			1
@entity1 : i do n't get caught up in gossip , mr. @entity8			1
@entity8 : what about something that was n't gossip , the picture with the bong thing			1
@entity1 : it 's a picture , that 's true			1
but , you know , a picture can say many things			2
it has many visualizations that you want to think			2
it depends on the person who is looking at that picture			0
you know , as a mom , i support all three of my children			0
i believe that no matter who you are in this country , in this world , there are obstacles that get into your life			0
i call them speed bumps in school sometimes			0
i heard someone say lightning bolts			0
that 's another term for that			0
but , you know , how do we grow ? how do we learn ? you raise a child through 18			0
you send them off to college			0
you give them the roots			0
you give them the foundation to be a strong , young man , a strong lady			0
life throws curve balls to you sometimes			0
how do you handle that curve ball ? @entity8 : @entity2 is 23			1
@entity1 : a young adult			1
so one could say it 's his life			0
he chooses to lead it			0
as our parent , we do our best to guide them , but 23 is 23			0
do you view him still as a kid ? @entity1 : i view my 31 - year - old daughter as a kid sometimes			1
you know , i look at each of my children independently and individually of themselves			0
they have many strong values , strong points , professionalism			0
i 'm just very proud of all three of them and everything they 've done			0
@entity8 : do you think these kind of stories -- and you do n't pay attention to them -- hurt your book ? @entity1 : i was asked many times and told many times , " @entity1 , you need to write a book some day			1
" as an educator , i 'm thinking , i would really like to do that			0
it became a personal goal of mine to be able to publish a book , not knowing exactly what it was going to be			0
was it going to be my life ? was it going to be parenting ? was it going to be swimming ? was it just going to be motivational and inspirational ? when i take a look at the book i was able to write , i have great pride in that book because it shows other people , every woman , but not even women -- men can read this book also -- the inspiration and motivation of life			1
@entity8 : the question is , " do you think these kind of stories might hurt the chance of people buying the book , which is what you want ? " @entity1 : people are going to have to make that decision			1
@entity8 : do you think it might ? @entity1 : life is life			1
i do want to say , though , in reference to the @entity215 , we , as a family , i think , made a great impression on the world , on the @entity220			0
my son has great love for me			1
it 's a great bonding relationship			0
@entity8 : is he still a role model , do you think ? @entity1 : you know , when i think of the word role model , i 'll go back to me being a little girl			1
it was my mom and my dad			0
they were my role models when i was growing up			0
when i hear that role model in a sentence with my son , what i think about with @entity2 is what he does with and for children			1
it might be things people do n't even know of -- his association with the @entity242			2
for years , he has done that ( and ) his association with @entity245			0
he touches kids ' lives			0
so if an individual , wherever they may be , may select my son as a role model , i say that my son has strong values			2
i say he 's a human being			0
and i say that from obstacles that get in people 's ways -- we all have them , mr. @entity8 , and you know that -- what do you learn from them and how do you rise above the occasion ?			0
