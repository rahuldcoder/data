-- in 1961 , my senior year in a rural @entity4 high school , i competed in the oratorical contest with a speech titled , " the plight of the @entity8			2
" my teacher informed me if i wanted to win , i had chosen a wrong and contentious topic			0
while i was raised in the @entity13 , attitudes about @entity12 were similar to those in the @entity15			1
from a relatively inactive movement in early 1960 , dramatic events for racial equality captured national attention between 1961 and 1963 -- @entity20 , @entity22 's desegregation order , @entity23 , integration of the @entity25 , gov. @entity27 's intervention against desegregating the @entity28 , dr. @entity29 , national awareness of @entity32 and @entity34 brutality			1
when i arrived in the capital as a college student to take summer classes in 1963 , i heard about a national demonstration planned at the @entity39 for late august			0
@entity40 was not only below the @entity42 line , but it was then in many ways a outhern city			1
few blacks attended @entity40 's white colleges and universities			1
at my college , there were two black undergraduates , one of whom was from @entity56			0
job opportunities for non-college educated blacks were mostly in servile roles			0
college educated blacks were principally offered positions as teachers in colored public schools and ministers in colored churches			0
the @entity68 administration , fearing unrest , discouraged the demonstration			0
lead organizers @entity72 and openly gay @entity73 were not deterred			2
on wednesday , august 28 , 1963 , i joined an estimated 250,000 black and some white @entity74 at the @entity39 for the @entity75			0
for me , it was important that i attend			0
being a @entity78 , the @entity77 was a recent and painful reminder of unfettered prejudice			0
@entity12 lynchings without arrests reminded me of the horror of the pogroms that @entity84 experienced in @entity85 , while authorities looked the other way			0
the march was a magical moment			1
ordinary folks , mostly dressed as if they were going to church arrived from rural towns and large cities			0
despite the repression exercised by authorities in the @entity15 , they were not intimidated			0
the magnitude of the largest crowd ever assembled on the @entity97 inspired everyone			2
the statue of the @entity100 symbolized the long sought aspirations for a better life , equality and equal justice			0
it was a hot day with lots of speeches			0
while dr. @entity110 is recognized today as @entity74 's preeminent civil rights leader , his numerous co-organizers also spoke that day			1
one was rabbi @entity112 , president of the @entity113			0
jews were among the early white supporters of civil rights			2
rabbi @entity112 was a @entity118 jew who emigrated to the @entity74 to escape @entity120 persecution			0
his speech lived up to his honored placement between @entity124 's spirituals and dr. @entity110 's speech			1
when dr. @entity110 began " @entity127 , " i was struck as if by lightning			1
it was akin to hearing @entity130 speak to the heavens			0
his speech was a defining moment for those assembled and for @entity74 watching television in living rooms across the nation			2
the march led to a @entity137 and a @entity138			2
in the late 1980s , i came out as a gay man and became increasingly involved in @entity141 civil rights			1
i met @entity142 and @entity143 , the mother and father of the @entity141 civil rights movement			2
they helped organize the @entity148 at @entity149 and @entity150 each july 4 from 1965 to 1969			0
the @entity148 , the first organized demonstrations for gay equality , laid the groundwork for the @entity154 in 1969			2
while working on " @entity155 , " a documentary to chronicle this history , i learned that the march on @entity40 had empowered early gay activists			1
they followed dr. @entity110 's protocol of non-violence , decorum and picketing			1
it informed me of the march 's pivotal impact on gay activism			1
gay pioneer @entity172 stated , " we had marched with @entity110 , seven of us from the @entity173 of @entity40 in 1963 , and from that time on , we 'd always had our dream about a ( gay ) march of similar proportions			1
" the first @entity174 on july 4 , 1965 , in @entity175 had 40 participants			0
it was the largest demonstration for gay equality in the history of the world			1
by the @entity182 , the number swelled to 160 picketers			0
from 1979 to 1993 , a series of national marches on @entity40 for lesbian and gay rights drew , at first , tens of thousands and later hundreds of thousands of people -- culminating in the april 1993 march on @entity40 for @entity188 , @entity172 and @entity189 that attracted an estimated 1 million demonstrators			1
in the years between the 1963 march on @entity40 and 1993 , the @entity192 epidemic and societal changes propelled by the african - american and women 's civil rights movements helped launch @entity141 from nascent to engaged activism			1
for me , the march 50 years ago was a transcendent moment in a lifelong engagement for everyone 's civil rights			1
on august 28 , 1963 , dr. @entity110 ascended a @entity204			1
his biblical dream forever changed institutional oppression , our nation and the world			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity212 .			1

@entity212 grew up in the segregated world of the @entity13
he says the march on @entity40 was a " magical moment "
@entity212 : @entity110 's words inspired *broader* rights movements
he says that from 1979 to 1993 , *protests* for gay rights grew ever larger , *stronger*
