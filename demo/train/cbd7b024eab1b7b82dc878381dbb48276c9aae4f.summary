-- which politician do you hate ? do you think president @entity3 wants to destroy @entity4 ? or do you believe former president @entity5 is the one who sent the country into the abyss ? what about @entity9 , @entity10 or @entity11 -- which one of them do you think is the devil incarnate ? @entity4 , disgusted by the failures in @entity16 , have increasingly resorted to personalizing the blame , drawing imaginary bull 's - eyes and throwing figurative darts at the faces of the politicians whose views they disagree with , all the while fantasizing about throwing the people they despise out of political office			1
unfortunately , the problem goes much deeper than a few individuals , however incompetent or despicable : throw out the ones you hate , and you 'll get new ones to blame , because the problems will not disappear without repairing the flaws in the system that brought the country to this embarrassing and self - destructive place			1
the people are rightly fed up			1
in the middle of the just - ended federal shutdown , polls showed most @entity4 blamed the mess on @entity42 , but approval for the entire @entity44 , which has @entity45 as well as @entity42 , sank to an incredible 5 %			1
the prevailing sentiment was revulsion			0
the question , however , is not how awful the politicians are			2
the question is why @entity4 voters ended up with representatives whose performance they find so thoroughly reprehensible			1
the answer to that question provides a path to solving the problem			0
the problem is not just that the nation has divided and moved into partisan echo chambers , where everyone listens only to the people with whom they agree			2
each side listens to its own favorite commentators on television and radio ; each follows like - minded thinkers on @entity70 and @entity71			2
in that system , the most vitriolic speech is the most highly rewarded			2
moderate @entity4 have less tantalizing things to say			1
if you think the other side is driven only by selfish motives or by nefarious goals , you will find a willing , enthusiastic and fast - growing audience			2
but if you believe that the differences stem from different life experiences and honest philosophical disagreements and if you believe that @entity42 and @entity45 want what is best for the country but have distinct ideas about what that means or how to achieve it , your views will get little traction in this emotionally charged environment			0
the irony is that those moderate views represent @entity4 most faithfully			1
a recent poll by @entity96 and @entity97 concluded that most @entity4 are social and political centrists , in sharp contrast to the clashes of extremes that we see in the media , on the @entity103 and in @entity44			1
the poll showed the majority supports same - sex marriage , legal marijuana , paid maternity leave , child care subsidies to help new mothers get back to work , a higher minimum wage and paid sick leave			2
but a majority also supports the death penalty , offshore drilling and the end of affirmative action in hiring and education			0
this is not the picture of an extremist country			0
it 's the picture of a nation trying to come to grips with difficult questions			0
that , of course , is not how @entity44 looks			0
there , everyone seems absolutely certain on every issue , even if certainty is something that should elude us all frequently if we are honest about our human limitations			0
so how did we end up with a @entity44 that looks so different from @entity4 ? one of the main reasons is voter apathy			1
most voters are paying attention right now , horrified by the spectacle put on by their representatives			2
but when the time comes for choosing those representatives , particularly during midterms and local elections , they become distracted , leaving the job to the zealots , those people who care most passionately about politics and are most closely affiliated with activist political groups			1
as a result , whichever side is most energized -- often the one feeling most aggrieved -- manages to mobilize for the low - turnout elections			1
in 2010 , the flames of hatred against @entity3 burned hot , just as they had once burned against @entity5 on the other side of the political spectrum			1
the 2010 election not only took more right - wing republicans to @entity16 , it also gave them historic gains in state legislatures			2
local control of legislatures has allowed the parties to sharpen their gerrymandering pens -- drawing safe congressional districts that all but guarantee re-election			0
americans may want to fire all of @entity44 , but they do n't want to fire their own representative			0
that means there is little incentive to compromise			0
inflexible politicians are rewarded by voters , and the country suffers			2
not only is the government not providing the best possible solutions for @entity4 's problems , it is , in fact , creating new problems , causing unemployment			1
just as the @entity4 economy managed to pull out of recession , the politicians put their shoulder to the wheel and pushed in the wrong direction			1
the shutdown that just ended and the flirtation with the potential disaster of running against the debt ceiling are the latest chapter in a long - running political soap opera			1
it might be entertaining if it were n't so damaging			0
according to one study , the fiscal standoffs since 2009 have lowered growth by 0.3 % of gdp each year , amounting by some calculations , to $ 700 billion in lost gdp			0
among other costs , that means 900,000 jobs lost			0
the shutdown has cost @entity4 in global leadership , a loss it wo n't soon recover			1
and now that the two sides have finally reached a deal to reopen the government , the agreement is good for just three months			0
that means more uncertainty , more government - made pushback against recovery and job creation , more talented federal employees deciding they 've had enough of working for an employer that suddenly tells them " do n't come to work tomorrow , even if you want to			0
" centrists , the majority of the country , would help @entity4 simply by speaking out as forcefully for moderate positions as the zealots do , by encouraging people to listen to different points of views , by pushing for a return to more mixed congressional districts and by making sure to vote in all elections			1
instead of wasting energy raging against individual politicians , it would be more productive to fight against apathy and against demonization			0
hating individual politicians misses the point			0
fight instead to fix the system that is broken			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity245			1

@entity245 : *frustration* with politics leads people to lash out with hatred
she says rather than hate @entity5 , @entity3 , @entity11 or @entity9 , look at the root causes
@entity255 says @entity4 political system rewards polarization , which wins low - turnout elections
centrists need to speak out to put politicians on the right track , she says
