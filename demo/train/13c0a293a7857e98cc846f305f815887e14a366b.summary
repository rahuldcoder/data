@entity0 -- gas prices might have breached the $ 4 per gallon mark in the @entity4 , but there wo n't be much sympathy for the @entity4 plight in @entity8			1
in fact , that @entity4 price of £ 2.52 a gallon looks highly affordable compared to the @entity13 's current average cost of £ 6.22 ( $ 9.85 )			1
in some places here you 'll pay an eye - watering £ 7.27 ( $ 11.52 ) for a gallon of super unleaded			1
and prices throughout the rest of @entity8 are similarly high			1
but it is worth sparing a thought for the hard - pressed @entity23 who 'll pay £ 7.28 ( $ 11.54 ) for a gallon of the regular stuff across their country			1
if the price of oil was the only factor to dictate the expense of gas it would n't be such a bitter pill			2
the government decides how much we 're going to pay per gallon			2
surprise , surprise , it also decides that the majority of it should be diverted to their coffers			0
so of our £ 6.22 average , £ 3.74 ( $ 5.92 ) , or a bit over 60 % , ends up in the @entity49 's back pocket			2
the government is n't the only guilty party			0
fuel producers take 36 % , which goes some way to explaining @entity54 's obscene £ 18.1bn ( $ 28.6bn ) profits from last year			2
what 's the highest price you 've seen ? and of course unrest in the @entity60 including sanctions against @entity62 and simmering discontent over @entity64 is n't helping			0
but every time the price of oil goes up , the @entity13 government is quids in			1
its second tax , @entity69 ( @entity69 , similar to @entity4 sales taxes ) , is levied on the final cost , giving us an inescapable double whammy			1
hardly unsurprisingly , all this money grabbing has had a noticeable effect on the cars @entity8 drive			1
people now discuss their motors in terms of miles per gallon rather than miles per hour			1
owning a car that does a mere 35mpg seems so last century			0
and no one will be impressed unless your mpg figure starts with a six			0
would i like to be smoking about in a dirty great beast with a dipsomaniac 's thirst for the hard stuff ? of course i would			0
but if i could afford to buy such a car , running it would be akin to having a mistress who drinks champagne rather than chardonnay			0
at first i felt deep resentment at being forced into a small car			0
but you know what ? today 's small cars are big in benefits			0
the @entity101 i now drive is the same size as the first ever @entity103			0
the difference is it 's comfier and has more features , including a petrol gauge that moves in slow motion			0
fuel is a drug the @entity4 has long since needed weaning off			1
admittedly @entity4 have to cover greater distances than @entity8			1
but you do n't need a glorified double bed powered by a throbbing great @entity114 to do that			0
a sensibly - sized car with a two - liter turbo will do the job just as comfortably			0
and with developing nations such as @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 demanding ever more fuel , the planet ca n't put up with anyone 's penchant for gas - guzzling monsters any more			2
but if the @entity8 experience is anything to go by , the $ 4 gallon is n't going to alter driving habits dramatically			1
@entity4 needs petrol prices to double if people are to permanently park up their 15mpg pick - up trucks			1
maybe then it 'll elicit a bit of sympathy from over here			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140 .			2

in the @entity13 , a gallon of gas can easily come to around $ 10 , says ***writer*** , compared to around $ 4 in the @entity4
@entity140 : high price of fuel *impacts* the type of cars that @entity8 drive
@entity8 now discuss their motors in terms of miles per gallon , says ***writer*** , rather than miles per hour
***writer*** : @entity4 needs petrol prices to double if people are to permanently park up their 15mpg pick - up trucks
