-- the number of minors treated in hospital emergency rooms for drinking on @entity4 2009 was nearly four times the average daily figure , according to a federal study			1
the study , published this week in the @entity8 , was based on data from the @entity10 , which estimated that 1,980 emergency room visits on @entity4 2009 involved underage drinking , versus 546 such visits on an average day			1
" this stunning increase in underage drinking - related emergency room visits on @entity4 should be a wake - up call to parents , community leaders and all caring adults about the potential risks our young people face for alcohol - related accidents , injuries and death during this time of year , " @entity15 chief @entity14 said in a statement about the agency 's study			1
" parents , clergy , coaches , teachers and other role models must do everything they can to positively influence young people -- including talking with them early and often about the many health dangers underage drinking poses to their physical and emotional health and well being			0
" the findings translate into an increase in sobering statistics , said @entity44 , acting director of the @entity45			0
" for example , during @entity47 and @entity48 's , two to three times more people die in alcohol - related crashes than during comparable periods the rest of the year , " he said			0
" and 40 % of traffic fatalities during these holidays involve a driver who is alcohol - impaired , compared to 28 % for the rest of december			0
" the @entity4 levels outstripped those of other holidays			2
for example , @entity61 emergency room visits for drinking by minors were 676 ; the @entity66 level was 942			1
" whereas all underage alcohol consumption is of concern , consumption that leads to er visits on @entity4 should be of particular concern to parents and young people because such consumption may increase other risky behaviors , " it said			2
" greater access to alcohol , less parental oversight and mixed messages from parents may fuel surges in underage drinking , which can result in visits to hospital emergency departments because of overconsumption or alcohol - involved accidents or injuries			2
@entity90 's holiday may be particularly risky because underage individuals may drink more than during most other times of the year , including other holidays			0
