when @entity1 ended @entity3 's eight - year reign at the @entity4 in april , it marked the perfect start to the world @entity7 's clay - court season			1
but @entity1 's ensuing performances on clay have n't been anywhere near as impressive			2
after losing his opening match to @entity13 at the @entity14 last week , @entity1 fell in the quarterfinals of the @entity16 on friday against a player who he previously held a 13 - 1 record against			1
@entity19 rallied from a set down to beat @entity1 2 - 6 , 7 - 5 , 6 - 4 , denting the @entity22 's preparations for the @entity23 , which begins may 26			1
@entity1 could n't serve out the match at 5 - 3 in the second set			1
" i lost the concentration , " @entity1 told reporters			2
" i started playing more defensively			0
i played a bad game at 5 - 3 and the match turned around			1
he started playing more confidently , stepping into the court and taking advantage of his opportunities			0
" it 's a very strange situation			0
i played very well and was two points from winning			0
then the entire match changed and i was a different player			2
" @entity1 's defeat opened the door for @entity3 and the defending champion continued his mastery over fellow @entity42 @entity41			1
@entity3 prevailed 6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 2 to improve to 16 - 1 against @entity41 on clay -- @entity41 won their first match in 2004 -- and set up a showdown with @entity19 in a repeat of the 2010 @entity49 final , which @entity3 won			1
if @entity3 claims the title in @entity16 , he will leapfrog @entity41 to no. 4 in the rankings in time for the @entity23 seedings			1
@entity54 @entity53 beat @entity55 6 - 1 , 6 - 0 to advance to his first @entity57 semifinal and will face @entity58 in the last four			0
meanwhile in the women 's draw , a repeat of the @entity14 final between the world 's top two failed to materialize when @entity65 withdrew from her quarterfinal with home favorite @entity67 due to illness			1
@entity65 , the reigning @entity23 champion , lost to @entity70 in straight sets in the @entity73 capital			2
" i was already a bit off in @entity14 and played through it and it came back last night , " @entity65 said			2
" and i got sick again and it 's not smart to compete again two or three rounds to win the tournament and with @entity79 starting next week			0
" the doctor thinks i did n't take it easy last week and if i do n't take care of it now , then it might worsen			0
it is one of those things , and the body is not ready and with a bigger goal around the corner it 's important to make the right and smart decisions			0
i have a lot of clay matches and so this is not lacking before the @entity23			0
" @entity70 crushed @entity94 in under an hour to extend her winning streak to a personal best 22 matches and next meets @entity99 qualifier @entity97 in the semifinals			0
@entity67 , runner - up to @entity65 at @entity23 , confronts @entity102 in the other semifinal .			1
