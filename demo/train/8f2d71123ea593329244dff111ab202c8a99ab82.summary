-- the world of fashion responded to @entity4 's march earthquake , like many other industries , with the desire to help its victims			1
@entity4 clothing companies and fashion magazines mobilized charity campaigns and donated clothes to people in the stricken area			1
@entity14 even designed a special bracelet that raised over $ 250,000 for the relief effort			0
personal shopping habits and even styles in @entity4 were also affected by the tragedy , but not necessarily in a negative way			1
" it is not our impression that people refrained from buying or wearing colorful clothing ( after the earthquake in march ) , " said @entity21 , editor of @entity22			1
" on the contrary , some deliberately chose bright colors to retain a positive attitude and give themselves and others a lift , " she added			0
in cities far from where the tsunami hit , the immediate period after saw fashion stores close their doors to shoppers , adverts pulled from public places and sales of luxury brands drop			1
however , by may sales for many luxury goods had risen above pre-disaster levels , according to @entity21 , especially for items that transcended fashion , namely engagement and wedding rings			1
" in times of crisis , people gain a fresh appreciation of what is really important in their lives			2
" these trends are a good indication of how people are seeking peace of mind , stability , and steadiness under the unsettling and uncertain circumstances , " she said			2
for those who did n't get the urge to marry , simple retail therapy was another response to the disaster			0
according to a survey by @entity74 trend and innovation agency five by @entity76 , 58 % of consumers in the big city areas of @entity79 and @entity80 continued shopping for clothes and fashion as normal after the earthquake			0
of the 40 % of people surveyed who admitted to reining in their clothes shopping , the main reason was personal finance rather than self - restraint or a sense of solidarity with the victims in the @entity93			0
" people did pull back somewhat immediately after ( the disaster ) , but shopping did n't stop and they were buying items that were less obvious , like fragrances , " said @entity94 , director of trends for @entity95			1
" the perfume market for @entity4 is traditionally small compared to @entity101 , but it spiked after the earthquake			1
it was something that could be enjoyed without being conspicuous or risk of being seen to come out of store carrying lots of shopping bags			0
" @entity4 's annual summer program of " setsuden " ( energy - saving ) was given extra significance this year with the nuclear crisis at @entity113 and reduced power supply			2
it also meant some fashion brands recast their marketing strategies			0
fast fashion label @entity118 brought out its " @entity127 " line of insulating clothing at the end of july to tap into people 's desire to cut back on heating bills and use less energy			0
now , six months since the earthquake , big - city consumer habits are back to normal and representative of a larger trend , suggests @entity132			1
" people have n't deliberately made a stand ( through their shopping habits )			0
if anything the earthquake has just amplified the feelings before it , which were generally representative of post-consumerism			0
young people often feel they ca n't afford things and people look for more from a purchase , as well as being savvy enough to look online			2
" @entity21 echoes the sentiment that @entity4 consumers are more selective in their fashion purchases			1
" if there was any change of this nature , it seems to lie ... in a stronger inclination to select articles they will continue to be fond of long into the future , " she said			0
@entity21 also hopes that this year 's " @entity162 's @entity161 " -- an evening of shopping and events on november 5 -- will give @entity4 's fashion industry a boost and reinforce the way the fashion can give back to the community			2
@entity22 's editor in chief @entity166 and other regional editors of @entity22 will attend as a show of solidarity			1
" @entity162 should make a more important contribution for social and economic good in what is a critical situation , " said @entity21 .			0
