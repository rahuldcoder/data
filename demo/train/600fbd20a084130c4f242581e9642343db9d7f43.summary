in the space of a short few months , the self - styled @entity0 has claimed to have established a fundamentalist state and revived the @entity5 , while seemingly monopolizing the market on young foreign fighters from @entity8 and @entity9 , while conducting a sophisticated social media and propaganda campaign			0
amid the highly publicized beheadings of @entity14 journalists , soldiers and aid workers accompanied by personal messages to @entity19 president @entity18 , @entity2 has established itself as the main jihadist group in the world today , leaving @entity22 struggling to make an impact			1
however , @entity22 is now fighting back and seem eager to reclaim some of the limelight			0
in a 55 - minute video released less than two weeks ago , the current leader of @entity22 , @entity26 , promised to " raise the flag of @entity22 " and to spread @entity30 rule across the @entity31 by operating in @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 , under the new rubric " @entity22			1
" although government officials are still trying to verify the authenticity of the video , the idea has already been welcomed by the @entity40 @entity39 , whilst @entity32 has expressed deep concerns over @entity22 's plan to establish a permanent presence in the region			1
@entity26 's announcement did come as a bit of a surprise , as the recent activities of @entity2 had been dominating news headlines all over the world and led many to believe that @entity22 has now dwindled and faded into the background , as newer , younger and more sophisticated groups have replaced it			1
as to why the @entity32 subcontinent has been declared as the new home for @entity22 , @entity26 cites the aim of rescuing @entity56 from oppression and injustice in the region as the group 's main driving force			1
' muslim lands ' in the video , @entity26 makes reference to tribal violence in @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 , as well as violence against the @entity56 by @entity71 in @entity34			0
by arguing that places such as @entity33 and @entity34 were once " muslim lands " until the enemy occupied and fragmented them , @entity26 proposes that the lives of @entity73 people in the region can be improved and liberated through the establishment of an @entity30 state guided by @entity82 law			1
however , the timing of the video suggests the reasons @entity26 gives are surface deep			0
in truth , this bold announcement by @entity22 is more likely an attempt to branch out into new and untapped markets that are viewed as beyond the reach of its rival , @entity2			2
this would be an obvious and natural thing for @entity22 to do since @entity2 clearly has far more success both globally , in terms of publicity , and locally , in that they have eclipsed the local @entity22 affiliate , @entity99			2
@entity2 has also managed to do things @entity22 never could			2
for one , being primarily focused on fighting a distant enemy -- the @entity14 -- @entity22 has been unable to evolve beyond being a terrorist organization , whilst @entity2 has moved from being an @entity22 offshoot to progressing into a fully - fledged state -- or at least that is how they and their fellow jihadists view things			1
this has enabled @entity2 to attract foreign fighters on a far larger scale than @entity22 ever did			2
more worryingly , from @entity22 's perspective , is the fact @entity2 seems to be attracting smaller splinter groups previously viewed as being in @entity22 's domain of influence			1
for example , the @entity123 - based " soldiers of the @entity5 " group , which was previously viewed as an @entity22 - linked faction in @entity122 , recently declared itself an ally of @entity2			1
regardless of the reasons @entity22 gives -- or does not give -- as to why it is expanding into the @entity127 , the strategic and tactical implications of this move are potentially immense			0
firstly , although 80 % of the population is @entity131 , according to a 2011 census , @entity32 alone houses around 140 million muslims whilst another 132 million or so @entity56 are in @entity33			2
this means roughly one fifth of the world 's @entity56 are in these two countries alone , whilst @entity34 is home to a small @entity73 community that is being systematically persecuted			0
@entity22 's plan will fail with the @entity40 market being saturated and @entity2 increasingly dominating the @entity140 , one can understand why @entity22 has decided to push into this largely untapped market , especially since so few jihadist recruits , in relative terms , have been from these two countries historically			1
however , there are good reasons why @entity32 and @entity33 have not been fertile breeding grounds for jihadists in the past			1
these countries have their extremist minorities too but they have not experienced the large influx of @entity152 largesse that neighboring @entity40 has , and they have much more pluralistic cultural traditions			0
in the case of @entity32 at least , there is also a much more robust democracy and in the case of both countries @entity159 - inspired groups do not have significant influence in government			0
in all likelihood , @entity22 's attempts to branch into @entity32 and @entity33 will fail			1
in fact , @entity26 is illustrating his cultural naivety by making this announcement and assuming that these countries are just like @entity40			0
they have also got off to a very bad start by mistakenly attacking a @entity40 frigate which they mistook for an @entity19 aircraft carrier a couple of days ago			0
three terrorists were killed and seven arrested in the failed attempt			0
it is clear is that @entity22 is panicking and witnessing the rise of @entity2 with dread and jealousy			2
however , they will have to work a lot harder to regain the momentum they lost after the killing of @entity188 .			0

@entity2 has established itself as the main jihadist group in the world today
this has left @entity22 struggling to make an impact , according to @entity196 's @entity195
@entity22 leader @entity26 promises to " raise the flag of @entity22 " and spread @entity30 rule across @entity31
but there are good reasons why @entity32 and @entity33 have not been fertile breeding grounds for jihadists , @entity195 says
