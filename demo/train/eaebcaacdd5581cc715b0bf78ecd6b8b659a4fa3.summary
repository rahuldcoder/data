@entity11 and husband @entity12 pictured outside the @entity13 in october 2008			2
but the woman did get a strong hint that anyone who helped her travel to a country where assisted suicide is legal would not be prosecuted			1
@entity11 , 45 , had asked the @entity18 to clarify @entity6 's laws on assisted suicide -- an option she has said she wants if her pain one day becomes unbearable			1
under the current laws , @entity22 says , it is not clear at which point her husband would be breaking the law if he helped her to travel to an assisted suicide clinic			1
@entity22 was appealing an october ruling by the @entity13 , which also refused to clarify the laws			0
@entity22 suffers from primary progressive multiple sclerosis , in which symptoms become progressively worse over time			0
she has said she wants the option to travel abroad to have an assisted death should her condition deteriorate			1
under @entity6 's current law , @entity22 's husband , @entity12 , could face 14 years in prison if he accompanies her to a country , such as @entity40 , where assisted suicide is legal			1
@entity22 had asked the @entity13 judges to tell her at what point @entity12 would be subject to prosecution -- whether it would include helping her into a car , sitting with her on the plane to the clinic , or helping her with her bags			0
in its judgment thursday , the appeal court did imply @entity12 would be safe from prosecution			2
the judges referred to the earlier case of @entity52 , a 23 - year - old @entity6 rugby player who died in an assisted suicide last year			1
@entity52 had been paralyzed from the neck down in a rugby accident			0
@entity52 ' parents , @entity57 and @entity58 , flew with their son to an assisted suicide clinic in @entity40			1
they faced questions on their return to @entity6 but were not prosecuted			2
the court said the decision not to prosecute the @entity73 " is illustrative not only of the care with which the issue in these cases would be approached , but also an extremely helpful example of the kind of broad circumstances in which ... the ultimate decision would be that a prosecution should not be mounted , " according to an excerpt released by @entity75 , the charity that worked on @entity22 's case			0
" if the prosecution amounts to an abuse of process , the court will dismiss it , " the court said in its judgment			0
@entity22 said that wording made her feel like she had won her argument , even though she lost the appeal			0
" i am very grateful for , and respect the ruling of the appeal court , " she said in a statement			2
" they have done everything they can do to clarify that , given the @entity52 judgment , @entity12 would be unlikely to be prosecuted if he were to accompany me abroad for an assisted death , and we are therefore one step closer to the clarification i need			1
" dignity in @entity97 has said it is important for the @entity6 government to distinguish between people who maliciously encourage suicide and those who accompany a loved one abroad to die			1
under current law , the @entity103 , assisting a suicide is a crime punishable by up to 14 years imprisonment			0
anyone who aids , abets , counsels or procures the suicide of another , or an attempt by another to commit suicide , is liable			0
dignity in @entity97 has said it ultimately wants @entity6 law changed to allow the terminally ill the choice of assisted death			1
to date , no one who has accompanied a loved one to the @entity40 clinic @entity121 has been prosecuted , but they have been questioned by police and threatened with prosecution , according to @entity75			2
" the courts have done all they can , " said @entity124 , chief executive of @entity75			0
" they make quite clear that only @entity127 has the authority to change the law			0
if there 's no public interest in prosecuting , there must be a public interest in updating the law to remove doubt			0
