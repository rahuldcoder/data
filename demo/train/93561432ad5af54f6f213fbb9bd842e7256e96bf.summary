-- who 's to blame for the mine collapse that trapped 33 workers underground for months in @entity4 ? no one , according to prosecutors , who closed the case thursday after a lengthy investigation			1
nearly three years after the collapse at the @entity12 mine in @entity13 , @entity4 , prosecutors said , there 's not enough evidence to file criminal charges			1
the 2010 mining accident drew global attention as word spread that the workers had survived and rescuers worked for weeks to free them			0
for 17 days after the collapse , nobody knew if they were alive			0
the miners spent 69 days underground before they were rescued			2
" this was a complicated case , which is why it took us so long to make this determination , " regional prosecutor @entity25 said			1
" and i want to be clear in saying that everything to collect evidence that the law allows was done			0
" authorities investigated the case for years , he said , compiling expert analysis and testimonies that totaled more than 20,000 pages			0
two outraged miners told @entity40 late thursday that they plan to appeal the regional prosecutor 's decision			1
the owners of the mine should be held responsible in a criminal case , they said , alleging that the company knew there was a risk of collapse and did n't do enough to protect workers			1
the miners have also filed a negligence lawsuit against the government , accusing the agency that oversees mining of failing to ensure safety measures			1
" today we heard the decision , as did many of our colleagues , and many of them are extremely shocked , " said @entity57 , the miners ' shift boss and the last man rescued from the mine			1
" because this is something that places responsibility upon the mine owners , because they are the entity that must supervise what happens			2
as supervisors , they should have prevented it			0
they should have known what sectors were at risk of collapsing			0
" the miners want future accidents to be prevented , he said , and they want the mine 's owners to be held accountable			1
" we want for this never to happen again , " he said			0
" what happened to us was not a work of nature			0
this was done by a man , by the negligence of man			2
" attorneys for the mine 's owners told @entity40 on thursday that the prosecutor 's decision indicated that natural causes sparked the accident , and the company 's owners are not responsible			1
" this decision was n't made on a whim , " said attorney @entity100			1
" it is part of a long investigative process			0
" @entity106 said the miners are n't looking for money , but they do want justice			1
and comments like @entity112 's , he said , show that they have n't gotten that yet			2
" she is laughing at what happened to us , " he said			0
" i think any miner is going to feel the same way			0
if they did nothing for us , when we were trapped for 70 days 700 meters underground , what is going to happen when there 's another incident ? ... any person can do anything in @entity4 , and there is no justice			2
