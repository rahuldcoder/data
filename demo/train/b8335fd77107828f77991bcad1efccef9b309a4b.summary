-- @entity1 on friday responded to tougher sanctions from the @entity3 with another barrage of vitriol , repeating a vow to ditch all nonaggression pacts with the @entity8			1
a day after the isolated regime in @entity12 had threatened a possible " pre-emptive nuclear attack , " something analysts say they think is unlikely , its official news agency reeled off a number of agreements with @entity18 that it said would no longer apply			2
it 's the latest installment in a week of furious rhetoric from the @entity1 , fueled by its anger over the @entity3 vote on the new sanctions , a response to @entity1 's recent nuclear test , and joint military drills by the @entity23 and @entity18 , which take place in the region each year			1
@entity1 watchers and @entity23 officials said the recent frenzy of ominous language from @entity1 under its young leader @entity34 makes the situation on the @entity36 more worrying and unpredictable			1
@entity18 has warned the @entity37 that it will retaliate strongly and sternly if its citizens are threatened			0
" this surge in provocative rhetoric is particularly dangerous , " said @entity39 of the @entity40			0
" @entity18 's new president ca n't be seen to back down in the face of the @entity1 's threats , while @entity34 may feel that his successful missile and nuclear tests give him the ability to keep pressuring @entity49			1
the two may wind up talking themselves into conflict			0
" @entity18 president @entity52 , who took office late last month , said friday that @entity49 would respond strongly to any provocation from @entity12 , the semiofficial news agency @entity55 reported			0
@entity23 defense secretary @entity56 offered a similar promise			0
" @entity23 and our allies are prepared to deal with any threat , " @entity58 said			0
the possibility of a flare - up was highlighted by the @entity65 - based @entity64 , which predicted a provocative move from the @entity1 " in the coming weeks			1
" the center said that according to its research , @entity12 has carried out " a military provocation of some form within weeks of every @entity18 presidential inauguration dating back to 1992			0
" a military clash could risk drawing in the @entity23 , which has about 28,500 troops stationed in @entity18 as part of the security alliance between the two countries			0
the most recent skirmish between the two @entity79 took place in november 2010 , when the @entity1 shelled an island on the @entity8 's side of the border , killing several people			1
@entity12 claimed @entity49 had provoked it by carrying out training exercises off the countries ' shared coast			0
the @entity23 is using satellites , radar and aircraft near the @entity36 in its recently stepped - up surveillance of @entity1 , @entity23 military sources said			2
so far , though , there are no signs of unusual military moves by @entity1 forces , according to the same @entity23 military officials			2
a week of strong threats the @entity37 's comments on friday reiterated statements it had made earlier this week promising to abolish the armistice agreement that stopped the @entity102 in 1953 and threatening strikes on the @entity23 and @entity18			2
claiming its enemies are " hell bent on confrontation and war fever , " @entity12 said it was now revoking " all agreements on nonaggression reached between the @entity1 and the @entity8 , " a declaration it has made in previous years			1
it also said it was nullifying the joint declaration on the denuclearization of the @entity36			0
the @entity37 , which conducted its third underground nuclear test last month , had said recently that denuclearization of the region was impossible because of what it described as the @entity23 ' hostile policy toward it			0
it also stated that it was immediately cutting off the " @entity8 hot line , " three days after it had already said it planned to terminate its military telephone line with the @entity23			0
the phone line is meant to serve as a tool to defuse potential flash points along the heavily militarized border between the two @entity79			0
but @entity127 , deputy public affairs officer for @entity128 in @entity18 , said that reports of the @entity1 's @entity130 , known as the @entity130 , cutting off communication often arise when military training exercises are taking place , as they are at the moment			2
" when we place a call on the direct phone line and the @entity130 does not answer , we have no way of knowing if the @entity130 has actually disconnected the phone lines or are just not answering the phone , " he said			0
on saturday , @entity1 's foreign ministry said sanctions against the @entity37 over the last eight years have only caused it to bolster its nuclear deterrent program " qualitatively and quantitatively , " according to the @entity1 's official news agency , @entity144			1
on friday afternoon , @entity146 spokesman @entity145 said @entity1 " will achieve nothing through threats of provocations , which will only further isolate @entity1 and undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in @entity153			1
" @entity145 said the @entity23 " calls on ( @entity1 ) to refrain from further threats and provocative actions , " and said the @entity23 is fully capable of defending itself and its allies , including @entity18 and @entity155			1
new @entity3 measures tensions are particularly high at the moment because of the new measures against the @entity1 adopted unanimously on thursday by the @entity3			1
" these sanctions will bite , and bite hard , " @entity23 ambassador to the @entity164 @entity163 said after the vote			0
@entity167 , @entity1 's key ally , could have used its veto power to block the sanctions			1
instead , after weeks of negotiating , it signed on to the final draft			0
" @entity167 is a country of principle , " @entity167 's @entity3 ambassador @entity172 said			1
" we are firmly committed to safeguarding peace and stability on the @entity36			0
" on friday , @entity167 's @entity177 called upon " all relative parties to stay calm and refrain from taking actions that may escalate tension			1
" spokeswoman @entity181 reiterated @entity167 's support for the sanctions , which have stoked @entity12 's fury			1
the goal of the new sanctions is to stymie the activities of @entity1 banks and cash couriers who might be funneling money to the secretive regime 's nuclear and missile programs			1
it will be tougher for the regime to move large sums of cash stuffed into suitcases , @entity195 said			0
the @entity3 resolution also outlines measures to step up scrutiny of suspicious sea shipments and air cargo and it expands restrictions to encompass several institutions and senior officials in the @entity1 's weapons industry , as well as a range of materials and technology known to be used in uranium enrichment			1
it also blocks the sale of luxury goods , such as yachts and certain high - end jewelry , to @entity1			2
" as a result , @entity1 's ruling elite , who have been living large while impoverishing their people , will pay a price " for the ongoing nuclear activities , @entity195 said			1
questions over sanctions ' effectiveness some doubt whether the new measures will make much difference			2
sanctions imposed after previous nuclear tests and rocket launches have failed to deter @entity12			2
@entity167 will go a long way toward determining whether the new sanctions really do have bite , analysts say			1
" as long as @entity167 allows @entity1 to operate , as long as @entity167 provides food , energy assistance and investment , the sanctions really do n't matter , " said @entity238 of the @entity239			1
@entity1 notoriously allows many of its people to live in malnutrition and starvation			2
still , the country needs a functioning economy , partly to finance its military , @entity238 said			0
@entity251 spokeswoman @entity250 said the @entity23 is committed to taking action to compel @entity1 to alter its approach			2
" we 're ... going to continue to increase the pressure if they do n't make the right choice , " @entity250 said			0
@entity0 's @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
