-- for years , @entity2 presidents and presidential candidates have strip - mined @entity5 movies for rhetorical nuggets			1
@entity7 warned @entity8 in 1985 that he had his veto pen at the ready if it voted a tax increase			0
" go ahead , make my day , " he baited , quoting @entity5 's @entity12 character in " @entity13			1
" " read my lips , " promised candidate @entity14 in 1988 , echoing @entity5 in the original " @entity12 , " adding , " no new taxes			2
" thursday night , @entity18 's campaign recruited @entity5 himself			1
the beloved actor / director , 82 , was the " mystery guest " at the @entity21 , a warm - up act for sen. @entity23 of @entity24 , who introduced candidate @entity18			0
he strode out on the stage , hair uncombed and a little wild , with his familiar , stiff - legged authority , and proceeded to deliver an improvised piece of performance art that triggered unintentional amusement and confusion within the @entity34 and throughout the viewing audience			1
but to many , the political nuggets @entity5 delivered this time were more like fool 's gold			1
" i never thought it was a good idea for attorneys to be president anyhow , " @entity5 rambled , perhaps unaware that @entity18 has a law degree , " because they 're arguing both sides of the issue			2
" news : @entity5 , the empty chair , and the speech everyone 's talking about " @entity5 became huge star as a man of few words			1
as a surprise guest on the @entity34 stage he had too many words ( i say as a friend ) , " tweeted newsman @entity53 of the actor 's apparently improvised act , where he addressed an empty chair meant to represent president @entity57			0
afterward , the @entity63 critic and @entity57 supporter @entity64 tweeted , " @entity5 , my hero , is coming across as sad and pathetic			2
he did n't need to do this to himself			0
it 's unworthy of him			0
" for this film critic and longtime admirer of @entity5 ( and a registered @entity70 ) , it was not the best hour for the former mayor of @entity73 , @entity74			2
but was i surprised that @entity5 , a man who describes himself as an " @entity2 " and who publicly endorsed @entity77 in 2008 , would appear at the @entity2 convention ? not at all			1
@entity5 is nothing if not a straight shooter			2
what did surprise me , a little , is that the @entity82 would invite @entity5 after prominent @entity82 such as @entity83 criticized the actor as an @entity57 tool for narrating @entity87 's " @entity89 " ad aired at the @entity88 this year			1
what also surprised me is that the @entity82 would invite the guy who told @entity92 in october , " these people who are making a big deal about gay marriage ? i do n't give a --- about who wants to get married to anybody else			2
why not ? " and it was surprising that , when the identity of the " mystery guest " was revealed thursday evening , many non-republicans took to @entity102 and @entity103 to pillory @entity5 , huffing that his appearance at the @entity82 convention " tainted " his movies for them			1
huh ? first of all , @entity5 publicly endorsed @entity18 this month			2
second of all , the actor who is a lower - case - l libertarian on social issues ( pro-gay marriage , pro choice , pro-ecology ) and a fiscal conservative is hardly one to toe a party line			0
have they watched @entity5 's movies ? you ca n't pin this guy down ideologically			1
as critic @entity126 has noted , " @entity121 runs deep in his movies , just as it runs through @entity125 culture			0
" @entity5 specializes in playing men in the moral shadowlands			0
during the @entity130 years liberals branded @entity132 movies like " @entity12 " as " fascist			0
" during the @entity135 years , conservatives tagged " @entity137 " as squishy " political correctness			0
" @entity138 knows what they made of -- @entity140 ! -- the assisted suicide in his other @entity143 - winning movie , " @entity145			0
" entertainment : stars react to @entity5 the first half of @entity5 's career he played men who shot first and thought about it later			1
the second half of his career , he 's largely devoted himself to exploring the consequences of that gunplay			0
is that @entity2 ? is that @entity70 ? i think it 's @entity125			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			0

@entity160 : @entity5 lines have long been used by politicians , mainly from right
she says last night at @entity82 convention , he made rambling , performance - art - type speech
she says left - *leaners* *groused* , but @entity5 going his own way politically is not new
@entity173 : he 's small " l " libertarian , with films showing ambivalence about @entity125 . and that 's ok
