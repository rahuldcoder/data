-- " the deadheads had it wrong , " says director @entity2			0
and to rub it in , he says it while standing next to @entity5 , the @entity6 's co-founder , at the @entity8 premiere of " @entity9 : the @entity10 of @entity5			1
" @entity2 ' new documentary about @entity5 's life follows the legendary guitarist from his troubled youth to today			1
and while @entity5 says the movie means he 's now " off the hook " in terms of ever writing a memoir , he 's still not very comfortable talking about himself and the way he 's seen by fans			1
@entity5 says in the film he does n't " trust pride " and tells people he 's more interested in looking forward than back , although he admits at his age " there 's always something to remind you of your past			1
" for @entity5 , when it comes to looking back at all of the concerts and experiences he had , what he misses most now are the moments the band spent together offstage			1
" i kind of miss the laughs , the yucks , because we kept each other amused , " @entity5 says			1
" that 's the only way we were able to stick together for all those years			0
people would come backstage , and they 'd listen to some of the repartee , the interplay going back , and they 'd just leave the room going ( fanning himself ) these guys are nuts ! but we had a lot of fun			0
" that fun contributed to the improvisational style that made the band so popular			0
@entity5 says he was influenced by jazz pianists when it came to creating his signature style on the guitar			1
and while the band learned how to extend the rhythm of a song playing live for audiences high on @entity62 , their approach to writing songs was extemporaneous			0
" the same song on a different day was a different song			0
as we were writing or arranging a tune that came to us , from whomever , we did n't have a formulaic way of approaching things , " @entity5 says			1
" it was pretty much @entity70 , if you will			0
" although fans are hoping for a @entity6 reunion , the film might be the best way for @entity76 to get some new material from the band			1
all @entity5 says about the possibility of getting back together is , " we 've got our best people on it			1
" reunion show or not , @entity2 promises fans will learn something new in his film			1
a self - described @entity76 , @entity2 says he learned a lot during the making of this film because " most of the things the @entity76 thought about the band -- how they related to the fans and the music and the fans and the jams -- it was all wrong			1
" and with that in mind , here are five things you may not have known about @entity5 and the @entity6			1
when @entity5 was a teenager he ran away with author and lsd advocate @entity103 and the @entity104 after a @entity106 concert			1
@entity103 wrote " @entity110 " and the " @entity109 " were immortalized by @entity107 in " @entity108			0
" some of the @entity6 's first gigs were at the acid test parties @entity103 would throw , where everyone was given an lsd - laced drink of @entity116 ( the drug was legal at the time )			2
@entity5 remembers shows where he would see the guitars move like " snakes " and the musical notes were visible			2
he admits sometimes the band would have to " flee " when it all got to be too much			0
but when it came to the @entity76 who would later follow the iconic band around from show to show , @entity5 says he was n't entirely comfortable with that			1
he considers the lifestyle in the film , saying if following the band rang " lofty bells for them , what 's wrong with that ? but if it takes your life down , that 's another story			2
" he expressed particularly limited sympathy for drug dealers , but if someone had the talent to make a living following the group , he tipped his hat to them			0
@entity5 and @entity146 used to take scuba diving vacations together			2
there 's a scene in the film where the pair are diving on a reef and @entity146 tickles an eel on the chin under water			0
@entity5 says the pair had " a lot of fun underwater , " and that @entity146 especially loved diving because underwater he was weightless			2
drugs and partying were always associated with the @entity6			2
@entity5 says there were times when the band members were worried about @entity146 's drug use and considered holding an intervention for their frontman			1
ultimately they decided to do what they could for him without that confrontation			0
@entity5 talks in the film about how he had to be @entity146 's " bag man " for a time , holding @entity146 's drugs			1
according to @entity5 , @entity146 was doing heroin , marijuana and cocaine , and he would trust @entity179 to hold it because not only was the ( relatively ) health conscious @entity5 not going to use it , he would also limit how much @entity146 could have at once			2
@entity5 was also more than willing to have a good time on his own			2
in 1994 on the night the @entity6 were inducted into the @entity183 , @entity5 says he spent the night " partying fairly heavily , " and " when the fog lifted " he was under a table with the legendary @entity185			1
" we saw the wrong end of sunrise , " @entity5 says of the morning after the ceremony			2
their biggest hit " @entity191 " brought them a level of stardom they did n't really want			0
@entity5 says the band always hoped to have success and sidestep fame			1
but after the release of that song , the entire group , and @entity146 in particular , found themselves at the center of some outrageous behavior by their fans			0
in the film one story told is about how a fan purposefully tried to have a van driving @entity146 injure him so he would have some connection to the star			0
after " @entity191 , " according to @entity5 , they were unable to go out in public like they used to and often were forced to stay in their hotel rooms on the road			2
he was the ladies man of the group , and always had the most women of the band			0
in the documentary , the @entity6 is referred to in the early years as " beautiful @entity224 and the ugly brothers			1
" drummer @entity226 says they all used to " take @entity5 's runoff			0
" now a happily married father of two daughters , @entity5 says he spent 30 years " shopping around " before settling down			0
he met his wife @entity232 after a show when she was 15 years old and she sneaked backstage			0
they say the relationship was platonic until years later , after @entity146 's death and as @entity5 was " edging towards 50			0
" he says he looked around to see if he could be an aging " rock and roll tomcat " gracefully and " it did n't look promising			0
