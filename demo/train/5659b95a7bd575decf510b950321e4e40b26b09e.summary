@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is going to create a safer source of nuclear energy , help reduce the world 's stockpile of nuclear weapons , screen container ships for weapons and power manned missions to other planets			1
but first ... he has to graduate high school in may			0
@entity15 is going to bring his 3 - cent screening test for pancreatic , ovarian and lung cancer to market -- an alternative to a standard $ 800 test			2
but @entity15 , 16 , has n't been to high school much lately and is n't even sure he 'll graduate			0
the two teenagers with @entity26 style haircuts wowed the 1,400 people who attended @entity28 this week , fitting the conference 's theme : " the @entity31			1
" they were among a number of youthful speakers who @entity38 's @entity37 called " some of the biggest showstoppers at the annual event			2
" by contrast , some of the older voices onstage struck notes that were far less hopeful			1
@entity46 economist @entity45 declared that the era of strong economic growth in the @entity49 is over -- as @entity49 faces the headwinds of an aging population , debt , inequality and educational weaknesses ; he argued that it 's hard to foresee innovations that could have the transformative effect electricity , indoor plumbing and the internal combustion engine had in powering growth in the past century			1
former @entity62 gov. @entity61 , calling for a private sector - funded " race to the top " among states , lamented the inability of @entity69 politicians to develop a national energy strategy			2
she got laughs when she noted that @entity73 ' approval rating is worse than lice , root canals and @entity76 ( although better than that of gonorrhea and meth labs )			0
@entity80 : @entity61 's clean energy proposal and @entity82 , an author and professor at @entity84 , sketched an even starker picture of political dysfunction , a " pathological , democracy - destroying corruption " in which a tiny minority of @entity49 representing powerful interests use their campaign donations to determine which candidates survive the primaries			1
even against long odds , @entity82 said the problem is fixable if enough @entity49 organize to bring about change			1
there were other speakers whose inventiveness and ambition were unambiguously upbeat			2
@entity101 spoke about developing a lower - tech method to save the lives of premature and low birthweight babies in regions where access to incubators is n't readily available			2
her social enterprise embrace distributes a specially engineered and heated sleeping bag that provides babies the heat they ca n't generate on their own until they 're developed enough to survive			0
@entity113 ceo @entity112 demonstrated @entity114 , a smartphone - like piece of headgear that enables access to your contacts , your e-mail , your searches and your photos			2
his pitch for the device -- now being tested by a select few for $ 1,500 apiece and due on the market later this year -- is partly that it frees people up from the " nervous habit " of constantly checking their smartphone as they walk : " is this what you 're meant to do with your body ? " @entity80 : @entity136 -- the art of asking @entity138 , talked of his open rov project , which markets an $ 800 kit -- using off - the - shelf parts -- for a remotely operated underwater vehicle that gives its makers the ability to explore underwater worlds in @entity147 fashion			1
@entity149 co-founder @entity148 did n't mention his recent dispute with a @entity152 reporter over the battery range of the all - electric @entity154 , but made a case for the car 's virtues before describing his effort to market solar panels to homeowners and businesses and his @entity163 commercial venture to the heavens			2
he screened a video of a reusable 12 - story - tall rocket launching , hovering and then returning to a launchpad ready for another flight			2
@entity163 capsule reaches @entity171 @entity172 demoed @entity173 , a $ 150 @entity175 - powered robot that recently launched			2
it uses the brains of the phone 's computer chip , its camera and a plastic chassis with tank - style treads to zip around a room , express emotions , interact with owners , kids and pets , and function as " @entity189 on wheels " for grandparents dropping in for a virtual visit			2
@entity193 , part of the three - person team that developed the device that lured a giant squid to an underwater camera , explained how it was able to get the first - ever video displaying the enormous size and intricacy of the animal in the deep ocean			0
13 - year old invents system to protect family livestock from lions @entity208 , an activist in @entity209 , is leading an effort to counter the neighborhood 's " food desert , " by growing fruits and vegetables on city owned and private land			1
" if kids grow kale , they 'll eat kale , " he said			0
" if kids grow tomatoes , they 'll eat tomatoes			0
" renowned photographer @entity225 showed finely etched works from his forthcoming book " @entity232 , " a 50 - pound , $ 3,000 behemoth ( there 's a less elegant and smaller version for under $ 70 ) that does justice to the detail of his exquisitely composed black and white photos shot around the world			0
@entity80 : @entity236 -- build a school in the cloud @entity239 , the 78 - year - old technologist who came to fame as editor of " @entity242 , " introduced an ambitious plan to recreate extinct species , using dna from museum specimens			1
the effort , echoing " @entity247 " , wo n't bring back dinosaurs -- their dna did n't survive the tens of millions of years since they disappeared -- but aims to " de-extinct " such species as the passenger pigeon , declared extinct in 1914			0
@entity28 normally attracts an audience of the elite of @entity255 , @entity256 and venture capital , along with foundation and corporate ceos , who pay $ 7,500 for the five - day event , which is moving next year from @entity0 to @entity261			1
( @entity2 has a partnership with @entity28 in which it publishes selected @entity80 along with text pieces by speakers )			1
@entity28 stands for " technology , entertainment and design , " although its subject matter has branched out widely since its founding nearly 30 years ago			1
the ingenuity of this year 's youthful speakers was remarkable , and so was the confident way they expressed their ideas			1
@entity3 , 18 , is finishing high school while also attending the @entity276			0
he first attracted attention for creating a nuclear fusion reactor at 14			1
in his @entity80 , he argued for an alternative to the most widely used nuclear power technologies			1
rather than create electricity by heating water and turning a turbine , @entity3 's new reactor would use nuclear fission to produce energy from molten salt			1
his plan would be to centrally manufacture small fission reactors and distribute them widely for burial underground			0
he said they could last for 30 years without refueling , compared with 18 months for larger commercial reactors			0
since the reactors would not be pressurized , radioactivity would not be expelled as widely into the environment as in an accident like the @entity299 disaster , @entity3 said			0
costs would be lower since reactors would not have to be built onsite			0
nuclear weapons could be recycled in the reactor , he said			1
and most exciting to the young space geek , such a reactor could power a spaceship to a distant planet and then be the power source for a human base at the destination , he said			1
@entity15 , who 's 16 and a high school sophomore , won the top prize in the @entity314 competition for his cancer screening test , which relies in part on carbon nanotubes to detect a protein that is present in the blood and urine in the early stages of the three deadly cancers , providing hope that they can be detected in time for a successful cure			0
he told @entity2 in an interview that he does n't go to high school much anymore but is busy with other projects -- including inventing an mri the size of a credit card and leading a team of high school students competing for the $ 10 million @entity334 to design a handheld device people could use to monitor their health			0
@entity15 and @entity3 probably do n't have to worry about it but another speaker added a sobering element to the celebration of youth at @entity28			1
@entity343 , a psychologist and author , argued against the idea that the 20s are a period of extended adolescence where people can postpone key life choices			0
by the time people reach 30 , they may have missed out on some key chances to take their life in the directions they hope to pursue			0
" thirty is not the new twenty , " she said , urging people to " claim your adulthood " and start making choices			0
spoken word poet @entity362 , a 36 - year - old whose new video " to this day " has attracted 5.5 million views , offered a reminder that for all that young people can achieve , many still carry a heavy burden			1
he told of being bullied as a child to the point that , without realizing it , he turned into a bully himself			0
he spoke of kids being called names , making them feel like " oddities juggling depression and loneliness " and challenged them : " if you ca n't see anything beautiful about yourself get a better mirror look a little closer stare a little longer because there 's something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit "			0

@entity28 conference theme was " the @entity31 . the @entity32 . the @entity33 "
speakers included a *mix* of young and older voices , many with ambitious ideas
one 18 - year - old with nuclear reactor experience proposed a different power plant design
older voices expressed concern about economic and political challenges facing @entity49
