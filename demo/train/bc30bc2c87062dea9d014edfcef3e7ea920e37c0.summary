-- @entity2 forces stormed the town of @entity4 this week , fired at the home of activist @entity6 , wounded the father of two and then hanged him from the balcony of his home			1
activists reported this grisly act by word of mouth and e-mail			1
but they took one more step			1
they released a shaky , 42 - second video showing his body dangling from a damaged building caught in the crossfire of war			1
the video appeared to be shot surreptitiously , from a narrow urban space where the cameraman could n't be spotted			2
it 's one of thousands of videos that @entity2 activists have uploaded or smuggled out of the country to document the actions of @entity31 's regime -- vilified by governments and people across the globe for its fierce crackdown on protesters			1
videos of demonstrations , clashes and security actions have marked the @entity2 uprising as a @entity43 revolt			1
the images have framed the conflict for other @entity2 , the wider world and history since the government has blocked journalists from freely covering the story			1
" social media became a powerful tool in getting the word out			2
" said @entity54 , spokeswoman for the opposition @entity55 , or @entity55 , citing the ferment during the @entity57			1
" the @entity59 revolution became a @entity61 revolution			2
" after the @entity2 uprising started last spring , activists soon realized immediately that their revolution needed video documentation to make their fight credible to the world			1
there was no internet in 1982 , when the government of @entity72 , the current ruler 's late father , conducted a bloody offensive in the city of @entity76 , she said			1
" that city essentially died violently and nobody could verify it			2
that is very much in the national consciousness because another @entity31 had done it before			2
we were n't going to let this @entity31 do it to us , " @entity54 said			2
after the uprising began last spring , the regime started blaming " armed gangs " for stoking unrest , a claim that activists all along regarded as bogus			1
" we realized we had to counter every argument , " she said			2
when the regime began denouncing the activist videos as fakes , the @entity55 started to make sure the people narrating the videos would say the name of the city and the time it was taken			1
the activists have been trained to avoid exaggeration , capture the leader of a demonstration when taping a video and show recognizable landmarks			2
" you want to try to find newspapers with current date , " @entity54 said			2
" you want to prove it happened on that date			2
" thousands of hours of video have n't been published because they are n't verifiable			1
" we send the major ones , not every one , " she said			2
as the uprising took hold , she said , activists used cell phones and uploaded videos			1
cell phones soon became an identifier of opposition activists			1
" if you were anywhere near a protest , they could look at your phone and you 'd be arrested , " she said			2
in time , holding cell phones near protests became illegal , she said			1
" at one point , it became a crime to own an @entity131			2
the @entity131 was in fact banned for a few days until the elites were outraged , " she said			2
" they rescinded the ban			2
" @entity31 himself has an @entity131 , she said			0
people got more innovative with technology , using hidden devices such as pinholes and pen cameras			1
when the government put cities under siege and cut off internet service , activists pivoted to satellite phones			1
" we leverage whatever we can , and we figure out different ways to get things out , " @entity54 said			0
regime soldiers sometimes will film protests and massacres and then sell the videos to activists			1
" some of them are simply corrupt			0
some of them do need the money			0
still others want to support the revolution , " @entity54 said			0
" you do whatever is humanly possible			0
" " @entity2 citizen journalists and activists " won the 2012 @entity163 sponsored by @entity164 on monday			1
@entity167 , an @entity55 activist who lives in @entity168 , accepted the award on behalf of the people " struggling on the ground to achieve what they have always dreamed -- to live in freedom and dignity			1
" she never uses her full name for security reasons			0
" the committees are almost the only way to keep the world abreast of the violence wracking the country , " @entity163 said			1
@entity54 said other groups such as the @entity184 of @entity185 and the @entity186 produce videos			1
" a lot of groups are doing the same thing , " she said			0
it 's not a ' sign of disunity , ' " she said			0
it 's a reflection of the " overarching desire " to bear witness to the regime 's brutality			0
" these people are pretty savvy			0
they are not new to the @entity200			0
a lot of them have been dissatisfied with the regime long before the revolution started , " she said			0
the @entity55 and other groups send press releases about news events around the clock			0
activists inside the country work to confirm details that would be suitable for print as well as video			0
for example , @entity54 said , her group is trying to track down information about a young @entity220 woman who was arrested after registering a new political party under the regime 's new constitution			0
the group wants to gather print material and look for video to document this development			0
" what 's critical about this little bit of information is that @entity31 implements reforms			0
then they get arrested , " she said			0
footage is n't only uploaded from the scene			0
it is smuggled out of @entity2 to @entity235 , @entity236 and @entity237			1
@entity238 , an activist along the @entity2 - @entity237 border , said the activists help fuel the uprising			1
they smuggle medical aid and journalists into the country and tote film across the border at their own risk			1
there might be funding from outside sources , such as international media smuggled in to the country			0
but @entity238 said , " they only have got themselves to rely on			0
" @entity238 and another activist named @entity253 did n't want their full names used for security reasons			0
" there is no doubt that all our moves on the ground are very risky because we are always subject to arrest each time we have to go through a security checkpoint , " said @entity253 , a @entity76 activist			0
the @entity2 videographers who document unrest have died in the line of the duty			1
one of them was @entity269 , killed in @entity185 last month in a mortar attack			0
others who died are @entity272 and @entity273 , who also operated in @entity185 , according to the @entity275			0
also known as @entity277 , @entity269 filmed " clashes and military movements , " the committee said			0
the 17 - year - old was filming an assault on the @entity185 district of @entity283 when he died			0
" @entity2 authorities have done everything they can to shut down news coverage of their actions			1
@entity289 and other local videographers have given their lives to ensure that the @entity2 government would not succeed , " the group said			1
the @entity55 's @entity167 , who accepted the @entity293 , said that " there are millions of stories " to tell			0
" we were talking to a mother of three detainees , and she made us promise each other that no matter what , we will never stop covering the events of our beloved @entity2			1
" journalist @entity302 contributed to this report .			0
