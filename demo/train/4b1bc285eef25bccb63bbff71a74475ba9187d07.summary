-- for the residents of @entity3 , @entity4 , time stopped at 12.51pm on february 22 , 2011 , when a massive earthquake ripped through the city , destroying homes , lives and businesses			1
one year on , reminders are never too far away , from the broken buildings to frequent aftershocks that rattle the city every day			1
some are too minor to feel ; others cause a sharp intake of breath			0
" february , 22 , 2011 ... is a date permanently etched into all of our minds , a date that will go down in the history of @entity4 as one of our darkest days , " prime minister @entity18 told crowds gathered for a civic memorial service in the city wednesday			1
the magnitude 6.3 quake shook the city for a matter of seconds , but it was long enough to kill 185 people from 14 countries			1
the tremor brought down buildings in the city center in the middle of the working day , trapping workers and triggering a national state of emergency as rescuers scrambled to save lives			1
most of the victims -- 115 -- were buried in the rubble of the @entity49 ( @entity48 ) building , which was later found by a government report to have been poorly constructed			0
one survivor , @entity51 , spoke to the media by cellphone as she lay trapped under her desk in the rubble of the five - story @entity56 building			0
after being pulled out , 24 hours later , she told @entity0 , " i was finding it hard to breathe , and i really thought that was it for me			0
i thought ' this is it - i 'm not coming out of here			0
' " @entity51 : a survivor 's story one year later , @entity3 remains locked in recovery mode , a city carved into zones labeled by color to indicate the severity of the earthquake damage to homes and land			1
for residents in the red zone , there is no future there			1
around 6,800 homes , many clustered along the @entity78 , have been designated for destruction			0
the government says around 46 % of residents in the red zone have accepted its offer to buy their land			2
some have cut their ties with the area ; others are still wading through insurance claims on homes waiting to be destroyed			2
before the quake , 22 - year - old desktop publisher @entity90 lived with her partner in @entity93 , a small suburb that has now been condemned			1
" it was a tiny wee suburb and nearly every house there has gone , " she said			0
" they said that our house was sinking towards the river			0
they reckon all land would travel towards the river			0
" they moved out of the red zone in november , but @entity106 said their new home suffered damage during the february quake and subsequent aftershocks , and may also need to be demolished			1
@entity106 works at the office at the @entity113 , which suffered a blow during the quake with the near collapse of the @entity117			2
it is currently being propped up with shipping containers while work continues to determine exactly how much of the building can be saved			0
the brightly - colored containers can been seen dotted through the city , at the makeshift " re : start " mall in the city center and along roads below unstable cliffs considered to be at risk of landslide			2
" it 's a city of two parts really , " said @entity130 , the earthquake recovery coordinator for the @entity113 , who works in the same office as @entity106			1
last week he took part in an @entity138 door - knocking team made up of representatives from varying faiths in the city			2
" even just on one street we met a family there who are struggling for food who had eight to ten people living in a two - bedroom house , " he said			2
" a lot of people are tired , stressed and frustrated			1
the rebuild seems to be going relatively slowly			2
there are lots of issues			0
" recovery efforts are being hampered by frequent aftershocks			2
the february 22 quake was one itself , after a larger , magnitude 7.1 quake the previous september			1
that one ran deeper so caused less damage			0
the government said there have been 10,000 quakes since last september , including 39 of a magnitude of five or greater			2
" we had a really good run from june until december the 23rd , then we got hit with a magnitude six quake , two days before @entity170			1
it really , really set people back			0
there was further damage , no one was injured , but it was a psychological blow for many people , " @entity130 said			0
while people struggle to recover , work continues to rebuild shattered buildings and infrastructure			1
prime minister @entity18 has said the recovery plan is making " good progress			0
" construction has started on 26 " significant " commercial buildings in the city center			1
work on 80 % of the 1,406 buildings marked for partial or full demolition has been completed			0
and 200 infrastructure repair projects are now underway , he said			0
" long term @entity3 will look much different but it will be vibrant , new and a great place to live , " @entity18 added			1
thousands have not stayed around to find out			0
population figures released in october , the first numbers made public since the quake , showed more than 10,000 people had left the city in the year to june 2011			1
on the eve of the anniversary , the city buried the unidentified remains of four people who were killed in the quake in a new cemetery			1
it will be one of the more somber reminders of that day			0
the city came to a halt for two minutes at 12.51 local time , as residents paid their respects to those who were killed			1
tomorrow they 'll get back to the long , drawn - out task of rebuilding their lives and moving forward .			0
