@entity1 presidential hopeful @entity0 is selling , but can he tempt 209 football federations to buy into his campaign to topple @entity5 ? the @entity7 great outlined an eye catching $ 3.5 billion giveaway as he seeks to build a base to challenge @entity5 in the may election			1
@entity0 's " for @entity15 " promised that 50 % of @entity1 's revenues -- $ 2.5 billion -- would be handed to the national associations over four years to help fund global grassroots football development			1
the former @entity17 and @entity18 star also wants to redistribute $ 1 billion of @entity1 's $ 1.5 billion reserves to the member associations			1
" after many conversations with football leaders , one of the consistent themes fed back to me is the way @entity1 currently distributes revenues to its member associations is very inefficient and ineffective -- especially for developing football across all associations , " said @entity0 at a media conference to launch his campaign at @entity22			2
" @entity1 belongs to its member associations and it is only natural that @entity1 's revenues and reserves are distributed back to them directly			1
" the impact of my proposals would mean between $ 8m - $ 10m being distributed to each member association across a four - year period			0
" " if done in the right way , with a clearly defined strategy that is centrally audited and monitored , this investment will radically enhance football opportunities for boys and girls and directly benefit all of @entity1 's @entity47			2
" having dealt with @entity1 's finances , @entity0 faced questioning over his knowledge of the world governing body 's executive committee members			1
asked to name the 25 committee members he came up with four names -- haltingly			0
moving on , @entity0 floated the idea of expanding the @entity56 to 48 teams in a bid to include more countries outside of @entity60			2
currently there are 32 teams that compete in the international extravaganza but @entity0 believes an extra three or four days of play would allow more nations to be accommodated			0
" by increasing the number of teams participating in the @entity56 , we not only make sure that we include more countries from across the world , but also enable @entity1 to raise significant increased revenues that can be used to invest in the growth of the game globally			1
as for the game itself he wants to put an end to " triple punishments , " trial out sin bins for unsporting behavior , and revert to the old offside rule -- where players are judged offside whether directly involved in play or not			0
ethical issues arguably have been a bit of minefield for @entity1 in recent years and @entity0 pledged to " lead by example , with the highest ethical and moral standards			0
" he 's up against @entity91 prince @entity90 who is using the same campaign company -- @entity93 -- which also works for @entity94 , the @entity60 confederation within @entity1			0
" all i can say is thank @entity96 in my life i have had a successful career ... i can stand on my own two feet , " said @entity0 , who is funding his campaign out of his own pocket .			0

@entity0 plans to give national and member states $ 3.5 billion of @entity1 's funds to help grassroots developments
the presidential *candidate* wants to increase the number of teams competing in the @entity56 to 48
if successful he would also like to see some changes to game rules
