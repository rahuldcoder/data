-- @entity3 's president @entity2 's choice of @entity4 as his first foreign capital visit is being seen by analysts as a symbolic move that demonstrates the increasing interdependence of the one - time @entity10 foes			1
from energy deals , trade and geo - politics , @entity3 and @entity13 have been in lock - step over a range of thorny international issues such as @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
a key element of the talks will be how to steer the future of the increasingly intertwined economies			0
trade between @entity4 and @entity26 grew 11.6 % to a record $ 88.1 billion in 2012 , according to figures from the @entity28			1
" they want to move that to $ 100 billion in years to come - there 's also a sense that they will want to push the domestic agenda and the foreign policy agenda as well , " said @entity0 's @entity29			1
while @entity3 and @entity13 already form a powerful bloc on the @entity39 , the warmer ties are also evidence of their perceived need to countervail a @entity43 - led dominance in global affairs			1
" in @entity48 , the @entity3 see someone who is a counterbalance to @entity43 in some areas , " said professor @entity45 , executive director of the @entity47 's @entity46			0
" @entity13 is nowhere near as big as it was before but at least they see someone who can provide at least a bit of triangulation between @entity3 and the @entity43 " long - stalled talks on a @entity13 - @entity3 gas pipeline gas deal will likely top the agenda during @entity2 's summit meeting with @entity13 president @entity48			1
vice-foreign minister @entity60 and @entity13 ambassador to @entity3 @entity62 had recently struck a hopeful note in briefing in @entity26 , saying that " significant progress " had been made and that both nations were looking forward to a breakthrough on the deal			2
senior executives from state oil giants @entity70 and @entity72 are accompanying @entity2 to @entity4 where it is hoped the new @entity3 president will give fresh impetus to pipeline talks			1
nevertheless , the @entity13 have been cautious on the deal			0
" on the @entity13 side , state media and others , are less confident that that deal will come through , " @entity78 said			0
" certainly the @entity13 worry that this relationship will become more unequal over time			0
" @entity13 's own economy has stagnated somewhat not having the robust growth we 've seen in @entity3			0
" @entity60 told a briefing that @entity13 and @entity3 would co-ordinate reactions to @entity43 plans to boost its missile defense in the @entity91 to counter the possibility of a potential @entity20 attack			0
while @entity3 and @entity13 officials have hailed the 48 - hour visit as a demonstration of ties which they say are at an historic high , professor @entity45 said that relations between the formerly fractious neighbors was often driven more by expedience than any real convergence of interests			1
" it 's hard to think of a more paranoid relationship in some ways : 1950s , very close ; 1960s , biggest enemies			0
there 's never really been a heart - to - heart moment in many ways			2
" there 's a quite deep distrust on one hand but on the other hand a pragmatic acceptance that this is a big relationship			0
" @entity2 and @entity48 will also likely compare notes ahead of the regional summit in @entity119 next week of the @entity121 group of developing economies : @entity123 , @entity13 , @entity124 , @entity3 and @entity119			2
even here , analysts say , @entity3 's perception is that this bloc is heavily influenced by the @entity43 " the conviction in @entity26 is that @entity43 is everywhere and they 've got to find other ways of exercising their interests without @entity43 being right up beside them , " professor @entity45 said .			2
