@entity0 -- @entity3 outrage continued monday in @entity4 over the government 's response to a deadly bullet train collision last weekend , even as operations resumed on the affected high - speed rail lines			1
a bullet train was struck from behind saturday night by another train near @entity12 in eastern @entity14 province , killing at least 38 people -- including two @entity17 citizens -- and injuring almost 200			1
the first train was forced to stop on the tracks due to a power outage and the impact caused six cars to derail , including four that fell from an elevated bridge			0
although @entity4 reporters raced to the scene , none of the major state - run newspapers even mentioned the story on their sunday front pages			2
a user of @entity33 , @entity4 's equivalent of @entity34 , first broke the story and increasingly popular social media outlets then provided millions of @entity4 with the fastest information and pictures as well as the most poignant and scathing commentaries			1
by the time the railway ministry held its first press conference more than 24 hours after the collision , the public had seen not just reports of passengers trapped inside dark trains or images of a mangled car dangling off the bridge -- but also bulldozers crushing mangled cars that had fallen to the ground and burying the wreckage on site			1
" how can we cover up an accident that the whole world already knew about ? " said a defiant railway ministry spokesman @entity55			2
" they told me they buried the car to facilitate the rescue effort -- and i believe this explanation			0
" @entity55 was terse when reporters asked him to explain the fact that a toddler girl was being pulled out of the wreckage alive 20 hours after the accident -- and long after authorities declared no more signs of life in the trains			0
" that was a miracle , " he said			0
blaming lightning strike - triggered equipment failure as the cause of the accident based on preliminary investigation , @entity55 put on a brave face on the safety of @entity4 's controversial high - speed rail			1
" @entity4 technologies are advanced and we are still confident about that , " he said			0
while some state media echoed @entity55 's sentiment , many netizens questioned his every statement from the death toll to the cause and called him the face of a ministry mired in allegations of corruption and ineptitude			1
" this land is a hotbed for the world 's most sprawling bureaucracy and most cold - blooded officials , " user " chenjie " wrote on @entity33			0
netizens also dug up an old video clip showing the railway ministry 's chief engineer proudly telling state television in 2007 that @entity4 had developed modern technologies to ensure bullet trains never rear - end each other			1
the quick sacking of three top local railway officials in @entity112 -- who were in charge of the affected rail lines -- failed to placate the public , either			2
the announced new @entity112 railway chief prompted more scorn than applause , as the replacement -- the railway ministry 's chief dispatcher -- was once demoted for his role in another fatal train accident in 2008 that killed 72 people			1
in a user - generated opinion poll on @entity33 on the government 's handling of the accident , more than 90 percent of the 30,000 respondents chose the option " terrible -- it does n't treat us as humans			0
" now the world 's second - largest economy , and flush with cash , @entity4 has built the world 's longest high - speed rail network -- boasting more than 8,300 kilometers ( 5,100 miles ) of routes -- in a few short years			2
the government plans to pour over $ 400 billion into rail projects in the next five years			0
the massive investment and rapid construction have long raised public doubts on the new lines ' safety and commercial viability			0
the skeptics ' voices became louder after the former railway minister -- a champion of high - speed rail -- was sacked for corruption early this year			0
even the @entity112 high - speed rail -- the ministry 's newest and proudest project -- has broken down several times since its much - touted launch less than a month ago			2
" it 's not the faster , the better , " @entity157 , a railway professor at @entity158 in @entity112 and a long - time railway ministry consultant , told @entity1 last month			1
" we have to take safety , economics and environmental impact into consideration			0
" " strategically we can talk about a great leap forward in the industry , but tactically we have to do things step by step , " he added			0
back online , many users -- already jittery about safety in their daily life -- now view @entity4 's high - speed rail , long considered a symbol of the country 's fast rise , as a metaphor of its troublesome approach to development			1
" this is a country where a thunderstorm can cause a train to crash , a car can make a bridge collapse and drinking milk can lead to kidney stones , " user " xiaoyaoyouliu " posted on @entity33			2
" today 's @entity4 is a bullet train racing through a thunderstorm -- and we are all passengers onboard			1

@entity4 's equivalent of @entity34 becomes the main source of news as state media are slow to report the crash
@entity4 officials put a brave face on their response
*ordinary* people believe the railway ministry is corrupt and *inefficient*
