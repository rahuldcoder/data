it may seem an academic argument when you 're wiping sulphate - saturated tears from your eyes or coughing up a lung while sightseeing at the @entity7 or the @entity8 , but a new study says @entity10 has outstripped @entity11 and gained the inglorious title of the world 's most polluted major city			1
at its worst , air pollution in @entity10 this winter was 60 times higher than the level considered safe , the research from @entity17 's @entity16 ( @entity16 ) reveals			1
the most harmful airborne pollutants , categorized innocuously enough as @entity22 , averaged 575 micrograms per cubic meter in the @entity17 capital from november to january			0
that compared with a -- still dangerous -- concentration of 400 micrograms at peak levels in @entity11 over the same period			2
airborne danger @entity22 refers to the diameter in microns of nasties such as ammonia , carbon , nitrates and sulfate -- particulates small enough to pass into the bloodstream and cause diseases such as emphysema and cancer			0
a city such as @entity40 has an average @entity22 level of 20 micrograms , which is considered safe			2
@entity11 looks as though it could permanently lose lose its mantle as the world 's smoggiest big city if it keeps up the good work the @entity16 report describes			1
the @entity48 capital has made " consistent and aggressive efforts " to improve air quality , the @entity16 says , including limiting annual car sales , banning odd or even number - plated vehicles during " red alert " pollution periods and fining local governments for failing to curb smog			1
@entity10 , by contrast , is marked by " weak ... stringency ... and enforcement " of pollution controls			1
killer cities " originally designed as compact entities to reduce the length of travel ... [ @entity17 cities ] are becoming victims of killer pollution , congestion ... and a crippling car - dependent infrastructure , " the @entity16 says			0
it 's a quote @entity10 worthies must hope does n't make it into the next @entity74			2
it is , however , a decent snapshot of the aghast impression your average neophyte @entity17 traveler receives after stepping out of @entity81 when she thought she 'd come to the land of peace , love and really full - on yoga			0
the number of cars on @entity10 streets grows by 1,400 a day , with @entity17 manufacturers obliged to fit only basic emission - cutting apparatus to their vehicles			2
smoke from the burning of rubbish , industrial emissions and pollutants from the country 's predominantly coal - fired power stations add to the dangerous and noisome atmosphere , the @entity92 reports			0
@entity10 's report card @entity10 buses and some taxis might be running on natural gas , and 15 - year - old commercial vehicles have been taken off the road ( although that must in some cases include @entity17 's ubiquitous , hallucinogenically decorated trucks -- a bitter - sweet result ) but such measures are n't enough to stop many of the city 's inhabitants -- and the odd tourist -- from becoming seriously ill , the @entity16 report says			1
medical studies point to the toxic risk of smog in the wide prevalence of acute lung diseases , eye disorders and vitamin d deficiency leading to rickets among new @entity10 inhabitants			1
of particular concern to tourists , a @entity128 , @entity129 , study cited in the @entity16 report showed that pollution levels inside vehicles traveling in the @entity17 capital could be eight times worse than outside			2
as if riding in a @entity10 rickshaw was n't stressful enough			2
and , just to divine the origin of that metallic taste you ca n't rid from your mouth when sightseeing in @entity10 , the @entity16 study notes that " exposure to vehicular fume in [ the @entity17 capital ] is among the highest in the world			0
" would you still go ? forewarned is forearmed			0
it 's up to the individual traveler whether @entity10 's world - beating air pollution is enough reason not to see world - beating sights such as the @entity8 or chaotically creative -- and quintessentially @entity17 -- @entity152 street market			1
on the other hand , it seems , you now have more reasons not to be afraid of trying @entity11 roast duck on location or venturing into the @entity7			0
the ' dirty 10 ' and the dirtiest cities of all in the world , not just the big metropolises ? @entity10 -- and @entity11 -- were missing from such a list published in 2013 by the online business publication @entity163			1
with almost one - third more toxic airborne particulates than the next most polluted city , @entity166 , pop. 3 million -- capital of @entity170 's main oil producing province -- was the dirtiest city on the planet			0
other smog - bound centers in the ranking of 10 were @entity176 , @entity177 ; @entity178 , @entity17 ; @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 , @entity182			0
intrepid travelers : watch out			0
would air pollution put you off visiting @entity10 , @entity11 or @entity166 , for that matter ? tell us in the comments field below .			1

@entity11 loses " dirty crown " as major city with worst air pollution
