@entity2 , @entity3 on a recent morning , @entity0 and other family members walked into the @entity5 in search of answers			1
they had come to see official video footage of a police shooting that took place more than a year ago			1
@entity13 , 74 , was killed last december after he rushed an officer while wielding a hatchet , police have said			1
video of the incident , captured by an officer 's lapel camera , proved the shooting was justified , officials have argued			1
a grand jury heard the case , saw the footage and decided not to issue an indictment			2
but for more than a year , @entity0 's younger brother , @entity26 , 69 , said he and others have been asking to see the tape for themselves			2
and what they saw on december 19 only seemed to raise more questions , leaving them to feel the shooting was more senseless than ever			1
with police shootings making headlines across the nation , the @entity2 case adds a different layer to the conversation -- not least of all because of the city 's historic civil rights significance			1
@entity4 saw the video , which runs four minutes and 48 seconds , after the family did			1
it shows a patrol officer pulling up to an abandoned building , where two other officers have already gathered			2
one officer ducks inside the building and soon @entity13 emerges , holding an ax and cussing			1
an officer follows , there are at least 20 shouts to " drop the ax , " and then @entity0 turns toward the officer , appears to lunge toward him , and -- bang -- he 's dead			1
officers had been called to respond to a disturbance at a @entity58 restaurant , but found @entity0 across the street in the long - gone @entity60			0
@entity0 said his brother , once a mechanic , had " lost himself " after his wife left him decades ago and his house burned in a fire			0
he said @entity2 police knew his brother " acted crazy , " and walked the streets but that he never harmed anyone			1
and he just ca n't understand why they had to follow him			0
" he 'd left @entity58 , and was n't shot for disturbing the peace , but because they were messing with him in his domain			1
" @entity0 said requests to see the video only gained traction after a small band of protesters took to the streets			1
it was the @entity80 , @entity81 , protests that inspired longtime activist @entity83 to lead the charge for the @entity0 family in @entity2 , though the circumstances are vastly different from @entity80			1
@entity2 , which is more than 80 % @entity87 , has a black mayor , a black police chief , a black district attorney and a majority black city council			1
so was the officer who shot him			1
but for @entity83 , the problem in @entity2 goes far beyond this one case			0
@entity2 once shocked the national consciousness when police beat and tear - gassed 600 civil rights marchers as they crossed the @entity97 on their way to @entity99			1
the day became known as @entity100 and led the way to the @entity102			0
a movie depiction of the @entity2 story will release nationwide on january 9			0
@entity2 , said @entity83 , has come a long way since then , but black people are not yet free of injustices			0
she has led the charge in recent weeks , marching from @entity2 's famed @entity97 while yelling , " hands up ! do n't shoot ! " and " i ca n't breathe ! " -- in reference to the deaths of @entity113 in @entity80 and @entity114 in @entity115			0
added to the mix in @entity2 has been this chorus : " show the tape ! " police chief @entity119 said he takes no issue with protests tied to the tensions roiling through the country			1
what happened in @entity80 and @entity115 bothers him , too			0
" we have things going on in policing that are n't right , " he said			0
if people want to scream outside his department , " i ca n't breathe , " he 's all for it			0
but what riles him is how what happened in @entity2 is being lumped with these cases			0
" it 's wrong and disingenuous , " he said			0
" we 're no @entity80 , " and pretending @entity2 is , he said , " hurts the message			0
" @entity138 said it was her husband , @entity142 sen. @entity140 , who was responsible for $ 30,000 in funding for the city of @entity2 to buy lapel cameras for the police force			1
she has called for a public release of the video showing the shooting of @entity13 , calling it a " matter of transparency			1
" " they let @entity4 see [ the tape ] before me			1
i need to see the tape , as an attorney and a citizen , " @entity83 said			0
" if there 's any doubt that the killing was justified , we would demand that the @entity164 reconvene the grand jury			0
" @entity119 , the police chief , said the family should see it first			1
he said it would n't be easy to watch and that they deserved space to process it on their own			0
" i do n't care who 's jumping up and down , " @entity119 said			0
" we want the family to see it first			1
" @entity13 's children , who live in the @entity179 area , were able to see the video several hours after family members in @entity2 did			1
they , too , walked away troubled and wanting more answers			0
@entity183 called it " inconclusive , " and his brother , @entity185 , complained about editing			0
he said the video was choppy and skipped from one place to another			1
" we need more information to move forward , to have closure , " @entity185 said			0
civil rights attorney @entity193 , who said he has been working with the family to obtain the videotape since june , said he will be contacting the @entity2 police chief to demand the release of the lapel camera videos from the other two officers who were present			1
he also said the family wants to know the name of the officer who shot @entity0			1
" what we did learn from the video is that officer appeared to be poorly trained , " @entity193 said			2
" he put himself so close to mr. @entity0 that he escalated the situation			0
" the police chief said the officer is no longer on the force , but he did n't say why he left or where he 'd gone			2
lt. @entity212 , who has been with the department for nearly 28 years , said he knew of only two police shooting fatalities in all that time			2
with the police chief on vacation and out of town on the day of the viewing , it was @entity212 who showed the video to the family in @entity2			1
he also showed it to @entity4			1
when asked questions , he could only say , " no comment			2
" @entity138 raised other questions , too			2
she said that while there may have been witnesses who said they saw @entity13 rushing the officer , there was also a witness who said she saw no such thing			1
resident @entity234 said she and her daughter were on their front porch when she saw police following @entity0 through her yard			2
she pointed to the place in front of her home where she said the officer shot the man dead			2
@entity246 said she did n't see him raise the hatchet			0
she said he was n't threatening anyone			2
but @entity246 was never called to testify before the grand jury , @entity83 said			0
why is that ? district attorney @entity251 had an answer			0
he said @entity246 was not called because her words would not have changed the video			2
" what 's the point ? " he said			0
" you can bring in 50 witnesses and it would not change what the tape clearly shows			0
" though the police force has since acquired @entity265 , officers did n't have them at the time			2
" the officer only had one choice , " @entity251 said			0
but @entity0 said there was no reason for the police to give his brother chase			2
" they flushed him out like a rabbit " and treated his brother like " a nobody , " he said			0
" life beat him down , but he was a good man			0
