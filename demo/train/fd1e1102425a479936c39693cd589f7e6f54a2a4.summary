@entity1 wines have long been appreciated by even the snobbiest of sommeliers , and now harder drinks from the country are also making a name for themselves			1
spirits from @entity1 are winning awards around the world , and a little more than an hour from @entity11 , lies a region -- rich in herbs and grain -- that could explain the secret to that success			1
" the @entity24 i think is the ideal place to make spirits , " says @entity17 , the process manager at the @entity19 , known for its @entity21 's @entity20 -- the country 's first single grain whisky			1
" we make whisky the same way as @entity29 , " explains @entity17 , " but that is not necessarily the same throughout the world			1
you can get so many different flavors and styles			0
" supplementary spirits and whisky is n't the only alcoholic fruit from this region			2
even within the @entity24 there 's a variety of tastes from the grapes and the way they are distilled			1
@entity44 is one area that has grown grapes for centuries , and is the home of prolific brandy makers @entity49			2
" we 've got the 12 - year old , it 's one of my favorites , " explains @entity50 , marketing manager at @entity49			2
" you look at the color , it 's nice and amber , it 's got that nice glow to it			0
" bitter brandy though brandy - making has been a main endeavor , the company is branching out			0
" @entity65 in @entity1 actually carries a bit of stigma , " @entity50 explains			1
he says that at its peak @entity1 produced 55 million liters , but that has now declined to less than 30 million liters			1
" that volume has practically gone almost completely into whisky , " says @entity50			0
this shift is partly due to aspects of the drink that ca n't be tasted			0
@entity50 says @entity1 consumers are looking for the image associated with high quality -- and they are willing to pay for that			2
when brandy failed to take off with these drinkers , the company turned to cognac -- a bold move considering the drink can only come from @entity84			0
" really , the only difference between cognac and brandy is the region it comes from , " says @entity50			0
" to be called a cognac , your grapes have to be picked in @entity92 , in the western region of @entity84 , and you 've got to bottle and mature in @entity92			0
so what we did is we formed a unique partnership with a cognac house and now we 're the first @entity1 company to brand and then sell @entity92			2
" but in bringing the @entity1 touch to @entity92 , @entity49 is n't just trying to offer new bottles and tastes			2
the company 's ceo , @entity103 , is focused on broadening their consumer base			0
" you can start with a three - year old @entity49 brandy , but you can drink all the way up to a 30 - year - old and then we got a cognac , " @entity106 der @entity107 explains			1
" we want to give people an experience for any drinking occasion , " he continues			0
" [ it is ] not for every pocket , but for every occasion there should be a product which you could enjoy			0
" wide whisky world bringing the celebrated @entity84 drink to @entity1 may be one way for a @entity1 brand to grow its market share , but some @entity1 whisky makers are looking to other markets for growth			1
" we are slowly exporting , " explains @entity17 from @entity19			0
" in @entity1 , it 's quite exciting for us , we see @entity21 's [ whisky ] having a huge potential there , and we also are releasing small volumes in @entity133 and the @entity134			1
" and there is some evidence forays into foreign territories could prove successful			0
the @entity1 " @entity139 " bourbon was awarded a gold medal at this year 's @entity141 , the first @entity1 whisky to do so			1
but if brands like these want to make a dent in the wider @entity1 market , they are going up against big competition			1
according to the @entity151 , exports of @entity149 to @entity150 increased by 34 % to £ 6.6 million ( $ 10.3 million ) in the first half of this year			1
but this is n't the only @entity1 country enjoying a sip of the golden nectar			2
exports to @entity158 in the same period jumped by 89 % to £ 253,386 and the @entity160 market grew 68 % to £ 326,386			2
in fact , @entity161 , market analyst at @entity162 , describes the @entity1 whisky market as " miniscule " in the global picture , making up just 0.21 % of global exports in 2013			1
" while @entity1 whisky has been growing in recent years it has almost exclusively been taking place in @entity1 , " he explains			1
" producers like @entity171 are beginning to export to the rest of @entity173 and this may be the one region where @entity1 whisky can enjoy some success			1
however ... this will be limited by competition from @entity149 , @entity179 and @entity180 at the top and cheap but hugely successful @entity182 whiskies at the bottom			0
" small scale production yet , such questions of worldwide expansion are less of a worry for some of @entity1 's enthusiastic independent producers chasing that perfect blend rather than bumper profits			2
part botanist , part foodie , @entity192 makes gin , absinthe , vodka and more on the fringes of the @entity199			0
" we are blessed with a wonderful climate ample water here in the @entity24 so it 's like a growth paradise , " @entity192 explains			1
" what we try to do is to allow our products that come through our hand on process , to actually express that and we want to represent where we live ... people are drawn to that and we try and keep our offering as fresh and as varied as we possibly can			0
and that in itself is a joy			0
