in a telephone call monday between @entity2 's defense minister general @entity0 and the @entity3 secretary of defence @entity4 , @entity0 described the activity of @entity3 and @entity8 troops near @entity2 's border as " unprecedented			1
" according to the official @entity2 version of the call , his @entity3 counterpart assured him the alliance did not have " provocative or expansionist " intentions -- and that @entity2 should know this			2
but it hardly seems to matter how often @entity8 makes these assurances			2
the @entity17 will never trust them			0
fear of the @entity22 military alliance 's steady march east is deep - rooted			2
it strikes at the very heart of @entity2 's national sense of security , a relic of @entity29 enmity which has seeped down to post-soviet generations			1
@entity31 is a 15 - year - old pupil at the @entity33 cadet school in @entity33			1
he thinks long and hard when i ask him about @entity8			0
" i think @entity8 might be a friend to @entity2 but there 's one point i do n't understand : why it needs to approach the border with @entity2 more and more , " he says			1
cadet school is an education in patriotism , like something from a bygone era			1
besides the regular classes , there are lessons in ballroom dancing			0
teenage cadets proudly leading local beauties through the waltz while outside their classmates rehearse the goosestep			0
after the takeover of @entity56 , @entity3 secretary of state @entity54 accused @entity2 of behaving in a 19th century fashion in the 21st century			1
in some ways it 's an epithet that seems to ring true here			0
the children are immaculately mannered and thoughtful			0
they write to their fellow cadets in @entity56			0
they say they feel sad there 's this tension between brother nations -- @entity2 and @entity68			2
" people still do n't realize that war means despair and grief , " says 16 - year - old @entity69			0
" they ca n't find a compromise because people 's interests become involved and that 's where the problem lies			0
" @entity2 and @entity8 have never been able to find much of a compromise			1
@entity2 's repeated stance is that after @entity84 reunification , promises were made that @entity8 would never expand eastward -- and were promptly broken			1
@entity8 says this is simply not true			0
" no such pledge was made , and no evidence to back up @entity2 's claims has ever been produced , " the alliance wrote in an april fact sheet entitled " @entity2 's accusations -- setting the record straight			2
" @entity8 says it has tried hard to make @entity2 a " privileged partner			1
" it has worked together with @entity2 on a range of issues from counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics to submarine rescue and emergency planning			0
@entity8 says that fundamentally @entity2 's @entity100 rhetoric is an attempt to " divert attention away from its actions " in @entity68			1
now all cooperation is off the table			0
" from the @entity2 side , that @entity8 - @entity2 cooperation was just a camouflage , " says @entity106 of @entity2 think tank , the @entity108 and @entity110 studies			1
" after the @entity29 @entity2 tried several times to become a member and the @entity3 always said , ' it 's not going to happen			2
' " he quotes @entity118 , @entity8 's first secretary general , on the object of @entity8 's existence : " to keep the @entity2 out , the @entity3 in and the @entity84 down			1
" @entity2 president @entity121 declared at his annual direct call with the @entity2 people that part of his reasoning for annexing @entity56 was to protect @entity126 , home of @entity2 's @entity128 fleet , from ever falling into @entity8 's hands			1
" if we do n't do anything , @entity68 will be drawn into @entity8 sometime in the future			0
we 'll be told : " this does n't concern you , " and @entity8 ships will dock in @entity126 , the city of @entity2 's naval glory , " he said			1
@entity68 's prime minister @entity137 has said @entity68 accession to @entity8 is not a priority			2
the nation is currently in such a state of disarray that @entity8 membership seems unimaginable			0
but a membership action plan was discussed for both @entity68 and @entity145 at the @entity146 in 2008			0
it was put on hold			0
but @entity121 does not forget			0
" ever since ( former @entity68 president @entity152 ) @entity151 fled his country and a @entity22 government took power in his country , of course this is something [ @entity121 ] could n't stop thinking about , " says @entity149 of the @entity150			0
" so for him , to prevent @entity68 from becoming part of the western orbit if not of @entity8 , was something he absolutely can not afford			0
" this is why the rotation of 600 @entity3 troops , small as it is , through the @entity165 and @entity166 for joint - training exercises is such an affront for @entity2			0
this is why it is perhaps not strictly fair to accuse @entity2 of just engaging in propaganda when it declares its mistrust of @entity8			1
@entity106 says he feels that the general public 's attitude to the alliance has worsened since the end of the @entity29			1
then , people were able to dismiss the @entity17 's line towards @entity8 as @entity181 propaganda , he says			2
" a store of unsuccessful mishaps in relations between @entity2 and the @entity22 after the end of the @entity29 has contributed to a rise in suspicions on the @entity2 side to @entity22 policy in general and @entity8 in particular			1
" that 's one of the reasons @entity121 's popularity has soared since the annexation of @entity56			1
there is a feeling among the general public that , at last , @entity2 is standing up for its rights in the post-soviet space where it has sat maligned for decades			1
much as the @entity17 likes to nurture that narrative , it is also easy to see why it resonates with the @entity2 public .			2

in cadet school , @entity2 pupils have *questions* for @entity8
they ask : why do you need to be on our border
@entity121 used *strategic* military reasoning to annexe @entity56
among general public , there 's a feeling that @entity2 is at last standing up for its rights
