-- may 23 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : your school probably has fire drills , tornado drills			2
but how should you prepare for zombies ? ! believe it or not , the government has an answer			1
this is @entity0 ! first up : violence in @entity4 @entity28 : first up today , deadly violence in @entity4 , as a string of bombings hits the @entity5 capital			1
fifteen explosions went off within hours of each other on sunday			2
@entity5 authorities said the mix of car bombs and roadside bombs killed at least 18 people and wounded at least 80 others			1
there 's been an increase recently of violence in @entity5			1
that includes yesterday 's attacks			1
it 's raising some concerns about whether or not @entity5 security forces will be able to protect their own country			1
@entity50 pulled the last of its combat troops out of @entity5 yesterday , and @entity54 troops are scheduled to leave @entity5 by the start of next year , though @entity5 leaders might ask them to stay longer			1
just the facts @entity58 , @entity15 : just the facts ! there is a history of conflict between @entity6 and the @entity64 people			1
the areas at the center of that conflict are @entity67 and the @entity68			2
@entity6 took control of these areas in 1967 during the six - day @entity70			1
right now , around 4 million @entity64 live in @entity67 and the @entity68			2
leadership differences @entity28 : for decades , there have been attempts to make peace between the @entity6 and @entity64			1
president @entity75 tried to push for a new start to peace talks in a speech he gave last week			0
during that speech , he mentioned going back to the pre- 1967 war borders , but with exchanges in land that both sides would agree on			0
the idea did not go over well with @entity6 's prime minister			1
yesterday , president @entity75 explained what he meant when he gave a speech to @entity89 , the @entity89			0
he told the conference that the pre- 1967 borders should be a starting point for negotiations , and that he expects @entity6 and the @entity64 to work together to define new borders			1
part of the reason the @entity54 is so involved in what 's going on in @entity6 is that the two countries are very close allies			1
the @entity54 has supported @entity6 since it was founded in 1948			1
but as @entity101 explains , that friendship was pretty tense late last week			0
( begin video ) @entity101 , @entity0 @entity103 : @entity6 prime minister @entity104 was about to leave for the @entity54 when president @entity75 made the announcement that infuriated him			1
@entity75 , @entity106 : we believe the borders of @entity6 and @entity109 should be based on the 1967 lines wiith mutually agreed swaps			1
@entity112 : at the @entity113 friday , @entity104 panned the proposal			0
@entity115 , @entity6 @entity116 : these lines are indefensible because they do n't take into account certain changes that have taken place on the ground , demographic changes that have taken place over the last 44 years			1
@entity124 : after the initial war of words , the @entity113 hoped the meeting would be a time to kiss and make up			0
@entity75 : obviously , there are some differences between us , the precise formulations and language			0
and that 's going to happen between friends			1
@entity135 : we have an enduring bond of friendship between our two countries			0
@entity124 : but for all of the niceties , @entity104 drew a line in the sand , and not only on a return to pre- 1967 borders			0
he said @entity6 will not negotiate with a @entity64 government supported by @entity145 or house @entity64 refugees			1
@entity135 : that 's not going to happen			1
everybody knows it 's not going to happen , and i think it 's time to tell the @entity64 forthrightly that it 's not going to happen			1
@entity124 : despite tough words , the @entity54 and @entity6 will remain allies , even past this rough spot			1
but the tension between the two leaders was palpable			1
after the president 's meeting with @entity104 , @entity113 press secretary @entity158 was peppered with questions about the disagreement on the borders issue			1
he said the president made clear the pre- 1967 border proposal is a starting point , that the mutual swaps that would create the eventual borders would be negotiated			0
the thing is , what the @entity113 considers a starting point , @entity6 still considers a non-starter , even after the meeting			1
@entity174 , @entity0 , @entity175			0
( @entity176 ) trip to @entity178 @entity28 : president @entity75 is working on some other alliances this week			0
he 's heading to @entity178 to visit four countries there			1
today , he lands in @entity181 , @entity182 to meet with that nation 's leaders			1
tomorrow , the president travels to @entity186 , where he 'll talk with @entity50 prime minister @entity187 and address the @entity50 @entity188			1
then it 's off to @entity190 for the @entity191			1
that 's a meeting of world economic powers			1
and the last stop : @entity195 , @entity196			0
president @entity75 will meet with the @entity196 president and visit some of @entity196 's historic sites			1
today , the president plans to take a side trip to visit some of his personal history : an @entity182 village where president @entity75 's great - great - great - grandfather lived			1
@entity204 @entity28 : from @entity182 , we 're hopping across the @entity206 to @entity7			0
something happening there might not affect president @entity75 's travel plans , but it was certainly having an impact on @entity7 yesterday			1
a volcano erupted over the weekend ; it sent a cloud of ash up into the sky			0
no flights were allowed in or out of the country 's four international airports			1
this is one of the most active volcanoes in @entity7			0
local media said it last erupted in 2004			0
last year , another @entity7 volcano eruption -- you might remember this -- caused air travel problems across all of @entity178			1
one official said she does n't think this new eruption will have that kind of impact , although she said it 's hard to predict how the ash cloud might move			1
@entity232 @entity233 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity236 's 6th grade classes at @entity237 in @entity238 , @entity239 ! who performed the first @entity54 spacewalk ? you know what to do ! was it : a ) @entity248 , b ) @entity249 , @entity251 ) @entity246 or @entity247 ) @entity245 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity248 floated out of his @entity254 capsule and into history in 1965			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity259 @entity28 : @entity248 's spacewalk in 1965 lasted 23 minutes			1
he said it was n't nearly long enough			0
he might have preferred yesterday 's spacewalk at the international space station			2
that one lasted more than eight hours ! it was the sixth - longest spacewalk ever and the second one on this mission for the crew of the space shuttle @entity269			0
this was the mission 's first spacewalk			2
happened back on friday ; lasted a little over six hours			2
you really get a good view of the astronauts moving around out there			0
what they 've been doing is some routine maintenance			0
that includes working on a two - armed robot that will eventually take care of some of the work that astronauts are doing now			0
there are two more spacewalks planned for @entity269 's mission			2
@entity289 @entity28 : from walking in space to the walking dead			0
you do n't hear much about this on @entity0			0
we 're talking about a zombie apocalypse , and it brought down the @entity298 's website last week			2
that is because -- as a joke -- the @entity298 posted a zombie survival plan			0
and it was heavy traffic that crashed the internet site			0
the living dead might be taking over pop culture , but the government agency does n't think there 's any real threat from zombies			1
so we can all breathe easier			0
the reason it posted the survival plan was to raise awareness about preparing for disasters			0
the @entity298 says preparing for zombies would pretty much be the same as preparing for hurricanes or widespread disease			2
that includes stocking up on food , water , medicine ; and having a battery - powered radio , plus some changes of clothes			0
blog report @entity28 : well , what 's more fun than exams ? anything ! but here are some tips that students have for getting through them			1
@entity334 tries to write everything down on paper and put a little drawing next to it , making it colorful			0
the color helps her absorb information better			0
@entity342 suggests this : record yourself reading the material , then listen to it every day in the morning and evening			2
it 's like your own personal teacher			2
@entity350 's method : " i use flash cards because they help me memorize things better			2
" @entity353 says , " i review what i 've learned right after class to have impressions of what 's covered and what 's important			2
before tests , i just skim through the materials			0
" @entity361 likes things quiet			0
" it seems i can fit more into my head when i 'm not distracted			0
" reading the textbook and making a song throughout the chapter works for @entity368			0
@entity369 goes to a certain room in his house and picks out something in that room to remember the information when he 's taking the test			2
and @entity377 connects different types of music to different subjects and then breaks it into songs that fit the genre			0
before we go @entity28 : before we go , a new museum invites visitors to dive in , ' cause that 's the only way they can get there			2
it claims to be the world 's largest underwater museum			2
it 's located off the coast of @entity394 , @entity395			2
the sculptures are made out of a special kind of cement that encourages coral reefs and marine life to grow			0
so if you visit several times , it 'll actually look different each time			0
of course , if you do n't know to expect the changes , it might throw you for a loop			0
goodbye @entity28 : we guess it 's a subject that deserves some in - depth exploration			2
you only have so long to make puns about underwater museums before the statue of limitations runs out			0
all right ! before we run out of time , we want to give a special shoutout to all you graduating seniors out there			0
just two weeks left before we wrap up our school year			2
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity25 .			0

find out what happened in @entity5 on the day when @entity50 's combat troops left
