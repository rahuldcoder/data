@entity0 -- president @entity2 on thursday said that the recent events surrounding the deaths of two black men at the hands of white police officers underscore that " too many @entity8 feel deep unfairness " with respect to the criminal justice system			1
" when it comes , as we 've seen unfortunately in recent days , to our criminal justice system , too many @entity8 feel deep unfairness when it comes to the gap between our professed ideals and how the laws are applied on a day to day basis , " he said during an address during the @entity14 's @entity13			1
the @entity24 decision not to indict the police officer who killed @entity26 , an @entity27 father of six , sparked protests throughout @entity29 and across the nation wednesday night , just over a week after another acquittal in the death of a black teen at the hands of a white police officer prompted similar unrest across the nation			0
@entity2 said he called @entity29 mayor @entity38 on wednesday night to commend him for the way he 's handled protests that erupted in the city			0
the events have inspired a nationwide discussion surrounding race and the criminal justice system , and prompted @entity2 to host community leaders and elected officials at his office monday to discuss solutions to the problem			2
on thursday , he again pledged to continue working to find a way to tackle the issues with law enforcement in the coming months			0
but he characterized the challenge ahead as greater than simply reforming the criminal justice system and restoring a sense of justice â € ” rather , @entity2 said , there 's a need to restore " a sense of common purpose " in @entity8			1
" at the heart of the @entity27 ideal is this sense that we 're in it together , that nobody is guaranteed success but everybody 's got access to the possibilities of success , and that we are willing to work not just to make sure our own children have pathways to success , but that everybody does , " he said .			0
