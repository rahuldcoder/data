-- a @entity2 front - page article monday detailed a new phenomenon in news coverage of the presidential campaign : candidates insisting on " quote approval , " telling reporters what they can and can not use in some stories			1
and , stunningly , reporters agreeing to it			1
this , folks , is news			2
any way you look at it , this is a jaw - dropping turn in journalism , and it raises a lot of questions			0
among them : can you trust the reporters and news organizations who do this ? is it ever justified on the candidate 's side or on the reporter 's side ? where is this leading us ? as someone who 's been covering presidential campaigns since the 1950s , i have no delusions about political reporting			1
candidates bargaining access to get the kind of news coverage they want is nothing new			1
the thicket of attribution and disclosure deals is a deep maze reporters have been picking their way through even before my time			1
but this latest tactic by candidates revealed by the @entity2 gives me , to say the least , great pause			2
it should give every citizen pause			0
essentially , what the @entity2 described was the rapid rise of " quote approval " -- a strategy deployed by campaigns requiring reporters to send quotations they intend to use to candidates ' press officers , to be sliced , diced , edited and drained of color or unwanted consequences , and reporters going along , fearing that if they do n't , they wo n't get access			1
a look at media coverage of @entity71 's @entity70 pain here 's how it works : let 's say a reporter is granted an interview with a senior strategist of the @entity78 or @entity71 campaign			2
a condition for the interview would be that before the reporter could send the story to the editor , he or she would have to agree to submit for approval every quote intended to be used to the campaign press staff			1
let us mark well this faustian bargain			2
it is for the benefit of the politicians , at the expense of readers , listeners and viewers			0
it is not in the public interest ; it is designed to further the candidates ' interests			2
political operatives can not be blamed for wanting this			0
we , the press , should be held accountable for letting them have it			0
@entity108 said : " the only security of all is in a free press			0
" a free and truly independent press -- fiercely independent when necessary -- is the red beating heart of freedom and democracy			0
one of the most important roles of our journalists is to be watchdogs			0
submitting to these new tactics puts us more in the category of lapdogs			0
for many years , it has been typical journalistic practice for high - ranking officials on the campaign or in the @entity125 to demand that interviews be conducted " on background " -- meaning reporters agree to not use direct quotes or identify the person by name			1
hence , conventions such as " as one campaign official said ... " this , in many cases , is defensible			0
@entity137 's " @entity136 but the practice described in the @entity2 is something new and different			0
this is the officials or candidates regularly insisting that reporters essentially become an operative arm of the administration or campaign they are covering			1
" @entity153 approval " nullifies , or at least seriously dilutes , reporters ' ability and duty to be honest brokers of information			1
when the quotes are sanitized , then delivered intact with full attribution , the public has no way of knowing what the concealed deal was			2
please know that there is no joy in calling attention to these things			0
i respect and empathize with reporters and editors who must compete in today 's environment			2
and i know full well that when i 've been covering campaigns , which i still do , i 've made my mistakes and have been far from perfect			0
about all of us doing this line of work , i 'm often reminded of a sign in an old @entity176 cow town saloon that said , " please do n't shoot the piano player , he 's doing the best he can			0
" but we journalists can do better			0
@entity180 @entity181 , the excellent managing editor for news at the @entity2 , said in monday 's story , referring to quote approval : " we do n't like the practice			1
we encourage our reporters to push back			1
unfortunately , this practice is becoming increasingly common , and maybe we have to push back harder			1
the @entity2 , @entity188 , @entity189 and a few other newspapers , along with the major networks , are among the few news outlets that have the leverage to push back -- soon and hard			1
it 's action worthy of us			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			1

reporters are agreeing to let candidates *vet* their quotes before they appear in stories
@entity200 : allowing candidates to edit their quotes makes reports *fraudulent*
by making this " bargain " for access , he says , reporters essentially become pr agents
rather : newspapers and media outlets must push back on " quote approval "
