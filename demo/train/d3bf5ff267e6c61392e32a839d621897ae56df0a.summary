in his first - ever interview as the emir of @entity3 , @entity2 defended his country against allegations of funding terrorism and pledged support for the fight against @entity9 for the long haul			1
" we do n't fund extremists , " the @entity2 told @entity12 's @entity11 on thursday			1
" if you talk about certain movements , especially in @entity16 and @entity17 , we all consider them terrorist movement			2
" " i know that in @entity22 and some countries they look at some movements as terrorist movements			2
... but there are differences			2
there are differences that some countries and some people that any group which comes from @entity31 background are terrorists			1
and we do n't accept that			0
" it would be a " big mistake , " he said , to consider every @entity31 movement to be " extremists			1
" the @entity3 government itself has long been criticized for hosting and financing @entity31 extremists in @entity16 and elsewhere ; an @entity45 diplomat has even gone so far as to call the country , " @entity47 for terrorists			1
" nonetheless , the small , but rich @entity50 nation has become a key member of the @entity22 - led effort to route @entity9 in @entity16			1
the country hosts one of the largest @entity22 military bases in the @entity56			2
@entity3 , like other coalition countries , will " stay in it for a while , " the @entity2 , 34 , told @entity11			1
" we 've been asked by our @entity22 friends if we can join , and we did			0
" who is the enemy ? there are some crucial differences in @entity3 's approach to the chaos in @entity16 , and @entity22 's			1
the @entity69 administration has said explicitly that while @entity70 , @entity16 's brutal strongman , has lost all legitimacy , he is no longer a priority			0
@entity3 could not disagree more			1
" the main cause of all this is the regime in @entity16 , and this regime should be punished , " the @entity2 said			1
" we 've been saying that from day one , that if we do n't stop the bloodshed in @entity16 and we do n't stop @entity70 committing genocide on his own people , this is where we 're going to reach			0
" " unfortunately , we are in a situation now that the @entity16 people , who demanded for their freedom , are between a regime , brutal regime , and terrorist acts			0
" " if we think that we 're going to get rid of the terrorist movements and leave those regimes doing what -- this regime especially , doing what he is doing -- then terrorist movements will come back again			2
" @entity22 has now done what president @entity69 so long wanted to avoid -- intervention in the @entity16 war			2
but it remains very unlikely that he would expand the mission to combat the @entity70 regime			0
would @entity3 , @entity11 asked , expand its mission in @entity16 to do after the regime ? " @entity3 can not do that by itself , of course			1
if there is a coalition that will help and protect the @entity16 people , we will be part of it			0
" a troubled region @entity3 's relationship with @entity16 , of course , is from the only the only source of controversy in its foreign policy			1
during the @entity117 , many accused @entity3 of backing the @entity118 in @entity119 and the @entity3 - run cable news network @entity120 of instigating unrest around the @entity56			1
the emir contended that far from playing sides , @entity3 backed every @entity119 government since @entity125 stepped down			1
he did acknowledge that many members of the @entity118 , who have fled @entity119 en masse , have been offered shelter in @entity3			1
" many of them left and some of them came to @entity3 because they were traveling and they were afraid			1
" " some of them are still there , " he said			0
" they know the rules of the country -- that as long as you 're here , you ca n't practice politics against any other @entity140 country			1
" @entity3 is also a vocal supporter of @entity142 , the @entity143 organization , which controls @entity144 and which the @entity22 considers a terrorist organization			1
@entity11 asked whether @entity3 would continue its support of @entity142			2
" we support all @entity143 people			0
we believe @entity142 is a very important part of the @entity143 people			0
" " what is the difference between @entity142 10 years ago and @entity142 now ? i believe the difference is that @entity142 are more realistic now			0
they believe in peace and they want peace			0
but it 's for the other party to believe in peace as well and to be more realistic			0
" a troubled @entity160 nothing shows @entity3 's desire to have its moment in the sun better than its successful bid to host the @entity160 in 2022			1
it would be the first @entity118 country to do so			2
the bid has been mired in controversy , amid allegations of bribery and horrific labor conditions for those building the stadiums and infrastructure			0
@entity3 's scorching summer weather has also been a source of considerable tension ; some have suggested that the tournament should be moved to the winter , though that would wreak havoc on soccer league schedules around the world			1
" people should understand that @entity3 had the best bid , and @entity3 will provide and will do one of the best @entity187 in history , " the @entity2 said			1
" and i 'm sure about that			0
" " people do n't want to accept , do n't want to realize that a small country , @entity140 , @entity118 country , can host a big event like that			2
" the @entity194 says that well over 1,000 migrant workers have died in @entity3 since construction began , and 4,000 could be dead by the time the @entity160 starts			1
" yes , it 's true -- we had problems , " the @entity2 said			2
" we 're solving the problems			0
we 're enforcing the laws -- it 's not acceptable			0
" " we changed the laws			0
they are enforced and there are many laws that have been changed			0
and i 'm telling you because i am personally hurt about the situation			0
" when asked by @entity11 , the @entity2 said that the laws would " definitely " be enforced , and workers would " definitely " get paid their fair wage			2
" all the media is concentrating on @entity3 due to the @entity160 , " he said			1
" if we have problems i do n't mind the talking about problems			0
but also we need to talk other -- about other things , about those laws that we did			0
" in order protect players from the heat of @entity3 's summer , the country is development complex air conditioning systems for its stadiums			1
" we have this technology for ten years now and it 's working in ... one of our stadiums			0
" " one hundred percent it will be working " for the @entity228 , he said			0
and what of the suggestion that the @entity160 be moved to winter ? " our bid was for it to be in summer , " he said			2
" at the end , it 's up to the @entity233 to decide when is the best time			0
" " we 're ready for both			2

world makes too many generalizations about @entity31 movements , he says
@entity2 says @entity3 is prepared for long fight against @entity9
emir claims his country will be ready to host 2022 @entity160
