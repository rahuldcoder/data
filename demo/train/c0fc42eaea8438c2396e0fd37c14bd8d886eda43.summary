-- @entity1 enjoyed a tennis career that would be the envy of most women on the @entity4 , but it is not a path she would like for her four - year - old daughter			1
the @entity8 has topped the world rankings , celebrated four grand slam triumphs and earned over $ 24 million in prize money before calling time on her glittering career at this year 's @entity13 , but she hopes daughter @entity14 can find a profession away from the court			1
" i 'm not the kind of person where i want her to be like me and want her to have a career like me , " the 29 - year - old told @entity0 's @entity18 in her homeland , where she was staging an event to thank her compatriots for their support over the last 15 years			1
" she plays a bit , she 's at the club that i own with a friend every wednesday , she goes there just for the social side of things			2
there 's so many kids she plays with -- when the tennis is over they go to the playground or the cafeteria			1
" it 's just fun to see her have a social life and be among friends while playing sports			2
whether it 's swimming , track and field or tennis , i 'll support her whatever she wants to do			2
" but i 'm not going to be the mother that 's like , ' we 're going to play tennis , we 're going to practice this and this shot ' -- i 'm not like that at all			1
" @entity1 ' " @entity52 " in @entity53 , an exhibition tournament also featuring fellow former world no. 1s @entity55 and @entity57 , were a way for her to thank the @entity8 public for 15 years of goodwill			1
" it was a way for me to give back for all the support i got from the people here , " she said			0
" the last 15 years i 've had so many letters and presents and people who travel all over the world to watch me play , so i needed to say goodbye to the people here in @entity8			1
" she chose @entity57 and @entity55 because they were two of her best friends on tour			0
" @entity57 , what she 's done for women 's tennis has been incredible			2
i 've always admired her for who she is as a person , " @entity1 said			2
" @entity55 as well , besides the fact she was a great player i appreciate the person she was on tour for her whole career -- she stayed normal			0
there was no difference seeing @entity55 the next day if you beat her or lost to her			0
that 's something i really appreciated			0
" she was one of the people i got closer to -- i reached out to her when her dad passed away and she reached out to me when my dad passed away			0
" the @entity92 native initially retired in 2007 , taking two years out of the sport to have her child before returning in 2009			0
she won that year 's @entity13 as a wildcard , becoming the first mother to clinch a major championship since @entity99 's @entity98 in 1980			1
" i enjoyed spending time with my husband and our daughter on the road , seeing her at my last @entity13 -- she was in the stands and she watched and she would clap			1
i would hear her yell and i really enjoyed it , " @entity1 said			2
that win has become famous for the on - court celebration between mother and daughter , and @entity1 ranks the victory as the most emotional of her career -- coming less than a year after the death of her father			1
" one of my biggest highlights is the @entity13 victory when i came back , " she explained			2
" nine months before my dad passed away and the surprise to have won ... it was like an emotional rollercoaster			0
" she went to @entity120 this year determined to savor the occasion , playing in the singles , doubles and mixed doubles competitions while also watching as a fan as @entity126 ended his career during the grand slam event			1
" i felt so excited about it , like a 14 - year - old again playing my first tour event and going to @entity132 for the first time , " @entity1 said			1
" i was so excited knowing it could be one of my last matches but at the same time i was taking it all in			0
i told myself leading up to the @entity13 that you 're gon na step back once in a while and look at the situation from another kind of angle			2
" now that i think back , those 15 years have flown by			0
it 's sad in a way that you do n't think about it when you 're 16 or 17 -- which in a way is normal , but in the last year i was on tour i learned more than in the last 15 in total			2
" that 2009 triumph was one of three she achieved at @entity152 , while she also won the @entity153			0
her exploits raised the profile of tennis in @entity8 , and her rivalry with @entity158 was keenly fought , with @entity1 winning 13 of their 25 meetings -- although @entity158 won all three of their grand slam final matches			1
@entity158 retired from the sport in 2011 , also for the second time , and this year announced she is expecting her first child -- due to be born next march			2
@entity1 said that only since retiring has she been able to see what their achievements meant to @entity8 tennis fans			1
" now that i 'm older i 'm able to realize what we did for our country , especially in the last few months since i retired , i 've been in situations where people have come up to me and thanked me , " she said			0
" when world leaders and politicians i 've met say what you 've done for @entity8 , that 's when it really hits you			1
" she was also touched that the @entity8 media made a special presentation to her after that final match in september -- a second - round defeat to one of the women 's game 's rising stars , @entity190 18 - year - old @entity189			1
" it 's such a small country , we 're very approachable			0
we do n't have paparazzi , so we 're among the people , " @entity1 said			2
" they said i have to come in for another interview and i thought ' oh no , not another one			0
' they were all standing there ... it really got to me			0
the thought they put into it was very nice			0
" one lingering regret is that she never reached the final at @entity204 , losing in the semis in 2006 and the quarters in 2010			0
" the match that hurt me the most was that loss to @entity209 ( in 2010 )			0
at the time it took me a few weeks to get myself together and focus on what was next , " said @entity1 , who bounced back to win the @entity13 for the third time later that year , beating the @entity210 in the final			1
one of @entity1 ' trademarks was her athletic stretches across the court , flexibility which could perhaps be explained by the fact her mother was a gymnast			1
@entity1 , whose father was a professional footballer , enjoys the attention her quirky trademark brings			1
" it does make me laugh , " she said			0
" i have people send me pictures of splits they do to show me they can do it , so it is funny			0
" i think it started because i practiced on clay all of the time in @entity8 and then i just tried it one time on hard court and won the point and slowly started to feel more comfortable with it			1
now more players do it , so it 's not only me anymore			0
" so is there any chance of a third comeback ? @entity1 takes her time , then shakes her head			1
" no , i 'm done ! "			0

@entity1 would prefer her daughter not to play professional tennis
the four - time grand slam winner ended her career after this year 's @entity13
the @entity8 reached the top of the world rankings and earned over $ 24 million
