@entity0 -- the federal government moved thursday to seize assets belonging to the @entity4 and the @entity5 , including a @entity7 skyscraper and four mosques , citing alleged links to the @entity11 government			1
@entity12 , the @entity13 attorney for the @entity14 , announced thursday 's filing of an amended civil complaint seeking forfeiture of the @entity4 's interest in the 36 - story office tower located on @entity20 in @entity7			1
the tower is owned by 650 @entity23 , a partnership between the @entity4 and @entity5 , the @entity21 said			1
the amended complaint alleges that the @entity4 provided services to the @entity11 government and transferred money from 650 @entity23 to @entity28 , @entity11 's largest state - owned financial entity			1
@entity13 and @entity30 officials last year designated @entity28 as a proliferator for supporting @entity11 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and funneling money to the @entity35 and @entity36 , considered terrorist groups by the @entity13			1
@entity28 issued a statement last year denying involvement in any deceptive banking practices			0
thursday 's amended complaint seeks forfeiture of all assets of the @entity4 and @entity5 , including bank accounts owned by 650 @entity23 , the @entity4 and @entity5 ; and properties owned by the foundation in @entity0 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			1
it alleges that the properties were " involved in and [ were ] the proceeds of money laundering offenses , " and that the owners violated the @entity54 , executive orders and @entity13 @entity57 regulations			2
" as today 's complaint alleges in great detail , the @entity4 has effectively been a front for the government of @entity11 , " @entity12 said			1
" for two decades , the @entity4 's affairs have been directed by various @entity11 officials , including @entity11 ambassadors to the @entity67 , in violation of a series of @entity13 laws			1
the @entity4 's former president remains under investigation for alleged obstruction of justice , and both the criminal and civil investigations are ongoing			2
" @entity76 , a @entity0 lawyer representing the @entity4 , said his client would challenge the complaint			1
" we 're obviously disappointed that the government brought this action because we have been cooperating with the government since this investigation began about a year ago and we intend to litigate this matter , " he said in a telephone interview			0
" it may take some time , but at the end of this litigation , we 're of the mind that we 're going to prevail here			0
" the buildings remained open and were continuing to operate as usual			0
" there are no allegations of any wrongdoing on the part of any of these tenants or occupants , " said @entity90 , a spokesman for the @entity91 for the @entity14 in a written statement			0
" the tenants and occupants remain free to use the properties as they have before today 's filing			0
" according to the complaint , the @entity0 tower was built in the 1970s by a nonprofit organization operated by the @entity105 to pursue the country 's charitable interests in the @entity13			1
@entity28 financed its construction in prime real estate near @entity110			0
in 1979 , after the @entity11 revolution , the @entity111 of @entity11 established the @entity113 of @entity0 , since renamed the @entity4 , to take possession of and manage property it had expropriated from the former government , including the @entity20 building			1
calls to the @entity120 were not immediately returned			0
the mosques are in @entity0 , @entity47 , @entity50 and @entity49			2
at the @entity123 of @entity0 in @entity124 , two worshipers said they found out about the move thursday as they arrived for evening prayers			2
the front page of the court document stating the terms of the case was tacked to the front door accompanied by a letter from the @entity13 attorney 's office to the @entity113			1
a senior @entity21 official , trying to blunt any criticism from @entity137 groups , told reporters that the government is moving against the @entity11 landlords of the buildings , not targeting or " seizing mosques " as religious - oriented facilities			1
the mosques just happen to be among the tenants of the buildings in question , the official said			0
but , in a statement , the @entity149 called the move unprecedented and said it may have @entity153 implications			0
" whatever the details of the government 's case against the owners of the mosques , as a civil rights organization we are concerned that the seizure of @entity13 houses of worship could have a chilling effect on the religious freedom of citizens of all faiths and may send a negative message to @entity137 worldwide , " said @entity149 national communications director @entity154			1
he said the move comes at a bad time , given the community 's fear of a backlash resulting from a @entity137 psychiatrist being charged in the deadly shooting spree at @entity176 in @entity49			0
relations between @entity11 and much of the international community have been tense in recent years over @entity11 's nuclear ambitions			2
@entity11 states that it wants to develop its nuclear program solely for peaceful purposes ; the @entity13 and a number of other countries have said they suspect the oil - rich nation is pursuing a nuclear bomb			2
in another @entity13 - @entity11 development , president @entity188 said thursday in a letter to @entity191 that the national emergency with respect to @entity11 that was declared in 1979 during the @entity11 revolution has not ended			2
" our relations with @entity11 have not yet returned to normal , and the process of implementing the january 19 , 1981 , agreements with @entity11 is still under way , " @entity188 wrote in an official " notice of continuation " required to extend the emergency status with @entity11 beyond the anniversary date of november 14			0
" for these reasons , i have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared on november 14 , 1979 , with respect to @entity11 , beyond november 14 , 2009			0
" @entity1 's @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 contributed to this story .			0
