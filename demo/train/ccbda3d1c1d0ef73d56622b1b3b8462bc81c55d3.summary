-- shortly after president @entity1 tapped @entity2 in june 2009 to be the top commander in @entity4 , @entity0 reported that @entity2 would never let a reporter in the room during classified morning meetings he led among senior military officers			1
@entity2 was known in @entity9 for his discretion			1
he kept a low profile , briefly interrupted by two major news events			1
the general was criticized for the way he handled the circumstances of @entity18 soldier @entity17 's friendly fire death in @entity4 in 2004			1
in 2006 , @entity2 was lauded for the death of @entity20 , the leader of @entity21 in @entity22			1
the media spotlight on @entity2 this week , however , may be the hottest in the general 's storied military career			1
on tuesday , @entity2 flew from @entity4 to @entity9			1
his boss , president @entity1 , has asked the general to explain in person the derisive comments he and his aides made to a @entity32 reporter			1
the magazine 's profile on @entity2 , due out friday , depicts an angry , snarky and foulmouthed general lambasting how the war in @entity4 is being conducted			1
@entity2 does not directly criticize @entity1 in the article , but reporter @entity38 writes that the general and @entity1 " failed from the outset to connect " after the president took office			1
sources familiar with their first meeting said @entity2 thought @entity1 looked " uncomfortable and intimidated " by the room full of top military officials , according to the article			1
the journalist writes that an unnamed aide to @entity2 mocks vice president @entity49			1
" are you asking about vice president @entity49 ? ' " @entity2 says with a laugh			1
" who 's that ? @entity49 ? " suggests a top adviser			0
" ' did you say : @entity56 ? " @entity2 has n't denied the article 's accuracy			1
in a statement , he called his comments " a mistake " and apologized for " poor judgment			0
" the general has also fired a press aide over the article , two @entity64 sources told @entity0			0
@entity2 , a @entity68 graduate and former @entity69 , was a senior official on the staff of @entity71 adm. @entity72			1
between 2003 and 2008 , he was the commander of the highly clandestine @entity73 , which oversees the military 's most sensitive forces , including the @entity77 's @entity76			0
in 2009 , defense secretary @entity78 asked for the resignation of gen. @entity80 , the former @entity18 and @entity81 commander in @entity4			2
@entity2 would have " fresh eyes on the problem " in @entity4 , @entity78 said at the time			1
@entity2 has pushed a counterinsurgency strategy in @entity4 intended to empower the civilian population so much that the insurgency will slowly be demoralized , fractured and defeated			1
part of that plan means a prohibition in some areas on lethal air strikes and other attack methods so that civilian injuries and deaths can be avoided			0
some @entity18 service members have been critical of the move , arguing that the rules have left them vulnerable			0
in a july 2009 interview with @entity99 , @entity2 explained his approach			2
" first thing is , if you take a very small area , you have to try and figure out what is going on in that area			0
... it 's like knowing what is going on in your neighborhood , " he said			0
" not just the traffic on the road , but how money is made , who is running rule of law , who do they go to when they have dispute adjudication -- do they go to a @entity122 shadow court , a government of @entity4 official entity ? " " ... you have to get at the attitudes of the people			2
and that is why i say you have to immerse yourself in it and understand it before you can confidently assess it , " he told @entity99			0
just who the man is behind the strategy is tougher to assess			0
" he 's lanky , smart , tough , a sneaky stealth soldier , " maj. gen. @entity136 , a retired officer , told the @entity137 in may 2009			0
" he 's got all the @entity141 attributes , plus an intellect			0
" the @entity137 reported that @entity2 thrives on a few hours of sleep a night and often eats only one meal a day			2
he has for years been an avid distance runner			0
when he did a yearlong fellowship at the @entity146 in @entity147 , he reportedly ran 12 miles a day from his home in @entity149 to @entity150			0
@entity2 's last public apology came during his @entity153 confirmation hearing for the top post in @entity4			1
he said he was sorry for his role in the way the @entity64 handled @entity17 's death			0
@entity17 gave up an @entity159 contract to join the @entity77 and fight in @entity4			2
he was killed by friendly fire in 2004			0
a @entity64 investigation found that @entity2 was notified that the soldier was a victim of fratricide			2
but @entity17 's family said they were led to believe he was killed by insurgents			0
@entity17 's mother said last year that @entity2 knew at her son 's memorial service that he had died of friendly fire , but did not tell the family			2
she said @entity2 was " lying			2
" investigations by the @entity77 's @entity173 and the @entity64 's inspector general concluded that officers in @entity17 's chain of command knew almost immediately that he had been killed by fire from his own platoon			0
that information , however , was withheld from his family for more than a month , in violation of @entity77 regulations			0
@entity2 told the @entity183 that he helped expedite the @entity185 award for @entity17 before confirming that @entity17 was killed by friendly fire			2
the @entity77 did not take action against @entity2 .			2
