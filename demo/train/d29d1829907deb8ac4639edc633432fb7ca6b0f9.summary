some media outlets have reported that @entity1 has been strongly considering the possibility of a confession , possibly as a way to stem the tide of fleeing sponsors and as part of a long - term redemptive comeback plan			1
but such a confession might lend weight to the lawsuits that could await him			0
the interview will air at 9 p.m. et thursday on the @entity59			0
