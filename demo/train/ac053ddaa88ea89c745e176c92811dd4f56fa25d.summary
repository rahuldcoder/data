-- " @entity1 accused of roughing up photographer			1
" when i read this headline , my @entity4 reaction was : who would admit to being beaten up by @entity1 ? i think most of us would take that secret with us to our grave			1
for those unfamiliar with @entity1 -- if that 's even possible -- he 's an 18 - year - old international pop sensation who stands at an imposing 5 feet 7 inches and probably weighs about 135 pounds			1
but on sunday , @entity1 was accused of channeling his inner @entity15 , lashing out at a member of the paparazzi who was trying to snap some photos of him and his famous girlfriend , @entity20 , as the two exited a movie theater			1
to me , however , the real issue is not this incident			1
i predict this matter will be quickly resolved , possibly with a transfer of funds to the photographer 's bank account			2
the issue that truly needs to addressed is this the paparazzi 's daily pursuit of celebrities as if they were contestants in " @entity35			1
" they stake out hotels , restaurants , schools , homes , trying to snap a photo of a celebrity or their families			2
the obvious reason is that the photographers sell these photos , and often for big bucks			0
but why should these photographers be allowed to profit off the images of celebrities without the celebrities ' consent ? if a corporation wants to use an image of celebrities in an advertising campaign , they must first obtain their approval and typically pay them a fee			1
this is because our copyright laws provide that if you take a photo , you own the copyright to that picture			2
consequently , members of the paparazzi who snap a photo , even over the objections of the person , are awarded the full bundle of rights afforded by the federal copyright laws , including the right to sell the photo for a profit			1
our nation 's copyright laws were enacted to protect original works			0
one of the goals of the law is to foster creativity , so people will invest the skill and effort needed to create works to which they will own exclusive rights , such as books , paintings , music and movies			2
no one can argue that people who snap a photo of @entity95 as he exits a @entity98 eating strawberry frozen yogurt or , worse , hang around outside grammar schools taking photos of someone 's children deserve the same legal protection as those who create a movie , music or other work of art. our laws should be revised so that the copyright owner would no longer be the photographer who took the photo			2
instead , the owner should be the person whose appearance in the photo makes it valuable : the celebrity			0
let 's be honest , media outlets are n't buying these photos from the paparazzi because of the photographer 's great talent for lighting			1
it 's because the photo contains an image of a celebrity			0
why should n't the person giving the image its value own the rights to it ? indeed , our legal system has long recognized that we all have a " right of publicity , " which means that we each have the right to control the use of our name , image and likeness			0
and obviously , this is a bigger issue for well - known people because their images yield a monetary value			1
to me , the unauthorized taking of person 's photo and selling it for profit is akin to stealing a valuable asset from that person			2
this statutory revision would remove the financial incentive for the paparazzi to stalk celebrities , because the photos could not be sold or distributed to any third party without the celebrities ' consent , with exceptions for occasions that are newsworthy , such as a court appearance or arrest			1
but walking down the street , going to the gym or taking your children to school should be off - limits			0
the definition of " celebrity " and what constitutes a legitimate photograph would be defined by statute and the court decisions interpreting the law			0
although this would create a different legal standard for celebrities versus private citizens , our legal system makes a similar distinction in defamation cases , holding public figures to a higher standard of proof than the average person			0
i know some people have zero sympathy for stars			0
true , they have chosen this life , and there are certain consequences that accompany fame			0
and some have achieved fame with the least talent possible : i 'm looking at you , cast of " the @entity200			0
" but why should a talented singer , musician or actor be sentenced to a life with no privacy simply because of their success ? should n't we all have the right to a quiet meal with our family or the chance to walk our children to school without having cameras jammed into our kids ' faces ? this does n't put the paparazzi out of business			0
there will still be plenty of work taking photos of famous people who consent			0
celebrities still need to be in the media and so do their projects			0
it will mean only that in normal day - to - day situations , celebrities will be able to retain a shred of privacy and no longer have to worry about paparazzi chasing them as they go food shopping or trying to enjoy " date night , " as in the case of the " mighty " @entity1			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity242 .			1

@entity1 *allegedly* lashed out at a photographer trying to get pics of him and girlfriend
@entity242 says the issue is whether paparazzi should stalk celebs and their families
he asks : why should paparazzi profit off images of celebrities without their consent ?
law should provide that celebs must give consent , with exceptions for news , he *writes*
