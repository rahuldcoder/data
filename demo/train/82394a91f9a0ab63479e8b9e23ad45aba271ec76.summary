@entity0 -- president @entity2 and secretary of state @entity3 pledged to end violence and discrimination against gays and lesbians at home and abroad tuesday , as the @entity2 administration moves to extend further benefits to gays working in the federal government			1
" it 's not right , it 's not who we are as @entity20 , and we 're going to put a stop to it , " @entity2 told a raucous @entity14 reception honoring @entity15			1
earlier , @entity23 received several standing ovations from a standing - room only crowd of several hundred during her address at an event co-hosted by the @entity30 's @entity29 and @entity31 , the organization for @entity33 in @entity34			2
" we are moving together in the right direction , " said @entity23			2
" we reaffirm our commitment to protect the rights of all human beings			0
" the @entity14 event invited politicians and government officials as well as lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender @entity20 from across the country , including young people " who have stood up for equality , " said @entity14 spokesman @entity49			1
at a similar event last year , six months after @entity2 took office , participants expressed frustration over what they called a lack of progress in confronting discrimination issues that the president had promised to resolve			1
this time , @entity2 received loud applause , cheers and whistles as he cited steps his administration has taken , including a new hate crimes law , extending federal benefits to gay employees and a push for an employee discrimination bill			1
the @entity2 administration is expected to announce wednesday that gay workers will be able to take medical leave to care for the sick or newborn children of their same - sex partners as part of the @entity74 , which generally allows those working for companies with 50 or more employees to take 12 unpaid weeks off to care for newborns or children with serious health issues			1
" and finally , we 're going to end " do n't ask , do n't tell , " @entity2 said tuesday of the policy that prohibits openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service			1
a bill that would repeal the policy after a @entity87 review is completed in december is before @entity88 , the president noted			0
" we have never been closer to ending this discriminatory policy , and i 'm going to keep on fighting until that bill is on my desk , " he said to cheers			0
attending the event was @entity94 of @entity95 , @entity0 , who was denied hospital visitation rights when her partner of 18 years , @entity97 , was stricken with a fatal brain aneurysm while on vacation in @entity100			0
@entity2 mentioned her story on tuesday , calling the way she was treated " wrong " and " cruel			0
" earlier , @entity23 said she is asking embassies in @entity104 and elsewhere to report on rights of the local lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender communities			1
the @entity30 also is placing more attention on ensuring gays around the world have access to hiv / aids prevention and treatment , and providing grants to human rights activists who are persecuted either because they are gay or defend gay rights , she said			1
" these dangers are not gay issues			0
this is a human rights issue , " @entity23 said			2
she drew more rousing applause when she declared " human rights are gay rights and gay rights are human rights , " a variation on the phrase she famously delivered in @entity128 10 years ago declaring " women 's rights are human rights			0
" @entity23 said she is equally concerned about creating an environment at the @entity30 in which gay employees feel valued and " can give 100 percent			2
" that is why , she said , she supported offering equal benefits to same - sex partners of @entity30 employees , a move that encouraged @entity2 to authorize such benefits for gays throughout the federal government			2
she noted the @entity30 also has made it easier for transgender people to change their passports and , for the first time , the agency 's " equal opportunity statement " will include gender identity			0
it already includes sexual orientation			0
