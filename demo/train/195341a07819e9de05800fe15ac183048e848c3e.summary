-- from the forests of @entity4 to the shore of the @entity6 , in the coming months @entity2 's frontiers will be exploring the rich diversity of life on our planet and the challenges of conservation			0
how can development and the needs of growing populations be balanced against preserving the @entity2 's richest and most fragile ecosystems ? it 's a problem that the world 's biodiversity hotspots are facing , and at stake is the very existence of thousands of species of plants and animals			1
the world 's 34 recognized biodiversity hotspots only cover 2.3 percent of the @entity2 's land surface , and have declined by 70 percent from their original vegetation coverage			1
but despite the decreasing size of these hotspots they are still home to 50 percent of the world 's plant species			2
join @entity2 's frontiers later this month as we examine the battle between progress and preservation and what can be learnt , through biomimicry , from nature 's design .			0
