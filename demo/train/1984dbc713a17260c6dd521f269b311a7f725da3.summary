-- lectures , slide shows and notes are often boring , but people are using technology to find entertainment in these unlikely places			1
spoof notes of " @entity9 " are scribbled into a fun online " pencast			1
" some use high - tech pens to track presentations			1
others share powerpoints in slide show form online			1
these technologically spiced - up presentations seem to be getting more attention these days			1
they 're also creating buzz about what the future of presentations might hold			1
consider " pencasts , " which are made using the @entity26 and specially gridded paper , both sold by the @entity29 startup @entity26			0
the pen writes like an ordinary pen but also has a voice recorder , and it " notes " ( so to speak ) which notes were taken at which point in the recording			1
some quirky @entity26 presentations come off as comedy sketches			2
one popular presentation muses about how @entity40 might have come up with the idea for @entity9			2
some university students love the technology because they can record and play back what their professor was saying at an exact point in their notes -- which is especially useful when you ca n't read your own writing			1
and many professors are all for it , too			0
" i feel like this is one of those ' @entity57 ' moments in which a new technology comes into our lives with enormous potential and we just do n't know what to do with it yet , " blogs @entity64 , a cultural anthropology and digital ethnography professor at @entity67			2
" we think of it in terms of what we know ( pen and paper ) and fail to recognize the potential			0
" that potential -- for entertainment and serious uses alike -- can be gleaned from pencasts posted on the @entity26 web site 's community section , which is about a year old			0
the pencasts posted there have collectively received more than 1.5 million views			0
soon , it will be easier to embed pencasts on other sites , like personal blogs , the company says			0
slide shows are further along in popularity			1
a startup called @entity88 launched in late 2006 with the idea of allowing people to easily share their powerpoint presentations			2
its site had more than 15 million visitors last month , and its 2008 contest for the best presentations showed off the form 's potential			2
the best are far removed from the dull bullet - point presentations you might have fallen asleep to			1
many use dramatic images , striking design and memorable phrases			0
former vice president @entity103 developed his presentation on the planet 's environmental challenges into the @entity108 - winning documentary and best - selling book " @entity110			0
" last year 's top @entity88 presentation , called " thirst , " highlights the looming water crisis and has nearly 200,000 views			0
others are more light - hearted			0
the no. 2 spot ( with more than 60,000 views ) went to a presentation called " @entity118			0
" it shows pictures of the narrator 's feet in various places she 's been ( like on cobblestone corridors in @entity125 and a dance floor in @entity127 ) , interspersed with inspiring quotes related to feet and walking			2
finally , for many people , the most dreaded , boring form of communication of all is the lecture			0
but then , how to explain the popularity of the @entity138 videos ? @entity138 stands for @entity138			1
the conference started in the mid- ' 80s and has become a networking event of sorts for the world 's best and brightest			0
dozens of speakers give presentations of about 20 minutes each -- the perfect duration for a juicy " media snack			2
" @entity138 started introducing @entity138 to the public for free in july 2006 , and by the following year , there were more than a hundred talks dating back to 2002			1
broken down into dozens of themes , today they 're popular fodder for video ipods			2
in one , the amputee athlete and model @entity155 talks about how her many pairs of artificial legs often beat having a single pair of regular ones -- some make her taller , others are works of art. in another , @entity166 , an astronomer and director of the @entity168 , discusses how insanely large the universe is and what a " waste of space " it would be if life on @entity173 were indeed all there is			0
it 's hard to watch a handful of @entity138 videos and not feel your perspective broadening			1
that helps explain how , despite the lecture format , @entity138 has become hugely popular			1
a few months ago , the videos surpassed the 100 million views mark -- not bad for a bunch of lectures .			0
