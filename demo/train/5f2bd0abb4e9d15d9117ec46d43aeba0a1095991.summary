the revelations thursday over the identity of " @entity2 " -- that he apparently grew up and was educated in @entity4 , and that he has a degree in computing from @entity7 in @entity8 -- have left us with some profoundly troubling issues			1
it appears clear that security authorities have known for some time who he is , but kept this fact hidden , either , one assumes , because they were attempting to capture him or because they were trying to protect his family from vigilantes			1
whatever the reason , the fact that he had the benefit of higher education ( and had picked up state of the art it skills ) once again highlights how our education system fails to protect either us , the citizens of a free country , or the students themselves from the violent horrors of @entity33			1
meanwhile , the fact that many @entity4 universities this month stated they will continue to resist the proposals made by the government in the latest counterterrorism legislation ( including imposing on them a duty to keep extremists off their campuses and notify the authorities if they believe their students have been brainwashed by them ) is nothing short of a total national disgrace			1
but the news surrounding @entity48 , identified by the @entity49 as a @entity50 - born @entity8 , raises a few other points worth noting			1
first of all , by giving him a name , we give his victims ' loved ones the hope that he may be captured or brought to trial at some future date			2
the release of his name could also deter him from further acts of unspeakable sadism , or perhaps make some of his comrades with the @entity69 and @entity70 rethink some of their plans			2
and it might even prompt some young @entity73 to think twice about going out to live and die for @entity74			1
this case also makes it clear that the time has now come for a new @entity79 declaration or @entity80 to the effect that these @entity33 war criminals will be hunted down , and that retribution for their crimes will be sought , just as we pursued the @entity87 war criminals at @entity88 and elsewhere			2
comprehensive lists of @entity74 members should be drawn up as a matter of urgency			1
in addition , the time has come to review what can be done to stop young @entity97 men and women from joining the ranks of the jihadis			2
education has a part to play , but it is plain that whatever has been done so far has not been adequate			0
new , more proactive measures may be required			0
at the same time , it is also self - evident that education alone is not enough			0
instead , we also need effective intelligence - led security policies that must include letting our intelligence agencies access electronic data in their search of jihadi recruitment campaigns			0
this is the only way we have to protect everyone			0
we know , thanks to @entity117 and his friends , that our ability to monitor and disrupt jihadists has declined by perhaps a third			0
obviously , they continue to communicate , but either they are doing so in ways we find increasingly hard to track , or our security agencies are so fearful of being tarred as " snoopers " that they have become far too cautious about investigating those who want to do us grave harm			0
finally , it must surely be clear to @entity133 leaders that as long as president @entity134 refuses to dismantle @entity74 as a political entity in the only way possible -- by putting boots on the ground -- @entity33 will continue to present us in the @entity139 with a monumental threat			1
sadly , it is one which will grow , fueled as it is by those we have educated with great care and to whom we have taught some of our most useful skills .			0
