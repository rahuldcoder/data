@entity0 -- @entity3 presidential candidate @entity2 said it was " heartbreaking " that the deaths of women killed by a convicted rapist who was released from prison after @entity2 supported his parole had become politicized			1
@entity2 denies pressuring the @entity10 to release @entity11			1
on wednesday , the mother of the woman the convict later murdered pledged to campaign against the former @entity16 governor			1
" there are families who are truly , understandably and reasonably , grief stricken , " @entity2 told @entity1			2
" and for people to now politicize these deaths and to try to make a political case out of it rather than to simply understand that a system failed and that we ought to extend our grief and heartfelt sorrow to these families , i just regret politics is reduced to that			0
" the case of the rapist , @entity11 , began in 1985 , when he was accused of raping a 17 - year - old girl			0
he was later convicted and sentenced to a life term			0
before trial , @entity11 was attacked in his home and castrated , and the local sheriff kept the severed testicles in a jar			0
no charges were brought in the attack			0
in 1996 , @entity2 , during his first term as @entity16 governor , expressed support for the parole of @entity11 in a letter to him			1
the @entity16 parole board , which has the final say on such matter , later approved @entity11 's parole			1
@entity54 deny he pressured the board to approve @entity11 's parole Â» less than a year after his release from prison in 1999 , @entity11 was accused of raping and murdering @entity59 , a woman in @entity60 , @entity61			1
@entity11 was convicted of the crime in 2003			0
he died in prison in 2005			0
@entity2 on sunday confirmed to @entity1 he had sent the letter to @entity11			2
the murdered woman 's mother , @entity65 , said she will " absolutely campaign against " @entity2 , and said she decided to come forward when he started doing well in the polls			1
" it 's because he is a serious contender , " @entity68 said			0
" i did n't think he had a chance , but now he 's right up there in @entity74			0
" @entity2 said he had considered granting @entity76 clemency in 1996 , but he dropped the idea in response to public outcry and because he wanted to ensure @entity11 was supervised when he was released from prison			1
" had i granted his commutation , then there would have been no supervision at all , " @entity2 said , " i was n't comfortable with that			2
" when he spoke about the case , @entity2 suggested his role in the decision to parole @entity11 was limited			1
@entity2 said it was the decision by former @entity89			2
@entity90 and @entity91 that made @entity11 eligible for parole , and @entity2 declined to reduce @entity11 's sentence further			1
" i 've never made a decision about the @entity11 case other than the decision to write the letter " to @entity11 , @entity2 said			2
" that was my decision , but i did n't parole him , because governors do n't parole people in @entity16			2
" however , @entity103 , a parole board member at the time , told @entity105 he felt pressure from @entity2 when the board considered @entity11 's parole in 1996 , and the @entity109 reported in 2002 that two other board members said they were influenced by @entity2 to parole @entity111			1
@entity2 denied he asked the board to approve @entity11 's parole			1
" no , i did not , " @entity2 said sunday			0
" let me categorically say i did not			0
" @entity2 noted that the three board members who said they were pressured were appointed to the board by @entity115 and @entity91			2
@entity2 said wednesday his discussion with the parole board in 1996 was a general discussion about clemency , not about the @entity11 case			1
but a former @entity2 aide , @entity121 , tells @entity1 that the @entity11 case was discussed during the meeting with the parole board , but that it was the board members who asked @entity2 about the case			1
@entity121 said @entity2 did not pressure the board to approve @entity11 's parole			1
documents posted on the web site @entity129 indicate @entity2 received letters from several victims of @entity11 before his release			0
the letters detailed his past actions and pleaded that he remain incarcerated			0
" i feel that if he is released it is only a matter of time before he commits another crime and fear that he will not leave a witness to testify against him the next time , " one victim wrote			0
she described how @entity11 had raped her at knifepoint			0
a former top @entity2 aide confirmed to @entity1 that the then - governor received that letter and a follow - up phone call from the victim			2
