@entity0 , @entity1 -- it has been nearly a week since a truce between the @entity1 government and rebel groups took effect in @entity0 , and as opposition fighters have left the @entity11 area of the city , thousands of displaced residents have come back			1
the streets of the district are packed with people carrying belongings out of the district or moving possessions in to return to their homes			2
the people are usually busy and rarely joke or smile , but in the middle of this scene there was a tiny , thin and frail - looking woman who stood out			2
her name is @entity27 and a group of people had gathered around her , hugging and kissing her , almost crying with joy			1
@entity27 is one of fewer than 30 civilians known to have lived through the entire siege of @entity0 -- more than two years of constant shelling , sniper fire and starvation			1
" i am 49 years old and i weigh only 34 kilos ( about 75 pounds ) , " @entity27 told me when i met her at a damaged church in @entity38			1
" the shelling was terrible , it was going on almost all the time			1
i got wounded on my arm and my shoulder once			0
" @entity27 survived the siege with her brother @entity45			1
they remained in a little apartment , hoping it would n't be flattened by an artillery shell , or that @entity51 rebels would not kill the two @entity52 , as @entity52 are often perceived by the opposition to support the regime of president @entity55			0
" they often accused me of supporting the government , " @entity56 said , sitting in the apartment with his sister @entity27			1
" i told them -- who am i supposed to support when i am stuck in here ? i am not supporting anyone			0
" @entity45 and @entity27 devoted all of their energy to staying alive			1
@entity45 ventured out into the dangerous streets almost every day , looking for material to burn in the little stove they have in the apartment			0
" i only got the wood that the rebels left behind after they cut down the trees			1
i also never burned any furniture , all i used were broken window frames and doors after they were blown out by the shelling			2
" the windows in the little apartment the brother and sister occupied were quickly blown out as well , leaving them cold on top of being hungry and scared of the war that was being fought around them			1
rebels captured the old town of @entity0 in 2011			1
the @entity1 military later started a massive push to win the territory back using heavy weapons including artillery in the urban area			1
then government forces encircled the rebels and laid siege to the district , preventing food and medical supplies from getting in			0
the @entity102 accuses the @entity55 regime of using starvation as a weapon in the civil war			0
the @entity107 says both sides are guilty of keeping supplies from reaching besieged places , but that the government 's use of starvation is more widespread			0
@entity27 and @entity45 soon found their supplies running out as the siege raged on			1
" in the beginning we had some canned foods , but those quickly ran out , " @entity45 said			0
" then the rebels came and raided our apartment			0
they took a lot of the dry foods we had left like flour , bulgur and rice			2
they came more than 30 times and broke in and held guns to our face			0
it is an awful feeling to be sleeping at night and then to wake up with a gun to your head			0
" when the last of the food was gone , @entity45 was forced to go out and search for grass and leaves to eat			2
he found the leaves that saved their lives on a tree in a graveyard , of all places			1
" they taste the best			0
the other ones were very bitter , " he said			0
" we ate them for breakfast , dinner and for lunch every day			2
" @entity27 showed me a tiny bowl , which was the serving size they allowed themselves for each meal			1
" we cut them up and made a stew with them for lunch , " she said			0
" in the mornings we would eat them fresh with some oil we had left , and in the evenings we tried to fry them on the stove if we had wood			2
these leaves saved our lives			2
" the brother and sister say it was also their faith that helped them through the two years of confinement , violence and hunger			1
" there were some nights that we were just sad , " @entity45 said			0
" when you just think that you have not seen your family in such a long time , that you might never see them again and that you have no idea when you will be able to get out of here			2
in those times , sometimes we just cried			2
" but in the end they made it through more than 700 days of the siege of @entity38			0
@entity27 is still weak and can not stand for an extended period of time			1
she spends most of the time on the couch in the apartment reading books or resting			0
@entity45 is stronger , but his clothes look baggy on him after he lost so much weight due to the starvation			0
but both @entity45 and @entity27 are survivors			1
they say the hardship they have endured might have made them thin and frail , but it has made their spirits stronger than ever , and they are looking to the future with optimism .			0

as a truce in @entity0 holds , life comes back to the @entity11 area
but for a brother and sister , life never left despite two years of shelling and *scarcity*
@entity27 and @entity56 ate leaves from trees in a graveyard to stay alive
" you have no idea when you will be able to get out *...* sometimes we just cried "
