@entity1 , @entity0 -- before the late 1960s @entity3 was a quite different sport			2
the first thing that a casual observer would notice -- looking at pictures from this era -- is that the cars were void of any sponsorship			1
semiconductor makers @entity12 and @entity13 slug it out on the racetrack and in the market place racing legends @entity18 , @entity19 and their contemporaries would lap the circuits of the @entity22 without branded baseball hats and overalls , without any stickers on their cars or without having to attend events to keep their sponsors happy			2
towards the end of the 1960s , engine manufacturers began to realize the potential of advertising on their cars , and started to increase the size of their own logos			0
it was n't until 1968 that the first corporate sponsor made it onto a formula 1 car , when the championship - winning @entity41 team introduced the logo of @entity46 's @entity45 brand on the side of their cars			0
thereafter , @entity3 and sponsorship became inseparable			1
while the drivers and the teams would still continue to battle it out on the track , @entity3 has become as much about the business as about the racing			1
today , the combined budget of all 11 teams is said to be in excess of $ 2.5 billion and the largest portion of this money is provided for by sponsors			1
repeated market research has revealed that consumers consider @entity3 1 " sophisticated , dynamic and prestigious "			0
some of the larger sponsors commit hundreds of millions , over several years , to associate their brands with these appealing characteristics			0
the question remains , what exactly sponsors receive in return for investing such large sums			0
obviously , the larger sponsors will receive a good size logo on a visible spot of the car or even become title sponsors such as @entity74 with @entity75 or @entity76 with @entity77			0
good television coverage has the potential to create outstanding results as the sport is watched by between five and seven billion people every year , providing work for an army of 10000 accredited journalists			1
in 2005 , the total advertising value of @entity3 has been estimated at $ 5.2 billion or $ 0.74 per viewer			1
but what are the benefits apart from that fleeting glimpse of a logo when the car roars past the grandstands at 250 mph ? clearly sponsorship is about more than visibility of a logo			1
modern sponsorship contracts in @entity3 are tailored to the needs of both the sponsor and the team			2
this often includes activities and promotions outside of the @entity3 calendar			0
@entity105 , marketing manager for financial and news wire service @entity106 , a sponsor of the @entity77 explains : " our sponsorship contract with @entity77 allows us access to the team 's drivers to help promote our brand and our business			1
" indeed , @entity77 drivers have played a part in promoting @entity106 products over the past few years			2
we also have the rights to use @entity77 imagery to enhance our marketing communications materials and customer events			0
" sponsoring a @entity3 team also gives a company the possibility to tap into a vast network of potential customers among its fellow sponsors , as the sport has already attracted some very strong brands from various different sectors			0
rival semiconductor manufacturers @entity12 and @entity13 sponsor @entity132 and @entity133 respectively			0
and other sponsors include drinks conglomerates @entity135 and @entity137 , and telecommunications giants @entity139 and @entity76			0
this gives an unrivalled networking opportunity for blue chip companies			1
where else but at @entity146 can senior executives of consumer electronics giants casually rub shoulders with hedge fund managers and the bosses of it firms ? this opportunity to network and exchange business ideas is a benefit of sponsoring a @entity3 team not to be overlooked @entity106 ' contract with the @entity77 team has delivered just that , says @entity158 : " the team boasts the strongest stable of global business brands as sponsors , some of which are also our key customers or business partners -- for example @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			1
" the @entity170 plays host to many senior executives from these companies over the course of a season and this can provide a platform for valuable business discussions or introductions			1
" for the drivers this means that apart from having to deliver during the race , they also have to attend corporate events of their sponsors and appear in their adverts			2
hence we see @entity187 and @entity188 looking implausibly chummy in commercials for @entity191 bank @entity190			0
while seen as distracting by some , it is something the top drivers can not afford to do without			2
without sponsorship revenue a driver is worthless to his team , as @entity199 found to his cost when he failed to bring in the promised sponsorship to @entity202			2
@entity18 and @entity19 competed in an era without commercial exposure -- and without anything like the financial reward			0
thanks to sponsorship deals today 's drivers like @entity209 and @entity187 reap the benefits of their commercial exposure in the form of much higher salaries			1

*majority* of teams ' $ 2.5 billion budget generated from sponsorship
@entity170 is a unique networking opportunity for senior executives
drivers reap the benefit of increased sponsorship in the form of higher salaries
