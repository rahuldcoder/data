whether it 's learning how to read and write or setting up your own farm , a @entity4 computer tablet -- known as the @entity5 -- is trying to open up the country 's information highway			1
the brain child of @entity10 tech entrepreneur @entity9 , the @entity5 principally teaches users basic numeracy and literacy skills , aimed at primary school children			1
" it became clear that there was a huge need for this kind of technology , " @entity9 said , " particularly tablet technology , which has come a long way in @entity22 in recent years			1
" after arriving in @entity4 30 years ago under the @entity23 , @entity9 worked in the computer department at the country 's national university for over a decade before deciding to go it alone			1
" we can really do something very major for the first time , " he said			2
" we 've invested about $ 5 million to date ... it 's totally all - encompassing and quite prescriptive so we are aiming at being able to get to an untrained teacher in a deep rural area in the @entity22 bush			2
" interactive learning the @entity5 is programmed in eight different languages native to @entity4 with over 12,000 preloaded classes and lesson plans for untrained teachers in rural areas , according to @entity9			1
approved by the @entity4 @entity42 , the educational tablet allows children to create a personal profile on its seven - inch screen to keep track of their progress as well as exposing them to e-mail and @entity49			1
@entity9 said the @entity5 is set up to teach grades one to seven through interactive learning in every subject from math to @entity54 , art and music			1
the technology comes at a time when @entity4 's educational system is undergoing sweeping changes			2
since 2001 , the government has increased primary school enrollment rates by 90 %			0
as a result , the @entity63 has identified the landlocked southern @entity22 nation as having one of the most improved primary school education systems in the developing world			0
@entity9 added : " for years there was a problem with funding , education was not keeping up with population growth			2
young people coming out of school and not being well suited or prepared to enter the job market ...			0
we 're trying to change that			0
" the @entity5 gives children a grasp of vital technology skills in a landlocked country where broadband is scarce and only 18 % of the nation 's 14 million people have access to electricity , according to the @entity63			1
in addition to following the national curriculum , the tablet also contains farming and health information designed for adults to help prevent the spread of killer diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria			2
outsourcing to @entity98 the @entity99 is currently manufactured , assembled and branded in @entity98			0
the devices are then loaded onto a plane and transported to @entity4 , where @entity9 and his team install the software onto each tablet			1
" it costs roughly $ 100 to have them made and landed here in this country , " @entity9 said			2
" we sell them to teachers and schools for $ 200 at the moment			0
we hope to bring that price down			0
one of the other things we 're trying to do is provide significant tech support			0
" after teachers purchase the @entity5 , @entity9 said his team of experts go into schools and provide tutorials for staff so that they can maximize the tablets ' functions while learning how to deliver lessons to pupils			1
@entity9 said the tablet has , at one time or another , helped employ over 250 staff working in the development and distribution of the software from the company 's base in the @entity4 capital , @entity137			1
he says he has approached the government over hiring assembly workers in @entity4 but to no avail			0
he said that at a time when few companies are manufacturing technology outside of the @entity145 , production in @entity98 is " the cheapest and most cost - effective thing to do			0
" ' huge change ' looking ahead , @entity9 does n't want to stop at @entity4 but hopes to roll the educational tablet out to a raft of other nations on the continent			1
he believes that as countries in the developed world continue to transition from desktop computers to smart devices , @entity22 has a real chance to leapfrog ahead			0
" i think the next big challenge is going to come from a lot of people who have got very cheap mobile phones			0
we 'll gradually see @entity163 smartphones coming out for $ 70 or so ... huge change is happening at the moment , " @entity9 said			2
