-- early data shows the @entity5 rover @entity4 landed with amazing accuracy this week , coming down about 1.5 miles from its target after a 350 - million - mile journey , @entity2 scientists said friday , perhaps giving planners more confidence about landing spacecraft in tight spaces in the future			1
the $ 2.6 billion rover is on a two - year mission to determine whether @entity5 ever had an environment capable of supporting life			0
it landed monday and will spend the next four days installing operational software that will give it full movement and analytic capabilities , scientists said at a news conference at @entity2 's @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26			1
@entity4 missed its target entry point into @entity5 ' atmosphere by about only one mile , and most everything in its complicated descent and landing operations -- a spectacle popularly known as the " seven minutes of terror " -- happened on time , including the deployment of the largest - ever supersonic parachute and the heat shield separation			1
" from all the data we 've received so far , we flew this right down the middle , and it 's incredible to work on a plan for ( years ) and then have things happen ... according to plan , " said @entity37 , who was involved in the powered descent phase			0
" it was an impressive ride , " said @entity2 's @entity47 , the operations lead for descent and landing			1
tail winds might account for some of the off - target distance , @entity2 's @entity52 said , but the actual landing spot was well within the expected range of uncertainty , or the area where the rover could well have ended up			1
" with what we learn over the next few months , we 'll see if we can chop ( the area of uncertainty ) back a bit " for future missions , @entity47 said			1
@entity47 said the early information about the landing is based on only 1 megabyte of data received on the day of the landing ; much more information will be received in the coming weeks			1
precision in landing was important because @entity2 chose a relatively tight area for @entity4 's arrival : the @entity75 , which contains an 18,000 - foot high mountain about 7.5 miles south of the landing site			1
the rover 's prime target is @entity80 , the mountain in the crater			0
scientists hope the layers of rock that form the mountain will give them a timeline of the history of @entity5			0
though @entity4 's primary science mission has yet to begin , the rover , along with probes in orbit , already have transmitted images			0
on thursday , @entity2 released a sweeping color panorama of the planet 's surface , showing the rocky , reddish desert surrounding it and the mountain it will explore in the coming months			2
the 360 - degree view captures the landscape of @entity75			0
@entity2 has said photographs like the ones beamed back by the rover , as well as others taken by the probes in orbit , will be used to map a path to the mountain 's base			2
the rover is built to run for two years , but a previous rover , @entity110 , has been working on @entity5 since 2004 , well beyond the three months @entity2 planned			0
opportunity 's sister rover , @entity111 , ran from 2004 to 2010			0
the rover is installing its full surface operations software after the landing because its computers did n't have room for it during flight			2
the new software essentially replaces the flight operations programs , which @entity4 now does n't need , @entity2 said			2
complete coverage of @entity5 @entity0 's @entity123 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 *analyzing* early entry , landing data to help with future missions
*curiosity* landed very near target site , important for relatively tight space
" it was an impressive ride , " said @entity2 's @entity47
@entity136 will take days to install software for full movement , analytic capabilities
