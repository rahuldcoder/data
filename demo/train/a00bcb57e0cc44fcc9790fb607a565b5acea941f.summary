-- after a setback from the natural and nuclear disasters of 2011 , tourism has rebounded in @entity4			1
the @entity5 reports a 21 % increase in visitor arrival numbers between january and august 2013 compared with the same period last year			2
the renewed surge of visitors is being partly attributed to @entity4 's successful bid for the @entity11 and prime minister @entity13 's efforts to bulk up the economy			1
@entity16 is the classic time to visit the city			2
the oppressive humidity of summer has cleared , autumn colors bring life to @entity4 's many parks , hearty , seasonal foods are the order of the day and the fresh fashion the country is known for is celebrated on the streets			1

tip no. 1 : do n't tip attentive service is the norm in @entity36 , part of a cultural dedication to hospitality called omotenashi			2
tipping is n't expected in taxis , at hair salons , for doormen or bartenders			1
not only are gratuities not expected , they wo n't be accepted			1
some restaurant checks will include a service charge			2
if you leave money behind , no matter how much or little , do n't be surprised if your server chases you down the street to return it			2

walk right -- on the left with 35 million people , greater @entity4 is one of the most densely populated urban centers in the world			1
everyone waits until the light changes to cross the street			2
pedestrians on wide sidewalks follow the unspoken rule of staying to the left almost as strictly as cars ( also on the left ) do			2
exception : on @entity4 escalators , stand on the left and walk on the right			1
( around @entity79 , escalator etiquette is reversed			2
drink outside , smoke inside the more enclosed a space is , the more likely you 'll be allowed to smoke there			2
the smaller and homier a bar or restaurant , the more likely it is to be smoker - friendly			2
many bullet trains still have smoking cars			1
on the other hand , smoking is prohibited on many sidewalks ( look for signs stenciled on the sidewalk ) , except around public ashtrays			1
street patrols stop people who engage in aruki - tabako , or " walking - smoking			2
" cracking open a beer or can of fruity , boozy chu - hai on the walk or train home , however , is a cherished tradition			2
more : 5 @entity4 bars for train nerds ( yes , they exist ) 4			1
one card is good for all trains and buses the @entity4 train system is actually a network of three train companies			1
originally , each system required its own tickets			2
now rechargeable @entity115 and @entity116 cards let riders seamlessly touch their way in and out of all lines			2
as of march 2013 , paying fares got even easier -- a single card became usable for trains and buses throughout the country			1
you can get one as soon as you arrive in @entity4 from almost any ticket machine			1
the ¥ 500 deposit ( a little over $ 5 ) for the card is refundable			1
the time you save not calculating ticket costs makes it worthwhile even if you keep the card as a souvenir			1
there are pockets of quiet everywhere from temples hidden between office buildings ( @entity138 in @entity139 is a favorite of these ) to the tree - lined canal that runs the length of @entity144 , you 're never far from an oasis of calm in the frantic city			0
winding residential streets lined with walled gardens are often just a block away from busy main roads			0
if you take a detour down a little unmarked road ( most @entity36 streets are unnamed ) chances are you 'll discover a tiny cafe , quirky neighborhood art project or a jumble of ultramodern condos and rickety ancient architecture			0

@entity36 bathhouses public bathhouses , or sento , are a soothing holdover from a time when most homes did n't have bathtubs			1
whether it 's a bright , modern place in @entity174 with fizzy water and fancy soap or a creaky neighborhood bath with a coin - operated hairdryer that 's been bolted to the floor since the 1960s , all public baths cost ¥ 450			1
the @entity181 is redoubling efforts to make them foreigner friendly ahead of the @entity183 by posting etiquette and instruction cards in four languages			1
that word you keep hearing is ' welcome ' after a few days in @entity4 , you might find yourself asking , " what 's that thing they always say when i walk in ? " whether it 's sweaty , aproned guys shouting in unison as you walk into an izakaya ( lively restaurants that serve alcohol with lots of small dishes ) or one perfectly coiffed woman murmuring as you enter the hush of a small boutique , they 're saying the same thing : " @entity207			1
" it 's a polite way of saying " welcome			0
" although your instinct may be to reply -- " thank you ? " " hello ? " -- locals insist no response is required			0
a friendly little bow in response does n't hurt , though			0
the sushi really is that good the famous tuna auction at @entity217 starts just after 5 a.m. , but the day 's 120 free tickets are often all snapped up as early as 4			0
whether you get to the auction or not , the market and surrounding shops will be springing to life around that time -- it 's the best place to enjoy an early morning plate of the freshest sushi you 've ever tasted			0
you need not be there that early , but many of the hundreds of shops start to close by 1 p.m. visit and you , too , will be one of those insufferable diners who ca n't eat sushi back home without saying , " it 's good , but it 's nothing like the maguro i had in @entity36			0
" but hurry -- the legendary market is set to close at the end of 2013			0
a new facility will open a few kilometers away in 2014			0

even places like @entity254 that have relatively accessible free @entity244 require you to create an account in advance			1

@entity263 turns up everywhere @entity36 has a long tradition of @entity266 vegetarian cuisine called shojin ryori			0
it is painstakingly prepared and served on fine lacquerware and ceramics			0
it 's worth experiencing ( @entity272 - starred @entity271 is outstanding ) and guaranteed to be vegetarian , but it 's expensive and a time - consuming affair			0
for a quick veggie meal , you usually have to be vigilant			0
a " vegetable sandwich " may have a sneaky slice of ham in it , and pasta with " no meat " could be studded with chunks of bacon			0
" meat " tends to mean " beef			0
" running down a list of every animal product that you 'd like to avoid is the only way to be sure			0
and your potato salad might still come with bacon			0
@entity294 umbrellas are the best umbrellas into every vacation a little rain must fall			0
if you 're in @entity36 when it does , lucky you -- it 's a perfect opportunity to pick up a clear umbrella			0
it 's such a simple innovation , you wonder why they have n't caught on elsewhere			0
once the first drops of rain hit the street , you 'll find them everywhere			0

one costs between ¥ 300 and ¥ 500			1

if yours disappears , consider it a rite of passage			0
@entity0 's @entity320 series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
