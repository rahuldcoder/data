-- it 's official : the weather has been a bit weird this winter			1
the nation 's climate agency says so -- and , in part , explains why			1
there is method to the meteorological madness			0
and it has served to spread the weirdness around the world , from the @entity13 all the way to @entity15 , a climate expert from the @entity17 said			1
the drought parching @entity19 ; those two snowpocalypses in the @entity21 ; the unrelenting @entity23 snow ; the sopping soaking of the @entity25 ; short sleeves on @entity28 's snow - hungry slopes			1
one single weather event has a hand in all of them , said @entity17 environmentalist @entity32			1
" they are associated with that long - wave pattern , so they are connected in that sense , " he said			1
that " long - wave pattern " is like a whip that got swung in @entity19 and has cracked in all the other places			1
a big , sturdy ridge of high pressure air has blustered rain clouds away from @entity19 , and at the same time , it has pushed the jet - stream way up into @entity44			1
what goes up ... in reaction to that , the jet - stream has swung back deeper into the @entity21 than usual , carrying @entity44 cold with it			0
@entity52 and ice from @entity54 to the @entity55			0
then it has whipped back up , helping big storms dump snow over the @entity59			1
from there , the same jet - stream has crossed the @entity62 and brought weather that flooded @entity64 in the wettest january there in two and a half centuries			2
down the road a bit , at the @entity67 , it 's practically springtime in @entity28 , and it 's that same jet - stream dragging in warmth that 's boosting temperatures well above freezing			1
but it gets even worse			0
the jet - stream is moving slower than in past years , which means that all that ugly weather is hovering over places for longer periods , plaguing them with more of its nastiness than usual			2
it has weather - beaten people in many parts of the world groaning the same moan : " i 've never seen weather like this before			2
" are they exaggerating ? maybe not			0
let 's have a look at the season 's weather , starting with the whip 's handle -- in @entity19 -- and follow the jet - stream 's lash from there			1
@entity99 - dehydration the dryness in @entity19 is making its mark in the history books			1
the state grows more than the lion 's share of the tomatoes used in @entity108 processed foods , farmer @entity103 brags			2
this year ? zero , he said			0
for the first time in its history , the @entity110 - a system of canals and reservoirs that provide water to two thirds of the people in the state 's @entity117 -- set its allocation for all of them to zero			1
this pertains to people in the country and in cities alike			0
@entity103 blames it in part on bureaucratic tangles between state and local authorities who decide over the water 's release			1
but that does n't negate the fact that there is a water shortage			0
his farm gets its water from reservoirs 500 miles to his north			0
this year , they are running on bare minimum			0
further down the jet - stream , there 's been precipitation to spare			2
winter blunderland if you have n't been living under a rock , you 've heard about or felt the winter ills that have walloped the nation 's @entity153			2
about two weeks ago , less than three inches of snow turned the region 's largest city into a gridlocked parking lot , where thousands of motorists sat for as much as 20 hours in their cars , while lows dipped into the teens			1
not being able to deal with snow is no surprise for a region that usually gets iced over every ten years or so -- although the last such shellacking came three years ago			1
then this week , a second winter storm polished a path of white from @entity171 all the way up to @entity173			0
not that the @entity59 is not used to snow , after all it 's winter , and it 's normal there			1
but the frequency of heavy snows has had leaders in the region huffing for a break			0
@entity182 mayor @entity181 greeted reporters covering the storm with the line : " welcome to winter storm six of the last six weeks			0
" and as @entity190 gov. @entity189 said before the worst of the storm hit : " this has just been a brutal winter where it never really has gotten warmer			0
and so the natural melting away of snow and ice is not happening			2
" exaggeration or winter storm exhaustion ? it may have been a long - planned vacation , but after the last storm passed , @entity189 took off with his family for the warmer latitudes of @entity204			0
a previous recent snow - thumping wrecked much of his inauguration celebration -- along with that bridge scandal			1
add to that increased frequency of snowfall a quick @entity0 weather factoid : over the last week , was snow on the ground in 49 of 50 states			1
oh , @entity215 following the jet - stream across the @entity62 , things get warmer , but also , much , much wetter			0
@entity218 is used to rain , but this ? the @entity221 has burst its banks			0
what @entity25 meteorologists say makes it sound like they may have already heard @entity17 's @entity226 mention of hovering , long - lasting storms			1
the @entity228 , the @entity25 's national weather service , said the recent series of winter storms " has been exceptional in its duration , and has led to the wettest december to january period in the @entity25 since records began			1
" some communities in low - lying areas in southwest @entity23 are looking more like the water - bound city of @entity238 , @entity239			0
they have been under water since december			0
and there 's no letup in sight just yet			2
authorities have warned communities along the @entity221 that more flooding is on its way , as the river reaches its highest level in 60 years			2
a powerful @entity62 storm that is blowing in on friday will add to people 's woes			2
where 's that coming from ? it 's what 's left of a storm that plastered the @entity108 with snow and ice			1
let it snow ! photos of @entity264 cross-country skiers striding for miles in the snow in short sleeves were all the rage this week			2
they illustrate how warm it has been in @entity28 , @entity15 , at the @entity67			1
low temperatures have been well above freezing , and daytime highs have hit the 50 's , @entity17 says			1
spectators may find it pleasant to walk around in light jackets -- or amusing to sit in the sun in shorts and t - shirts			2
but for the organizers , the warm weather , which @entity32 says is strongly influenced by that same jet - stream , has been no laughing matter			2
they 've had to crank up snow machines to keep some pistes white			2
@entity28 has been one of the warmest cities to host the winter games , @entity17 says on its website			1
but that 's not really shocking , the climate agency says			2
" @entity28 sits in a marginally wintry zone along the @entity295 coast near the @entity296 , " it says			1
but with the current jet - stream pattern , marginally wintry does not seem to be enough to hold back balmier air			0
luckily , many events are being held indoors or at higher , colder elevations			0
blasts of warm weather at @entity67 is nothing new , and it has been worse before			1
" in 2010 , @entity306 , @entity44 experienced its warmest january ever recorded , " @entity17 says			1
snow machines were powerless against it , so organizers had to ship in snow by truck and helicopter			0
@entity17 advises that the @entity313 should consider awarding the @entity67 to cities in solidly cold regions -- as global warming increases			1
that leads to a pertinent question that is often on people 's minds when the weather goes haywire these days			1
yes or no can we chalk this wacko winter up to climate change ? @entity32 would like to know , too			0
cracking that code will be very complicated			0
but there is something else that baffles his team			0
why has the jet - stream gotten to be so slow this year ? " that 's an area of research that we 're currently investigating			0
we do n't have a clear - cut answer to that question , " he said			0
if climate scientists can make that connection , it will allow them to better predict weather craziness as much as a month or two ahead of time , @entity32 said			0
so we 'll all know what we 've got coming			0
@entity0 's @entity342 , @entity343 and @entity344 contributed to this report .			0

*yep* , this is *unusual* ; @entity17 says so -- and , in part , why
the odd weather pattern stretches from @entity19 to @entity15
it *includes* the @entity354 's drought , the recent blasts of snow , @entity25 flooding
and it 's warming the @entity67 in @entity28
