-- a libertarian from the @entity2 and a progressive from @entity4 may not often agree on politics or what the proper role of government should be , but we agree the public has been kept in the dark on the " too big to jail " issue for too long			1
just over a year ago , many were stunned when the @entity15 decided not to indict @entity16 , headquartered in @entity17 an one of the world 's largest banks			1
the @entity15 made this decision despite the fact that the bank willfully failed to comply with anti-money laundering laws			1
@entity16 's criminal activities seemed to most observers to provide a strong case for the government			2
these activities included permitting narcotics traffickers to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of drug proceeds through @entity32 subsidiaries			0
it also facilitated hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions on behalf of customers in countries that are sanctioned by the @entity37 : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 ( formerly known as @entity42 )			0
but instead of charging @entity16 , the @entity15 entered into a deferred prosecution agreement			1
under its terms , the government agreed not to prosecute the company for its actions in exchange for @entity16 acknowledging wrongdoing , paying a fine and agreeing to cooperate with the government and remedy its compliance programs			1
the back 's ceo issued a statement accepting responsibility and saying : " the @entity16 of today is a fundamentally different organisation from the one that made those mistakes			2
" one can question the wisdom of our drug war and whether banks should be drafted into law enforcement duties , but those policy questions do not change a bank 's duty to comply with the law			2
in a @entity75 hearing after the settlement , @entity37 sen. @entity71 , @entity72 , asked attorney general @entity76 why the government chose not to indict @entity16			1
@entity76 responded by saying he was not talking about @entity16 in particular but that , " i am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute , if you do bring a criminal charge , it will have a negative impact on the national economy , perhaps even the world economy			1
" from @entity76 's statements , it appears that the government was so worried about the dangerous repercussions that could result from prosecuting such a large , complex and globally significant institution that it shielded @entity16 from criminal liability			1
in a subsequent @entity101 and @entity102 hearing that examined the " too big to jail " problem , members of @entity99 asked repeatedly how the @entity15 decides which financial institutions are " too big to jail " and what information it relies upon to make those decisions			1
the witness , acting assistant attorney general @entity109 , was evasive , and left @entity99 and the public without answers			0
now , over a year after the @entity16 settlement , those questions still loom			1
justice has yet to explain its policy and practice concerning the prosecution -- or refusal to prosecute -- large , complex financial institutions			0
without clear answers about how the @entity15 decides which financial institutions are " too big to jail " and what information it relies upon to make those decisions , we are left to wonder about the extent to which the department might be undermining its mission to enforce the law and ensure fair and impartial administration of justice			1
if it bases enforcement actions on a bank 's size and economic significance , the @entity15 would be taking on the role of financial regulator			2
while we may not agree on the wisdom of allowing bank regulators to designate certain entities as " systemic , " congressional intent is clear that such a decision is the purview not of justice but of the @entity147			0
we have yet to see any evidence that the department conferred with the @entity147 or any financial regulator in determining whether @entity16 , or any other institution , was indeed " systemic			0
" were the @entity15 to maintain a policy of basing enforcement decisions upon an entity 's perceived impact on the national economy , one result would be to further entrench " too big to fail			2
" such an arrangement would allow these favored companies to borrow at subsidized rates and to capture market - share from smaller competitors , ultimately making these same " too - big - to - fail " companies even bigger			0
" equality under the law " demands that companies are treated similarly under the law , regardless of their size			0
there can not be a separate justice system for the large and another system for the small			0
if certain institutions are being provided preferential treatment under the law , then the @entity15 should publicly acknowledge that that is the case , as well as its reasoning for doing so			2
after passing the one - year mark , we hope that our policymakers reflect on this unresolved issue and respond appropriately			0
the public deserves no less			0
