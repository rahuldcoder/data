@entity0 -- @entity2 said thursday that it will act against " hostile action " by @entity4 as troops and tanks deployed to the border after the downing of a @entity2 jet last week			1
" the incident of our unarmed plane on a test and training mission being shot down by @entity4 on june 22 , 2012 in international airspace , has been discussed in detail , " said a statement from @entity2 's @entity11 after a five - hour meeting			1
" it has been stressed that @entity2 will act with determination against this hostile action reserving all its rights arising from international law , " the statement said			1
the military deployment along @entity2 's border with @entity4 is linked to rising tensions between the neighboring nations after the jet went down , a @entity2 government official said thursday			1
the apparent bolstering of its border force comes only two days after @entity2 prime minister @entity33 said his country was changing its military rules of engagement			1
it now will treat a military approach toward its borders by @entity4 as a potential threat that " will be dealt with accordingly , " he said			2
" it seems that this is an implication of what the prime minister said in his speech , " the @entity2 official , who asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak on the record , said when questioned on reports of troop movements in the border area			1
a man from the border village of @entity51 , who asked not to be named for security reasons , said that personnel had been arriving for the past two or three days			2
" they are coming in military vehicles			2
we hear that such transfers are taking place to all border stations , " he said			0
is @entity2 moving toward ' hard power ' over @entity4 ? @entity2 state tv channel @entity61 gave details of military convoy movements in border areas on its website thursday , saying trucks loaded with tanks had been moved to a military unit on the border with @entity4			1
" there were also air - defense systems among the military transfer of military vehicles and tanks , " it reported			1
the semi-official @entity75 news agency also reported the transfer of armored vehicles to military posts in some districts of @entity80 and @entity81 , along the border , on wednesday			2
relations between the two countries , already strained , have worsened significantly since @entity4 shot down a @entity2 @entity86 jet on friday			2
both sides say the jet strayed into @entity4 airspace , but @entity2 says the incursion was accidental and quickly corrected			2
@entity4 's response drew sharp condemnation from @entity93 , but the alliance did not promise any action in response to the incident			1
@entity93 secretary general @entity98 said @entity2 did not invoke the @entity93 article calling for collective defense of members			1
@entity2 , while not seeking specific action , asked @entity93 members to study a range of ways a no - fly zone could potentially help the situation and ease threats , a senior @entity103 official said			1
it is " not clear what , if anything , will be done , " the official said			0
the request was first reported by @entity116 , which described it as a request for a " contingency plan			0
" the @entity116 cited a @entity103 government source in saying the request took members by surprise but was now being taken back to the countries ' capitals for consideration			2
for its part , the @entity103 military planning includes a scenario for a no - fly zone as well as protecting chemical and biological sites , @entity1 has reported previously			1
officials say all the scenarios would be difficult to enact and must involve large numbers of @entity103 troops and extended operations			0
meanwhile , the search for the jet 's pilots continued			0
@entity2 's chief of general staff said in an online statement thursday that an area measuring 70 miles by 23 miles has been scanned , " however neither our pilots nor the wreckage of the plane have been reached so far			1
" some parts of the plane and some items belonging to the pilots have been found , however , the statement said			0
five military vessels , a plane and four search - and - rescue helicopters have been involved in the around - the - clock search since the plane was lost , it said			0
in addition , a navy hydrographic survey ship started a deep water search tuesday			0
a @entity4 official said wednesday that his country 's forces might have thought the @entity2 jet it downed was from @entity165			1
" as you know , there is a country called @entity165 there and , as you know , this @entity171 country 's planes are very similar			0
and because they both are from the same factory , from the @entity103 , maybe @entity4 thought it was an @entity165 plane , " @entity4 information minister @entity172 told the @entity2 @entity174 channel			1
speaking tuesday in @entity178 , @entity33 stressed that his country is n't an aggressor , but will respond bluntly to threats			0
" i express this at every opportunity : we never have our eyes on any country 's lands			0
we do n't show a hostile attitude against any country			0
we never threaten the security of any country , " he said in remarks aired on @entity192			0
" we never hesitate to respond in the harshest way and do what is necessary with all our existing power , as well as with the power and inspiration that we get from our history , against hostile attitudes , attacks and threats against us			0
" @entity4 raised the stakes monday in the war of words over the incident			0
@entity209 spokesman @entity208 said the plane was shot down in @entity4 airspace , disputing @entity2 's claim that it was downed over international waters after briefly straying into @entity4 airspace by mistake			1
" what happened was a violation of @entity4 airspace			0
even @entity2 says @entity4 sovereignty was violated			2
regardless of whether it was a training mission , a reconnaissance mission , it was a violation , " @entity208 said			0
