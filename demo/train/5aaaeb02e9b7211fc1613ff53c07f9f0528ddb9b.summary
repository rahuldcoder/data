-- pope @entity1 spoke out against sexual abuse by @entity4 clergy on monday and said he plans to meet with victims in early june			1
in a wide - ranging talk with reporters , he also discussed celibacy in the clergy , saying it 's not dogma so " the door is always open			1
" the @entity1 fielded questions on these subjects during an informal chat with reporters			1
he simply walked to the back of the papal airplane , sat down with a group of journalists and took questions for about 45 minutes , answering in @entity19			2
when the @entity21 spokesman suggested he stop after half an hour to rest , the @entity1 indicated he was happy to continue			1
such informality has become a hallmark of @entity1			2
stressing that sex abuse constitutes a horrific crime , he told reporters that three bishops are under investigation			2
one has already been found guilty and a penalty is being considered , he said			0
it was not clear whether the bishops are under investigation for alleged abuse , or for purported involvement in some sort of cover - up			0
none of those clerics were named			0
a priest who abuses a child betrays the body of the @entity45 , the @entity1 said , according to pool reports			2
he called for zero tolerance			2
" this is very serious , " he said			0
" it is like , by way of comparison , holding a black @entity52 you are supposed to lead them to sanctity and instead you lead them to a problem that will last their entire lives			0
" among the expected invitees to the meeting are abuse victims from @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 , and cardinal @entity66 , the archbishop of @entity67			1
@entity68 , a spokesman for the cardinal , said the time and date of the meeting have not been finalized			0
" @entity66 has been asked by the @entity71 to assist with the planning for a meeting with survivors of sexual abuse in the coming months , " said @entity68			2
" the cardinal looks forward to supporting this effort by @entity1 in whatever manner will be most helpful			2
" the meeting at the @entity21 will not be the first time a pope has met with sexual abuse victims , according to @entity82 , @entity0 's senior @entity21 analyst			1
however , it will mark the first time @entity1 has done so			1
" this is a clear indication that @entity1 is trying to get the message out that he ' gets it ' about the need to confront the church 's abuse scandals , " @entity82 said			1
however , the @entity90 - based @entity89 said the pope 's comments did not go far enough			0
" no child rape will be prevented , no abuse cover - up will be prevented and no predator priest will be exposed by anything the pope said today or will do next month , " @entity93 , western regional director of @entity89 , said in a statement			0
" his upcoming and self - serving meeting with victims is more of what we 've seen for decades -- more gestures , promises , symbolism and public relations			0
" when reporters asked about celibacy in the clergy , @entity1 showed an open mind but did n't say he 's ready to make a change yet			1
" the @entity115 has married priests -- @entity118 @entity117 , @entity117 , those of oriental rites , " he said			0
" celibacy is not a question of dogma , but rather a rule of life that i greatly appreciate , as i believe it is a gift for the @entity115			0
but , since it is not a dogma of faith , the door is always open			0
" the pontiff spoke as he was returning to @entity132 from a three - day trip to the @entity134			1
during that trip , the @entity1 extended an invitation to the leaders of @entity137 and the @entity138 to travel to the @entity21 for peace talks			1
in comments aboard the plane , he clarified the talks would not focus on finding a solution			0
" it will be a meeting of prayer , " he said			0
the @entity1 also appeared to open the door to the possibility he might resign one day , like his predecessor , if he no longer had the strength to carry on			1
" i think that @entity1 @entity152 was not a unique case , " @entity1 told reporters			1
" i will do what @entity154 tells me to do			0
" kick out those who sexually abuse children , @entity157 panel tells @entity21 @entity21 setting up commission against sexual abuse of minors @entity0 's @entity163 contributed to this report .			1
