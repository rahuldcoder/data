@entity0 -- @entity0 officials on monday were preparing the site where a part believed to be from one of the 9/11 airliners was found so that they can begin the search for human remains , according to the @entity9			1
staff from the @entity12 will start sifting through soil for human remains on tuesday , police said			1
a @entity16 technician confirmed that the piece , discovered wednesday , is a support structure from a trailing edge flap found on the wing of a @entity16 767 like the ones that were flown into the @entity22 on september 11 , 2001			1
it could not be determined from which of the two planes the part came , police said monday			1
the piece was found in an 18 - inch gap between two buildings near ground zero			2
one of the buildings is 51 @entity31 , the site of a controversial @entity34 community center			2
surveyors who found the piece called authorities to report that they 'd found " apparently damaged machinery , " police said			1
contrary to an initial theory that the piece could have been lowered by a rope found still wrapped to it , the police department clarified monday that a police officer had attached the rope last week to maneuver the part to better see a serial number and other indicators			1
the plane part is about 5 feet long , 4 feet wide , and 17 inches deep , police commissioner @entity50 said			1
investigators are still trying to determine how the support structure became wedged into such a small space			2
" if you see how confined this space is , and you realize the chaos that existed on this street , i think it 's understandable			2
it 's not that surprising , " @entity50 said			0
" it 's very , very confined , and no construction work went on , or no clean up went on in this 18 - inch space between the two buildings " after the attacks			0
some family members of 9/11 victims are outraged by the discovery			0
@entity70 , whose son @entity71 , a probationary firefighter , died when the towers collapsed , said : " i 'm disgusted , because after 9/11 , the proper search was never done			0
the whole aftermath was uncoordinated			0
" @entity70 has been one of the leading voices and , at times , critics for the families of the 9/11 victims , pushing hard for a federal investigation and calling for a more comprehensive search for remains and debris			2
" we advocated for a huge trajectory from that collapse , " she said			0
" human remains were thrown at least for a mile , but probably 2 or 3 miles from the site			1
" in recent years , debris and human remains have been discovered in various spots around @entity90			1
police are treating the area as a crime scene and say the part of wreckage will remain there until a final home is chosen			1
in the past , the @entity97 has taken some parts , while others have become part of museums			2
@entity102 , president of @entity103 , which owns 51 @entity31 , said , " we are cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities to make sure this piece of evidence is removed with care as quickly and effectively as possible			0
" this is not the first time this building has had national attention			0
it was the center of many protests while @entity115 , the @entity34 center , was seeking permission to locate there in 2010			0
critics said the center 's proximity to ground zero was unacceptable , while supporters argued it was meant to bring people together			0
@entity1 's @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 contributed to this report .			0
