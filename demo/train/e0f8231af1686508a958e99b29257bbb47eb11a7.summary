@entity0 head to the polls to vote for their next president on monday and tuesday			0
there will be just two candidates , @entity5 and @entity6			2
@entity0 had an election recently			0
so why are they having another one ? @entity0 are voting again because @entity10 -- @entity0 's first freely elected president -- was removed from power last year in a popular military coup			1
@entity10 's ouster last july was the culmination of a months - long petition campaign to remove him from office and days of mass demonstrations against the former @entity21 leader			1
critics accused @entity10 of hijacking the 2011 revolution , pushing aside moderate and liberal voices , and botching @entity0 's already ailing economy			1
@entity10 rejected the allegations and accused @entity0 's military backed establishment and @entity30 - era loyalist of undermining his presidency			1
in a remarkable reversal of fortune the man who removed @entity10 from power - then army chief @entity5 - is now heavily favored to win the presidential election			1
@entity10 and scores of fellow members of the @entity21 are in prison facing a variety of charges			0
how will @entity21 supporters vote ? the @entity21 is not represented in the election , which is due in large part to an aggressive campaign by @entity0 authorities to eliminate the movement from @entity0 's political landscape			1
despite initial promises of an inclusive transition to a democratically elected government , @entity0 's military backed interim government banned the @entity21 last year and declared it a terrorist organization			1
today most of the group 's leadership is either in jail , in hiding , or taking refuge outside @entity0			0
both candidates - @entity5 and @entity6 - have promised to keep the @entity21 out of @entity0 politics if elected president			1
the @entity62 - led by former @entity21 leader @entity63 - has decided to boycott the vote			0
the ultra-conservative @entity65 supported the 2012 election of @entity10 but is now drawing criticism from @entity69 groups for supporting candidate @entity5			2
what are the policies of each candidate ? both candidates have generally remained vague on policy details , choosing instead to make populist promises that play well in television interviews			1
and , both promise to fix @entity0 's failing economy , though neither has detailed how they plan to create jobs , generate revenue , and cut costly food and fuel subsidies -- a move many fear will anger @entity0 's poor			2
@entity5 vows to keep @entity0 safe by continuing the " war on terrorism , " a reference to the recent rise in low - level insurgent attacks against security forces			0
critics fear @entity5 will exploit that narrative to stifle free speech and continue a crackdown against dissent that has been sharply criticized by international rights groups			0
@entity6 promises to release what rights groups describe as thousands of political prisoners and ban a controversial protest law , which says groups of ten or more can not gather in public without prior government permission			0
who is likely to win ? and will the winner finally bring stability to the country ? @entity5 is heavily favored to win due in large part to widespread support from @entity0 's powerful establishment , which includes the military , the private and state media apparatus , and @entity0 's political and financial elite			1
@entity5 also has popular support from @entity0 who see him as the man who saved @entity0 from a @entity10 presidency that was perceived by many to be pursing an @entity69 agenda			2
less certain , however , is whether the next president can bring stability to @entity0 , and lure back millions of tourists who have stayed away due to more than three years of political unrest			0
to establish stability @entity0 's next president must make tangible improvements to the economy , improve security , and address mounting criticism from rights groups and pro-democracy activists who fear a return to a @entity30 - era style police state			2
how will the election result affect the region and the rest of the world ? the outcome of the vote will likely bolster @entity0 's relations with key allies @entity143 , @entity144 , and @entity145 -- @entity147 states that poured in billions of dollars in funding to support the @entity0 government after the ouster of former president @entity10			1
relations with @entity151 and @entity152 -- staunch supporters of @entity10 and the @entity21 --- will remain tense			0
the @entity154 and @entity156 powers will likely continue to voice concern about @entity0 's alleged human rights violations but will continue relations as long as @entity0 honors its peace treaty with @entity162 and is n't viewed as a disruptive force in an already volatile region			0
an el - @entity166 presidency would be a potential blow to pro-democracy movements in other @entity170 states who hoped the 2011 @entity172 would mark the end of regimes led military strongmen .			0

there are just two candidates in @entity0 's presidential election , with polling due on may *26* , *27*
*ex-general* @entity5 faces left - leaning politician @entity6
the election follows last year 's ouster of @entity21 president @entity10
