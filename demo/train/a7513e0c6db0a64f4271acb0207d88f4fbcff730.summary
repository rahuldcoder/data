@entity0 -- baseball all - time home run champion @entity2 won a big legal victory friday when a federal appeals court ruled that evidence the government says would prove he lied about using steroids is inadmissible in court			1
the @entity12 - based 9th @entity11 , in a divided opinion , said the government can not use urine samples and other evidence in its perjury case against the former @entity17 star			2
@entity2 was indicted in federal court in december 2008 on 10 counts of making false statements to a grand jury -- specifically , denying that he knowingly took steroids and other performance - enhancing drugs			1
his criminal trial has been delayed while the legal issues are being worked out			0
it was unclear whether the @entity27 will now appeal to the @entity28 in an effort to allow the evidence to be used in court			2
the @entity33 ruling upholds a february 2009 ruling from @entity36 district judge @entity35 that there was no proof that positive steroid tests from 2000 and 2001 were @entity2 ' and that out - of - court statements from his former trainer , @entity41 , are hearsay			1
the appeals court majority said the repeated refusal of @entity41 to testify against @entity2 means evidence allegedly gathered by him is considered " inadmissible , since he would be unable to vouch for its authenticity			1
" @entity51 , a professor at the @entity52 said the ruling essentially torpedoes the prosecution 's case , which was heavily dependent on evidence and information from @entity2 ' former trainer			1
" there was a link missing here , that the only way to get down to the nitty - gritty that this was from @entity2 was using hearsay testimony , " @entity51 said			1
@entity41 , he said , " had possession of the evidence and he had that knowledge , and you ca n't use that knowledge unless he actually testifies under oath			0
" " to try and prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt , particularly in @entity12 where there are going to be many , many people chosen for a jury who would be behind @entity2 -- it should be the death knell , " @entity51 said			1
" practically speaking they should say , ' we gave it our best shot , and it 's just not there , ' " he said			0
@entity41 allegedly took urine samples and delivered them to a bay - area lab known as @entity88			2
at issue in the appeal was whether the tested samples actually came from @entity92 , and @entity41 's employment status at the time			1
the appeals court concluded @entity41 was an " independent contractor " -- not directly hired by @entity92			0
because @entity2 also did not control the samples , the court reasoned , @entity41 would need to testify in person on the material and the chain of possession			1
the government said it would instead bring @entity88 executive @entity102 to the stand to testify @entity41 told him the samples indeed came from @entity92			1
the court ultimately agreed with the arguments presented by @entity2 ' lawyers			1
" because the government was attempting to use @entity41 's out - of - court statements to prove the truth of what they contained , @entity2 argued that @entity41 's statements were inadmissible hearsay and that the lab results could not be authenticated as @entity2 ' in that manner			1
" @entity2 hit a record - setting 73 homers in the 2001 season			1
that same year , as well as before and after , the @entity116 said @entity117 recorded urine and blood tests , under the name " @entity2 , " showing " positive " results for steroids and performance - enchancing drugs			1
the government had the burden of showing the samples came from @entity92 , then went to @entity41 and then to @entity88			2
@entity41 has refused to testify and has been jailed for contempt of court on several occasions			2
" there must be at least some manifestation of assent to the principal 's right to control , " said the court of @entity92			0
" here , the testing was performed on @entity41 's own initiative and not at the request of @entity2			2
the dissent incorrectly assumes otherwise			0
thus , the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that @entity41 was not an agent for the limited purpose of the drug testing			0
" the government alleges @entity88 helped supply bonds with steroids and drug - masking substances			0
@entity88 was accused of covertly marketing tetrahydrogestrinone -- known as " the @entity149 " -- a then - undetectable performance - enhancing steroid			0
@entity153 founder @entity152 and associates such as @entity41 allegedly supplied other top athletes with the @entity149 and human growth hormone , assuring the competitors they would not be caught cheating			0
the lab performed repeated tests on athletes , said the government , to check whether the drugs were detectable			0
top professional football and track stars were caught up in the scandal , prosecutors say			0
steroid use was banned by @entity168 in 2003			0
neither the government nor @entity2 had an immediate reaction to the ruling			2
in light of the decision , it remains unclear whether the criminal trail will proceed			0
the case is @entity36 v. @entity2 ( 09 - 10079 )			2
@entity1 's @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0

new : law professor : " it should be the death knell " for prosecution
@entity33 says there is no proof that the steroid tests were from @entity2
former trainer , who reportedly said samples came from @entity2 , refuses to testify
