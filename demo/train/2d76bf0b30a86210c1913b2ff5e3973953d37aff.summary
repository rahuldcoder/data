-- roads ripped to rubble by floodwaters up to 10 feet deep , rushing at speeds of up to 30 mph			1
shattered homes near others still standing upright			1
one person dead , two others missing			1
that 's the harsh reality police , firefighters and residents were dealing with saturday in @entity12 , a mountain community of about 5,000 people just west of @entity14 , after sudden , raging waters tore through the area			1
under mostly sunny skies , crews spent the day looking for the missing and combing through wreckage wrought by floods triggered by intense rain			1
locals such as @entity24 , meanwhile , tried to make sense of what happened			2
he was in a @entity12 cafe , working on its owner 's computer , on friday when water suddenly , perilously started flowing in front of the building			1
he and others -- one of them wheelchair - bound -- heard the water rushing below them as they finally got in an elevator and crept up to safety			2
" it was like a raging river , a black river coming down , " @entity24 told @entity0 affiliate @entity39 , dry after his 2Â½ hour ordeal the day earlier			1

some communities bracing for wet weather were coping with the aftermath of earlier devastating floods			2
a flash flood watch was in effect through 9 p.m. ( 11 p.m. et ) in @entity12 , for instance , given the threat that could be caused by more heavy rains			1
the dangers there are exacerbated by last year 's mammoth @entity91 wildfire , which -- as lt. @entity92 of the @entity93 explained -- made the soil saturated , unstable , " kind of waxy " and little help in curbing rushing waters			2
" it 's like liquid cement , " @entity92 told @entity39 , noting that those caught up in the rocks , trees and other debris have little chance to escape			0
" ... you 're not swimming out of this			0
it will rip your clothes off			0
