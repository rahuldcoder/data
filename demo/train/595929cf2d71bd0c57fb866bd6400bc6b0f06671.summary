the plane was approaching @entity6 under a beautifully clear sky , but it was flying low			2
@entity8 looked out the window from seat @entity10 and said he could see the water of the @entity12 about 10 feet below			0
even for an airport where landing strips run close to the water , the descent seemed alarming to the @entity12 man			0
" i do n't see any runway , i just see water , " @entity8 recalled			2
further back in the @entity21 , @entity20 had the same realization			0
" looking through window , it looked on level of the ( sea ) wall along the runway , " he posted on @entity23 , @entity24 's equivalent of @entity25			1
latest developments on the crash then , with no warning from the cockpit , the plane slammed onto the edge of the runway			1
the impact severed the plane 's tail and sent the rest of it spinning on its belly			1
a massive fireball and clouds of smoke shot skyward			0
first responders rushed to the scene as horrified onlookers at the airport terminal feared the worst			0
medics found the bodies of two @entity24 girls on the runway , next to the burning wreckage			1

remarkably , 305 others on the plane survived the crash saturday morning			1
a total of 70 @entity24 students and teachers were headed to summer camp in the @entity71 , @entity24 's state - run @entity66 news agency reported			1
" we 're lucky there has n't been a greater loss of life , " @entity12 fire chief @entity72 said			0
when rescuers arrived , they found some passengers coming out of the water			1
" there was a fire on the plane , so the assumption might be that they went near the water 's edge , which is very shallow , to maybe douse themselves with water , " @entity72 said			1
why this flight was survivable while 182 of them were taken to hospitals with injuries ranging from spinal fractures to bruises , another 123 managed to escape unharmed			1
some jumped out or slid down emergency chutes with luggage in hand			0
harrowing flight the crash ended an otherwise mundane flight that originated in @entity103 , @entity24			1
it made a connection in @entity106 , @entity107 , before flying 10 hours to @entity12			0
among the 291 passengers were 141 @entity24 , 77 @entity107 , 61 @entity71 and one @entity110 , @entity108 said			1
the airline is one of two major airlines in @entity107 ; the other is @entity115			0
at the helm of the plane was one of @entity108 's veteran pilots who had been flying for 17 years , the airline said sunday			1
three other pilots were also on board , working in shifts			0
once the plane fell short of the runway , passengers found themselves on a roller coaster			1
" i thought as the plane was landing , it looked like the pilot was trying to take off again , " passenger @entity127 said			2
expert : flight should n't have been close to seawall " and then just boom , the back end just hit and flies up in the air , " @entity137 , another passenger , said , " and everybody 's head goes up to the ceiling			1
" dark gray smoke rose from the plane as it lay on its belly , with no landing gear evident			2
its roof was charred and , in spots , gone			0
the back of the plane had been lopped off entirely			2
flames and smoke burst out of its windows			0
" honestly , i was waiting for the plane to ... start flipping upside down , in which case i think a lot of people would have not made it , " @entity8 said			1
" if we flipped , none of us would be here to talk about it			0
" @entity20 and his wife were among the fortunate			0
" we quickly slung on luggage and grabbed our child and walked toward the back , " @entity20 said on @entity23			0
" saw the kitchen at back mostly disappeared			0
a huge hole -- very round			0
only after coming out did we see three of us had slight bruises			0
" the big question exactly what caused the crash could take up to two years to determine , said @entity169 , head of @entity107 's @entity170			1
' i just crash landed			2
surreal ' @entity107 investigators will work alongside officials from the @entity176			1
the flight recorders from the plane have been recovered and are on the way to @entity180 , the @entity176 said sunday			1
the airline purchased the plane , a @entity182 , in march 2006			2
@entity108 ceo and president @entity184 said there was no engine failure , to his knowledge			2
" the company will conduct an accurate analysis on the cause of this accident and take strong countermeasures for safe operation in the future with the lesson learned from this accident , " @entity184 said			0
the survivors many of those who survived the crash chalked it to divine intervention			0
" i think it 's miraculous that we have survived because things could have been much worse , " said passenger @entity203			0
@entity207 , @entity208 's chief operating officer and author of the book " @entity211 , " was supposed to be on flight 214			2
but she switched to a @entity214 flight , arriving about 20 minutes before the @entity108 flight crashed			1
" serious moment to give thanks , " she wrote on her @entity208 page not the first time prior to saturday 's disaster , @entity108 endured two deadly crashes over the past 20 years			1
in 1993 , a crash near @entity107 's @entity222 killed 68 of the 116 people on board			1
the @entity226 went down in poor weather as the plane was attempting its third landing , the @entity225 said			0
and in 2011 , a cargo plane headed from @entity106 to @entity103 slammed into the @entity231 , killing the only two people on board			2
perhaps one of the reasons so many people survived saturday 's crash was because the @entity21 is built so that everybody can get off the plane within 90 seconds , even if half the doors are inoperable			1
still , many questions linger			0
@entity184 , @entity108 's president and ceo , told reporters he could not confirm many details of the crash , pending the investigation			1
