more than 5 million @entity0 are living with @entity1 's today , with another person developing the disease every 68 seconds			1
by 2050 , the number of people living with @entity1 's disease is expected to triple			1
as if those numbers were n't staggering enough , consider this : alzheimer 's disease is the only cause of death among the top 10 ( it 's currently ranked no. 6 ) in the @entity0 that ca n't be prevented , cured or slowed down			1
ask any expert , and he or she will tell you that early diagnosis is key to helping patients live better day to day , so even though the disease is still progressing , the symptoms are less harsh			1
" our hope is that if we could identify patients who are developing the disease early , it would give us a much better opportunity to intervene with treatments , and it 's much more likely for those treatments to be effective , " says dr. @entity21 , chairman of neurosurgery at @entity23			2
but while early diagnosis leads to early intervention , some news out of the 2013 @entity31 is troubling : an expert panel found 16 online tests for @entity1 scored poorly on scales of overall scientific validity , reliability and ethical factors			1
" self - diagnosis behavior ... is increasingly popular online , and freely accessible quizzes that call themselves ' tests ' for @entity1 's are available on the @entity47 , " says @entity39 , who presented the data this week in @entity41			1
" however , little is known about the scientific validity and reliability of these offerings and ethics - related factors , including research and commercial conflict of interest , confidentiality and consent			2
" " frankly , " @entity39 adds , " what we found online was distressing and potentially harmful			0
" @entity39 and her colleagues at the @entity60 found that unique monthly visitors for the parent sites hosting the online tests reached as high as 8.8 million			0
at the same conference , another study concluded that the misdiagnosis of alzheimer 's disease in @entity69 patients who actually have vascular dementia or parkinson 's disease leads to substantial excess costs of care			1
the study , conducted by @entity75 and @entity76 , found the costs of erroneous care to be in excess of $ 14,000 a year per patient			0
the silver lining : those excess costs decline and eventually dissipate following a correct diagnosis			0
" recent developments in technology have greatly improved our ability to properly diagnose patients with cognitive impairment , " said @entity75 's @entity83			2
" our results suggest that there are economic benefits to properly diagnosing -- as early as possible -- the cause of the cognitive impairment			0
" if you suspect a family member or friend is developing @entity1 's , take a look at these 10 warning signs of @entity1 , put together by the @entity31 : 1.memory changes that disrupt daily life @entity101 in planning or solving problems @entity104 completing familiar tasks at home , at work , or at leisure 4.confusion with time or place 5.trouble understanding visual images and spatial relationships 6.new problems with words in speaking or writing 7.misplacing things and losing the ability to retrace steps 8.decreased or poor judgment 9.withdrawal from work or social activities 10.changes in mood and personality rather than diagnose alzheimer 's disease at home , head to your doctor 's office			1
you can also find more information at www.alz.org , or by calling the @entity31 's 24 - hour hotline at ( 800 ) 272 - 3900			0
the importance of early detection and early intervention ca n't be stressed strongly enough			0
it could mean added years of lucidity and life for you or someone you love			0
the first chapter in fighting @entity1 's			2

early diagnosis is key for helping @entity1 's patients , experts say
16 online @entity1 's tests scored poorly on scientific validity , reliability and ethics
rather than diagnose alzheimer 's disease at home , head to the doctor 's office
