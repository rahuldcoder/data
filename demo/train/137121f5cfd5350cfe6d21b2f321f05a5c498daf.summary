-- @entity1 has long been the poster boy @entity3 explorer who found fame and fortune by sailing from the @entity8 to the @entity9			1
crossing the great unknown waters between @entity11 and the @entity12 in 1492 , he became one of the most renowned -- and pivotal -- @entity14 to set foot in @entity16			2
but more than five centuries later , a @entity18 adventurer plans to show that the @entity19 could have been reached by another seafaring nation 2,000 years before @entity1			1
former @entity22 officer @entity21 hopes to sail a replica @entity24 boat 10,000 kilometers across the @entity25 in an ambitious voyage that could challenge maritime history			1
by completing the journey , @entity21 aims to demonstrate that the @entity29 -- the ancient @entity31 civilization that prospered from @entity32 to @entity33 -- had the capability to sail to the @entity35 ; a theory disputed by historians			1
" it is one of the greatest voyages of mankind and if anyone could have done it [ before @entity1 ] , it was the @entity29 , " said @entity21			1
" of all the ancient civilizations they were the greatest seafarers -- @entity48 had cedar trees perfect for building strong boats , they were the first to use iron nails , and they had knowledge of astronomy and currents			0
" the prospect of sailing a 50 - ton wooden vessel identical to those built 2,600 years ago across the @entity25 might appear foolhardy , had @entity21 not already challenged maritime history two years ago			2
@entity21 sailed the replica boat -- aptly named the @entity29 -- around @entity61 in 2010 , in a bid to demonstrate the ancient civilization had the capability to circumnavigate the continent 2,000 years before the first recorded @entity14 ; @entity66 , in 1488			1
setting sail from @entity68 in 2008 , the @entity29 covered 32,000 kilometers over two years , battling everything from six - meter waves off the @entity71 to @entity73 pirates			1
" we had run the gauntlet of pirate - infested waters , overcome numerous technical problems and traveled deep into the @entity81 and @entity25 , " @entity21 says in a new book on the incredible voyage ; ' @entity76			2
' " i had proved she was an ocean - going vessel and when she was coasting along the waves , her sail billowing in the wind ; to captain her had been an unforgettable experience			0
" @entity21 based his ambitious quest on a quote by @entity93 historian @entity92 , who claimed the @entity29 circumnavigated @entity61 in @entity94			1
along with their sophisticated seafaring skills , the @entity29 were renowned as an intellectual and industrious civilization who helped develop the alphabet we still use today			1
highly skilled in metalwork , ivory carving and glass - making , the name @entity29 derives from the iconic purple color they used to dye their superior textiles			2
dr @entity107 , maritime archaeologist at the @entity108 , added that a @entity24 voyage around @entity61 was " quite a plausible undertaking , based on the capabilities of the vessel of the period and historical material stating it took place			2
" the boat was modeled on an ancient 19 - meter @entity24 shipwreck excavated off the coast of @entity120			2
using locally - sourced materials , shipbuilders stayed true to the original down to the exact thickness of the planks and position of the mast			0
the crew of volunteers ranged from six to 15 people at any time , with 53 sailors from 14 different countries taking part over the entire journey			0
" we did n't have any mechanical winches and the anchor had to be pulled up and down by hand -- it was back - breaking work , " @entity21 said			0
" there was just one traditional toilet which dropped straight into the ocean , so you literally had to step out on the side of the boat to use it			0
when you had big waves coming at you in the middle of the night it could be quite scary			0
but at least there was no cleaning			0
" the final leg of the journey took them wide out across the @entity25 and a mere 965 kilometers off the coast of @entity156			2
it was here @entity21 got his inspiration for the journey to the @entity35 " archeologists have found @entity162 mummies with traces of tobacco and cocaine which could only have come from the @entity19 , " @entity21 said			2
" it indicates there was something going on across the @entity25			0
" dr @entity169 , professor of geology at @entity171 , also points to evidence of @entity24 coins bearing maps of the @entity8 and @entity19			1
he said copper coins with @entity24 iconography have also also been discovered in @entity16			1
" the available evidence suggests that the @entity178 ( the western tribe of the @entity29 ) had the ability to cross the @entity25 at will , " he said			1
many historians however , remain doubtful			0
" if the @entity29 got to @entity182 -- which we think they did -- i would n't be surprised if the boat could get to @entity16 physically			1
but whether they could have done it without running out of food is a different matter , " maritime historian @entity186 said			0
" if you 're circumnavigating @entity61 you can always stop along the way			0
but you ca n't when you 're going to @entity16 -- it 's a massive stretch of sea and that 's the difference			0
" setting off from @entity198 , the modern - day @entity24 vessel is expected to take two to three months to reach @entity16 -- granted @entity21 can raise Â £ 100,000 ( $ 156,000 ) for the expedition			1
@entity201 's @entity200 has already invited him to display the boat as part of their upcoming exhibition on the @entity29 , opening in september 2014			0
" the conventional wisdom is that @entity1 discovered @entity16			1
but anyone who looks a little closer will see the @entity208 were there around @entity210			0
they 've found @entity214 settlements in @entity215 , it 's undisputed , " @entity21 said			0
" so @entity1 was definitely second -- at best			0
i put forward the theory that the @entity29 could have been first and i hope to prove that was the case			1

@entity18 adventurer aims to sail replica @entity24 *sailboat* across @entity25
journey could prove ancient civilization capable of reaching @entity16
could challenge theory @entity1 first discovered @entity19
historian dispute *likelihood* @entity29 landed in @entity16
