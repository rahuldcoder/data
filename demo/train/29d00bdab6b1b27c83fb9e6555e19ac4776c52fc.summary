-- inspired by @entity8 verse 11 -- " for as the heaven is high above the earth , so great is his mercy toward those that fear him " -- two men with lofty ambitions in a midwestern town of the @entity13 have finally realized them after months of endeavor -- and then some			0
in july 2012 , in a bid to attract golfers and tourists to the @entity19 in @entity20 -- a town with a population of just under 3,000 -- @entity26 operations manager @entity23 and the company 's vice president @entity24 concocted the idea of building a golf tee of biblical proportions			1
the two men hope the 30 ft ยพ structure , which has those words from @entity8 carved into its wooden edifice , will be officially crowned the world 's largest golf tee			1
it is not the first over-sized @entity26 construction -- last year the company produced the world 's largest wind chime , a 55 - foot long structure now proudly hanging in @entity43			1
hours of chainsaw carving , 60 gallons of glue and 120 pounds of screws were involved in the making of the colossal tee , which weighs 6,659 pounds and consists of yellow pine boards			2
measurements were taken and sent to the @entity51 , with the club hoping it will be officially verified as the world 's biggest tee , possibly as early as next week			1
it will be sited on the 10th hole on the @entity43 course , although that is just the start for @entity60 and @entity61 to put @entity43 on the tourist map			2
if the record is confirmed , an 18 ft diameter hollowed out golf ball will be constructed to sit atop the tee , from where golfers will be able to tee off			1
" hopefully our world 's largest tee construction receives the @entity51 recognition next week , " @entity60 told @entity0			1
" we have plans to erect the tee this spring at the @entity19			0
prior to the installation , there is a lot of prep work to do -- earthwork and landscaping -- that will accompany the world 's largest golf tee			1
" we truly hope this will be a draw to golfers and visitors worldwide , " added @entity60			0
" once the tee is erected , we plan to build the ball for the top			2
this ball will be constructed so golfers will be able to tee out of it			0
this portion of the project will be completed later this year			0
to maximize the potential pulling power of having the world 's biggest tee in @entity43 , @entity60 is also thinking on a grand scale to market the town 's gargantuan landmark			1
" we have contacted a world famous golfer and invited him to be the first to tee off of it when it is ready for the grand opening , " said @entity24 's operations manager			2
" if you know of any other famous golfers that would like to be a part of this , by all means please pass along my contact information to them as we would love to have them			0
" we would also plan to offer the opportunity to ' sponsor the @entity114 ' to the major golf companies			0
" the current record is 26 ft 8in and belongs to the students of @entity118 at @entity119 ( all @entity13 ) in @entity120 , @entity13 , on 23 july 2009			0
the students ' effort had a head diameter of 88.9 cm ( 35 in ) and a shaft width of 35.24 cm ( 13.87 in ) .			0

a golf course in @entity43 , @entity20 hopes to soon boast the world 's largest golf tee
the measurements of the 30ft pine structure have been sent to @entity51
@entity26 has already built the world largest wind chime
the course hopes to add a giant ball to top the tee if the record is confirmed
