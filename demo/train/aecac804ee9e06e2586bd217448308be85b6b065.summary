@entity2 @entity0 appears to have beheaded one of its @entity5 hostages and is demanding the release of a convicted terrorist in @entity8 to spare the other			1
a video file posted online saturday by a known @entity0 supporter shows an image of one hostage , @entity14 , holding a photo of what appears to be the corpse of his fellow captive , @entity20			1
the voice of a person claiming to be @entity14 speaks over the image , saying in @entity24 that @entity5 prime minister @entity25 is to blame for @entity20 's death			1
" you were given a deadline , " he says , referring to @entity0 ' earlier demand that @entity5 pay $ 200 million by friday to save the lives of the two hostages			1
the voice then announces a new ultimatum : the release of @entity35 , an @entity36 woman facing the death penalty in @entity8 for her role in a series of bombings in 2005 that killed dozens of people at hotels in the @entity44 kingdom			1
@entity45 , an @entity0 - affiliated online station , reported the extremist group 's killing of @entity20 and the prisoner swap demand for @entity50 in its newscast sunday			1
it did n't identify @entity14 by name			0
@entity25 condemned the apparent killing of @entity20 and called for @entity14 to be released immediately			0
" such act of terrorism is outrageous and impermissible , which causes me nothing but strong indignation , " he said			0
experts are analyzing the video , which seems " highly credible , " @entity25 said , an assessment shared by @entity63 authorities , who said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity			2
but @entity14 's stepfather , @entity67 , raised doubts about whether it was his stepson 's voice in the video			2
" i get the sense it 's not his voice , " he told reporters			0
" i 've heard his @entity24 a couple times			0
i felt it was a bit different			0
" @entity25 declined to comment on how his government would respond to the new demand , which does n't appear to have a clear deadline			2
" i would be surprised if the @entity8 government or @entity5 really pushed forward and released this female suicide bomber as @entity0 has requested , " said @entity1 global affairs analyst @entity80 , referring to @entity81 , whose explosives failed to go off in the hotel attack in which she participated			1
after @entity0 released the first video of the hostages tuesday , @entity5 set up a crisis center in @entity8 and said it was trying to communicate with the militant group through third parties , such as governments in the region and tribal leaders			1
@entity5 officials declined to explicitly rule out paying a ransom but said they would n't yield to terrorism			0
they stressed that an aid package @entity25 had pledged to countries affected by @entity0 , cited by the militant group as the reason for the huge ransom demand , was only for humanitarian purposes			1
but the @entity5 efforts appear to have failed to save @entity20 , 42 , whose father was struggling to come to terms with the news			2
" i still do n't want to believe it , " @entity107 told @entity5 broadcaster @entity108 , his face not shown in the report			0
" if i can see him again , i 'd like to hold him in my arms			1
" @entity14 's mother , @entity114 , had made an emotional plea friday for the release of her son , saying he is n't an enemy of @entity0			1
" @entity14 always has been a kind person ever since he was little , " she said			0
" he was always saying , ' i want to save the lives of children in war zones			0
' " @entity14 , 47 , is an experienced freelance journalist who frequently reported from war zones			0
he met @entity20 , who had dreams of setting up a private security firm , while they were both in @entity127 last year , according to friends			0
after @entity20 was reported to have been captured in august , @entity14 apparently decided to leave his wife and two young daughters in @entity5 to go into @entity0 territory to try to extricate him			1
" i asked my son 's wife why he had made this decision , and the response was that my son felt he had to do everything in his power to help and rescue his friend , " @entity67 said			0
but rather than save @entity20 , @entity14 ended up becoming another captive in the hands of a brutal militant group that has slaughtered countless @entity36 and @entity127 , as well as three @entity63 and two @entity143			1
@entity63 president @entity145 spoke with @entity25 by phone sunday from @entity147 , the @entity144 said			0
@entity145 offered " condolences for the murder " of @entity20 by @entity0 and conveyed " solidarity with the @entity5 people , " according to a statement			1
@entity145 had condemned the killing in an earlier statement saturday , saying the @entity63 will work with its ally " to bring the perpetrators of these murders to justice and will continue to take decisive action to degrade and ultimately defeat " @entity0			1
@entity143 prime minister @entity160 said the apparent beheading of @entity162 and @entity0 ' threats are " yet another reminder of the murderous barbarity of these terrorists			1
" he suggested @entity5 was right not to bow to the terrorists ' demand for ransom , saying that " @entity143 strongly supports the firm stance prime minister @entity25 and his government have taken			2
" the @entity63 and @entity143 both refuse to pay ransoms to terrorists			0
but other countries , notably @entity177 , have reportedly spent tens of millions of dollars on the release of hostages held by @entity181 militants in recent years , despite denying it publicly			2
@entity5 has also paid kidnappers to free its citizens in the past , according to the @entity185			0
in 1999 , @entity2 handed over $ 3 million for the release of four mining experts held in @entity189 , the newspaper reported			2
opinion : what hostage crisis means for @entity5 @entity1 's @entity192 reported from @entity2 , and @entity193 reported and wrote from @entity194			2
@entity1 's @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report .			0
