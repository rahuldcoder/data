on the northern @entity3 island of @entity4 , the life of a horse may be tracked down two distinct paths			1
one is long - lived , the horse bred to exhibit its utmost power and beauty			2
the other is cut straight to the bone , a life that is transient and transformed in an instant			0
@entity16 's black - and - white photo series " tracks " is a journey down both of those paths			1
racehorse breeding has become a common practice and a significant economic activity for those in @entity4			1
from the moment a horse is born , it is inevitably subject to the watchful eyes of judgment			2
if born healthy , able to stand up strong on its newly formed young limbs , the pony will spend its life on the path to becoming a racehorse			2
but , if born with any kind of defect , the pony will instead tumble down a much darker path , slaughtered for both animal and human food consumption			2
@entity16 's " tracks " provides viewers with a direct view of the two distinct paths , from eager audiences waiting for the start of a horse race , to an eerily empty , lifeless stable			1
" tracks " was certainly not an easy series for @entity16 to undertake			1
" the most tough part was that there was no slaughterhouse ( that would ) let me cover it , " @entity16 said via email			1
through the introduction of a friend , however , @entity16 was eventually able to photograph a small private farm after his two - month search			1
social media follow @ @entity60 on @entity61 to join the conversation about photography			0
" i felt a lot while shooting , " @entity16 said			1
" the most emotional moment was when a horse was shot in its forehead with a gun			2
... that was a thought - provoking time for me			0
i kept staring at the horse changing to meat			0
i 've never seen such a thing before			0
" the ages of 16 and 21 are often viewed as significant moments in many people 's lives , and this is especially true for @entity16			1
at 16 , @entity16 attended a horse race for the first time			1
five years later , he ate horse meat			0
the combination of these two experiences led him on an investigation into the memories of his past			0
" i wanted to understand how ( my experiences ) can connect , " @entity16 said			1
" tracks " is ultimately a series in which @entity16 descends deep into his memories in order to produce an emotional exploration of life and death			1
it leaves viewers to consider the distinction between the path of life and that of death : is one path truly more bright and hopeful , or more dark and helpless , than the other ? the decision to shoot in black and white is especially poignant			0
" this world has color , as you know , " @entity16 said			2
" but i want to see this world simpler			0
i want to see texture beyond the color , and i want you to evoke your imagination			0
" @entity16 was raised in @entity112 , a prefecture just outside of @entity113			2
having studied architecture and anthropology while in college , his career in photography began nine years ago			0
since then , he has published two photo books , " @entity120 " and " @entity121 , " and has received several awards , including first prize for the @entity124 in 2013			0
what one finds consistent in all of @entity16 's work is his endless curiosity about his surroundings and people			1
" in my career in photography , " he said , " one thing i 've always thought is my priority to enjoy the journey , the process			0
... the important thing is to live my own life with curiosity , and then i can talk about photography			0
" @entity16 is a @entity3 photographer based in @entity113			1
you can follow him on @entity141 and @entity61 .			0

but if there are any defects , the path is eventually slaughter
