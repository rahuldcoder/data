@entity0 -- hold the shark 's fin soup			2
cancel the elaborate @entity5 parties			2
those are some of the new directives from @entity0 now being relayed to government officials across @entity9			1
" we used to get together for a big banquet before the @entity15 holidays , " a local official told me last week			2
even in obligatory official banquets , we are also banned from serving dishes like sharks fin , bird 's nest and all that stuff			1
" and who is telling you that , i inquired			0
" the @entity25 , " he replied , nodding his head			0
in the past four decades that i 've lived and worked in @entity9 , dining has always been a big part of my social and professional activities			1
in @entity9 , like anywhere , one of the best ways to know people and conduct business is to share a meal			1
i have enjoyed sharing luscious -- and not necessarily expensive -- meals with @entity9 friends and associates			1
i particularly love dumplings , @entity0 duck and spicy @entity40 food			0
i have also eaten and drunk my way through many of the government 's traditional 12 - course banquets , which sometimes left me dyspeptic and dizzy			1
in that sense , at least , it 's good news that @entity0 is slashing the bureaucrat 's entertainment budget and scaling back on ostentatious banquet binges			1
but not all in @entity9 are pleased			2
many restaurants , shops , spas and recreation centers that have largely banked on government - sponsored spending sprees -- especially during holidays -- are hurting badly			2
" our business is down this year , " @entity59 , a @entity0 restauranteur , told me			0
" many of our usual customers from government agencies have canceled their @entity66 banquets			2
we 're down by nearly half			0
" @entity68 , an employee at a " recreation village " in suburban @entity0 , recalled receiving over 30 groups of customers from state - owned enterprises in january last year			0
as of last month they have only had a few individual customers			0
" what has been affected is not just the food business , " wrote the @entity76 newspaper in a commentary entitled " the @entity78			0
" " the banquet has created a complete chain , and all the other related industries will be affected if the banquet shrinks			0
" but some do not think the changes will be lasting			0
" this is what officials usually do after they take up office , " wrote a micro-blogger on @entity88 , @entity9 's micro-blogging site			1
" the society will relapse in three years , and then those officials will be even more greedy and corrupt to compensate for what they lost			0
@entity97 wolves will never become vegetarians			0
" this , analysts say , may be just a " new guard , new policy " scenario			0
" @entity106 , " a new broom sweeps clean , so says the the @entity9 saying			2
since @entity108 , 59 , took over as the paramount leader of @entity9 in november , he has rolled out a raft of decrees aimed at changing the leaders ' " working style			1
" " compared with their predecessors , the new leaders seem to show more sophistication , confidence and ambition , " said @entity114 , a political science professor at the @entity115			0
" they want to give unscripted speeches and hold shorter meetings			0
they call for the realization of ' the @entity9 dream ' or @entity9 's renaissance			1
" @entity108 has pledged to curb ostentatious displays among officials			1
last week he ordered a ban on television advertisements selling bling			0
he has also banned the unnecessary use of red carpets and banners during meetings			0
he has even threatened to scrap sacrosanct perks , like the road - clogging motorcades and traffic controls arranged for leaders			0
" such a working style must first start with the members of the @entity142 , " read a statement of the @entity142 , the @entity146 's top policy - making body , issued just two weeks after @entity108 's ascension			1
" if you want people to do something , then do it yourself first ; if you do n't want somebody to do something , then certainly do not do it yourself			0
" analysts say the statement reflected @entity108 's desire to win back trust in the government			1
the recent cost - cutting reforms , analysts say , are meant to remind officials to stick to business and cut back on the perks			1
" @entity108 's directive to officials to improve their work style and decrease their pomp and privileges is a challenge to the system , resonating with public anger and giving voice to public frustration , " said @entity9 analyst and author @entity165			1
the list of public grievances is long , including rampant graft and corruption , environmental degradation and the growing gap between the rich and the poor			1
@entity9 this week approved sweeping income distribution reforms to make state - owned enterprises and the rich pay more in taxes			1
the government pledged to double the average real income of urban and rural residents by 2020 from the 2010 level			0
many @entity9 cities are poised to increase workers ' minimum wage -- in southern @entity195 province , as much as 14 % starting in may -- to put more disposable income into the hands of more @entity9			2
the goal : to boost domestic consumption and narrow the gap between the rich and the poor			1
@entity108 's gambit work , and will it last ? it 's too early to say			1
still , analysts give @entity108 credit for trying			1
" for @entity108 to do so much so quickly to differentiate the new generation of leaders from the previous one is quite startling , unprecedented in a one - party political system that claims no - surprise , long - term continuity as a virtue , " explained @entity165			2
he says @entity108 has no choice but to back change			1
" reform is change , and change is risk , " he explained			0
" but in @entity9 now , perhaps for the first time , the risk of not reforming is higher than the risk of reforming			2
" @entity223 contributed to this report .			0
