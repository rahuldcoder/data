if you 're single , you will likely find yourself assessing and reassessing your love life			0
your @entity4 feed full of perfectly filtered photos of roses , chocolates and @entity9 kisses will be a constant reminder that you are not in love and not in a relationship			1
meanwhile , an endless string of engagement announcements on @entity15 might lead you to question your singlehood and wonder what you have been doing wrong			0
you might even find yourself vowing to find a significant other by next year 's @entity19 's so that you can be the one tweeting about finding that perfect gift			1
but how ? should you follow the old - fashioned pathway to love ? put on a little black dress , hit the town and hope that someone invites you to dinner and a movie ? recreate your parents ' courtship ? no. because it 's 2013 , and traditional dating as we know it is dead			1
when i traveled across the @entity35 a few years ago , i interviewed more than 100 men , women and couples about their love lives in cities big and small			1
my mission was to figure out what connection , romance and love actually looks like in today 's day and age			1
what i found was that we 're living in a post-dating world			0
the lost art of offline dating the happy couples i talked to had not met and immediately started dating			1
instead , they connected in more natural -- and yes , ambiguous -- settings			1
they played on the same volleyball team or were co-workers on a political campaign			0
or they hung out in the same social group or were friends for years before getting intimately involved or got intimately involved right off the bat with no initial relationship plans			0
or they met each other while living in different parts of the country and got to know each other via @entity15 or @entity69 before committing to full - on romances			1
instead of going on explicit dates , they had tested the romantic waters , moved in and out of gray areas , and used technology to explore the various aspects of their connection before putting labels or expectations on their relationship			0
this romantic ambiguity was also reflected in my conversations with people who were single			2
asked to define their romantic status , they gave me answers like , " well , it 's sort of up in the air ... " and " it 's really complicated ! how much time do you have ? " and " i would define it as , hmm , dating ? @entity94 ? dating - ish ? " online dating and a formula for love single people were n't dating , and young couples who had fallen in love had n't gotten to that point through dating			1
yes , there were men and women who bemoaned the death of dating			2
they yearned for the straightforward clarity of an earlier era where gender roles were obvious and technology did n't play such a central role			1
then they would n't have to deal with the ambiguity of e-mails or the unclear signals of text messages			0
they would n't have to overanalyze every word and interaction			0
at the same time , though , even those people were ready to admit that going on actual " dates " was full of pressure and not very enjoyable			1
traditional dating , they pointed out , encouraged an overly formal , inauthentic vibe that ultimately hindered instead of helped their efforts to make romantic connections			1
this was perfectly expressed to me by a 29 - year - old female personal trainer in @entity132 who had experimented with online dating , matchmakers and blind dates			2
" it 's hard to tell anything on the first date -- you 're so on the surface , " she explained			2
" i think expectations make things more difficult			0
they make it so much harder to pick someone , because you feel like the stakes are higher			2
... you miss that spark			2
... whereas when you 're just ' hanging out , ' it 's easier			2
" @entity152 in training : young women dating even younger men if women struggled with the pressures of traditional dating , men hated them			1
as a 26 - year - old male graduate student in @entity163 lamented , " i feel this burden to have to do something eccentric or clever or unorthodox			0
i feel like i 'm fighting this almost impossible uphill battle to stand out			0
i have to show a girl a magic trick			0
" his thoughts on getting to know women through more natural means ? " the ambiguity is much more romantic and fun , " he said			0
" you have a crush on them much more easily			0
" and is n't that the whole point ? for courtship to be fun while love develops ? today 's romantic landscape is full of ambiguity , gray areas and a lack of guarantees about where any given connection might lead			1
so consider this @entity1 an opportunity to set aside your outdated expectations and embrace a new mindset			0
instead , welcome this new era and see every encounter as a potential moment for romantic sparks and excitement			0
