@entity0 was blitzed with questions thursday about his presidential ambitions in a private session with top @entity5 donors and business leaders , multiple sources at the meeting told @entity9			1
@entity0 was politely non-committal , as he is in public , but said he was seriously considering the possibility and would make a decision after the holiday season			1
@entity0 , brother to one former president and son of another , was also pressed on whether he thought his last name would be a liability in a national campaign			1
the former @entity20 governor responded that " he quit worrying about that a long time ago , " according to two people in the room			2
" he said that everybody has things about them that are positives and negatives , but he said he loves his brother and loves his father , and that every campaign is about telling people who you are , " said one source			2
" he said that my last name is the same , but i am not them			2
that my job is to show people who i am as a policy maker and a man , and that 's the same job everyone else has			0
" the former @entity20 governor was in the state , which happens to hold the first presidential primary in the south , for a round of campaigning with @entity5 gov. @entity44 , who is expected to win re-election next month			1
@entity0 has traveled the country raising money for @entity49 candidates this cycle , but the @entity5 visit marked his first trek to an early primary state as questions about his national ambitions build			1
following crowded public events in @entity57 and @entity58 , @entity0 headlined a fundraiser for @entity44 in @entity60 that included a high - dollar roundtable with about 30 of the state 's top business leaders and @entity49 officials including @entity65 , the president of @entity67 @entity5 , @entity68 , head of the @entity5 @entity70 , and former state attorney general @entity71			1
in the roundtable — where price of entry was $ 10,000 — republicans exchanged pleasantries with @entity0 about his family before diving into questions about his political future			1
" this was n't a politically agnostic business crowd , " said one person in the room who did not want to be identified			2
" they dialed right in and wanted to get into politics , the horse race of 2016			2
" @entity0 , this person said , was " very engaging , but he was very non-committal about running			1
he said he has to have joy in his heart to do it			0
and he said he gets the question wherever he goes			0
" @entity94 , a @entity49 public affairs strategist in @entity60 , said the response to @entity0 from the donor crowd was " unbelievable			1
" " he said that if i am going to run , i would run because i have a positive vision to take the country forward and unify people and do something that the other people in the race are not talking about , " @entity94 said			2
" he had that positive @entity104 vision of creating a majority that transcends parties and races and brings people together			0
i 'll tell you what , he makes it very easy to be for him			0
" at one point , @entity0 expressed annoyance with the polarizing fights and constant negativity of the political news media — he later said his media diet includes @entity119 in the morning , followed by @entity120 on @entity121 — and said he is " frustrated " by the toxic climate in @entity123			1
republicans , though , need to do more than just criticize president @entity125 , he added			0
​ " he said , ' it 's easy to criticize			0
i turn on the news			0
but that ca n't be the only reason that people elect you , that you 're not the other guy , " one source at the fundraiser recalled			0
" the next @entity49 has to run about their ideas and what they will do			2
i get the temptation but that ca n't be the only reason that people elect you is that you 're not the other guy			0
" @entity0 told the donors he admires the restraint of his brother , former president @entity144 , for not criticizing @entity125 even as the security situation in @entity146 deteriorates			1
" he talked about how proud he was of his brother , " said one @entity49 donor			0
" he said , i could n't do it , but what a class act that he knows it 's not his place to come out and publicly criticize the sitting president			0
he said it 's tearing his brother up			0
