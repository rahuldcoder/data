@entity1 , @entity2 it 's 4 o'clock in the morning			1
most of @entity1 , the second most populated city in @entity2 , is fast asleep			1
but like a thief in the dead of night , a solitary figure slips through the city 's deserted streets			1
arriving at a derelict warehouse , he is brandishing what looks like a lightsaber as he makes his way to the roof			1
using the resting metropolis as a backdrop , " @entity21 " draws swift shapes in the air with the light wand			1
thirty seconds later , the camera shutter clicks and the light artist grabs his kit , disappearing once more into the night			1
welcome to the elusive , magical world of " lightbombing			1
" " @entity21 " is the street artist alter ego of 40 - year - old photographer @entity29 , who has been capturing the urban landscape of @entity1 streets since shortly after relocating there in 2000			1
much of the city had become ex-industrial space and @entity35 recalls how upon first appearances , the city seemed somewhat run down			1
but a chance late - night shoot revealed the transformative nature of nightfall on the city			1
what were once dead spaces became a textural stage for the photographer to illuminate			2
meeting in the heart of the city 's creative quarter , @entity35 greets me warmly before grabbing a coffee and sitting down			1
dressed casually in a sweatshirt , jeans and sneakers , his face lights up with enthusiasm as he begins to explain the art of lightbombing			2
" i look like a complete nutter " @entity60 is long - exposure photography where the artist draws intricate designs , patterns or words using hand - held lights in front of a camera in pitch black darkness			1
while many artists around the world experiment with long - exposure photography and light art , @entity35 coined the term " lightbombing			1
" " it 's me , the drunks and the burglars , " he says grinning			2
" to the average casual observer who just happens to come across me , i look like a complete nutter			2
i 'm in the street waving a torch around			1
it 's so dark you ca n't see my camera 90 % of the time			2
and you 're looking at this dude running around , thinking ' what the hell is going on ? ! ' " his technique borrows elements from graffiti , including " bombing , " where the artist gets to a location , does the work and is gone			1
@entity21 's physical process lasts mere seconds and leaves a continuous , fluctuating stroke on the final photograph as if by magic			2
. " it 's like drawing on the page and when i move the light in front of a camera , it leaves that mark			1
if you go faster , it leaves a thinner mark and if you go slower , it leaves a brighter mark , " explains the artist			1
then for just a brief moment , @entity35 's face becomes solemn			1
although striking and entertaining to see , lightbombing is n't some frivolous hobby			2
explaining his vocation , @entity35 's voice is filled with passion for his work as he reiterates that what you see is what he shoots			1
he 's adamant that the camera should capture the moment and only permits himself to edit the photographs in as much as a darkroom would allow			1
" i never edit my photos			2
you should shoot it for real , " he says			2
" when i grew up with film , you had to make it in the camera			2
there was no messing around			2
you could n't do much afterwards in post edit			2
yet some of the most iconic imagery of all - time was shot on film and very little touches with a brush afterwards on the print			1
i think there is something important about that			2
" he adds : " i very purposefully do n't shoot under direct light			1
i do n't hang around			2
i do n't wear bright clothing			2
i wish i wore some crazy ninja @entity151 suit or something			2
" " i 'm not going to get arrested " often he will spend weeks scouting the perfect location for his latest collection			2
and while he 's always eager to find a new space , he says he has no desire to be arrested			2
" as long as i do n't break anything to get in , i 'm not forcing entry			1
if there is a fence down , there 's a fence down			0
i 'm just wandering around			0
by and large , it is never my intention to trespass			0
i 'm walking around and if there is a way into a space , i might use it			0
" the popularity of @entity35 's light art has offered the photographer some exciting opportunities in the last few years , including working with commercial partners such as @entity176 for ad campaigns and traveling to @entity178 for a three - week collaboration with local artists			1
he has also shot scenes in the @entity183 countryside and during the @entity185 annual music festival			0
using the city as his playground , he never returns to the same location twice -- explaining that he thinks it helps keep his work " fresh			0
" but just for once , tonight he has driven me to an abandoned car park he recently shot at			0
as he expertly unfurls his tripod and snaps his camera in to place , @entity35 claims anyone can duplicate his method -- all you need is a light source and a camera			1
" the first few i did were with road safety maintenance lights that you have in your car			0
you can use anything , you could use your phone			0
you can use anything that has got a light			1
i use certain items -- i 'm not a painter but they are my brushes and also my sculptor 's tools as well			0
different ones do different things			0
different filters go onto them and to help me realize what i need that light form to do			1
" after a few test shots to check the light and angles of the moonlit rooftop , he turns on a meter - long light bar with what looks like purple transparency paper taped to one side and begins moving in front of the camera			1
" i 'm working out which strokes to make and where to put them in order to achieve what i want to do			0
so again there 's little nuances			0
the perspectives of what you expect it to be are out ( of sync ) , " he says			0
" by using angles and basically taking maximum advantage of the camera and tools at hand to shift the perspectives , i think that 's when you start to take it away from being real			0
it takes ( the light sculpture ) into a sort of wonderful , mystical element			1
" blink and you 'll miss it and how long does it take for @entity35 to create these dazzling light sculptures ? rather nonchalantly he replies : " about six minutes			1
in , out , shoot			0
get back in the car			0
" as he comes back to the camera to check each shot , @entity35 describes how it is quite meditative to work late into the night and how he often falls into a zen - like state while designing his pieces			1
but while he waxes lyrical about the metamorphic beauty of a deserted city , he 's also quick to remind me of the ever - present danger			1
" you 're on your own from a safety perspective and it is an expensive camera bag that i 'd quite like to keep hold of			0
it can lead to some hairy moments			0
i 'm pretty much fast enough to get gone			0
i try to shoot , wherever possible , near to my car			0
" most of the time , when anyone even vaguely sketchy gets close enough , you show them what you 're doing and they are so blown away by it that you diffuse the situation			0
" while he is open to sharing his techniques with the world , this masterful manipulator of light rarely features himself in his work preferring to let the photographs speak for themselves			1
" i just want to inspire people with my work			0
if someone can look at a piece and be excited , inspired , moved in any way shape or form , then i 'm happy , job done			0
because there is not enough of that in life			0
and there 's too much ' art. ' " this is why i strip away the ' arty ' stuff			0
it 's there and i could sit and wax about it but no one wants to hear that really			0
everyone can get something different from it			0
it keeps it accessible to people			0
" despite the near freezing temperatures out on city streets tonight , hours fly by as we move from location to location			0
finally , after one last shot , @entity35 makes his way back to the camera , glances at the screen and concludes he 's ready to call it a night			1
as he flips his tripod and pushes the legs back into the locked position , i ask him where he wants to take the moving art form next			0
" a lot of my work is very abstract , " he says			0
" a lot of my work has that magical element that wondrous thing , but sometimes there is not enough tangibility to it			0
the @entity176 campaign was a starting point			0
but i 'd like to up the game , essentially high - end fashion			1
do beautiful work with more people in them			0
i love the abstract work but for my heart ( @entity343 ) need to shoot with people			0
