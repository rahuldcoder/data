-- @entity1 has a simple philosophy which has served him well during his glittering career as one of the leading jockeys in the world of thoroughbred racing			1
" i just want to win and make my horses go as fast as they can for as long as they can , " he told @entity0 's @entity8			0
the 43 - year - old @entity11 can mount to an ever - growing list of @entity14 triumphs as proof of his success in the saddle , but is now also saddling up winners in his dual career as a trainer			1
@entity1 was granted his license earlier this year and has a string of horses in a stables at the home of @entity11 racing in the @entity28 , which he owns			1
during his short training career , @entity1 has already turned out a steady flow of winners and given his pedigree it is hardly surprising he has set his sights very high			1
" my training ambitions are big , " he said			0
" i start off and look at my horses and think all of my horses are @entity14 horses			0
" former jockey @entity38 also operates out of the stables , training the horses of influential owner @entity41 , a rich businessman who has invested heavily in @entity11 and @entity42 racing			1
the stables had their first @entity14 success in the @entity45 last year and others are predicted to challenge the likes of the @entity49 operation of all - conquering trainer @entity50			2
@entity1 was surprisingly dropped as retained jockey to owner the @entity52 -- he described it as a " horrible moment " -- amid reports that the decision centered on the jockey 's close relationship with a rival stables			1
in a prestigious race at the @entity28 last year , @entity38 's @entity60 beat the @entity63 - trained @entity62 for the @entity52			2
three days later came news of the parting of the ways			0
but @entity1 has continued to ride winners , finishing as leading jockey at this year 's @entity69 , with his latest success at top level coming on @entity73 challenger @entity72 at the @entity74			1
it was @entity1 's sixth victory in the prestigious race and underlined again his dual life is not hampering his abilities			2
" it 's usually when you retire you pack up your bags and start training , but i 'm still riding well , " he said			0
@entity1 has had three wins in the @entity85 with @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88			1
he doubled up with @entity86 in 2000 to take the @entity89 , @entity91 's most prestigious race			2
he believes his intimate knowledge of riding the best horses in the world give him a unique insight as a trainer			0
" you ca n't beat sitting on them yourself to get the feel of them and to see what suits them best			0
" but he admits that gaining his training license has made him appreciate his horses even more			0
" when i was just a jockey i always thought i liked horses , but i can now see why trainers love their horses , they are part of your family and you just want to do the best for them			0
" @entity1 told @entity0 that training was a " real eye opener " and clearly believes he has plenty to learn , but having worked as a jockey for masters of the craft like @entity50 and @entity63 , will surely learn the ropes quickly in his new training career .			2
