-- a new program that allows @entity3 fliers to avoid pre-flight pat - downs by submitting to one - off security vetting is proving successful , and is set to expand , says the @entity3 @entity6 ( @entity6 )			1
the scheme , known as " @entity8 , " allows pre-approved passengers to pass through airport security much the same way they would have done prior to september 11 , 2001			1
the green - lighted travelers pass through a different lane for security screening , without being made to take off their shoes or jackets , or remove their laptop and bags of liquid from their luggage			1
@entity6 spokesman @entity21 said more than 540,000 people had used @entity8 since it was introduced in four @entity3 airports late last year			1
it has since been rolled out to seven more , and will be available in 35 airports by the end of the year			0
while it is currently only available on @entity29 or @entity30 flights , it will soon be expanded to include @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			0
" it 's helping us to move away from a one - size - fits - all approach to security , with a goal of providing the most effective security in the most efficient way possible , " said @entity21			2

" we want to be able to focus on passengers we know less about , " @entity21 said			0
passengers in @entity53 are passing through airports much more quickly , and the scheme may also reduce the costs of security screening as it expanded , he added			1
there are currently two ways into the program , which is only open to @entity3 citizens			2
frequent fliers who meet certain security criteria -- which @entity6 would not disclose " for security reasons " -- may be invited by their airlines to join at no charge , provided they pass certain background checks			1
but @entity3 citizens can also join by applying for the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) global entry program -- a " trusted traveler " scheme in which individuals sign up to be vetted in order to expedite the customs process on arrival into the country from abroad			1
@entity81 , @entity72 's executive director for admissibility and passenger programs , said applicants for @entity71 paid a $ 100 fee and were accepted into the program for five years if they passed the security vetting			0
@entity72 assesses their residence and employment histories , as well as any criminal record or national - security concerns , before interviewing the applicant and taking fingerprints			1
" they 're disqualified if there 's any derogatory information , " he said			0

" we 've seen overwhelming support for this , " said @entity81			0
@entity21 said the more pragmatic approach to security screening was also reflected in new approaches to young and elderly passengers			1
new protocols towards passengers aged 12 and under have been put in place that will reduce the number of pat - downs and allow them to keep their shoes on as they pass through security			2
a pilot program was in place in four airports trialling similar measures for those aged 75 and over , he said			0
@entity8 passengers who displayed suspicious behavior would still be subjected to full security checks			2
@entity130 , executive director of airline consumer group @entity131 , said she welcomed the @entity8 scheme and urged it to be expanded to " create a very large list of low - risk travelers that can move quickly through security			1
" " we 're thrilled			0
but it 's sort of a ' what took you so long ? ' " she said			0
" we believe it should be expanded to every airport in the nation and they should stop treating every airline passenger as if they are terrorists			0
" the $ 100 fee to apply to use @entity8 through the @entity71 pathway was not a concern , she said			0
" as someone who travels very frequently , $ 100 for the speed with which you can move through security and retain your dignity is a small price to pay			0

@entity8 scheme gives some @entity3 flyers fast track through airport security
*eligible* travelers submit to one - off security screening ahead of time , avoiding standing in line
more than half a million people have already used the scheme , says @entity6
