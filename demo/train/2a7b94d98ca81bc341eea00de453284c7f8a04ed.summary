@entity0 -- the @entity2 has invoked executive privilege to keep president @entity5 's top political adviser , @entity4 , from having to testify thursday about the firings of at least eight @entity8 attorneys			1
the @entity2 invoked executive privilege to keep @entity4 from having to testify thursday			1
@entity4 , " as an immediate adviser to the president , " ca n't be ordered to testify and has been told not to appear , white house counsel @entity10 told the @entity12			2
the committee called @entity4 and his deputy , @entity14 , to testify thursday morning			2
the @entity2 says it is trying to protect the president 's ability to receive candid advice and offered to let top aides discuss the firings only if they were not placed under oath and no transcript was taken			1
" it is regretted that the committee has forced this action , as the president 's offer of accommodation to you and to the @entity28 could have provided information being sought in a manner respectful of presidential prerogatives and consistent with a spirit of comity , " @entity10 wrote			1
but sen. @entity34 , @entity35 , accused the @entity2 of trying to cover up @entity4 's role in the firings			1
he questioned why @entity4 discussed the matter publicly when the issue first made news , but now " is suddenly unable to talk it about when he is under oath			2
" " mr. @entity4 has given reasons for the firings that have now been shown to be inaccurate , after - the - fact fabrications , " @entity34 said in a statement issued wednesday evening			2
" yet he now refuses to tell this committee the truth about his role in targeting well - respected @entity8 attorneys for firing and in seeking to cover up his role and that of his staff in the scandal			0
" @entity57 , a lawyer for @entity14 , told @entity1 his client will appear before the @entity28 but would refuse to answer questions he feels are covered by executive privilege			1
former @entity2 political director @entity61 testified under similar circumstances in july			0
the @entity2 already has invoked executive privilege to block previous testimony by @entity61 and former white house counsel @entity65 , who skipped a hearing in the @entity2 two weeks ago , and to keep chief of staff @entity68 from turning over documents subpoenaed as part of the inquiry			1
the panel voted to cite @entity65 and @entity68 for contempt of @entity74 for failing to comply with subpoenas			0
the decision on whether to pursue any action on those citations lies with the @entity79			0
the privilege claim can be challenged in court			0
but sen. @entity82 of @entity83 , the ranking @entity84 on the @entity28 , has said the courts would be unlikely to resolve any challenge before @entity5 leaves office			0
vice president @entity88 dismissed the congressional investigation of the attorney firings as a " witch hunt " during a @entity1 interview tuesday			1
@entity94 congressional leaders , however , say administration officials have been unable to answer their most basic questions -- who compiled the list of prosecutors to be dismissed , and why were they selected ? while the @entity5 administration has maintained that the prosecutors ' firings were handled properly , the controversy has led to the resignations of at least three top @entity79 officials and triggered widespread criticism of attorney general @entity107 , who repeatedly told a @entity12 committee in april that he did not recall details of the firings			0
critics say the attorneys were forced out for political reasons , such as for failing to bring voter fraud cases pushed by @entity84 activists , and administration officials have acknowledged that one was fired to allow a @entity4 protege to take a post in @entity120			0
