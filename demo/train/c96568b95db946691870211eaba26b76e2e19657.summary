" in particular , it is relevant to the defense that @entity4 possessed both propofol and @entity43 in his residence as early as 2003 , " the defense said in a motion filed monday			2
@entity0 deputy district attorney @entity45 argued testimony about drugs @entity4 possessed in 2003 " has absolutely nothing to do with the standard of medical care " @entity7 gave @entity4 the day he died on june 25 , 2009			1
bringing up anything about the molestation trial , which ended with @entity4 's acquittal , would be " character assassination on the victim , " @entity45 said			2

" pastor ruled that @entity89 dermatologist dr. @entity88 could not be called to testify about giving @entity43 shots			0
testimony about @entity4 's visits to @entity88 's office in the days before his death could lead the jury " down the path of prescribing to dr. @entity88 some sort of criminal culpability in the death of mr. @entity4			2
" however , @entity88 's medical records can be used in the trial , he ruled			0
two of @entity88 's office employees also can not be called as witnesses , he ruled			0
