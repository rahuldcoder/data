-- have you ever looked at your boss and wondered " who promoted you ? " or " how have you not been fired by now ? " if you have , take comfort in knowing you 're not alone -- many of us have to deal with bosses that seem in over their heads			1
the fact is , that while your inept boss may drive you nuts , it may not even be his or her fault -- or even the fault of your company for promoting your boss in the first place			1
your unsuspecting employer had no idea that your boss would become a full - blown case of the @entity21 in action			1
so who is @entity21 and what did he do to make your boss so frustrating , you ask ? well , @entity21 is a former professor who published a satirical book based around his theory that " in a hierarchy , every employee tends to rise to his level of incompetence " and that " in time , every post tends to be occupied by an employee who is incompetent to carry out its duties			1
" or , basically : we do a job well , we 're promoted			1
we do that job well , we 're promoted again			1
this happens in succession until we eventually rise to a position that we can no longer do well -- or our level of incompetence			1
there , we either stagnate , revert back to a lower position , or are fired			2
while " the @entity21 : why things always go wrong , " was originally meant to provide a sort of absurd - yet - true comic relief to the over-worked , the practicality and pertinence of the @entity21 was not lost on the working world , and the theory has since become a hotly debated human resources phenomenon			1
below three experts argue their side of the @entity21			1
@entity0 : conflicting career advice : which is right " it 's true ! " -- @entity59 , professional speaker and author of " @entity61 : the textbook to a @entity63 " " i live in a city where one of the department heads ( and the highest paid civic employee in the city ) is the most incompetent person you 'd ever want to meet			1
ever since he [ took the job ] it has been one disaster after another			1
he 'll hire someone to do a job for the city , and when they too prove to be incompetent , he hires someone else to cover his tracks saying that the last company was n't a good fit			1
this incompetence has cost the city millions of dollars , and yet he has the council members , the mayor and city manager bamboozled , so they do n't fire him			2
[ as a business consultant ] , the minute i find the people who are living examples of the @entity21 is the minute i find the problems in the company			1
this problem is so diverse and prevalent i have even seen examples of the founder of the company being a leading example of the @entity21			1
i know that sounds crazy , but they had two things going for them : an idea that was just too good to fail , and the ability to hire very competent people to make it all work			1
i have even , as crazy as this sounds , found people who are running or trying to start one - man shops			1
in this day and age of entrepreneurship , everyone believes they can start a business and make it succeed because they ' have the best idea that will make them overnight millionaires			2
' wrong ! it 's hard to look into someone 's eyes and tell them they are too incompetent to do what they have set out to do , even if they have been doing something similar in another place , where they had actually reached the level of incompetence espoused by @entity21			1
a lot people believe the @entity21 applies to just business , but there are an awful lot of people out there who live it in all areas of their life			1
they are incompetent at life itself			2
we have all met people like this and we always wonder how they even exist			2
" @entity0 : how to self - promote without being obnoxious " it 's false ! " -- @entity148 , co-owner , @entity149 " i personally do not believe in the @entity21			1
the field of neurolinguistic programming says that any behavior / skill can be learned			2
in other words , if a person does not already know how to do something , he / she can be taught			0
sometimes , however , we have internal barriers to learning and achievement that keep us from growing intellectually and professionally			0
limiting beliefs , such as ' i 'm not smart enough ' or ' i 'm not good at math , ' can keep people from attempting more complex challenges			2
this is not an issue of incompetence			0
it is an issue of limiting beliefs -- or an ' emotional intelligence ' gap			0
stagnation , reverting to a lower position or being fired can result from a variety of ' emotional intelligence ' gaps			0
for example , some people have not adequately learned to read body language cues			2
they may press their point , even though it is clear listeners are becoming angry or defensive			0
they may bark orders at colleagues , unaware that listeners are bristling			0
they do n't adjust their communication to preserve rapport			0
one might argue that this is a form of incompetence			0
however , the @entity21 seems to suggest that each person has a level of competence that he / she can not move beyond			1
i strongly disagree with this presupposition			0
even the most bull - in - a - china - shop communicator can learn techniques for building rapport , resolving conflict gracefully , etc. the issue is : is a person able to acknowledge their deficits and seek help			0
in some cases , employees are in such denial that they do remain stuck or they get fired ... until they finally ' get ' the message			0
there is an older book , ' battling the @entity213 , ' that offers an interesting concept -- ' controlled trauma to induce transformation ' and offers this illustration : ' @entity218 ... can be thought of as an example of controlled trauma that is designed to foster traits like loyalty and obedience			0
' sometimes , an employer can stage a controlled trauma to help an employee move beyond a stuck place or overcome denial			0
for example , let 's say a star salesperson is running roughshod over co-workers by communicating curtly , expecting them to stay until midnight to finish tasks that could wait until the next day , etc. an employer could pull the person aside and say , ' we appreciate your sales talent and all the business you have brought to our company			0
however , we are receiving numerous complaints from your colleagues about your communication style			0
we value you and want you to continue here			0
but this bullying communication style can not continue			0
we will pay for a coach to work with you on this if you would like to stay with our company			2
otherwise , you will need to find employment elsewhere			0
' if the salesperson accepts the coaching , he / she has an opportunity to move to a new level in his / her career			0
in contrast , the @entity21 suggests this salesperson would hit a career ceiling			1
" @entity0 : a field guide to co-workers " it depends ! " -- @entity262 , @entity263 , author of " wander woman : how @entity265 " " i have been a corporate trainer for 30 years			0
i do n't believe you can really measure the truth of the @entity21 without analyzing the training the person has had for the position they have moved into , especially if it 's a promotion			1
with each promotion the person has to give up some of the things they have done before and take on new tasks , responsibilities and perspectives ( including work values )			2
what they did before will not ensure their success in the present			0
however , if the person does n't get good mentoring , training and a manager who can support the shift , they are not given the tools to succeed			2
they could be competent if given the chance			2

the @entity21 states that people work their way up at work until they no longer do well
it is difficult to tell a boss or *coworker* that they are not competent enough for their job
some believe an incompetent boss might not have received adequate training
