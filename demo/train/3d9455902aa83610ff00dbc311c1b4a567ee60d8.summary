the sights at the @entity2 zoo could n't be sadder			1
in a tiny cage , a baboon sits , picking seeds off the floor , desperately eating whatever he can find			2
next to the baboon , the carcass of his mate and five offspring lay in the pen , decomposing in the august heat			0
" eight to 10 monkeys were killed , " says @entity16 , the zoo 's chief veterinarian			1
" also a peacock , a gazelle , a lion , and a fox			0
" the carcasses of dead animals , mostly monkeys , lay scattered across the scorched grass between the pens			2
in one of the cages , a dead peacock lays in front of two hungry lions			0
in another , a crocodile lounges in the hot sun ; there is almost no water in the enclosure , which also holds a pelican and a duck			2
the zoo , part of the @entity44 recreational park in @entity45 , northern @entity2 , was hit multiple times during the recent conflict between @entity48 and @entity50 militants			1
many of the animals seem weak and traumatized			2
staff members say that on top of the injuries some of the animals sustained during the violence , many also have not eaten in days because the zoo lacks funds to buy food , and they 're getting virtually no assistance			1
" the situation is very bad , " said @entity16			0
" we ca n't get the animals out to clean the cages			2
many of them are getting sick because they are weak and it is dirty			0
but we do n't have any alternative places			0
" the situation is most dire for the lions , according to @entity16			0
one was killed during the conflict and three remain in the zoo			1
@entity16 says he does not have the funds to buy them the meat they need			0
" they have not eaten for 10 to 15 days , " he said			0
" we could not reach them during the fighting			0
when it got calmer at least we could bring them some water			2
" to help , at least a little , the @entity88 crew bought six chickens at the local market for the zoo 's staff to feed to the lions			1
it was clear to see how hungry the lions were			0
they ran toward the edge of the cage and began roaring the moment they saw us approaching with the dead chickens			0
once we handed them over , they would take turns -- one lion would eat while the other kept an eye on us			2
when we got too close to the cage , the lions would charge and roar again , warning us to back off			0
@entity110 is run by @entity50 , the @entity111 militant group that governs @entity2 and is considered a terrorist organization by the @entity113 , the @entity114 and @entity48			1
built in 2008 , it was supposed to be a tourist attraction for @entity117			0
it includes a soccer field , an amusement park with carousels , and several buildings , most of which were flattened by airstrikes during the recent conflict			1
an @entity48 military spokesman told @entity88 that there is an investigation under way into allegations the zoo had been hit by airstrikes , and said he could not go into more detail due to legal reasons			1
but @entity88 understands from @entity48 sources that the military believes there may have been a number of @entity50 rocket launchers in the area of the zoo , and that the zoo might have suffered collateral damage in strikes targeting those rocket launchers			1
@entity50 says the park is in a civilian area , but our crew did see several charred and mangled metal cases that looked like destroyed rocket batteries			1
the zoo staff says its main task for now is saving the lives of the animals			1
" the first step has to be providing food , " says vet @entity16			2
" then we must rebuild the place and make it suitable for them to live in again			0
" but with more than 2,000 people killed and many homes destroyed in the recent fighting , most people in @entity2 and the international community have more pressing problems than the plight of zoo animals			1
in the meantime , the lions , crocodiles , monkeys and birds who survived the hostilities at the zoo now face the danger of succumbing to hunger and disease in the aftermath of this man - made war .			1
