@entity0 -- the @entity2 offered unanimous support for police wednesday by allowing drug evidence gathered after an arrest that violated state law to be used at trial , an important search - and - seizure case turning on the constitutional limits of " probable cause			1
" the @entity2 unanimously gave police broader powers to search for and seize evidence			2
" when officers have probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime in their presence , the @entity16 permits them to make an arrest , and to search the suspect in order to safeguard evidence and ensure their own safety , " justice @entity15 wrote			1
@entity28 was stopped by @entity29 , @entity30 , officers five years ago for driving his vehicle on a suspended license			1
under state law in such incidents , only a summons is to be issued and the motorist is to be allowed to go			0
instead , detectives detained @entity28 for almost an hour , arrested him , then searched him and found cocaine			0
at trial , @entity28 's lawyers tried to suppress the evidence , but the state judge allowed it , even though the court noted the arrest violated state law			1
a police detective , asked why the man was arrested , replied , " just our prerogative			0
" while some of the justices expressed concern about that level of discretion at oral arguments in january , their 9 - 0 ruling raised few such doubts			0
" the arrest rules that the officers violated were those of state law alone , " @entity15 said			1
" it is not the province of the @entity16 to enforce state law			0
" the state had argued an arrest is constitutionally reasonable if officers have probable cause to believe a suspect has committed a crime			2
" this standard represents the best compromise between the needs of the citizens and the duty of the government to combat crime , " @entity71 , @entity30 's deputy solicitor general , had told the high court			0
but @entity28 's attorney , @entity80 , called an " extreme proposition " the idea that it would be reasonable " to go out and arrest someone for a non-arrestable offense and not only do that , but having committed that trespass at common law , to further search them			2
" there has been widespread judicial confusion over how such police searches should be handled			0
some lower courts had ruled that when state arrest law is violated , the @entity94 provides a remedy in the suppression of any evidence resulting from the arrest and a related search			1
but the justices agreed with the majority of courts that said constitutional requirements are satisfied when an officer has probable cause to make an arrest , even if some provision of state law was violated in the process			1
justice @entity110 wrote a concurring opinion suggesting @entity30 change its law to make driving on a suspended license an arrestable offense			1
during arguments , @entity110 spoke for several colleagues when she pointed out that if a summons had been issued in @entity28 's case , any incriminating evidence would have been excluded			0
" would you explain the logic to saying that when the police violate state law , then the evidence can come in , but when they comply with state law , it ca n't , " she asked			2
the ruling means @entity28 's original jury conviction and 3 - Â½ year prison term will stand			0

case involves @entity30 man stopped for driving with suspended license
instead of issuing ticket , police detained him and searched his *car*
arrest violated state 's law , but trial judge allowed evidence of drugs
justices ruled that officers had probable cause for search
