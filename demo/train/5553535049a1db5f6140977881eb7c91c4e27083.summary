@entity0 -- as president @entity5 announced the first national @entity7 strategy earlier this week , outside the gates of the @entity4 , 3 percent of the @entity0 's population continues to live with the disease			1
hiv / aids rates in the district are " on par with @entity12 and some parts of @entity14 " where the disease has raged for years , says @entity16 , @entity0 's former hiv / aids administration director			1
three percent of @entity18 live with hiv / aids , according to a study released by the district in 2009			1
the accepted threshold for a " generalized and severe epidemic , " according to the study , is 1 percent			1
flanked by national health care administrators and community activists , @entity5 said his national strategy is to increase prevention and improve treatment while reducing disparities among groups hardest - hit by the disease			1
in @entity0 , that 's the @entity34 - @entity33 community , according to activists			1
" in @entity0 there 's a huge disparity through race			1
the @entity34 - @entity33 community bears a huge burden of @entity7 in @entity0 -- way above and beyond the proportions of the demographics of the @entity0 area , " says @entity39 , who works with the @entity40 , a health center specializing in hiv / aids care			1
and it 's estimated that a third to half of @entity0 residents living with the disease do n't know it , @entity39 said			1
part of the problem is the stigma in the @entity34 - @entity33 community related to the disease , he said			1
@entity58 was 17 when he was infected with the virus that causes @entity7			1
now 28 , the gay @entity34 - @entity33 man has become an advocate within his community , speaking to groups whenever possible			1
but he believes the best way to reach his peers is through faith - based organizations , to stop the stigma related to testing and having the disease			2
" it 's a religious thing , mainly a lot of the churches do n't tend to back it [ hiv / aids testing and education ] and because they do n't back it and [ the church ] is the backbone of the black community , we find ourselves hiding behind doors			2
" " we do n't tend to take to homosexuality or hiv / aids very well , " @entity58 says			2
" it 's always a tendency to put the blame on someone else			0
... we tend to say it 's another person , they did n't tell us , they did n't let us know what was going on			2
it does stand true to this day			0
" it 's something @entity58 knows first - hand			2
" for me , it took a long time to get over the stigma , get out of the closet , to stop hiding behind my status			0
" @entity39 also believes faith - based initiatives would be helpful			0
his organization has worked to identify area churches where regular testing and counseling could occur			0
he says the effort has yielded some positive results			0
" i think in the last three or four years in this community , we slowed the freight train down and we now are looking to turn that freight train around			0
" both men are hopeful that more federal dollars might help			0
" money makes the world go round , " @entity58 said			0
but more important , they agree the money must be carefully targeted to the communities hardest hit			0
" federal dollars need to pour to those communities , to do education , to do outreach , to do testing campaigns , and to aggressively link those people to care			0
it really is to get people to medical care and to treatment , " @entity39 said			0
@entity5 told the crowd assembled at the @entity4 , " we 're here because we believe that while @entity7 transmission rates in this country are not as high as they once were , every new case is one case too many			1
" for @entity39 , who tested @entity7 positive 18 years ago , the daily battle to reduce infections is more than just a job			2
" i have a very personal stake in my career , " he says			0
" i sometimes say , i come to work to save myself every day			0
