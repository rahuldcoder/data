for that one great game that would single - handedly justify the purchase of the next - generation video game console			2
" @entity12 , " the first game from @entity10 , appears ready to assume the mantle			1
first revealed at @entity13 in @entity14 , " @entity12 " had already garnered more than 60 awards before its release last week			2
now , players are getting their first shot to play as the athletic pilots of monstrously large robotic titans , stomping across highly detailed terrain in a game even the makers of the @entity3 say could be one for the ages			1
" we think ( @entity12 ) can very much be a game - defining moment for @entity3 as a platform because of how much it has lit up the imagination of gamers everywhere and how it takes advantage of the unique features of @entity3 , " said @entity3 chief marketing and strategy officer @entity26			1
" i think people really are excited about it			0
it is why people spent hundreds of dollars to have the best game experience possible			2
" some of the creators of " @entity12 " have a pretty good idea what it is like to have that kind of pressure on a game			1
@entity10 founder and ceo @entity10 was also the ceo of @entity49 , which developed the hit , " @entity52 " series			2
@entity53 told @entity0 he is amazed about the level of excitement for his new game , and welcomes the expectations			2
" you put your heart into it			0
you want it to be the best thing ever and you want it to be universally accepted as well , " he said			0
" it blows us away -- the enthusiasm for the title			2
" asked if the expectations were too great for " @entity12 , " he said with a laugh , " if i say yes , it makes me look like i do n't have confidence in the game			1
if i say no , it feels like i 'm being arrogant			0
" @entity53 said " @entity12 " could n't have existed without the increased gaming power and features of the @entity3 console			1
he said @entity80 's cloud architecture allows designers to raise the visual and competitive level of the game without sacrificing other elements			1
" where we take advantage of it really is using @entity80 's back end to do things we could n't normally do in multiplayer games like putting all that @entity92 ( artificial intelligence ) and that extra flash in those cinematic moments , " he said			2
" we are able to do much more with the game			0
with @entity80 providing that to us , that 's money and resources that we really did n't have			2
" @entity80 's @entity26 said game developers were able to store a lot of the computing that " @entity12 " uses directly onto @entity80 servers			1
" that 's something unique that we 've done with these dedicated servers , " he said			0
" we 've spent a lot of money to back every @entity3 console with hundreds of thousands of servers to have great gameplay			1
" " @entity12 's " appeal lies in its ability to allow many people to play together in a rich environment with exciting gameplay , much like " @entity52 " did on the @entity117			1
@entity53 said the real adventure and fun begins when players realize how much freedom they have during the game			0
" it really is about that balance of gameplay where sometimes you are in a titan , sometimes you 're not			0
sometimes you want to be , sometimes you do n't			0
both sides ( pilot and titan ) are powerful and feel good and have a benefit in a different way , " he said			0
" it is n't just about getting to @entity135 and crushing everybody			0
it is a whole , very balanced pilot ballet , i guess			0
" early launch reaction was generally good , with servers for the @entity3 holding up well under the stress of the initial rush			1
pc users have had some issues with connection problems , but @entity10 is said to be working on those for a quick resolution			0
and it looks like the game itself is helping sell an entire system			0
sales of the @entity3 in @entity153 have nearly doubled since friday , when " @entity12 " was released there			1
" we have had a tradition of a big , multiplayer , epic game that defines each one of our console generations , " @entity26 said			0
" whether it was the original @entity3 with ' @entity162 , ' there has always been a great game to define the generation			1
' @entity12 ' is certainly going to be one of those for @entity3 , no question			1

" @entity12 " could be the defining game for @entity3
title is by " @entity52 " creators
@entity173 used @entity80 servers during its creation
early numbers show @entity179 sales spike along with " @entity12 "
