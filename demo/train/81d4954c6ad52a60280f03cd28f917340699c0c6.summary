the mystery congressman responsible for the inclusion of language in the $ 1.1 trillion dollar spending bill that caused a progressive outcry is coming forward to defend the provision			1
the measure weakens banking regulations designed to prevent another financial crisis			2
critics of the language , such as @entity11 sen. @entity10 , claim the provision could invite another fiscal meltdown and was essentially written by the @entity15 banking giant , @entity14			1
in a statement to @entity19 , rep. @entity16 , @entity17 , insisted the provision included in the spending bill would not lead to a collapse on @entity23 , followed by a bailout from taxpayers			1
" the amendment does not address the riskier derivatives associated with the mortgage crisis , " @entity16 said in the statement			0
" other backstops exist in @entity31 to prevent a bailout based on those instruments			0
" as the spending bill , dubbed the @entity36 by @entity38 insiders , was debated in @entity39 last week , @entity34 blasted the banking provision as a " loophole " that would allow @entity23 to gamble with taxpayer money			1
" this giveaway that was drafted by @entity14 lobbyists has no place in a critical government funding bill , " @entity34 said in a speech on the @entity45 floor that once again stirred speculation the @entity48 @entity47 may run for the presidency			0
a spokesman for @entity16 acknowledged the wording of the amendment essentially came from a stand - alone bill that passed the @entity58 last year			1
" we got the language from @entity62 , " a @entity16 aide told @entity19			2
that legislation , @entity62 , was partially written by lobbyists for @entity14 , according to emails obtained by @entity65			0
the bill , which was never voted on in the @entity45 , sought to loosen @entity31 regulations aimed at limiting banking and investment industry practices that led to the 2008 financial crisis			0
asked about the provision , @entity58 press secretary @entity71 said president @entity73 plans to sign the spending legislation to prevent a government shutdown			1
but @entity71 said the president remains opposed to @entity16 's language			2
" the @entity58 , regardless of who wrote the provision , strongly opposes it and does n't think it 's a good idea , because it does water down one element of @entity23 reform , " @entity71 told reporters tuesday			1
@entity71 said the @entity58 was " in the loop " in the drafting of the spending bill but could not account for every provision in the legislation			2
" this is a bill that was written by @entity39 , and whether one element of that bill was plagiarized by a member of @entity39 from a @entity96 lobbyist is something that you 'd have to ask a member of @entity39 , " @entity71 said			0
in his statement , @entity16 touted his provision as needed protection for smaller financial institutions , rather than a boon to @entity23			1
" without this fix , smaller regional banks would be in danger of not being able to meet the lending needs of their customers			0
ultimately , farmers , manufacturers and other @entity114 businesses would be harmed the most , " @entity16 added			0
@entity16 is perhaps best - known for skinny dipping in the @entity116 during a trip with other congressional leaders to @entity119 in 2011			0
the @entity121 @entity120 later apologized for the incident .			2
