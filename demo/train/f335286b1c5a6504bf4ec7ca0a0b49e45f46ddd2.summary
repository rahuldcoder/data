-- " where your treasure is , there is your heart also			0
" so goes one biblical quote that could be applied to the @entity7 ' intervention in @entity8			1
in a letter to the @entity11 secretary - general presented by @entity7 ambassador to the @entity11 @entity13 , the @entity7 justified airstrikes in @entity8 as an effort to protect @entity17 citizens from attacks by the @entity19 and other extremist groups			1
he did not , however , mention @entity8 citizens			2
it is this omission that goes to the heart of the @entity7 ' misplaced priorities			2
the numbers underscore the administration 's focus on degrading and ( one day ) defeating @entity19 , rather than on providing urgently needed humanitarian assistance to the victims of the organization 's barbarism			2
take , for example , the @entity35 's recent announcement that it will provide an additional almost $ 500 million in humanitarian aid to help those affected by the war in @entity8			1
according to the @entity35 , this brings the total amount of @entity7 humanitarian aid to $ 2.9 billion since march 2011 â € ” or about $ 700 million per year , $ 60 million a month or $ 14 million per week			1
but while this is a substantial amount , it will very quickly be surpassed by the costs of @entity7 military operations			2
indeed , only last month , @entity47 approved roughly $ 500 million to train moderate @entity8 rebels , the same amount set aside for additional humanitarian assistance			1
and this does n't even take account of airstrikes against @entity19 in @entity17 , which , according to a @entity55 spokesperson , have cost around $ 52 million a week			1
expanding the air war to @entity8 will substantially increase those expenditures , to as much as $ 100 million per week , according to some analysts			1
this would mean the cost of airstrikes would exceed our investment in humanitarian assistance in just five weeks			2
this is not meant as an argument against military action			0
but it does suggest that we are forgetting the reason we are undertaking it			0
the @entity11 high commissioner for refugees estimates there are more than 3 million @entity8 refugees and projects that number will rise to 4.1 million by the end of 2014			1
the @entity35 suggests the situation is even more dire			0
more than half of @entity8 's population has been driven from their homes and nearly 6.5 million have been displaced within @entity8			2
nearly 11 million are in need of aid within @entity8			1
if our justification for military intervention is to protect innocent @entity17 ( and presumably also @entity8 ) , then @entity7 humanitarian assistance should be at least equal to the costs of our military response			1
the @entity91 's regional response plan for 2014 catalogs the range of basic human needs of these millions of displaced persons : protection , including protection from sexual violence , shelter , food , health care , water , sanitation and hygiene			0
over the long term , the displaced will have to recover their livelihoods			0
children will need to resume their basic education to prevent a " lost generation " of @entity8 children			0
if the @entity7 is going eventually to " put boots on the ground , " providing these basic needs in both the near and long term should be the primary mission of the courageous @entity7 who deploy to the region			0
the suffering @entity19 -- and the regime of @entity8 president @entity118 -- are inflicting on @entity17 and @entity8 citizens might persist for years			1
if we do not get our priorities right now -- and properly make the case for rebalancing military and humanitarian expenditure in @entity8 -- then there is every reason to believe the much - needed cash for humanitarian assistance will dry up once the @entity7 declares victory over @entity19 and turns its attention elsewhere			1
that would compound an already horrific human tragedy			0
the @entity7 has been militarily engaged in @entity17 almost continually since the first @entity133 in 1991 , a span that might surprise many @entity7			0
if there is a lesson to be learned from this experience , therefore , it should be that blunt @entity7 military power can not stabilize the region , never mind secure peace			0
humanitarian assistance on a much larger scale , in contrast , could help ease the suffering of millions who are caught in the vortex of this sectarian conflict			0
that is where our hearts should be -- and our treasure also .			0
