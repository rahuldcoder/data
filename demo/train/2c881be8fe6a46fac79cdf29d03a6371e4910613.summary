@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 government said it would halt the construction of a controversial landfill near @entity6 , but the assurance was not enough for protesters who clashed with police saturday night , injuring six police officers			1
residents were protesting not only the building of a new landfill , but the conditions of an existing landfill , which they said pose an environmental and health hazard			2
@entity18 , the chief of @entity1 's civil protection agency , was named by the government to deal with the issue			1
he told reporters that the government would put the second landfill on hold and the current landfill will be analyzed for any dangers to people or natural resources			1
but protesters were wary of the government 's word , and continued their demonstration			1
some 500 protesters were blocking the road that leads to the landfill , though police estimated that only 20 or 30 people were involved in the clashes with police			1
some speculated that those involved were not even involved in the protest , but were hooligans looking to start trouble			0
protesters hurled rocks , firecrackers and @entity48 cocktails at police			2
@entity18 met sunday with the mayors of the towns in the landfill area in @entity6 to restate the governments position			1
but the mayors have not agreed to @entity18 's proposed compromise			0
another meeting has been scheduled for tuesday			0
" we are going to continue these battles and i believe that we 'll obtain what we want , " said @entity57 , mayor of @entity58			0
" i only ask my citizens to have faith in the local institutions			0
we 'll continue to battle to the end , but now i ask that these acts of vandalism stop because they do n't bring any thing good to any one			0
" another nearby mayor , @entity70 of @entity71 , said , " our citizens have asked for a bigger guarantee that a second landfill would not be open			2
it has not been possible to obtain that and therefore we do n't think we can sign the document			0
" despite the lack of agreement , @entity18 said the government will move forward unilaterally with its proposals			0
he also said that garbage in @entity6 , which has been piling up on streets , will be cleared within four days			2
