-- this week , @entity1 experienced their own version of " @entity4			1
" that was the day it was announced that @entity8 mayor @entity7 had been chosen to deliver the keynote speech at next month 's @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12			1
it marks the first time that a @entity15 has headlined the event , and it 's a huge story			2
i 've known @entity7 for about eight years , and consider him a close friend			2
we talk about politics , but since we both have 3 - year - old daughters , we also talk about fatherhood			0
we were on the phone tuesday night talking about what he intends to say in his convention speech when the news broke that @entity28 , a former @entity29 solicitor general , had just defeated @entity29 lt. gov. @entity30 in the @entity32 primary runoff for the @entity34 seat being vacated by @entity35			1
@entity28 will now go on to face a @entity10 opponent in the general election , which he is likely to win			2
this would make the @entity32 the first @entity15 senator from @entity29 , which makes for another huge story			1
i 've known @entity28 for about 10 years and consider him a friend , too			2
we 've been to dinner with our wives			0
he has a sharp mind and a good heart			0
@entity7 is a @entity48 , and @entity28 is a @entity32			1
and yet , these two @entity15 politicos from @entity29 have a lot in common			1
they 're both young -- @entity7 is 37 , @entity28 is 41			1
they both graduated from prestigious universities -- @entity7 from @entity53 , @entity28 from @entity54			1
they 're both well - spoken , well - connected and well - liked by non-latinos who share their politics			0
the real difference is how many @entity1 are reacting to these young men and their remarkable accomplishments			2
word of @entity7 's speech is being treated unequivocally as great news			1
and it is : he has been handed the golden ticket that was eight years ago given to @entity69			0
this is his chance to make @entity71 fall in love with him , draw scores of new contributors from around the country and position himself for the next rung on the political ladder			0
look for @entity7 to try to move up in 2014			0
the high - achiever may soon make more history by becoming the first @entity15 governor of @entity29			1
it is great news for the 52 million @entity1 in the @entity71 who will continue to grow their influence and be courted by both parties as long they do n't give in to either too easily			1
that has been a problem in the past			0
@entity1 are loyal consumers of detergents , soft drinks and the @entity90			2
many @entity91 - @entity71 -- who along with naturalized @entity91 , represent nearly 70 % of the @entity15 population -- would never think of voting for a @entity32			0
and the @entity93 does n't do much to win them over with its ham - handed approach to immigration			2
meanwhile , by putting the spotlight on @entity7 , @entity90 may have clinched the @entity15 vote for the next decade			1
this is great news for the @entity90 , even though when it comes to fixing the public schools , shoring up @entity103 or overhauling the immigration system , it tends to put its own narrow interests before the broader interests of its most loyal constituents			2
@entity90 take care of organized labor , senior citizen lobbies , teachers unions and anyone else who takes care of them			0
minorities and young people come last			0
@entity1 have given a majority of their votes to @entity10 candidates in the past 13 presidential elections , dating back to 1960			0
what took the @entity90 so long to allow a @entity15 to give the keynote address at their national convention ? republicans did it back in 1984 , when @entity71 treasurer @entity125 gave the keynote speech at the @entity127 in @entity128			1
this new gesture is appreciated , but it is also way overdue			0
as for @entity28 , his being endorsed and championed by the tea party makes many @entity1 uneasy and suspicious , particularly @entity133 in the @entity134			2
it 's causing angst as @entity1 try to figure out if @entity28 's victory is a giant step forward or an enormous leap backward			1
they wonder if he 'll identify at all with being @entity15 , or just fall in line behind sen. @entity142 of @entity143 and other rigid conservatives			0
in fact , in the initial round of media stories , @entity28 's victory was framed more as a triumph for the tea party than a breakthrough for @entity1			1
his opponent @entity30 had waged a nasty campaign that was borderline racist in suggesting that his @entity15 opponent was soft on illegal immigration , with no evidence to back that up other than @entity28 's @entity160 surname			1
he deserved to lose , and i 'm glad he did			0
it sent a message to other politicians not to waste their time engaging in this kind of ethnic demagoguery			0
besides , @entity1 are never going to get ahead politically in this country until they learn to split their votes between the parties to influence @entity93 and @entity90			1
@entity28 can help with that			0
it 's true that i criticized him a few months ago in a column for betraying his moderate roots and lurching to the right in his @entity176 is someone who served as @entity178 to @entity179 in the 2000 @entity179 - @entity181 campaign , and now he refers to comprehensive immigration reform -- one of @entity179 's signature causes -- as " amnesty ? " but now that @entity28 appears to be headed for @entity184 , i would n't be surprised if he distanced himself from the tea party the way that sen. @entity187 of @entity188 did after getting elected in 2010			2
in fact , i would expect @entity28 to team up with @entity187 in a kind of @entity192 - @entity71 dynamic duo that could steer important debates in the @entity34			0
how could that be bad for @entity1 ? beyond that , @entity28 's developing fortunes are more than just a powerful symbol			1
it 's a neon billboard that reminds @entity90 that they can do much better in terms of sharing power and expanding opportunity			2
why had n't the @entity201 broken this barrier years ago and elected a @entity15 @entity203 to the @entity34 , especially in light of the decades of support it has enjoyed from @entity15 voters ? @entity1 are living through a kind of political renaissance			1
they should enjoy the spotlight but also take advantage of it			0
these two political hotshots are just part of the story			0
now it 's up to @entity15 voters to make the most of their new influence and improve the lives of a community that has been poorly served by both parties -- and deserves much better			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			0

@entity224 : two @entity15 politicians ' boosts this week could be good news for @entity1
@entity7 will give keynote speech to @entity90 ; @entity28 won @entity93 primary in @entity29
he says @entity15 voters support @entity90 , who do n't return the favor by addressing their needs
*writer* : @entity28 's success might draw @entity1 to the right ; they 're in a position to gain influence
