-- did @entity1 rescue the @entity2 ? even with few box - office heavyweights in contention for top categories , sunday night 's @entity7 telecast rose slightly in the ratings from last year			2
@entity10 's awards coverage delivered 39.3 million viewers , up 4 percent from 2011 , according to the network			1
in the adult demo , the show received an 11.7 rating , off a tenth from 2011			0
the program out - delivered three of the past four @entity2 telecasts and ranked as @entity10 's most - watched program in two years			1
and yet , the @entity2 were outshone in one respect : @entity24 ' @entity23 coverage earlier this month pulled a slightly bigger audience than the usually dominant @entity2 , and totally stomped the @entity2 in the adult demo			1
the music awards show had 39.9 million viewers , just barely edging out sunday 's telecast			2
if last night 's viewership tally is sustained in @entity33 's national ratings release tomorrow , it will mark the first year the @entity23 drew a larger crowd than the @entity2 since @entity33 started its current ratings system in 1992			2
among adults 18 - 49 , there was no contest : grammys had a 14.1 rating to @entity2 11.7			0
here 's how the @entity2 have fared in recent years : -- 2011 : 37.9 million viewers / 11.8 adult demo rating ( " @entity43 " ) -- 2010 : 41.7 million viewers / 13.3 adult demo rating ( " @entity46 " ) -- 2009 : 36.3 million viewers / 12.1 adult demo rating ( " @entity49 " ) -- 2008 : 32 million viewers / 10.7 adult demo rating ( " @entity52 " ) -- lowest -- 2007 : 40.2 million viewers / 14.1 adult demo rating ( " @entity56 " ) ... -- 1998 : 55.2 million viewers ( " titanic " ) -- highest also sunday night : @entity24 ' " @entity60 " ( 7.6 million , 2.1 ) was down 25 percent this week ( understandably )			1
@entity62 's " @entity61 " ( 5 million , 1.8 ) was hammered down 31 percent ( also understandably -- if you like celebrities , are you going to watch @entity66 's @entity65 or the @entity2 ? )			0
