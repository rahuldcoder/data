-- the father of @entity2 , the soldier responsible for the largest leak of classified information in @entity6 history , says he believes his son did n't do it			1
he does n't see how he could have done it , @entity9 told @entity0 's @entity11 360 in an interview that aired tuesday night			2
" logistically , i ca n't understand -- because knowing computers as well as i do -- how you could get that much data out of a room with three other people in there , you know , sitting in close proximity , where everybody could see what everybody was doing , " he said			1
" i ca n't understand how that could be done			1
" his son , a former army intelligence analyst , was convicted last month of stealing and sending a trove of classified data to the website @entity28			2
what 's next for @entity2 ? he was acquitted of the most serious charge he faced , aiding the enemy , which could have put @entity2 in prison for life without the possibility of parole			2
now , he faces a maximum possible sentence of 90 years			0
when he entered guilty pleas on the lesser charges this year , @entity2 spent more than an hour in court reading a statement about why he had leaked the information			0
he said that the information he distributed " upset " or " disturbed " him , but none of it , he thought , would harm the @entity6 if it became public			0
" i believed that if the general public , especially the @entity6 public , had access to the information ... it could spark a domestic debate on the role of the military and our foreign policy in general as it related to @entity58 and @entity59 , " @entity2 said , according to a statement from his lawyer			1
is the @entity61 case @entity2 , part two ? asked about those comments , @entity9 said that he thought his son was posturing			1
" yeah , i think he was grandstanding , " he told @entity0 , adding that if his son was , in fact , responsible for the leak , he had no excuse for his actions			0
" i mean , i ca n't fathom any reason to myself why he should be -- that i should forgive him for doing something like that because it 's against my creed , or code of honor , " he said			1
@entity9 alluded to his time in the military , saying that he never spoke about what he did and wished his son had the same character			2
authorities say the younger @entity2 delivered three - quarters of a million pages of classified documents and videos to the secret - sharing site @entity28 , which never confirmed the soldier was the source of its information			1
the material covered numerous aspects of @entity6 military strategy in @entity58 , gave what some called a ground view of events in the @entity59 war and revealed the inner workings of @entity99 diplomacy in leaked cables			0
" it 's my country as well , and leaking information that 's going to damage my country , and the soldiers in our military , you know , that would be very upsetting , " @entity9 said			0
