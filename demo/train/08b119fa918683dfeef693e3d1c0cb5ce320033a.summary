two sources inside @entity2 's inner circle tell @entity3 that while @entity2 is n't planning a presidential bid , he 's listening to a lot of people who want him to get in the race -- although he remains skeptical himself			1
" a lot of people in @entity12 are rooting for him to get in , " says one source			2
" he 's not one of them			2
" another source close to @entity2 puts it this way : " i would n't bet on it , but i would n't bet either			1
" the key , these sources say , is that @entity2 wants to see a @entity23 candidate who can win the @entity24			1
so there 's a willingness to wait to see who will run for the @entity23 nomination			1
while these sources say that , as of today , it 's not likely @entity2 would run , it ca n't be ruled out entirely -- and if the early seeding were to produce a weak field , @entity2 might be in a position to be a late entrant			1
but as one ally points out , this is all " in the realm of the truly hypothetical , " and still remains " very unlikely			2
" even so , @entity2 allies are now indulging in the hypothetical			2
" if @entity2 were to run , " one source says , " he would be the last guy in the race			1
" several sources have said if @entity42 and @entity43 are running , @entity2 would be less likely to enter the race			1
one source adds that @entity2 is telling people that " he wants to see someone run who can beat @entity51			1
he believes the world has become a very dangerous place			2
" there are differences among those close to @entity2 about who could best beat @entity58			2
@entity2 , according to one of the sources , thinks @entity42 would be a winnable candidate			1
others in @entity62 disagree , saying he is too tied to @entity63 and is too rusty			2
@entity43 is another candidate who could have some appeal to @entity2 supporters , although to varying degrees			1
one former adviser says the @entity2 boomlet is " a byproduct of everybody else notdoing a great job " of starting their campaigns			0
he says if @entity42 were to decline a run , that would probably increase @entity2 's chances of running " by about 20 percent , " but he still says it 's a longshot related : how many ways can @entity2 say " no " to 2016 ? on the road again ? one big question is @entity2 's wife , @entity81 , who will be the key to any decision			1
she said " never again " after the last run			2
" i am over it , " she told @entity3 in june 2013			0
" it 's still hard to watch things and watch the news and feel like you wish you were there , but you move on			0
" related : @entity2 and @entity90 open up to @entity3 @entity90 was a reluctant warrior on the second presidential bid in 2012			0
but lately , she 's been more publicly cagey about it , telling @entity93 on @entity94 , " we will see , wo n't we ? " @entity2 himself has also been less definitive about his future -- clearly enjoying this spate of redemption , popularity and relevancy as a campaign surrogate			2
@entity104 @entity23 donors have not ruled out the @entity2 third - time - is - a - charm scenario , but they 're mostly not engaging right now			1
" they will start committing after the midterms , as that 's when the early train begins , " says one 2012 @entity2 financial supporter			0
he also added , however , that @entity43 now has the largest advantage " given his relationships with key donors in the @entity113			1
" there is some benefit , this financial supporter says , to having a candidate who has been vetted multiple times			0
the downside , he adds , is putting the family through it again			0
in the year after their presidential loss , @entity2 and @entity90 were not shy about saying their time has come and gone for a presidential bid , after losing twice			0
" it 's not my time , " @entity2 told me in june 2013			0
" i did n't win			1
it 's time for someone else to get in there and give it their best shot			0
" @entity2 on 2016 : it 's time for someone else although , in that same interview , @entity2 spoke of the experience of running as a " thrill			0
" " and frankly i 'd do it again , but -- but it 's not my time , " he said then			0
that was one year ago			0
out of the limelight since ending his 2012 campaign , @entity2 has mostly stayed out of the limelight			0
he has hosted an annual conference of policy and political leaders and donors in @entity153 , @entity154 , to discuss some of the nation 's problems and talk about solutions			0
this year , he has appeared at a number of fund - raisers and public events for candidates , proving to be one of the @entity23 's most popular surrogates -- and fiercest critics of president @entity167 's foreign and defense policies			1
he wrote a @entity168 op - ed earlier this month arguing against defense budget cuts , saying policy makers " ... will choose whether to succumb to the easy path of continued military hollowing or to honor their constitutional pledge to protect the @entity174			0
" on monday , he appeared at a rally for @entity23 candidates in @entity178 , focusing his criticism on the president 's remarks on " @entity182 " that the nation 's intelligence community had underestimated @entity185			1
" for the president to say , ' @entity190 , we underestimated @entity185 ' suggests he was n't looking at the kinds of ideas that were being brought to him , " he told the audience , explaining that ideas about how to deal with the terrorist group were brought to him as early as january			2
" i guess he was busy doing other things -- vacations , golf , fund - raising			0
he just has n't done the job he promised to do			2
" besides the @entity178 event and a fund - raiser for @entity203 candidate @entity202 tuesday , @entity2 appeared this month at a birthday event for @entity43 , who some @entity2 supporters criticized for being too close to @entity167 during the aftermath of @entity207 in 2012			1
@entity2 will be stepping up his surrogacy work as the campaign heads into the home stretch , with part of his itinerary taking him to some of the key battlegrounds for control of the @entity216			0
on wednesday , he goes to a fundraiser for @entity219 gov. @entity218 ; on thursday , he 'll stump with @entity216 minority leader @entity220 and also attend a rally with @entity223 @entity23 candidates			1
friday , @entity2 travels to @entity224 for @entity216 nominee rep. @entity225 , and later goes to @entity154 for @entity24 candidate @entity226			1
the @entity227 also spend a lot of time with their 22 grandchildren			0
they told the @entity232 ' @entity231 in an upcoming article they are scaling down			0
they 're selling their @entity237 townhouse and are considering doing the same with their seaside home in @entity240 , @entity241 -- which sparked some negative press when word leaked they wanted to add a car elevator there -- and will make their home in @entity154 , where one of their sons lives			0
3 reasons @entity2 will run in 2016 ( and 4 reasons he wo n't )			1

romney advisers have tried to interest him in another run for the @entity24
if he were to run , it would only be if he *feared* a @entity23 would n't win
@entity43 and @entity42 are among the *republicans* he most wants to see run
