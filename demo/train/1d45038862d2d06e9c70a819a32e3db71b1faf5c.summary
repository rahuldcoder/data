editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			2
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- before you complain again about living in 2010 and not yet having a jetpack to fly you to work , consider taking a trip to @entity22			1
there 's only one person in the world who produces a complete flying rocket belt from start to finish -- from the parts to the fuel that powers it			1
his name is @entity34 and he lives in @entity35 , a city two hours south of @entity36			1
so @entity9 sister technology channel @entity37 traveled to visit him at his company , @entity39 ( @entity38 )			0
a self - taught scientist and inventor whose technologies have traveled the world from @entity44 to @entity45 , from @entity46 to the @entity47 , @entity34 considers his biggest achievement not his jetpack , but a machine that produces pure hydrogen peroxide that he uses as fuel for most of his inventions			1
apart from his rocket belt , he 's assembled a rocket bicycle , rocket motorcycle , rocket dragster and a personal helicopter			1
then there 's the hydrogen - peroxide - powered rocket belt			2
while at least one company has recently promised to bring personal flying machines to market , these conveyances only rely on propellers , not jets			0
but the real thing ai n't cheap			0
if you ca n't afford the system , priced at around u.s. $ 125,000 , you can pay him to drop by your party for only $ 20,000			0
see the rest of @entity73 at @entity9 among many other projects , @entity34 's working with a group of scientists on a car that will run on seawater , converted into hydrogen peroxide by electrolytic cells powered by solar energy			1
it 's a project , he says , that will completely transform transportation and energy in the near future			0
@entity34 and his daughter -- the only woman to fly a jetpack -- take his creations for test - drives in their backyard			1
while he could n't fly for us ( he recently broke his ribs and shoulder while taking his rocket bike for a spin at 80 mph ) , he gave us a tour of his workshop to share with us his favorite machines and a philosophy of invention built on hard work , self - teaching , and lots of jet fuel .			0

@entity22 scientist devises , builds , tests jetpacks in his backyard
@entity34 has traveled world with inventions ; worked with @entity47 , @entity46
@entity34 's other creations *include* rocket bicycle , rocket motorcycle , personal helicopter
