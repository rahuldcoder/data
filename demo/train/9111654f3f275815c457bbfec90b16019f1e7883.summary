-- today marks one year since a tragic fire at the @entity3 factory in @entity4 killed 112 workers			1
when the fire alarms went off that day , managers acted with indifference and forced workers to stay at their stations			1
months later , devastation again struck @entity4 's workers when the @entity14 building collapsed , killing 1,131			1
inspectors had declared the building unsafe , yet management compelled the workers to enter with threats of lost pay or termination			0
these twin tragedies galvanized world attention on the terrible conditions under which @entity4 workers produce over $ 20 billion worth of clothing for consumers abroad each year			1
for many @entity27 , @entity4 is a far - off nation on the other side of the world			1
the challenges workers face there seem distant			0
but in this country we have risen in solidarity when workers ' rights have been ignored			2
just as the 1911 @entity38 in @entity39 resulted in dramatic changes to @entity27 factory safety standards , the tragedies in @entity4 are a call to action for consumers in @entity27			1
the principles of fairness and equality for working men and women are deeply interwoven within the fabric of our nation 's history			0
no one will want to wear clothes made in @entity4 if they are stained with the blood of workers			1
after these tragedies , i urged the @entity59 administration to suspend preferential duty - free status for certain products from @entity4			1
our government responded and since the suspension of @entity67 benefits , @entity4 's government has dropped charges against labor activists and begun to allow local unions to form			2
in addition to pressure from our government , @entity27 and @entity72 companies are working together to establish common standards for fire and building safety			0
a 77 % increase in the minimum wage was announced but is not yet enacted			0
the @entity81 's @entity80 is training union organizers and the @entity83 has established a program to help develop durable institutions to protect workers ' rights			1
but considerable long - term work remains			0
unions have a troubled history in @entity4			2
in the past they were subject to undue influence by political forces with agendas that did not put workers first			0
this legacy will be difficult to overcome -- workers need to feel safe in joining a union and management needs to understand that unions can play a constructive role in worker safety as well as factory production			2
however , there are disturbing signs of backsliding , so @entity107 governments and consumers must remain vigilant			0
some factory managers have intimidated union organizers and thugs have reportedly attacked workers who dared to organize			2
dozens of workers have died in fires in @entity4 's factories since @entity14 collapsed			1
we have a responsibility and an opportunity to bring about change in @entity4 's garment industry			2
first , the @entity27 must remain vigilant and ensure that labor law reforms are correctly implemented and labor organizers are protected from anti-union activity			0
we should also increase funding for efforts , such as the @entity81 's @entity80 programs , that support workers ' capacity to organize and engage in collective bargaining			0
second , the government of @entity4 and the garment industry associations should immediately develop and apply tough sanctions against factory owners who engage in anti-union activity			1
finally , international companies must continue to require their supplier factories to abide by strict safety and labor standards			0
the latter will require long - term , well - resourced programs to educate their suppliers on workers ' rights and constructive worker - management relations			2
they should also implement a zero - tolerance policy for suppliers who consistently engage in anti-union activity			0
a @entity4 with a fully empowered work force and safe factories will require sustained action by its government , apparel companies , domestic factory owners , organized labor as well as the international community			1
it will take time , but this time there can be no going back			0
a year ago , the world woke up to the horror caused by unsafe working conditions in @entity4			1
we owe it to the victims and the four million garment workers in @entity4 , who produce a lot of the clothes we wear , to maintain pressure until @entity4 's workers are given the rights they deserve and the tools they need to protect themselves			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			0
