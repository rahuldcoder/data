@entity0 will soon have a new name and a new face -- thanks to @entity5			1
specifically , it 's thanks to the social media giant 's founder , @entity10 , and his wife , dr. @entity11			1
the @entity12 says the couple 's $ 75 million gift is " believed to be the largest single private gift from individuals to a public hospital in the @entity18			1
it 's not just a substantial gift , but a personal one			0
@entity21 worked for years at the facility -- the @entity25 city 's lone trauma center -- during her pediatric residency			1
she came away struck by the importance of @entity31 's main " safety net " hospital ( where more than 70 % of patients are underinsured or uninsured ) , as well as impressed by those who work there			1
" day in and day out , i witness the compassion and dedication of my colleagues as they work tirelessly to deliver the best available care to all of our patients , " @entity21 said in a statement released friday through the foundation			0
" @entity10 and i are proud to support such an important public hospital			1
@entity46 , as it 's known , is in the process of a " rebuild " to create a nine - story , 453,000 - square foot main hospital and new trauma center			1
it 's scheduled to open in december			0
@entity10 , posting ( of course ) on @entity5 , said that " our contribution ... will allow @entity55 to double the size of its new @entity57 and quadruple the number of beds , and provide state of the art equipment for healthcare providers and first responders			1
" " we are so fortunate that our work in connecting the world through @entity5 has given us the ability to give back to our local community , our country and the world -- and to work to improve education , health care and internet access for everyone , " he said			0
" to serve our community in @entity31 , we can think of no better place to focus than @entity46			0
" in light of the pledge , the city has started the process of officially naming the facility @entity80 and @entity10 @entity0 and @entity81 , according to the foundation			1
it 's not common that someone , especially one going through the rigors of residency , pays back their employer rather than gets paid			2
@entity21 and @entity10 are in a position to break from the norm			2
@entity91 reported last fall that @entity10 , 30 , had a net worth of $ 34 billion			2
so the hospital donation will hardly set him back much			2
still , it fits a pattern of generosity by he and his wife , who the @entity99 reports pledged $ 6.2 billion -- more than anyone else -- in 2013 alone			0
even with her husband 's wealth , @entity21 has n't stopped working			0
the @entity105 , @entity106 , native met @entity10 at @entity107 , where both were students			2
they were a couple for years before getting married in 2012			0
this happened days after @entity21 's graduation from the @entity113 , @entity31 , medical school			0
her @entity5 profile says that she went on to work at @entity116			0
during a 2012 interview with @entity118 , @entity10 said that @entity21 's work comes up regularly -- just like his does			1
" she 's going to be a pediatrician , " he said then , " so our dinner conversations are often about @entity5 and the kids that she 's meeting			0
" no doubt such discussions fed into their donation to @entity0			1
while the couple now calls nearby @entity132 home , they have long and deep ties to @entity31			0
and , as @entity10 said friday , " we hope this contribution alongside the great work of other contributors , will help @entity55 to continue to save lives and deliver care to everyone who needs it			2

facility will become @entity80 and @entity10 @entity0
@entity10 's wife , dr. @entity11 , worked at hospital in residency
