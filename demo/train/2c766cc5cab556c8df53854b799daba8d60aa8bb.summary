@entity0 , @entity1 -- on his knees , @entity3 prays			1
he is a condemned man about to die in a brutal way			0
his crime : the killing of his lover 's husband			1
the judge : a local warlord in @entity12 , @entity1			1
the executioner : the victim 's father			1
a mobile phone video captured the grisly scene			1
many have gathered to watch this act , sitting on dusty earth , in dappled shade			0
@entity3 , wrapped in a white shawl , gets up from his prayer mat. his alleged victim 's father is led by another man to @entity3			1
" hold the gun right , " the man tells the father			0
@entity3 falls to the ground			2
two more shots ring out			0
the warlord ordered the man to pull the trigger twice , but he kept on , unable to deliver a swift fatal shot			2
" stop shooting , you donkey , " the spectators say			0
" he 's still alive , " says one			0
this is not a video taken before 2001 , in the days when the @entity43 ruled and @entity0 's stadium was reserved not for soccer , but public executions			2
it 's from last month			0
after a decade of the @entity50 - led war to defeat extremism in @entity1 , feudal justice still exists			1
in remote @entity12 , outside the reach of @entity55 or the @entity1 government , warlord @entity52 and his men rule by the gun			1
@entity52 helps keep the @entity43 at bay , the people say , so the government lets him run his own fiefdom			0
it 's not the sort of compromise the @entity50 imagined a decade ago , bringing a type of justice that 's swift and brutal			2
@entity67 has said that in large parts of @entity1 , no formal judicial system is in place and only tribal and other customary forms of justice are practiced			1
and a scathing report issued last year by the @entity74 described @entity1 's judicial system as being " in a catastrophic state of disrepair			1
" a growing majority of @entity1 have been forced to accept the rough justice of @entity43 and criminal power brokers in areas of the country that lie beyond government control			1
" the report went on to say that the @entity50 has not paid the same attention to justice reform as it has to other aspects of nation building			0
" its investment in judicial institutions is modest , as opposed to the billions invested in standing up the @entity1 army and police , " the report said			2
the @entity92 allocated only 1 % of its @entity1 budget between 2002 and 2007 -- $ 64 million -- to supporting the establishment of rule of law , the report said			2
human rights monitors have pressed president @entity98 's government to prioritize the establishment of a professional judiciary			0
but @entity3 's execution is more evidence that @entity1 has a long way to go			1
there have been other cases that have sparked outrage			0
in 2006 , @entity107 was arrested and threatened with death for converting to @entity109			0
last year , the @entity43 ordered the first public executions by stoning since their fall from power -- a young couple who had eloped died in horrific fashion			0
@entity115 , who witnessed @entity3 's execution , said @entity52 gathered local mullahs to reach a verdict according to sharia , or @entity120 law			1
" the mullahs asked the father to forgive @entity3 and to take some of his family 's land and women in compensation , " he said			1
" but the father refused , so the mullahs ordered an execution			2
" @entity3 tried to buy his release , but @entity52 refused , @entity115 said			2
he 's not one to take bribes			0
after the killing , @entity3 first said he had been helped by his cousins , according to @entity132 , one of @entity3 's cousins			1
" for that reason , we were interrogated and beaten a lot during the questioning , " @entity132 said			0
but later , when questioned by @entity52 , @entity3 changed his story and said he had killed alone , @entity132 said			1
another cousin , @entity139 , wished for law and order			0
" we 'd like strong government , " he said			0
" there 's no police or government presence here , and @entity52 has government contacts			0
" @entity3 was a man whose jealousy allegedly led him to kill the man married to his lover			1
it 's a story that has played out countless times in countless places			2
but here , in @entity12 , there was no trial , no jury of peers			0
@entity3 's punishment was strictly @entity159 , meted out in frightful fashion			1
@entity2 's @entity161 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 , and @entity162 reported from @entity163 .			2

a warlord condemned @entity3 to death after he allegedly killed his lover 's husband
the victim 's father shot him *multiple* times
the execution was captured on a cell phone video
without a strong court system , @entity1 have had to accept tribal justice
