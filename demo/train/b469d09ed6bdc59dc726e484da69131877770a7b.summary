" captain @entity16 has refused to sail the ship , so they 're towing it , " @entity14 told @entity0 in a reference to @entity16 , captain of the @entity17			1
late thursday , about 15 members of the @entity11 coast guard seized the ship and those aboard by sliding down a rope hanging from a hovering helicopter			1
the guards , armed with handguns and rifles , took the activists to the ship 's canteen and broke down the door to the communications room , smashing the equipment , said @entity34 , head of media for the group			1
the captives were told they were going to be taken to @entity13 , in northwest @entity11 , he said			2

" " they have done nothing to warrant this level of aggression and have been entirely peaceful throughout , " said @entity73 , the head of @entity2 's @entity7 oil campaign			1
" the real threat to the @entity11 @entity7 comes not from the crew of the @entity17 but from @entity81 , one of the most reckless oil companies in the world today , " he said			1
@entity16 , who grew up in @entity85 , @entity86 , is the son of a yachtsman and has been a skipper for @entity2 since 1981 , according to a posting on the @entity2 website			1

" @entity81 is using out of date kit to drill in one of the most extreme environments on the planet , " the group said in a tweet on september 17			0
