-- we are a nosy country			1
though to be fair , it 's not entirely our fault			1
between the 24/7 news cycle , social media and reality tv , we have been spoon fed other people 's private business for so long we now assume it 's a given to know everything			2
and if there are people who choose not to disclose , they must be hiding something			0
being told that something 's " none of your business " is slowly being characterized as rude , and if such a statement is coming from the government , it seems incriminating			1
yet , not everything is our business			0
and in the political arena , there are things that should be and need to be kept quiet			2
news : @entity31 , @entity33 clash over @entity35 executive privilege i know that 's hard to digest in a society where pregnancies and marriages of d - list celebrities make the cover of @entity43 , but there comes a point where the public 's right to know needs to take a back seat to matters like national security and diplomacy			1
heads should roll because of the @entity35 debacle			1
we do n't need every detail of that operation to be made public in order for that to happen			1
if it were an isolated sting , maybe			2
but it is at least the third incarnation of a gun - running scheme stretching across two administrations , which means we could be pressing to open @entity65			0
we do not want to open @entity65 , not about this and certainly not about a bunch of other potentially scandalous things the federal government has been involved with			1
we still do n't have access to all of the messy facts surrounding the @entity72 that erupted during the @entity74 administration			2
all we know is that weapons were sold to @entity76 in exchange for hostages and that the proceeds from those sales were used to illegally fund rebels in @entity82 who were supposedly fighting @entity83			0
lt. col. @entity84 took one for the team back then , and there 's a good chance attorney general @entity88 will have to take one for the team in the @entity35 controversy			1
and by team , i 'm not referring to @entity93 or @entity94 , but rather @entity95			0
you see , freedom is n't entirely free			2
it also is n't squeaky clean			2
and sometimes the federal government deems it necessary to get its hands a little dirty in the hopes of achieving something we generally accept as good for the country			1
news : by the numbers : @entity35 such as the death of @entity109			1
we danced , we cried , but we did not make a big deal about a secret operation that was executed in @entity113 without the permission of the @entity113 government			1
the @entity117 administration did what it thought was in the best interest of @entity95			0
much in the same way , @entity120 and @entity121 -- the earlier versions of @entity35 under president @entity123 -- were executed with the hope that they will do more good than harm			1
hardly anyone in the public knows the finer points of these programs			2
were they legal ? hell no. were they effective ? who knows ? were they done as a way to keep @entity95 safe ? yes			0
@entity137 was a fall guy			0
not for president @entity74 but for all of us			0
just as @entity88 has become a villain to many who are pointing fingers at him			0
but to go much beyond the criticism of these men runs the risk of learning that this great nation of ours is heavily involved in doing some things that are not so great			2
think about it : we have allowed weapons to cross the @entity153 border and into the hands of criminals for years			0
many of these weapons were involved in killing innocent @entity153			0
there 's nothing very admirable about that			0
but the truth is , it 's very @entity95			0
by allowing guns to infiltrate @entity153 's drug cartel , we thought we could trace them up the ladder to the leaders			0
take off the head and the body dies			0
as for the innocent people who lost their lives ? collateral damage			0
that 's the uncomfortable backstory to this scandal			1
and there are likely other operations like it in our nation 's history that we do n't even have a clue about			1
and maybe it 's better for us not to be so nosy , not to know everything because , to paraphrase the famous line from the movie " @entity187 , " many of us wo n't be able to handle the truth			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			1

@entity190 : in things like national security , the public does n't need to know the details
@entity190 : @entity35 scandal is n't the first secret sting from the government
he says our government sometimes gets its hands dirty in order to achieve a *broader* goal
@entity190 : maybe it 's better for us not to be so nosy about these kinds of operations
