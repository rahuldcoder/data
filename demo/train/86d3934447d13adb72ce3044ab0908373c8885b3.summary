with six years and dozens of @entity2 nominations under his belt , president @entity0 has learned that first picks do n't always work out			1
that lesson , introduced before he even took office , is only made clearer by the process of replacing outgoing defense secretary @entity8			1
the top names on the @entity11 " shortlist " -- which included former high - ranking @entity13 official @entity12 , homeland security secretary @entity14 and @entity17 @entity16 sen. @entity15 -- all withdrew themselves from consideration			1
@entity0 's expected pick , former @entity13 number two @entity20 , was on the shortlist too			1
but reports he 'd been selected for the job only emerged after the others dropped out			0
the letdown of going with second ( or third ) choices for @entity2 positions is n't new for @entity0			1
here are other first picks who did n't make it : @entity31 -- secretary of state when secretary of state @entity33 left her post following @entity0 's re-election in 2012 , @entity31 quickly emerged as the frontrunner to replace her			1
then the @entity39 ambassador to the @entity40 , @entity37 was seen as a close @entity0 confidante who had earned the his trust beginning with her work as a policy adviser during the 2008 campaign			1
but her prospects of becoming the nation 's top diplomat faded amid uproar over her statements about the september 2012 attacks on the @entity39 mission in @entity53 , @entity54 , which @entity55 claimed were misleading			0
@entity0 consistently defended @entity37 from the attacks , even saying that if @entity55 wanted to go after someone in the administration on @entity53 , " they should go after me			1
" but anticipating a drawn - out and rancorous confirmation process on @entity60 , @entity37 withdrew her name from consideration			0
in a letter to @entity0 , she wrote " the confirmation process would be lengthy , disruptive , and costly -- to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities			1
that trade - off is simply not worth it to our country			0
" @entity0 eventually picked then - sen. @entity71 for the post , and @entity37 moved into the @entity11 as the president 's @entity73			1
@entity75 -- @entity76 secretary before he was even sworn into office , @entity0 had felt the sting of a first - choice nominee being stymied by controversy			1
@entity75 , the former @entity82 from @entity83 , had been a staunch and important supporter of @entity0 's , endorsing him almost a year before early primaries and caucuses in 2008			1
his name ( along with many others ) was even floated as a potential vice presidential pick			0
when it came time to name a nominee for @entity76 secretary , @entity75 was a natural choice			0
@entity0 announced his pick in december 2008 , after he had won the election but before he took office			2
two months later , the nomination was in shambles : @entity75 admitted failing to report $ 15,000 in charitable donations and conceded he had n't reported using a car service			0
that was after he was forced to pay $ 140,000 in back taxes			0
recognizing the political firestorm ahead , @entity75 withdrew his nomination			0
later , @entity0 admitted he made a mistake in how he handled the process			2
" i think i screwed up , " he told @entity106 's @entity105			0
" and i take responsibility for it and we 're going to make sure we fix it so it does n't happen again			0
" later that month , @entity0 nominated @entity112 , then the governor of @entity113 , to run his health agency			2
@entity115 and @entity116 -- commerce secretary @entity118 is n't typically the highest profile post in a president 's administration			0
but in the early days of @entity0 's tenure the task of filling the job turned into multiple disappointments , as one candidate became embroiled in disclosure problems and another withdrew for ideological reasons			1
@entity115 , the former @entity129 administration official who in 2008 was serving as governor of @entity131 , was @entity0 's first pick for @entity133			2
former rivals during the @entity16 primaries , @entity115 endorsed @entity0 during the extended battle with @entity129			2
but the nomination process soured as federal investigators looked into @entity115 's ties to a company that did business with his state			0
@entity115 denied any wrongdoing , but said the extended probe would force an " untenable delay " in his confirmation process			0
sen. @entity116 , a @entity55 from @entity147 , was @entity0 's next pick			2
he was one of three republicans @entity0 had asked to join his @entity2 in an attempt to convene a " team of rivals " in @entity151			1
and while @entity0 likely anticipated some disagreements , @entity116 eventually realized their differences would be impossible to overcome			2
he withdrew his nomination citing " irresolvable conflicts " with @entity0 's economic plans , and said it had " obviously " been a mistake to accept the nomination in the first place			1
@entity163 , who had served as governor of @entity165 , was the third -- and final -- pick for the job			0
@entity168 -- surgeon general shortly after taking office , @entity0 considered tapping neurosurgeon and @entity106 chief medical correspondent @entity168 as his surgeon general			2
aides said @entity168 was @entity0 's top choice for the post , which is the nation 's highest - ranking official for public health issues but is n't a cabinet - level position			2
but after speaking with senior members of @entity0 's administration , @entity168 withdrew his name , saying he would have been forced to give up practicing medicine to take the job			1
he told @entity185 he felt flattered to have been considered for the job , but that the timing was inconvenient			0
it was n't for another four months that @entity0 named his eventual pick , @entity191 physician @entity190 .			0

@entity20 emerged as the frontrunner after other candidates withdrew
