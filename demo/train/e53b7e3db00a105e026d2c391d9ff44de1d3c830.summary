@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's the dirty little secret of the racing industry			1
thoroughbreds who do n't make the winner 's circle , are injured or simply too old to race are discarded by their owners , auctioned off -- sometimes to the slaughterhouse			1
now these horses are getting new lives			1
the twist ? prison inmates looking for their own second chances are helping save them			1
in the rolling hills of @entity18 , @entity1 , is @entity19			1
@entity20 leads a horse to the pasture to graze			2
" @entity23 is a beautiful horse			2
i love him , " says @entity20			2
" i think he 's a gentle giant			2
" the 7 - year - old gelding came to the farm after a leg injury ended his racing career			1
each year thousands of racehorses in the @entity33 like @entity23 are sent to slaughterhouses and their meat sold overseas , according to the nonprofit @entity36			2
that 's why the foundation funds programs in eight prisons across the @entity33 to rescue these abandoned horses and train prisoners to " gentle " them so they can be adopted			1
the inmates also have duties beyond grooming the horses			1
they maintain the farm buildings and the grounds			2
@entity20 , 44 , figures he has spent at least 14 years of his life behind bars			2
it is his third prison sentence , this time for drug possession			2
" it could have been a lot worse , " he confides			0
" a lot of guys that i grew up with ... are deceased			0
" but @entity20 maintains this will be his last time in prison and he thinks working with @entity23 as part of this program is what has changed him			1
" it gave me a chance to really evaluate who i am , " he says			0
" everybody thinks it 's about the horses , " says @entity65 , secretary of public safety for @entity1 prisons			1
@entity65 saw the benefits of the program in other prison systems where he worked and brought it here			0
" it 's really about the men that work with the horses and what changes they go through as they learn to care for an animal , as they learn mutual trust and self - respect			1
" the bond between @entity20 and @entity23 is evident as the inmate gently prods the animal for grooming and softly speaks to him			1
@entity20 calls the bond they share a mutual support system			1
" i have a chance to face my obstacles head on and to overcome [ them ] , " he says , and " [ @entity23 ] knows we are here for him ... [ that ] we love him			0
" @entity97 worked with racehorses many years ago before coming to work for the @entity100			0
she is the program coordinator for @entity19 and says she daily observes the unconditional acceptance the horses have for the inmates as each come to trust the other			1
they learn patience , " says @entity97			0
" if you have a 150 - pound gentleman and you have a 1,200 - pound horse and you need the horse to do something , you 're not going to teach that horse to do it through brute force			0
" there is a striking difference between the farm and the prison , where the inmates return each night			1
there are guards at the farm but no bars , no razor wire			0
@entity20 notes the atmosphere of serenity at the farm , far from what he calls " negative conversations " at the prison			0
" you look at these grounds , the meadows , the horses grazing in the field , " says @entity132 , assistant commissioner , @entity100			1
" it can only put gentleness inside of you , " she says , smiling			0
it 's her responsibility to make sure each inmate is ready to begin life outside the prison walls			1
" it gives them a sense of humanity , " she says			0
@entity148 calls the program an opportunity to change a life			0
he will be released from prison in just a few months			0
he plans to move to his grandfather 's farm to care for his aging father			1
" if i could come out here and take care of @entity23 every day , " he says , " then i can go home and take care of my father			2
" @entity148 considers that a measure of the success of the program			0
" our responsibility is to send a man or woman out of prison a better person			0
" as @entity20 cleans and scrapes @entity23 's hooves , he speaks with pride about his time at @entity19			1
" i love the work and i love to know that i have a responsibility and they can depend on me for that responsibility being met			0
" @entity97 says she believes in each of the inmates who has gone through the program			2
she likes to quote visitors her favorite @entity182 passage , " there is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man			0
" " that is absolutely true here , " she says			0
" i see it every day			0
