-- one of the scariest scenarios of any sport must be the realization by a jockey that the half - tonne animal underneath him is not going to land successfully as it flies over a fence six feet high at nearly 50 kilometers per hour			1
the onrushing blades of grass appear like blurred lines of green just prior to the ground stopping both rider and horse in brutal fashion			1
in the blink of an eye , a kaleidoscope of colors can turn to black -- and lives can be turned upside down			1
it is the nightmare prospect for any jockey , his family and friends too , in a sport whose protagonists are constantly followed by an ambulance -- a regular reminder of the all - too - real threat of severe injury , potential paralysis and , in extreme cases , death			1
" i was numb when i heard the news , " said @entity34 , whose son @entity35 was in a coma for 13 days after he fell at @entity38 's @entity37 , on @entity39 day , in 2011			1
" it just was n't really sinking in			1
" thankfully , after years of hard work , which involved being taught to talk again during 18 months in rehab , the @entity43 's prognosis is overwhelmingly good			2
now 25 , @entity35 is not only walking and talking , albeit at a somewhat slower pace , but is also -- miraculously in the eyes of many -- riding again			2
despite his experiences , @entity34 still gets tongue - tied when meeting a fellow @entity43 jockey			2
in march , @entity51 -- widely regarded as one of the most effective amateur jockeys in the history of @entity56 racing -- fell at the popular @entity57			1
reportedly a month away from retirement , the 37 - year - old has been paralyzed from the neck down ever since			2
" @entity63 will never leave your mind , " said @entity34 , who had visited his friend a couple of days before talking to @entity0			2
" i just pray to @entity66 that that did n't happen to me			2
it was the simplest of falls and you ca n't believe the damage			2
he can move his head around and talk just fine , but he ca n't do anything else			2
" given his own past , does @entity34 have any words of advice ? " no chance , " he replied solemnly			2
" all i can do is just go to see him and be there for him			2
" as he knows only too well , the advantages of having someone thinking of you can be immeasurable			2
for from the moment his charge @entity89 fell in an incident he still does n't remember , the pioneering @entity85 ( @entity86 ) was by @entity34 's side			0
founded in 1964 to assist two paralyzed riders , one of whom had fallen in that year 's @entity39 , the organization has been easing the lives of those with career - debilitating injuries ever since			1
not only does the @entity86 provide instant logistical support and limitless rehabilitative work at a state - of - the - art building , its host of initiatives also include the provision of mortgages for those whose incomes have been decimated by injury			1
" basically , we are a charity to support beneficiaries in a financial , medical and emotional way , " @entity109 , the ceo of the @entity86 , told @entity0			1
" in over 49 years , we have supported over 1,000 beneficiaries			1
" last year , the @entity115 - based organization assisted more than 500 members of the racing family , with 35 -- or 7 % -- being new cases			1
not all of them are jockeys , for a quarter of the workload is devote to stable lads and grooms , but the procedure is often the same whenever anyone is seriously injured			1
leaving all medical care to professional doctors , the @entity86 initially concentrates on arranging the logistical needs that can overload friends and family -- dispatching one of its so - called " almoners " to assess all the varying requirements			0
" the most difficult bit of the job is when you do get somebody who is seriously injured because as much as you try to stay distant from it , you ca n't help but have it get under your skin , " said @entity135 , one of the body 's nine almoners			1
" you are living and breathing the accident with their family and friends yet you must remain separate from it and not let it affect you			0
" if you 're falling to pieces because you find it hard , you 're absolutely no use to anyone else -- and that can be quite difficult			0
but equally , if you are able to do even a little bit to help , then it 's hugely rewarding			0
" described as " a one in a million " by @entity34 , @entity156 was the almoner sent to look after the family when @entity35 suffered his career - ending fall			1
with doctors attending the comatose jockey , @entity156 devoted her attentions to the family , arranging their transfer from @entity165 and accommodation in @entity37 among a myriad of other measures			0
" i just ca n't imagine how it would have been without @entity135 or the @entity86 , " said @entity34			0
" you are not thinking those first few days			0
you 're just in a different world , wondering how the outcome is going to be			0
" having @entity135 there was hugely important			0
you wonder where you would have started otherwise			0
from the time @entity35 got hurt , she was on the scene at the hospital and she never left			0
" today , @entity35 is back home in @entity165 , his racing career cruelly taken from his grasp ( " forget that -- that 's gone , " he says sadly ) , but he is able to ride out horses for one of his old trainers			1
his road to recovery was hugely helped by a lengthy stay at @entity189 , the purpose - built rehabilitation center opened in the southern @entity191 county of @entity192 and named after @entity86 founder @entity193			0
the charity also flew @entity34 back to @entity165 , so how can it afford such extensive service ? " generous supporters , donations , legacies and @entity200 work , " said @entity109			1
" we need $ 4m to cover our costs every year and that is what we typically get			1
we are very fortunate the racing community has taken the @entity86 to its heart			1
" they empathize with the dangers of a jockey 's life			0
those supporters who watch on tv or go to the course see what the jockeys are doing , derive pleasure from it and this is their way of giving back			0
" so much so that the charity is in a position to give significant financial benefit to those in need			1
take the case of @entity225 , an assistant trainer kicked so hard in the head by a horse that his life hung in the balance			0
after a year in hospital and 14 operations to rebuild his skull , @entity225 's wages crumpled -- so the @entity86 stepped in			0
" we take over the mortgages of jockeys who can not fulfill their payments , " @entity109 explained			0
" we then link the mortgage to the house price index , which means our money is secure and which means they do not lose their home			0
it is a long - term way of helping our beneficiaries			1
" it is also yet another remarkable service from an organization little known outside @entity56 racing circles			1
next year , the @entity86 will celebrate its 50th birthday -- and is opening a new building in the north of @entity191 , in @entity254 , as it does so			0
yet this will not set the tone for the second half of its century			0
" we ca n't open any more centers as we have to cut our cloth accordingly , " says @entity109			0
" there are only so many jockeys			0
we are reasonably well - financed and that is due to prudent care			0
" in the meantime , the @entity86 will go about its essential business : an organization no fit jockey wants to know too well , yet one that none can live without should misfortune come calling .			1
