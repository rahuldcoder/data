@entity0 -- the world 's largest computer chip maker @entity2 faces an uncertain future			1
in a @entity8 world where mobile is king , the @entity6 stalwart is aware it 's fallen behind on innovation			1
but in an effort to turn the tide , @entity2 unveiled a bevy of concept products reflecting the latest industry trend -- the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) at the @entity18 in @entity19 earlier this month			1
there were gesture tracking 3d cameras , smart earbuds that can track fitness activities , a bluetooth personal assistant headset nicknamed " @entity26 " after @entity28 's own virtual aide , a baby monitor of the future in the form of a onesie that observes the child and relays information back to the parent and smart watches galore			2
behind the bold strategic expansion is @entity38 , the highest - ranked female at the company and president of @entity2			1
a veteran of the tech giant with over 25 years experience , @entity41 makes up one half of @entity2 's new two - person executive duo along with ceo @entity47			1
together they manage over 100,000 employees worldwide			0
" we 're very excited about the strategy and what we 're going to do with the company , " @entity41 tells @entity1			1
" when i started in this industry , we were all about building pcs , in the early - mid 90s			1
and pcs at the time changed the way people lived			2
" we invented mobile laptops , so we were very good at a certain kind of mobile			2
what we did n't do , and i think that we got behind on , was going even lower -- phones			0
" with an established smartphone market already in place , @entity41 is pushing the chip maker to focus on the recently announced " @entity77 " product which they tout as a computer the size of an sd card and other highly - integrated smaller processors like their new " @entity76 " chips , tailor - made for wearable tech applications			1
the software side of the business is an arena she knows well			0
over the years @entity41 -- who was recently named one of @entity85 's most powerful women in business -- has spearheaded company strategy through various r&d leadership positions at @entity2			1
" i do a lot more of what you would consider operational , the manufacturing , human resources			0
but i did keep the business units that i had before -- software services , security			0
" during her ascent to the top of the corporate ladder , @entity41 got to work under @entity101 -- a pioneer in the semiconductor industry			1
a legend in his own right , @entity41 says meeting @entity106 was one of the most important moments in her career			1
not that the initial introduction during a presentation went all that smoothly			0
" we got into a little bit of an argument because he started to tell me how [ the technology ] worked and i said , ' no , no , no. ' and apparently you do n't argue with @entity101			0
" i was too young , too stupid to know better ... so i thought i 'm going to get fired			0
" but for @entity106 , it was quite the opposite			0
he liked her gumption and years later made @entity41 his technical assistant and then chief of staff			1
" he 's a fabulous mentor			2
i learned more about thinking , about industry structures and strategy and [ about ] ' what 's the real issue ? ' from him than i 'll learn from anybody			2
" despite this wealth of knowledge and experience , many questioned her appointment as the company 's number two in early 2013			1
there have n't been a lot of women at the top of semiconductor companies , " she says			0
" @entity143 [ the criticism ] makes me want to be more successful ... i try to focus on what [ @entity2 ] needs to do to be successful			1
what 's the next big thing ? ' additionally she refuses to let gender be seen as a handicap and instead embraces how being a women brings something different to the role			2
" i realize that i 'm a role model , and so i feel more of a responsibility to give back to other women who are facing similar challenges			0
" her advice ? " follow your gut			0
a lot of women have very good intuition but they second guess themselves			0
the first answer is not always the right answer but it 's usually a very good directional , correct answer			2
" you have to imagine success and work backwards			0
what are you going to do to make that be the outcome ? anything is possible , until it 's not			0
