editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor at @entity3 and director of the @entity5			1
he is editor of " unfinished business : closing the @entity7 in @entity8 " and author of " the trouble with black boys : and other reflections on @entity12			0
" @entity2 says @entity13 needs to be wary of alienating teachers who can be his allies on education reform			1
( @entity18 ) -- president @entity13 has made it clear from the earliest days of his presidency that he intended to make education a high priority for his administration			1
he reaffirmed that commitment tuesday when he addressed schoolchildren on the topic			0
in one of his first presidential addresses , he made a special appeal to students at risk of dropping out : " ... [ @entity32 ] ropping out of high school is no longer an option			0
it 's not just quitting on yourself , it 's quitting on your country , and this country needs and values the talents of every @entity40			2
" the president 's commitment to education is truly remarkable , considering the enormous array of policy challenges confronting the administration			1
from health care and the economic crisis , to global warming and the wars in @entity51 and @entity52 , the administration is beset by controversies that will not be easily resolved			0
the fact that the president and his education secretary , @entity56 , have not allowed education to be ignored or placed on the back burner says a great deal about their recognition of its central importance to our nation			1
however , as the administration navigates its way into the policy debates that are swirling over the future of education , it would be wise for it to proceed with caution			2
the administration has already staked out positions on a number of issues -- charter schools and merit pay for teachers being two of the big ones -- which run the risk of generating additional controversy in the polarized debates over how to reform education			1
if these issues and the stimulus money being made available under the @entity87 ( rtt ) program are not handled carefully , conflict and even paralysis are likely to ensue			0
the president may even inadvertently alienate an important core constituency that he will surely need in the years ahead -- public school teachers			1
the current policy debates over the direction of education are typically presented as battles between the reformers , led by school superintendents like @entity98 of @entity99 and @entity100 of @entity101 , and the defenders of the status quo , most often presented as the powerful teacher unions and other elements of the education establishment			0
while anyone familiar with the current debates knows that the differences between the two sides are real and profound , a protracted battle over the direction of education reform is not a good thing either for the administration or for those who genuinely want to see improvement in public education			1
instead of choosing sides , it would be wise for the administration to do all it can to find common ground between the opposing camps as it formulates new policy initiatives			0
for example , instead of requiring states to adopt some form of merit pay for teachers -- a measure to which both the teachers ' unions , the @entity130 and @entity132 , have already declared their opposition -- the administration could encourage states to adopt school - based formulas that reward increases in student achievement			1
this is similar , though not identical , to the approach taken in @entity99 , one that encourages collaboration among teachers and recognizes the importance of evidence that children are learning			2
similarly , rather than touting charter schools as the solution to public education , the administration should treat the best charters as models of innovation that provide educators with the flexibility to implement new strategies			1
this is a subtle but important distinction that has been lacking in many of the administration 's pronouncements about charter schools			1
unlike the public schools , many charter schools find ways to avoid serving the most disadvantaged students , and their teachers often work a longer day and longer school year without a contract			1
moreover , many of the best charters are subsidized by private philanthropists and are able to spend considerably more per pupil than traditional public schools			0
these facts should not be used to negate the accomplishments of the excellent charter schools that have emerged in many large cities			1
in fact , it is far more likely that struggling public schools in these same cities would be more open to learning from the charters ' accomplishments if they were not cast as competitors			0
finally , the president has championed the idea of " promise neighborhoods " as a way to increase the availability of social services to children in high poverty communities , using as a model the @entity192			0
if this initiative is to result in lasting benefits to children , it will need to be combined with creative approaches to reforming urban public schools that re-formulate how we think about standards and focus attention more intently on how to deliver quality instruction to children			0
with dropout rates at over 50 percent in several of our nation 's cities , the administration must realize that tinkering at the margins with @entity208 will not deliver the change we need			0
the president entered office promising to bring a new kind of politics to the nation , an approach that focused on finding common ground among diverse constituencies to solve the pressing problems of our time			0
in areas like health care , energy , the economy and foreign policy , this new approach has not yet gained traction			0
however , it is not too late for the president to unite the nation around a common effort to improve public education			2
for this to happen , he will need to keep above the fray and stay focused on a strategy that sends a clear message to all constituencies that working together to improve public education is in our national interest			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : it 's good that @entity13 is *emphasizing* education 's importance
he says president needs to be wary of taking sides on *volatile* issues
he says merit pay and charter schools could alienate key allies
@entity2 : @entity13 needs teachers on his side to improve schools
