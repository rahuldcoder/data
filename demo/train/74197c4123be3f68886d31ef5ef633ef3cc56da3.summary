wearing a sheer leopard top , @entity0 buzzed around her beauty salon in @entity3			1
she decided six months ago to open this little shop , paint its walls seafoam green and call it @entity6			1
" everybody told me you are crazy ! starting a business now ? " she said			2
" but i thought i should try , and it worked quite well ! " @entity0 's hair fell in gelled tendrils around her cheerful face			1
her eyes were done up glamorously in a cat - eye			1
is n't it strange , running a salon in the middle of a war ? " i think life goes on , " she replied			1
" in the beginning , everyone was so sad , but little by little , everyone got used to it			2
" for more than a year and a half , the story of @entity28 has been told in bodies and bombs			2
an estimated 28,000 people have died since march 2011 when demonstrators , inspired by @entity35 uprisings in @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , began rallying for a freer country			2
they wanted president @entity40 , who had essentially inherited power from his long - ruling family , gone			1
@entity43 cracked down on protesters , claiming " terrorists " were attacking the country and blocked most foreign media ( or at least made reporting in @entity28 a life - risking enterprise )			1
the media have depended largely on accounts from rebels fighting @entity40 or @entity40 's own state - run media , the occasional on - the - ground human rights worker or internet videos @entity28 have posted , which are very difficult to vet			1
nearly all of it has been about death and misery			2
none of it has looked like @entity6 or the surprisingly vibrant scene @entity62 experienced during a recent and rare visit to @entity3			1
the scene in many parts of this city , home to more than 2 million , was far less bloody than expected			2
people were shopping , walking along crowded streets and going to their jobs			2
women were getting their nails done			1
@entity28 says @entity3 suburbs ' cleansed ' ; 57 reported dead nationwide " we are trying to have a normal life , to live like we usually do , " said @entity74 as an @entity76 manicurist lacquered her nails red			1
" but inside us , it 's not the same , " she said			1
" it will never be the same			2
" she and @entity0 say the same thing			2
they feel stuck in the middle			2
" i 'm not part of any side , " the salon owner said			2
" it makes it very difficult because nowadays you can not be in the middle			2
" before , people would just talk to each other			2
now , you ca n't have a simple conversation without someone asking first , " are you with the government or against the government ? " " ' are you with or against us ? ' " @entity0 mimicked			2
" it has become really funny			2
" @entity74 wore jeans and crossed her petite legs			2
a fashionable chunky necklace complemented her casual green button - up			1
her full , blond hair framed her face			2
she looked sad but smiled as she politely answered a reporter 's questions			1
how has life changed ? " when we see the people , the people who are living in the streets ... the homes that are gone ... everything makes us unhappy , " she said			1
" even the jobs , ( they are ) not like in the past			0
" she keeps trying to explain			0
for instance , she offers , she still goes to restaurants			0
but now she 's mindful to leave well before dusk arrives			1
you have to go home early , she said , because nobody wants to be outside , just in case			0
shells are falling , but where , no one can predict			0
@entity74 moved her children to a school close to home , fearing for their safety on the 30 - minute drive to a better school on the edge of @entity3			1
" how do you explain it ? my little boy , he does n't understand really what 's happening , " she said			1
" but my daughter ... she understands what 's happening			1
" we can lie to them			0
we have to say what is happening , but we ( do n't ) say the people die			0
" she tells them : there is a bad situation in the country			0
the first time @entity0 heard shelling , she was with one of her young sons			0
" @entity154 , we start making joke that it 's a water pipe sound , " she said			1
she felt kind of guilty about kidding around			0
" i know it 's really bad because people are dying ... for nothing ! " she said			1
for nothing this goes on ! " @entity74 likes to think things will get better			0
" we hope ... everything will be good , " she says , her voice straining			0
not far from the salon , in a middle - class neighborhood near the center of the city , another woman , a pharmacist , is doing brisk business			1
her shelves are well - stocked			1
she 's afraid of reprisals from the rebels and asked not to be named			1
she looks like she 's in her 50s			1
her make - up is soft and her hair is pulled back the way that women who are very busy style it			1
she wears a white lab coat			0
her female assistant wears the same , a white hijab covers her hair entirely			0
business is down maybe 30 % , the pharmacist said , but that 's mostly because customers are n't buying as many cosmetics and creams anymore			1
" we sell too much medicine for anti-stress , depression , sleeping pills , " she said			0
" yes , we sell too much now			0
" she 's asked how she feels about @entity40			1
she says she supports the president			0
fighting in @entity28 is a " game " involving " big countries " such as @entity197 and the @entity198 , she believes			0
there are " many hands outside " @entity28 that are responsible for the violence			0
she does n't think @entity40 is to blame			0
he 's a young man , " she said , echoing a sentiment some @entity28 have expressed about 47 - year - old @entity40			1
they see -- or , at least , saw -- his youth as a sign of modernity and progressivism			0
since taking power in 2000 , @entity40 has been praised for opening @entity28 's market to the oil sector			1
he did open the country to foreign investment and introduced private banking			0
but in tandem with these advances , @entity28 's record on human rights was consistently abysmal			1
people were imprisoned for political reasons			0
the government blocked access intermittently to the internet between 2008 and 2011			0
" maybe there is problem in our regime , but all regimes in countries over the world , they have problems , " the pharmacist said			0
" @entity40 has improved @entity28 over the past several years			0
we have everything new in the country			0
we have many things -- private university , private banks , private schools , @entity223			0
" @entity0 also longs for the way life seemed before the violence			1
" we have a lot of freedoms as a woman in @entity28 , " she said			1
" i used to walk 3 a.m. at night and nobody would disturb me			0
i would travel to another ( village ) at night and not ( be ) worried			0
now i can not go to the countryside without the army stopping me			0
" they always ask : which side are you on ? " what answer should i give ? ! " she says			0
the rebels and @entity40 's forces should stop fighting			1
" i say , very bold , ' stop it ! ' " @entity0 insisted			0
" what the hell we are doing ? where did we get ourselves to ? " @entity261 warns @entity28 future attacks ' will be silenced '			0

in the *capital* @entity3 , life in some neighborhoods seems normal
women get their nails done , customers shop at a well - stocked pharmacy
" we are trying to have a normal life , " one woman says , " but inside us , it 's not the same "
