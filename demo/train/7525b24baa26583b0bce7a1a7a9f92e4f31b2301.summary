-- changing winter conditions are causing @entity4 's wild @entity3 sheep to get smaller , according to a study that suggests climate change can trump natural selection			1
ca n't see me now : climate change could be shrinking @entity3 sheep in @entity4			1
the authors of the study published in " science " believe that it highlights how wide - ranging the effects of global climate change can be , adding further complexity to the changes we might expect to see in animal populations in future			1
" it 's only in the last few years that we 've realized that evolution can influence species ' physical traits as quickly as ecological changes can			0
this study addresses one of the major goals of population biology , namely to untangle the ways in which evolutionary and environmental changes influence a species ' traits , " said @entity28 , deputy and international managing editor at @entity13			2
the researchers analyzed body - weight measurements and life - history data for the female members of a population of @entity3 sheep			1
the sheep live on the island of hirta in the @entity46 archipelago of @entity4 and have been studied closely since 1985			1
they selected body size because it is a heritable trait , and because the sheep have , on average , been decreasing in size for the last 25 years			2
according to the findings lambs are not growing as quickly as they once did as winters have become shorter so do not need to put on as much as weight in the first months of life to survive			0
the results suggest that the decrease is primarily an ecological response to environmental variation over the last 25 years			0
evolutionary change , the report says , has contributed relatively little			2
" @entity61 are getting smaller			0
well , at least the wild soay sheep living on a remote @entity4 island are			1
but according to classic evolutionary theory , they should have been getting bigger , because larger sheep tend to be more likely to survive and reproduce than smaller ones , and offspring tend to resemble their parents , " said study author @entity64 of @entity65			2
" our findings have solved a paradox that has tormented biologists for years -- why predictions did not match observation			0
biologists have realized that ecological and evolutionary processes are intricately intertwined , and they now have a way of dissecting out the contribution of each			0
unfortunately it is too early to tell whether a warming world will lead to pocket - sized sheep , " said @entity64 .			0

study of wild sheep in @entity4 suggests climate change making them smaller
authors of report suggest that climate change can *override* natural selection
