-- all - conquering rally champion @entity1 has told @entity0 that it is " too late " for him to consider a career switch to @entity5			1
the @entity6 , who has broken every record in the off - track motorsport in clinching a seventh consecutive world title this season , had his dreams dashed late last year when he was refused a licence to drive in @entity5			1
" i do n't think it 's potential for the future , " @entity1 told @entity14 's @entity13 when asked if still had any ambitions to drive in @entity5			1
" the story about @entity5 started because @entity19 gave me the opportunity to test after my title in 2008 , and everyone was very surprised that i was close to the times			1
" that gave the idea to @entity19 to make me drive in a race [ in 2009 for feeder team @entity27 ] , and finally at the last everything was planned to do the last race of the season and the @entity31 did n't give me the licence for that			1
blog : @entity36 win ushers in new era " now i 'm 36 years old and when you see some young drivers coming in , they 're 20 years old , so maybe 's it 's a bit too late			2
if i have the opportunities to drive a @entity5 car , for sure i will take it , but i 've got no plan to do a career in that			2
" @entity1 bounced back from that disappointment to take out his frustrations on his rally rivals this year , clinching another crown in his hometown of @entity53 early last month			1
" it was really special for me			0
a few years ago i could n't expect to have a rally in my hometown , " he said			0
" now i had it this year and i finally won the rally and the championship in the same place , so for sure it was a lot of emotion and a great atmosphere , a really good rally			2
there were a lot of fans , my family was here and my friends , so it was really good			0
" @entity1 has dominated the @entity72 with @entity73 , having won a record 64 races ahead of this weekend 's season - ending event in @entity77 , @entity78			1
he claimed his first victory in @entity80 in 2002 and was then championship runner - up by just one point the following year as @entity73 made a fulltime entry to the competition			2
so how does he maintain motivation after sweeping all behind him in the past seven years ? " my motivation is just because i like what i do			0
i enjoy driving , i enjoy the fight and the competition			0
my goal next year will be to get another title , " @entity1 said			1
he revealed , however , that he is getting near the end of his rally career			0
it 's on my mind , yes , but when i do n't know			0
i will drive next year , that 's the plan			0
for the future , i have no idea at the moment , i will drive as long as i am motivated			0
and for the future i will maybe have some other plans , but not specially in @entity5			2
