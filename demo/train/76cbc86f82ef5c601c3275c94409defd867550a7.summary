editor 's note : @entity2 founded @entity3 , a site featuring multicultural political commentary , hosts a nationally syndicated @entity6 - language radio show ; and wrote a guide to success for immigrants ( " @entity10 ! " published by @entity11 )			1
he is co-founder and president of @entity13 , an advocacy marketing agency based in @entity14 , @entity15			2
@entity2 says people hold on to their views despite the evidence for fear of being labeled a flip - flopper			1
@entity14 , @entity15 ( @entity21 ) -- as people shout over each other and tune out diverging views in town hall meetings , the health care debate is proving to be symptomatic of a major ailment threatening our nation : a contagious culture of closed - mindedness threatens to suffocate our progress as a society			2
why has it become so difficult to even consider changing our minds about important issues ? here 's my diagnosis			1
increasingly , the willingness to change one 's position on political issues has been misread as a mark of weakness rather than a product of attentive listening and careful deliberation			1
during the 2004 presidential campaign , the successful branding of @entity49 as a flip - flopper doomed his bid			0
fear of " flip - flopper syndrome " is apparently catching like the flu , because today politicians are not alone in their determination to adhere to partisan positions despite the changing needs of our nation			0
nearly everyone 's so reluctant to appear wishy - washy that they stand firm even when the evidence is against their views			1
three factors exacerbate this paralysis by lack of analysis : labels , lifestyles and listening			1
first , the labels ascribed to many potential policy tools render sensible options taboo , loading what could be rational , economic or social measures with moral baggage			1
this narrows our choices , hemming in policy makers			1
any proposal including the words " government - run " elicits cries of " socialism " and " communism			1
" any argument invoking the words " @entity90 " or " moral " sparks accusations of " right - wing extremism , " " fascism , " or " bible - thumping			1
" instead of listening to each other 's ideas , we spot the warning label and run the other way			1
second , our lifestyles favor knee - jerk reactions			0
the way we think , work and live in the @entity103 demands we quickly categorize information without investing time into rich interaction , research and understanding			0
we 're hesitant to ask questions because we do n't have time to listen to the long , complicated answers that might follow			2
and we lack the time to fact - check competing claims			0
in our haste , it 's easier to echo our party 's position than drill down , questioning whether party leaders are motivated by our best interests or the best interests of their biggest contributors			2
third , we tend to listen only to like - minded opinions as media fragmentation encourages us to filter out varying perspectives			2
if you 're a liberal , you avoid @entity126			0
if you 're a conservative you revile @entity128			0
the dynamic is even more pronounced online , where a niche media source can be found for any outlook			0
this silences the opportunity for meaningful dialogue and deliberation that might lead to reformulating positions , forging sustainable compromises , and developing consensus crucial to moving our nation forward on complex issues			2
so how can we overcome this challenge , starting with the health care debate ? how do we open our minds to the possibility that we could actually learn from somebody else ? here 's my prescription			1
for starters , we should eschew the notion that changing our minds is a character flaw			0
to the contrary , experts believe it 's a manifestation of higher intelligence			2
renowned psychologist @entity160 wrote in " @entity161 , " his seminal 1992 book : " the willingness to change one 's mind in the light of new evidence is a sign of rationality not weakness			1
" to further free our minds , we should aggressively treat the three @entity168 : let 's lose the labels : from " flip - flopper " to " commie , " from " fear - monger " to " right - wing nut job			1
" trash the diatribe ; mull the ideas			0
let 's engage in some constructive lifestyle management , slowing down to ponder -- and make independent decisions -- as enlightened people			2
we can not allow the technological evolution to rob us of the intellectual strides of the @entity183			0
we must value the art of listening , reflection , comparative analysis , and civil discourse if we 're to make the most of our democracy			0
in the process , we should signal to leaders that we 're willing to expand our horizons beyond party lines			0
maybe they 'll get in front of our parade , collaborating for a change			0
let 's request a second opinion and listen to each other			1
read a newspaper , while we can still find one			0
how about stepping into a town hall with an open mind , prepared to converse with people hailing from diverse circumstances ? a range of perspectives enriches our viewpoint , empowering us to craft nuanced responses to complex situations			1
ultimately , we must stop thinking that the only thing to think is what we 've thought all along			0
as we learn more about multifaceted matters , our positions should evolve accordingly			0
let 's accept that it 's ok to change your minds			2
in the end , opening our minds can only enhance the prognosis for our most cherished patient : @entity227			0

@entity2 : it 's become *unfashionable* to have an open mind about issues
he says labels like " socialism " and " fascism " *obscure* the real choices
he says it 's a sign of rationality to be open to the evidence
@entity2 : let 's listen to each other and take into consideration wider range of viewpoints
