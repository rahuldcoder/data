the agency is thought to be among the nation 's largest municipal developers of low - to mid-income housing			2
" @entity20 basically runs the recovery process , " the president said			2
" it does n't focus on the rebuilding			0
for that , we 've got to have all government agencies involved			0
" he addressed reporters beside gov. @entity29 and mayor @entity28 in hard - hit @entity30 , where more than half of @entity0 's 43 storm deaths occurred			1
@entity2 also toured @entity33 , where a tidal surge and heavy winds lashed homes and businesses and rendered much of the region without power			1
" we are going to be here until the rebuilding is complete , " he said			0

more complete repairs will come later , @entity73 said			0
