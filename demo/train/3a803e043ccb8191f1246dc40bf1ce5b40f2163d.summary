president @entity0 and congressional leaders described similar proposals tuesday for ending the @entity4 's sweeping collection of bulk telephone records			1
@entity0 told reporters in @entity7 that his intelligence team gave him a " workable " option for @entity4 reform that he said would " eliminate " concerns about how the government keeps the records known as metadata			1
at a news conference in @entity18 , the leaders of the @entity16 said they worked out their own bipartisan compromise on a similar proposal intended to alleviate what they characterized as unfounded fears of excessive government surveillance			0
the nearly simultaneous remarks demonstrated progress toward @entity0 's call in january for @entity4 changes in the aftermath of last year 's classified leaks by former agency contractor @entity31 that revealed the magnitude of surveillance programs created in response to the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
congressional battle coming however , the issue touches on deep political and ideological fissures between @entity39 and @entity40 , promising an extended battle in @entity42 over the necessary legislation -- especially in an election year			1
a senior administration official told @entity46 that the @entity48 plan , first reported by @entity49 , would ensure " the government no longer collects or holds " the telephone metadata -- records that include the numbers and time of calls , but no content such as the actual conversation			1
according to the official , the proposal " still ensures that the government has access to the information it needs " for national security purposes			0
the official declined to specify where the bulk phone metadata would ultimately be stored			0
now it is collected by the @entity4 under broad legal authority to keep it for five years			2
it was not immediately clear how the @entity48 proposal differed from the compromise announced by @entity69			1
@entity70 of @entity71 and @entity72 of @entity73 -- the top @entity39 and @entity74 on the @entity16			0
their plan would end the automatic @entity4 collection of phone metadata , with telecommunications companies keeping such records for at least 18 months -- as they do now			1
court approval two layers of court approval would be needed to access the records -- one for the overall surveillance program seeking the information , and another for the specific foreign phone number being investigated , the legislators said			0
the @entity31 leaks unleashed a political firestorm , with privacy advocates and others calling the @entity4 surveillance programs a violation of constitutional rights			1
in particular , many @entity96 feared inevitable abuse of a system in which the government collected billions of phone records for possible review in terrorism investigations			0
@entity31 , now living in @entity103 while seeking asylum from @entity96 prosecution , has repeatedly described the surveillance programs illuminated by his leaks as unconstitutional			0
several legal challenges have been mounted against the @entity4 programs , and some of those cases could reach the @entity111 in coming years to set up a judicial review of the constitutional limits of government surveillance in the post 9/11 era			2
@entity0 and the two @entity48 legislators all said tuesday the current system was legal , but needed changing to reassure a skeptical public @entity0 : " people were concerned " in @entity120 , @entity0 argued that " clear safeguards " exist against " some of the dangers that people hypothesize when it came to bulk data			1
" " but i recognize that people were concerned about what might happen in the future with that bulk data , " he said			0
" this proposal that 's been presented to me would eliminate that concern			0
" @entity70 argued no abuses occurred under the present system , but he acknowledged public concern about the possibility of problems down the road if the government kept such vast stores of information			0
" that 's really what we 're trying to do here is alleviate that concern that there could be abuse in the future of these programs , " he said			0
authorization for the current @entity4 programs expires on friday , and @entity0 will seek a temporary renewal until @entity42 passes reform legislation , the senior administration official said			1
news of the proposed changes came during @entity0 's trip to @entity158 , where he 's mobilizing support for isolating @entity103 over its military occupation and annexation of @entity162 from @entity163			2
@entity31 's leaks put the @entity4 's surveillance activities under global scrutiny			2
the revelations included @entity96 spying on @entity158 allies and others , sparking diplomatic protests			0
nine months of negotiations in january , @entity0 outlined a series of steps -- some immediate and some requiring time to work out , possibly with @entity42 -- that would change aspects of the @entity4 collection of phone records and other information but generally leave intact the core and function of existing programs			1
@entity70 and @entity72 said tuesday that nine months of negotiations involving the intelligence community and other stakeholders led to their proposed legislation			2
the @entity48 was involved in the discussions , @entity72 said , while @entity70 noted the @entity0 proposal came out after the committee shared its plan with the @entity48 earlier this week			1
he noted that more work remains to be done to narrow differences with the @entity48 and the @entity193			2
" we 're feeling pretty good about people starting to coalesce around a solution , " @entity70 said , adding that " there will be people who are married to their own positions			0
" initial reaction to the @entity48 plan included praise with some caution			2
step forward @entity40 sen. @entity203 of @entity204 , a leading critic of the @entity4 surveillance programs , said news of the @entity48 plan amounted to an executive branch retreat			1
" for years , the executive branch said it was essential to have this information , that it was indispensable , " @entity203 said , noting he and colleagues argued against that notion			2
" today 's exciting news for the constitutional rights of the @entity96 people is the administration said they agree with us			0
" @entity218 , legislative counsel for the @entity219 , called the reported @entity48 plan " a crucial first step towards reining in the @entity4 's overreaching surveillance			1
" " the change would replace the dragnet surveillance of millions of innocent people with targeted methods that are both effective and respect @entity96 ' constitutional rights , " @entity218 said , adding : " it is critical that the administration also end other bulk collection programs			0
