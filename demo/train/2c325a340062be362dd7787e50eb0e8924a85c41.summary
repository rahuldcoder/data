why is @entity0 scared of 24 - year - old @entity1 ? what have his people done to her ? why wo n't they let her family contact her ? @entity7 @entity1 , the @entity8 artist and activist who leads the provocatively named punk rock band @entity10 , was thrown into a car by @entity8 prison authorities three weeks ago , according to @entity13			1
after an international campaign , including an @entity13 petition , the office of the @entity8 ombudsman now says that authorities have confirmed suspicions that she is on her way to a prison camp in @entity23 , thousands of miles away from her husband and her small daughter , with an orwellian claim that the move aims to " promote her resocialization			1
" @entity1 and @entity10 became a thorn in @entity0 's side with their performance pieces , when they wore the colorful face - covering balaclavas that became their trademark , and launched into routines that were clearly meant to outrage			1
their work had a cutting political message			0
imprisoned @entity10 band member transferred to another prison she and her band , you may remember , got into serious legal trouble early last year after they staged a flash - mob style performance of their " @entity49 " at @entity53 's main @entity8 @entity52 cathedral , chanting " virgin mary , mother of god , put @entity0 away			1
" it was a protest against the church 's support for @entity0 's increasingly controversial rule			1
the video quickly had millions of viewings			0
within days , the performers were arrested and charged with " hooliganism motivated by religious hatred			0
" @entity1 , along with her @entity10 colleague @entity64 , was sentenced to two years in prison			1
she is scheduled to be released in march , but experience has shown that in @entity69 , the government can find ways to delay a prisoner 's release practically forever , if that is what it chooses			1
just ask @entity75 , the once - wealthy businessman who became a @entity0 critic			2
while he was already imprisoned in @entity23 , the government brought new charges against him , piling more years to his incarceration			2
as with @entity75 , @entity80 has turned @entity1 into a symbol of state repression and proof that the government can not tolerate dissent or criticism			1
every day she is out of sight , the @entity8 government looks more frightened of its own people , more eager to suppress freedom of expression and more comfortable violating human rights			0
that is definitely not a good look for a country preparing to host the world in the @entity97			0
clearly , the tactics of @entity1 's @entity10 are not to everyone 's taste			1
some find them deeply offensive			0
but the state 's ferocious response to the actions of a group of young activists was hardly warranted by the scale of their transgressions			0
authorities started by holding them without bail and compiling an indictment that ran almost 3,000 pages			0
their lawyers were given two days to review the material , prompting the defendants to go on hunger strike to protest the unfairness of the proceedings			0
@entity1 is a political prisoner			2
and now , in the worst tradition of @entity69 , @entity1 , a musician , wife and mother , has been thrown into @entity69 's @entity127 system			1
the timing of @entity1 's disappearance helps explain its motivation			1
the government is punishing her and her family and trying to intimidate her because , incredibly , even in prison she has not stopped pointing out the excesses of the regime			1
on september 23 , she went on a hunger strike to protest the brutal conditions experienced by her and her fellow prisoners at the infamous women 's prison camp in @entity141			2
before she started her hunger strike , she wrote a letter explaining the reasons for her protest			0
" when they send you off to @entity141 , " she wrote , " it is as though you 're headed to the scaffold			0
" she described the sadistic punishments , the unceasing slave labor ; the horrors of daily life			0
she told the story of a woman who was beaten to death in the third unit , " the third , " she explained , " is the pressure unit where they put prisoners that need to undergo daily beatings			0
" the women , she said , work 17 hours a day with four hours of sleep and a day off every month and a half			0
the administration views the prisoners as free labor for the mass manufacturing of police uniforms , she noted , asking pointedly , " where does the money they get for them go ? " even from prison @entity1 was able to rattle the system			1
her critique of the prison system made waves , even as her health declined			2
after 10 days on hunger strike she was transferred to the prison hospital			0
when she stopped the strike , expecting to be moved to a more humane prison , she was returned to the same labor camp and she restarted her hunger strike			0
in @entity69 's dismal prison system , the family 's material and psychological support can make the difference between life and death			1
but while a prisoner is being transferred , the government has no responsibility to inform relatives of their whereabouts			0
prison authorities say @entity1 is in transit , on her way to a new facility			1
her husband , @entity205 , says he had good reason to believe his wife is being sent to a prison colony deep inside @entity23 , probably the worst place on @entity210 to spend the winter			2
b there is reason to fear for her health , after her lengthy hunger strike , and to worry about how she is being treated by correctional authorities			0
the country 's human rights ombudsman , @entity218 , says he has been told by prison officials that she is in " satisfactory " health , in transit to a new prison			2
by its vindictive treatment of @entity1 and its efforts to frighten her into submission , the @entity8 government is turning someone who would have been a fairly obscure activist into a major international figure , and in the process it is shining a light on the very abuses to which she wants to draw attention			1
this may be ultimately good for the @entity8 people , but it is exceedingly dangerous for @entity1			2
@entity69 is a place where government critics have faced mysterious and tragic endings			2
it is not a moment too soon for the @entity0 government to show @entity1 , to show it is treating her humanely , and to make good on its word to release her as soon as her current sentence expires .			1

@entity245 : @entity1 , jailed @entity10 activist , has vanished
@entity13 says she was taken from prison in car ; family does n't know where she is , she says
@entity253 : her band , and @entity0 regime 's *crackdown* on it , shone light on @entity69 's repression
@entity253 : it 's feared she 's in @entity23 , her health at risk . @entity69 making her an icon
