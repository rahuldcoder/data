@entity0 , @entity1 -- the most powerful leaders at @entity4 showed " total and consistent disregard " for child sex abuse victims while covering up the attacks of a longtime sexual predator , according to an internal review into how the school handled a scandal involving its former assistant football coach			0
investigators conducted more than 400 interviews and found that several officials had " empowered " @entity17 to continue his abuse , while @entity19 , the school 's legendary head football coach , could have stopped the attacks had he done more , investigators said thursday			1
read the report here ( @entity24 ) in a scandal that has shaken @entity1 residents and gripped the nation , leading to @entity19 's dismissal and the ouster of longtime president @entity30 , @entity31 , the former @entity32 director who led the review , said top university officials forged an agreement to conceal @entity17 's sexual attacks more than a decade ago			1
" there are more red flags here than you can count , " said @entity31 , emphasizing the abuse occurred just " steps away " from where @entity19 worked in the university 's @entity39			1
@entity31 's 267 - page report is the product of a @entity4 - funded investigation , which is separate from a government investigation into charges of perjury and failure to report abuse pinned against the school 's former athletic director @entity52 and @entity55 president @entity54			1
the @entity1 attorney general 's office is investigating what @entity4 knew about a 2001 incident of child sex abuse by @entity17 , reported by then - graduate assistant @entity60 , and how it was handled			1
neither @entity60 , @entity17 nor @entity19 -- who died in january -- were interviewed by @entity31 's team and no trial date has been set for @entity52 and @entity63 , though proceedings are expected to begin later in july			1
the prosecution of @entity52 and @entity63 comes on the heels of the widely watched @entity17 trial , in which the former defensive coordinator was convicted of sexually abusing young boys over 15 years			2
" our most saddening and sobering finding is the total disregard for the safety and welfare of @entity17 's child victims by the most senior leaders at @entity4 , " @entity31 wrote			1
" the most powerful men at @entity4 failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who @entity17 victimized			2
" reactions to @entity4 report flood social media he blamed @entity30 , @entity63 , @entity19 and @entity52 for having " never demonstrated ... any concern for the safety and well - being of @entity17 's victims until after @entity17 's arrest , " while the board of trustees failed to perform their oversight duties			1
that collective failure " to protect against a child sexual predator harming children " lasted " more than a decade , " and allowed @entity17 to further harm his victims , the full report says			2
key passages from the report see @entity31 's prepared statement here ( @entity24 ) trustee @entity99 , head of the committee addressing the @entity17 scandal , said the school 's board of trustees is " deeply ashamed " of its lack of oversight identified in the report			1
he said the board 's 32 members -- none of whom plan to resign -- as well as university administrators are accountable for what happened			2
he pledged corrective measures to ensure that an " event like this can never happen again in the @entity4 community			0
" @entity117 , trustees chairwoman , said " 61 years of excellent service that @entity19 ( @entity119 ) gave to the community is now marred			1
" @entity31 's report outlined a culture of secrecy at top university levels , noting an incident in which janitors aware of the abuse took no action , out of fear			0
" they witness what i think in the report is probably the most horrific rape that 's described , " @entity31 told reporters			0
" and what do they do ? they panic			0
" one janitor , a @entity137 veteran , said it was " the worst thing he 's ever seen			0
" he and other janitors were " alarmed and shocked , " but were afraid that if they reported it they 'd be fired			0
@entity145 at center of @entity4 probe , 26 years after young woman 's murder attorneys for @entity52 and @entity63 said @entity31 did not have access to critical witnesses and came up with an incomplete report			2
@entity52 's attorney termed it a " lopsided document that leaves the majority of the story untold			0
" " a complete record can and will be made in a court of law , aided by the power of subpoena , where all of the witnesses are subject to thorough cross-examination , " attorney @entity159 said in a statement			0
@entity167 , @entity63 's attorney , said at trial the jury will learn that @entity60 never told his client that he witnessed @entity17 engaging in anal sex with a boy			1
evidence will show @entity63 did not have secret files on @entity17 and that there was no effort among the four leaders to conceal @entity17 's behavior , @entity167 said in a statement			1
attorneys for @entity30 and @entity17 did not immediately respond to @entity2 's requests for comment			1
the review casts a shadow over the school 's storied football program and over the career of @entity19 , who was widely beloved for bringing @entity4 football to national prominence			1
@entity119 , son of the former head football coach , told @entity2 contributor @entity191 , reporting for @entity193 , that " we wish ( @entity19 had ) been more aggressive in following up			1
" " but clearly he thought it had been handled , " he said , referring to the 2001 report of @entity17 's abuse of a minor			1
" there was n't anything more @entity19 could have done because it was an unsubstantiated allegation , " the younger @entity19 said			2
" i know my father did not know @entity17 was a pedophile and did not suspect he was a pedophile			1
" another @entity19 son , @entity201 , told @entity2 's " @entity206 " that sworn testimony ate - the @entity63 and @entity52 trials will provide information that will help give the whole picture			1
@entity207 also said people should realize there is much more information available on @entity17 's acts today than there was in 2001			1
at a glance : key players in @entity4 report @entity31 's team discovered accusations of @entity17 's abuse well over a decade ago , which school officials were allegedly aware of			1
even before the 1998 investigation , " several staff members and football coaches regularly observed @entity17 showering with young boys , " and none of those interviewed ever notified their superiors , the report found			2
a year later , in 1999 , @entity19 , @entity30 , @entity63 and @entity52 decided to allow @entity17 to retire , " not as a suspected child predator , but as a valued member of the @entity4 football legacy , " the report says			1
that allowed him to continue to work with children at the university , " essentially granting him license to bring boys to campus facilities for ' grooming ' as targets for his assaults			0
" he retained unlimited access to university facilities until november 2011 , the report says			2
the school also approved a one - time lump sum payment of $ 168,000 to @entity17 in 1999			2
top university officials said they had never known @entity4 " to provide this type of payment to a retiring employee			0
" @entity4 community still admires @entity19 the desire to avoid bad publicity was part of administrators ' rationale in the cover - up , investigators said thursday			2
victim no. 6 : violation and vindication " no one , no one , is above scrutiny , " said @entity99 when the review began in november 2011			0
video : @entity264 part of @entity19 legacy in june , eight young men testified , often in disturbingly graphic detail , of how @entity17 forced them to engage in sexual acts in various places , including hotel rooms , the basement of his home and in the @entity4 coaches ' locker room			1
in court documents , prosecutors say they have e-mails from university officials -- which @entity2 obtained exclusively -- that allegedly contradict grand jury testimony of @entity52 and @entity63			0
the @entity31 review discovered the documents and turned them over to state prosecutors as part of ongoing investigations , according to both the university and prosecutors			0
one of the e-mails suggests @entity19 had a previously undisclosed conversation with @entity52 about the shower room incident from 2001			0
@entity31 's team of investigators said evidence shows @entity19 was also made aware of a criminal investigation of @entity17 relating to suspected sexual misconduct with a boy years earlier			1
but @entity19 " failed to take any action , " the report found			0
" at the very least , mr. @entity19 could have alerted the entire football staff , in order to prevent @entity17 from bringing another child into the @entity39 , " where the incident took place			1
@entity19 and the others also failed to alert the board of trustees , @entity31 said			1
" none of them even spoke to @entity17 about his conduct			0
in short , nothing was done and @entity17 was allowed to continue with impunity			0
" then , in february 2001 , the four men decided they would report the incident to the @entity313 ; but @entity19 had a conversation with @entity52 , and the men then agreed not to do so , @entity31 wrote			0
despite scandal , @entity4 rakes in millions in donations " after giving it more thought and talking it over with @entity19 yesterday , i am uncomfortable with what we agreed were the next steps , " @entity52 wrote the next day , according to @entity31 's report			2
instead of alerting authorities , @entity52 apparently wrote that he would prefer meeting with @entity17 , telling him they knew about another incident in 1998 and offering him professional help			0
he then suggested notifying @entity17 's @entity330 charity organization " at some point " if @entity17 is cooperative , and " maybe " child welfare officials			2
@entity19 never reported the shower incident to police			0
" to his credit , mr. @entity19 stated on november 9 , 2011 , ' with the benefit of hindsight , i wish i had done more			0
" we determined that his decision to do his minimum legal duty and not to do more to follow - up constituted a failure of leadership by @entity19 , " the board of trustees said in a report that explained his firing			1
that decision prompted rioting by @entity4 students , who overturned a news van and clashed with police , who used tear gas to break up throngs of angry protesters			0
video : coach k on @entity19 @entity356 , a lawyer for the @entity19 family , said the former head coach " followed university procedures and promptly and fully informed his superiors			0
" @entity30 , the ousted president , has consistently maintained that he was never informed of any incident involving @entity17 that described sexual abuse or criminality			0
according to the board of trustees , @entity30 was fired in november because " he failed to meet his leadership responsibilities			0
" @entity19 defended football , @entity4 in letter before his death @entity2 's @entity371 and @entity372 contributed to this report			2

@entity19 son says more information will come out later
