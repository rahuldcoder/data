-- " how do you write to a family that your own father hurt so much ? " @entity4 , son of the infamous @entity6 drug lord @entity5 , posed this question in a letter to the families of two of his father 's most prominent victims			1
@entity13 was @entity6 's justice minister in the early 1980s and one of the first to aggressively pursue cocaine traffickers			1
he was murdered in 1984			0
six years later , @entity16 was a presidential candidate who publicly decried the drug cartels			0
he was assassinated during a campaign rally in 1989			0
@entity5 ordered both hits , according to authorities			2
one thing the drug lord and the public servants had in common is that they had children of roughly the same age			0
now grown , their children have embarked on a reconciliation effort that was impossible for their parents , thanks in part to a new documentary by @entity36 filmmaker @entity35			2
@entity38 's film , " @entity37 , " chronicles the path toward peace taken by the young men			1
@entity4 was breaking a silence of 16 years by being in the film			2
@entity4 , current @entity6 sen. @entity44 , @entity46 councilman @entity45 and sen. @entity13 spoke collectively to @entity47 about how they were brought together			1
the younger @entity49 and @entity50 followed their slain fathers ' footsteps into politics			0
@entity4 , who was born @entity54 , ran away from the path his father chose , changing his name once he and his mother left @entity6 , after @entity5 was killed in a rooftop shootout with authorities in 1993			1
" i learned many things from my father , " @entity4 says in the documentary			1
" the most important one was that if i want to live , i have to do the opposite of what he did			0
" until now , he has lived his life largely under the radar			0
it took @entity4 a lot of reflection and a lot of time to write the letter because he was fearful of offending the victims ' families			0
" it was a letter that really moved us , " @entity44 said			0
" we felt it was truly sincere , frank and transparent , and that this was a person who was honestly saying how he felt			0
" @entity50 , who was 8 years old when his father was assassinated , said he originally sought revenge for his father 's death			1
he still seeks justice for his father 's murder , but he has made peace with @entity5 's son			1
@entity4 asked for forgiveness for his father 's acts , for crimes that @entity4 did not commit , @entity50 said			1
true reconciliation comes from justice being served , @entity50 said			0
by cooperating in the film , his message to @entity6 is about the " need to break the country 's cycle of violence , " @entity50 said			2
" to forgive , one must remember , the other choice is to forget , " @entity50 said			0
putting himself in the spotlight could pose risks because of @entity5 's violent legacy , @entity4 said , but he hopes showing the reconciliation to the @entity6 public on the big screen will have a positive effect			1
" nothing is more important than peace , " @entity4 said			2
" i think it is worth it to really risk our lives and everything we have so that peace really happens in @entity6 someday			1

@entity5 's son @entity4 seeks reconciliation in documentary
he meets with sons of two men whose deaths are believed to have been on his father 's orders
one says he still seeks justice but he has made peace with @entity134
@entity4 : coming into spotlight is risky , but hope for peace in @entity6 is worth it
