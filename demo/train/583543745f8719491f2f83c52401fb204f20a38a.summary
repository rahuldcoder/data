after being smacked in the face by wave upon wave of sex abuse scandals for the past decade , it 's easy to feel nothing but angry or numb			1
so @entity7 's statue came down , a slew of dioceses went bankrupt , and thousands of once - secret documents about molesters in the @entity12 will soon be made public			0
it 's fair to ask : have we learned anything ? that makes it a good time to step back and look beyond individual villains to the big picture			0
when you put together the stories of @entity23 , the @entity24 , the @entity12 and other organizations hit by abuse scandals , you see they reacted in much the same way			1
their behavior was shocking , but it was more common than we knew			0
thanks to lawsuits and news reports , we now see this : for decades , some of our most trusted institutions -- from schools , camps and sports leagues to correctional facilities , foster care agencies and religious groups -- have inadvertently enabled child molesters at the expense of victims			1
while leaders in many youth - serving organizations have confronted the abuse problem head - on , others routinely erred on the side of molesters , ignored the extent of abuse in their ranks , hid abuse from authorities and misled the public			1
news : sex abuse files prompt calls for @entity63 ousters why ? to protect the good work of their organizations			1
they lost their perspective on where organizational protection ends and child protection begins			2
the @entity71 reflects this struggle as much as anyone			0
from 1971 - 1991 , the @entity12 banned more than 1,800 people for alleged sexual misconduct , according to its own " @entity76 , " made public in a lawsuit in the 1990s			0
those files reveal a well - intentioned effort to protect kids			1
but they also reveal a culture of silence that is typical of organizations that stumble over their abuse problem			1
time and again , @entity63 leaders tried to keep abuse incidents from legal authorities or the media : in @entity92 , a volunteer admitted to abusing a scout and agreed to resign " in return for no further legal action			1
" in @entity97 , @entity63 officials talked a victim 's parents out of contacting police , promising to " handle the situation " internally			1
they let the molester resign and he was arrested months later for abusing another boy			0
when a @entity107 scoutmaster was arrested for molesting three boys , a local scout executive worked with the chief of police to " do everything he could to keep this account out of the newspaper to protect the name of the @entity12			2
" new report accuses @entity12 of protecting child molesters the result was often disaster : first for kids , as molesters went on to abuse again , then for the organization , as victims eventually spoke up to lawyers and reporters			1
in this kind of clumsiness , however , the @entity71 has not been alone : schools : the most thorough national report on sex abuse in public schools in 2004 found that " when alleged misconduct is reported , the majority of complaints are ignored or disbelieved			1
" a 1990s study of 225 cases of " educator sexual misconduct " in @entity138 found that " all of the accused had admitted to sexual abuse of a student but none of the abusers was reported to authorities and only 1 percent lost their license to teach			2
" religious communities : the practice of keeping abuse allegations from secular authorities has a long tradition in several denominations besides the @entity24			2
some orthodox jewish communities are coming under increasing fire , through indictments and lawsuits , for pressuring families not to report allegations to authorities			2
when a family in @entity161 , @entity162 , ignored that pressure in 2009 , some rabbis circulated a proclamation that said , " it is prohibited ( for anyone ) to assist and participate with the secular authorities in their efforts to persecute a @entity169 person			0
" in @entity171 , the district attorney launched an initiative in 2009 to uncover abuse in orthodox jewish communities			2
similar tales of being pressured to " keep it in the house " are told in lawsuits by families in the @entity180 and @entity181			2
corrections : sexual assaults are rampant in juvenile correctional facilities			0
a 2010 report by the @entity187 @entity186 estimated that 12 % of young people in custody were sexually abused at their facilities in the past year			0
of that 12 % , 91 % were boys and the rest were girls			0
most of them were abused by staff , the very people who investigate abuse allegations			0
no wonder those allegations often go nowhere			0
just a few years ago @entity199 disbanded the @entity200 , the state agency that ran juvenile corrections , after investigators found that commission had largely dismissed and covered up hundreds of allegations of sex abuse			1
sports : former young swimmers and gymnasts allege in several recent criminal and civil complaints that they were abused by coaches , and that their complaints met with superficial inquiries at best			0
@entity214 , a 1972 @entity215 champion swimmer , said in a deposition when she reported her abuse : " most everyone i told in coaching gave me an answer that i felt was very vague and dismissive , that my coach was a great coach			0
" today , sex abuse victims are less alone the good news : the increased awareness brought on by lawsuits , indictments and news reports have driven a cultural shift in which kids are more likely to report abuse and to be believed			1
that shift has also compelled youth - serving organizations to significantly improve their procedures for preventing and reporting abuse			2
from national groups like the @entity12 to stand - alone after - school programs , most organizations run more thorough background checks on job and volunteer applicants ; better train their staff and youth about how to prevent and recognize abuse ; and enforce tighter procedures for reporting abuse			1
that 's the other side of the big picture : the victims are winning .			0
