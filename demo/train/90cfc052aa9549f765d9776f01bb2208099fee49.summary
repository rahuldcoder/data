-- with its purchase of @entity4 's mobile phone business , @entity1 has brought a longtime partner into the fold to help fight a battle that has been tough for both companies			1
@entity1 , which was late to the smartphone game with its @entity11 mobile operating system , badly trails @entity12 and @entity14 's @entity13			1
and while @entity4 is still a force selling feature phones worldwide , it 's barely made a dent in the smartphone market			1
but if the @entity22 company is struggling today , it can still take pride in its history at the forefront of the mobile movement			0
here are five ways the once - dominant phonemaker has helped shape the world of mobile electronics as we know it today : first to move it 's not the sort of thing that smartphone owners today probably remember -- if they 're even old enough			1
but the @entity37 , released in 1992 , was the first commercially available mobile phone that operated on what 's called the gsm network			1
the letters stand for @entity41			0
and what that meant was that unlike earlier phones , the @entity4 could be used to make a phone call from almost anywhere in the world			1
@entity41 is still the world 's most widely used mobile system , although @entity50 is expected eventually to replace it			1
phone as fashion statement a phone is just a phone , right ? of course not			0
today , there are plenty of folks who , admit it or not , wrap at least a small part of their identity up in what kind of phone is in their pocket			0
that was a pretty alien concept up until the early 2000s when , if you owned a cell phone , there was a pretty good chance it was a @entity4			2
remember those chunky , rounded models with the tiny gray screens and the nubby antennas ? the @entity72 was one of the most popular			0
and it also was one of the market 's first phones that had a replaceable face plate			0
the plates came in a wide variety of colors , offering one of the first chances to personalize your phone 's look			2
the ' slider ' the popularity of early @entity4 phones meant the company 's designs often became the standard for cell phones			1
it did n't create the first flip phone ( that honor belongs to @entity96 ) , but the " slider " was all @entity4			1
the first was the company 's 8110 model , which debuted in 1998			0
how cutting edge was the design at the time ? it was the phone of choice in the futuristic 1999 sci - fi film " @entity106			2
" mobile gaming remember " @entity108 " ? it seems laughably simple compared with the range of gaming possible on today 's smartphones			2
but plenty got addicted to this game			0
even though it had already been in arcades , @entity4 began preloading " @entity108 " on its phones in 1998			2
do n't hit your own tail			0
do n't hit the walls			0
and what the heck were those things you were eating , anyway ? who knows -- but " @entity123 , " " @entity124 " and their app - store brethren owe a tip of the digital cap to @entity4 's vision of telephone - as - gaming - device			1
@entity11 warrior phones running the @entity11 operating system have n't exactly set the marketplace on fire			0
in the second quarter of this year , 7.4 million phones running @entity11 were sold , according to @entity138			0
that 's a long way behind the no. 2 system , @entity14 's @entity13 , with 31.9 million phones sold in that time			2
but @entity4 has squarely positioned itself as the leading vendor of those @entity11 phones , making 82 % of the devices sold last year			2
in 2011 , @entity11 and @entity4 announced a partnership in which @entity4 switched to the @entity11 as the default system running all of its handsets			1
that has n't been enough to put @entity4 on super-solid ground , at least not yet			0
but the longstanding partnership is what led to monday 's purchase , and if having in - house hardware gives @entity155 a boost , @entity1 and @entity4 will reap the rewards .			1

@entity1 announced it is buying @entity4 's mobile phone division
despite smartphone struggles , @entity4 has been a mobile leader
it was the first to switch to an *international* mobile - networking system
@entity4 *introduced* phone gaming and the " slider " style of handset
