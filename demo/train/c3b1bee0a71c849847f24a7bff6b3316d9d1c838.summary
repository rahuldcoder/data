-- an @entity2 man , jailed without formal charges in @entity4 for 11 months , is nearing one month on a hunger strike to call attention to his case			1
@entity8 , 53 , became ensnared in a criminal investigation linked to drug money and was arrested in june of last year on a preliminary charge of money laundering			1
but his wife and lawyer say they have proven that the source of all the money is legitimate , and wonder if other forces are keeping @entity8 , a businessman from @entity19 , locked up			1
since his arrest , at least 15 hearings have been scheduled , but only three have actually taken place			0
after hearing the defense team during one of those sessions last year , a judge ordered @entity8 released on bond			1
his family paid , but before @entity8 left the grounds of the notorious @entity31 prison in @entity32 , the judge unexpectedly rescinded his own decision			1
a new judge was assigned recently , but the case has not moved forward in months			0
the @entity4 prosecutors in the case were not available for comment			1
in mid-april , @entity8 began a hunger strike , hoping to kickstart the justice system in @entity4 as well as to rally support back home			1
supporters in @entity43 held a demonstration for @entity8 in front of the @entity46 there this month			1
the back story of his arrest is complex			0
it starts with an investment that @entity8 , an @entity52 and flooring contractor , made in 2008 in a rice operation in @entity32			1
a group of investors saw opportunity in growing rice , and though @entity8 did n't put down a lot of money , he began traveling to @entity4 to look after the project , his supporters say			1
@entity8 told @entity0 in a telephone interview from prison last year that what he found in @entity4 was that the investors had been swindled by the woman who they hired to run the project , who had ties with a @entity72 drug trafficker			1
@entity8 fired the woman and tried to set things straight , but the ownership of the land was tied to the drug trade and he found himself a suspect			1
@entity8 's detention comes at a low point in @entity2 - @entity4 relations			1
under leftist president @entity83 , the @entity2 ambassador to @entity4 was expelled in 2008 in a diplomatic row			2
his supporters are suspicious that the judge who reversed his decision on his release was subsequently promoted			0
but no corruption has been proven			0
@entity89 , @entity8 's @entity4 attorney , said that the real problem may not be a conspiracy against him , but the result of an ailing justice system under @entity94			1
" the justice system is passing through one of its worst moments , and mr. @entity8 is suffering the fallout of that , " he said			1
many @entity4 face the same kind of maddening delays , he said			2
still , @entity89 said , the court 's decision to keep @entity8 jailed is confounding			2
at the most substantive of the hearings , the defense presented more than 1,000 translated documents that showed the source of all of @entity8 's investment and proved it came from legitimate sources , @entity89 said			2
" @entity112 , we 've shown that every cent came into the country legally , " he said			0
prosecutors told @entity0 in september that they are suspicious of @entity8 because of the lengths he went through to try to recoup the investors ' losses and his continued negotiations with the landowner			1
but prosecutors have not presented any evidence to back up their claims , @entity89 said			0
" i do n't know why he remains in prison , " he said			0
under @entity4 law , a suspect can be held on preliminary charges for 18 months , at which time the state has to file formal charges or dismiss them			2
" we 're just in limbo			0
as far as i 'm concerned , @entity8 has been kidnapped , " said his wife , @entity131			2
" there 's no end to this			0
" @entity131 and @entity89 said that @entity8 's condition has deteriorated since he began his hunger strike			2
" he 's not doing well , " she said			0
@entity131 shared her story with @entity0 and others in september of last year , and said she faces legal action by the state because of her comments			0
court documents show that the state ordered a prosecutor to begin an investigation into obstruction of justice by @entity131 , her lawyers , @entity8 and others who spoke to the media			1
" it 's in the back of my mind			0
i am afraid of it , " she said of the possibility of facing charges herself			0
all this happened right before the hearing where the judge ordered @entity8 released before changing his mind			2
@entity89 said that at this point , he wants @entity8 to go to trial			0
" we want him to be absolved , " he said			0
in the meantime , despite his delicate health , @entity8 is refusing to end his hunger strike			0
" it 's the only way to be heard , " @entity89 said .			0

@entity8 has been in prison since june 2011
he has not been formally charged
family is suspicious of reasons behind his arrest
