@entity1 members on wednesday unanimously approved a resolution to address the " growing threat " posed by foreign terrorist fighters , a measure that @entity7 president @entity6 applauded while insisting it " must be matched and translated into action " to have any effect			1
" resolutions alone will not be enough , promises on paper can not keep us safe , lofty rhetoric and good intentions will not stop a single terrorist attack , " @entity6 said			2
if governments abide by the resolution and fully cooperate with one another , the world should become safer , the president said			0
but it wo n't be easy , especially given the potential of terrorism to spread beyond the @entity25 : @entity6 noted @entity7 intelligence estimates over 15,000 individuals from more than 80 nations have gone to fight in @entity29 , exacerbating the conflict there and raising the possibility they could " come home " and carry out deadly attacks			1
" if there was ever a challenge in our interconnected world that could not be met by one nation alone it is this : terrorists crossing borders and threatening to unleash unspeakable violence , " @entity6 said			2
the resolution passed wednesday requires nations to " suppress the recruiting , organizing , transporting , equipping " and financing of " foreign terrorist fighters , " according to @entity6			0
it also also calls on government to " help build the capacity of the states on the front lines of the fight			0
" but it will take more than corralling groups like @entity58 militarily to permanently address the threat , @entity6 said			0
" potential recruits must hear the words of former terrorist fighters who have seen the truth : that groups like @entity58 betray @entity68 by killing innocent men , women and children , the majority of whom are @entity74 , " the president said , using his administration 's favored term for @entity58			0
@entity6 also said the world must do better at addressing root problems -- from economic insecurity and political instability , including in @entity29 , where he called for " a political solution " to the years - long civil war there -- that play a role in drawing some to join terrorist groups			2
" we must work to address ... the oppression , the lack of opportunity , too often the hopelessness that can make some individuals susceptible to appeals of extremism and violence , " he said			0
unanimous vote , but hints of possible issues after @entity6 's roughly 10 - minute remarks , other world leaders echoed his anti-terrorism views , from @entity101 president @entity100 's blasting of groups like @entity58 and @entity103 's " despicable campaign against humanity " to @entity107 president @entity106 calling them the " scourge of mankind			1
" " terrorism is nothing new			0
it 's been with us for years , " @entity114 president @entity113 said at the @entity1 meeting			2
" but it has taken on another dimension , and it wants to conquer territory now			0
" there are no " easy answers or quick fixes " to addressing the terror threat in the @entity25 , @entity127 and beyond , @entity122 prime minister @entity121 said			1
but something must be done , he added -- and for it to work , the world 's governments must be on the same page			0
" we need a response that involves every part of government and society , and every country involved in the widest possible international coalition , " @entity121 said			1
the fact countries like @entity122 and @entity114 are backing the @entity7 is hardly surprising			1
but , as @entity6 said , what made wednesday 's vote notable is that " it is very rare where the @entity143 achieves the kind of consensus that we see represented in this resolution			1
" in fact , officials from @entity150 and @entity151 -- two ( of the five ) @entity1 permanent members who often stymy @entity7 efforts at the @entity143 , including those related to the @entity25 -- assertively staked out anti-terrorist positions on wednesday			1
in their words , though , there were hints of possible diplomatic obstacles down the road			0
@entity151 foreign minister @entity163 , for instance , warned " against any attempt to narrow down the problem " to select groups , urging the world not to have " double standards in dividing terrorists into good terrorist and bad terrorists			1
" he also said any efforts must " address longstanding conflicts " like those between @entity175 and @entity176			0
meanwhile , @entity150 foreign minister @entity177 warned about " terrorist organizations and extremist ideologies ... competing with us for future generations , " calling this " a battle bearing on the future of the world			1
" the world must act , he agreed , but only with the @entity143 ' stamp of approval			2
@entity177 did n't give examples , though the @entity7 and several @entity191 allies recently launched military strikes against @entity58 targets in @entity29 -- without the @entity143 's or @entity29 's explicit approval			1
" the @entity143 and the @entity1 have to play the leading role in the global war on terrorism , " the @entity150 minister said			1
" this is the only way to maintain unity , achieve effective coordination and take assertive action			0
" @entity6 : @entity7 leading , but ca n't do it alone before leading the @entity1 meeting , @entity6 made a more far - reaching appeal earlier wednesday for world cooperation against terror , climate change , @entity209 and a host of other issues , saying the world stands at a crossroads " between war and peace ; between disorder and integration ; between fear and hope			1
" many of the world 's problems , the president said , stem from " the failure of our international system to keep pace with an interconnected world			1
" the @entity7 is taking a leading role in addressing many of these issues			0
" i can promise you that the @entity7 will not be distracted or deterred from what must be done , " he said			1
" we are heirs to a proud legacy of freedom , and we are prepared to do what is necessary to secure that legacy for generations to come			0
" but , @entity6 said , @entity7 can not do it alone			1
the leaders of the nations gathered wednesday must decide whether they " will be able to renew the purpose of the @entity143 's founding , and whether we will come together to reject the cancer of violent extremism			1
" @entity6 outlined the @entity7 government 's plan for tackling @entity58 , which calls itself the @entity249 , including airstrikes , training and equipping forces battling the group , and working to cut off its financing and flow of recruits			1
but , as he 's said many times before , @entity7 ground troops wo n't be part of the fight			2
" already , over 40 nations have offered to join this coalition			0
today , i ask the world to join in this effort , " the president said			0
those who have joined @entity58 " should leave the battlefield while they can			0
" how @entity6 came to launch strikes in @entity29 touches on @entity209 , @entity269 , other topics while terrorism dominated wednesday 's conversation , it was n't the only topic that @entity6 addressed in his general assembly speech			2
among them : @entity269 : @entity151 's involvement in @entity269 represents " a vision of the world in which might makes right -- a world in which one nation 's borders can be redrawn by another , and civilized people are not allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones because of the truth that might be revealed , " @entity6 said , referring to efforts to recover the remains of victims of @entity291 17 , shot down over @entity269 in july			1
if @entity151 rolls back its involvement , the @entity7 " will lift our sanctions and welcome @entity151 's role in addressing common challenges , " @entity6 said			1
ebola : while the @entity7 is sending medical workers and the military to build treatment centers in @entity127 , the president called for a " broader effort to stop a disease that could kill hundreds of thousands , inflict horrific suffering , destabilize economies , and move rapidly across borders			2
" @entity308 's nuclear program : @entity6 urged @entity308 leaders to work with the @entity7 and others to resolve @entity312 concerns over the country 's nuclear program			1
" we can reach a solution that meets your energy needs while assuring the world that your program is peaceful , " he said			0
global poverty : " we will do our part -- to help people feed themselves ; power their economies ; and care for their sick , " he said			0
" if the world acts together , we can make sure that all of our children can enjoy lives of opportunity and dignity			0
" climate change : the @entity7 will work on the issue within its own borders , but " we can only succeed in combating climate change if we are joined in this effort by every major power , " @entity6 said			2
" that 's how we can protect this planet for our children and grandchildren			0
" @entity29 : even as it provides even more support -- including militarily -- to moderate opposition forces battling president @entity345 's government , @entity6 said that " the only lasting solution to @entity29 's civil war is political : an inclusive political transition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of all @entity29 citizens , regardless of ethnicity or creed			2
" @entity353 : fight against @entity58 goes on			0
