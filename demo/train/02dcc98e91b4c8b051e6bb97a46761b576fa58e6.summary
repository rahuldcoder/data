-- opponents of health care reform have reached the brink of intellectual bankruptcy			1
with no original ideas or solutions , they 've now resorted to bringing out a tried - and - tested bogeymen in a last - ditch attempt to derail much - needed legislation			0
of course , i 'm talking about trial lawyers			0
somehow , the fringes of the @entity13 have made health care about trial lawyers and medical malpractice			2
instead of focusing on how to fix our broken health care system , opponents of real reform would rather limit the legal rights of injured patients			1
medical negligence affects real people			2
the @entity26 found , 10 years ago , that up to 98,000 people die every year from preventable medical errors , and countless more are severely injured			1
this is like two 737s crashing every day for an entire year			0
if air travel were this unsafe , would we blame the passengers or the airlines ? but instead of working to create a better , safer health care system , some have decided that casting injured patients aside is an easier route to go			1
last time i checked , this bill is supposed to be about health care , not bargaining away people 's rights			1
tort law changes are not a new or novel idea			0
forty - six states have passed some kind of tort reform -- our research finds about 36 of them have some sort of cap on damages -- yet costs have continued to skyrocket			1
instead of saving money for consumers , tort reform has served as a sop to the insurance industry , allowing them to make record profits off the backs of doctors and patients			1
on average , doctors ' premiums are actually higher in states that cap the amount of damages patients or families can receive , compared with states without such caps , according to the @entity75			0
just look at @entity76 and @entity77 , frequently mentioned as " models " for tort reform despite having the most draconian anti-patient laws in the nation			1
both states impose caps on damages , a cruel and unjust way to value one 's life			0
a patient who has been disfigured , blinded , or lost a limb is worth almost nothing under their respective state laws			0
the same applies to children , the elderly , and homemakers -- because they do n't have any " lost wages , " the cost of bringing a case is almost equal to the maximum amount they can recover , putting justice out of reach			0
and how is health care in @entity76 and @entity77 today ? they both lead the nation in the number of uninsured , according to the @entity106 , and have the most expensive health care markets , it has n't lowered costs or covered the uninsured , but prevented people injured through no fault of their own from seeking justice			1
hardly a " model " the rest of the nation should follow			0
the health care bill passed by the @entity119 ) provides states with incentive payments for instituting certain malpractice pilot projects ; caps on damages or attorney 's fees do not apply , as they have clearly been miserable failures for patients in @entity77 , @entity76 , and elsewhere			2
but that wo n't stop health care reform opponents in the @entity130 from proposing similar ways to limit patients ' legal rights , even though it 's been shown time and again to not lower costs , cover the uninsured , or improve patient safety			1
lawmakers should ask families devastated by medical negligence what they think about so - called " tort reform			1
" @entity144 , 19 , had just recovered from an illness and was ready to go home when a nurse improperly removed his central line @entity148 because of the improper procedure , bubbles of air entered @entity144 's brain , heart and blood vessels			0
in front of the nurses and his own parents , who were there to take their son home , @entity144 asphyxiated and died			0
or ask the @entity163 family , whose son @entity164 has cerebral palsy from negligence that happened during his birth			0
he could not speak until he was 5 , and has been through numerous surgeries because of orthopedic issues			0
after a jury determined that @entity164 was a victim of medical negligence , caps in that state cut his verdict to a quarter of what he will need			0
@entity164 will be forced to rely on state assistance for the rest of his life			0
what 's surprising to many is that there are hardly any medical negligence suits in the first place -- less than 1 percent of the whole civil docket			2
while up to 98,000 people die every year from medical errors , and countless more are injured , only one in eight ever files suit			1
a 2006 @entity189 study found that 97 percent of claims were meritorious , debunking the idea there 's an influx of " frivolous " suits			1
it 's perplexing why this one issue -- making up only half a percent of all health care costs -- serves as red meat for such rabid health care reform opponents			2
but when one does n't have substantive , constructive solutions to fixing health care , it 's easier to create straw men and cast aspersions			0
if you want to put the trial bar out of business , start with decreasing the number of unnecessary deaths and injuries from preventable medical errors			1
not only will that lower costs and lead to healthier patients , but also mean fewer people seeking legal recourse			2
instead of limiting the rights of injured patients , institute safeguards to ensure their health and well - being in the first place			1
next time you hear a baseless attack on trial attorneys or calls for " tort reform , " remember what health care is all about : patients			1
and restricting patients ' legal rights wo n't make anyone safer or healthier , nor will it lower costs or cover the uninsured			2
it 's just another desperate distraction in a debate that has seen its fair share of off - the - wall rhetoric and political theater			0
with all the deaths each year from preventable medical errors , this is not a topic that warrants foolishness and nonsense			1
there is simply too much as stake			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			2

@entity250 : health bill foes using *scare* tactic of tort reform to stop needed change
@entity26 finds up to 98,000 people die each year from medical errors , he says
@entity250 : @entity189 study found 97 percent of claims meritorious , debunking suits are " frivolous "
he writes : instead of limiting injured patients ' rights , take steps to ensure their health
