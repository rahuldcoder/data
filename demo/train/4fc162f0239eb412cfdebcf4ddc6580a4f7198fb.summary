when is a strategy not a strategy ? when it 's a political football			2
president @entity3 has ignited fresh conservative criticism by saying " we do n't have a strategy yet " for airstrikes against @entity9 targets in @entity10			1
republicans immediately jumped on the president 's comment during a news conference thursday by saying it proved their longstanding complaint that his foreign policy failed to seriously respond to the terrorist threat from @entity20 jihadists in the @entity10 civil war			1
" i 'm not sure the severity of the problem has really sunk in to the administration just yet , " said @entity23 rep. @entity22 of @entity24 , who chairs the @entity26 intelligence committee			0
referring to the @entity9 lightning sweep across northern @entity31 this summer , @entity22 said " we knew it was a problem before june " and noted that " even the president said he was talking about this to @entity31 officials over a year ago			1
" " when a terrorist organization acts like an army , they present military targets the way any other army would do , " he said , arguing the @entity43 should have been going after such @entity9 targets earlier " to degrade and disrupt the momentum of this very dangerous organization			2
" waffling allegation retired @entity49 gen. @entity48 , the former @entity50 supreme allied commander , told @entity51 on friday that while he believed @entity3 's approach amounted to a bit of " waffling , " launching airstrikes in @entity10 requires lots of preparation			1
@entity9 is not a state but an organization fighting the @entity10 government of president @entity61 , whom the @entity43 also wants out of power , @entity48 noted			1
that creates complications , as does what he called @entity10 's " very sophisticated air defense system			0
" " i think we need to have clarity here of what that mission is , what it is before you start sending an airstrikes or troops , " he said			0
" what is the clarity here of what the end state is that we want to achieve ? we did n't do that in @entity31 or @entity82 or in @entity83			0
we 've got to do it if we 're going to get involved again			0
" the @entity26 made the same point , with spokesman @entity86 attributing any uproar over @entity3 's phrasing to spin rather than substance			1
former @entity91 chief : matter of time before @entity9 tries to attack @entity93 @entity3 strategy he told @entity51 that @entity3 " was asked a specific question about what approach he was going to pursue when it came to possible military action in @entity10 " against @entity9			1
" that was the specific question he was asked , and the president was explicit , that he is still waiting for plans that are being developed by the @entity108 for military options that he has for going into @entity10 , " @entity86 said , adding that " the president has been very clear for months about what our comprehensive strategy is for confronting " the @entity9 threat in @entity31			1
he listed steps that have become a mantra of sorts in responding to persistent questioning by reporters in recent weeks about a strategy for confronting @entity9 in @entity31 and @entity10 : a unified @entity31 government " that can unite that country to meet the threat that 's facing their country right now " ; strengthening the @entity43 relationship with @entity31 and @entity125 security forces " to make sure that they have the equipment and training that they need to take the fight to " @entity9 on the ground ; getting regional governments to join in taking on @entity9 ; forging an international coalition to join in taking on @entity9 , something @entity3 failed to do when he contemplated but eventually decided against attacking @entity10 last year over its chemical weapons ; and , the use of military force , such as the airstrikes launched in @entity31 against @entity9 to protect @entity43 personnel and minority groups under threat			1
" the president is clear that the strategy is one that 's not going to solve the problem overnight , but he 's also clear about the fact that our strategy ca n't only be the @entity43 military , " @entity86 said			1
" if we 've learned anything over the last 10 or 12 years ... it 's that a strategy that only includes military force will not be an enduring solution to this problem			0
" who is the @entity9 ? partners needed @entity158 rep. @entity157 of @entity159 concurred , telling @entity51 that @entity3 's " no strategy " comment specifically referred to airstrikes in @entity10 that awaited final planning			1
" i think the real issue there is finding a partner to work with , " he said , adding that " we need to find partners that we can work with in @entity10 to help us contain @entity9			2
" at the same time , " we certainly do n't want to come in a way that is supportive of the brutal and illegitimate @entity61 regime in @entity10 , " @entity157 said			0
" so it is a difficult problem to figure out the best strategy			0
i agree , they have safe haven there in parts of @entity10 and that will have to be part of the strategy for containing " @entity9			1
5 key questions in the fight against @entity9 past arguments republicans led by hawkish conservatives such as sen. @entity184 of @entity185 have called for years for greater @entity43 involvement in the @entity10 conflict			2
they complained when @entity3 rejected arming the @entity10 opposition against @entity61 's government as far back as three years ago			1
even the president 's former secretary of state , @entity190 , advocated more help in 2011 and 2012 for rebel factions considered moderate			2
however , opponents of such a move warned the @entity10 opposition was too splintered and ideologically diverse to arm it			0
the rise of @entity9 from former @entity200 affiliates gives fodder to the stances of both sides			0
@entity3 critics say backing moderate @entity10 factions could have prevented the extremists from gaining traction and helped the opposition topple @entity61 , as desired			1
supporters say @entity43 weapons would now be in the hands of @entity9 if they had been sent to @entity10 when the war began			2
now the @entity43 is sending weapons and other aid to some @entity10 opposition groups			0
opinion : how @entity43 can help @entity10 drive out @entity9 leading from behind the @entity10 issue touches on broader aspects of @entity3 's foreign policy and ideological differences with conservatives			1
@entity3 campaigned on ending the wars in @entity31 and @entity82 , and he forged a foreign policy based on easing the global reliance on the @entity43 to always lead the intervention charge			0
his shift came as @entity43 emerged from recession and confronted budget austerity issues that brought spending cuts across the board , including to the military			0
@entity3 and @entity158 want reduced spending spread equally as part of recalibrating government priorities			0
republicans , especially conservatives , seek to maintain and wield @entity43 military might and influence while cutting spending elsewhere to shrink the overall size of government			0
the debate underpins much of the political strategy and maneuvering in @entity159 , especially with congressional elections looming in november			0
what can the @entity43 do against @entity9 in @entity10 -- and could it work ?			2
