-- oil company @entity1 says it has resumed pumping oil to a ship on the surface after a weekend setback that halted efforts to siphon off the crude spewing from a damaged well at the bottom of the @entity9			1
crews re-inserted the tube into the well 's riser stack sunday			2
the 4 - inch pipe is now connected to a ship on the surface , 5,000 feet above the sea floor , and is pumping oil back to the surface , @entity1 spokesman @entity14 told @entity0			1
if successful , the technique will capture most of the oil that is pouring out of the well			1
the well has been spewing an estimated 210,000 gallons , or 5,000 barrels , of light sweet crude a day into the @entity9 since the sinking of the drill platform @entity29 in late april			0
" in terms of containing the flow , this was a positive step forward , " said @entity30 , a senior vice president for @entity1			1
@entity30 said that crews were operating the tool cautiously as they make adjustments to achieve an optimal flow rate up to the drill ship			0
" we 'll look over the next day or two as we continue to optimize this to see the impact we can have on reducing the amount of flow " from the ruptured pipe , he said			0
homeland security secretary @entity45 and interior secretary @entity46 issued a joint statement sunday expressing caution about the effectiveness of the insertion tube			1
" this technique is not a solution to the problem , and it is not yet clear how successful it may be , " the statement said			0
" we are closely monitoring @entity1 's test with the hope that it will contain some of the oil , but at the same time , federal scientists are continuing to provide oversight and expertise to @entity1 as they move forward with other strategies to contain the spill and stop the flow of oil			1
" the effort was dealt a setback friday night , when the frame holding the insertion tube shifted and prevented the surface vessel from connecting to it , said @entity71 , @entity1 's chief operating officer for exploration and production			1
the system was able to capture some of the leaking oil and pipe it aboard a drill ship on the surface overnight and burned off some of the natural gas released in the process , according to a statement from the joint @entity1 - @entity84 command center leading the response to the oil spill			1
@entity30 said the next step in stopping the flow will be a " top kill " procedure in which a large amount of kill mud -- a heavy fluid used in drilling operations -- is inserted into the well bore to reduce pressure and reduce flow			1
once the pressure is reduced , @entity1 hopes to be able to entomb the well in cement , effectively cutting off the gusher			2
the statement from @entity103 and @entity46 emphasized the importance of that step , saying " we will not rest until @entity1 permanently seals the wellhead , the spill is cleaned up , and the communities and natural resources of the @entity111 are restored and made whole			1
" @entity30 said the mud will be pumped through the bottom of the well 's blowout preventer at a maximum rate of 40 barrels ( 1,680 gallons ) a minute			0
" so with all of the pumping horsepower we have on the surface , we 'll be able to pump far faster than the well can flow , and it 's about us outracing the well , " he said			2
preparations for the top kill procedure will take place over the next seven to 10 days , @entity30 said			0
the slick from the spill has spread across much of the northern @entity9 , with bits of oil washing up periodically onto the shores of @entity131 's barrier islands			2
@entity71 said the application of underwater dispersants -- a tactic approved for use friday -- appears to be working			1
" the oil in the immediate vicinity of the well and the ships and rigs working in the area is diminished from previous observations , " he said after flying over the area saturday			2
the @entity84 and the @entity144 said friday that the decision to use subsea dispersants is an " important step " aimed at reducing potential damage from the spill , because dispersants can be more effective underwater than on the ocean 's surface			1
but more recent estimates suggest the actual volume of oil could be far higher than the estimated 5,000 barrels per day			0
@entity158 , executive director of the @entity160 's @entity159 , said that plumes of oil appear to have settled beneath the surface			2
" we 're clearly detecting something , " @entity158 said			0
either oil has settled on the bottom or it has risen to the surface and sunk again , as happened in the 1989 @entity169			0
" this is a very different spill than we 've ever had before , and we need to learn as much about it as we can , " he said			0
the underwater gusher began after an april 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig @entity29			0
the explosion and subsequent fire caused the @entity29 to sink two days later , prompting oil to begin spilling from the well			0
@entity1 was leasing the rig from @entity181			2
@entity0 's @entity182 and @entity183 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 : " in terms of containing the flow , this was a positive step forward "
*government* officials express caution over procedure 's effectiveness
if technique succeeds , it will capture most of the oil gushing from well
underwater dispersants appear to be working , official says
