for those of you who do not have your calendars marked and gifts or cards purchased , a reminder : sunday is @entity6 , a " holiday " that many @entity8 have the luxury and good fortune to be able to observe			1
this year , the @entity11 estimates that @entity8 will spend around $ 18.6 billion on gifts for this one day -- even though most of us go through the motions of celebrating without having any idea about the day 's original intent			2
@entity6 can be traced back to @entity16 , and its aims were quite different from anything you 'll find today on a greeting card			2
in her @entity21 of 1870 , @entity16 called on her " sisters " to work to establish peace so that her son could return home from war : " in the name of womanhood and humanity , i earnestly ask that a general congress of women without limit of nationality may be appointed and held ... to promote the alliance of the different nationalities , the amicable settlement of international questions , the great and general interests of peace			1
" this year , i would like to ask that we -- mothers and everyone else -- reignite the spirit of common purpose that @entity16 sought to inflame in @entity8 , and direct it toward a silent wartime that is taking hundreds of thousands of women 's lives each year -- childbirth			1
the @entity53 estimates that some 360,000 girls and women die worldwide each year from pregnancy or childbirth - related complications			1
nearly all of these deaths are preventable			0
it 's not that they are preventable if we find a cure , and it 's not that they are preventable if we extend expensive lifelong treatment regiments			0
they are preventable if we extend very basic , known and trusted services : if we help women get to health care facilities in their time of need ; if we ensure that a skilled professional is available to oversee their labor and delivery ; if we provide access to family planning so that children are spaced			1
these goals are all within our reach , but only if we decide that women 's lives are worth saving			0
what does the issue actually look like worldwide ? opinion : global health within our grasp if we do n't give up while rates of maternal mortality are often highest in developing countries , particularly in @entity90 and @entity91 , in several of those countries we are beginning to see declines			0
startlingly , maternal mortality rates have been rising in @entity8			0
according to the @entity53 , the rate of women who died from pregnancy - related complications in the @entity8 increased by nearly 50 % from 1980 to 2008 -- a statistic that suggests this issue is one of equitable resources and education , not a lack of technology or infrastructure			2
two years ago , i made a documentary film , " @entity108 , " and founded an advocacy and mobilization campaign called @entity111			2
i did both to raise awareness and support for maternal and child health care			1
we are trying to draw attention to an underreported global problem that can be solved if only we come together to make it a priority			0
opinion : @entity6 is not so rosy in @entity90 our organization measures success by the actions taken to reduce maternal mortality and improve maternal health			1
the goal is 5 million actions by 2015 -- perhaps signing a pledge , running a @entity130 or even a marathon or donating an old cell phone so it can be used to facilitate communication and medical care in rural areas			0
our website , everymothercounts.org , suggests specific actions to take , many of them straightforward steps that help spread the word or raise resources for simple solutions			0
individually they may seem small but together , they can save lives			0
with that said , here is what we propose for @entity6 : a " @entity149			1
" our " proclamation " encourages mothers to join in solidarity to " disappear " for the day , out of solidarity with those who needlessly die in pregnancy and childbirth			1
we believe that in acting together , we can show just how much a mother is missed when she is gone we 're spreading the word with a film to get families across the country talking about this issue , so that next year , there will be more mothers and families who can celebrate @entity6 together			1
please join me at http://www.facebook.com/everymothercounts , for @entity149			2
because together , our silence will speak the loudest for all mothers .			0

@entity111 : @entity6 first pushed bringing sons home from war
