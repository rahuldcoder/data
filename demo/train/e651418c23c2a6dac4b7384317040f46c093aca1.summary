# @entity0 has been a hashtag , a mantra , a movement and now it 's a college course			1
this spring , @entity5 will offer a new class , " 10 weeks , 10 professors : # @entity0 , " which will examine race , violence and inequality through current events and throughout history			1
the 2014 deaths of @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17 in @entity18 during confrontations with police sparked conversations on social media and protests around the world , including @entity5 's @entity25 , @entity26 , campus			1
" even though we might be sort of cloistered away in the ivory tower or something , we felt very much moved by , incited by , inspired by a lot of the activists ' work following the failure to indict @entity36 after the events in @entity15 , " said @entity27 , an assistant professor of @entity28 at @entity5			1
" we wanted to not leave this behind after winter break			0
" then , around @entity42 , @entity16 rev. @entity40 , co-chairman of the @entity41 , spoke with @entity5 faculty about " teaching @entity15			1
" by the end of @entity36 's two - hour workshop , faculty members were already brainstorming how to integrate the events and the response into coursework and campus life			2
the result was a teaching collective that draws faculty from geography , history , @entity28 , math and other areas , and the idea for an interdisciplinary course crafted and taught by all of them			1
the course is also expected to draw outside speakers and to explore ways to engage the community beyond parading professors in front of lecture halls			0
" there is a special energy around this , " said @entity69 , an assistant professor of geography at @entity5			1
" it 's designed to transgress the boundaries between disciplines in an effort to do some really deep , sustained critical thinking about some of the most important issues in the country and world at this moment			0
" the course came together quickly with support from college leaders and @entity5 's @entity87 and @entity86 , @entity69 and @entity27 said			1
enrollment opens on friday , but faculty members are still finalizing the syllabus and deciding how many students will be admitted			2
an early lesson is expected to focus on @entity93 and its racial history			2
another will consider poetry , prose , music and religious sermons			0
still others will look at how events in @entity15 were documented through different media and how black activism has evolved , " from hip - hop to hashtags			0
" as word spread about the course , there 's been an outpouring of support on campus , @entity27 and @entity69 said			0
far more than 10 faculty have signed on -- as of wednesday , 21 are " thinking together , teaching together , working together " -- and students have approached to ask whether they can sit in on the course , even if they are n't enrolled			2
in planning the course , " we 've already begun the work as a teaching collective , " @entity69 said			0
