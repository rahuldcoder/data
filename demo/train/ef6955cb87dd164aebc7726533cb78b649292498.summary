at first , the may 15 anniversary of the " @entity20 , " the exodus of more than 700,000 @entity7 after the @entity22 , looked like just another day of @entity9 - @entity7 skirmishing			1
" ( the @entity7 ) were throwing stones , and the ( @entity9 ) soldiers throw the tear gas			1
plastic bullets , " @entity3 said			0
after three or four minutes , they came back to throw stones again			0
" to protect his home , his family and his carpentry business , @entity3 installed more than half a dozen security cameras around his building , which operate 24 hours a day			0
last thursday , these cameras captured the chilling shooting deaths of two @entity7 teenagers			2
according to six hours of raw , unedited video distributed by the children 's rights advocacy organization @entity42 and reviewed by @entity2 , the two boys -- ages 17 and 16 -- were shot on the same patch of asphalt on the same day , the second victim 73 minutes after the first			2

but an @entity9 military spokesman say its forces fired no live rounds during hours of clashes on may 15			1

" the preliminary @entity62 inquiry indicates that no live fire was shot at all on thursday during the riots in @entity0 , and we have to determine what caused this result , " @entity61 added			1
security camera footage @entity2 producer @entity75 was filming the clashes in @entity0 on may 15			2
several dozen @entity7 youths used the wall of @entity3 's house as cover			1
periodically , they jumped out to hurl stones at about a half - dozen @entity9 soldiers and border police officers standing on a hilltop perhaps 100 meters away			1
the @entity9 forces responded with volleys of tear gas while periodically firing rubber - coated bullets from their rifles			1
at one point , @entity75 filmed a @entity7 teenager who appeared to be struck in the leg with one of these semi-lethal rounds			1

as he walked toward the @entity9 military positions in front of @entity3 's door , @entity102 suddenly fell forward , landing briefly on his hands , before rolling over to lie on his back			1
within seconds , a crowd of @entity7 gathered to lift @entity102 and rush him to a waiting ambulance			2
according to a medical report , @entity102 was pronounced dead in a hospital less than two hours later , having suffered a single bullet wound that entered his chest and passed out his back			0
though @entity75 did n't know it at the time , he was filming two @entity9 security troops firing their rifles at the @entity7 protesters at the same exact moment when @entity102 was shot			1
in the video , it is not clear what kind of rounds the @entity9 were shooting or whether their gunfire hit @entity102			2
however , @entity75 's camera shows that less than 15 seconds after one of these gunshots , @entity7 were already racing to put the fatally wounded @entity102 in the ambulance			1
suffering the effects of tear gas , @entity75 soon left the protest			0
he was unaware that @entity102 's wounds were fatal			0
at 2:58 p.m. , the security cameras filmed a second fatal shooting			0

@entity102 appeared to have gone to the anti-israel protests directly from school on the afternoon of may 15			2
his father showed @entity2 the bloody backpack his son was wearing when he was shot			2
there was a small hole in the bag , in roughly the same location where the bullet would have exited @entity102 's body			0
@entity196 then pulled a packet of bloodstained papers out of the bag			0
they were photocopies of a textbook that included the writings of @entity203 , accompanied by a teenage student 's handwriting , doodles and class notes			0
" we were surprised when we took the school backpack back from the hospital to find this bullet inside , " said the elder @entity102			0
