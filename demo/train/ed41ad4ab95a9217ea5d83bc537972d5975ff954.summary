@entity0 one up for the first two bulls at @entity3 's top annual bullfighting festival			1
between them , they gored or bashed three bullfighters , putting them out of action , and forcing authorities to suspend a bullfight at the @entity11 in @entity12 for the first time in 35 years , said a spokesman for @entity16 bullring , who by custom is not identified			1
in front of a sold - out crowd of 24,000 at the historic bullring on tuesday -- and a national television audience -- the first bull , weighing just over half a ton ( 532 kilograms ) gored the first bullfighter , @entity26 , in the left leg			2
he had to leave to get medical treatment			2
but the tradition says the bull must die , so in stepped the second bullfighter , @entity32 , who finished him off			2
next , it was time for the second bull , weighing slightly more than the first at 537 kilograms			0
he would prove even more dangerous			0
the third bullfighter , @entity38 , started with him , but @entity39 , who as second bullfighter on the card would normally have faced the second bull , exercised his right to step in , replacing @entity44 in the ring			0
but the second bull promptly butted @entity39 so hard in the knees that he had to be carted off to the on - site infirmary			0
that left @entity44 as the last bullfighter standing , so he again entered the ring , still facing the second bull			0
as he moved in for the kill , he was gored in the right leg , but managed to stay afoot until the bull died			0
then @entity44 joined his colleagues in the infirmary			0
there were still four more bulls to fight that day , out of the usual six on the card			1
but no more bullfighters in the shiny suit of lights			1
so authorities called it off			0
the @entity65 festival , named for @entity12 's patron saint , features 31 fights this year , from may 9 to june 8			1
it pays top dollar to the top bullfighters			1
the three injured bullfighters are recovering in a hospital			1
and the four bulls that did n't fight were returned to their ranches , safe and sound			2
