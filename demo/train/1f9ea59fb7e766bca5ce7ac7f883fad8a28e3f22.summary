-- it 's happening again			1
moments after the jury in the " loud music trial " returned with its verdict against @entity7 -- guilty on three counts of attempted murder and a mistrial on charges of murdering teenager @entity12 -- a rash of commentaries began popping up			1
writers are now expressing the kind of trepidation and angst that would have us believe that black children are not safe because a white man is lurking around every corner , waiting to shoot down a young man minding his own business			2
one of the first to weigh in was the @entity28 's @entity27 , who equated @entity12 ' murder to the selling away of slave children , a daily occurrence in the antebellum south			1
" @entity12 had a mother and a father			1
it did not save him , " @entity27 wrote			2
" @entity34 had a mother and a father			1
they could not save him			2
my son has a father and mother			2
we can not protect him from our country , which is our aegis and our assailant			2
we can not protect our children because racism in @entity48 is not merely a belief system but a heritage , and the inability of black parents to protect their children is an ancient tradition			2
" @entity55 : it 's not about ' stand your ground ' does @entity27 really believe this ? more important , does he want his son to internalize this , like one child in a photo taken outside the @entity64 , holding over his face a sign reading " i could be @entity67 " with checked boxes next to the words " loud music , " " @entity71 " and " hoodies			2
" i 'm not sure if these public voices reflect or inspire the outrage , sadness and fear resounding among black people on social media and article comments			1
what i do know is that african - americans ' fear that black boys are being hunted down at every turn by white men is just as toxic as the fear white people have of the black boogeyman			1
such histrionics create an irrational , unproductive fear for those mainly interested in driving up news ratings , tilting elections and increasing donations to special interest groups			1
indeed , @entity97 , a senior fellow at the @entity99 's @entity98 , found ( @entity100 ) that of the 53,019 homicides from 2005 through 2010 , white - on - black homicides accounted for only 3.9 % , while black - on - white homicides were 8.77 %			2
@entity105 - on - white and black - on - black homicides accounted for 44.14 % and 43.18 % , respectively			0
still , this narrative has been in high drive since the public first learned how @entity34 was killed by neighborhood watch volunteer @entity109			1
in the two years since , black parents have added " beware white gunman " to the long list warnings they issue to their black sons			0
" the talk " dates to 1863 , according to the @entity115 's @entity114 that year , the @entity116 freed slaves who then had to figure out how to navigate a world of @entity120 whites still seething over the @entity121			0
unlike the hyperbole of today , freedman warnings really were a matter of life and death			0
in " a @entity128 : an analysis of @entity135 , 1882 - 1930 , " @entity129 and @entity130 documented 2,805 victims of lynch mobs killed in 10 @entity120 states			0
" the scale of this carnage means that , on the average , a black man , woman , or child was murdered nearly once a week , every week , between 1882 and 1930 by a hate - driven white mob , " their report says			0
after @entity7 mistrial , misgivings about @entity147 law from this most deadly period , the survival conversation evolved to meet the challenges of @entity151 , the civil rights movement , the war on drugs and police profiling			1
much of modern - day talk centers on the reality that store clerks , police and people generally do view black men with suspicion , says analyst @entity163			0
but the headline of his @entity166 essay " @entity168 's killing : a parent 's @entity169 " is overwrought			0
so too was @entity172 's piece in @entity173 after @entity109 's acquittal			0
" we may never know exactly what happened the night @entity109 shot @entity34 , but black parents know this : a neighborhood - watch man saw a brown - skinned teenager -- a boy who could have been one of ours -- wearing a hoodie pulled up against the rain and assumed he was up to no good , " @entity172 wrote			1
" that suspicion set into motion a chain of events that left the boy dead			0
how do we protect against that ? " we ca n't			0
what happened to @entity12 and @entity34 were freak incidents , not unlike a plane crash , rare disease or natural disaster			1
starting the discussion with a presumption that such an event is a probability carries its own dangers			0
it presupposes white people -- men in particular -- have a pathology as great as the one put on black men : that they are violent beasts			0
we ca n't justify feeling imperiled by the idea that white men are gunning us down while rejecting sweeping generalizations regarding black men , some of whom are responsible for many of the murders in urban cities			0
these fears only work to further polarize our communities when we need to work together to alleviate the mistrust we have of one another			0
instead , we must begin to peel away centuries of the conscious and subconscious uneasiness that allows white jurors to believe that a skinny kid can make a grown man fear for his life			1
black parents have long balanced cautioning kids without having those concerns become full - blown paranoia			0
i fear we are losing this balance			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			1

@entity234 argues that **reaction** to the @entity7 verdict *inaccurately* blames race
@entity240 : **reaction** creates irrational fear for those wanting to drive up news ratings
@entity240 calls the shootings of @entity12 and @entity34 " freak incidents "
