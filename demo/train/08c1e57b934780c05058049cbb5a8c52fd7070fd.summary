-- @entity2 's state government has discovered $ 320 million in funds it did n't know it had , money that officials stumbled across while enacting statewide belt - tightening measures			1
" @entity9 came early , " gov. @entity8 said			1
during a press conference tuesday , @entity8 cited a " programming omission " and modernized tax collection processes for unearthing the $ 320 million in corporate tax revenue			1
that money had been accumulating since 2007 , but had n't been accounted for in the state 's operating budget			2
instead , this revenue went unnoticed , as the state worked to get its fiscal house in order			0
the latter effort has included several deep cuts -- including roughly $ 320 million in state funding for k - 12 education , according to state sen. @entity25			1
" we 've lost a whole year of educational opportunities for our children because of this misplaced money , " @entity25 , the ranking @entity26 member of the state senate 's appropriations committee , said in a press release earlier this week			2
in an open letter to a state budget committee , @entity25 and other @entity26 requested " an independent audit ... to determine how this significant error occurred and how @entity2 citizens can be assured that it will not happen again			1
" still , @entity8 -- a @entity39 who served as @entity41 director under president @entity42 -- has characterized the discovered money as positive , comparing it a successful move in the classic board game @entity47			0
" as far as i 'm concerned , we just drew the community chest card -- collect not $ 200 , but something much more , " said @entity8 , who has been governor since 2004			2
and @entity50 , a spokeswoman for the governor , said she does not believe the inquiry called for by @entity25 and others is necessary			0
" we know what happened			0
we know what the problem was and we 're correcting it , " she said thursday			0
@entity0 's @entity58 contributed to this report .			0
