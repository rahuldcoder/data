@entity0 , 66 , who is scheduled to be put to death this week for the murder of a 22 - year - old @entity5 sheriff 's deputy in 1998 , is hoping his sentence will be found uniquely unconstitutional			1
his defense attorneys claim @entity0 , a decorated veteran who served in @entity8 in the early ' 70s , was suffering from post-traumatic stress and bipolar disorder at the time of the shooting and was off his medication			1
in a petition filed monday with the @entity16 , @entity0 's attorneys are requesting the @entity0 's life be spared because it violates the @entity19 @entity18			1
the appeal states that " executing @entity19 combat veterans whose service - related mental impairments played a role in subsequent violent conduct violates the @entity25 to the @entity26 and analogous provisions of the @entity28			0
" the document goes on to say " death is inappropriate for those with diminished capacities to understand and process information , to communicate , to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience , to engage in logical reasoning , to control impulses , and to understand the reactions of others			0
" attorneys @entity41 and @entity42 , who represent @entity0 , say that the death penalty is reserved for the " worst of the worst " offenders who commit murder and that @entity0 does not fit that category			1
they contend his mental problems were directly related to his combat service and defense of the country 's interests and ideals			0
they are also petitioning the @entity54 that his sentence be commuted to life in prison			0
the killing of @entity60 deputy @entity58 was captured on the deputy 's dash camera just outside @entity63 , @entity5			1
versions of the video have been uploaded to @entity66			1
@entity0 is seen in the video confronting @entity68 after being pulled over for driving almost 100 miles per hour in his pickup			2
@entity0 appears to be confrontational from the start , acting irrational as the deputy tells him to keep his hands out of his pocket			1
he then mocks the deputy and at one point seems to dance around yelling " shoot me " at @entity68			0
@entity0 then yells that he is a @entity8 veteran			2
he lunges at the deputy before he runs back to his truck , grabs a rifle and begins to shoot			0
the video goes on to show a heated gun battle as both men hide behind their vehicles for cover			0
bullets appear to pierce the windshield of the deputy 's car			0
@entity0 's car door window shatters above his head			2
@entity68 and @entity0 are shot and wounded in the battle			2
but @entity0 is able to advance on the deputy , and off camera , you hear the deputy scream before @entity0 repeatedly shoots @entity68 and then flees the scene			1
@entity68 died , leaving behind a wife and child			0
@entity0 , who had no criminal record before the shooting , was convicted of the murder in 2000			2
during the trial , @entity42 says the defense did present evidence that @entity0 suffered from ptsd but claims that crucial testimony from the @entity107 doctor treating him was never heard			1
his sentence was appealed , and a judge ordered a new sentencing trial , but that was later overturned by the @entity5 @entity112			2
@entity58 's father , @entity68 , posted on his @entity115 page earlier this month that " january 12 , 2015 it will be 17 years since my son @entity116 was murdered in the line of duty and on january 13 , 2015 his killer will finally be held accountable			0
nothing will ever bring my son back , but finally some justice for the one who took him from his children and his family			0
" @entity0 is scheduled to die of lethal injection at 7 p.m. et tuesday .			1
