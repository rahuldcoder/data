-- president @entity1 recently gave a speech urging @entity3 to raise the minimum wage and announced on wednesday plans to require employers to pay overtime to more salaried employers			1
the president is certainly doing the right thing for the @entity10 public , especially women			0
a recent poll conducted by @entity13 shows that women are huge fans of raising the national minimum wage			1
seventy - six percent of women and 65 % of men surveyed support it			0
minimum wage is poised to be a driving issue this year			1
given how it polls among women , @entity22 should seize the chance to enact good policy and good politics with a group of voters they 've been alienating			1
according to a @entity0 / @entity31 , 55 % of @entity10 say the @entity22 does n't understand women			2
that number rises to 59 % among all women and 64 % among women older than 50			0
the 2012 election might have been one of the most embarrassing in recent memory for @entity22 , who insulted female voters time and again and seemed tone deaf about the challenges that women face			1
the result is that women ran from the @entity22 in droves			2
the bad news for @entity22 is that this voting trend wo n't change overnight , not as the " party of family values " continues to reject any ounce of family - friendly policy that might help women and their families grow and thrive			2
the @entity22 's policies do n't just harken back to the " @entity56 " era ; @entity57 could be their architect			0
they do n't really consider women as the powerful economic agents they are			0
in large numbers , both @entity61 and @entity62 @entity22 voted against restoring the rights of women to challenge fair pay practices when they were curtailed by the @entity67			0
republicans also blocked the @entity69 , which would provide more effective remedies to women who are not being paid equal wages for doing equal work			0
equal pay would not only help the families who depend on female breadwinners , but it would also be a boon for the overall economy by adding $ 447.6 billion to the gdp			2
failing to raise the minimum wage might be a boondoggle for the current set of @entity22 lawmakers , in that almost two - thirds of minimum wage earners are women , and women care about this issue deeply			1
there should be a lot for conservatives to like in raising the minimum wage			1
raising the wage to $ 10.10 would save $ 46 billion from the federal coffers in food assistance , an area where @entity22 have said they want to find significant savings			1
that is real savings for those who claim to care about deficits : $ 4.6 billion in the first year alone			0
republicans would be smart to leave behind minimum wage deniers like sen. @entity103 of @entity104 and rep. @entity105 of @entity106 , who have expressed the view that they do n't even think we need a minimum wage			2
these views are out of the mainstream of the @entity10 public and threaten to return the @entity10 workforce to the dark ages of employee abuse and mistreatment			0
the women who earn the minimum wage are not teenagers working the counter at @entity122 ; they are caregivers , child care workers and retail workers			1
nearly 80 % of women who earned at or below the minimum wage in 2012 were 20 years old or older , and just less than 40 % were 30 years old or older			1
oftentimes , these are women who are the breadwinners or co-breadwinners for their entire families , so adding to their wages could potentially give them additional buying power , which can help lift the economy overall			0
instead of agreeing to a media friendly set of promises to try harder to court female candidates , and finding the right female elected members to be the outward face of the party , women want @entity22 to dig a little deeper to find the real solutions that would make their lives better			2
this is n't about using the right buzzwords to not insult women , their bodies , or their place in the family			0
what would really matter is if @entity22 advocated for women where it counts : as breadwinners and drivers of our economic growth			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			0

president @entity1 recently urged @entity3 to raise the national minimum wage
@entity159 : @entity22 should support this issue , especially if it wants to *attract* female voters
she says raising minimum wage to $ 10.10 would save $ 46 billion from the federal coffers
purse : @entity22 need to see women as breadwinners and drivers of economic growth
