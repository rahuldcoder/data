one day earlier , a federal judge threw out @entity1 's original suit , blasting the seven - time @entity9 champion in a sharply worded ruling			1
in his brief order , @entity12 district judge @entity11 wrote that the case was full of legally irrelevant claims " included solely to increase media coverage of this case " and stir up hostility toward @entity3			1
he urged the cyclist to refile his lawsuit without " any improper argument , rhetoric , or irrelevant material			0

it is substantially shorter than the original lawsuit , by about 55 pages			0
@entity3 has accused @entity1 of using performance - enhancing drugs			1
@entity1 maintains he has never tested positive for performance - enhancing drugs and has said @entity3 and its ceo , @entity37 , are out to get a " big fish " to justify the agency 's existence			1
" throughout his 20 - plus year professional career , mr. @entity1 has been subjected to 500 to 600 drug tests without a single positive test , " the refiled suit reads			1
it contends @entity3 " does not have the right to force him to arbitrate those charges without a valid , enforceable legal agreement to do so			1
" the 40 - year - old @entity1 faces a lifetime ban and could be stripped of his @entity9 victories if found guilty by @entity3			1
@entity1 won the tour each year from 1999 to 2005 , most of those for a team sponsored by the @entity53			2

" @entity66 , or erythropoietin , boosts the number of red blood cells , which carry oxygen to the muscles			0
@entity1 has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years , with compatriot @entity75 -- who was found guilty of doping in the @entity76 , resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year			2
@entity1 came out fighting in may 2011 , in the face of fresh allegations made on @entity83 ' " @entity82 " show by another @entity12 , @entity85			0
in the @entity83 interview , @entity85 , who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself , says he first saw @entity1 use @entity66 in 1999			2
" i saw it in his refrigerator , " @entity85 told the news program			0
" i saw him inject it more than one time like we all did , like i did many , many times			0
" in february , @entity94 prosecutors said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against @entity1			0
they had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in @entity99 , but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that @entity1 used performance - enhancing drugs			1
