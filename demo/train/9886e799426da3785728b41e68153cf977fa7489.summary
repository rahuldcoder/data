" maj. gen. @entity18 , spokesman for the @entity0 command , identified the suspect as @entity10 , also known as @entity21 , or " the mother of the believers			1
" the arrest is considered a major stride in confronting the challenge of female suicide bombers , more than 30 of whom detonated themselves last year			1
@entity18 could n't say where she was detained for intelligence reasons			0
that 's because the authorities are after more targets			0
the bombers were recruited in @entity0 and @entity36 for the @entity38 militant group , said @entity18 , who added police were aware of the identities of the women , including their fake names on fake ids , and were on the hunt for them			0
they said they were also trying to verify @entity49 's confessions			1
@entity18 played a dvd for reporters with excerpts of the confessions of @entity49 , who is in her 40s or 50s			1
wearing a black robe and veil , she said she was asked by a man named " @entity64 " to recruit women for an @entity38 operative named @entity62 , also known as @entity63			0
she spoke about a number of the women she recruited , spending days talking to prospective operatives and persuading them to carry out attacks			0

the women , whose ages and names were not released by the military , gave themselves up after being persuaded by religious leaders and family members to " cease their training in suicide operations and reconcile , " the @entity89 military said			2
the women were connected to @entity100 in @entity1 suicide bombing cells , but it was not clear where they had been training or operating			1

troops have launched operations targeting members of families of suspected female bombers trying to break up the rings that are recruiting the women and girls			1
intelligence gathered from detainees indicates that @entity100 in @entity1 is looking for women with three main characteristics : those who are illiterate , are deeply religious or have financial struggles , most likely because they 've lost the male head of the household			2
females always have played a role in the insurgency in @entity1 , helping feed militants , hiding them in their homes and helping to sneak weapons around the country			2
they have proven to be highly effective in their operations , because of the cultural convention that women are not to be searched by men for cultural and religious reasons			0
