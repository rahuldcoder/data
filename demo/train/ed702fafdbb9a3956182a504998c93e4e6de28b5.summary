former @entity7 agent @entity6 " was not a @entity3 government employee when he went missing in @entity5 , " @entity1 spokesman @entity0 said friday			1
and @entity3 officials noted that they have no idea where he is			1
@entity0 made the comment amid reports that @entity12 , 65 , was working for the @entity13 in @entity5 , not conducting private business as officials have previously said			1
the @entity15 and @entity12 's family have denied he was working for the @entity3 government ever since he disappeared on a trip to @entity5 in 2007			1
speaking to reporters , @entity0 said there 's an investigation into the disappearance , but he would n't comment further on what @entity12 " may or may not have been doing in @entity5			1
" " i am not going to fact check every allegation made in the story you referenced , a story we believe it was highly irresponsible to publish and which we strongly urged the outlet not to publish out of concerns for mr. @entity6 's safety , " he said			2
" if there 's somebody detained overseas and it 's published , true or false , that he is working for the @entity13 , i think it is dictated by logic that that very likely puts that person in greater danger			2
what i can tell you is he was n't a @entity3 government employee when he made that trip			1
" the @entity47 and the @entity48 first reported the @entity13 angle on thursday			0
family attorney speaks @entity12 's family attorney , @entity51 , told @entity53 's @entity52 that records he found show " without a shadow of a doubt " that @entity12 was indeed a contract employee of the @entity13 on a rogue assignment in @entity5 for the agency when he disappeared			1
@entity60 and his paralegal managed to hack into @entity12 's e-mails and found correspondence with a @entity13 analyst who had known @entity12 for years			1
it was n't until @entity60 , a former federal prosecutor who worked with @entity12 years ago , found the e-mails that the family learned about the relationship with the spy agency			1
at the time of his disappearance , the @entity15 said he was on a private business trip investigating cigarette smuggling and said he was not working for the government			0
@entity12 had spied on @entity5 's nuclear program and @entity79 's cigarette smuggling in the past , @entity60 said , but on this trip he was investigating corruption and money laundering in @entity5 's oil industry			1
@entity60 said @entity12 's absence has been hard on his wife and seven children			1
" it 's been a difficult 6 ½ years for everybody that 's dealt with this , " @entity60 said			0
" and the confrontations that we 've had			0
with the agencies , with the @entity5 , they 've been very difficult			0
it 's been quite a challenge			0
and to watch the family go through that			0
" do n't know where he is @entity0 said he was not " going to say anything " that might harm " efforts to bring mr. @entity6 home , " noting that it remained a priority and the government continues to pursue " all investigative leads			2
" separately , the @entity3 does n't know where @entity12 is being held or who has him , senior @entity3 officials told @entity53			1
" we honestly do n't know where he is , " one official said			0
the officials said a 2010 video of @entity12 considered proof of life posed more questions than answers because it was sent from a cybercafé in @entity121 and had @entity123 music in the background			2
unable to pinpoint @entity12 's whereabouts , then - secretary of state @entity125 issued a statement saying the @entity3 had evidence that he was being held " somewhere in southwest @entity130			1
" this implied he may not be in @entity5 , but could have been held in @entity133 or @entity121			0
with no sign of @entity12 since , the officials said they have no way of knowing whether he is alive			2
@entity5 maintains it does n't know where he is and has offered to help find him			2
the @entity47 said it moved forward with publishing the sensitive story after holding off several times			0
" the @entity47 first confirmed @entity12 's @entity13 ties in 2010 and continued reporting to uncover more details			1
it agreed three times to delay publishing the story because the @entity3 government said it was pursuing promising leads to get him home , " the news agency said in its report			2
" the @entity47 is reporting the story now because , nearly seven years after his disappearance , those efforts have repeatedly come up empty			0
the government has not received any sign of life in nearly three years			0
top @entity3 officials , meanwhile , say his captors almost certainly already know about his @entity13 association			1
" @entity60 said @entity12 family did not want the @entity47 or @entity48 to publish the story			2
" the publication of the story was not authorized by the family , " @entity60 said			0
" we did not give permission and we were not aware other than two hours in advance that the decision had been made			0
having said that , there are some advantages to this			0
once it 's out , you no longer have to lie			0
