@entity0 , @entity1 -- a jailed @entity1 mobster claims he can prove @entity5 student @entity4 , her former boyfriend and a drifter are innocent of murdering @entity10 's @entity9 roommate because he knows who the real killer is -- his brother			1
@entity13 , 41 , made the statement during a videotaped interview with @entity10 's lawyers			1
he said he had tried to write the @entity1 court several times to say that @entity10 and the others were innocent , but no one ever contacted him , defense and prosecution officials said			2
a source close to the case tells @entity2 that @entity13 , who has been in and out of prison since age 17 , was out of prison , living down the street from @entity10 and @entity30 and under a " protection program " at the time of the murder			1
@entity13 is serving 17 years in an @entity1 prison because of his association with the @entity37 crime family			0
according to @entity1 media reports and @entity9 's @entity39 , he has testified against the mob at several trials , always from behind a screen to shield his identity			0
@entity44 , 21 , was found semi-naked with her throat slashed in the house she shared with @entity10 in november 2007			2
@entity10 and her former @entity1 boyfriend , @entity48 , 25 , were found guilty in december 2009 of @entity44 's murder and are serving sentences of 26 and 25 years , respectively			1
a third person , @entity30 , a drifter originally from the @entity53 , plead guilty to the murder and is serving a 16 - year prison sentence			0
in march , @entity13 contacted @entity10 's attorneys , who visited him in prison to learn more about his story			1
@entity13 told @entity10 's lawyers during the videotaped interviews that his brother , who was staying with him at the time of @entity44 's murder , came home one night and said he had killed a girl during a botched robbery			1
@entity9 and @entity1 media have reported the brother 's whereabouts are unknown and neither the lawyers for @entity10 nor the prosecution would comment further			1
" when he came to my house he had a bloodstained jacket on and was carrying a flick knife			0
he said he had broken into a house and killed a girl and then he had run away , " @entity13 said in his statement			2
originally from @entity78 , @entity13 says he was living in @entity79 at the time of the attack			0
" i know [ he was involved ] because my brother confessed to me that he had killed @entity30 and he asked me to hide a blood - stained knife and set of keys , " he said , according to an attachment to @entity10 's appeal documents			1
@entity13 told the lawyers that his brother said he and an @entity91 man broke into the house and found " the poor @entity94 girl , " @entity44 , " who started screaming like mad " the brother " stabbed her in the throat then he tried to stifle her screams , " @entity13 said			1
" @entity30 defended herself like mad , scratching and hitting out at him			0
" @entity13 said he can prove @entity10 's innocence and his brother 's involvement because of evidence he buried at his home			1
" i had everything under a little wall behind my house , " he said			0
" i am happy to stand up in court and confirm all this and wrote to the court several times to tell them but was never questioned			0
" @entity1 prosecutor @entity114 , who led the case against @entity10 and @entity48 , told @entity9 and @entity1 media that @entity13 's claims were irrelevant since the court already deemed him not credible and did n't interview him			1
see the evidence presented in the @entity10 case @entity114 told @entity2 on thursday he could n't comment much on @entity13 's assertions because " we need to verify his claims , in general , all of what he is saying			1
" @entity114 said he has not yet interviewed @entity125 , but will begin looking into his background as part of an investigation			0
that investigation will include checking out the burial of the key			0
@entity10 's lawyer , @entity131 , said he hopes a judge will allow @entity13 to testify at @entity10 's appeal hearing , which is likely to take place in the fall			2
" the court should have vetted the reliability of the person and the worthiness of his claims , " @entity131 said			0
" we have posed again the same request to the appeals court			0
in filing an appeal , @entity131 pointed to @entity13 's letters to the courts , saying they show @entity10 was not able to present all the witnesses , and that may have influenced the verdict			1
we " ca n't simply investigate in the course of a trial every claim that comes up , " @entity114 told @entity2			0
@entity155 , a lawyer for the @entity10 family , said that while they do n't yet know whether @entity13 's claim is valid , he feels it is only right that @entity10 get to air all the evidence in court			1
even if the story is n't true , @entity10 and her lawyers should at least get the chance to investigate it and have his claims heard , @entity162 said			2
" the fact that the court did n't even decide to question him or at least look further into the claims is a part of what @entity4 's appeal is all about , " he said			2
" we do n't know the truth , but the court has the responsibility to check it out			0
" @entity162 also said he thinks it 's possible @entity13 's statements were n't checked out because @entity1 police and prosecutors believed they already solved the case			2
" there 's no motivation i would guess for the police to actually pursue it , " he said , when asked if the keys , clothing or knife @entity13 claims were buried were ever dug up			2
" in their minds not only is it over , but why would they investigate something that might show their initial investigation was faulty			0
