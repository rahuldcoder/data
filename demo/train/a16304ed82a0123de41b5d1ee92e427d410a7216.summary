as the ramifications of a grisly chemical weapons attack loom over a summit of world leaders , some of @entity2 's staunchest friends blasted what they call the " arrogance " of @entity10 - led efforts to strike the war - torn nation and said those who do will pay a steep price			1
@entity15 's ayatollah @entity14 said thursday the @entity10 -- which , in addition to being one of his country 's chief adversaries , has led the push to punish @entity2 president @entity22 's government over chemical weapons -- has no right to make " humanitarian claims ( given ) their track record " in @entity27 , @entity28 and at the military prison in @entity30 , @entity31			1
the turmoil in the @entity34 , @entity15 's leader said in remarks reported by state - run @entity36 , is a " reaction of the global arrogance " that is rooted @entity39			2
should the @entity10 and allies strike @entity2 , he added , it wo n't be able to " eliminate ( the ) resistance			2
" " we believe that the @entity10 are committing a folly and mistake in @entity2 and will , accordingly , take the blow and definitely suffer , " said @entity14			2
he spoke on the same day @entity47 issued its first official statement since the effort began to strike @entity22 's forces in the wake of an august 21 chemical weapons attack outside @entity53 that , the @entity10 estimates , killed more than 1,400 people , many of them children			1
video : rows of bodies , injured children after attack the group , which is popular in parts of the @entity63 world yet labeled a terrorist organization by the @entity10 , claimed that any military action against @entity2 's government is " a form of direct and organized terrorism			1
" " these threats fail to conceal the true objectives of this strike aimed at mobilizing @entity76 ( strength ) in the region in an attempt to impose the @entity81 colonial grip , " @entity47 alleged in a statement read by parliamentarian @entity70 , as reported by @entity72 's official @entity71			2
the remarks from @entity47 and @entity15 are significant , given concerns that international military intervention in @entity2 could set off a wider war that further destabilizes the region and , thus , the world			2
based in @entity72 , @entity47 is linked to numerous terrorist attacks and is one of @entity76 's chief adversaries			2
so , too , is @entity15 , which has been at odds with @entity39 and others for years regarding its nuclear program			0
still , @entity10 and other leaders continue to press for military action against @entity2 's government -- taking their arguments , through friday , to the @entity96 summit in @entity97 , @entity98			1
before heading east , @entity10 president @entity99 said that he believes the world has a duty to act , saying a failure to do so would give those with chemical , biological and nuclear weapons @entity104 to use them on anyone			1
arguing that " the international community 's credibility is on the line , " the president said , " the moral thing to do is to not to stand by and do nothing			2
" yet @entity98 , which repeatedly has used its veto power to block @entity117 efforts targeting @entity22 , has pushed back			0
they accused @entity39 and others of being overzealous and bull - headed by ordering strikes without irrefutable proof @entity2 leaders are responsible for using chemical weapons , something they do n't publicly believe			2
@entity98 president @entity125 even went so far as to accuse @entity10 secretary of state @entity126 of being dishonest as he makes the case to @entity128 for a strike , including his assertions about the role of an @entity133 - linked group in @entity2			1
" he is lying , and ( he ) knows he is lying , " @entity125 said at an event wednesday			0
" @entity137 scientists find traces of sarin gas @entity98 also has challenged assertions that @entity2 forces has used chemical weapons , killing rebel fighters and civilians , including in the attack last month on a rebel stronghold near @entity53			1
such accusations against @entity22 and his government are hardly new since his government cracked down on protesters in 2011 , setting off what became a civil war that the @entity117 estimates has left more than 100,000 people dead , produced over 2 million refugees and displaced another 4 million inside @entity2			2
the violence shows few signs of abating : on thursday , for instance , the opposition @entity159 reported at least 87 more dead nationwide , among them 14 women and 14 children			1
how you can help @entity2 refugees while the overall bloodshed has drawn rebukes and spurred some support for the opposition , it 's chemical weapons allegations -- involving sarin gas , an extremely volatile and potentially lethal nerve agent -- that provoked the threat of direct international military action			1
in june , @entity176 's foreign minister said samples in his nation 's possession showed sarin gas had been used several times in @entity2			0
the @entity10 has made such assertions on multiple occasions , including in april when defense secretary @entity183 alleged there 's evidence sarin had been used lethally on a small scale			1
more recently , secretary of state @entity126 said sunday that blood and hair samples from near the august 21 eastern @entity53 attack site " tested positive for signatures of sarin " gas			1
what are signatures of sarin gas ? and on thursday , the @entity137 prime minister 's office announced that its military scientists found traces of sarin gas in soil and clothing taken from a patient treated near the site of an alleged chemical weapons attack outside @entity2 's capital			1
scientists at the @entity210 military laboratory concluded the samples were unlikely to have been faked , and @entity137 is sharing its findings with the @entity214 , the office said			1
the @entity117 was expected to review samples taken by its own inspectors this week			0
echoing rebel forces , @entity39 has insisted that @entity22 's forces are behind such chemical weapon attacks , claiming only they have access to them and can deploy them on a large scale			0
yet @entity2 has been equally adamant it has done no such thing , instead accusing " terrorists " -- its blanket term for opposition fighters -- of deploying chemical weapons			0
who is to blame , and what the world should do about it , looms large over thursday and friday 's @entity96 gathering of world leaders in @entity97 , @entity98			0
@entity96 : where geopolitics trump economics the summit 's focus is officially on economic matters , though the deep divisions among its participants on this pressing issue are hard to ignore : the @entity10 and @entity176 leaders are calling for a military strike against @entity2 's government , while @entity98 leaders are standing by their longtime ally and questioning claims @entity22 's government is responsible for gassing its own people			1
how these talks influence the debate , if at all , is itself in question			0
when asked thursday while walking alone to dinner if any progress had been made on @entity2 , @entity10 president @entity99 said , " no , we talked about the economy			1
" fervent debate in @entity10 , around the world a sweeping international consensus seems unlikely as long as @entity98 -- which will host @entity2 foreign minister @entity263 in @entity264 on monday , according to @entity2 's official @entity266 news agency -- and the @entity10 maintain their firm positions @entity126 said this week , in @entity39 , that " at least 10 countries have pledged to participate " in a military intervention that @entity99 and @entity176 president @entity271 have urged			1
yet that figure could well change			0
@entity137 , normally a dependable @entity10 ally in military affairs , has voted against joining any military action			1
and officials in @entity176 -- where polls show one in three people favor strikes -- have said they will wait until the @entity10 decides on a course of action			1
read the @entity283 draft resolution (			0
pdf ) that wo n't come until after @entity128 weighs in , likely next week , on a measure authorizing strikes focused on degrading @entity2 's ability to use chemical weapons			0
while congressional leaders have backed @entity99 's call for action , most legislators are officially undecided so much that what happens is still anyone 's guess			2
" it weighs on me , " said sen. @entity297 , @entity298 , who added " it is conclusive " chemical weapons were used			0
" ... there is no question that what ( public reaction ) is coming in is overwhelmingly negative			0
" yet the president -- arguing that the world can not afford a country to use such weapons against its own people without responding -- has n't promised he 'll abide by the vote in @entity128			0
and @entity312 spokesman @entity311 said the @entity2 government " should not take solace from the deliberative process that we are undertaking right now			0
" " we have time to adjust , if necessary , given conditions on the ground , given what the @entity2 regime may or may not do in terms of movements of equipment and so forth , " @entity311 told reporters thursday			0
fast facts : @entity327 gas whatever the @entity10 decides , some world leaders are stumping against military action			1
in a letter thursday to @entity125 in his role as host of the @entity96 summit , @entity330 urged a " peaceful solution through dialogue " and called an armed intervention a " futile pursuit			0
" speaking from @entity97 , @entity340 president @entity339 said that while the international community " can not remain idle " in the face of @entity2 's apparent chemical weapons use , " there is no military solution to the @entity2 conflict			0
" " only a political solution can end the terrible bloodshed , grave violations of human rights and the far - reaching destruction of @entity2 , " he said			0
" too many lives have already been lost and too many people have suffered for too long and lost too much			0

@entity47 calls potential @entity10 strikes a form of " organized terrorism "
@entity99 continues to press for a military action as a " moral " imperative
