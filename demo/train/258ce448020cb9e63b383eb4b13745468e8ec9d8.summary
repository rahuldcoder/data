-- @entity1 often says that moms have the hardest job in the world , but plenty of fathers carry the burden of raising a child all by themselves			1
in fact , 2.5 million single fathers in the @entity11 are doing it all -- juggling schedules , putting food on the table and going to school plays or soccer games -- single - handedly			2
@entity19 and his expanded family visited @entity1 on her show			1
@entity19 and his wife , @entity22 , had their first son , @entity23 , 19 years ago			1
when @entity22 died of cancer only two - and - a - half years later , @entity19 says he was overwhelmed with grief			1
" the year after she died , i was just so immersed in the tragedy of her death , " he says			1
" then i thought : ' i ca n't live like this anymore			1
i ca n't have this be our life			1
' " he decided it was time for @entity23 to have a sibling			1
at the time , it was almost impossible for a single male to adopt in the @entity40 , so @entity19 applied for both international adoption and surrogacy			1
surprisingly , both applications went through , and soon @entity19 became a father of three			1
still , he says he was ready for more			2
today , @entity19 is raising nine children on his own ! " i never thought i 'd be a father of nine			1
actually , i never imagined i 'd be a father , " he says			2
" maybe this all happened for a purpose			0
because if @entity22 had n't died , i never would have done what i did and these kids would n't have had a home			1
" @entity0 : 8 things never to say to an adopted child when it comes to raising nine kids ( @entity23 , 19 ; @entity57 , 16 ; @entity58 , 15 ; @entity59 , 13 ; @entity60 , 12 ; @entity61 , 10 ; @entity62 , 8 ; @entity63 , 5 ; and @entity64 , 3 ) , @entity19 says there is never a dull moment			1
his schedule is jam - packed , and it starts at 3 a.m. as if being a single dad is n't enough work , @entity19 also works full time as a corporate attorney			1
" when the second bus picks up the younger kids at quarter of nine , i leave and drop @entity64 off at daycare			1
then i go to work all day and come back and pick her up when daycare closes at 6 o'clock and then head home , " he says			0
" [ i work at ] a very warm and family - oriented firm , so they 're very supportive			1
" though @entity19 's big family is thriving , he says there were a few small bumps along the way			1
@entity59 's arm broke when he was an infant and had n't healed properly before he joined the @entity19 family , but @entity19 says extensive orthopedic surgery fixed the problem			1
@entity60 had failure to thrive syndrome , which caused her to have trouble connecting with others -- though @entity19 says she opened up after three months in his busy house and is doing great			1
and , @entity63 's speech was delayed , he says			0
" she had therapy for about six months , and now sometimes i wish i had n't given her speech therapy , " he jokes			1
is there room for any more kids in the @entity19 family ? depends on whom you ask ! " i thought five was it , and i thought six was it , " @entity19 says			1
" my sense is that nine is probably it ... because international adoption 's a lot more difficult , and i 'm older			0
... [ but ] i 've been given a lot of opportunities , and if it happened again , i 'd have a hard time saying no. " @entity23 , who is a sophomore at @entity112 , says the family is at capacity			1
" we 're at a pretty full limit right now , " he says			0
" now that i 'm in school , i 'd like to be around if there 's going to be another sibling			2
" though he 's rooting for @entity64 to be his youngest sibling , @entity23 says he 's incredibly proud of his dad			1
" just how selfless he is , " he says			0
" i do n't know of anybody else who puts people before themselves like he does			2
" though @entity19 did n't plan on being the single dad of such a huge family , he says it came naturally to him			1
" i 'm more comfortable doing something for somebody else than myself , " he says			0
" particularly with adopting the kids overseas , when i went to @entity131 for the first time to adopt @entity57 and saw all the kids who did n't have a home and or a place to go at night , i just thought , ' this is n't right			1
' " it may have been an unexpected path for @entity19 , but he says its one he 's grateful for			1
" i love parenting , " he says			0
" i just felt , ' this is what i want to do			0
' " @entity0 : talks every parent should have @entity143 's blog on march 25 , 2008 , @entity144 woke up to what should have been a perfect day			2
he and his wife , @entity146 , were proud new parents -- their daughter @entity148 had been born the day before			2
but that afternoon , @entity146 died of a blood clot that no one knew she had			2
with a newborn in his care , @entity143 had no time for mourning			0
" right after @entity146 died , i had to go straight in and i had to feed her ( @entity148 )			2
i mean , she had to eat			0
i had to change her diapers			0
life did n't stop when @entity146 died , " he says			1
" i did n't know what i was going to do			2
i literally did n't know if i was going to live through this			2
" @entity143 and @entity158 survived the tragedy , and @entity143 used the blog he 'd created to document @entity146 's pregnancy as an outlet for his grief			2
" if i write it , i can get it off my chest , " he says			0
after @entity146 's death , tens of thousand of people started reading @entity143 's blog			1
the outpouring of support -- including notes , money and toys -- from the online community shocked him			0
" to have total strangers giving us stuff and wanting to make sure we 're okay all the time was just incredible , " he says			0
@entity143 says he 's determined to give back as much as he 's been given			0
" we 've donated all of the clothes that no longer fit and the toys that we could n't use , " he says			2
" we 've been given a lot of money as well , and we 've tried to give that away as much as we can			0
" @entity143 has also established the @entity186 , which helps widows and widowers with children			1
a year after @entity158 was born , @entity143 's still adjusting to life as a single parent			0
he 's even joined the neighborhood new moms group			0
" they sort of adopted me , " he says			0
" they took me in and made sure i was n't screwing things up too terribly			2
" @entity143 says one of the scariest things about @entity146 's death is that she took all her parenting knowledge with her			0
" @entity146 had read all the books			0
she had done everything that we needed to do to make sure that this baby was taken care of properly , " he says			0
" it 's not something i ever anticipated doing on my own			0
" @entity143 says he 'd planned to be the free - spirited parent , while @entity146 would be the rigid one			0
given the circumstance , @entity143 has struck a balance			0
" i 've had to be a little more strict in the way that i do things , but i still let her eat sticks and leaves from time to time			0
