@entity0 , @entity1 -- the number of crew members charged is rising , and so is the anger that families feel			1
but there 's one crew member they are leaving out : @entity10 , 22 , who by witness accounts helped passengers escape and distributed life jackets -- one after the other to students -- as the stricken ferry began to sink			1
when she ran out of jackets , she ran to the next floor to grab more			1
when she was asked why she was n't wearing a life jacket , @entity10 said that crew members would be last and that she had to help others first , according to witness accounts to @entity1 media			1
@entity26 's body now lies in a funeral home in the city of @entity0			2
she is one of the more than 100 people dead ; 215 remain missing			1
the other day , a man with injuries to his head showed up to the funeral room where @entity26 's memorial stands			2
when asked by @entity10 's family who he was , the man said that he had been injured in the ferry and that he was " indebted " to the young woman who placed a towel on his bloody head and helped him as the water rose			1
" she was so responsible and so kind , " said her grandmother , @entity44 , 75 , who sat on the floor , slumped against a wall , no longer able to stand			2
her family members kneeled with her , holding her hand and weeping together on the floor			1
white mums and lilies , which signify death , poured in from strangers , covering the hallway leading to her memorial room			2
the flowers contain messages like " we will not forget your noble spirit			2
" " we will always remember your sacrifice			2
" an online petition has gone up urging the government to award her a @entity68 award			0
her relatives say @entity10 wanted to stay in college , but she felt responsible for supporting her family after her father passed away two years ago			0
so she dropped out and joined the ferry company in 2012			0
she was transferred to a bigger ship , the @entity76 , about six months ago , because she had proved her capabilities , her relatives said			1
the @entity76 's sinking has left many appalled by the alleged actions of several members of the crew -- including the captain , who now faces a series of criminal charges for his role in last week 's sinking			1
" this is so unfair that our @entity93 had to die while the captain ran away , " said her aunt , who declined to give her name			0
" @entity93 was so responsible , and the captain just ran away			0
" over two - thirds of those on board were students on a high school field trip , many of whom remain missing			1
students grieve in hometown the students attended @entity105 in @entity106 , a leafy suburb of @entity107			1
the high school is missing most of its sophomores , and classes are to resume thursday			1
those who are not students , teachers or parents were not allowed on school grounds to allow those to grieve privately			1
well - wishers milled outside the school gate , writing post-it notes and signs with messages of hope and encouragement			0
" brothers and sisters , please come back , " one read			0
@entity125 , a local college student who knew about 10 of the missing students through her church , stood outside , silently praying			1
" i just hope , maybe , they could be found alive , " @entity125 said , wiping her tears			0
" i 'm hoping @entity130 will intervene			0
" " it feels so empty now , " said student @entity131 , 17			0
" it 's not an environment where you can study now			0
" every student there knows someone who has died or gone missing , the teenagers said			2
" i want everything to be a lie , " high school student @entity139 said			0
