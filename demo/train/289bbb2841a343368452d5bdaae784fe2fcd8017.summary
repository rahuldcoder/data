@entity2 -- " please excuse me , i ca n't talk about this			0
" @entity4 ! the phone line goes dead			2
we had tried to get this @entity8 businessman to talk about the mysterious death of @entity10			1
@entity10 has emerged from the shadows to be a key link in a story of intrigue , mystery and betrayal that goes all the way to the inner sanctum of @entity20 's secretive @entity19			1
@entity10 was found dead last november in his hotel room in the sprawling southwestern @entity20 city of @entity23			1
according to media reports , local authorities quickly ruled his cause of death as " excessive alcohol use			2
" an autopsy was not performed , media reports said , and his body was cremated			0
slowly , however , media reports are raising more uncomfortable questions about @entity10 's death			1
he was married to a @entity20 woman and had business interests in the country			1
he moved in the orbit of a company known as @entity40 , a @entity8 strategic information consultancy formed by former officers of the @entity8 's spy agency @entity43			1
@entity44 has released a statement on @entity10 , saying , " we had a long history of advising @entity49 companies on @entity20 and we are among those who sought ( @entity10 's ) advice			1
we are greatly saddened by his death			2
" now , the @entity8 government is asking @entity20 to investigate @entity10 's death			1
" our embassy in @entity2 and consulate general in @entity23 provided consular assistance to the family , as we would in any case involving a @entity8 national overseas , " the @entity59 said			1
" we recently asked the @entity20 authorities to investigate the case further after we heard suggestions that there were suspicious circumstances			1
" @entity10 's family has denied comment			1
@entity3 has spoken to a man who says he knew @entity10 , but who would not speak publicly because he was worried about his safety			2
he confirmed the dead man had business in @entity20 and said that for someone who supposedly died from an alcohol binge , in his experience @entity10 was not a heavy drinker			1
@entity10 's death on its own -- a man linked to former spies , a light drinker dead from apparent alcohol poisoning -- would be suspicious enough			1
but this case has more -- much more			0
@entity10 has been linked to the scandal and sacking of a man once seemingly destined for the heights of power in @entity20			1
the rise and fall of @entity20 's @entity88 @entity88 is what is known as a " princeling , " the son of a @entity93 - era revolutionary hero			1
@entity88 rose through @entity20 's political ranks and was appointed @entity19 secretary of @entity23 , a city of more than 30 million people			1
he quickly became known as an anti-crime crusader			0
@entity88 smashed criminal gangs and locked up corrupt businessmen			0
he won praise from locals , especially the poor			0
migrant workers flocked to @entity23 seeking , and often finding , a better life			0
but @entity88 also made enemies			0
he relied heavily on @entity93 slogans and revived cultural revolutionary songs			0
in a country embracing capitalism , @entity88 cultivated an image as " redder than red			0
" just last month , however , @entity88 's career started to unravel			0
his right - hand man and former top cop @entity113 spectacularly sought refuge in an @entity117 consulate			0
@entity20 axes @entity88 from @entity23 after scandal @entity113 wanted asylum , apparently fearing for his life and allegedly holding incriminating information on his old boss			2
this is where @entity10 re-enters the picture			2
the @entity128 , quoting anonymous diplomatic sources close to the case , reports @entity113 clashed with @entity88 after raising his suspicions that @entity10 had been poisoned			2
after leaving the @entity117 consulate , @entity113 was taken away by state police and has not seen or heard from since			0
less than two weeks ago , @entity88 was fired from his position , his career and ambitions to enter the politburo standing committee -- the nine men who run @entity20 -- shattered			2
@entity88 has not been seen in public since			0
in a year of political transition in @entity20 , with a new generation of leaders poised to inherit power , the @entity88 case has captivated the country			2
in the rowdy back streets of @entity23 locals gamble , drink and discuss @entity88 's downfall			0
on a recent visit by @entity3 , they praised their former party boss			0
some of them openly mocked vice president @entity152 , the man likely to be @entity20 's next supreme leader			1
" this is a battle of the gods , not ordinary people , " said one old man , who has seen leaders and revolution come and go			0
but the gods who made the law in @entity23 are now themselves under investigation			0
@entity88 , the man who ran the criminals out of town , now finds himself ousted			0
and @entity10 , found dead in a @entity23 hotel room , may still yet have a tale to tell .			1
