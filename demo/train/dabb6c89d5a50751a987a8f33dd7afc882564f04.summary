editor 's note : @entity2 is president of @entity4 - based @entity3 and the author of " dear mr. @entity6 : what an investor learns 1,269 miles from @entity10 " , a book about the causes of the global financial meltdown			1
her company is a consulting firm for institutions and institutional investors on derivatives , the securitization of assets , and mergers and acquisitions			0
her firm has done work for investment banks but not for @entity26 ; she worked for the company in the 1980s			2
@entity2 says @entity26 ' record profits were enabled by the taxpayer - funded bailout			1
@entity4 , @entity30 ( @entity31 ) -- @entity26 announced record earnings tuesday of $ 3.44 billion for the second quarter of 2009			1
@entity26 's stock price leapt 77 percent for the first half of 2009 , and closed tuesday at $ 149.66 a share			1
without an ongoing series of front - and backdoor bailouts financed by @entity42 taxpayers , most of @entity26 's record profits would not have been possible			1
in april 2009 , @entity26 ' ceo , @entity43 , who received record salary and bonus compensation of $ 68.5 million in 2007 , said that bonus decisions made before the credit crisis looked " self - serving and greedy in hindsight			1
" now , they look self - serving and greedy with foresight			0
@entity26 set aside $ 11.4 billion for employee compensation and benefits , up 33 percent from last year			2
that 's enough to pay each employee more than $ 390,000 , just for the first six months of this year			0
in june , @entity26 bought back its preferred shares , repaying $ 10 billion it received from the government 's @entity56 , or @entity56 , and setting it free of limits on executive compensation and dividends			2
but pay is not the key issue			0
@entity42 taxpayers deserve a large cut of the profits , not the chump change -- less than a half - billion dollars -- they got from preferred shares in the company and the relatively small amount they could get from warrants in its stock			1
@entity42 taxpayers should insist that a large part of @entity26 's revenues and profits belong to the @entity42 public			1
@entity56 money was just part of a series of bailouts and concessions that allowed @entity26 to prosper at the expense of a flawed regulatory system			2
in march 2008 , @entity26 , a primary dealer in treasury securities , was among the beneficiaries of a massive backdoor bailout by the @entity88			1
at the time , @entity89 , former ceo of @entity26 , was treasury secretary			2
in an unprecedented move , the @entity90 created a @entity92 , or @entity92 , that allowed primary dealers like @entity26 to give non-government - guaranteed " triple - a " rated assets to the @entity90 in exchange for loans			1
the trouble was that everyone knew the triple - a assets were not the safe securities they were advertised to be			0
many were backed by mortgage loans that were failing at super speed			0
the bailout of @entity107 , or @entity107 , ballooned from $ 85 billion in september 2008 to $ 182.5 billion			0
of that money , $ 90 billion was funneled as collateral payments to banks that traded with @entity107			0
@entity42 taxpayers may never see a dime of their bailout money again , but @entity26 saw plenty			1
@entity26 may be the largest indirect beneficiary of @entity107 's bailout , receiving $ 12.9 billion in collateral , including securities lending transactions , from @entity107 after the government bailed out the insurance company			2
the key question is whether @entity26 asked @entity107 to insure products that were as dodgy as the doomed deal from @entity125 exposed by @entity127 's @entity126 in his october 16 , 2007 , @entity121 - winning article : " junk mortgages under the microscope			2
" if the federal government had not intervened and if @entity107 had gone into bankruptcy , @entity26 probably would not have received its $ 12.9 billion from @entity107			2
@entity42 taxpayers and the @entity42 economy are owed some of the bailout money passed directly through @entity107 to @entity26			1
@entity10 firms also reaped trading windfalls when @entity107 needed to close out its derivative transactions			2
this was the most lucrative windfall business in the history of the derivatives markets			0
when @entity107 left money on the table , it was @entity42 taxpayer money			0
@entity26 was granted bank holding company status in the fall of 2008			0
it already had the temporary ability to borrow from the @entity90 through the @entity92 , which would have expired in january 2009			0
now it has permanent access to lending from the @entity90 @entity26 can now compete with the largest @entity42 banks and borrow money at interest rates pushed as close to zero as possible by the @entity26 gets a further benefit : favorable accounting rule changes			1
in addition , @entity26 issued $ 30 billion of debt with a valuable government guarantee that remains outstanding			0
meanwhile , the @entity42 public faces a rising unemployment rate , falling housing prices , rising unemployment , higher local taxes and a dismal economic outlook			0
interested men with reputations and fortunes at stake rode roughshod over public interest			0
the @entity42 public is owed part of the profits @entity26 was able to make because of the largesse of our @entity175			1
@entity10 's " financial meth labs , " including @entity26 's , massively pumped out bad bonds and credit derivatives that have melted down savings accounts , pension funds , the municipal bond market and the @entity42 economy			1
risky assets , leverage and fraud led to acute distress in the global financial markets			0
the biggest crime on the @entity42 economy may go unpunished with no consequences to the perpetrators			1
the biggest crime was not predatory lending , but predatory securitizations , packages of loans that did not deserve the ratings or prices at the time they were sold			0
they ballooned what should have been a relatively small problem into a global crisis			0
@entity10 owes the @entity42 public for its key role in bringing the global economy -- and in particular , the @entity42 economy -- to its knees			1
@entity26 is not alone in owing the @entity42 public			1
it is not the worst of all of the @entity10 firms			0
but among all of @entity10 's offenders , it is the most well - connected , and @entity26 was the firm that cleaned up the most as the result of government bailouts			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity26 reported record second - quarter profits
she says @entity26 and @entity10 helped bring down the @entity42 economy
@entity26 reaped huge profit enabled by help it got in federal bailout , she says
@entity2 : taxpayers deserve a large share of what @entity26 made
