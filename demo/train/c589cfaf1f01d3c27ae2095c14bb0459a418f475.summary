-- like many parents across the city of @entity4 , the @entity1 waited			1
twenty - five years ago , it was all they could do			0
there were no mobile phones to call , no text messages that could be sent to calm the frayed nerves of concerned families			0
@entity12 was n't on - hand to provide minute - to - minute updates ; @entity15 statuses could n't be refreshed to comfort worried relatives			0
so they waited , hoping to see their son @entity18 appear at the bottom of the road			0
" i was there , so i remember everything about the day , " recalls the man who was that teenage boy			0
now 42 , @entity25 went on to play more than 250 games for @entity4 between 1990 and 1999			1
but back then , he was still making his way as a professional player			2
" i traveled along with the @entity4 youth team , the apprentices and the reserves , to watch the game , " he tells @entity0			1
" i was always ok because i was with the team and the players ' wives , so we were in the main stand			0
fortunately i was in the stand watching the incident unfold in front of me			0
it was a harrowing experience			0
" it should n't happen when you get up in the morning and go to watch a football match			2
" it was april 15 , 1989			1
@entity4 's senior team was contesting an @entity47 semifinal against @entity48 75 miles away at the @entity49 in @entity50			1
while @entity25 was able to return home to his family , others never would			1
the death of 96 fans on that spring afternoon cast a shadow which still hangs over a sport , a football club and a city			1
the match kicked off at 15:00 local time but within minutes it had been abandoned , the football becoming irrelevant when framed against the human tragedy unfolding in the @entity65 stand			1
in those days huge banked terraces were commonplace in @entity68 football			1
metal fences separated the thousands gathered in the stands from the pitch			2
the fatal crush in such a terrace at @entity49 sent a jolt through @entity68 's @entity76 , eventually leading to the introduction of all - seater stadia			1
" that was the end of standing in stadiums , " @entity25 says			1
" the stadiums are safe now , they 're all modernized and better			0
" it is a tragedy that is not just felt in the red - jersey - wearing half of @entity4			1
on that same day , @entity87 's other football club @entity86 also contested an @entity47 semifinal against @entity89			1
the blue half of @entity4 celebrated a 1 - 0 win and a place in the final , but it was n't long before that joy was tempered by the realization that their neighbors had just endured their darkest hour			2
among the thousands of @entity100 who had ventured 100 miles south to the game at @entity103 , in the city of @entity105 , was a young @entity106			0
@entity106 went on to become a part of @entity4 folklore , making over 500 appearances for the @entity110 and helping them to win the @entity111 in 2005 before retiring last year			2
but before he became a professional footballer , @entity106 was an @entity86 supporter and , like many others , he was unaware of what had unfolded at @entity49			2
" it was in the days before mobile phones , so it was very difficult to know what was going on , really , " says @entity106 , who spent his entire 16 - year playing career with @entity4			2
" we heard reports , stories			0
it was n't just a @entity4 tragedy , it was a @entity4 city tragedy			1
" the @entity86 fans and @entity86 football club have both played a major part in it over the last 25 years and i think the whole city felt it			1
" and there are many still feeling it today			0
relatives of those who died have fought a tireless campaign for justice			0
after a quarter of a century , the end may finally be in sight			0
a fresh inquest into the tragedy began last month after the initial verdict of " accidental death " verdict that had stood for over two decades was quashed in december 2012 by the @entity146			2
a jury will decide on a range of issues relating to that fateful day , including whether police amended statements to deflect blame away from the force and onto @entity4 fans			1
the inquest could run until 2015			0
later this month @entity4 will pay its respects			2
the club will stage a charity match on april 21 , with a host of former players -- including @entity106 and @entity25 -- turning out to raise money for the @entity162			1
" now i 'm not a player i 'll still go , former players go back , " @entity106 says			0
" we 're there to pay our respects to the 96 and also to the families that are there			0
" despite @entity4 's rich and proud history -- five @entity170 cups and 18 @entity68 championships -- @entity25 regrets that the team will always be intrinsically connected to @entity175 football 's darkest day			1
" it 's sad really , but certain disasters do shape football teams , " he says			0
" it 's just sad that you always refer back to disasters			0
