@entity1 , @entity0 -- an internet that gives people the information they want virtually as soon as it 's created is getting closer , according to @entity3 professionals			0
but before real - time web becomes a reality , developers say they need to figure out how to protect people 's privacy while blasting out as much information as they can , as fast as they can			1
" a lot of this data that people would like to make available , they would n't necessarily want to make available to everyone , " said @entity13 , chief technical officer for @entity14 , a search engine that aims to give real - time results			1
" i think we 'll be wrestling with privacy issues around real - time data for a long time			1
" the idea behind a real - time web is to create technology that does n't require an internet user to actively seek out something they 're interested in			1
that could mean anything from getting pinged when an article about your favorite sports team is posted to an alert when you 're mentioned in someone 's blog			0
@entity13 and others speaking at the @entity40 on saturday said there 's not yet fully developed technology that would both give people all the real - time info they want and let people who put their information on the @entity3 select who sees it -- or even take it back			1
" it 's kind of in our best interest , being selfish , if everyone was completely open with their data , " said @entity50 , founder of @entity1 - based @entity51 , a location - based mobile app. " from the user 's perspective , it 's kind of the opposite -- it 's probably better to just stay selfish with your own data but consume everyone else 's			1
" there 's a whole lot of work that needs to be done on this and it has n't been solved yet			2
" for example , if people on @entity72 all set their feed to private , the popular trending - topics feature would n't work			1
recently , @entity72 , on which most users make their information open to everyone , hit a major milestone -- its 10 billionth tweet			2
unfortunately , that tweet was by a user whose settings are private , so the curious will never know what the landmark message was			2
@entity85 , a software developer with @entity86 , said a real - time web would create numerous new opportunities -- among them , giving small , local retailers a chance to catch up with major online stores that capitalize on convenience			1
" if my corner store can say [ to a customer online ] , ' yes , i just got five rickshaw bags in stock and you wanted one -- you can just walk down here and get it , ' it 's a chance to change competition and commerce , " he said			2
on sites like @entity72 , @entity51 and @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109 , status updates already exist as elements of a real - time web			1
developers note that the speed with which information travels on the @entity3 is already dramatically faster than it was just a couple of years ago -- before @entity72 and location - based apps existed and before @entity109 became a worldwide phenomenon			2
" this creates lots of interesting social scenarios , " said @entity118 , of @entity119			0
" in the ' old days , ' you would have written a blog post about something you did and i 'd be like , ' crap , i was in the next room			0
' " multiple players , at both major @entity3 companies and new startups , are working on an internet platform to " real time " the rest of the @entity135			1
that starts with faster searching			0
current search engines " crawl " around the @entity3 -- adding the material they find to their databases			0
but that can sometimes take awhile , particularly on smaller web sites			0
then , there needs to be a universal system for pushing that information to the right people			0
@entity147 suggested there may eventually be a way for every new page of data on the @entity3 to have hashtags ( # ) similar to the ones used on @entity72 to denote that a post is about a particular topic			0
on the issue of privacy , @entity85 said developers could roll out a way for a person to set their online privacy settings in one place then have those settings apply on every web site			1
" we 're going to see a definition , at the technical level , of what sharing means , " @entity85 said			0
" i think we 're going to solve it on the technical level first			0
once we solve it technically , it 'll be about how to actually implement it for users			0

@entity135 could help local retailers catch up with major online stores , developer says
