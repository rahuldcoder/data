-- it started as a dot -- a bright , white star that raced across the @entity4			0
over @entity7 , the dot became a streak that thickened , then spawned smaller streaks -- " little sparklies , " @entity5 recalled			1
then came the sound -- " a big , rolling boom , " she said			0
" the dog started barking like crazy			0
" a decade ago , 200,000 feet above @entity17 's driveway in @entity18 , the space shuttle @entity15 broke apart on re-entry			1
all seven astronauts aboard died			0
friday , @entity21 marks the anniversary with tributes to the crew of @entity15 and 10 other astronauts lost in the space agency 's two previous fatal accidents -- the 1986 explosion that destroyed @entity15 's sister ship @entity30 , and the launch pad fire that killed @entity33 's three - man crew in 1967			1
all three anniversaries fall within a week -- the @entity36 fire on january 27 , @entity30 on january 28 and @entity15 on february 1			1
controllers lost contact with @entity15 at 8:59 a.m. et , about 15 minutes before it had been expected to land at the @entity39 at @entity40 , @entity41			1
shuttle commander @entity43 's wife @entity42 , who was waiting for him there , feared the worst			1
space fan remembers the shuttle 10 years later " i remember looking up at the sky and thinking , ' is that it ? is that the end of @entity43 's life ? ' " she told @entity0			2
in an instant , she was a single mother with two young children			0
she was angry , frustrated			0
but she said @entity21 is " the best of the best			1
" " they 're human			0
they 're flawed , " said @entity57 , who remarried five years ago			0
" they did the best they possibly could			0
nobody maliciously caused this to happen			0
" nevertheless , she said , the grief still lingers			0
" the lord definitely healed our hearts tremendously , but it 's a lifelong process , " she said			2
" i do n't think that pain ever completely goes away			1
" commemorations will also be held in some of the towns where the orbiter 's wreckage rained down that bright saturday morning			1
one of them is @entity74 , @entity7 , about 170 miles north of @entity75 , where a roadside monument and a museum commemorate the disaster and the volunteers who combed the surrounding woods for pieces of the spacecraft			1
space shuttle @entity15 part found in east @entity7 " some of them , you knew instantly what they were , " said @entity84 , one of those searchers			1
" we would find some of the instrument panel that was in the shuttle cockpit			0
you could still see the numbers and the switches			0
you knew that if you found a can of caviar with @entity99 on the back of it , you know it 's not supposed to be in the woods			2
" the remains of the shuttle 's crew were found near @entity74 , along with the nose , part of the landing gear and much of the cabin			2
in addition , two members of a helicopter crew engaged in the search were killed in a crash the following month			2
gay now leads the @entity116			0
unlike @entity17 , whose space buff sister - in - law called her outside that morning , she was getting ready for a relative 's baby shower and did n't see the breakup			1
" my house started vibrating , and the pictures on the wall started shaking , and then i heard two sonic booms , " she said			0
" we knew something was up			0
" gay 's husband was president of the local @entity131 chapter , and she led the group 's @entity132			2
@entity74 's @entity131 hall was quickly turned into a dining hall for the search teams , and it will host lunch for the guests at friday 's ceremony			1
overall , @entity21 recovered about 84,000 pieces of the orbiter , about 40 % of the craft , scattered from the @entity7 panhandle to @entity144 , @entity145			1
pieces turned up as late as 2011 , when the state 's brutal drought uncovered an aluminum fuel tank on the bottom of @entity18			2
an investigation determined @entity15 was doomed almost from the instant its 16 - day mission began			1
a piece of insulating foam from its external fuel tank broke away , striking and cracking a panel on the orbiter 's left wing			2
the damaged panel allowed searing hot gases to seep into the wing on re-entry , causing the craft to lose control and disintegrate			2
the three surviving shuttles returned to space starting in 2005			0
the last mission was in 2011 , thirty years after @entity15 -- the first of the class -- made its maiden voyage			2
@entity21 and the families of the crew decided to preserve its wreckage , which now sits on the 16th floor of the massive @entity176 at @entity40			1
for scientists , it 's a " treasure trove " that lets them study the material used in the spacecraft , said @entity181 , the caretaker of the orbiter 's remains			0
and for young @entity21 workers , it 's a place to see firsthand why failure ca n't be an option			1
" when you actually walk amongst @entity15 and you talk about the accident and you talk about the lessons learned and how you can do the best job you can do to help prevent this from ever happening again , that 's very powerful , " @entity181 said			1
