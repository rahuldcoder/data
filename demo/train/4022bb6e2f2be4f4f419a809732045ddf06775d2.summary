@entity0 -- violence is n't always physical -- and @entity5 home secretary @entity4 's recent announcements on all things extradition fell one after another as devastating blows to an already beaten and broken @entity9 community			1
the extraditions of five @entity9 men to the @entity12 on october 5 followed by the blocking of computer hacker @entity15 's extradition this week has made the @entity9 communities of the @entity5 wake up to a glaring reality many tried hard to avoid			1
it is something other communities in the @entity5 have lived and understood for decades			1
some @entity21 have taken the beatings , repeated anti-terror laws , stops and searches , detentions without charge , demonization of beliefs and values , denigration of the personalities and principles most loved by us , and unrelenting social discrimination -- often believing that by showing more love they will somehow change the attitude of their aggressor			2
campaigners against the extradition of some of the men waved @entity43 flags at protests and called on a concept of citizenship , that clearly was n't shared by the powers that be			0
others have called out state and institutionalized racism for what it is			0
others still , left without good leadership have just tried to get by , aggrieved , but without outlet for their legitimate concerns , pariahs in a society whose legal system has been exported worldwide through colonial endeavor , and continues to oppress in the name of freedom and now human rights			0
this may sound overly angry , but it captures a new mood -- one that has been a long time coming			0
the differences in treatment are so stark and spring from long - rooted ( mis ) representation of all things @entity9			1
the @entity5 media discussed ad infinitum the violation of @entity15 's human rights by the proposed extradition , but when the @entity21 were extradited all discussion revolved around why it took so long			1
there is no doubt that @entity15 and his family have suffered inordinately and very few in the @entity5 would begrudge the decision to block his removal to the @entity12			1
but , as the families of all those awaiting extradition will testify , it is a shared experience			0
while @entity15 was granted bail during his decade - long ordeal , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 endured from six to 14 years in prison without charge			2
they suffered too , as did their families , yet they are rarely named			0
on the day of their final legal challenges , all reporting focused on the case of " @entity91 and four others			0
" @entity91 , for many years an exemplar caricature for most of the stereotypical attributes of @entity21 , is the poster boy for successive governments ' capitulation of sovereignty and equality in the @entity5 - @entity12 extradition treaty of 2003			1
demonization of @entity21 preceded 9/11 , in the @entity5 as elsewhere			1
@entity113 is just one of many organizations , academics , journalists highlighting @entity119 bias and depictions in everything from news media to literary classics , through @entity125 movies and even @entity126			0
the normality of such depictions -- violent men , compliant highly sexualized oppressed women , irrational beliefs and exotic behavioural codes have had serious impact			0
the extradition of @entity95 and the reprieve of @entity15 are just two of the products of this process			2
as one of the " four others " it has mattered little that @entity95 's case has more in common with @entity15 's than @entity91 's , except that @entity15 admitted he did hack into the @entity144 's computers , whereas @entity95 denies guilt of the cybercrimes he is accused of			2
both suffer from @entity148 , both were assessed as a suicide risk , one is seen to have his human rights violated by the extradition treaty , while in the other it is clear he is not deemed to be human			0
in short , the one word answer to the question " @entity156 , not @entity15 ? " racism			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159 .			2

@entity5 extradited 5 @entity21 to @entity12 on oct. 5 , but let computer hacker @entity15 stay
differences in treatment spring from ( mis ) representation of @entity21 , says @entity159
@entity159 : racism is the only reason why @entity15 , but not the @entity21 , was reprieved
