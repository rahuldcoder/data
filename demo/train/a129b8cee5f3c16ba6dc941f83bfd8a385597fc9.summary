-- we all like to think medical care is about science , but too often it 's about professional interests			0
last week , a 25 - year follow - up of the @entity7 was published -- one of the eight major randomized trials of screening mammography			1
the headline was simple : mammogram screenings do n't reduce cancer death rates			1
the reaction by some @entity16 mammographers was predictable -- discredit the study			2
it 's predictable because it is exactly what they did when they did n't like the first findings of the study published more than 20 years ago			1
the effort by the @entity26 to discredit the @entity28 trial relies on two allegations : the investigators were cheating : let 's look at the background on this			1
randomized trials are a critical tool for clinical researchers			2
study participants are placed at random in either one group ( in this case those who get mammograms ) or the other ( those who do not )			2
who is in which group is solely based on the play of chance -- a flip of a coin			0
the allegation of cheating -- purposely putting women whom researchers knew had advanced cancers in the mammography group -- is an incredibly serious one			1
it sure was taken seriously by @entity28 's @entity56			1
it launched a two - year independent review of the entire randomization process			0
in 1997 , the review found no credible evidence of cheating			1
but that did n't stop the allegation from being trotted out last week			2
the new study provides evidence that randomization did exactly what it is supposed to do : it created two identical groups of women			1
the rate of death in the two groups was exactly the same , every year , for 25 years			0
that ca n't happen by cheating -- that can only happen when the groups are formed solely by chance			1
@entity28 is a @entity80 country : more specifically , the @entity28 used old mammography machines that produced inadequate images , interpreted by inadequate mammographers			1
it sounded as if @entity28 were @entity85 , as if the nation had only recently gotten electric power and was still struggling to train doctors			1
for mammographers who need to point to the benefits demonstrated by earlier trials of mammography , this is an odd allegation			2
why ? because the other trials used even older technology			0
in fact , one of the trials most favorable to screening -- the @entity99 of @entity100 's -- dates from two decades before @entity28 's , in the early 1960s , when mammography technologies were primitive			1
yet , in both @entity100 and @entity28 , outmoded technology did exactly what it was supposed to do			1
it found small breast cancers			0
armed with these two allegations , the mammographers followed a well - worn strategy : make the allegations often and loudly enough and maybe they will stick			0
to be clear , not all mammographers share this view			0
a new generation has openly acknowledged the problems of mammography			0
but many in the old guard are more likely to attack any suggestion that screening does n't work as well as advertised , characterizing researchers who raise the possibility as " malicious " or " dangerous " and questioning the editorial policies of the journals that publish their work			1
it 's time to stop the unfounded allegations			0
it might be standard procedure for politics but not for science			0
too much energy has been devoted to discrediting the @entity28 study and not enough to understanding it			1
to make sense of information the @entity28 trial offers , you need to understand its unique design -- specifically what is being compared with what			1
most of the other randomized trials simply compared regular mammography with doing nothing			0
in the @entity28 trial , one group received a regular physical exam of the breast -- a very careful exam performed by specially trained nurses			1
the other group received the same regular physical exam plus regular mammography			0
in other words , the trial tested the usefulness of adding mammography to a physical exam in an effort to detect abnormalities that are too small to feel			0
and the trial showed that finding these " too small to feel " abnormalities does n't help women live longer			1
that 's really important information			0
it does n't mean that mammography ca n't help at all -- it is extremely challenging to standardize a physical exam of the breast across an entire population			2
it does mean , however , that if we are going to do mammography , we should be using it to find big , important things -- not small , unimportant things			0
further , the @entity28 trial confirms that the harm of being overdiagnosed by screening mammography is real : one in five invasive cancers found by screening represents overdiagnosis			1
overdiagnosis happens when cellular abnormalities meet the pathologic definition of " cancer , " yet never progress to cause clinical disease			0
overdiagnosed women are told they have cancer , are treated for cancer , yet their " cancer " is not destined to cause them any problems			2
it is important to recognize this estimate does n't include the smallest , earliest form of breast cancer found only by mammography -- ductal carcinoma in situ or @entity198			1
if overdiagnosis is a problem in invasive cancer , you can imagine it might be a greater problem for a smaller , earlier form of cancer			2
even mammography 's old guard objects to having @entity198 included in estimates of the amount of overdiagnosis			0
why do they object ? because so much of @entity198 represents overdiagnosis , including it makes the estimate even higher			0
it 's time to get the science back in screening mammography and to recognize that mammographers may not be the ideal source for balanced information			2
it 's too much like asking the dentists for balanced information about routine dental x-rays			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			2

a recent @entity28 study found that mammogram screenings do n't reduce cancer deaths
@entity234 *slammed* it , saying researchers cheated and screening machines were old
@entity228 : cheating charges unfounded , and *pro-screening* studies used older machines
@entity228 : the real problem is that mammography *results* in women getting treatment they do n't need
