-- a @entity1 prowling the fairways may be a familiar sight , but at a golf club in @entity6 it is a fox that has emerged as a new star of the game			1
the antics of a red fox cub at the @entity13 's par three @entity12 course have sparked the sort of global media interest golf 's big cat @entity1 might be proud of			1
" the story has gone around the world , " the club 's director @entity17 told @entity0			0
" it 's very , very funny			0
" the fox comes every day at the end of the afternoon between four and six o'clock			1
" he 's running around in between holes one and six waiting for the players to hit the ball and then directly he is running after the ball and running away with it in his mouth			0
" he has a nice red coat			0
he 's very young and is alone with no other fox			1
" nicknamed " @entity33 , " the young fox has been arriving for its regular late afternoon round for the last month			1
and , rather than being hunted down , the fox is proving to be good for business			1
" people are very interested and many people come in the afternoon to see the animal , " @entity17 explained			0
" we live in the mountains so it 's usual to see animals ; we have dogs and cats which sometimes come			0
" but it 's not very common to see a savage animal coming so close to people who play on the golf course			1
it 's very , very special for us			0
" my colleague @entity51 who looks after the restaurant tells me she has more people in between four and six o'clock for when the fox comes			2
" see you later , alligator the appearance of a three - legged alligator at this year 's @entity60 in @entity61 gave a new meaning to the golfing term water hazard , while a herd of hopping kangaroos at the @entity68 ' @entity67 in @entity69 provided an interesting wildlife distraction for spectators			2
explore the world 's most extreme courses but the golfers in @entity6 are at ease with the regular appearance of their four - legged friend at @entity78			0
" of course the fox is disturbing the game , " @entity17 continued			2
" but people are not angry at all			0
" he is just trying to play with the golfers			0
" the only downside seems to be the cost of losing all those golf balls			1
the club estimates that @entity33 has snaffled more than 100 balls			1
tricky little fox " we do not know where the balls are , " admitted @entity17			1
" he has a few holes around the golf course			2
people have looked for them but no chance			0
" it 's more a game for the fox			2
he is tricky -- but we like the little fox			2
" nestled in the @entity107 , the village of @entity78 is expecting its first snow fall in november for its prestigious ski season ahead			1
the approaching winter will close the golf course at the beginning of the month and that means the club 's newest player faces an uncertain future			1
" in the winter , he will stay more in his hole in the earth , " @entity17 predicted			0
" maybe next spring we will see the fox			2
we will see ... "			0

a fox who waits to catch golf balls has become an *unwitting* video star
