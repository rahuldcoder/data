-- talk about a hefty baggage fee : for months now i have not been able to get the $ 27,100 suitcase out of my mind			1
people are out of work			1
yet the $ 27,100 suitcase exists			1
it 's not a joke			1
at first i thought it was			1
last fall i was traveling through @entity13 , @entity14 , and a cover line on a glossy local magazine caught my eye			2
the magazine was called @entity18 , and the cover line said : " the $ 58,000 brooch ... the $ 27,100 suitcase ... check out our luxury file			1
" perhaps , i thought , this was a teaser to a satirical story using literary exaggeration to whistle past the graveyard of @entity28 's fiscal hard times			1
but when i flipped open the magazine , the feature seemed to be serious			2
the $ 27,100 suitcase , the story said , was sold by @entity32 , the luxury retailer , which has a store in @entity13			1
the suitcase was called the @entity35 , and was " constructed of @entity37 canvas with @entity39 calfskin			1
" i closed the magazine , but could not stop thinking about the suitcase			1
a suitcase is something that gets banged around			1
it sits out in the rain and snow on airport runways			2
baggage handlers toss it roughly onto conveyer belts			2
sometimes it gets lost on flights			2
why would anyone pay $ 27,100 for a suitcase ? weighty and important matters dominated the news			1
but there it was , always in the back of my mind : the suitcase , and the parallel world of wealth it represented			1
over the holidays , i was in @entity66			2
one morning i walked to the @entity32 store at the corner of 62nd street and @entity69			2
i took a deep breath and walked in			0
" may i help you ? " a clerk asked			0
" i 'd like to see the $ 27,000 suitcase , " i said			1
( i shaved $ 100 off the price ; the phrase sounded smoother that way			1
) " which bag specifically ? " she said			0
" you have more than one that costs that much ? " i said			0
" there was one that cost $ 200,000 , " she said			1
" " why would someone spend that kind of money on a suitcase ? " i said			2
" hand - stitching , " she said			0
" she looked around , as if to be certain no one was listening , then half - whispered : " i use my @entity96			0
" she said that the $ 27,100 suitcase was not , on that day , on floor display			1
i left @entity66 , still mulling : how could a person take such a suitcase on a trip ? it would be like putting a baggage tag on $ 27,100 in cash			1
at @entity105 in @entity106 , i went in the slush and slop to @entity110 ' curbside baggage - check area to commiserate with my baggage - handler friends there			0
i told them the story			0
i would like to report their response , but it was so cold outside , and they were so bundled up head to toe , that all i could discern was their muffled laughter			0
in recent days i was in southwest @entity14 again			0
this time i went to the @entity32 store there , in the elegant @entity126 outdoor mall			0
" i 'm interested in the $ 27,000 suitcase , " i said to the first clerk i saw			1
she absolutely beamed , and i immediately realized she had mistaken my intentions			0
" no , " i said			0
" no. i do n't want to buy it			0
" the wattage of her smiled dimmed a bit			0
she said i would have to give her more information about the product ; she said some specially made @entity32 bags sold for $ 40,000 or $ 50,000			2
" the people who pay that much for a bag usually fly on jets , " she said			1
" most people fly on jets , " i said			2
she gave me a do n't - be - dense look			0
" oh , " i said , surmising that , in these circles , " jets " was a synonym for " private jets			0
" back in my hotel room , i called @entity32 ' @entity28 corporate headquarters			0
there , a spokeswoman , @entity151 , said that for many customers , only the best that money can buy will do			0
" they want the finest , " she said			0
" she said that for people who might spend $ 27,000 on a work of art , $ 27,000 for a suitcase is not excessive			1
" if they want it , the price is not a big concern			0
" she said that the $ 27,100 @entity35 suitcase is actually a twinned piece of luggage : two compartments carried by a single handle			1
for a customer on a tight budget , a single @entity35 compartment can be bought by itself			0
i ended my quest where it began : at @entity174 , where i had seen the original mention			0
i called the editor - in - chief , @entity176 , to ask if he thought his readers had greeted the item about the suitcase with a shake of the head			1
" some probably did , " he said			0
" but i 'm sure there were others who saw it and thought : ' i 'd like to have that bag			2
' we have a very high - demographic readership			0
" i will leave you with this thought			2
at that @entity32 store in @entity66 , i asked the clerk why someone would pay so much for a suitcase that would inevitably get scuffed and scratched in transit			1
" some people buy metal cases in which to enclose their suitcases , " she said			2
she saw the disbelief in my eyes , smiled , and said : " they buy suitcases for their suitcases			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			1

@entity205 saw an ad for a $ *27k* suitcase and thought it was a joke
even in difficult economic times , extravagant luxury *goods* are for sale , he says
he asks why people would pay so much for an item that gets *jostled* around and endures all *weather*
