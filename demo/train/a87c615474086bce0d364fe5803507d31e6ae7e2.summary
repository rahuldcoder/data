-- @entity1 teenagers @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 are having trouble not sleeping : they 're knocking back coffee , popping pills , anything to delay another date with their dream stalker ( which may explain why these high school students look like college grads )			0
when one of them does drop off , the bedsheets turn red			0
@entity22 's 1984 slumber party massacre started from scratch -- it was a low - budget item from what was then a genuine independent studio , @entity26 -- and became the iconic horror franchise of the decade			1
with his battered fedora , a striped sweater , a razor - glove and a face like @entity34 , @entity29 was the most personable boogie man @entity35 had come up with in a long time , so what if he was also a child abuser ? a recurring nightmare who stalked teenagers as they slept , @entity29 preyed on the defenseless and played fast and loose with physics : if @entity44 had created a slasher movie villain , he might have come up with someone like @entity29			2
after eight movies , a tv series and a comic book , you might think mr. @entity29 had been done to death			2
it 's been seven years since @entity29 put @entity53 in his place ( in " @entity55 " )			1
but you ca n't keep a good bad guy down , and at the rate @entity35 is cannibalizing its horror back catalogue , we 'll be seeing remakes of the remakes any day now			0
directed by pop video director @entity64 and written by @entity65 and @entity66 , the new " @entity67 " is actually a lot like the old one			1
so much so , for a while you wonder why they did n't just re-release it			0
( you 'll wish they had			0
) surprisingly , @entity75 does n't go the @entity77 route and give it a high - gloss , @entity81 tempo , but in duplicating the most memorable bits from the original ( the glove in the bath , for instance , and the face coming through the wallpaper ) , he fails to put his own stamp on it			1
as @entity29 , @entity91 , who was @entity92 nominated for playing a sex offender in " @entity94 " ( and who went on to play @entity96 in " @entity97 " and the battered psychopath @entity99 in " @entity100 " ) finds @entity101 a tough act to follow			1
@entity91 drops his voice an octave and comes on heavy -- this @entity29 mostly keeps his quips to himself -- but he 's significantly shorter than @entity101 , and the make - up suggests nothing so much as @entity108 in " @entity109 " : the scarecrow who did n't even scare the crows			1
@entity113 gives new " nightmare " an " a " branching out tentatively toward something new , the film toys with repressed memory syndrome and the intriguing suggestion that maybe @entity29 was innocent ; that he has every right to be angry about the lynch mob that incinerated him			2
i 'll leave you to imagine how far the filmmakers go with that radical notion , but maybe a prequel would have been a more rewarding way to go ? the new " nightmare " also proudly introduces a clinical - sounding term called " micro-naps , " a side effect of sleep deprivation that handily justifies more shock effects even as the number of survivors is whittled down to two ( gratifyingly , they 're the least synthetic of the young cast members )			0
but is it scary ? barely			0
in the wake of " @entity140 , " @entity29 's grandstanding theatrics seem pretty old hat			1
there is nothing about this redundant remake to give anyone sleepless nights , unless it 's threat of yet more of the same old same old			2
enough with the " re-imagining , " @entity35 ; just imagine !			0

director @entity64 *struggles* to put own stamp on @entity22 's 1984 original
@entity91 , as @entity29 , finds @entity101 a tough act to follow
in wake of " *paranormal* activity , " @entity29 's theatrics seem pretty old hat
