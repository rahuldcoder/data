-- in dueling speeches that sought to frame the economic debate for their election showdown in november , president @entity5 and @entity6 on thursday offered differing visions for how to restore strong growth while telling separate @entity10 crowds that the other 's policies have failed			1
the president and the former @entity15 governor both emphasized particular themes of community in their campaign speeches in a battleground state hit hard by the 2008 recession and its aftermath			1
@entity6 , speaking at a factory in the @entity24 area minutes before @entity5 's speech in @entity26 , focused on what he called the president 's failure to deliver promised economic growth so far in his first term			1
" talk is cheap , " @entity6 , the certain @entity32 nominee , said of the incumbent @entity34 president			1
" action speaks very loud , and if you want to see the results of his economic policies , look around @entity10 and the country			1
" he encouraged voters to ask their friends and neighbors if they are better off since @entity5 became president , predicting that small business owners , bankers , unemployed college graduates and others will answer no. @entity5 , meanwhile , emphasized the election is about a choice for the direction of the country , saying @entity6 " and his allies in @entity55 " advocate the same economic policies of tax cuts and deregulation that brought the recent recession			1
he cited in particular the refusal by congressional @entity32 to accept any kind of tax increase on the wealthy , saying that stance prevented a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement last year			2
" the only thing that can break the stalemate is you , " @entity5 said to cheers			2
" this november is your chance to render a verdict on the debate over how to grow the economy , how to create good jobs , how to pay down our deficit			0
" the nearly simultaneous addresses reflected what polls have consistently shown -- the economy is the top issue in the november presidential election -- and both campaigns continued their high - stakes efforts to seize the advantage on it			0
@entity5 has been rocked by bad economic news in recent weeks , including a tepid may jobs report and thursday 's news that first - time unemployment claims rose slightly last week			2
last friday , the president provided fuel to @entity6 's repeated claims that he is out of touch and his policies have been ineffective by telling reporters that compared to the public sector , the private sector " is doing fine			1
" @entity5 clarifies : economy ' not doing fine ' a new @entity6 campaign ad thursday replays the president uttering the phrase several times while highlighting the nation 's economic woes by flashing on - screen text : " 23.2 million @entity106 are unemployed , " " 40 straight months over 8 % unemployment " and " middle - class struggles deepen under @entity5			1
" the spot is the first negative ad against @entity5 by the @entity6 camp so far in the general election campaign , although @entity113 backing @entity6 have run attack ads against the president			1
@entity5 tried to play down the rough patch , telling the raucous @entity118 crowd that the campaign will be long and tough			2
" over the next five months , this election will take many twists and many turns , polls will go up and polls will go down , there will be no shortage of gaffes and controversies that keep both campaigns busy and give the press something to write about , " he said , adding with a smile that " you may have heard i recently made my own unique contribution to that process			0
" as the audience laughed , @entity5 added : " it was n't the first time			2
it wo n't be the last			0
" he summed up the @entity32 campaign as an attack against his presidency , saying the " scary voice " in television and @entity6 himself will " tell you the economy is bad , that it is all my fault , that i ca n't fix it because i think government is always the answer or because i did n't make a lot of money in the private sector and do n't understand it , or because i am in over my head , or because i think everybody is doing just fine			1
" " that may be their plan to win the election but it is not a plan to create jobs , " @entity5 said			2
" it is not a plan to grow the economy			0
" he cited the ravages of the recession on the economy and highlighted progress made by his administration , being careful to note that people are still hurting and more needs to happen			0
at the same time , @entity5 offered his oft - repeated call for a balanced approach to economic growth and deficit reduction that raises taxes on the wealthy and holds down spending while ensuring that critical areas for future growth such as education , clean energy and infrastructure development get needed money			2
in his speech , @entity6 also stuck with his stump themes , saying @entity5 blew his chance to fix the economy and now it is time for change			1
" my experience in thinking about people who i want to have work for me , whether it 's my doctor or the person that 's going to be painting the house , i want to make sure they did a good job the first time and if they did n't , i want someone who can do a better job , " @entity6 said			2
a survey released thursday showed that more @entity106 blame former president @entity205 than @entity5 for the continuing economic problems that began in the previous administration			2
according to the @entity210 poll , 68 % of respondents said @entity205 deserves either a great deal or a moderate amount of blame , compared with 31 % who said the former president deserves not much or no blame at all			2
in the survey , 52 % said @entity5 deserves blame , with 48 % saying he is n't to blame for current economic conditions			0
another poll shows independent voters are dissatisfied with the economic plans of both candidates			1
according to the @entity226 / @entity225 survey released wednesday , 54 % of independents have an unfavorable view of @entity5 's plan for the economy , and 47 % view @entity6 's economic plan unfavorably			1
it says 38 % view @entity5 's plan favorably , compared with 35 % who feel the same about @entity6 's plan			1
the survey showing negative marks for each candidate 's economic plan reflected strong racial divides among @entity106			0
white voters were split on @entity6 's plan , with 42 % viewing it favorably and 42 % viewing it unfavorably			1
minority voters were far less positive , with 68 % of black voters and 48 % of @entity247 voters viewing the @entity32 candidate 's plan unfavorably			1
both groups gave much higher marks to @entity5 -- 81 % of black voters and 59 % of @entity247 voters had a favorable view of the @entity256 incumbent 's plan			1
@entity6 's policies reflect the @entity32 goal of shrinking government and cutting taxes to reduce the mounting federal deficit and national debt			1
led by conservatives , @entity32 argue such steps will boost economic growth to bring in more revenue -- despite the tax cuts -- and shrink the deficit			0
@entity5 calls for ending @entity205 - era tax cuts for families making more than $ 250,000 a year as well as tax breaks for the oil industry and others to increase revenue , while also holding down spending and seeking long - term entitlement reforms			0
both parties and presidential campaigns have been guilty of making dubious claims about the other as the campaign rhetoric has heated up			0
@entity282 , the editor of the @entity284 winning web site @entity285 , said his recent fact - checks of the candidates have rated nearly all of their claims to be half - truths			0
" the campaigns are cherry - picking statistics that do n't tell a full story , " @entity282 said			0
@entity294 with the @entity295 said ad distortions from both candidates in both parties are typical of a campaign that has " specialized in taking words out of context			0
" @entity294 's office launched its own fact - checking site , @entity304 , to police campaign ads for their distortions			0
the web site features a montage of television spots that are guilty of using a wide array of deceptive techniques			0
" the danger is people hear the sound bite repeated in ads , see it repeated in the news , and lose track of the original context , " @entity294 said			0
" it becomes the reality and in the process , there 's a serious deception			0
" @entity0 's @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 , @entity329 and @entity330 contributed to this report .			0
