-- a testy exchange erupted on thursday between sen. @entity2 and joint chiefs chairman gen. @entity3 during the latter 's testimony about september 's deadly attack on the @entity8 diplomatic mission in @entity9 , @entity10			1
" gen. @entity3 , i was just going over your written statement and i have to admit it 's one of the more bizarre statements that i have ever seen in my years in this committee , " @entity2 said , referring to the @entity11			1
thursday 's testimony is the latest in a string of accounts to congressional committees about the attacks , which occurred september 11 and resulted in the deaths of four @entity8 , including @entity8 ambassador to @entity10 @entity24			1
" when you 're talking about the @entity9 issue , you say , ' we positioned our forces in a way that was informed by and consistent with available threat estimates , ' " @entity2 continued			1
" then you go on to say , ' our military was appropriately responsive , ' even though seven hours passed and two @entity8 died at the end of that			1
then you go on and say , ' we did what our posture and capabilities allowed			0
' " @entity2 said a base in @entity38 was just 90 minutes away			2
" we could have placed forces there , " he said			0
" we could have had aircraft and other capabilities a short distance away at @entity44 , @entity38			0
so , for you to testify before this committee that they were consistent with available threat estimates is simply false ; that our military was appropriately responsive			0
" " i stand by my testimony , your dispute of it notwithstanding , " @entity3 replied			2
@entity2 countered , " well , perhaps you can give me some facts that would substantiate it			2
" @entity3 then said that a contingent was not sent because the @entity55 did n't request one			1
" so it 's the @entity55 's fault , " @entity2 challenged			2
" i 'm not blaming the @entity55 , " @entity3 responded			2
" i 'm sure they had their own assessment			0
" @entity3 said he stood by the conclusion of an independent review board , which concluded the " interagency response was timely and appropriate , but there simply was not enough time , given the speed of the attacks , for armed @entity8 military assets to have made a difference			1
" the board has made 29 recommendations , all of which have been accepted by the @entity55			0
later in his testimony , @entity3 told sen. @entity73 , that the bases in the @entity75 have aircraft , which " was n't the right tool for the particular threat we faced			1
" @entity3 noted that , at the time , he was also concerned with other potential flashpoints -- @entity81 , @entity82 ; @entity83 , @entity84 ; @entity85 and @entity86 , @entity87 ; @entity88 , @entity89 ; and @entity90 , @entity91			2
" we had some pretty significant intel threat streams against those places as well , " he said			0
but @entity2 said he had seen the threat estimates " and none of them rose to the level of the threat in @entity9 ... that they could not withstand a sustained attack			1
" in response to a question from sen. @entity106 , @entity107 , defense secretary @entity103 said he was aware of a cable sent in august by @entity24 that said security in @entity9 was not adequate			1
" unfortunately , there was no specific intelligence or indications of an imminent attack on that -- @entity8 facilities in @entity9 , " @entity103 said			1
" and frankly without an adequate warning , there was not enough time given the speed of the attack for armed military assets to respond			0
" he also noted that the @entity123 had identified some 281 threats to @entity8 diplomats , diplomatic facilities , embassies , ambassadors and consulates during the six months before the attack in @entity9			1
" and to deal with that , i mean , that 's not our responsibility , " he said			0
" that 's the @entity55 's responsibility			0
" @entity103 said that @entity8 officials learned in the months after the incident that " there were actually two short - duration attacks that occurred some six hours apart , " the first on the consulate and the second on an annex two miles away			1
" the bottom line is this : that we were not dealing with a prolonged or continuous assault , which could have been brought to an end by a @entity8 military response , very simply , although we had forces deployed to the region , " he said			2
@entity3 said he could not have gotten troops on the ground within 13 to 15 hours			2
@entity103 was firm throughout his testimony that there were no " undue delays " in decision making and there was no denial of support from @entity158 or from the military combatant commanders when the attack happened			1
" quite the contrary : the safe evacuation of all @entity8 government personnel from @entity9 12 hours after the initial attack " and transfer to the @entity170 in @entity171 " was the result of exceptional @entity8 government coordination			1
" he said the @entity8 military response helped save lives			2
@entity175 's talk with @entity103 in the months since the attacks , @entity158 has been a center of debate about how much the @entity55 had known about threats in the region and whether , after the attacks , the administration tried to mislead the public about its nature			1
an independent review released in december lambasted the @entity55 , saying " systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies " led to inadequate security at the @entity9 post			2
in his remarks , @entity103 said the initial reports of the attack were given " almost immediately " to the @entity194 in the @entity10 capital of @entity196			1
within 17 minutes , @entity103 said , an unarmed , unmanned surveillance aircraft was dispatched to give @entity8 officials a better idea of what was happening			1
it arrived at the site about 70 minutes after the attack , he said			0
soon , @entity103 and @entity3 met with president @entity175 , the secretary told lawmakers			1
@entity175 ordered that the @entity206 respond to the attack with " all available @entity206 assets " and try to protect @entity8 personnel , @entity103 said			1
@entity106 and sen. @entity210 , @entity212 - @entity211 asked how many times @entity175 spoke with @entity103 and @entity3 after learning about the attack			1
once , in a half - hour conversation with the president , the men said ; @entity175 did not personally get back in touch with them to ask how the mission to help personnel in @entity9 was going			2
" do you think it 's a typical response of the president of the @entity8 to make one phone call , do what you can and never call you back again and ask you , ' how is it going , by the way ? ' " @entity210 asked			2
@entity103 replied , " the president is well - informed about what is going on , make no mistake about it			2
" " was any airplane launched in the world before the attack was concluded ? " @entity210 asked			0
" if you 're talking about a strike aircraft , no , senator , " @entity3 said			1
" did anybody leave any base anywhere to go to the aid of the people under attack in @entity9 , @entity10 , before the attack ended ? " @entity210 asked			1
" no , " @entity103 responded			2
" because the attack ended			0
" orders without action but orders to prepare had been given , the defense secretary testified			0
@entity103 said a @entity249 security team platoon stationed in @entity250 was ordered to prepare for deployment while another platoon prepped to head to the embassy in @entity196			2
a @entity256 , then training in @entity255 , was told to prepare to deploy to a staging base in @entity258 , and another @entity260 force , based in the @entity8 , was told to prepare to move there , too			0
" some have asked why other types of armed aircraft were not dispatched to @entity9 , " he said			1
armed drones , ac - 130 gunships or fixed - wing fighters with the associated tanking , armaments , targeting and support capabilities were not near @entity10 , and it would have taken at least nine hours to deploy , he said			0
" this was , pure and simple , in the absence , as i said -- of any kind of advance warning -- a problem of distance and time , " @entity103 said			0
the quickest response option available was a @entity196 - based security team , he said			0
within hours , @entity103 said , that six - person team , including two @entity8 military personnel , chartered a plane and flew to @entity9			1
within 15 minutes of arriving at the annex facility , they came under attack by mortar and rocket - propelled grenades , he said			0
members of the team and others at the annex facility provided emergency medical assistance and supported the evacuation of all personnel			0
all remaining @entity8 government employees were evacuated from @entity9 , @entity103 said			1
beefing up security there will " always be tension " between how much security is adequate and how much would create a " bunker - like mentality " at global posts , @entity103 said			0
the answer is not to assign the military to run a " fire house " next to every @entity8 diplomatic location			0
@entity103 noted that @entity305 , too , plays a role in the security of the nation 's diplomatic missions , and that the @entity206 faces the prospect of sequestration -- which would result in billions of dollars of cutbacks to the defense budget -- on march 1			0
" if @entity305 fails to act , sequestration is triggered , " he said			0
@entity103 also said there must be some reliance on host countries to help with security			0
the attack in @entity9 " raises concerns " about whether that 's always possible			1
@entity10 's government has been on shaky ground since @entity10 leader @entity324 was ousted in 2011			0
the defense secretary 's testimony comes a few weeks after @entity327 told lawmakers that the @entity55 was moving fast to beef up security at @entity8 posts worldwide			0
during her testimony , @entity327 teared up as she recounted meeting the arrival of the caskets containing the bodies of @entity24 and former @entity336 commandos @entity335 and @entity337 , both of whom had been working as diplomatic security officers			0
@entity341 , the fourth @entity8 killed , was an information management officer			1
@entity103 said an @entity344 team that includes @entity346 and @entity206 members " has made very good progress " in identifying the attackers .			0

aircraft " was n't the right tool , " @entity3 says
@entity353 chairman and sen. @entity2 *square* off in testy exchange
@entity103 says he did n't receive any specific threats related to @entity9 before attack
