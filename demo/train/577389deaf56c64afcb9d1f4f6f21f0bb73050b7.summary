diving 27 meters underwater , the light turns a deep , hazy blue			2
emerging from the darkness , three ballerinas in white tutus stretch their legs on the deck of a sunken military ship			2
it 's not a ghostly apparition but one of a series of haunting photographs displayed in the only underwater gallery of its kind in the world			1
the 12 sumptuous images of everyday scenes -- from a housewife hanging out washing to a teenager watching tv -- take place against the eerie backdrop of sunken ship @entity27 general @entity26			1
the 10,000 ton ship -- located off the coast of @entity35 -- functions as both the backdrop in these evocative photographs and , for a time , the gallery wall on which they 're hung			1
" divers must have been checking their oxygen levels to make sure they were n't seeing things , " said @entity38 , executive director of @entity39 , which showed the @entity41 exhibition			2
" diving is already a dreamlike experience and i think these images really correspond with what people imagine an underwater world might look like			2
" viennese artist @entity51 , who worked as an advertising photographer for more than 20 years , took the powerful images while on a diving exhibition last year			1
sunk just off @entity56 , an island in the @entity57 , in 2009 , the @entity55 is the second - largest artificial reef in the world , attracting a diverse range of marine animals and plant life			2
but before her most recent reincarnation as a divers ' paradise , the historic vessel cruised the waves as a @entity69 transport ship during @entity70 it was this rich history that gave @entity51 the inspiration for his unique @entity70 era scenes			1
the 45 - year - old artist used specialist underwater cameras to capture the ship , before heading back to the studio to photograph models in 1940s and 1950s costumes			1
the retro scenes were then superimposed over the top of the @entity55 , creating an eerie underwater world frozen in time			1
" it 's like bringing the @entity55 back to life , " @entity51 said			1
" it 's a huge empty ship with fish swimming around -- at 27 meters below the surface , the sunlight is this beautiful blue green color			2
i shot the models in the studio with the same lens , so the images matched			0
" around 10,000 divers visited the underwater exhibition and now , after four months sitting on the ocean floor , the unique pictures have come up for air , displayed in their first exhibition on land			1
despite being protected between two sheets of plexiglass and sealed with silicon in a steel frame , the images were not left completely untouched by the ravishes of the ocean			0
the all - pervasive sea water still left its mark , seeping into the frames and discoloring them with salt stains and algae			0
" when we brought the photographs to the surface we found all this growth on them -- it 's a third dimension on top , " @entity51 said			0
" the sea life had created new images			0
it 's very cool , they almost look like @entity123			0
" the remarkable pictures , worth up to $ 30,000 , had crossed the realm from photographs to performance art , said @entity38			0
" the extra layer of growth tells the story of their voyage to the bottom of the seabed , " he added			0
" when they were first brought into the gallery and unpacked , this intense smell went through the building like a windstorm			0
they feel like living objects			0
" while the @entity55 photographs attract art lovers on land , @entity51 's latest underwater project is bewitching divers again -- this time off the coast of @entity148			1
displayed on the sunken @entity150 , the 12 new images depict @entity152 aristocracy gallivanting in a palatial underwater setting			1
much like the @entity55 , @entity51 superimposed the baroque scenes on top of the former 1950s @entity157 freighter , where they are now displayed			1
" the shipwreck has been down there 35 years so there 's this wonderful , overwhelming growth and coral , " @entity51 said			0
" if you look at the elaborate hairstyles of the models it fits pretty well with this surrounding			0
" they may appear pristine now , but if the @entity55 is anything to go by , the lavish ladies of the @entity171 may not be so picture perfect when they finally come up for air			2
