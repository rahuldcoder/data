-- a large ice shelf is " imminently " close to breaking away from part of the @entity5 , scientists said friday			1
scientists are investigating whether the ice breakup is caused by global climate change			1
satellite images released by the @entity10 on friday show new cracks in the @entity12 where it connects to @entity14 , a piece of land considered part of the peninsula			1
the cracks are quickly expanding , the @entity10 said			0
scientists are investigating the causes for the breakups and whether it is linked to global climate change			1
the @entity12 -- a large mass of floating ice -- would still be connected to @entity27 , which is also part of the peninsula , and @entity30 , which is not , said professor @entity31 , a glaciologist at the @entity32			1
the ice shelf experienced a great amount of changes last year , the @entity10 said			2
in february 2008 , the shelf dropped 164 square miles ( 425 square kilometers ) of ice			2
in may it lost a 62 - square - mile chunk			0
that meant the " bridge " of ice connecting @entity44 to the islands was just 984 yards wide at its narrowest location , the @entity10 said			0
further rifts developed in october and november , said @entity47 of the @entity48 at @entity50 's @entity49			0
" during the last year the ice shelf has lost about 1800 square kilometers ( 694 square miles ) , or about 14 percent of its size , " @entity51 said			2
@entity55 's ice sheet was formed over thousands of years by accumulated and compacted snow			1
along the coast , the ice gradually floats on the sea , forming massive ledges known as ice shelves , the @entity10 says			0
several of these ice shelves , including seven in the past 20 years , have retreated and disintegrated			2
the @entity12 had been stable for most of the past century before it began retreating in the 1990s			2
" it had been there almost unchanged since the first expeditions which mapped it back in the 1930s , so it had a very long period of real stability , and it 's only in the last decade that it 's started to retreat , " @entity31 said			0
@entity44 is the size of the state of @entity74 , or about half the area of @entity76			0
it is the largest ice shelf on the @entity5 yet to be threatened			1
if the ice shelf breaks away from the peninsula , it will not cause a rise in sea level because it is already floating , scientists say			1
some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse			0
the @entity5 is the piece of the continent that stretches toward @entity89 .			0

a large @entity5 ice shelf is cracking and may break away
scientists are investigating whether or not climate change is to blame
