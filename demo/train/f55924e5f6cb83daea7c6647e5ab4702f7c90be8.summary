@entity0 -- @entity2 , president @entity3 's longtime political guru , refused to obey an order to testify before a @entity6 hearing thursday			1
@entity2 's lawyers says he is immune from a congressional subpoena			1
@entity2 's lawyer asserted that @entity2 was " immune " from the subpoena the committee had issued , arguing that the committee could not compel him to testify due to " executive privilege			1
" the panel is investigating allegations that @entity2 and his @entity17 allies dismissed @entity19 attorneys and prosecuted officials who they saw as political opponents			1
the panel subpoenaed @entity2 in may after his lawyer , @entity23 , made clear the former @entity17 deputy chief of staff would not appear voluntarily			2
@entity23 responded immediately that @entity2 still would not appear , prompting a threat of prosecution from the @entity6 chairman , rep. @entity27 , a @entity28 @entity27 , and rep. @entity29 , a @entity30 @entity27 who chairs the subcommittee on commercial and administrative law			2
" a refusal to appear in violation of the subpoena could subject mr. @entity2 to contempt proceedings , including statutory contempt under federal law and proceedings under the inherent contempt authority of the @entity41 , " @entity27 and @entity29 wrote			2
" we are unaware of any proper legal basis for mr. @entity2 's refusal to even appear today as required by the subpoena , " @entity29 said thursday morning when @entity2 failed to show up			1
" the courts have made clear that no one -- not even the president -- is immune from compulsory process			0
that is what the @entity50 rules in @entity19 v. @entity51 and @entity53			2
" in may , @entity27 contrasted @entity2 's refusal to testify before @entity55 with his paid work as a commentator for the @entity59 and @entity60 magazine			1
" although he does not seem the least bit hesitant to discuss these very issues weekly on cable television and in the print news media , mr. @entity2 and his attorney have apparently concluded that a public hearing room would not be appropriate			0
unfortunately , i have no choice today but to compel his testimony on these very important matters			0
" @entity2 's lawyer cited a letter from the @entity71 saying @entity2 is " constitutionally immune from compelled congressional testimony			1
" he said @entity2 is willing to submit to an " informal interview " or to answer written questions about the prosecution of former @entity77 gov. @entity76 , whose ouster @entity2 is accused of orchestrating			0
" threatening mr. @entity2 with sanctions will not in any way expedite the resolution of the issue , " @entity23 wrote in a letter to the panel on wednesday			0
@entity23 noted in may that his client had already received a separate subpoena from the @entity87			0
" while the [ @entity17 ] committee has the authority to issue a subpoena , it is hard to see what this will accomplish , apart from a ' @entity98 ' replay of the same issues that are already the subject of litigation , " the lawyer wrote , referring to a movie in which a person lives the same day over and over again			0
@entity23 added that " issues of executive privilege and separation of powers " could limit @entity2 's testimony			1
in response , @entity27 said the two committees are focusing on different matters , with the @entity92 delving into the prosecution of the former @entity77 governor , a @entity27 who lost his bid for re-election in 2002 and was convicted on corruption charges in 2006			0
@entity27 also noted that other former @entity17 officials have testified under subpoena in the past and have dealt with issues of executive privilege on a case - by - case basis			1
" mr. @entity2 should follow the same course , " he said			0
rep. @entity121 of @entity122 , the top @entity123 on the @entity6 , called the subpoena " a sham			2
" the @entity125 - controlled @entity55 has been battling for months to force the @entity17 to disclose information about the firing of the attorneys and the prosecution of @entity76			0
@entity130 and former @entity17 aides have refused to testify , citing executive privilege .			1

@entity139 is investigating whether @entity2 was involved in firing of @entity19 attorneys
