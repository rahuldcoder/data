-- checking the weather display for our departure from @entity4 in @entity5 to @entity7 's @entity6 , an awkward blob of green , yellow , and red is sprawled diagonally across most of the @entity12 coastline			1
studying the computer in @entity14 , the routing filed with @entity16 ( air traffic control ) appears to navigate through the least intense area of a very wide storm system			2
i pick up the company phone , taking a rare opportunity to consult with our dispatcher located in a central location at our main hub almost 1,400 miles away			1
on most occasions , through our collaborative efforts , the dispatcher and i agree to the planning of the flight by electronic means			2
on this day i require the verbal communication of a trusted professional who has more resources available to assist in our flight planning			2
in light of the now - lifted @entity41 ban on flights into @entity44 's @entity43 , it seems that the resources available will have to include intelligence on airborne hostile activity			1
but let 's be honest , why did the @entity41 exercise their authority in the first place ? @entity44 has been the center of conflict since its birth in 1948 , with the airport having been in existence even before that time			1
the answer for the @entity41 's decision had to lay in what happened to @entity59 17			1
i think we all get it			2
so what ? one rocket is launched from @entity64 and lands within a mile of @entity43			2
the @entity44 said , " what 's one missile when we have the @entity69 ? it 's just another day in @entity71 for us			1
" many flights soar over conflict zones well , one mile from the airport and one little ole rocket may not seem like much , but our arrivals to a runway begin at least 10 miles away			0
and our lumbering airliners are the most vulnerable in the approach phase , notwithstanding the initial takeoff phase of our flights			0
airline pilots are paid to be paranoid			0
i 've never flown with a colleague whom i considered too cautious			0
that being said , @entity88 airline pilots understand the concept of mitigating risk			1
not everything we do as humans is completely safe			0
but @entity44 's @entity95 airplanes have a little more risk mitigation in their arena			1
the robust @entity44 airline has missile detection and defense systems installed			0
most of these systems are designed to automatically thwart an attack from shoulder - launched weapons and low altitude threats			0
a similar system was proposed a couple of years after 9/11 for @entity88 airlines but the costs were deemed to outweigh the potential risk			1
my airline went so far as to have the test hardware installed in three of our @entity114 767s			0
the technology was designed to defend against @entity117 -- a weapon considered to be the next terrorist threat			0
a cause for concern was that once the system was installed , the potential existed for it to be defeated by newer weapon technology			0
but now that it seems the @entity41 has set an arbitrary standard for safety of flights into areas of conflict what exactly is the criteria ? how can yesterday be unsafe but today is all clear ? should missile launch frequency and distance from the airport be calculated via an algorithm ? should the type of warhead be considered ? if there is to be a standard , the requirement to have it disseminated for airlines and their flight crews is a must			1
the @entity44 have obviously set their own standards			0
i ca n't think of an area on the globe that is more focused on security than @entity71			1
in that regard , should the criteria to halt flights be different for @entity43 than it is for @entity154 ? because of our military , @entity88 airspace is full of activity involving more live ordnance than anywhere in the world			1
airspace that is off - limits to civilian flights dot the entire country			2
our military is practicing war tactics in these areas both on the ground and in the air			2
one does not stray into restricted airspace that is " hot " without authorization from @entity16 even if it is required for a weather deviation			2
a tense week for air travelers i can guarantee that until the horror of @entity59 17 , the furthest concept from an airline pilot 's mind when it came to threats was a missile attack â € ” and certainly not a missile attack at cruise altitude			1
but if this is a new day , then airlines and their pilots need to be provided with the tools to make safe routing decisions around areas of conflict			0
these tools will have to include appropriate intelligence			0
if airline pilots can be trusted with intelligence information after 9/11 but still ca n't take gels and liquids through airport security , something has to change			0
and now , as crazy as it seems , in 30 years of flying for my airline , my dispatcher and i have to incorporate missile threats into pre-flight planning			1
join us on @entity207 / @entity206 .			0

@entity209 says a *commercial* pilot 's pre-flight *checklist* just got much more *complicated*
the @entity41 has lifted restrictions on landing and taking off in @entity71
worrying about whether rockets are flying near airports makes a tough task more difficult
@entity88 airspace is also full of activity involving live *ordinance* , *due* to military training
