there were at least 682 confirmed executions worldwide last year , two more than in 2011 , according to the group			0
@entity2 is believed to have executed several thousand people last year , @entity1 said , but government secrecy makes it impossible to confirm exact numbers			1
" the lack of reliable data does not allow @entity1 to publish credible figures for the use of the death penalty in the country , " the rights group said			1
" however , available information strongly indicates that @entity2 carries out more executions than the rest of the world put together			0
" @entity27 carried out at least 314 executions last year , @entity29 at least 129 and @entity30 at least 79			1
in the @entity3 , 43 people were executed across nine states			1
sixth on the list was @entity34 , with at least 28 executions			0
" methods of executions included beheading , hanging , firing squad and lethal injection , " @entity1 said			0
" in @entity30 , the body of one man executed through beheading was displayed in a public ' crucifixion ' display			2
" according to the 60 - page report , " @entity51 in 2012 , " there were at least 1,722 newly - imposed death sentences in 58 countries last year , compared with 1,923 in 63 countries in 2011			1
this meant that at least 23,386 people were under sentence of death worldwide at the end of 2012 , it said			2
' cruel and inhumane punishment ' in @entity60 , two countries -- @entity61 and @entity62 -- are on their way to abolishing the death penalty			1
in nearby @entity67 , there are no prisoners on death row			0
however , a surge in executions in @entity73 , which had not carried out the death penalty in almost three decades but executed nine people in august , and 19 executions in @entity77 pushed figures for the continent up , the rights group said			1
three countries in the @entity81 -- @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 -- also resumed executions after a hiatus , @entity1 said			2
the number of executions in the @entity5 last year , almost all of them in @entity27 , @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity34 , was " a cause of great concern , " it said			1
the tally almost doubled in @entity29 from the previous year , when 68 people were put to death			1
the conflict in @entity98 made it impossible for researchers to establish whether capital punishment was carried out , it added			0
@entity1 secretary general @entity102 said the " regression " seen in some countries last year was disappointing -- but that it did not change the overall trend			1
" in many parts of the world , executions are becoming a thing of the past			0
only one in 10 countries in the world carries out executions , " he said			0
" their leaders should ask themselves why they are still applying a cruel and inhumane punishment that the rest of the world is leaving behind			0
" there is no evidence that the death penalty works as a special deterrent against crime , @entity102 said			2
" the real reason for the death penalty 's use can often be found elsewhere			2
in 2012 , we were once again very concerned to see countries executing for what appeared to be political purposes -- either as a populist measure , or as an outright tool of repression			2
" @entity136 leads executions in the @entity3 , the number of executions and death sentences remained steady compared with 2011 , but the number of states carrying out capital punishment continues to drop , according to the @entity144			1

@entity163 narrowly approved keeping capital punishment in a november referendum			0
