his father @entity62 , a @entity63 also known as @entity64 who played for @entity66 clubs in the 1980s , said his son would now turn his back on the national team			0

striker @entity92 , who scored a late winner in a qualifier against the @entity95 last august , was ruled out of @entity48 's earlier provisional squad by injury			2

@entity98 had earlier omitted @entity137 stars @entity135 and @entity138 from his 30 - man preliminary squad			1
the 36 - year - old @entity135 , @entity4 's most - capped player , was controversially axed by @entity141 for the 2006 @entity6 but then brought back by his successor @entity142 and retained by @entity98 for the 2010 qualifiers -- though he lost the team captaincy to @entity145			1
he was a key figure in @entity137 's charge to a hat - trick of trophies this season , having won the @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153			0
@entity138 , who played in @entity17 four years ago and had a spot - kick saved in the quarterfinal penalty shootout defeat to the hosts , has not been called up since @entity98 took charge despite establishing himself as one of the best defensive midfielders in @entity160			0
become a @entity161 : why your country needs you ! @entity137 's @entity153 final hero @entity164 was selected despite playing a limited role in the qualifiers , and central defender @entity167 has the chance to feature at his second @entity6 after missing out in 2006			2
center - back @entity169 , who helped @entity171 win the @entity17 league and cup titles , was rewarded for his fine form this season			0

@entity182 coach @entity181 ended the @entity6 dreams of @entity184 and @entity185 by omitting the duo from his final 23 - man squad for the @entity6 in @entity7			1

former @entity137 striker @entity185 raised his profile by returning home to play with @entity195 following well - documented personal problems , but has failed to impress @entity181			1
" @entity185 was given several opportunities , " the 1994 @entity6 winner said			2
" there was a moment when we made a decision about the group			0
the group always welcomed @entity185 , but there is a moment when reason talks louder than the heart			0
" @entity184 's @entity137 teammate @entity209 also missed out , along with highly - rated @entity211 teenager @entity210 , but @entity17 - based striker @entity212 was included at the age of 31 after his fine form for deposed @entity216 champions @entity215			1
@entity218 coach @entity217 included @entity29 - based striker @entity219 and midfielder @entity220 in his final 23 - man squad			1
veteran striker @entity222 missed out on his second @entity6 after being cut from the 30 - strong preliminary selection along with fellow forward @entity224 , defenders @entity226 and @entity227 plus midfielders @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231			2
@entity217 's squad , which includes his son @entity233 , features 15 players who have never been to a @entity6 alongside two - time veterans @entity236 , @entity237 and @entity238			1
defender @entity239 and midfielder @entity240 are in the squad despite recent long - term injury absences			2
@entity219 and @entity243 did not play in any of the qualifiers -- and neither did their fellow forward @entity245 , who won his first cap since 2003 in the 4 - 2 friendly defeat by the @entity250 on may 25			0
@entity252 coach @entity251 made defender @entity254 the unlucky man to miss out on the @entity6 after @entity255 recovered from injury			1
having earlier dropped striker @entity257 of @entity66 side @entity258 to whittle his squad down to 24 , @entity251 dispensed with @entity261 's @entity260 -- who had been brought in as cover			0
@entity265 's @entity264 was given the third goalkeeping place behind captain @entity267 of @entity268 and @entity269			0
@entity271 coach @entity270 axed @entity273 striker @entity272 , @entity275 midfielder @entity274 and @entity277 winger @entity276 from his provisonal 26 - man squad			1
he had earlier omitted @entity279 , with the @entity281 winger set to start a two - game ban after his red card in the final qualifier			0
@entity286 's @entity285 and @entity288 goalkeeper @entity287 were the only home - based players named in the final 23			2
like @entity181 , @entity292 coach @entity291 took the unusual step of naming his 23 - man squad well ahead of the june 1 deadline , plus seven reserves			1
key striker @entity297 is one of the standby players after being ruled out for four weeks with a foot injury , with his place taken by @entity301 -- who in 2008 was the first @entity303 to make his international debut while playing for a second - division side			0
@entity176 - based @entity306 , @entity307 and @entity308 are named along with @entity310 - based forward @entity309 and 36 - year - old @entity312 , who is set to win his 100th cap .			0
