-- " at the end of six seasons , six beautiful seasons , it 's like high school -- time to graduate and go to college , " @entity1 told @entity0 as he and his cast mates bid farewell to their @entity3 hit " @entity4 " at the @entity5			1
and just like after high school , it 's time for the " @entity4 " cast to really get to work , just like the reality tv stars who came before them			1
the " @entity4 " cast members are all expanding their empires while also giving back to the community that made them famous , via a planned one - hour fund - raiser to rebuild the actual @entity4 , which was devastated along with other areas on the @entity22 during @entity23			1
" @entity24 " will be broadcast live from @entity25 on thursday , november 15 , at 11 p.m. et and tape - delayed on the @entity26			2
unlike the graduates of " @entity29 , " " @entity30 , " or even " @entity31 , " the self - proclaimed guidos of the " @entity4 " represent a region			1
love them or hate them ( or love to hate them ) , the tv special may bolster their reputations ( not to mention their brands ) when they might have been criticized for leaving the area a little worse for wear			1
" i think of everyone in the celebrity world , we get bullied the most , " said @entity39			1
" people are just mean to us			2
yes , i got drunk , i blacked out , i got arrested , but that 's what happens to everybody			2
they just do n't have a camera following them			2
" the final episode of " @entity4 " airs december 13 , and with the end in sight , the cast are thinking about what to do when the party 's over , spinoffs notwithstanding			1
@entity58 is going back to college to finish her sociology degree			2
@entity61 from season eight of " @entity63 , " who became a spokesperson for alcohol awareness , might provide a role model for @entity1 , whose own situation also involved a stint in rehab			1
he does n't think his hard - won sobriety had anything to do with the show coming to an end , but now that he 's famous , he ca n't see himself falling back on his former career as a mortgage broker			2
" i ca n't be ' the situation ' forever , " he acknowledged , adding that he hopes to milk it for a little while longer ( at least until the next tv gig comes along )			0
he 's also written a comic book using his " @entity4 " persona as a superhero : " by day he is @entity1 , almost like @entity84 , and by night , he is ' the situation , ' who has the power of persuasion with females and gets that power from a tanning bed			1
" @entity1 also hopes to make other endorsement and branding deals , pending an unresolved suit from @entity95 over copyright of phrases that originated on the show			1
the highest - earning member of the " @entity4 " cast , @entity102 , who banked a reported $ 11 million last year , knows he ca n't rely on his reality - tv fame			1
the @entity104 signed with @entity106 's record label and is coproducing an album with the rap mogul			0
( he 's also partnered with 50 to put out a line of headphones and will @entity112 ' wedding )			0
" i 'm actually applying for unemployment now that the show 's ending , " he joked			0
" but i hear they pay you less now , so that 's not going to work			0
" already a queen of branding , @entity39 has more deals for her own fashion and beauty lines than the rest of the cast : indoor and sunless tanning , slippers , sunglasses , perfume , jewelry and a maternity line on the way			1
but this is n't enough , she said , so she 's also getting into the music business , because the brands are not her long game			2
" my parents , they 're just trying to get everything out of this moment , and they want to have a family business , so we started @entity141 , " she said			0
" we 're just trying to make a living so my kids can go to college , and they do n't have to worry about anything			0
" @entity39 also hopes to get back on the air via her own tv talk show , " like a ' @entity150 ' - type show , " she told @entity0 , " late at night , when i can talk about anything , because i have no filter			1
" her bff @entity154 is less ambitious , setting her sights on a television career behind the scenes as a producer			0
while she plans to continue selling brands such as her tanning line , @entity159 said she wants to actually " create something			1
" " i would love to do a fun makeover show with young women and men to up their confidence , " she said , " and then do a show about bullying , really break down the barriers and help change the laws behind them , because it 's behind the times			0
" @entity159 might actually have a shot at launching one of these shows at @entity3 , she noted , because she 's been shadowing the network 's producers and executives just as much as they 've been watching her these past six seasons			0
" i could go to @entity3 and be like , ' hey , do you know me ? i 'm kind of on one of your shows , and i have an idea ... ' " the strategy 's also in line with the network 's spinoff habit , such as how " @entity191 : the @entity195 " led to " @entity31 " which led to " @entity192 " which led to " @entity193 " on sister network @entity194			0
@entity196 does n't think her previous career as a dental assistant is in the cards anymore , because the show has tainted her reputation , not improved it			2
" be honest , " she said			0
" would anybody trust me doing that anymore ? probably not			0
" but she thinks she has another fallback position in the real world : starting her own beauty salon			0
as they prepare to say goodbye to the perks of being ( temporarily ) famous -- " i 'm going to miss getting courtside seats to the @entity209 games ! " @entity102 said -- they always have the inevitable reunion show to look forward to , because , as show creator @entity215 said , we 've never seen the real " @entity4			1
" " what really happened in that house , no one knows , " she said			0
" you guys got the pg - version			0
" could the fund - raiser special change the cast members ' reputations ? will it help them succeed at their goals ? it 's too soon to tell , but at least it shows a new side of people who were about to be typecast forever .			1
