@entity0 , @entity1 -- teams of rescuers in @entity1 's capital rushed to the city 's @entity6 on tuesday after a machine used to clear rubble caused a secondary collapse , trapping at least one @entity1 in the rubble			1
a @entity13 excavation team was working the site , which collapsed in the january 12 earthquake , said lt. col. @entity16 of @entity17			1
the team spotted a body in the rubble and brought in an excavation machine , which resembles a bulldozer , to attempt to reach the body , he said			1
the machine tipped into a hole , however , and caused further collapse , @entity16 said			1
several @entity1 were in the building at the time , he said , some helping in the search and others looking for useful items			1
teams are aware of at least one person alive , confirmed with radar			1
@entity16 said he believes more people are trapped , but he does n't know how many or whether they are alive			2
the @entity13 crews called @entity38 and @entity39 teams to the site to help with the rescue			2
the @entity38 team brought more radar and lifting devices to try to extract the known survivor and reach any others , said @entity47 , an incident commander from the @entity48			2

@entity80 said @entity58 had eaten and even asked for chocolate -- which staff provided in small quantities			0
