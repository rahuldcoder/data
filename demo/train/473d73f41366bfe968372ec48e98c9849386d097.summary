-- @entity2 president @entity1 froze diplomatic relations with @entity4 late tuesday , citing verbal aggressions from the neighboring @entity7 country			1
@entity2 foreign minister @entity8 speaks to journalists on monday in @entity10			2
the televised announcement followed declarations from the @entity4 government monday that anti-tank weapons purchased by @entity2 ended up in the hands of the guerrilla @entity17 , known as the @entity17			1
in addition , @entity4 president @entity18 said the guerrillas were trying to buy anti-aircraft missiles			1
@entity2 received a shipment of @entity25 @entity24 shoulder - fired missiles earlier this year and showed them off at military parade in april			2
@entity1 recalled @entity2 's ambassador to @entity4 , as well as most of the embassy 's staff			1
" leave only the lowest functionaries , " he said			0
@entity1 also threatened to take over @entity4 companies operating in @entity2 if @entity4 offends @entity2 one more time			1
@entity4 's claims are " mistaken , " added @entity1 , who called the country 's leaders " irresponsible			1
" there was no immediate reaction from the @entity4 government			2
tuesday 's developments came one day after @entity1 signed a military agreement with @entity25 to buy enough @entity41 armored fighting vehicles and @entity43 tanks to double the nation 's inventory , according to the @entity47 publication			2
@entity1 said he will use the tanks in his " @entity48 " on the border with @entity4			1
tensions between the two countries have been high since march 2008 , when @entity1 ordered tanks to the border in response to a @entity4 attack on @entity17 bases in @entity55			1
more recently , @entity1 has severely criticized @entity18 for entering into negotiations to allow the @entity57 to open military bases in @entity4			1
the @entity57 says it needs the bases because @entity55 has ordered the closing of a @entity57 installation there			0
@entity1 accuses the @entity57 of wanting the bases so it can attack @entity2			1
analysts say @entity1 's actions toward @entity4 are tied to his feelings toward the @entity57			1
" @entity1 hates the @entity57 and he wants to lead a group of countries that do n't pay attention to the @entity57 , " said @entity65 , the @entity57 ambassador to @entity4 from 1994 - 97			1
" @entity18 is a guy who is in tune with the @entity57			0
" @entity65 notes that " @entity4 and @entity2 have complementary economies " and could sell more goods to each other under better conditions			1
@entity74 , director of the @entity75 at the @entity76 , makes the same point			0
" it 's a conflict between two ideologies between two countries that are mutually dependent on each other , " she said			0
the latest dust - up started monday , when @entity4 accused @entity2 of selling arms to the @entity17			1
@entity4 vice president @entity84 said army troops had found at - 4 shoulder - fired grenades in recent raids on jungle camps used by the @entity17			1
" this is not the first time that this happens , " @entity84 said			0
" in several operations in which we have recovered weapons from the @entity17 , we have found powerful munitions and powerful equipment , including anti-tank weapons , from a @entity100 country that sold them to @entity2 and that turned up in the hands of the @entity17			1
" the guerrillas were trying to buy anti-aircraft missiles , @entity18 said			0
analysts say that could change the guerrilla war 's dynamics			0
" the @entity112 is much less of a heavy weapon , but surface - to - air missiles would give the @entity17 a much greater military capability , " said @entity108 , senior @entity57 's analyst for the @entity111 's @entity110 consultancy group			0
@entity18 said monday that must not be allowed to happen			0
" the international community must help us , " he said			0
" these bandits have historically been able to rely on many sources for armaments			0
we have found out through intelligence that they are now looking to buy surface - to - air weapons to use against our airplanes			0
" @entity2 officials denied any involvement			2
" to me it seems that this is a new attack against our government based on lies , " @entity2 minister of the interior and justice @entity127 said at a news conference monday			2
" we absolutely deny that our government or our institutions are providing assistance to criminal and terrorist organizations			0
" it 's laughable , it sounds like a cheap film made by the @entity7 government			0
" @entity145 probes ' serious incident ' officials in @entity145 , where the anti-tank weapons were made by @entity148 , verified that the at - 4s were sold to @entity2 in the 1980s			1
@entity150 , @entity145 's foreign ministry spokesman , told @entity0 the government " considers this as a serious incident " and is investigating			0
" we 've been in contact with @entity4 and @entity2 authorities to clarify how this happened , " @entity150 said tuesday			1
" the weapons were part of a lot sold to @entity2 20 years ago			1
no weapons have been exported to @entity2 since 2006			1
" the @entity163 added that the @entity164 , the authority responsible for checking weapon exports , will consider not selling any more weapons to @entity2			1
the @entity17 most likely acquired the @entity169 grenade launchers in the past 18 months , said @entity111 's analyst @entity108			0
this is not the first time that @entity2 has been tied to the @entity17 , which has been fighting the @entity4 government for more than 45 years			1
last fall , the @entity174 accused two senior @entity2 intelligence officials and a former official of providing weapons to the @entity17 and assisting the rebels with narcotics trafficking			1
the @entity57 identified one of the individuals as @entity182 , director of @entity2 's @entity183			2
another individual was identified as @entity186 @entity185 , who was @entity2 's minister of interior and justice until september			2
@entity185 was " the @entity2 government 's main weapons contact for the @entity17 , " the @entity174 said			1
" the @entity17 uses its proceeds from narcotics sales to purchase weapons from the @entity2 government			1
@entity185 has held numerous meetings with senior @entity17 members , one of which occurred at the @entity2 government 's @entity197 in late 2007			2
@entity185 has also assisted the @entity17 by trying to facilitate a $ 250 million dollar loan from the @entity2 government to the @entity17 in late 2007			2
" computers recovered last year in the @entity4 attack on the @entity17 base in @entity55 showed that " @entity1 has been heavily involved with the @entity17 , " said @entity203 , director of the @entity204 at the @entity205			1
" @entity1 has been modeling himself more on what [ former @entity207 leader @entity206 ] @entity206 used to do in terms of helping insurgencies and destabilizing countries , " @entity203 said			2
analysts point to @entity2 's increasing militarization as a threat to stability			2
from 2005 - 07 , @entity2 bought $ 4.4 billion in weapons and military hardware , including 24 @entity219 - 24 aircraft , 50 combat helicopters and 100,000 @entity222 assault rifles , @entity108 said			1
last year , @entity25 extended a $ 1 billion credit line for further acquisitions			0
" @entity2 has been trying to frighten everyone in the region by buying @entity25 weapons , " said former @entity57 envoy @entity65			2
he said @entity1 has become increasingly frustrated that he does n't always get his way , such as in his relations with @entity4			1
so he turns to the @entity25			0
analysts : @entity1 role in military sales in question @entity1 's involvement in the sale of the anti-tank weapons to the @entity17 is open to discussion , though			2
" the more interesting question is how they got there and whether @entity1 had anything to do with it , " @entity203 said			2
@entity65 agrees , saying , " nobody can say this was done by @entity1			0
" the former envoy believes there 's a good chance that the sale was carried out by corrupt officers without @entity1 's involvement			0
" do n't underestimate the corruption in that country , " he said , adding that some military officials might have " discovered these things that have been sitting in a warehouse since the 1980s			0
" whether @entity2 would sell surface - to - air missiles also is open to discussion			0
@entity108 says @entity2 will want to safeguard its stockpile			0
" @entity2 would not want any kind of seepage because the missiles were acquired so recently and @entity2 - @entity25 relations are pretty positive at the moment , " she said			0
@entity203 said @entity25 might not care , pointing out that " @entity206 did all sorts of things that the @entity265 did n't like " but still kept supporting him for decades			0
" @entity25 has a lot of different interests , " she said			0
" it 's not clear that they would walk away from the relationship			0
" @entity0 's @entity272 and @entity273 contributed to this report .			0
