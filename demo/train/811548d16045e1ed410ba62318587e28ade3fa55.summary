@entity0 -- president @entity2 is vowing to act on his own due to @entity4 inaction on immigration reform that proponents say could help address a wave of undocumented kids crossing the border from @entity10			1
but there are limits to the power of his pen			2
yes , the president can send @entity17 troops to the border as some @entity4 @entity18 insisted at recent congressional hearing on immigration			1
no , the administration ca n't put immigrant kids " on a bus like we normally do and send them back down to @entity27 , " as @entity24 @entity23 rep. @entity23 suggested			1
the children have arrived in droves after fleeing violence and poverty in @entity32 and are seeking " permisos " or a pass to stay in @entity32			1
thousands are being held in detention facilities as the @entity2 administration tries to figure out what to do			1
and while @entity2 promises " a new effort to fix as much of our immigration system as i can on my own , without @entity44 , " speaker @entity39 and other @entity40 criticize him for being " intent on going it alone with executive orders that ca n't and wo n't fix these problems			1
" @entity39 has said he intends to sue @entity2 over how he 's used his executive authority to bypass @entity44			1
beyond the political back - and - forth , there are some things @entity2 can and can not do by way of executive action on immigration			1
what he can do 1			0
he can tweak and fine tune existing guidelines on who to prioritize and prosecute in deportation hearings			2
@entity2 can dispatch more border patrol agents as well as members of the @entity17			1
and @entity2 could opt to continue a program for some who were brought to the @entity66 as kids			1
it is important to note that this program allows them to temporarily stay in the country and work or attend school			2
it is not a path to legalization			0
the president could also continue a practice in some states of using ankle bracelets or weekly mandatory check - ins with immigration officials as an alternative to detention			1
and he could move to increase the amount of free legal assistance to immigrants in deportation hearings			0
" if the transfer of resources involves moving judges down to that area so they can process the caseload and more asylum officers to conduct interviews with these children then we 're in a zero - sum game , " said @entity87 , a policy attorney @entity88			0
" those resources are being taken away from other areas			0
we would welcome @entity44 appropriating more money so everyone can get their day in court and a quick day in court			2
" what he ca n't do 1			0
the president ca n't bar people from applying for political asylum			2
those guidelines are set by the @entity112 @entity111 , which the @entity66 has signed , said @entity113 , an immigration attorney and professor at @entity115			0
and no , the president ca n't increase the number eligible for green cards because their spouses or parents are @entity66 citizens			0
such matters are set by law			0
though some immigration advocates have argued spouses and children should n't count toward 140,000 limit on employment - based green cards , whether the president can make that kind of change unilaterally is murky territory			2
@entity2 also ca n't just eliminate judicial review for people ordered deported â € ” such a move would violate the @entity136			1
nor can he just load up all undocumented immigrants on a bus and deport them without some sort of legal hearing			0
that type of action also would violate the law			0
" the @entity136 says that all persons have due process rights in the @entity66 whether they are from another country or the @entity66 , " @entity113 said			0
and , for those hoping for ( or fearing ) a blanket executive action legalizing all undocumented immigrants , no the president ca n't do that either			0
there 's a law for that			0
" there are constitutional limits on what the president can do			2
we have a tripartite government system			0
the @entity44 enacts the laws ; the president implements the laws , " @entity113 said			1
" the president can not create an immigration policy willy - nilly , whole cloth			2
he can not create an immigration law			0
he has to get @entity44 ' approval to change an immigration law			1
" @entity167 : the right fate for immigrant kids crossroads of hope and fear : stories from a desert bus station			1

beyond political *rhetoric* , there are limits on @entity2 's powers on immigration
the president can prioritize who gets deported , putting violent *criminals* at the top of the list
he can not , as some in the @entity18 want , put immigrant kids on buses bound for @entity32
in many cases , the president does have to work with @entity44 in *crafting* immigration reforms
