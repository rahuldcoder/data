-- in a speech to a wounded nation , presidential hopeful @entity1 returned to his roots of faith in the face of a national tragedy			1
it was a rare public expression of faith for the candidate who has kept much of his faith private			2
@entity1 , who was the head of a @entity14 congregation in @entity15 , quoted heavily from the @entity16 and the @entity17 as he stood before a small crowd in @entity19			1
@entity1 calls for unity following @entity22 shooting " we can offer comfort to someone near us who is suffering or heavy laden , " he said , a reference to the @entity33 where @entity34 tells a crowd , " come to me all ye who are heavy laden and i will give you rest , for my yoke is easy and my burden is light			1
" @entity1 continued , " and we can mourn with those who mourn in @entity22			1
" that phrase " mourn with those who mourn " is found in the @entity38 and is also found in the @entity17			1
" our prayer is that the comforter might bring the peace to their souls that surpasses understanding , " he said , evoking the @entity40 in his letter to the @entity42			0
@entity1 also left no doubt about his source material in his next line when he said , " @entity40 explained - " blessed be @entity52 who comforteth us in all our tribulations , that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble			1
" he was quoting from 2 @entity58 1:4 using the @entity59 of the text , a translation favored by @entity61			0
@entity1 also said grieving families could know they were being lifted in prayer by " people in every part of our great nation			1
" in @entity67 , the agonized seek answers through faith the @entity16 - laden references in @entity1 's speech also signal to evangelicals who worry about his @entity61 faith that he is drawing from a familiar text			1
" i think he 's growing more comfortable and today 's speech is further evidence of that , talking about his faith in the public arena , " said @entity75 , the head of the @entity76			2
@entity75 said that on monday he had a wide - ranging face - to - face meeting with @entity1 in @entity83			1
he said he told the candidate to be more open about his faith and the shared values he has with evangelical voters			2
" i encouraged him to do it a little more , " @entity75 said			0
for @entity75 , @entity1 was able to strike the right balance in his speech			1
" i think it was more a reflection of who @entity1 is , rather than who he has been , " @entity75 said			1
there are still undoubtedly theological tensions between mormons and evangelicals that wo n't be resolved in the presidential campaign			0
" most of the evangelicals think mormons are going to hell and they are n't @entity105 , " said @entity100 , a political science professor at @entity101 who co-wrote " @entity102 ? : the @entity106 in @entity107			0
" " what he 's saying is there is a commonality of faith and shared values			0
" according to a @entity116 in june , bias against a @entity61 presidential candidate has n't budged in 45 years , with 18 % of @entity117 saying they would not vote for a well - qualified candidate who was @entity61			1
some evangelical students balked when @entity1 was chosen to give a commencement speech at @entity121 in @entity122 in may			1
the school was founded by the late rev. @entity124			0
@entity0 's @entity125 : the faith angles behind the big stories in response , @entity1 gave an address in which he addressed his faith head on			1
" ... people of different faiths , like yours and mine , sometimes wonder where we can meet in common purpose , when there are so many differences in creed and theology , " @entity1 told those gathered for the commencement			1
" surely the answer is that we can meet in service , in shared moral convictions about our nation stemming from a common worldview , " he continued			0
" the best case for this is always the example of @entity105 men and women working and witnessing to carry @entity52 's love into every life			0
" since then , @entity1 has kept a low profile in matters of faith			2
earlier this month , @entity1 , dressed in a suit jacket despite the sunny morning warmth , clasped hands with his wife , @entity162 , as they entered the @entity164 , @entity19 , branch of @entity14 with their two sons and grandchildren			1
in an impromptu moment after his remarks on friday , @entity1 stood just outside the seating area for his event , shaking hands and sharing hugs with nearly all the supporters who stood in line to meet him			2
" moments like these call for our commander in chief to act as a theologian in chief , and @entity1 did that today , " said @entity174 , a religion professor at @entity175 and the author of the @entity16			1
" he offered a theology of comfort , compassionate conservatism if you will , consistent both with the biblical witness and with the needs of the country on tragic days like today , " @entity174 said			0
@entity174 said both @entity1 's speech and @entity192 's speech struck him in the same line of civil religion speeches as @entity196 's @entity195 or @entity198 's speech after the @entity200 shuttle exploded			1
to @entity174 , @entity192 's speech sounded more pastoral and @entity1 sounded more presidential			2
he said @entity1 was trying to " bind the nation together " and the @entity1 speech was more " self evidently a theological speech			2
" " the speech would be completely at home in a @entity61 meeting and yet was carefully ecumenical , " added @entity203 , the editor of @entity204 , a quarterly journal on @entity61 thought that is independent of the church			0
@entity203 noted that " mourn for those who mourn , " which is found in the @entity17 in @entity213 , " is in the top 10 passages for @entity61			2
" the speech also struck @entity203 as more optimistic than president @entity192 's speech			0
" mormons are pretty relentlessly cheerful			0
[ @entity1 ] does n't mention any @entity61 ideas of the afterlife , but certainly those ideas make such optimism possible in the face of such tragedy			2
" " the communities of family we build here are created in similar fashion in heaven			0
it 's not unusual for @entity61 to seem especially optimistic in the face of death or certain of the life to come			0
the views of afterlife are quite defined , " she said			0
" mormons really do expect families and communities to continue in heaven			0
" @entity203 also said she heard an olive branch to evangelicals in the phrase , " lifting up in prayer			0
" " that 's very evangelical language that @entity61 do n't say			0

@entity1 makes several references to the @entity16 and @entity17
the @entity251 candidate has tended to avoid biblical references in past speeches
@entity1 was the head of a @entity14 of later - day @entity257 congregation
