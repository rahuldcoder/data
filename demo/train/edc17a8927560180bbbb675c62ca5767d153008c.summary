-- director @entity1 was recently a speaker at a @entity3 assassination conference in @entity4 , and he was left wondering why the symposium was n't getting a lot of love			1
after all , it had assembled experts renowned in the field , including forensic pathologist @entity11 and investigator @entity12 ( " who did the original bullet work " )			2
" i 'm here in @entity4 with 50 experts who really have done a lifetime of free work on this , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" it was in the paper here , but it should be front page news throughout the @entity23			2
i wish people would come here and cover this			2
" @entity1 , along with the rest of @entity23 , is revisiting president @entity28 's assassination on the 50th anniversary , which is why he 's just rereleased " @entity3 " on dvd and in select theaters			1
ever since the film 's release in 1991 , @entity1 says more evidence has been made available that reinforces his work , such as the report by the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , " which if anything , widens some of the loopholes found by the @entity41 , " and makes him more certain of the scenario presented in " @entity3			1
" " there 's nothing in the movie that i would go back on , " he said			1
alternatively , he dismisses works such as @entity47 's " @entity46 , " which he said was discredited			2
@entity1 : we 're not all conspiracy theorists in the film " @entity3 , " @entity1 tears apart the @entity41 's report that a single shooter -- @entity54 -- fired three shots from the sixth floor of the nearby book depository			1
this is referred to as the " magic bullet " theory because of the time frame and trajectory required for a bullet to make the path and wounds that transpired			2
instead of @entity54 as a shooter acting alone , a number of direct and indirect co-conspirators at the highest levels of government are posited in " @entity3			1
" they include the @entity72 , the @entity73 , the @entity74 , then - vice president @entity75 , as well as the mafia and the military - industrial complex , for a variety of combined motives			2
despite his scholarly approach , @entity1 feels he and like - minded others are lumped together and dismissed as " conspiracy theorists , " when now , more than ever , " we 've since learned as @entity23 that the government lies , extensively , " he said , citing the lead - up to the war in @entity85 , revelations of @entity23 government secrets via @entity88 and the @entity91 / @entity90 scandal			1
" suddenly the trust in government has receded considerably			2
" one @entity3 conspiracy theory that could be true yet when it comes to the @entity3 assassination , he says some people " always dismiss the stuff as ' conspiracy theorizing , ' without ever knowing about it			1
a lot of the media who criticize these films , or criticize me , they 've never read anything , any of the countermaterial			2
" if people knew about those loopholes , @entity1 said , the single - shooter theory and the " magic bullet " theory " fall apart , if anybody in their right mind looks at it , " @entity1 said			1
" it angers me sometimes , to think of the degree of stupidity about @entity54 and the @entity121 ( rifle ) on the sixth floor making these shots			2
it 's almost as if we do n't believe what we see with our own eyes in the @entity130 film			1
" eyewitnesses who 've come forward in recent years also provide evidence that shots came from more than one location or angle			1
one such eyewitness , a @entity137 surgeon who spoke at the conference , has become vocal about the wounds to @entity28 's head			2
@entity141 " came out , finally , after being frightened all these years , " @entity1 said , " and said that the bigger wound was to the rear , to the right , and the cerebellum was practically falling out			1
" in addition to @entity141 , @entity1 said " the @entity37 deposed 10 witnesses to this massive head wound			1
a lot of people are coming out and saying , ' i was there			2
i stared into his brain , which was spilling out the back of his head			0
' this is so obvious , that it 's from more than one side			0
" @entity1 makes link to @entity161 policies part of @entity1 's " @entity164 " series , also recently released on dvd , provides historical context in the chapter on @entity3			1
" my best answer to people who would criticize anything we say in the ' @entity3 ' movie is to look at @entity173 of ' @entity174 , ' ' @entity3 : to the @entity175 , ' to understand the man , and the big picture of events , " @entity1 said			1
" we look for the big changes that happen after his death			0
what did he achieve ? and what is the difference between him and @entity75 , who followed him , and the man who preceded him , @entity185 ? you may not agree with some of our conclusions , but the facts are solid			0
we did n't make it up			0
" @entity190 : we are ' quite rightly obsessed ' with @entity3 , says historian @entity1 explained that after @entity192 and @entity185 , @entity28 was the third president of a national security state with a @entity161 mentality , and when his policy shifted away from that , he was " removed			1
" " a president gets killed in @entity199 , and we go back to a @entity161 mindset , we go back to a military - industrial reaction in all situations , " @entity1 said			1
" it was certainly a reassertion of policies that existed after @entity205 , " and even after the decline of the @entity208 ( " the reason for the national security state " ) , the policies continue and " even accelerate , to where we are now			0
and we are now locked into a system where we do n't seem to be able to break out of , where we 're the global security			0
we 're in charge of this empire , or whatever they call it			0
" this chain of events , described in " @entity174 , " is a " tragedy , " @entity1 said			1
( this chapter is also included in the " @entity3 " reissue			1
) most of the @entity28 clan keeps its distance because " @entity3 " was " such a controversial film , @entity1 said most of the extended @entity28 clan " wanted to stay away from it			1
" i think they 've been very circumspect about this , because they lost two brothers , @entity233 and @entity28 , and it was very painful for them			0
" however , @entity235 did approach the director to discuss the film and @entity1 's theories , he said			1
" i did speak with him many years ago , before he died , " the director said			1
" he came to see me			0
he was interested in what happened , in my thoughts about what happened , " which resulted in a piece for the conspiracy issue of " @entity248 " magazine back in 1998			0
" i think conspiracies go on all the time , " @entity1 said			1
" i think accidents do , too			0
random accidents and conspiracies have existed side by side for centuries , definitely			0
it 's part of life			0
i 'm not an innocent in that regard			0
" but ask him about @entity260 conspiracies of recent times , and he hesitates			0
" i 'm not really into that kind of thinking			0
but the biggest conspiracy of all for me is the one i grew up under , which was sprouted by my father , a @entity269 conservative , and the entire establishment of this country , which was , ' hey , the @entity273 and the @entity274 are in a conspiracy to take over the world ! ' @entity277 added to the conspiracy , but they were saying , ' they 're in our schools			0
they 're in our police force			0
they 're in our government			0
they 're your back - door neighbor			0
' " " that 's a conspiracy , ok ? @entity289 was involved in a conspiracy that @entity85 was involved in 9/11			0
come on ! and he sold that conspiracy idea to all these big - shot news organizations			0
who 's kidding who ? conspiracies exist if you can see them			0
they make the enemy bigger than they are			0
" although @entity1 entertained the conspiracy talk with the anniversary and reissues , he did note that the one story about himself that he 'd like to see die is the one that makes him out to be the go - to conspiracy guy			1
" if you look at my body of work , every film is different			2
it 's confining if you 're always judging me by , ' oh , is there a conspiracy in it ? ' that 's ridiculous ! " for one thing , the film he had hoped to make but went to someone else was " @entity323			2
" as he laughed , " events conspired against me			0
" now - @entity327 congressman one of last to shake @entity3 's hand			1

@entity1 made a *splash* in 1991 with his film " @entity3 "
the director is rereleasing the movie on the 50th anniversary of the assassination
@entity1 stands by the theories in " @entity3 , " saying even more evidence supports his case now
