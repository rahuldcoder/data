-- @entity1 is well versed to talk about the pressures the modern day sport star faces			1
as a former world @entity5 and one half of a sporting super couple -- with tennis ace @entity9 -- the @entity4 knows all about living in the full glare of the media spotlight			2
so perhaps it is not surprising that the two - time major winner has warned that as the global interest in sport increases , so will players have to deal with the type of stress - related illness that prompted @entity21 cricketer @entity20 to pull out of the @entity23 tour			1
@entity20 's decision to come home from @entity26 has prompted a debate about the relentless schedule of many sports and the support on offer to players if they succumb to mental health issues			1
" it 's sad to see something like that happen and it just shows what a mental toll sport can take on you sometimes , " @entity1 told reporters at @entity35 , ahead of this week 's @entity36 as he talked about @entity20 's decision to leave the tour			1
" hopefully he gets home and spends some time with his family and recovers and can come back			0
" as sport becomes so big and there 's so much pressure and so much on the line , it 's becoming more and more common that these sorts of stress - related illnesses are happening and it just shows how much of a mental toll it takes on you sometimes			1
" the rivalry between the @entity21 and @entity26 cricket teams is one of the oldest and fiercest in world sport , with the players often exchanging insults on the pitch -- a practice known as " sledging			2
" the sledging in the current series , which @entity26 lead 1 - 0 after winning the first test match in @entity66 , saw @entity26 captain @entity69 fined for a barb aimed at @entity21 bowler @entity71			1
" i think the sledging this year has probably been a bit worse than other years as well , " said @entity1			2
" it looks like they 're just having a go at each other after every ball ... it would be really tough to take that for however long you 're out there for			0
" they seem to really get at each other 's throat whenever they 're in there			0
" for @entity1 , 2013 has been a frustrating year			0
since switching to playing with @entity88 clubs , he has struggled to recapture the form which saw him win four @entity90 and two @entity92 events in 2012 as well as the @entity93			0
" it 's been a long year , i guess mentally more than physically , " said the world no. 6			0
" physically , golf does n't take that much out of you but mentally it 's quite draining , especially this year for me , not just the golf and being frustrated with my game but having to answer the questions and having to come up with reasons why i 'm not playing well and all that stuff			0
" @entity1 will hope to end the year with a win , but he is up against a strong field in @entity35 featuring world @entity105 and home - crowd favorite @entity107			1
" i 've said for the last couple of months i just wanted to try and finish this season strongly and get some momentum to go into 2014 , " added the 24 - year - old @entity1			2
" this would be the perfect place to get that first win of the year and give me a sort of springboard into the next season			0
