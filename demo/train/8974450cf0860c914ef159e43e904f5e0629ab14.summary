@entity0 , @entity1 -- when the wind blows the wheat and the corn stalks glisten in the bright sun , it is easy to see why the @entity9 family has farmed @entity1 fields for nearly a century			0
@entity9 is a third - generation farmer			0
ever since he can remember , he has gotten cash payments from the federal government to help manage the risk of farming			0
" my grandfather emigrated here from @entity18 , so that 's when the farm started			0
we started with one farm , and as the years grew , my dad and uncle expanded the operation , and now today my brother and i are running the operation , " @entity9 said , standing between the house he grew up in and the fields where he played as a child			1
he calculates that the checks he gets from @entity32 average about $ 35,000 a year for his 2,000 acre farm , even in good times when he does n't need it			1
but for @entity9 and more than 1 million farmers across the country , that could soon come to a screeching halt			1
farm bill is set to reduce @entity42 deficit			1
does it add up ? the @entity44 is debating a farm bill that would end those payments , which have been in place in one form or another since the @entity49			1
the legislation was put together by @entity52 chairwoman @entity51 , a @entity53 , and sen. @entity54 , the top @entity55 on the committee			1
they sat down at the committee table and worked together -- a rare act of real bipartisanship in otherwise polarized times			0
" we have developed , i think , a wonderful working relationship , friendship , respect for each other			0
@entity54 came to @entity67 ; i went to @entity71 , " said @entity51 , sitting with @entity54 at the table where they negotiated the bill			1
" we had a chance to meet growers , great university researchers in both of our states to see the individual challenges of our states			0
and when you can get past all the , you know , just all the potshots and the partisanship and really listen to each other and talk to each other , that 's how you get things done , " @entity51 said			0
" people say back home all the time whether it 's @entity67 , @entity71 , any state , ' why ca n't you folks get along back there and do something instead of spinning your wheels and pointing fingers , ' " @entity54 said			1
the result of the bipartisanship : deficit reduction			0
according to the @entity97 , the farm bill will cut $ 23.6 billion in spending over 10 years			1
" $ 23.6 billion to the deficit			1
now some people think that 's not enough			0
some people think that 's too much			0
but we voluntarily came forward			0
the super committee did n't do that			1
no other authorizing committee has done that , " @entity54 said			0
how did they do it ? first , they went through the massive farm bill and cut out some antiquated and duplicative programs -- the kind of government waste that makes voters go berserk			1
for example , the federal government pays some farmers for crops they have n't grown in decades			1
" if you had cotton 20 years ago or wheat 20 years ago , you could still get a payment for that today			1
so we 're not going to pay for things you do n't grow anymore , " @entity51 said			1
and the senators say they would save $ 15 billion and fundamentally change farm policy in the @entity42 by doing away with direct payments to farmers , replacing them with taxpayer subsidized crop insurance			1
" we eliminated four different agriculture subsidies and instead have moved to risk management so we 'll support farmers and ranchers when there 's a loss , where there 's a weather loss , it 's a price loss , through crop insurance , through other things where the farmer has some skin in the game , " @entity51 said			1
@entity51 and her @entity55 partner have their critics			1
" unfortunately , it seems that @entity154 ' idea of farm bill reform is to eliminate one subsidy program only to invent a new one to take its place , " sen. @entity150 said on the @entity44 floor friday			2
watchdog groups warn the savings may not last because the crop insurance has no caps , and in bad crop years , the cost to taxpayers could explode			2
the authors scoff at that			0
it is a deficit - reduction cut			0
now it is true we all have a stake in making sure that farmers during bad weather -- we have had a horrible situation in @entity67 now , where cherries and apples and grapes and peaches have been hit because of weather situations			2
we want to make sure they do n't lose the farm , " @entity51 said			2
@entity54 added that in times of drought , flood or other forces of nature that hurt farmers , @entity154 generally passes disaster relief bills that cost billions and are bureaucratic nightmares			1
he argues that crop insurance would avoid that			0
" you would have to pay far more in these disaster programs , as opposed to a crop insurance program where a farmer can depend on it and a lender can depend on it , and it 's over the long term , " @entity54 said			2
@entity203 from @entity204 also criticizes the senators for not cutting more from the nearly trillion - dollar farm bill			1
" i find @entity51 's mantra of huge savings laughable			0
we could easily take $ 100 billion out of all these programs and not impact anyone negatively , " @entity203 said			1
back at the @entity9 farm , @entity9 says he is all right with losing checks from the government he does n't always need			2
" i 'd be happy to give up those subsidies if it 's going to help our country get its fiscal responsibilities back in order , " he said			2
but he calls new subsidies for his crop insurance critical , since farming is so unpredictable			2
last year , for example , he produced 35 bushels per acre , far below the 150 bushel goal			0
" if we did n't have the crop insurance , then it 's going to take , it takes three , four , five years of good years to make up for that one loss , " @entity9 said			1
even now , a good year , there are always problems brought by @entity234 beyond the farmers ' control			2
" if we sell it at high moisture , then they deduct the price because of the cost of drying it down , " @entity9 said			0
critics of the farm bill also say it has too much pork , but not the kind you think of when you think farming			1
this is the government waste kind of pork -- mostly in the form of popcorn			0
popcorn growers slipped in a provision making sure they , too , get government help with crop insurance			0
" the price of popcorn has risen 40 % in recent years , " @entity150 said on the @entity44 floor in front of pictures of popcorn buckets			2
" there is n't a kernel of evidence that they need this subsidy , " he said , appearing to enjoy his pun			2
@entity51 and @entity54 offered no apologies			0
" i guess i would call it a specialty crop			0
and there is demand for it ; just go to the movies or any place at home , " @entity54 said			0
any bipartisan effort will invite criticism from both sides of the aisle , and this one is no different			0
some @entity286 , the party in charge in the @entity44 , are livid because they say cuts go too deep for people who need it most			1
of the savings , $ 4.5 billion comes from cuts to the food stamp program			1
" these kinds of cuts , they hurt children , they hurt families , " sen. @entity294 said earlier this week on the @entity44 floor			1
@entity51 responded that they 're only cutting waste and fraud			0
for example , more than a dozen states use federal food stamp subsidies to give a dollar home heating credit for people who do not have a utility bill			1
" that 's where we 're saving dollars , and we 've done it in a very cautious and strategic way that brings integrity and accountability to the system but does not in any way affect the benefit structure , " @entity51 said			2
still some ask why farmers need any government help at all , especially since lately agriculture is one of the few sectors of the economy making huge profits			2
" we all have to eat , and when you look at it , agriculture 's one of the largest to trade surpluses we have and we can grow safe , affordable food here in this country			0
and i do n't think we can jeopardize that , " @entity9 said .			0

@entity286 and @entity55 senators say trimming subsidies could save $ 23.6 billion
feds pay some farmers subsidies for crops they have n't grown in years
critics say *proposal* could end up costing more than *current* system
others say food stamp cuts in bill would hurt those who need help most
