quizzed again on the subject thursday , she said , " i have been frank , and the fact is i would rather be honest , if ashamed , and explain the drug use rather than be bullied with lies about something that happened in a humiliating and very public way			1
" in light of her tribulations , she described 2013 as " the longest year of my life			0

@entity9 told the court the only thing she objected to was the story " that i was taking drugs at @entity53 , " a reference to an alleged claim by @entity31 that he was wiping cocaine from her nose at the restaurant			1
asked why she had n't sued @entity31 for libel over the claim , @entity9 said that she did n't have the money and did not want to go to court because her ex-husband enjoyed litigation			2
" i do not appreciate being bullied			0
i am not going to continue to be bullied , " she said			0
@entity9 said she felt it was her duty to come to court in this case			2
" i felt it would be an unpleasant experience , but that 's not an excuse not to do one 's civic duty			0

@entity92 's lawyer questioned @entity9 on thursday about exactly what her client was responsible for paying for			2
@entity9 rejected the notion that @entity26 had been given free rein to use the credit cards			1
" there were not written - down rules			0
... but it was known that they were not for personal use unless directed , " @entity9 said			1
" i do n't think any normal person would think that someone else 's credit card was for their personal use			2

@entity9 responded , " 7000 pounds of designer wardrobe ! no , i would not have said that			2
" asked if she had noticed that her personal assistant wore designer clothing , @entity9 said @entity26 had always claimed they were knock - offs or bought from a sample sale			1

@entity9 insisted , " i 've never been a drug addict , i 've never been an habitual user			2
... i did not have a drug problem , i had a life problem			0
" @entity31 had claimed in an e-mail that @entity9 had used drugs regularly , but in testimony friday , he backed off that claim			0
in the e-mail , which was shared with the court by the defense in a pretrial hearing , @entity16 wrote that the assistants would probably " get off " because @entity9 was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and " allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked			1
