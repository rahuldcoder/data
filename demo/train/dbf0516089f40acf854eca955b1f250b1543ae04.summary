@entity0 may have left the city , but on friday @entity3 founder @entity2 told a crowd of devotees gathered in @entity6 for the website 's annual " @entity9 " conference that the fugitive leaker 's actions had given him new ideas about the online encyclopedia 's future			1
" we live in the era of @entity0 and ( @entity24 founder @entity23 , " declared @entity15 in a keynote address to the crowd , which organizers said had over 500 people from 90 countries			1
" all kinds of information that people would prefer to remain secret or private are being exposed			0
" @entity15 said @entity0 's leaks about sweeping spy programs caused him to have a " serious rethink about security			1
" fearing intrusions from government agencies like the @entity35 in the @entity36 , @entity15 announced that @entity3 would move to encrypt its pages using @entity38 , or secure socket layer encryption , which protects users from outside monitoring			1
pointing to examples of poor mainstream media coverage on internet security issues , @entity15 also asked @entity45 to help him think of a new " hybrid model " of journalism , where volunteers could work with professional journalists to produce serious stories that would counter " tabloid nonsense " like stories about the girlfriend of @entity0 , the former @entity35 contractor who leaked some of the agency 's top secret programs to the media from a hotel room in @entity6 before receiving temporary asylum in @entity63			1
@entity15 showed an image of mainstream news clippings to prove his point			1
" ( @entity0 's girlfriend ) is heartbroken because he 's fled @entity70 ... he misses his girlfriend ... i do n't see anything here about who exactly is going to get arrested at the @entity35 for spying on people illegally , " he said			1
" what we really need to do is use editorial judgment to say , ' what really matters ? ' " he proposed a setup in which a carefully vetted volunteer community could be potentially be " in charge of " mainstream journalists			0
stressing that it was merely a brainstorm , the @entity3 founder invited his community to email him with software and design ideas			1
reactions to the @entity91 were mixed among attendees			0
" i think [ @entity15 ] did n't think about it very much , " said @entity93 , 35 , a @entity94 employee from @entity95			2
" you can not compare media that has to sell headlines to make them interesting to something like an encyclopedia			2
" " i do n't think it will replace traditional newspapers , " said @entity103 , who works for @entity94 in @entity104 , " but it should be an alternative			0
" in an interview with @entity15 said he had " great hope " that there would be demand for the idea			2
" some have this negativity that oh , the problem is the general public , they just want to read sexy stories about @entity120 or whatever , it 's hopeless , right ? " but you know what ? a website that 's more popular than the top 20 newspapers in the world combined is @entity3			1
and people are reading very serious things on @entity3			2
there 's clearly a demand from the public			0
" " i think it 's time we start being a little more radical in our thinking			0
" another key topic discussed at this year 's @entity9 was diversity			1
" i think @entity3 has a sexism problem , " said @entity93 , who runs a workshop in @entity138 that empowers women to write for @entity3			1
@entity93 says " harsh words for women " are still sometimes used to attack female users , particularly in debates over articles related to gender issues			0
but she acknowledged that " the huge majority of @entity3 is not sexist and very helpful			2
" she says just seven percent of the @entity95 @entity3 community are women , compared to 13 % of the general @entity3 population			1
@entity15 is aware of the imbalance			2
" we really want more women editing , " he told @entity15			1
" we 're doing a lot of outreach programs			0
" @entity45 say other inequalities also exist on the site			0
@entity157 , a @entity3 project director from the @entity158 , said he has seen " culture clashes " between @entity3 's " core demographic of white , highly - educated males in @entity163 countries " and editors of less - represented backgrounds			1
" an @entity36 administrator might delete an article about a school in the @entity158 because he thinks it 's ' not notable , ' which we would take personally , " he said			0
according to @entity157 , " systemic bias " from @entity175 has discouraged his team , and many editors have left			0
" there will always be some cultural conflict around the edges about what 's notable and not			0
and sometimes we make the wrong decisions			0
" " but we generally get it right because our community has a spirit of inquiry and desire of understanding			0
and it 's great if a member of our community stands up and says we 're doing this wrong , and you need to stop and think about it			0
" " one of the great things about the @entity45 -- that can be exhausting -- is we talk about everything , " said @entity15 .			2
