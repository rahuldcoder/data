-- in 1990 , @entity1 received a phone call that would change the course of his life			2
between his freshman and sophomore years at @entity8 , @entity1 's son @entity5 had schizophrenic break -- a mental episode that is often followed by a diagnosis of schizophrenia			2
from the moment they learned of their son 's illness , @entity1 and his wife , @entity18 , took on the disease and delved into the world of mental disorders in an attempt to end brain disease and the cultural stigmas attached to them			1
the @entity25 delved into piles of medical resources and found a dense array of research , studies and multiple professional options to the point that they were overflowing with information			0
as they waded through the options and got their son care he needed , the family realized the need for continued scientific advancements to understand the development of mental illness			1
so the @entity25 , who own @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity46 , decided to throw their own small benefit for mental health in their backyard			0
in 1995 , a small concert series began that harnessed top scientists , donors , and an array of entertainment , fine dining and of course wine			0
what started out as a community gathering to discuss mental health has turned into a major annual event with celebrity performances , top professionals and a sold out dinner that has raised more than $ 114 million for research efforts			2
in 2008 , with the growing success of the concert events , @entity1 co-founded the @entity68 ( @entity69 ) which allows for additional financial support across the nation and increases the ability to fund and propose research opportunities that might not otherwise be studied in the field of mental illness			1
the @entity25 wanted to not only to raise cash for fundraising for brain disease but remove the stigma of admitting you or a loved one suffer from one			1
" what we need to do is study and get all the basic circuits of the brain identified and understood , and once we have that super highway of information , the off ramp of these illnesses will be much more evident and much more proximate to us , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity81			2
former rep. @entity90 , who comes from one of the most recognizable @entity93 families , has been vocal of his battles with addiction and depression			2
it seemed only natural that when the two men met they would find friendship around a topic that has affected them both personally			0
@entity90 and @entity1 will unite together may 23 - 25 as they launch their new national initiative , " @entity105 , @entity106 " -- a new space for scientists , government , industry , academia , philanthropy , patients and their families			1
" the @entity105 " is a reference to @entity90 's uncle , president @entity116 , who embarked on a scientific mission of his own			1
@entity90 : brain research is the new ' moon shot ' this project aims to be a one - stop shop for the latest and best in specific development and treatments for those suffering from neurological diseases			1
" everything from @entity127 to @entity128 's , the entire spectrum of brain disorders ... we are going to unite the field , " said @entity1			1
domestic researchers , clinicians , scientists and policy makers will gather later this month in hopes of trailblazing a new map of the brain			0
both @entity90 and @entity1 hope this event can serve @entity93 in the same way the @entity142 does			1
@entity143 maintains websites for the winery and the family 's nonprofit research efforts with @entity69			0
after taking a year off from @entity8 and getting help for his schizophrenia , he graduated with a degree in engineering and is now doing his best to lead a normal life			0
@entity143 is an example of the success that 's possible with the right support , @entity1 said			0
" he is a role model for what can happen with people with these kind of illnesses			0
he is on the right medications , he is medically compliant but he is also very conversant and not in denial about the illness -- and that is the biggest problem with many people			0
they do n't really want to talk about their disorder ; they want to mask it			0
" and that 's what the @entity172 and @entity90 hope to do for all @entity93 who suffer with brain disease -- allow those individuals access to the best information possible about treatment options so they can remedy their ailment and live their best life .			1

family works to fund brain disease research , remove mental illness stigma
@entity90 , @entity1 will launch " @entity185 , @entity106 " may 23 - 25
" the @entity105 " aims to unite the entire spectrum of brain disorders
