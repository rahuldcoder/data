@entity0 -- the vote was 53 - 44 , and sen. @entity3 was on the losing side : democrats did not have enough votes to advance @entity8 legislation designed to guarantee women equal pay			1
" so i say square your shoulders , put your lipstick on , and let 's fight another day , " the always - colorful @entity12 @entity11 said			0
it was one vote in april , and there was never any doubt @entity5 would lose			2
but they held the vote to make a political statement , one many @entity5 strategists think is central to the party 's chances of improving its midterm election odds			1
as the @entity8 was voting , veteran @entity5 pollster @entity26 and his @entity29 project distributed a memo outlining the stark numbers and what @entity26 insists is an opportunity to improve them by @entity35			2
the downside , in his view : " @entity39 women are the key to 2014 , but are underperforming now on vote margin and turnout			2
... these voters are critical to @entity5 fortunes , but they are unlikely to vote , and less likely to give @entity5 big margins , if @entity5 are not laser - focused on issues that matter most to them			1
" this " intensity " question is paramount			0
history suggests that key pieces of the @entity5 coalition will turn out in lower percentages in this midterm year , including @entity55 , african - americans , younger voters and unmarried women			1
then , add in the @entity60 belief that a focus on president @entity63 's health care plan helps their 2014 intensity advantage			0
" this will be a challenge for @entity5 candidates this cycle , " @entity60 strategists @entity67 and @entity68 wrote in a recent memo			1
" voters who say a candidate 's position on the law will be a greater factor in determining how they vote are more opposed to the law			0
" the chart to the left illustrates their point			0
the question is how much of a factor the health care law will be in your 2014 vote			0
the challenge for the @entity5 , @entity26 and his colleagues argued this week , is to generate new @entity5 interest -- and intensity -- around economic issues that he says can be used to increase turnout if framed appropriately			1
in his surveys , @entity26 finds that 72 % of 2012 voters say they are " almost certain " to vote in 2014			0
but only 66 % of unmarried women say that			1
and at the same time their interest in voting is down , @entity26 warns -- as you can see in the chart to the left -- that the unmarried women who are planning to vote in november are not as supportive of the @entity5 as they were in 2012 ( though the current 2014 numbers are better than in @entity60 midterm rout of 2010 )			1
@entity26 and his client for this survey -- the @entity110 -- assert that @entity5 can motivate more women to vote if party candidates push an agenda that includes equal pay , equal treatment by insurance companies and more affordable child care			1
the @entity26 memo makes frequent references to the opportunity to motivate @entity5 voters and change the current midterm dynamics			1
if they do n't , his numbers and charts suggest a tough midterm year , especially when his assessment is matched with the previously cited @entity60 look at intensity around the health care issue			0
in addition to unmarried women , @entity26 looks at voting sentiment among a broader group he labels the " @entity133 " : unmarried women , young voters and people of color			1
many " @entity133 " voters are not planning to participate in 2014 , and that dropoff is a big @entity60 advantage			0
" democrats could leave a lot of deciding votes on the table , " @entity26 argues in urging a sharper and more consistent economic focus			2
" among voters likely to vote in 2014 , the generic ballot is tied			0
among those who voted n 2012 but who are not likely to vote in 2014 , @entity5 hold a 16 - point margin			2
this is a big deal			0
" and , if it does n't change , a big @entity60 advantage .			0

@entity5 strategists think equal pay is central to improving midterm odds
democrats must focus on issues *important* to unmarried women , a key bloc
@entity5 ' challenge is to increase *enthusiasm* around economic issues
