i fell in love on a monday night			1
now , many may say a teenage girl ca n't know about such things			0
but that night as i watched @entity5 running back @entity4 roll downfield 99 yards for a touchdown , i fell head - over - heels in love with the @entity8			1
it was january 3 , 1983 -- @entity10 , @entity11 vs. @entity12			0
i 'd never seen anything so inspiring			0
@entity4 was so free , so graceful and so powerful to me			0
he was focused and determined			0
watching him break free of his competitors , those who wanted to bring him down and stop him from reaching his goal , i was in awe			0
and i knew then that his run capsulized all that i wanted to accomplish in my life			0
that football game is one of my most cherished childhood memories			1
i have been a passionate @entity8 fan since that moment -- though i switched my loyalties to the @entity24 , my hometown team			1
my family has never understood my love affair with the league			2
they have balked as play dates , family events , even church services have been rearranged or skipped to fit my football calendar			2
i ended up spending much of my career in sports journalism , a dream job if ever there was one			2
but after 30 years , my love and respect for the game is fading			1
and i 'm seriously considering giving up football completely			2
i do n't want to , but i am left with little choice			0
i 've come to this pass because of a recent airing of " @entity45 , the @entity8 's @entity46 , " the @entity48 documentary that details the hidden story of the @entity8 and brain injuries			1
based on a book by journalists @entity53 and @entity55 , the program examines the @entity8 's attempt to cover up medical science that has linked @entity58 , called @entity58 , to concussions in @entity8 players			1
players with @entity58 have battled depression , memory loss , and in some cases dementia			1
the @entity8 consistently has denied any connection			1
but many of the men who play the game feel differently			2
" i think i 'm just paranoid			0
but ... from their standpoint , i think they are looking forward to covering their own ( butt ) more than anything , more than player safety , " @entity76 champion @entity75 told the @entity77 hall of famer @entity79 , whose concussion in 1994 was featured in the documentary , told @entity48 : " i do not have a son ; if i had a son , i would n't necessarily discourage him from playing football , but i do n't know that i would encourage him to play , either			1
... i do n't know what the data show , but i have n't sensed there 's been a reduction in head injuries			2
with that in mind , that 's concerning			0
as long as we 're having contact and as long as there are collisions , there 's going to be head injuries			0
" the @entity8 , which did not participate in the documentary , agreed in late august to a $ 765 million settlement in a concussion lawsuit with more than 4,500 players and their families			1
the proposed settlement allows the @entity8 to avoid a public trial to fight accusations that the league concealed what it knew about the dangers of head injuries			1
under the terms of the pending settlement , which is still awaiting approval by a judge , the @entity8 likely wo n't have to disclose internal files about what it knew , or when it knew of any links between concussions and permanent brain injury			1
when i watch the games today , the awe is gone			0
instead , i thank @entity123 that my son never wanted to play football , that it was basketball that stole his heart			2
and i find it ironic and a bit disingenuous that the @entity8 , in an effort to make the game more attractive to its 44 % female audience , adorns the players and the field in @entity136 pink			1
imagine where breast cancer research would be today if the science around the cause of the disease was rejected , or covered up			0
imagine if women were told to ignore the warning signs of this killer disease , or if we were denied access to lifesaving treatment			2
today , instead of telling kids how football helped to inspire me to go after what i want in life , i advise them and their parents to avoid the game at all costs			1
it 's not safe at any level			0
the @entity159 linebacker @entity158 , who was a leading voice in the documentary , does n't believe the game is safe for children today			1
" i pray parents understand all they 're getting into when they allow their kids to play football , " he said			1
" my oldest son luckily gravitated to basketball , and as a doctor he understands what concussions are about			0
my younger son did n't play , and to this day i 'm grateful , " said @entity158 , who begs his daughter not to let his grandson play			0
" because concussions happen all the time on every level of football , the long - term damage is terrible , and we 're seeing evidence of it all the time			1
i 've worked with former nflers who suffer blackouts in midsentence , after being diagnosed with numerous concussions over their careers			0
and many of us knew @entity189 and other football players who have taken their own lives			2
too many of us in the sports industry stood by and watched yesterday 's heroes implode , or fall into depression in retirement			2
it 's easy to sit back and pontificate about why so many players are violent , both on and off the field , or how they ended up with ruined lives			0
we often blamed the players themselves			0
" they were irresponsible men , or had bad agents , girlfriends , wives who took advantage of them , " we explained			0
we blamed everything but the game itself for so many ruined lives and serious psychological problems			2
now i see that i have been an enabler , blindly protecting the game -- the game that afforded me a lucrative career at @entity213			2
how could i criticize any @entity8 commissioner for doing the same ? we have all made a very comfortable living off the game and the backs of men like @entity158 , @entity4 and @entity189			1
i want to save my relationship with the league , but it needs to own up about @entity58			1
stop endlessly denying the findings of medical science that say playing football can cause permanent brain damage			1
just admit we have a problem			0
that is the first step			0
stop the slick marketing campaigns to keep telling our children all they need is to learn a " safe way to hit in football , " while denying each hit comes with a dire consequence			0
if my beloved @entity8 continues to lie and deny while men and boys are suffering and dying , then it 's time for this fan to say good - bye .			1

@entity241 says she fell in love with football 30 years *ago* ; became a sports journalist
she says new book and @entity48 documentary show @entity8 denied terrible effects of brain injury
she says she loves game , but now urges youngsters , parents to avoid it as too dangerous
@entity256 : too many have enabled this *deception* . @entity8 must own up to @entity58 caused by football
