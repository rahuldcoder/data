for sheer cruelty , they are well matched			0
they also share an apocalyptic " end - of - days " vision			1
now there are signs that @entity8 -- the most feared group in @entity9 -- may be edging toward a formal pledge of allegiance to the self - declared @entity12 of the @entity13 , @entity14			1
observers of @entity8 , which has inflicted years of terror on northern @entity17 , note that its actions in the last six months have frequently mimicked those of @entity19 -- from punishments such as stoning and beheading of its victims to taking territory and an increasingly sophisticated use of social media that 's very much in the @entity19 " style			1
" the latest sign that @entity8 is wooing @entity19 came on sunday with a series of tweets released by jihadist site @entity31 , which declared its own allegiance to @entity19 in december			1
one tweet quoted @entity8 's own media arm as saying : " we give you glad tidings that the group 's @entity39 is at the stage of consulting and studying , and we will let you know soon the group 's decision in respect to pledging allegiance to the @entity12 of the @entity47 @entity14 , may @entity48 preserve him , " according to a translation by @entity50			2
the message was purportedly posted on february 9			0
it 's an unusual if unverifiable commentary on @entity8 's internal processes			2
@entity54 , who follows @entity8 's operations and propaganda closely , says , " it is possible that due to factions within @entity8 the shura was unable to come to an agreement at this point			2
" " despite this , " @entity54 told @entity2 , " it 's clear @entity8 is leaning toward @entity19 in terms of doctrine , ideology and an emphasis on holding territory after operations			1
" in august last year , @entity8 declared its own " caliphate " -- after seizing the area around @entity71 in @entity72			2
at other times its media arm has spoken of the " @entity13 in @entity9 " and the " @entity13 in @entity9			0
" in terms of ideology , @entity8 's leader @entity76 has said that kidnappings and hostage - taking are approved in the @entity81 , a claim @entity19 also makes			1
" our hostages are @entity87 or corrupted @entity47 who follow the @entity89 way , " he said last year , referring to the schoolgirls kidnapped in @entity85 , @entity17 , most of whom remain missing			0
@entity19 later referred to the @entity85 abductions in its kidnapping of hundreds of @entity93 women and girls			2
@entity54 and other analysts point out that recent @entity8 videos have resembled the polished media productions of @entity19			1
@entity54 notes they " have the same choreography and lens angles as @entity19 , particularly its video of @entity101 in @entity102			0
" the group 's latest production -- released at the weekend and showing fighting around the town of @entity108 in @entity72 -- was a high - definition offering with advanced graphics , audio effects and gratuitous brutality that could easily have been produced by @entity19			2
@entity8 has also begun distributing photographs and videos through its @entity116 accounts , ( one of which was no longer accessible tuesday , february 24			2
) @entity8 has begun using @entity19 symbolism in its media productions and operations			1
the @entity17 press noted with alarm last july that @entity8 militants had been seen raising @entity19 ' rayat al - uqab flag along the @entity17 - @entity126 border			1
recent videos have featured the same flag			0
nor is @entity8 shy about appealing for help from @entity19			1
the message posted on february 9 requested the " mujahideen of the @entity13 to deliver our message to all @entity47 that your brothers in @entity17 are calling you to immigrate to us , to assist us in managing the areas in which we have control and fight the alliance of the disbelievers			0
" a formal pledge of allegiance may only occur once a positive response is assured			0
@entity8 's leader , @entity76 , has spoken in glowing terms of @entity145 and @entity19 , as well as @entity146 , saying last july : " my brethren ... may @entity48 protect you			1
" a recent video from the group featured an image of @entity145 in @entity152 , @entity153 , last year			0
so far , the response from @entity19 has been muted , especially when compared to @entity145 's very public proclamation of " provinces " in @entity157 and @entity158			0
one reason may be that @entity19 does n't altogether trust @entity76 -- whose pronouncements are often incoherent and meandering -- and perceives @entity8 to be disunited			1
@entity19 may also be wary of @entity8 's existing links with @entity162 ( @entity162 ) ; @entity146 and @entity19 are competing for leadership of the global jihadist movement			1
however , some factions within @entity162 have themselves pledged to @entity19 , and analysts note that some prominent supporters of @entity19 -- such as @entity168 -- have begun promoting statements and videos produced by @entity8			1
earlier this month , @entity172 national counterterrorism center director @entity171 told a congressional hearing that there was " increased intercommunication between @entity8 and other terrorist groups in the northwestern part of @entity9 and even with @entity19 , " using another acronym for @entity19			1
in an interview with the @entity182 newspaper last weekend , @entity157 foreign minister @entity179 said that " groups associated with @entity8 have been detained " in @entity157 and spoke of a " dreadful terrorist network between is in @entity185 and @entity153 , [ partners ] in @entity157 and @entity187 , and @entity8			0
" that may suggest the emergence of a broader front stretching from northern @entity17 through the @entity191 to the @entity192			0
@entity8 fighters already have experience in that region : a number joined the @entity198 insurgency which seized the northern half of @entity187 in 2012 before being driven out by a @entity201 - led intervention force			2
@entity8 already has a sophisticated smuggling network that reaches far beyond @entity17 -- into @entity126 , @entity203 and @entity204 -- and taking advantage of poorly policed borders			0
@entity54 , who is an analyst at the @entity207 , says the fact that @entity31 released recent messages may itself be ominous			0
he says it " is closely affiliated to @entity211 jihadist brigades that already pledged loyalty to @entity13 in 2014			0
" " given @entity19 penetration in @entity211 and @entity157 , and @entity8 's logistical connections to @entity215 , " says @entity54 , " it would not be surprising if @entity215 jihadists helped make the segue between @entity19 in @entity153 and @entity185 and @entity8 in northeastern @entity17			1
" further evidence of @entity19 sympathizers in @entity211 emerged monday , when the @entity211 @entity221 announced the arrests of about 100 alleged extremists , and published a video allegedly showing the group possessed a formula for making explosives and a photograph of @entity145			0
it 's estimated that between 2,500 and 3,000 tunisians have traveled to @entity153 and @entity185 , most to join @entity19			0
another part of @entity8 's strategy that may borrow from @entity19 is its concentration on creating its own space either side of international borders			1
just as @entity19 has carved out its " caliphate " on both sides of the @entity185 - @entity153 border , so @entity8 has focused on @entity72 , which borders both @entity126 and @entity204			1
@entity76 has castigated ( as has @entity19 ) the colonial - era borders separating @entity47 , saying once : " we do n't know @entity126 or @entity204 ... i do n't have a country			2
" and earlier this month he declared in another video : " @entity243 people of @entity126 ! o people of @entity204 ! repent to @entity48 the @entity245			0
know that one can not be a muslim but by disavowing democracy			0
" once seen as an exclusively @entity17 movement , @entity8 's horizons are broadening to the north and east , prompting closer military co-operation by the governments of @entity17 , @entity204 and @entity126 , whose latest offensive appears to be putting @entity8 on the defensive in some parts of the border region			0
when and whether there will be a formal alliance between @entity8 and @entity19 is still very much open to debate -- but at the very least the @entity17 group 's shifting priorities , behavior and presentation is another sign of @entity19 ' far - reaching influence among jihadist groups			1

@entity8 and @entity19 share an apocalyptic " end - of - days " vision , writes @entity271
@entity8 has also begun using @entity19 symbolism in its media productions and operations , he says
@entity271 : whether there will be a formal alliance between them is still very much open to debate
