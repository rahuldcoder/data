-- here at an international gathering of @entity8 specialists currently underway in @entity9 , @entity10 , the actions of @entity3 prime minister @entity2 in honoring his country 's war criminals have come in for sharp criticism			1
nobody attending the @entity14 conference seems surprised , but i have yet to meet anyone who thinks @entity2 has done @entity8 any favors			2
one attendee suggests that , in sending a personal message to a ceremony commemorating @entity8 's war criminals , @entity2 has yet again handed a strategic gift to @entity23 and @entity24 , while making @entity8 look churlish about its war responsibility			1
another said that if chancellor @entity28 made a similar gesture repudiating the verdicts against @entity32 war criminals at @entity33 , her political career would end and @entity34 would face strong condemnation and isolation in @entity37			2
so yet again prime minister @entity2 has scored an own goal on history through sending a message to the ceremony , held at the sacred site of @entity44 in the mountains of @entity46 in april this year			0
' foundation of the fatherland ' the site is the heartland of the @entity52 sect of @entity53 and is designated as a @entity54			0
the ceremony is held annually at the @entity57 cemetery , where there is a statue inscribed with the names of 1,180 war criminals , including the 14 class - a war criminals enshrined at @entity63 in @entity64			0
the statue was erected 20 years ago with the explicit objective of restoring the honor of these war criminals and honoring their sacrifice " for the foundation of the fatherland			2
" an inscription on the statue decries the punishment of war criminals by the @entity75 powers as " a harsh and retaliatory trial never before seen in the world			0
" @entity2 's message was read out at the ceremony on april 29 this year , but only came to light this week			1
chief cabinet secretary @entity80 told a press conference that the message was not sent in @entity2 's capacity as prime minister , and as such the government would not comment on it			1
according to @entity3 newspaper the @entity87 , @entity2 's message stated : " i would like to sincerely express my feelings of remembrance to the spirit of the @entity94 era martyrs who staked their souls to become the foundation of their nation so that @entity8 could achieve the peace and prosperity of today			1
" defenders of @entity8 's wartime conduct commonly use the phrase " @entity94 era martyrs " -- which refers to the period of @entity3 history corresponding to the 1926 - 89 reign of @entity106 -- to refer to the war criminals			1
this is how they are described at the @entity110 on the grounds of @entity63 , the talismanic site for those who seek to glorify @entity8 's devastating war of imperial aggression in @entity115 from 1931 to 1945			1
it is not the first time @entity2 has sent a message for the @entity119			0
last year , he wrote : " i want to establish the existence of a new @entity8 that would not be an embarrassment to the spirit of the war dead			0
" perhaps , but many living @entity3 are embarrassed by his efforts to burnish @entity8 's wartime record			2
' disingenuous ' excuse @entity2 's spokesman said that his statement , and offerings at @entity63 twice this year , were made in his private capacity			1
apparently @entity2 is under the illusion that he can call a timeout as @entity8 's political leader whenever it suits him			1
this is disingenuous , but a dubious sleight of hand that @entity8 's leaders often invoke when trampling on the dignity of @entity8 's wartime victims			2
world leaders do n't get to declare timeouts			0
although most @entity3 do n't share @entity2 's enthusiasm for @entity8 in jackboots , @entity8 suffers from @entity2 's revisionist views because he is the nation 's leader 24/7 and the world scrutinizes all of his words and gestures			1
by showing a lack of contrition about the horrific suffering @entity8 inflicted on much of the rest of @entity115 , @entity2 has inflamed tensions with @entity23 and @entity24 , and left @entity8 even more isolated			1
@entity64 's friends in @entity154 cringe every time @entity2 lets loose one of his boomeranging salvos on history			0
like most @entity3 they wonder why @entity2 ca n't just stick to @entity157 and leave history to the historians			0
there are good reasons why @entity3 are proud of what @entity8 has accomplished since 1945 in promoting peace and prosperity in the @entity164			0
but by trying to rehabilitate an era when @entity8 ran amok in @entity115 , @entity2 keeps everyone 's focus on @entity8 's embarrassing 20th century misadventures			1
@entity2 insists that his door is " always open " for dialogue with @entity23 and @entity24 , but his knack for slamming it in their faces by trying to airbrush the past keeps @entity8 isolated in northeast @entity115			1
what is he thinking ? why would @entity2 make such a gesture , given the predictable consequences for @entity8 's regional relations ? it is not just myopia that explains @entity2 's blunders			1
@entity2 is waging a culture war to redefine @entity3 national identity , one that he thinks is way too masochistic			0
he wants to nurture pride and patriotism among @entity3 and , for him , that means revising history			0
@entity2 is a true believer and his gestures are a message to his political base that he has not given up the fight to overturn the postwar order imposed by the @entity196 , including what he views as the unjust verdicts handed down by the @entity199 for the @entity200 , aka the @entity201			0
earlier this year he caved into @entity196 pressure to pledge he would not overturn the 1993 @entity203 in which @entity8 acknowledges its responsibility for the comfort women system , having earlier made noises that he might do so			0
@entity154 is eager to get its two @entity115 allies , @entity8 and @entity24 , talking again , but this been difficult because @entity2 's revisionist views on history deeply offend @entity211			1
@entity2 's reassurances about the @entity203 was the minimum necessary to convince president @entity214 to agree to meet with @entity2 and president @entity215 in the @entity216 on the sidelines of a nuclear proliferation summit			2
chilly reception but @entity2 's minor concession got a chilly reception in @entity222			2
he is known there for his apologist views about the comfort women system and quibbling about the level of coercion used in recruiting tens of thousands of young women to serve as wartime sex slaves for the @entity3 armed forces			0
moreover , a month after signaling he would not repudiate the @entity203 , @entity2 sent his message praising the war criminals			1
and his supporters in the @entity234 proceeded with an investigation of the comfort women system aimed at discrediting the @entity203 , a damaging hit - and - run attack aimed at sowing doubts among @entity3 who are showing signs of perpetrator 's fatigue and the burdens of war responsibility			0
the attack was also red meat for @entity2 's reactionary base			2
@entity2 's defiant and unrepentant attitudes towards history are unlikely to change enough to satisfy the neighbors			2
but will they continue to cold shoulder @entity8 ? president @entity214 is under a lot of @entity196 pressure to get over the past so that plans to jump - start a strategic dialogue next month might proceed			0
but a meeting with @entity23 president @entity258 on the sidelines of the @entity260 in @entity261 now looks more difficult due to @entity2 's actions , which ensure that @entity8 's wartime past continues to cast a long shadow into the 21st century			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity267 .			0

@entity8 's @entity269 has drawn criticism for a message honoring war criminals
his spokesman says the comments were made in a private capacity
but @entity2 can not call a timeout as leader whenever it suits him , says @entity267
