-- the evolving life , face and story of @entity4 , disfigured by the @entity5 and featured on the august 2010 cover of @entity7 , has captivated audiences around the world			1
@entity0 has been following her for close to two years and , earlier this week , updated readers on how she is doing both physically and emotionally			1
we shared exclusive photographs of what she looked like before her latest surgery			2
monday 's procedure , the fourth in a series to reconstruct her nose , lasted about 9Â½ hours and went smoothly , said @entity23 , who 's become a father figure to @entity25			1
doctors at @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29 , where she 's being treated , will not discuss her case			1
the reactions to the latest story about @entity4 poured in -- both in the story 's comments section and by way of e-mail -- even as the world 's eyes remained trained on friday 's mass shooting at @entity42 in @entity43			1
" this girl has more courage than all the fanatics that hurt her will ever have , " wrote akmac61			2
" @entity4 you are a beautiful woman , wishing you the best ! a whole new great life is ahead just for you , better things are coming , " said tr0j4n			1
" i am speechless , no words can express the depth of my feeling for this beautiful lady			0
i salute your courage in the face of illiteracy and extremism , " added @entity57			1
some readers wrote with special offerings for @entity4 and the family caring for her			1
an e-learning company in @entity66 wants to help with her education			0
the owner of a bed and breakfast in @entity72 would like to treat them to a weekend getaway			0
a woman in @entity76 encouraged @entity4 to open a web - store , perhaps on @entity78 , to sell her jewelry			1
many others wrote with promises of prayers and extensions of love			0
as is so often the case when @entity0 mentions @entity87 or simply the @entity89 world , there were inevitably readers who took this opportunity to attack that faith			1
but more readers pushed back , perhaps hinting at decreased tolerance for such prejudices			1
there was also a fresh perspective brought on by the tragedy in @entity99 , @entity43			1
" i guess in the @entity5 , everybody with a twisted opinion gets to play @entity104 , " wrote onaturalia			0
" and unfortunately some in the @entity106 , " responded are122			0
" exactly , and they are not all @entity89 , " said @entity107			0
further down in the comments , @entity109 added , " i agree 100 %			0
@entity111 does n't teach hate			0
" " then why do @entity89 do so many inhumane things ? " asked swarm4			0
" was @entity115 a @entity89 ? no , " answered @entity116			0
" inhumane things are inherent in all humans			0
some just act on them while the rest of us do n't			0
" some , who wrote to me directly , shared that the story about @entity4 was a salve for the sadness that had befallen the country			1
" it was especially nice to read after the horrors of @entity99 , " wrote one person			0
" it did my soul some good to read such a hopeful story and to learn about the @entity135 ' kindness and good will at a time like this , when everything seems pretty dark in the @entity106 , " wrote another			1
" in a time filled with tragedy and sorrow , thank you for an uplifting and positive article , " wrote a third			2
a couple of readers seemed bent on offending @entity4 , those who care for her and pretty much everyone else , by making comments directed at her looks -- as if she had any control over them			1
but plenty of readers stood up for her , including @entity155 , who wrote , " she will be beautiful again			2
the surgery will repair her mutilations , but nothing can repair the ugliness displayed by some posters here			0
stupid ca n't be fixed			0
" some readers wondered why the country would help her instead of others			2
" who is paying for the surgery ? do n't you think there are enough disfugured ( sic ) citizens in this country who needs ( sic ) more attention ? " asked @entity169			0
in response , @entity176 wrote , " you misspelled ' i need a heart implant			0
' " a handful of readers latched onto information in the story about how @entity183 , @entity4 's mother figure and a former @entity185 in @entity186 , is struggling to find her way in @entity106 's medical community			1
if she wants to practice medicine here , she must start over in a residency program -- and so far she 's had no luck getting into one			2
if she ca n't , the whole family , @entity4 included , may end up moving to @entity186			1
" concerning @entity183 's plight , one has to ask what is going on in the @entity106 concerning attracting and keeping good doctors , " wrote bob			2
" from what i am hearing , the @entity106 does n't sound like a land of opportunity but instead a country representing endless bureaucratic roadblocks , dogma and special interests			0
" answered @entity206 : " until there is an international standard for medical education and training , i am happy that such requirements exist			0
" there were lessons that readers from across the globe took away from the piece			2
a reader in @entity218 , who previously had not felt connected to @entity4 's story , wrote , " it is the right thing to shout it to the world , to make clear there is no acceptance to barbarism and abuse			1
" added a writer from @entity227 : " am very happy the way you @entity106 are helping people all over the world			2
" and then there was this one , from a young woman who saw in @entity4 's story something she knows too well			1
" this is @entity236 from miles away , @entity238			0
i read your story on @entity240 early this morning on the @entity0 website and it overwhelmed me with emotions i usually try to bury			2
i am 22 too like her and part of a society that may not bruise my body but wounds my soul and self confidence everyday			0
stories like @entity4 's inspire us , girls , struggling to live a normal and deserved life			1
