@entity0 -- less money means less military , the nation 's armed forces chiefs told @entity6 on wednesday			1
the heads of the @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 explained -- again -- to the @entity12 that their services will be unable to meet their strategic responsibilities if forced budget cuts in coming years take effect as planned			1
the forced cuts , known in @entity0 - speak as sequestration , affect the military and other discretionary government spending except for entitlement programs such as @entity22 and @entity23			2
at wednesday 's hearing , the military chiefs all said sequestration cuts in coming years would leave their forces without the resources needed to fulfill the requirements of the @entity32 administration 's strategic defense guidance for the military through 2020			1
" these reductions will put at substantial risk our ability to conduct even one sustained major combat operation , " army chief of staff gen. @entity34 told the panel , adding that it was " imperative that @entity6 not implement the tool of sequestration			1
" calling himself a realist , @entity34 said the end result would be an 18 % cut in total @entity8 forces over seven years			2
" there are some who have suggested there will be no land wars in the future , " @entity34 said			0
" while i wish that were true , unfortunately there is little to convince me that we will not ask our soldiers to deploy again in the future			0
" past reductions in military readiness showed that " the full burden of an unprepared and hollow force will fall directly on the shoulders of our men and women in uniform , " he added			0
" we have experienced this too many times in our nation 's history to repeat this egregious error again , " he said			0
the hearing came amid another budget war in @entity6 , with threats of a government shutdown in less than two weeks without a compromise			2
one issue in the budget debate is whether a new spending plan should contain the sequestration cuts forced by a 2011 budget deal			1
both democrats and @entity84 say they do n't want sequestration , but they can not agree on a new spending plan			0
@entity84 insist on holding overall spending to the level that included the sequestration cuts , while @entity83 generally want to provide some more funding while adjusting spending levels			1
@entity1 's @entity92 contributed to this report .			0
