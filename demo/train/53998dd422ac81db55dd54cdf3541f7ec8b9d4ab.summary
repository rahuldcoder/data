@entity0 -- in the schoolyard of @entity5 politics , president @entity2 is the big , smart kid with all of the test answers who 's being bullied by a bunch of @entity10 ankle - biters from all sides			1
meanwhile , all the teachers are wondering , " why does he take this crap ? he 's bigger and smarter than all the other kids			1
" it 's no surprise the @entity16 of the world have been attacking @entity2 since the moment he stepped into the @entity19			1
@entity20 and his blathering buddies on the right -- you know , the stinky kids in the coatroom who eat their own boogers			2
always pick on the kids least likely to fight back			0
that being said -- we did elect president @entity2 to change things , and so far the only thing he seems to be changing are his faux - patriotic lapel pins ... and his mind			1
with the public option in the public toilet , not asking or telling about " do n't ask , do n't tell , " the @entity40 still entertaining guests , and same - sex marriage so far off @entity2 's radar that it 's now on his sonar , seeds of doubt have been planted in the left 's collective mind			1
if this guy ca n't get his own party to step in line on health care reform , they wonder , then how the hell will he get other countries to do what he wants them to do ? although in some ways , that might be easier then dealing with these @entity57 who hump your leg ... and not in a good way			0
it 's a valid concern			2
however , we ca n't expect him to accomplish all this sweeping change in less than a year			2
it 's important that he lay the groundwork instead of just going all " decider " on everyone and making gut choices			2
but he ca n't just be " the thinker , " either			0
last time i looked , " @entity78 , " by @entity75 , had been sitting on his butt in the exact same place , for years			0
unfortunately , laying groundwork does n't win you any fans -- well , besides a few @entity83 voters on the @entity85 panel			0
flexing muscles , now that wins you fans			0
that 's why the @entity91 said it 's time for president @entity2 to pick a fight and win it in a knockout			1
but instead of working on that knockout , president @entity2 and his @entity95 cronies are feuding with @entity97			1
while i 'm loving this @entity97 hunt , the @entity95 's strategy boggles my mind			1
this is not a war of necessity			0
picking a fight with them is kinda like going to a biker bar after midnight -- as my mother used to say , " nothing good can happen			0
" that is , unless this heavyweight bout keeps escalating and we actually get to see @entity20 prancing around in a pair of sequined boxing shorts			0
when you disregard the action against @entity97 , @entity2 seems to be paralyzed , like a frog that 's had it stomach rubbed -- which may the reason he 's got problems on both sides of the lily pad			1
admittedly , i might be overreacting just a bit			0
the majority of the country is behind @entity2			1
the situation just seems worse than it is because we 're not used to this new era , in which you can actually criticize the president without being shouted down as an unpatriotic , @entity135 , traitorous , granny - killing , freedom hater			2
after eight years of a presidency shrouded in darkness , we 're not used to seeing the president 's supporters , of all people , shining a light on his shortcomings			2
back to the schoolyard , where @entity2 is being bullied			1
you know what ? he 's big , he can take it			1
you know why ? because not only is he right in his beliefs , but he knows that if push comes to shove , he can lay out the rest of these runts with a couple of good smacks of his presidential pen			0
it 's not time to panic , but president @entity2 needs to size up one of these twerps , cock back his arm , and take a swing soon , because the @entity163 majorities in @entity164 wo n't last forever			1
president @entity2 won 53 percent of the vote last november , so we know he has it in him to win the big battles			1
we know he has a lot on his plate			0
but we just want one decisive victory			0
that 's all we 're asking for			2
show these class clowns who they 're messing with			0
you do n't have to be " @entity179			0
