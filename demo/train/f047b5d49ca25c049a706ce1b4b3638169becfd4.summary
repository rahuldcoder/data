one of the most anticipated @entity1 decisions in recent times -- @entity3 -- was not announced monday			1
that gave an air of anti-climax to an important decision that was handed down , one with its own political baggage and implications for the election , although not nearly as fraught with peril as the health care law			0
in any other session , the outcome of @entity14 v. @entity15 might have been the headline case of a @entity1 season			2
instead , the @entity20 administration will have to celebrate an incomplete victory in the next 72 hours before the court delivers its ruling on the fate of @entity20 's signature legislation			1
the @entity26 largely won in challenging @entity14 's harsh 2010 immigration law , although it might be difficult to sell that point			1
last year , the 9th @entity29 struck down four provisions of the law , ruling that the federal government pre-empted state regulation on immigration			2
unfortunately for the administration , the @entity1 reversed the lower court on the most controversial part of the law , the " show me your papers " provision that requires law enforcement officers to check the immigration status of people while enforcing other laws			1
arguably , this provision was designed to force the federal government to take action on illegal immigrants by identifying them to the @entity52			0
by upholding this provision , the @entity1 allowed gov. @entity53 to claim victory for @entity14 's immigration enforcement efforts : " today 's decision by the @entity15 @entity1 is a victory for the rule of law			1
it is also a victory for the 10th amendment and all @entity15 who believe in the inherent right and responsibility of states to defend their citizens			0
after more than two years of legal challenges , the heart of @entity69 can now be implemented in accordance with the @entity72			0
" but that narrow win is tenuous			0
the court pointedly did not rule that the provision was constitutional , which means that further court cases may well strike it down at a later date			0
@entity14 can put it into effect , but it probably wo n't take too much time before a case comes up that will put the provision back under scrutiny			2
the @entity26 will portray the @entity1 's ruling on immigration as a principled victory over a state that had infringed on federal prerogatives to manage immigration			2
it may even get a couple of days ' worth of traction on that argument			0
that wo n't last long , though , for two reasons			0
first , the coming @entity3 ruling will vastly overshadow this nuanced win by thursday morning			1
second , this win serves as a reminder that the @entity20 administration has done a poor job of enforcing immigration law -- and along with @entity20 's recent decision to stop deporting some young illegal immigrants -- border states have no reason to expect a second term that will improve on the first .			1

@entity110 : high court ruling on @entity14 immigration law is largely a win for *president*
@entity110 : ruling is an incomplete win since the fate of @entity3 coming within days
