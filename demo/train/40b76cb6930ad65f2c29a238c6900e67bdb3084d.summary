-- it 's been well more than a week since @entity2 went missing			1
with few hard facts to work from , experts -- and the public -- are conjuring up and sharing theories on what became of the commercial airliner carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew members			1
its disappearance -- as if into thin air -- is disturbing in our age of continuous connectivity			0
as a result , no speculation seems off limits , no matter how dark			0
as aviation expert @entity23 put it : " i do n't think you can discount any theory , frankly			0
" and so , the theories are plentiful			2
speculation : pilot suicide any traveler abhors the notion of a crew member bent on annihilation			1
for example , @entity34 was flying 217 people from @entity37 to @entity38 to @entity39 in 1999 when it crashed into the @entity40			0
@entity42 officials blamed a co-pilot , who was recorded repeating a prayer , for deliberately causing the crash , but @entity47 officials blamed mechanical problems			0
the @entity51 flight , a @entity52 777 , could have experienced destruction by pilot or crew , some say			1
is there a clue in pilot psychological evaluations ? " it 's my belief that there was probably some type of struggle in the cockpit where it was one of the pilots that maybe had a meltdown or did something nefarious to the airplane , " said @entity23 , a retired @entity59 pilot captain who has flown the @entity52 and now works at the @entity61 consulting firm @entity60			1
or there could have been another crew member or an uninvited or invited guest in the cockpit who " was bent on perhaps committing suicide or doing some destruction on the aircraft , " @entity23 added			1
though improper , pilots allowing guests into the cockpit is possible and " should be disconcerting to anybody , " @entity23 said			0
he was referring to reports of how copilot @entity86 , 27 , had once invited a woman and her friend into the cockpit in a 2011 flight between @entity91 and @entity92			0
" that 's an enormous breach of security , " @entity23 said of cockpit guests			2
but none of us will know what really happened in the cockpit " until we have the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder , " @entity23 said			0
@entity102 : did terrorists take control of flight 370 ? speculation : commandeering @entity110 is n't to be confused with hijacking , a political act in which demands are issued by the hijacker , said @entity0 national security analyst @entity112			1
a commandeering is more idiosyncratic , where motives are n't immediately clear , @entity112 said			1
some counterterrorism officials say that could be the case with the @entity92 flight , @entity112 said			0
" the plane could have been commandeered , " @entity112 said			2
commandeered flights have a history -- prior to the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity42 , @entity112 said			0
for example , in 1994 , the cargo plane @entity124 was commandeered by an employee with a hammer and spear gun who burst into the cockpit and wanted to crash the plane into @entity133 's @entity132 , headquarters			1
the crew thwarted that takeover			1
in 2000 , a passenger with a suspected mental history commandeered a @entity139 between @entity140 and @entity141 and put the plane carrying 300 passengers into a nosedive until the crew subdued him			1
" so commandeering would fit with the few facts that we do know and certainly a theory that we have n't heard a lot of that is n't a conspiracy , " @entity112 said			0
pilots , passengers of flight under scrutiny speculation : hijacking that the plane terminated transponder data before its disappearance leads some experts to suspect a hijacking occurred			1
the political motivation of such a hijacking , however , would be as mysterious as the plane 's whereabouts			1
" if you are dealing with hijackers on board the aircraft , whether it was an organized gang , or whether it was some psychologically disturbed individual that ... managed to gain access to the flight , they can neutralize the crew , " said @entity167 , editor of @entity168			2
" but then again , there would n't necessarily be any communication at all -- as we witnessed on september 11th , " @entity167 added , referring to the terror attacks in the @entity42			0
" if there was an explosive decompression , if a bomb detonated on board the aircraft , then again there would be no communication			0
" one motive could be terrorism			0
authorities have n't ruled out this possibility , though some experts are divided on this theory , partly because no terrorists have claimed responsibility at a moment when they would have the world 's attention			1
" there might be another reason for them not coming forward at this point , " @entity201 , former executive assistant director of the @entity202 , said			0
" if it was a terrorist incident ... if this was part of a much larger or broader potential act , and for whatever reason , they would n't come forward at this point , but at a later time			0
" speculation : mechanical failure in a less sinister but equally lethal explanation , some experts theorize the plane mysteriously crashed somewhere because of mechanical malfunction			1
perhaps it was an electrical failure			0
it 's possible , though pilots have trouble embracing the thought			2
" i 've been running that in my brain now ever since this thing happened , " said @entity226 , an aviation expert and retired @entity59 pilot			2
" one possibility would be a total electrical failure which is very , very hard to imagine because it has so many generators coming from different places , " @entity226 said			0
" if all the engine generators fail , they still have what 's called the @entity238 ( ram air turbine )			2
that 's the generator that literally falls out of the bottom of the airplane , has a propeller on it , and ram - air turns that and gives them generating power enough to go ahead and fly the airplane safely			1
" electrical failure -- it 'd have to be total ... absolutely incredible like we 've not heard of before , " @entity226 said			0
could flight have slipped by radar ? speculation : the bizarre not constrained by professional accountability as the experts are , internet users have offered their own theories			1
a meteor struck the plane			2
some country 's military shot down the plane			1
the plane landed on a remote island			1
with no answers and contradictions and questions increasing , the theories , creative conjecture and pure speculation abound			1
" everybody wants to get a handle on something right now , " former @entity275 investigator @entity274 said of conflicting theories			2
" no one has an answer , so they 're going to try to put one on it			0
so that creates all kinds of assumptions			0
" @entity0 's @entity288 , @entity289 and @entity290 contributed to this report .			2

experts conjecture that pilot or crew may have been bent on suicidal destruction
@entity110 is a takeover of a plane with idiosyncratic motives
termination of plane 's transponder leads some to think a hijacking may have occurred
the bizarre theories *includes* meteors , remote islands , military shoot - down
