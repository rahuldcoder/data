even in celebrity - obsessed @entity1 , too much attention can be a bad thing			1
so as @entity4 got back to work last week , two freshman stars -- @entity8 sen. @entity7 and @entity10 rep. @entity9 -- were trying to figure out how to navigate the spotlight , and in some cases , duck it			1
@entity7 , a conservative favorite , is the first woman to represent the @entity8 in the @entity17 while @entity9 is the @entity19 's first black female @entity18			1
@entity7 , a political unknown who rose to fame in 2014 with an ad promising she could cut pork in @entity1 because of her experience castrating hogs on her family farm , has signaled her media strategy by declining interviews since her election from anyone other than @entity8 outlets			1
" what we really want to do is focus on @entity8 , " she told the @entity33			2
over the holidays , @entity9 had told a local @entity10 public radio outlet that she would try to avoid national media attention and focus on representing her district			2
but she has been a visible presence on the national stage since her win in november and during her first week in @entity1			1
she agreed to a feature in @entity45 with her family at their @entity48 home			2
she made her first appearance on a sunday show last week and spoke to @entity51 on thursday night about her vote on legislation related to @entity54			1
on friday morning , she joined other @entity19 members on the floor to read aloud from the @entity57			2
" one of the best pieces of advice that @entity59 used to give incoming senators was to be a workhorse , not a show horse , " said @entity58 , a former senior adviser to @entity59 and @entity60			2
incoming members , " regardless of their celebrity have to demonstrate that they are willing to roll up their sleeves , reach across party lines and get things done			0
if you do that successfully , then you are setting yourself up for whatever you want to do next			0
" as these two women navigate their way through the power corridors of @entity1 , they do not have to look far to see the damage that can be inflicted by overexposure			1
after her meteoric rise in 2008 , former @entity85 gov. @entity84 's once promising career plummeted to the realm of reality television			1
the polarizing antics of @entity91 sen. @entity90 have drawn the animus of his colleagues and are likely to limit his presidential ambitions			0
in a recent op - ed for the @entity96 , former @entity98 sen. @entity97 , a @entity18 , said that when it came to working with @entity90 " the collective membership of the world 's greatest deliberative body would rather stick needles in their eyes			1
" so far , @entity7 and @entity9 have pledged bipartisanship and careful attention to constituents of all political stripes			1
at one of her receptions on @entity110 this week , @entity7 spoke about her plans to hold town halls in all 99 counties of @entity8 this year — following the tradition of senior sen. @entity115 , who has been doing the tour known as " the @entity117 " for more than 30 years			1
on friday , @entity7 's political action committee announced that she would host a " @entity119 " in @entity8 in june			1
the hogs and @entity122 - themed event was a nod to her roots and former @entity8 sen. @entity126 's famed steak fry , which has lured many presidential candidates to @entity8 in recent years			1
" she was n't elected to become a political celebrity , she was elected to serve the people of @entity8 , " said @entity128 , an @entity8 - based @entity18 strategist who advised @entity7 during her @entity17 campaign			1
" it 's part of the @entity8 culture to be humble and not to call attention to yourself			1
@entity137 respect people who understand that they are working for them			0
" in these early days , @entity9 's election is frequently cited by colleagues as an example of growing diversity in the @entity18			1
while she acknowledged her historic win on election night , @entity9 has also signaled that she will resist the efforts of others to define her by her race and gender			0
when people have tried to draw her into those debates , she told the @entity152 public radio affiliate @entity151 , " i said , ' do n't label me			0
first and foremost , i 'm a wife , i 'm a mother , i 'm a @entity10 and i 'm an @entity153			0
' " in a sign of the pressures to come , however , @entity9 was quickly drawn into the recent controversy over whether @entity157 house majority whip @entity157 should remain in leadership after it was revealed that he spoke to a white supremacist group in 2002			0
@entity9 stood by him in her brief appearance on @entity164 's " @entity163			1
" " there 's one quality he has that i think is very important in leadership and that 's humility , " she said			1
" and he 's actually shown that in this case			1
" at the same time , she also drew notice by joining the @entity172 this week , raising the eyebrows of its many @entity175 members by saying she wants to change it from the inside			2
" i think it 's important to join and do what you can to make sure we are uniting @entity153 , " @entity9 told @entity51 host @entity179 thursday			2
" i do n't want this divisiveness based on race or gender			0
" when it comes to models for freshmen lawmakers , strategists often cite @entity193 sen. @entity192 , the former comedian and ' @entity196 ' writer , and former @entity198 sen. @entity197 as two who figured out a formula and stuck to it			0
during his first term in the @entity17 , @entity192 often refused national media interviews — even quick asides in the hallway — trying to make his mark by plowing into policy issues like net neutrality and mobile privacy			0
as the former first lady , @entity211 's office was flooded with requests from national and international press during her first year in the @entity17			2
but " she declined 99.9 % of those interview requests , " said @entity215 , a long time adviser to @entity211 who was her chief of staff on her first @entity17 campaign			0
@entity211 tried instead to master local issues in granular detail , focusing on initiatives like getting @entity198 into the @entity223 , addressing the economic divide between @entity225 and @entity226 , and championing the state 's wine industry			2
( at a " @entity229 " hosted by @entity211 in the @entity17 , she placed @entity232 's @entity231 's @entity230 next to @entity198 winemakers , inspiring wine - flavored ice cream that is now sold internationally )			2
" she really did have tunnel vision on what the job was , and what she needed to do , " said @entity215			0
" she spent a lot of time on the minutia and the nitty - gritty			0
" @entity211 also knew her constituents had little patience for the media circus that surrounded her , @entity215 added			0
to that end , she initially tried to fly under the radar , spending much of her time on constituent work , and making it clear that she knew her place as the junior senator — standing behind @entity198 sen. @entity253 at the podium , for example , and waiting her turn to speak			0
others who came to the @entity17 as big names like @entity260 sen. @entity259 are still struggling to find the right balance			0
@entity259 's superhero acts as mayor of @entity264 -- rescuing a neighbor from a burning house and routinely helping stranded constituents shovel out of the snow -- inspired a faux - jealous video spoof by @entity260 gov. @entity270 , as well as an enormous @entity271 following			2
but while running for re-election to the @entity17 this fall , @entity259 told @entity273 that his goal for the year was to " stay away from the media " and " earn the respect of my colleagues " as a hard worker			0
@entity7 and @entity9 will face many of those kinds of decisions as they try to prove themselves on the national stage			1
" they 're both going to get an enormous amount of requests , not only for interviews , but also to travel and raise money for their respective parties and caucuses , " @entity215 said			0
' they are going to have to think hard about how to balance all that			0
" to nurture their careers over the long term , she recommended following what she called ' the @entity197 model ' : " @entity300 ; keep your eyes and ears open ; figure out how the place works and then do your best to provide for your constituents			0

@entity7 keeps a low *profile* in first week in @entity1
a test for @entity1 's new stars : balancing fame and overexposure
