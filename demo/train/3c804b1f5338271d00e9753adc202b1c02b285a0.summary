-- @entity1 was the woman to beat in track and field 's 400 - meter hurdles for nearly a decade , only to suffer crushing disappointment as a string of injuries wrecked her chances of @entity10 gold			1
it must have been tempting to step out of the sporting limelight -- but @entity1 did exactly the opposite			1
instead she took up the white knuckle sport of bobsleigh , and is making @entity10 history in @entity17 by becoming the first @entity19 woman to compete in both the @entity20 and now @entity21			1
less than 18 months after her first " terrifying " run on an ice course , @entity1 says she is " extraordinarily lucky " to be part of a team in the two - woman event with experienced driver @entity27			1
despite being hampered by a lack of funding , and having to replicate the all - important start in bobsleigh by pushing a converted supermarket trolley around her local running track , @entity1 is relishing the new challenge after the end of her athletics career			1
" i was n't quite sure what sport , so i pretty much tried everything , " she tells @entity0 's human to @entity39			0
" i tried rowing , i tried boxing and then i got a wonderful call from @entity45 to say would i be interested in trying to do bobsled , and pretty much it went from there			0
" a world champion on the track in 2003 and 2007 , @entity1 carried the hopes of all @entity19 going into the @entity53 and @entity54 @entity52 the following years -- only for her dreams to be shattered			1
the final blow came during 2012 when injury again scuppered her chances of competing in the @entity52			0
the 31 - year - old went into this month 's @entity60 with a realistic view of her chances , free from the previous pressure of expectation			2
" i think i want to stop and smell the roses			0
to actually feel what the spirit of the @entity67 is like , " she says			0
" other times it sped past with huge expectations on results			0
this time i got to share it with my friend @entity74 and to be part of a small but successful @entity19 team			1
" it has been wonderful			0
better than expected , i think this time around i get to really take it in and appreciate the moment			2
" not that the competitive fire which spurred on @entity1 as she dominated her discipline on the track was ever extinguished			1
she put herself through a rigorous training regime and bulked up , adding over 10 kg in weight from her hurdling days			0
" in an ideal world in bobsled , you want two massive women			2
this is the sport where everybody gets happy if you 've put on a kilo , rather than " oooh i 've lost a bit of weight ! " she explains			0
" it 's all about power and speed			0
you have to run 15 meters , 20 , sometimes 30 meters , jump in the sled , and the start really sets you up for the whole run down to the bottom			0
" so coming from a track and field background meant i 'd lifted weights since i was 15 and i had a very natural running technique behind the sled			1
" but despite her physical advantages , @entity1 also had to adapt her mindset to cope with the fear factor of racing down a icy course at over 140 kph ( 85 mph ) , tucked in as brakeman behind her driver @entity27			1
" you might be a great athlete , you might be able to do this , but you never know if you 're actually going to be able to overcome that fear and terror at the top of the hill , " she admits			0
" really , it just feels like a giant washing machine			0
i started at one of the hardest tracks in the world so it was pretty much the rollercoaster ride of your life			2
" that initial training run at @entity128 in @entity129 was a case of being thrown in at the deep end , but she quickly adapted			0
" @entity45 was very clever in the fact that she made sure i had to do three runs on my first day because i got out of the first sled and was like , ' i 'm going home ! this is horrible ! ' but by the time i went down on the third go , i was absolutely hooked			2
" the pair had immediate success and took seventh place in a @entity143 event on the same track , the best on record by an @entity19 team			1
they were 14th after tuesday 's opening heats in @entity17 , and maintained that placing in wednesday 's final two			0
@entity27 has been to the @entity152 , @entity153 and now @entity60 , competing in the sport for 11 years , but coming from nation like @entity19 , with little history in bobsleigh , the lack of funding has been a challenge			1
" bobsleigh is like @entity160 and it costs a lot of money to have fast equipment , " @entity27 , also 31 , tells @entity0			1
" so like a @entity160 team , if you do n't have a lot of money to invest in it , it is hard to do well , which has made it hard for us			0
" the addition of @entity1 has helped raise funds , reaching a target of $ @entity174 , 000 ( $ 18,000 ) to help buy a new sled			1
sponsors were invited to support the " @entity177 " -- which is the nickname the team adopted for branding and publicity purposes			0
" @entity45 advertised on our @entity183 page , " @entity1 says			1
" a little competition on names and then people voted			0
it gave us an identity a team name , so certainly helped with our support			0
" @entity1 said they had also resorted to some unusual training methods in the quest for success			1
" we push shopping trolleys in our backyard , we train at a normal athletics track because we do n't have snow and we do n't have ice , so for @entity19 to make the @entity52 in bobsled is pretty much a ' @entity202 ' all over again , " she says			1
that @entity204 film about the @entity206 bobsleigh team in the 1988 @entity21 in @entity207 may well act as an inspiration , but during her storied career in track and field , @entity1 was rarely the underdog			1
already a world youth champion , she went to her first olympics on home soil in @entity216 in 2000 and won @entity67 gold two years later in @entity218			2
then came world championship success in @entity220 but in the buildup to @entity53 she picked up a knee injury that required surgery just before the @entity67			2
despite the disadvantage , she still managed a creditable fifth place in the final , although that was little consolation at the time			2
further @entity67 success in @entity230 in 2006 was tempered during the course of the year by a very public row with 4x400m relay teammate @entity233 , which led to adverse publicity for both athletes			0
@entity1 was reportedly ready to leave @entity19 and by then she was married to @entity238 's former champion hurdler @entity237 , giving birth to their son @entity240 later that year			1
relenting on the threat -- " i 've always been a very proud @entity19 " -- and coached by @entity237 , @entity1 dominated the 400m hurdles in 2007 and won her second world title in @entity244			1
however , injuries again took their toll on her @entity10 hopes , and her relationship with @entity237 also soured			2
after a brief reconciliation they have separated again , leaving @entity1 to face life as a working mother			2
" i 'm studying medicine full - time and i have a little boy who is seven , but for me , having him in my life is so grounding and i feel like i have a very full , loved life so i will certainly not go to my grave with any fears or regrets , " she says			1
that also extends to her track and field career , despite missing out on her ultimate goals			2
" i 've been very lucky that i 've been to two @entity10 and won two senior world titles , so it 's certainly been a wonderful career and i 'm very grateful for the opportunity			1
" @entity1 also has no intention of fading quietly into retirement @entity269 , and wants to maintain her partnership with @entity27 on the @entity143 bobsleigh circuit			1
" i know that @entity45 wants to retire but i 'm still trying to get her to go another year , " she says			0
" i 've really found something that i love in bobsleigh			0
it is a great sport , the people in this sport , even from other countries , are really together , they really help you on every possible angle and i think i 'd love to stay in this sport if possible			0
" failing that , @entity1 has also hinted at a return to track and field -- although she would have to shed the extra muscle that is such an asset in bobsleigh to be competitive in running events			1
that would appear not to offer much of an obstacle for a young woman who is renowned for being singleminded with athletic excellence in mind			2
in 2010 she caused a stir by revealing that she had undergone surgery to remove breast implants , feeling they were affecting her performance on the track			0
" every time i raced i panicked about whether i was letting my country down , all for my own vanity , " she was quoted as saying at the time			0
" i do n't want to short - change @entity19 either			1
" after her heroic efforts to reach the @entity52 in an entirely new sport , that 's certainly not something @entity1 could ever be accused of			2
" it was lovely to have the support of the public , they helped get us our new sled and really got behind us all year , " she says with pride .			0
