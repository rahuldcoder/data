-- moms and dads : get your kids to take you to see " the @entity6 " this weekend ! that seems to be the message from the nation 's movie critics , who have uniformly crowned this @entity13 toy story the brilliant hybrid offspring of @entity15 's best infused with " @entity17 's " irreverent humor			1
based on the ubiquitous lock - block toy and licensed with many of pop - culture 's most ubiquitous heroes , " the @entity6 " is a sly trojan horse of a movie			1
" using the building - block world of @entity26 to parody the creeping conformity of our world , ' the @entity6 ' proves even more biting than ' @entity30 , ' because it has the sauciness to send up its own rise - of - a - hero story line , " writes @entity0 's @entity24			1
@entity0 review : ' the @entity6 ' " @entity35 's " @entity34 voices @entity36 , a typical @entity26 drone who accidentally stumbles upon a @entity26 piece that makes a band of @entity42 - like revolutionaries think he 's the @entity44 , the one who can save their world from the fascist president business ( @entity48 )			1
@entity36 has some high - profile allies , including @entity50 ( @entity51 ) , @entity52 ( @entity53 ) , @entity54 ( @entity55 ) , @entity56 ( @entity57 ) , and @entity58 , as well as the beautiful rebel @entity6 ( @entity59 ) and the sage mystic @entity62 ( @entity61 )			1
written and directed by @entity63 and @entity63 , the duo behind the first " @entity64 " and " @entity65 , " " the @entity6 " is a clever combination of stop - motion animation and ingenuous @entity69 effects — fire , water — all made to resemble stop - motion			1
toss in the ironic @entity75 anthem to conformity , " @entity77 , " and your inner - nerd child has plenty to play with			2
before you head to the theaters , read what some of the nation 's top critics are saying about " the @entity6			1
" ( or just go see it before they hype it beyond realistic expectations			0
) @entity24 ( @entity0 ) ▲ " it may be a helter - skelter kiddie adventure built out of plastic toy components , but it 's fast and original , it 's conceptually audacious , it 's visually astonishing , and it 's 10 times more clever and smart and funny than it needed to be			2
here , at last , is an animated comedy that never stops surprising you			0
" @entity97 ( @entity98 ) " the overt message is that you should throw out the manuals and follow the lead of your own ingenuity , improvising new combinations for the building blocks in front of you			0
but the movie itself follows a fairly strict and careful formula , thwarting its inventive potential in favor of the expected and familiar			2
" ' the @entity6 ' could be 2014 's first big ' block'buster @entity111 ( @entity112 ) " filled with humor and action , the @entity114 movie pulls off an emotional finish that rivals some of @entity15 's best work			1
you can argue — and not sound completely crazy — that this is a better film than a few recent @entity122 best picture nominees			0
" @entity123 ( @entity124 — vulture ) ▲ " ' the @entity6 ' is the kind of animated free - for - all that comes around very rarely , if ever : a kids ' movie that matches shameless fun with razor - sharp wit , that offers up a spectacle of pure , freewheeling joy even as it tackles the thorniest of issues			1
it 's part ' @entity17 , ' part ' @entity137 ' ; part ' @entity42 , ' part ' idiocracy			1
' " @entity139 ( @entity140 ) ▲ " the keys to the movie 's absurdly high enjoyment factor are its exuberance , timing , wit and willingness to stoop to its source — or kneel on the carpet looking for lost bricks , as the case may be			2
unlike ' battleship , ' ' @entity153 , ' and the dreaded ' @entity155 , ' the @entity6 ' is rooted in the wonky hobbyist esthetic of the @entity26 system itself			1
" @entity158 ( @entity159 ) " the movie 's secret weapon is the vividly detailed world @entity63 and @entity63 have created for their characters , stuffing the screen with so many visual puns and easter eggs , you often want to hit the pause button to take it all in			2
" @entity169 ( @entity170 ) ▲ " if you 're wondering if the film plays like a 90 - plus - minute commercial , strangely it does not			0
there is a very familiar feel to the film , which remains true to the style of those ubiquitous bits and pieces that are everywhere			0
at the same time , ' the @entity6 ' is strikingly , exhilaratingly , exhaustingly fresh			1
" ' the @entity6 ' trailer : ' come with me if you wan na not die ' @entity184 ( salon ) " even in delivering the message that lord business ' fetish for order is not the true way of @entity26 , there are limits			1
@entity26 long ago forged corporate partnerships with @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity114 and so on , and those interests are protected			0
" @entity199 ( @entity200 ) ▲ " no question that the movie promotes what @entity203 would call a subversive message : be creative with your toys			0
it also urges kids to venture out of the virtual world they live in and use their hands for something other than typing			0
" @entity213 ( @entity214 ) ▲ " the film functions as a massive homage to a shared childhood experience , amplified and projected on the big screen			0
so , while the result is undoubtedly the single most product - centric film of all time , it 's also just hip and irreverent enough to leave audiences feeling as though its makers managed to pull one over on the business guys			0
" @entity228 ( @entity229 ) ▲ " ' the @entity6 ' pokes fun at anyone who would argue that @entity26 products are , as one character puts it , ' a highly sophisticated , interlocking brick system , ' and not simply toys			2
but it also makes fun of itself , tweaking the conventions of narrative filmmaking , animation and @entity26 model - making itself			0
