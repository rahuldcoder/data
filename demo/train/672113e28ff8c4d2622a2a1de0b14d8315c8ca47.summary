-- i remember driving in eastern @entity2 one winter following my brother home on an hour - long trip			2
it had snowed earlier that morning , and by the time we got on the road the plows still had n't reached the back roads we were on			0
i was driving a front - wheel drive @entity11 with all - season tires while he had a @entity15 with the proper tires for the road conditions			1
the idea was that he 'd plow me a path to drive through as best as he could			2
we were just asking for something to go wrong			0
not even a half hour into the drive home , i came around a corner too fast , briefly lost control and steered myself right into the front yard of a farmhouse			2
luckily i did n't hurt myself or anyone else , but that day i learned what it meant not to have proper traction for the road conditions			0
recently , i talked with @entity32 from @entity33 to learn about the differences between all - season tires and winter tires along with the basics to consider when purchasing a set of tires designed for the harsh winter conditions			1
@entity41 vs. @entity42 @entity32 explained that all - season tires are a jack - of - all - trades but master of none			1
" all - season tires are n't really tuned for any one area , and suffer from not being optimum for any one area because it is compromised to be capable in all areas , " he said			1
he explained that winter tires ( they 're just not for the snow ) focus their attention on the exact conditions you 'll most likely be facing during the winter season			1
" they key of a true winter tire 's capability is that you have a specialist , he said			0
" a product that is designed to work the best in the cooler winter season temperatures , say below 45 degrees , a tread pattern and tread compound that are designed to take bites out of the snow and work well on packed snow and ice ; something that an all - season tired just is n't optimized to do			1
" he explained that today 's winter tires have come a long way : " they go beyond the deep aggressive lug ' snow ' tire that many of our parents put on the back of family station wagon			1
" @entity32 said today 's winter tires are available for certain conditions or are ideal for a particular region of the county			2
it 's best to determine what conditions you 'll be driving in and then determine the type of winter tire you will need			0
@entity32 said it 's a good idea to talk with a local retailer or do some personal investigating to choose which tire has the right characteristics for your location			0
" the typical image [ of a snow tire ] is that very aggressive , knobby zig - zag tread pattern that is n't far removed from the farm implement tire or a piece of off road construction equipment tire , " he said			1
" no longer is that loud knobby , gnarly off - road style tread pattern required to provide good traction on snow , slush and ice			1
" what to look for when buying when looking for true winter tire , @entity32 recommends using the @entity117 and @entity119 's standard symbol of the snowflake - on - the - mountain			0
only tires that are tested in packed snow and exceed other reference tires by 10 % are given the industry standard symbol			1
the presence of that symbol is typically a good indication of a true winter tire			0
some tires barely meet the requirement and still have the symbol			0
@entity32 said it 's best to look for dedicated winter tires in addition to looking for the snowflake symbol			0
" the industry really intended that symbol to be a merit badge for true winter tires , not for a multi purpose or multi use tires like on - / off - road all terrain or highway all - season , " he said			1
" i do n't think we 're going to see many more or many new non-winter tires coming out with the snowflake - on - the - mountain symbol			1
" he said presently there 's no comparison between a winter tire with the snowflake symbol and an - all season tire without one			2
" the symbol does n't distinguish between the two , not yet , " he said			0
" the industry is talking about some type of grading scale			0
we 're encouraging them to have multiple snowflakes or a 1 - 2 - 3 scale			0
something that gives the consumer a real idea of how good a winter performer the tire really is			0
" @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 it seems as if there are more all - wheel drive cars and suvs than ever , and even if you do n't have those features , an increasing number of cars have some sort of traction control			1
so why the need for winter tires when our cars can do so much work for us ? " the winter tire really helps you get the most out of those safety features that are built into your car , " @entity32 said			2
" these electronic systems are only as capable as the traction that 's provided to them by the tires , because the tires are the only thing connected to the ground			0
" he said the all - wheel drive capability gives @entity168 owners driving on all - season tires a false sense of security			1
while they 'll be able to accelerate better than @entity202 vehicles in wintry conditions , they do n't have an advantage when it comes to stopping or turning in those conditions			0
" ultimately , how quickly you can stop or how sharply you can turn on the snow or on the ice is determined by the grip that your tires provide , " @entity32 noted			2
@entity32 uses snow tires on both his 2wd @entity214 pickup and his @entity215 and says that he can accelerate better with his two - wheel drive vehicles with snow tires than @entity218 with all season tires			1
" and i know i can stop better than they can , and turn better than they can , " he added			0
two tires or four ? @entity32 recommends putting four winter tires on your vehicle , even if your vehicle is two - wheel drive			1
" today 's tires offer significant traction on snow and on ice , more than even good all season tires do , " he said			1
" and , because of that , our testing has shown and the industry testing has shown that the mix of two winter tires and two all season tires is a very dangerous combination			1
it may seem like you are spending an extra few hundred dollars to buy two more tires , but i can assure you it 's less than the deductible on your insurance once you have a wreck			0
" he has a separate set of tires for most of his family cars so that he can change them over easily in his own garage before a snowstorm comes			0
if you 're considering purchasing a set of winter tires and rims , @entity32 said that @entity33 and other retailers generally will do the tire and wheel mount and balance for no additional cost when you purchase certain packages			2
" once you drive in the snow on a modern winter tire , you 'll never want to do anything else			2
i find that 's it 's much more like driving in the rain than driving in the snow , " @entity32 said			0
" i 'm no longer clenching the wheel , holding on and hoping , i just drive around			2
the difference is stunning , when you 're driving in 3 - 6 inches of snow and they have n't plowed the roads , you just go			2
and that 's even in a two wheel drive vehicle , " he said			1
" when you drive an all wheel drive or @entity168 with winter tires , it 's virtually unstoppable			1

snow tires really are better than all - season tires in snowy areas
all - wheel drive can give @entity168 owners false sense of security
get snow tires for all four wheels , even if car is two - wheel drive
