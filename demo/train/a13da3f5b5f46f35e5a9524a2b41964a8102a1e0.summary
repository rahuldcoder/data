-- the death of more than 300 @entity3 migrants in a shipwreck off the @entity6 island of @entity7 in early october has shone a spotlight on illegal immigration to @entity10			2
but although the tragedy at @entity7 shocked the world , it has done little to dissuade migrants who continue to make the perilous journey across the @entity16 from northern @entity3 to @entity10 shores			2
@entity18 , the @entity20 border agency , says the majority of people residing illegally in the @entity20 arrived by plane with a valid travel visa and simply stayed on after their visa expired			1
but @entity18 also estimates that at least 72,000 people illegally entered the @entity20 via land and sea routes in 2012 -- and the actual figure may be much higher			1
according to @entity18 's " @entity30 " report , 51 % of migrants entering illegally via land and sea took an eastern @entity16 route , with many crossing into @entity37 before continuing on to the western @entity38 by land or through ferry links to @entity6			1
opinion : @entity10 's immigration nightmare just beginning while detections of illegal border crossings dropped in the western @entity16 area between northern @entity3 and @entity46 , attempted migrant incursions through the central @entity16 region -- including @entity6 -- are up in 2012 , according to the report			1
many of the migrants are fleeing violence and poverty in places like @entity55 and @entity56			0
the deaths of hundreds of migrants in early october has prompted @entity20 leaders to review the bloc 's immigration policies			0
opinion : @entity20 must solve crisis to deserve @entity63 the @entity20 's commissioner for home affairs , @entity64 , issued a statement in early october calling on @entity10 nations to give @entity18 the resources to mount " a wide @entity18 search and rescue operation in the @entity16 , from @entity70 to @entity46			2
" the @entity20 also said it is setting up a new border surveillance system and @entity16 task force to bolster its efforts and will review its asylum immigration policies next summer			0
opinion : what 's the place of outsiders in @entity10 ? but in the meantime , observers do n't expect any let - up in migrant boats attempting to reach the shores of southern @entity10			0
