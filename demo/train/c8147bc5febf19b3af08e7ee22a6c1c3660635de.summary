the official was not authorized to speak publicly and is not being named by @entity0			0

@entity75 , who 's 33 years old , has been involved in fighting in @entity85 and @entity20 , he said			0
@entity5 braces for reprisals there are fears the killing of @entity6 may spark a surge in violence			2
this is in part because the attack in @entity20 in 2009 -- in which seven @entity2 citizens died -- was launched in response to the strike that killed @entity84 four months earlier			1
the @entity98 , designated by the @entity2 as a terrorist organization , vowed to avenge @entity101 's death			2

this is not the first time @entity6 -- who took the reins of the @entity5 @entity7 in 2009 -- has been reported killed after a drone strike			1
in february 2010 , multiple sources said he had died after being hit in a drone strike in @entity5 a month earlier			1
but reports that he was alive surfaced in april of that year , and in may 2010 he appeared in a video in which he vowed attacks on major @entity2 cities			2
the fact that senior @entity5 government officials have commented so quickly on the news of his death this time adds credence to the reports			2
@entity5 @entity7 claimed @entity24 plot the @entity5 @entity7 , which has long been conducting an insurgency against the @entity5 government , claimed responsibility for the december 2009 suicide bombing at the @entity2 ' @entity164 in @entity165 , @entity20			1

@entity6 took over from @entity84 , a fellow clan member , in 2009 after the latter was killed in a @entity2 drone strike			1
peace prospects @entity6 's death could make progress in proposed peace talks between the @entity5 government and @entity5 @entity7 more difficult			1
a relatively young and charismatic leader , he held together a disparate group with different tribal and other allegiances			0
there had reportedly been talks about him being involved in peace talks with @entity5 's government			1
his killing may upset some elements within the @entity5 @entity7 if they believe that the @entity5 government was involved			1
