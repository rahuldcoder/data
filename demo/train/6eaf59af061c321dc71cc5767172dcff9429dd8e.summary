-- recently , an organization called students for @entity1 filed a lawsuit against @entity5 , alleging that its admissions practices violate @entity7 of the @entity8 for " intentionally discriminating against applicants on the basis of race " -- specifically , against @entity12			1
( a second , similar lawsuit was filed against the @entity14 -- @entity15			1
) the lawsuit alleges that @entity5 has , through the use of " holistic " consideration of applicants , " systematically " excluded qualified @entity12 in favor of less qualified black and @entity22 applicants in an attempt to illegally achieve " racial balancing			1
" here 's the thing			2
this lawsuit -- and the organization that filed it -- is not the affirmative action crusade it may seem , and i will get to that in a minute			1
as an @entity12 graduate of @entity5 , i read this news with dismay , both because i share a lot in common with the plaintiff at the core of the suit -- let 's call her @entity40 -- and because my personal experience has been so fundamentally different			1
you see , both she and i are second - generation @entity12 , the children of immigrants who saw preparing us for higher education as their fundamental responsibility			1
it 's a common running joke among second - generation @entity12 that our parents start us on college prep before we begin potty training			1
the joke did n't seem so funny to me when i was a kid , however			2
i remember earning minutes of tv by defining vocabulary words correctly -- while i was still in 4th grade			2
i remember being rewarded for finishing homework early by getting extra " @entity59 , " which always involved problem sets and practice exams from a dog - eared stack of @entity64 test prep tomes			0
i did n't remember being dressed in a crimson - colored onesie while still an infant , but my mother showed me the one she 'd bought for me , proudly pulling it from storage on the day i headed out to college			2
that 's because to my parents , it was n't enough for me to just go to college			2
there was only one school they saw as a fitting goal , and it was the reason they came to @entity81 , my mother said , hoping that one day they would have kids who would grow up to attend it			0
that was @entity5 , the only school whose brand name shone brightly enough to reach across the waters to @entity89			1
other schools might offer a more dynamic curriculum , better access to senior faculty , a greater amount of financial aid			0
to them , it was @entity100 or bust			0
as it turns out , i did get into @entity5			1
and two years later , so did my sister			0
and her part - time undergraduate job at the @entity5 admissions office ended up leading us to a few awkward revelations			1
you see , in the course of her job , she was able to gain access to college admissions files , and could n't resist pulling her own to see what it said			2
the file told her bluntly that she had been a " marginal " admit based on her application , but that she was ultimately accepted because she had a brother who was already a student in good standing â € ” that is to say , me			0
incensed , she then pulled my file to see whether i had gotten in on my own merits			0
and what she shared with me was the discovery that i essentially would have been denied admission , based on scores and grades that were somewhat lower than hers , and an all - too - typical extracurricular career ( piano , math team , blah blah blah )			0
what saved my application was the optional interview i 'd done on campus , in which i 'd ended up talking about everything that was n't in my application : my aspirations to be a writer			2
the horror movie that i 'd scripted and shot in secret at our high school			0
the subtle differences between anxiety , suspense and fear			0
the fact that i actually really , really suck at piano			0
the interviewer made the case that i had intangibles that made me a potential asset to the student body , and pressed for me to be considered seriously , despite my middling distinction			0
someone decided to take his advice			0
i hope they did n't end up regretting it			2
now , let 's go back to @entity40			0
she did n't end up at the center of the @entity5 suit accidentally			1
she was discovered through a broad - based campaign conducted by @entity168 founder @entity167 â € ” a frustrated @entity170 congressional candidate who has chosen to make a career out of waging war on laws and policies that give " special privileges " to minorities			0
@entity40 was someone @entity167 wanted -- a student willing to serve as a test case in a high - profile attack on affirmative action			1
it 's important to note that whatever its outcome , the lawsuit wo n't help @entity40			1
it 's almost certain that she 's been accepted by other colleges , and by the time the suit is resolved she will likely have graduated from one of them			0
what this lawsuit is really is just the latest attempt to derail an apparatus that has given hundreds of thousands of blacks , @entity22 and , yes , @entity192 a means to climb out of circumstances defined by our society 's historical racism			1
it is hardly a coincidence that @entity167 has chosen to use the @entity12 community as his tool to do so			1
there are millions of @entity192 who , like my parents , see a prestigious - university education as not just a goal for their children but a virtual entitlement , the product of years of aspiration and preparation			0
but there are millions of other @entity12 -- a significant majority , in fact , at 69 % -- who support affirmative action as a necessary way for us to achieve a better society , and who recognize that we have benefited and continue to benefit from its fruits , both directly and indirectly			1
as @entity224 assistant professor of higher education @entity222 puts it , " the question @entity12 face now is , ' do we care about justice or just us ? ' " she adds , " if we care about justice , we have to see that we 're only being used as cover to dismantle a policy initiative that is about racial equity , which ultimately benefits everyone			1
" and then there 's the reality that my sister and i experienced personally -- which is that getting into college is about more than just scores			0
despite all of my parents ' drills and test prep , i was ultimately accepted into @entity5 only due to the very " holistic " practices that this lawsuit attacks			1
my sister , meanwhile , was pushed over the line due to her connection to me , a " secondary legacy " tie that , based on the research of @entity5 researcher @entity250 , might have conveyed as much as a 19 % boost over other applicants , given her profile			1
meanwhile , my kids -- " primary legacy " candidates -- will have up to a 50 % greater chance of getting in , for no reason other than being born			0
that 's great for them , should they choose to apply to my alma mater , but it 's a huge obstacle to overcome for those who do n't have that advantage			2
it amounts to what @entity266 , a senior fellow at the @entity267 , calls " affirmative action for the rich			1
" and it locks out the vast majority of blacks , hispanics and immigrants of every race			0
is n't that the real outrage ?			2

a lawsuit was filed against @entity5 alleging discrimination against @entity12
@entity283 : this lawsuit is not the affirmative action crusade it may seem
his experience in applying to @entity5 *suggests* a " holistic " approach makes sense
@entity283 : do n't let this lawsuit derail affirmative action , which has benefited many
