the crisis in @entity1 took on a decidedly military flavor friday as tensions flared between @entity16 and @entity17 over control of @entity12 , even as the world 's diplomats said conflict could be avoided			1
@entity12 , a self - governing peninsula in southern @entity1 with an ethnic @entity7 majority and strong cultural ties to @entity7 , has become the epicenter of a battle for influence between @entity16 , @entity17 and the @entity27 since @entity1 president @entity28 was pushed out of office by protesters who were angered over his rebuff of a trade deal with the @entity33 in favor of one with @entity7			1
in the days since @entity28 was ousted , thousands of @entity7 troops have surrounded military bases and key infrastructure sites , and they have taken control of border crossings			2
at the same time , a political battle has been playing out between the two countries , with @entity7 's @entity42 on friday giving its defiant support to @entity45 lawmakers who want to see their region split from @entity1 and join @entity7			1

" i want to warn separatists and other traitors of the @entity1 state who are trying to work against @entity1 , any of your decisions taken is unlawful , unconstitutional , and nobody in the civilized world is going to recognize the results of the so - called referendum of the so - called @entity45 authorities , " he said friday			1
@entity7 has denounced @entity28 's ouster as an illegitimate coup , and @entity7 president @entity91 has refused to recognize the new @entity1 authorities			1
@entity91 has insisted he has the right to use military force in @entity1 if necessary to protect ethnic @entity7 in @entity12			1
but @entity1 officials say no threat exists , and @entity91 is using it as a pretext to control the region			2
map : how @entity1 is divided @entity55 president @entity102 set out a potential solution to the crisis when he spoke to @entity91 on thursday , the @entity101 said			2

@entity45 threat ? what has mostly been a peaceful standoff in @entity12 , with virtually no sign of @entity1 military movement , appeared to take a turn on friday when pro-russian forces smashed open the gates of a @entity1 base near @entity0 that controls airspace in southern @entity1 , @entity115 , a deputy commander at the base , told @entity2			1

the journalist told @entity2 he was wrestled to the ground , and a gun was put to his head			0
the incident was captured on surveillance footage and aired on a @entity1 tv channel , @entity196			0
