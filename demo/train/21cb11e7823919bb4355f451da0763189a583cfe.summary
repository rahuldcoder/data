-- during the days leading up to the 20th anniversary of the release of @entity5 's landmark album " nevermind " on saturday and the grunge album 's deluxe reissue the following tuesday , you 're going to hear a lot about how " nevermind " changed everything : how the band 's single , " @entity13 , " was a phenomenal , seemingly overnight success that ushered so - called alternative rock into the mainstream			1
how " @entity20 " killed hair metal and unseated @entity16 -- the old guard -- from the top of the @entity19 album chart			2
how the success of " @entity20 " ignited a major - label feeding frenzy to find " the next @entity5 , " resulting in the signing of previously way - too - weird - for - a - major - label bands such as underground heroes @entity27 and @entity29 noise - rockers the @entity26			0
how most of these groups were unceremoniously dropped when they did n't sell boatloads of records , while groups perceived by many to be @entity5 and / or @entity37 ripoffs ( i.e. : @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 ) achieved multiplatinum success			0
how @entity42 gave voice to a disaffected , flannel - clad @entity44 and how @entity42 was a musical genius , gone from this @entity46 too soon			0
and all of these things are true , aside from the hair - metal myth ( glam - metal was already a genre in decline by that point )			0
you 'll also be hearing a lot of use of the word " grunge , " a label used -- typically to the labeled party 's chagrin -- to describe purveyors of the raw fusion of heavy metal and punk rock that emerged from the @entity65			1
but what you wo n't hear quite so much are the specifics of that emergence			0
in some quarters , it seems 1991 , which also saw the release of @entity37 's multiplatinum debut album " ten " and @entity75 's " @entity74 , " is being treated as year 0 of grunge , because that 's when the music exploded into the mainstream consciousness			1
in fact , grunge 's roots can be traced back to the 1980s , if not further			1
" @entity85 , " the 1986 compilation on @entity89 label @entity87 , is recognized as the first record to document this burgeoning regional sound			1
it featured a half - dozen local bands : @entity75 , @entity92 , the @entity93 , @entity94 , the @entity95 and @entity96			1
none of those groups is a household name , save for @entity75 , which scored a no. 1 hit with the album " @entity102 " in 1994 and just this year embarked on a @entity104 reunion tour after more than a decade apart			0
but if you want to know how @entity5 and @entity37 came to be , these six bands -- whose histories are tightly intertwined -- are a good place to start			0
@entity96 's guitarist , @entity110 , produced @entity5 's the down - tuned and scuzzy debut album , " @entity112			1
" members of @entity92 , often cited as the first grunge band , went on to form @entity37 and quintessential grunge rockers @entity116			1
the @entity93 , who have essentially never stopped touring or recording with 20 studio albums to their name , were friends and mentors to @entity5 's @entity42 and @entity123 , who hailed from the same rural part of @entity125			2
as @entity123 once said of the sway @entity93 frontman @entity126 held over him : " @entity128 was the preacher , and his gospel was punk rock			0
" the @entity93 sonic influence on @entity5 's first album is unmistakable			2
but to hear @entity126 tell it , his band 's importance has too often been diminished			1
" all ( @entity5 ) biographers want to do is pretend that we do n't matter , " the never - shy singer / guitarist said to me at the onset of the first interview i conducted with him for my book			0
" they talk us down like none of this makes any difference , but what they have to understand , and what needs to be clearly stated , is that without us , there is no @entity5			0
without us , there is no @entity5			0
" so by all means go ahead and purchase the " @entity20 " reissue or catch a showing of @entity160 's new " @entity161 " documentary , and relive the glories of grunge 's most commercial era			1
but if you want a deeper understanding of where grunge came from , investigate some music by the @entity93 ( those @entity5 biographers be damned ! ) or @entity116 or any number of other grunge bands not fronted by someone with the surname @entity42 , @entity173 or @entity174			2
yes , 1991 was a very good year for grunge , but why not try something of a different vintage ?			2
