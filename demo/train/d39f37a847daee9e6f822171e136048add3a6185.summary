-- what if you found yourself stuck alone at a faraway airport -- with no money , credit cards or @entity6 ? how easily could you fly back home again ? you might survive if you had a smartphone			1
emerging " empty pockets " technology is increasingly allowing travelers to use their phones to make purchases , book flights , check in and board planes			1
wallets ? they 're so 2008			0
@entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 are already big into electronic boarding passes on smartphones , and stragglers like @entity24 are planning e-boarding programs in the near future			2
what 's next ? if some visionaries have their way , the future of mobile travel will touch virtually every key activity at the airport -- including security and @entity19 passports			1
smartphone technology might improve airport efficiency and help ease the pain from skyrocketing traffic predicted in the next 20 years			1
but is a post- 9/11 world comfortable with the idea of merging personal cell phones into the airport security network ? @entity44 -- still basking in the afterglow of last week 's @entity47 curtain raiser -- is also unveiling @entity48 , an app which organizes e-boarding passes , flight reservations , coupons and other documents			1
but @entity44 has a much more grandiose plan for its empty pocket dreams , according to public @entity57 documents			1
read the patent document ( @entity59 )			2
for example , imagine checking bags with your cell phone -- or passing through security by flashing an official driver 's license or @entity19 passport displayed on your phone			2
outside the airport , envision using just your phone to rent a car or to check into a hotel			2
how about using your phone as an electronic hotel room key ? but let 's get real , say industry experts and government officials			2
as cool as all these ideas sound , extending @entity44 's technology and influence to airport baggage tracking and @entity81 security would be unprecedented			1
" i 'm always kind of staggered by the scale and complexity and the ambition that they have , " says mobile phone industry analyst @entity82 of @entity84			2
as you might expect from the secretive folks at @entity44 , they would n't talk to @entity0 about the patent documents			1
but we did grab some time with " @entity96 " reporter @entity95 , who covers nothing but @entity44 , including its patents for future products			1
" @entity100 may be the biggest issue , " says @entity95			0
carrying all your personal @entity6 and travel documents on a single device would be very tempting for skilled password hacks , says @entity95			2
related story : your smartphone will eventually be hacked the concept the 2008 patent application was approved in july and filed under the working title " @entity111			2
" @entity95 suspects the @entity111 concept will be folded into @entity44 's @entity48 app , which will be available for download on wednesday			1
right now , @entity48 will store electronic versions of airline boarding passes which will automatically pop up on @entity47 screens when you arrive at the airport			1
the phone knows where you are , thanks to geo - locator technology			2
that aspect alone will make a lot of gadget - geeky travelers feel all gee - whizzy inside			0
even more gee - whizzy : the patent calls for @entity128 to automatically check in luggage when passengers approach an airport baggage check - in kiosk			1
( see details in the photo gallery above			0
) would security benefit from smart - phone based e-passports and e-drivers licenses ? would they increase speed , efficiency or security at @entity81 check points ? currently -- as most of us know -- @entity81 agents briefly examine government @entity6 and boarding passes as each passenger presents their documents at a checkpoint at the end of a security line			2
related story : @entity44 's secrets are n't so secret anymore under @entity44 's patent , a traveler 's phone would automatically send electronic identification to a @entity81 agent as soon as the traveler gets in line			1
while each traveler waits in line , @entity81 agents would examine the electronic @entity6 at an electronic viewing station			2
next , at the x-ray stations , a traveler 's phone would confirm to security agents that the traveler 's @entity6 had already been checked			2
throughout the process , the phone photo could be displayed on a screen for comparison with the traveler			0
facial recognition software could be included in the process			0
( see details on @entity44 's proposal in the photo gallery above			1
) the patent documents offer a surprising number of details which open doors to key questions about the system , but @entity44 declined to discuss the patent			1
the @entity81 would n't comment either on the viability of @entity44 's plan			1
but other government officials , aviation authorities and longtime industry experts say @entity44 faces at least three high hurdles if they want to see this idea to fruition			1
verification several experts say a key question that must be answered is : how would you prove that the phone is yours ? in other words , how would you prove that the e-passport is actually you ? to get around this problem , future phones or electronic @entity6 may require some form of biometric security function -- like fingerprint matching			1
in general , passports must be designed to be difficult to copy			2
recent security changes to @entity19 passports have included a hidden radio frequency identification chip to hinder counterfeiters			1
the chip includes the same data as the paper passport , a unique chip id number , a digital version of the passport holder 's photo " which will facilitate the use of face recognition technology at ports - of - entry , " according to the @entity219 website			1
universality any company that intends to create an official electronic @entity6 will have to work closely with countless government authorities to come up with secure , verifiable standards			2
think about the complexity of that idea across 50 @entity19 states and all the nations that travelers visit each year			0
an electronic passport would have to be approved by an international standards organization , and it would have to be usable from country to country , according to the @entity219 , which oversees @entity19 passports			1
there are ongoing government efforts aimed at using technology to enhance passport security and convenience , according to a @entity219 official			1
but the @entity219 says a smartphone portable e-passport is unlikely to become a reality anytime soon			0
" we 're not at a point where the government is going to go digital for any of that stuff , " says @entity95 , of " @entity96			0
" then he laughs and says , " i mean , i 'm not even allowed to laminate my social security card			0
" related story : opinion : airport @entity249 and mobile services are lacking infrastructure @entity44 's patent calls for the placement of special kiosks around the airport which will automatically exchange data with your phone via a close range wireless technology called near field communication ( @entity262 )			1
@entity44 phones -- including the new @entity47 -- do n't include @entity262 , but they eventually would , according to the @entity111 patent			1
related story : @entity262 is n't ready for prime time if consumers , airlines , airports and the @entity81 do n't embrace the @entity262 kiosks , experts say it 's unlikely @entity44 's vision would become reality			1
" first you would have to sell industry on @entity44 's idea , says @entity95			1
" then you 'd have to sell it to travel consumers			0
" case in point : @entity283 , a mobile phone app which allows people to make purchases with their @entity262 - enabled android phones			1
you set it up by attaching your wallet account to your credit card			0
then , you wave your phone near a special @entity262 - enabled point - of - purchase terminal , and voila ! it 's paid for			0
most @entity295 taxis take @entity283			0
travelers using @entity297 can tap their wallet - enabled phones at the @entity300 rail station and at @entity295 's @entity301			0
many cabs in @entity303 also are wallet - friendly			0
also , using @entity283 will get you access to special discount offers			0
@entity306 is n't ruling out adding more travel features to wallet -- like e-boarding passes			0
" a wallet can hold all kinds of things , " hints @entity306 's @entity309			0
" things are absolutely in development			0
" a little more than a year after launching , @entity283 has about 200,000 @entity262 point of purchase terminals nationwide , according to @entity306			0
although the concept may be ahead of its time , analyst @entity82 says @entity283 remains less than successful because there simply are n't enough terminals			0
" they 're probably about three years premature , " @entity82 says			0
" it 's a chicken - and - egg problem , " says @entity95			0
" you need to have the @entity262 kiosks there and you need to be aware of it and the stores have to invest in it , so sometimes it just does n't catch on			0
" along with making a buck , @entity328 appears to be trying to make travel more convenient through smartphone technology			1
that makes sense , because travelers will need all the help they can get to plot a course through increasingly crowded airports			0
the number of yearly @entity19 commercial airline passengers is expected to nearly double to 1.2 billion by 2032 , according to the @entity340			0
as increasingly complicated smart - phone partnerships evolve between the tech world and the sprawling travel industry bureaucracy , it looks like growing pains will be unavoidable .			0
