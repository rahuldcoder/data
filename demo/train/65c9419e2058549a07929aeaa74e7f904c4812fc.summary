-- @entity2 's first cricket tour of @entity3 in five years is set to be hit by a news blackout in an escalating row over press freedom			1
the high profile tour kicks off with a @entity8 international in @entity10 on christmas day , but all the leading news agencies , such as @entity12 and @entity13 , have decided against filing match reports			1
the disagreement stems from an earlier decision by the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) to exclude photographic news agencies from covering games , including the recent @entity21 series between @entity3 and @entity22			1
" it is regrettable that the politically - charged @entity2 tour will be affected by the @entity17 's failure to recognize the long - standing importance of photographic news agencies in the flow of sport and news images every day , " said the @entity23 , which represents a group of media organizations			1
" as a direct result of the @entity17 stance , great sporting moments from the cricket tours to @entity3 are going unrecorded and therefore lost forever			1
@entity22 's first four games were the hidden series and the @entity2 tour is heading for the same fate			1
that 's not good for cricket -- nor for the image of @entity3 abroad , " @entity40 , executive director of the @entity23 , was quoted on its website			2
the @entity17 offered it 's own photographic content for the @entity3 - @entity22 series , but newspapers and leading websites outside of @entity3 declined to use them			2
the @entity17 is arguing that international news agencies such as @entity52 use the pictures for commercial as well as strictly editorial purposes and should pay a license fee			0
the @entity57 ( @entity57 ) , said in statement : " all publishers , including those in @entity3 are concerned that the @entity17 has decided to act against the photographic agency sector which has for years provided images for editorial customers in every country without problem			2
this is denying the ability of editors to select from the best of photography for the benefit of readers			0
" as the row over media coverage escalated , security has been stepped up at the @entity76 ahead of the opening game			1
police bomb squad officers with sniffer dogs have undertaken a painstaking search amid fears that the game could be disrupted by protests from @entity85 nationalist organizations			0
it is the first time @entity2 has visited @entity3 for a series of matches since the 2008 @entity90 attacks which led to a breakdown in diplomatic relations between the two sub-continent nations			1
but they did meet in the semifinal of last year 's @entity96 in the northern @entity85 city of @entity98 when the prime ministers of both countries shook hands			0
@entity85 cricket fans are still digesting the news that their iconic batsman @entity104 has retired from one - day internationals with immediate effect			0
the 39 - year - old @entity104 had already retired from @entity8 internationals , but was expected to have been available for the three 50 - over one day international matches against @entity2 over the @entity110 period			0
over 3,000 @entity2 fans are expected to watch the opener and 60 - year - old @entity113 , who lives in @entity115 , told @entity116 that the fact the matches were going ahead at all was good news			2
" that the teams are playing each other on @entity85 soil is in itself a big thing			0
we should not expect anything more to come out of this encounter , " @entity113 , who cut a colorful figure in the green and gold of @entity2 , said .			0
