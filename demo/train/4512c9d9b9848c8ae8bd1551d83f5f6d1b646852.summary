@entity0 , @entity1 -- a group of @entity5 agents and officers sent to @entity1 ahead of president @entity7 were relieved of duty and returned home amid allegations of misconduct that involved prostitution , according to two @entity14 government sources familiar with the investigation			1
the 11 @entity5 members -- both agents and uniformed officers -- were interviewed saturday at the agency 's @entity20 headquarters , after which they were placed on administrative leave , assistant director @entity16 said in a statement			1
they are under investigation after preliminary findings revealed that they brought back several prostitutes to the @entity29 in @entity0 , sources told @entity2 on saturday			1
also saturday , the @entity14 military announced that five service members assigned to support the @entity5 in its assignment have been " confined to quarters " in @entity1 after they violated curfew and " may have been involved in inappropriate conduct " at the same hotel			1
the statement , from @entity14 @entity38 , did not offer more details , including whether prostitution was involved			0
the command 's leader , gen. @entity41 , said he is " disappointed by the entire incident and that this behavior is not in keeping with the professional standards expected of members of the @entity14 military , " according to the statement			2
the alleged misconduct overshadowed the start of the sixth @entity51 , where the president was to focus on trade , energy and regional security			2
none of the agents or officers being investigated was part of the president 's personal protective detail and @entity7 is n't based at the hotel			1
but dignitaries and journalists reporting on the hemispheric meeting were staying there , a @entity14 government official said			0
@entity7 : ' @entity68 is very well positioned in the global economy ' rep. @entity70 , chairman of the @entity71 , was briefed on the matter and told @entity2 that the government personnel brought prostitutes back to their rooms wednesday night and " one of the women did not leave the room in the morning			1
" a hotel manager tried to get in the room , and eventually the woman emerged and said " they owed her money , " according to @entity70			1
similarly , @entity14 government sources said there was a dispute between at least one @entity5 member and a woman brought back to his hotel over a request to be paid			1
at least one of the women brought to the hotel talked with police , and complaints were filed with the @entity14 embassy , the sources said			0
" @entity99 saw that report , and they immediately began an investigation , " @entity70 said			1
a hotel staffer gave @entity1 security personnel the entire list of @entity14 government personnel staying there , said a @entity14 military official who could n't speak for attribution because of the ongoing investigation			1
a spokesman for @entity1 's @entity110 declined to comment , referring questions to the @entity5			1
@entity70 , the @entity112 from @entity113 , said the issue is n't about any " criminal allegations but a dereliction of duty			1
" " my understanding is that there are no allegations of any crime being committed , " he told @entity2 's @entity117			0
" it violates the @entity5 code of conduct			2
" @entity5 spokesman @entity125 said that the group of agents in @entity128 were relieved of duty thursday -- prior to the president 's arrival in @entity1 -- and replaced after " allegations of misconduct			1
" the @entity14 government sources said that , because the trip already had a large security detail , only some of the recalled agents and officers were replaced			0
still , the sources said there was no threat to the president			0
@entity16 , the assistant director from the @entity5 , noted his agency 's " zero tolerance policy on personal misconduct			2
" he said that putting the accused employees on leave is " standard procedure " as the agency conducts a " full , thorough and fair investigation			2
" " this incident is not reflective of the behavior of our personnel as they travel every day throughout the country and the world performing their duties in a dedicated , professional manner , " @entity16 said			0
" we regret any distraction from the @entity51 this situation has caused			2
" the @entity14 military is conducting its own investigation and will mete out " punishment , if appropriate ... in accordance with established policies and the @entity170 , " the @entity38 said in its statement			0
a senior military official and senior @entity5 official decided the five @entity14 service members would stay in @entity1 , confined to their hotel except for work - related business , because their " special skills " were still needed , according to a @entity14 military official			1
barred from contacting others about the matter , they will return to the @entity14 with the rest of their unidentified unit at the end of the mission , according to the military			0
@entity187 , a former @entity188 reporter who has written a book about the @entity5 , called the incident " clearly the biggest scandal in @entity5 history			2
" the @entity188 , which was the first to report the story , said it was alerted to the investigation by @entity187			0
@entity196 -- president of the @entity197 , which represents @entity5 agents and other federal law enforcement officers -- urged caution in jumping to conclusions , characterizing the incident as " isolated " and not necessarily a scandal			2
" that 's just sort of an overdramatic interpretation of an isolated incident , " he said			0
" we have to trust the process of the internal review			0
" while soliciting prostitution is legal in certain areas of @entity1 , it is considered a breach of the agency 's conduct code , the government sources said			2
high - level officials in the @entity5 and the @entity220 were outraged over the incident , the sources said , noting that the investigation indicated the prostitutes were brought back to a hotel that had been secured for the summit			1
the president arrived in @entity0 on friday , the same day he first learned about the incident , @entity227 press secretary @entity226 said from the coastal resort city			0
@entity7 will spend more time in @entity1 , where security concerns had limited previous presidential trips , than any other @entity14 president			1
two nearly back - to - back explosions in @entity0 -- which caused only minor damage and no casualties , @entity110 spokesman @entity237 said -- were a reminder of the violence that has gripped @entity1 as its government has battled powerful drug cartels			0
violence has significantly fallen off in recent years as the @entity244 - based government , aided by @entity14 extradition efforts , has successfully picked apart the cartels			0
still , there is an extensive security presence in the walled colonial city of @entity0 for the summit -- including more than 7,600 police officers and thousands more troops			0
@entity2 's @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 and journalists @entity260 and @entity262 contributed to this report .			0

rep. @entity70 says prostitutes were brought to a room , and one woman did n't leave
5 troops working with the @entity5 in @entity1 are also under investigation
