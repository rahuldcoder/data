-- we are now five days away from the attempted terrorist attack to blow up @entity3 to @entity4 , @entity5			0
we are learning more each day about the multiple failures in our security and intelligence system that preceded that attack			1
it is worth discussing the most egregious thus far and the way forward to building a better system			0
the facts suggest that an @entity15 plot was hatched in @entity16 and involved the same radical cleric who communicated with the man accused in the @entity20 shootings before the deaths of 13 @entity23 soldiers			1
and the attempt to blow up a @entity23 plane on @entity26 used a bomb technique similar to the one to that was used in august to try to assassinate the chief of @entity30 's counterterror police			1
having survived this assassination attempt , prince @entity31 flew to @entity33 , where he personally briefed @entity23 intelligence , law enforcement and national security officials both about the assassination attempt and on his concerns about the growing terrorism problem in @entity16			1
the @entity40 passed some information about flight 253 suspect @entity42 to the federal interagency channel , but they appear not to have passed along all the relevant information that they may have possessed			0
the @entity46 , which was created post- 9/11 to " connect the dots , " failed to do that and to ask the intelligence community for additional dots			1
furthermore , we understand that there was an intercept of @entity16 cleric @entity54 advocating @entity15 's use of @entity56 as operatives , but this was never put together with the information about @entity42			1
@entity54 is the radical cleric who was in contact with suspect @entity62 before the november 5 shooting of 13 @entity23 soldiers at @entity20 , but it appears that no one connected those dots either			1
our @entity68 allies revoked @entity42 's @entity68 visa for fraud because he lied on his visa application , but they did not inform the @entity23 because it was , in their judgment , not related to a national security issue			1
as president @entity75 said , there are both systemic and individual failures here			0
the president is understandably frustrated and under pressure to act			0
@entity42 should not have been able to get high explosives on a plane , the watch list system should have prevented him from boarding the plane at all , and the @entity23 intelligence community writ large should have been able to collect , analyze and disseminate critical intelligence			1
we will never encourage the risk - taking and creativity necessary to fix these problems if we indulge in the usual @entity33 bloodsport of the blame game			0
i have conducted more than my share of reviews , from the @entity93 recommendations to the @entity95 lessons learned			0
@entity75 needs people outside those directly responsible to look at what happened and provide him with an objective view			0
he now has the president 's @entity101 ( of which i was formerly a member ) , which can undertake such a review			2
it has been more than eight years since the tragedy of september 11			0
while we all wish we could forget the pain of that tragedy , our enemies relish remembering it and planning for what they hope will be their next success			0
we need to confront the growing sense of complacency in the bureaucracy and among the @entity23 people			2
we can only prevent a repeated success for the terrorists if the @entity23 people get the facts and the solutions to fix the problems that this incident has brought to light			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity126 .			2

former national security adviser @entity126 : it 's *crucial* to review what went wrong
she says agencies failed to put together intelligence that pointed to plot to blow up plane
@entity23 and intelligence community ca *n't* *afford* to be complacent , she says
