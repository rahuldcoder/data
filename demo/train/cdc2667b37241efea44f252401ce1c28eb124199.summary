-- on september 27 , @entity2 's president @entity1 had a 15 - minute phone conversation with @entity5 president @entity4			1
this was a historic moment , breaking a 34 - year spell , and roundly applauded in @entity9 and @entity10			0
there was , however , one notable exception			0
@entity13 , the head of the elite @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , promptly called the @entity4 - @entity1 phone conversation a " tactical mistake			1
" the @entity2 president , according to @entity13 , should have waited to make such a call until after " @entity5 's sincerity " in negotiating with @entity2 " can be proven , " as he put it			1
many in @entity10 interpreted @entity13 's comment -- not as goodhearted advice on foreign policy strategy -- but as a slap on the wrist on president @entity1			2
anxious supporters of @entity1 now wonder if the @entity14 will soon have an open season against the eight - week - old @entity1 administration and kill off any hope for @entity5 - @entity32 before it is given a proper shot			1
after all , the @entity14 generals see themselves as the epicenter of @entity36 in the @entity37			1
look at the @entity2 political formation and you will see that when @entity13 speaks it matters			0
he is the top general in @entity2 's top military - political force			1
he answers directly to @entity2 's @entity42 , ayatollah @entity43 , who appointed @entity13 back in 2007			1
and on @entity13 's watch , the @entity14 have entered the realm of politics as never before			0
these days the @entity14 generals regularly face off all other factions in @entity2 's byzantine bureaucratic setup			1
green movement just take developments since 2009 as an illustration			0
during the heyday of @entity2 's @entity54 opposition movement , triggered by the disputed presidential elections in june 2009 , won by the incumbent @entity56 , the @entity14 took the lead in cracking down on the anti-regime -- and anti-ahmadinejad -- protesters			1
in the months that followed , hundreds of protesters were arrested and scores allegedly killed in the clampdown			0
the @entity14 generals went out of their way to brand the leaders of the @entity49 as traitors , as foreign agents and spearheads of " seditionists			1
" read more : @entity2 lawmakers call for execution of leaders to the generals it mattered little that these @entity54 leaders had at one point been pillars of the same @entity80 system			2
now that they were questioning the wisdom of the regime 's policies they had to be punished , and harsh punishments were duly handed out			0
the two main @entity54 leaders , @entity87 , a former prime minister , and @entity89 , a former speaker of the parliament , have been under house arrest since february 2011			0
but while the @entity14 's brutal intervention in 2009 secured @entity56 's second term as president , they soon turned on him too			0
as @entity56 began to wander off on his own political path , the @entity14 by late 2010 began to denounce him as an imposter			0
he was denounced as the head of the " @entity98 , " a catchall phrase that @entity14 gladly now applied to the supporters of the same @entity56 they had gone out of their way to keep in the presidential palace			0
@entity103 hit back and famously labeled the top @entity14 generals as his " smuggler brothers , " a jab at the illicit economic activities of the @entity14 cartel , and ask them to stay out of politics			1
but the already unpopular and now weakened @entity56 could not outshine the senior men from the @entity14			0
not while they still had @entity43 's blessing			2
on august 3 , @entity56 left the presidential palace but the @entity14 generals are still looming large			2
' heroic flexibility ' but not even @entity43 , @entity2 's utmost power , is immune to @entity14 's predatory ways			1
on september 17 , @entity43 told a group of @entity14 commanders that he is not against " heroic flexibility " when confronted by adversaries			2
everyone understood this phrase to mean that @entity10 should now be open to serious negotiations over its nuclear program			0
@entity1 shortly after flew to @entity126 , emboldened that he had @entity43 's full backing to open a new round of talks with the @entity5 and the other nations in the @entity132 group			1
but not everyone in @entity10 was on message			0
two days before @entity1 's much - anticipated @entity137 speech , an @entity14 general sought to throw some cold water on the buzz around @entity1 and his mission of seeking @entity141 © tente with the @entity5			1
in a statement that seemed to question @entity43 's directive from a week earlier , the general said @entity2 " will not make any heroic exercise in regards to [ its ] nuclear rights			1
" the man behind those words is general @entity151 , the second - in - command in the @entity14			0
@entity151 and his boss @entity13 and the other @entity14 generals know better than openly defy the wishes of @entity43			1
this is why they go about it cautiously			0
they do not explicitly condemn @entity1 for talking to @entity4 , but call it a " tactical mistake			1
" they do n't say @entity43 's idea of " heroic exercise " is a bad one , but say it can not apply to the one topic that matters , @entity2 's nuclear program			1
if @entity43 wants to instil " heroic flexibility " in @entity2 diplomacy , simply because the sanctions are bleeding @entity2 and his regime to death and he needs a way out -- then the @entity14 generals do not have it in them to shoot down the trial balloons that he has launched			1
the @entity14 generals are politically not that powerful that they can override the @entity42			2
but it is very obvious that the @entity14 generals do not like any thawing in @entity2 's strained relations with the @entity5			1
they are principal stakeholders in the @entity2 regime and fearful they will lose out if the status quo is somehow transformed			0
the question is whether the generals will sit fuming at the sidelines and limit themselves to critiquing attempts to overhaul @entity2 's foreign policy or actively look for ways to sabotage it			1
supporters of @entity1 and his foreign policy agenda suspect sabotage and even violence			0
as @entity1 returned from @entity126 , his motorcade came under attack by hardliners just as he was leaving @entity196 in @entity10			0
this could be a harbinger of more to come			0

" these are not random but organized operations , he warned			0
there is no doubt that he had the @entity14 generals in mind too when he said that			2
sanctions in the fast unfolding saga of @entity5 - @entity2 relations , the @entity14 generals can be expected to play the role of a spoiler for some time to come			1
this reality no doubt disheartens the supporters of @entity1			0
but the @entity14 generals are just that , namely spoilers			2
they have not presented a single credible blueprint for @entity2 's to come out of international isolation and ways to stop the plummeting economic conditions			2
they have put on the old mantle of the armed defender of @entity2 nation but no foreign armies are lining up to invade			0
the @entity14 generals still look for legitimacy by pointing back at the role they played in defending @entity2 against @entity234 's invading army during the @entity235			1
but @entity2 's conflict today is not comparable to the circumstances of the @entity235			2
@entity2 is bleeding today because there is a global economic sanction regime against it , backed by a strong international consensus			0
@entity43 , certainly never a fan of the @entity241 or the @entity5 , grasps the difference			2
that is why he conceded to the need for " heroic flexibility " and looking for ways to break the stalemate			0
that is why @entity1 says he has the @entity42 's full backing to negotiate with the world			2
and unless the @entity14 generals can come up with an alternative narrative for the way forward for @entity2 , then all they can do is sabotage @entity1 's efforts and hope that they can get away with it			1

a september 27 phone call by the @entity5 and @entity2 presidents was the first in 34 years
the head of @entity2 's @entity272 called it a " tactical mistake "
@entity265 says the @entity14 generals see themselves as the epicenter of *anti-americanism*
but @entity1 has @entity43 's backing and all the @entity14 can do is act as spoiler , he says
