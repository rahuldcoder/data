-- a month ago , @entity1 paid an emotional tribute to his deceased mum after winning the @entity4 on @entity5			1
on sunday , the @entity6 was victorious again , this time at the @entity7 and this time on @entity8 , a fitting tribute to his @entity9 , a retired corporate executive			1
" it was nice to win on @entity5 and our @entity8 [ in @entity6 ] was a couple of weeks ago and i did n't get him anything , " said @entity1 after a gargantuan eight - shot victory at @entity12 on sunday			1
" maybe this works today			0
" the 29 - year - old was in a class of his own during the four rounds , carding the lowest score over two rounds in the tournament 's history and , from that point , was never really challenged by runners - up @entity27 and @entity28			1
@entity1 plays with a single sunflower on his bag , the favourite flower of his mother @entity32 , who died of complications from skin cancer in 2008			1
following his @entity4 victory , @entity1 said holding back the tears : " my mother was always there to be affectionate and show us love			1
when my @entity41 passed away , that stopped			0
@entity5 is always a nice day			1
" after his @entity12 win , the @entity6 admitted he still thinks of his mother every day but it was a victory dedicated to his father , who once flew over from @entity6 to his home in @entity50 , @entity51 , for a mere 24 hours just to celebrate his son overtaking @entity53 as world @entity54 in the spring of 2011			1
" he says ' next time in @entity6 , who knows if you 'll still @entity54 so i just wanted to take the opportunity to say congratulations ' , " recalled @entity1 of his father 's gesture			2
" and the next day he flew out to @entity6			2
not a lot of parents do that , and it was nice			0
it was a 30 - hour trip for pretty much 24 hours there			0
" a @entity70 @entity69 winner in 2010 , @entity1 tried to remodel his game to make it perfect , often leaving the driving range with bleeding hands , with his world ranking plummeting as the changes took time to work			0
bar the @entity79 - winning putt in 2012 , there were few highlights to speak of , with @entity1 not winning an individual event for two - and - a - half years by the time he was victorious at the @entity82 before becoming the first player from @entity84 to win the @entity7			2
" the way i play golf right now , i should n't think too much about technique , " added @entity1 , reflecting on his restructured game			0
" i 'm very happy with the way i hit the ball			0
" while @entity1 's recent victories produced a nice family tale , @entity27 's position as runner - up was even more remarkable given he had twice undergone heart transplants , once in 1992 and again in 2008			1
" when you have disabilities or you have health issues , some days are really bad and then you 've got to try to make the best of it the next day and wake up and move your body , " said @entity27 , who pocketed $ 790,000 after his share of second place			2
" and i 'm the perfect example of that			0
i 've been on my back twice and i never thought i would ever leave the house			0
" now i just finished second at the @entity7 which i do n't think anybody would have ever thought i 'd do that			2
you just ca n't give up			0
" @entity27 was diagnosed with viral cardiomyopathy at the age of nine but suffered a heart attack in 2007 with the new heart he was given aged 12 by a 15 - year - old donor who had been killed by a drunk driver			1
@entity27 drove himself to the hospital in @entity119 , calling his mother @entity121 to tell her he did n't think he would survive			1
seven months later , he underwent another transplant , this time from a 26 - year - old killed on his motorbike by a hit - and - run driver			0
as a result , the pressure of the business end of a major tournament is relative child 's play for @entity27			2
" i have been through a lot in my life , " he said , " and a lot more adrenaline pressure situations than hitting a tee shot on 18			0
