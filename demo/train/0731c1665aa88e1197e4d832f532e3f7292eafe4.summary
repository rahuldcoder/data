@entity0 , @entity1 -- tanks , troops and police pushed through the streets of two shantytowns in northern @entity8 sunday in a move to retake control of some of the city 's most crime - ridden areas			1
in the predawn operation , state authorities targeted the slums , or favelas , of @entity19 and @entity20 with more than 2,000 military troops and police			1
they have a larger long - term goal : securing 40 slums before the @entity25 in 2014 , and keeping them safe for the @entity26 two years later			1
police said they seized automatic weapons , guns and grenades and arrested dozens of people in a series of slum raids over the weekend			1
there were no reports of deaths or injuries sunday			1
on saturday , police said five suspected drug dealers were killed during a slum raid			2
police have already taken over about 30 favelas since they began operations in 2008 , but it 's an uphill battle			2
about one - fifth of @entity8 's residents live in the city 's 1,000 shantytowns , many of them perched on steep hills overlooking beachside condominiums			2
@entity19 and @entity20 are smaller favelas , far from tourist hotspots , but they became centers for organized crime and drug dealing after other slums were taken over by police			1
sunday 's operation there stands in stark contrast to the invasion of the @entity60 in 2010 , when more than 30 people were killed in shootouts			2
police now announce days in advance when they 're going to go into a community , to avoid major violence			0
but critics say it simply gives criminals a chance to escape to another slum , or the suburbs			0
authorities said they planned to set up a " police pacification unit " in @entity74 by december , and in @entity19 by january			0
three years ago , they took a similar approach in the notorious @entity77 , or @entity78 , slum where military police backed by the army seized control from drug traffickers			0
" they were abandoned for 40 , 50 years , " said maj. @entity84 of the police pacification unit there			0
" you ca n't recover that in three years			0
" but now , @entity84 told @entity2 last month , they plan to prove to the slum 's 40,000 residents that they 're here to stay .			0
