@entity0 -- @entity4 - based firms that use legal loopholes to avoid paying @entity4 taxes have effectively renounced any allegiance to their home country , president @entity2 will claim during remarks at a community college here on thursday			1
taking up a harsh new attack against companies that establish residency in tax havens like the @entity17 and @entity18 while keeping the bulk of their operations in the @entity4 , @entity2 will call on @entity22 to mend a loophole allowing billions in tax revenue to slip through the government 's fingers			1
a @entity28 official , previewing @entity2 's remarks , said the president would make the case on thursday that tax - avoiding companies " are essentially renouncing their @entity4 citizenship so that they can ship their profits overseas to avoid paying taxes -- even as they benefit from all the advantages of being here in @entity4			1
" the @entity28 has aimed this week to advance the president 's domestic agenda , focusing on jobs programs and the economy			1
bolstering the middle class has formed much of @entity2 's midterm election year pitch			2
but world events -- including @entity48 's ground invasion of @entity49 and furor over the downed airliner in @entity52 -- have largely overshadowed the intended topics this week , despite the @entity28 's attempts to highlight new job training measures			1
@entity2 's remarks thursday , which he 'll deliver at a technical college in downtown @entity0 , come at the end of a three - day fundraising swing which also brought him to @entity61 and the @entity62			1
the event will be the only public showing for @entity2 during his stay on the @entity66			0
he withstood some criticism for not canceling the trip , which aides countered by saying the president could conduct his job from anywhere			0
the @entity28 did , however , nix an appearance on " @entity74 , " replacing the late night show with a more sober @entity77 interview			0
@entity2 will touch on an issue @entity79 believe could help them win over voters in this year 's midterm contests			2
the president has long decried the inherent unfairness in large , multimillion dollar corporations that operate chiefly in the @entity4 but pay little in @entity4 taxes			2
he used the issue to attack @entity88 @entity87 during the 2012 presidential campaign			0
both @entity88 and @entity79 say the entire tax code needs an overhaul , but @entity2 is pressing lawmakers to take action now to prevent so - called " inversions , " which allow @entity4 companies to merge with foreign firms in countries with lower tax rates			1
in the past decade , at least 47 @entity4 companies have made the move			2
several inversions have been proposed this year and more are in the works			0
" we should prevent companies from effectively renouncing their citizenship to get out of paying taxes			0
what we need is a new sense of economic patriotism , where we all rise and fall together , " said @entity4 treasury secretary @entity106 in a letter to lawmakers last week , adding he believed any new measure should prevent companies from gaining tax advantages by incorporating overseas			1
@entity106 said a new law should retroactively bar any firm that moved abroad after may 2014 from enjoying lower tax liabilities			0
