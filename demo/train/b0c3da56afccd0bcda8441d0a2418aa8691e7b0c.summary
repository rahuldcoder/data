@entity0 -- with the architect of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks dead , @entity3 commandos in @entity6 's @entity5 compound quickly came upon another prize : a trove of hard drives , dvds and thumb drives that might provide evidence of other @entity15 operations			1
those materials , seized after @entity6 and four others were killed , have provided the first specific alert to come out of monday 's raid			1
the @entity3 @entity20 released a notice tied to rail security thursday			1
the unclassified notice to " federal , state , local and tribal partners " says that , in february 2010 , @entity15 members discussed a plan to derail trains in the @entity3 by placing obstructions on tracks , according to a law enforcement source who received the notice			1
@entity5 reacts angrily to tone of @entity3 questions the plan was to be executed this fall to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the september 11 attacks			0
but no specific city or rail system was identified in the notice , the source told @entity1			1
although a @entity3 official cautioned that the information does n't appear to suggest an imminent plot against @entity3 rail systems , the discovery may be the tip of the iceberg of potential plots			1
the haul included " lots " of paper documents , 10 hard drives , five computers and more than 100 storage devices , such as disks , dvds and thumb drives , a senior @entity3 official said wednesday			0
since monday , intelligence experts and others have pored over the find			0
a task force was set up at the @entity63 to comb through the evidence seized in the raid , according to a senior intelligence official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity			0
more details emerge about the raid at a @entity82 hearing wednesday , @entity3 attorney general @entity80 said of evidence taken from the residence , " as we glean information from that material , we will make appropriate decisions with regard to who might we add to the terrorist watch list , the no - fly list , all those things			1
" the @entity3 official who spoke thursday of the data said , " we take every possible threat seriously , so we are running all of this to ground			0
" when asked if there were any indications that @entity6 had signed off on the rail operation , the official said , " there is no information to suggest that there was some kind of ' blessed operation ' attached to @entity3 transportation systems			1
" the same @entity3 official says the @entity15 scheme , which included derailing trains over bridges and valleys , " does n't appear to be anything more than an idea on paper at this point			1
" @entity106 also indicated that @entity15 was particularly interested in targeting cities -- @entity0 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 , the official said			2
authorities sifting through the material learned @entity15 has considered striking on significant dates such as july 4 , @entity115 and the opening day of the @entity117 , according to the official			1
@entity6 's wife : we lived there 5 years @entity20 spokesman @entity121 echoed the belief that there was no imminent threat to the rail system			1
but officials " wanted to make our partners aware of the alleged plotting , " he said			0
" we want to stress that this alleged @entity15 plotting is based on initial reporting , which is often misleading or inaccurate and subject to change			2
" since sunday , @entity121 said , the department and other agencies have reviewed potential terror targets and deployed additional officers to nonsecured areas at @entity3 airports			0
homeland security secretary @entity137 told federal lawmakers wednesday a " number of actions " have been taken in response to the killing of @entity6 , among them " surging some resources " to @entity3 ports , airports and borders			2
" these include issuing advisories to fusion center directors , @entity20 advisers , major city chief intelligence commanders , private sector critical infrastructure owners and operators and other law enforcement entities , " she said at a @entity82 hearing			2
" we are and have been reviewing all open cases of potential @entity15 core , @entity156 ( @entity156 ) and @entity155 ( @entity155 ) operatives possibly in the @entity3 in conjunction with the @entity161 , " she added			2
sen. @entity162 , the @entity163 independent who is chairman of the @entity164 , asked @entity165 about the data removed by the @entity167 from the bin laden compound			0
" i assume that as this material is gone over , anything related to @entity20 will be shared immediately with your department ? " he asked			1
@entity165 responded , " it is being shared ( already )			0
" earlier this week , former cia director @entity174 told @entity1 's " @entity177 " that the " diffuse " nature of @entity15 is among its strengths			2
" keep in mind this is a network , not a hierarchy , " @entity174 said			0
