more than 20 years after a major study said there is no evidence that people who live near nuclear power plants face an increased risk of dying from cancer , the federal government will look anew at the subject , starting with seven nuclear facilities from @entity10 to @entity11			1
the @entity12 said tuesday it is pushing forward with the study because an oft - cited 1990 study is dated and because more modern methods of analysis and information sources are available			1
in a briefing paper , the @entity12 staff says that given the known amounts of radiation released from nuclear reactors , researchers would not expect to observe any increased cancer risks for nearby residents			1
nevertheless , the staff says , the studies would be " helpful to address public health concerns " and could be a tool for allaying public health concerns			0
while some civic groups have supported the study , the top industry trade group had argued against it , saying the study is " unlikely to produce scientifically defensible results			0
" in a pilot project to begin in the coming months , the @entity12 is commissioning the @entity36 to conduct cancer risk studies at six nuclear power plants and one nuclear fuel facility			1
if successful , the study would likely be expanded to the rest of the nation 's 104 commercial nuclear reactors			2
the six nuclear power plants in the initial study are : -- @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity11			1
-- @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50			0
-- @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity10			2
-- @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55			0
-- @entity56 , a decommissioned plant in @entity56 , @entity10			0
-- @entity58 , a decommissioned plant in @entity60 , @entity61			0
in addition , the pilot study will look at @entity64 in @entity65 , @entity66			1
the pilot study will take two to three years to complete and will cost about $ 2 million			2
for the past two decades , the @entity12 has relied on a @entity69 's report , " @entity72 , " published in a 1991 edition of the @entity71			0
that study showed no general increased risk of death from cancer for people living in 107 counties containing or near 62 nuclear facilities			1
when compared with control counties , some of the study counties had higher rates of certain cancers and some had lower rates			0
none of the differences could be linked to the presence of nuclear facilities , according to a synopsis of the study on the cancer institute 's website			1
" from the data at hand , there was no convincing evidence of any increased risk of death from any of the cancers we surveyed due to living near nuclear facilities , " @entity94 , chief of @entity69 's @entity95 at the time of the survey , is quoted as saying			1
but he cautioned that the study had limitations , saying , " if any excess cancer risk due to radiation pollution is present in counties with nuclear facilities , the risk is too small to be detected by the methods used			1
" several years ago , the @entity12 staff started efforts to update the study because of the ongoing public interest in the issue , said @entity12 spokesman @entity120			2
when the @entity69 indicated it could not perform the work , @entity121 directed the @entity12 to work with the @entity36			0
the academy developed methods for assessing radiation near nuclear plants and for assessing cancer rates in nearby communities			2
the academy recommended performing two types of epidemiology studies -- a geography - based study of people with various cancers leaving near nuclear facilities , and a study of cancers in children born near nuclear facilities			1
the academy selected the six nuclear power plants because they were a " good sampling " with different operating histories and population sizes			0
of the 74 individuals or organizations to comment on the proposed study , 44 encouraged the @entity12 to proceed			2
but the @entity148 did not support the study , saying an epidemiological study " will likely involve an outlay of significant resources without much expectation " it would advance scientific understanding of potential risks			0
other cancer risk factors , such as smoking or exposure to medical radiation , may surpass the effect from power plant releases and " overwhelm the actual effect attributed to the releases , " the group said .			0

@entity12 is pushing forward with the study because an oft - cited 1990 study is dated
seven nuclear facilities from @entity10 to @entity11 will be involved in the pilot study
researchers would *n't* expect any increased cancer risks for nearby residents , @entity12 says
