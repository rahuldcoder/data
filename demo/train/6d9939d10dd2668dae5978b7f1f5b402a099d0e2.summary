-- @entity3 's @entity2 international midfielder @entity1 has suffered another injury setback in his battle to return to first team action			1
@entity1 played a part in just six @entity9 matches during the first half of the 2009 - 10 season , lasting the whole 90 minutes only once due to a string of injuries			1
his knee and toe caused the most frequent problems and it is the latter which has forced him to miss the first session of @entity3 's winter training camp in @entity21			2
@entity3 coach @entity22 told the club 's official web site : " it is practically incredible and very bitter for the coach and the team			2
" but we can not change it			0
we hope that the medical department works hard and he returns as quickly as possible			0
" @entity1 had joined the rest of his team - mates for a jog around @entity35 on sunday before the flight to the @entity37 , but upon arrival in @entity21 both of his big toes were swollen			1
holes were drilled into the toenails to release an accumulation of blood and relieve the pain in a bid to get the 26 - year - old back on his feet as soon as possible			1
meanwhile , @entity3 are looking to trim their squad , despite four players leaving the @entity53 giants during the winter break			2
@entity3 have offloaded @entity55 to @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 to @entity59 and @entity60 to @entity61 , but director of sport @entity62 claims that is just the tip of the iceberg			0
" we are going to try to reduce the wagebill futher , " he told @entity68 magazine			0
" the wages have gone through the roof and therefore we have got to get our message through to the players that a new contract does not necessarily mean a pay rise			0
" @entity55 was @entity3 's biggest earner alongside @entity1 , whose future is already the focus of intense transfer speculation and who , given the implied cost - cutting measures , now seems even less likely to commit himself to a new contract			1
@entity3 president @entity84 has already revealed the @entity85 will be sold in the summer if he does not extend his contract beyond 2011 , although an exception still may be made to @entity3 's wage structure to keep hold of the 26 - year - old			1
" every case has to be dealt with individually and according to the market , " added @entity62			0
however , after spending almost 80 million euros on new players last summer , @entity62 insists his club has " reached the limit " as far as signing new players is concerned .			0
