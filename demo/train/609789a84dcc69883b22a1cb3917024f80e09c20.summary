-- @entity1 , baby ! @entity3 stars as a flamboyant @entity5 fashionista in " @entity6			1
" there 's a @entity9 theory that everything sounds funnier delivered with a @entity12 accent			0
that 's tested to the limit in @entity3 's newest provocation , " @entity6 , " but it 's not what comes out of his mouth that makes the @entity5 fashionista such a handful			1
the man in the tight yellow lederhosen knows that in our visually overstimulated culture , a picture is vorth a thousand vords			0
more if there 's significant skin involved -- and he 's happy to show us his wurst			1
@entity3 seems to believe that prudery is the enemy			2
certainly , bad taste is his trojan horse			0
an early montage of romantic coupling , @entity6 - style , is enough to get tongues wagging -- or clucking in disapproval			2
it 's the closest thing to gay porn most heterosexuals will see this side of " 300			2
" either way , @entity3 's laughing : properly managed , outrage is a useful marketing tool , as " @entity48 " showed			1
apparently permanently airbrushed right down to his backside , @entity6 looks nothing like his hirsute @entity52 cousin , but the men share an ego ; they 're equally insensitive to other people and oblivious to notions of social decorum and the politically correct			2
and they both invest heavily in the @entity58			0
@entity6 hungers after fame as hungrily as @entity48 lusted for @entity60			2
after a brief prologue in @entity62 -- and the distressing revelation of the vacuity of the fashion scene -- he sets out for @entity66 , determined to become @entity5 's " biggest superstar since @entity68			2
" perhaps inspired by another @entity3 creation , @entity70 , he sets out to make a celebrity interview show -- but sadly , the only dupes ignorant enough to participate are " @entity81 " judges ( @entity74 chats about her philanthropic pursuits while perched on the back of an immigrant laborer ) and presidential candidates ( take a bow , @entity80 )			1
it 's not just about the scarcity of the guests , though			0
@entity6 does n't draw them out the way @entity48 did			2
quite the opposite : mostly they 're wary and guarded , or downright hostile -- and understandably so , often enough , given @entity6 's shock tactics			1
yes , it 's funny seeing him fire up a predominantly @entity92 tv studio audience by announcing that his " adopted " black baby is named @entity94 , but still , the scene tells us more about @entity3 's need to provoke than about the crowd 's supposed homophobia			1
the same goes for his brief stint in a @entity102 training facility			0
the actor 's quick wit and virtuoso physical comedy skills carry the day , but just as @entity6 is forced to abandon one dead - end celebrity scheme after another , the movie too seems to be casting about haphazardly for some real comic traction			1
evidently it 's not easy testing taboos in 2009			0
wherever @entity6 turns , he seems to be following in someone else 's footsteps			1
peace talks in @entity115 ( what @entity6 calls " @entity116 " ) ? @entity118 has been there , done that			0
camping out with the gun lobby ? @entity123 , " @entity122			0
" gay conversion ? did n't director @entity125 go there with @entity127 just last year in " @entity128 " ? meanwhile , @entity6 's love - hate relationship with his assistant , @entity129 ( @entity130 ) , only highlights how similar the new film 's few narrative pegs are to " @entity48			1
" some sketches do hit much closer to home			0
a series of interviews with stage moms and dads who eagerly sign up their infants to work with hornets , wasps , dead or dying animals , antiquated heavy machinery and sundry toxic substances is a real jaw - dropper , though the kicker is tempered by @entity6 's behavior			1
and , to its credit , the film saves the best for last			0
in a show - stopping climax ( which i do n't propose to spoil here ) @entity3 puts it all on the line and definitively nails gay - bashers where it hurts : right between the eyes			1
ireport.com : " @entity6 " vs. @entity48 " : preview audience weighs in it 's an elaborate -- and brave -- stunt by which @entity6 ultimately achieves the fame he craves			1
and it does more than enough to validate the film 's fast and loose play with stereotypes and questionable undercover tactics			0
" @entity6 " has its problems , but the finale makes it a winner			1
" @entity6 " is rated r and runs 83 minutes			0

" @entity6 " is @entity3 's new film ; he plays gay fashionista
film *attempts* to show homophobia but in some cases pushes too hard
still , last scene makes it worth it , says reviewer @entity185
