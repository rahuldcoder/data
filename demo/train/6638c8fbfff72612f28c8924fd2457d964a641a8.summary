-- @entity2 national guard troops have rescued some inmates from a prison where a standoff between prisoners and authorities continued tuesday , but hundreds more remain inside			1
armed inmates inside the @entity10 prison in the northern state of @entity12 , east of @entity13 , have rejected government calls to disarm since last week			1

about 3,500 troops were surrounding the @entity10 prison , the agency reported			1
the operations at the rodeo prison complex come a week after a prison riot that left 22 dead			2

the inmates allegedly attacked each other with weapons , the commission said			1
details of the situation inside @entity10 are hard to come by			1
however , a video that surfaced on @entity58 purports to show the scene inside one of the prisons			1
the video , which was aired by @entity2 news outlet @entity64 24 , shows what appears to be the inside of a prison filmed by one of the inmates			1
the date the video was shot and the location where it was shot were not verified			2
in the video , two white freezers are shown and opened			2
inside each , there is one body			0
" we have to keep them in the freezer , so they do n't rot , " the narrator says			0
he describes the bodies as " two of the compatriots who have died in the fight			0

" a recent feature by @entity123 looked at the @entity125 prison in @entity126 , on @entity127			0
the rule of authority had deteriorated so much there , the paper found , that it " looks more like a @entity133 - inspired fleshpot than a stockade for toughened smugglers			0
" the prisoners there run the show , one inmate told the paper			0
among the problems that the commission cited were inmates ' possession of weapons , extortion of inmates , overcrowding and lack of medical care			2
the @entity46 has repeatedly recommended -- and reaffirmed after last week 's riot -- reducing the overcrowd conditions , confiscating weapons , and establishing a division between those who are being prosecuted and those who have been convicted			2
the commission also recommended better trained guards and better investigations into acts of violence inside the prisons .			1
