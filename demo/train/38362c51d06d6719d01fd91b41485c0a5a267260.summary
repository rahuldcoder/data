@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity5 -- working on information from an aging reputed mobster -- began digging in the waist - high grass of a @entity8 - area field monday in yet another search for the remains of former @entity12 boss @entity11 , according to a law enforcement source with direct knowledge of the investigation			1
the information that sparked the latest hunt in the nearly four - decades - long search for @entity11 is " highly credible , " the source said			1
agents were executing a search warrant for a field in @entity0 , north of @entity8 , based in part on information provided by alleged mobster @entity25			1
the paperwork filed under seal that accompanies the search warrant is described as " several pages long , " according to the source , and it explains why the @entity5 believes the search is justified			0
" the information provided by @entity25 is highly credible , " the source said			1
by late afternoon , the search had been underway for several hours but there were no indications of any developments			0
the search was on private property , and media and curious onlookers were kept some distance from the search site			0
@entity5 special agent @entity42 , head of the agency 's @entity8 office , told @entity2 at the scene that the information leading to the search " reached the threshold of probable cause , which was sufficient to allow us to obtain a search warrant			1
" if it did n't rise to that level then , certainly , we would n't be out here			0
" earlier this year , @entity25 , now in his 80s , told @entity56 's @entity55 that @entity11 was buried in a @entity1 field about 20 miles north of where he was last seen in 1975			1
the @entity5 has spent months looking into @entity25 's claims before seeking court authorization to excavate the field and look for evidence of a shallow grave , according to the source			1
contrary to what 's been previously thought for years , @entity25 said he was told @entity11 's disappearance was not connected to @entity70 family @entity68 crime boss @entity67 who allegedly wanted to get rid of @entity11			1
instead , according to the source , @entity25 told the @entity5 @entity8 mobsters wanted @entity11 dead			1
at the time , @entity11 was thought to be setting the stage to get back into a power position with the labor movement after he was released from prison			0
he was convicted in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud			0
president @entity80 pardoned him in 1971			0
@entity11 , then 62 , was last seen on july 30 , 1975 , outside a @entity8 - area restaurant			1
the @entity5 said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to @entity11 's efforts to regain power in the @entity12 and to the mob 's influence over the union 's pension funds			2
@entity25 was in prison himself when @entity11 disappeared			2
@entity25 , according to the source , said he when he was freed , he asked a mob enforcer what happened to @entity11			2
the mobster allegedly told @entity25 that @entity8 's crime bosses ordered the @entity11 hit			1
they lured him to a meeting , then drove him to a farm owned by a mob underboss			0
the enforcer allegedly told @entity25 that @entity11 was killed and buried on the property , which covers several acres			2
the area being searched monday was described as relatively small -- about the size of a small party tent , according to the source			0
@entity11 's disappearance and presumed death have vexed investigators in the years since his last sighting			0
as recently as october , soil samples were taken from a home in the suburban @entity8 community after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried in the yard a day after @entity11 disappeared			2
the soil samples were tested , and showed no evidence of human remains or decomposition			0
@entity25 , freed in 2008 after his last prison sentence , was convicted of crimes in connection with organized crime in @entity8			0
@entity125 , a former @entity126 attorney , told @entity2 earlier this year that @entity25 headed a @entity8 organized crime family from 1970 to 1975 , but was in fact in prison when @entity11 disappeared			1
in an interview with @entity2 affiliate @entity131 , @entity25 denied playing any role in @entity11 's disappearance			2
