-- @entity4 and his wife @entity5 are used to seeing the plants shrivel around them , the earth crack and their cattle die			2
every time a drought has hit this elderly couple 's village in northern @entity11 they have had to rebuild their lives all over again			1
" the last drought was bad , " 69 - year - old @entity4 says			1
" during the drought time there was n't even any water to drink			1
the animals had nothing to eat			2
and there was only dust blowing			0
i felt very bad and i was very bitter			0
i wanted to run away but there was nowhere to run			0
" the searing heat spread across the @entity27 last june , destroying livestock , ruining lives and decimating entire communities			1
when the heavy rain clouds eventually arrived in northern @entity11 the people in the @entity33 village , near the town of @entity35 , came out of their homes and danced			1
' we could n't even eat the seeds ' : drought affecting millions by then @entity41 and @entity5 had lost 10 of their 15 cows , but they danced too			1
they knew they would struggle to support their nine children without these animals but this drought was different -- for the first time in their lives @entity41 had taken insurance out on some of their cattle			1
shortly before the first leaf wilted from the heat , an insurance promoter had come to their small village offering livestock insurance			1
it was a new initiative that has been trialed in this part of @entity11			0
@entity4 was skeptical -- he 'd never heard of insurance and he was n't sure that he would ever see his money again			1
after talking it through with @entity5 he eventually decided to sign up and pay a premium for a few of his cows -- he could n't afford to cover them all			0
" this insurance is good , " he says , sitting on a stool outside his home , his surviving cattle listlessly tied up behind him			1
once the rains came 650 herders eventually received compensation for the loss of thousands of animals			0
@entity4 and @entity5 did not get enough to buy new cows but they did manage to buy some goats			0
this initiative is run by the @entity76 - based organization , the @entity75 ( @entity75 )			0
it is one of a growing number of micro-insurance schemes being rolled out in @entity81			1
backed by @entity83 and @entity85 government development departments and the @entity86 , there are plans to expand this project across northern @entity11 and into southern @entity89			0
some farmers chose not to join the insurance initiative			1
others could not afford the premiums			0
@entity94 lives just across the mud track from @entity96 and @entity5			0
like @entity41 he relies on his cows to support his family but when the insurance man came to visit @entity94 decided to prioritize paying the school fees			1
he lost 11 of his cows and has struggled to support his 11 children ever since			0
" we were faced with a severe drought and we had a lot of problems , " he says			1
" now we know the importance and value of insurance			1
i am now ready to insure my livestock			0
" elephants and livestock battle for water in @entity81 when drought hits such remote and vast areas it is impossible to count all the dead animals , so this initiative uses satellite images to quantify the loss of foliage in each area			1
this then determines who should be compensated and by how much			0
one of the biggest challenges of introducing insurance in remote rural villages is the lack of knowledge and understanding			1
this is where insurance promoters like @entity132 come in			1
as a farmer himself @entity132 knows all about being ravaged by drought			2
" over 80 % of our population are illiterates			0
understanding this insurance issue was just too hard , " he explains			1
" but with the time and with the information in the language they understand and the values and importance , now they are getting it and catching up			0
" " micro-insurance for agriculture is something that farmers in the rest of the world have had access to for sometime , " says @entity150 from the @entity151			2
" @entity160 farmers , the poorest and smallest scale farmers are only just beginning to have access to and their ability to do that can really help the agriculture sector to grow and become more productive			2
" @entity151 and @entity166 have their own micro-insurance initiative for agriculture in @entity89 and it 's now being expanded into @entity169			2
@entity150 warns that insurance by itself is n't a magic bullet so it 's important to combine insurance with other forms of risk management , including access to credit and savings			1
nearly 400 million people in @entity81 live below the poverty line , and most of them depend on agriculture for their livelihoods , so vulnerability to climate - related shocks is a constant threat to their food security and well - being , the @entity151 warns			1
@entity11 's @entity190 people facing climate catastrophe back in @entity33 , @entity192 stands out with her small frame consumed by a large @entity195 jumper			2
unlike @entity41 , @entity5 and @entity94 , she has chosen not to restock her herd			0
" i am very bitter about the drought , " she says			2
" i was about to die of hunger and i lost all of my livestock , i had no shelter and no husband			0
i had a lot of animals but i only bought insurance for two cows and i had to borrow money to afford it			2
now all our animals are dead			0
" her cattle were insured but she has had enough of drought and , from the look on her face it 's clear she has had enough of struggling			2
she was compensated but she used the money to build herself a mud - walled , corrugated iron - roofed home instead			0
it 's small but she is clearly proud of it and her neat little garden at the front			0
across from @entity192 's new home someone else 's animals feast on the lush green grass			0
the rains are here now but further down the hill the new foliage covers the bones of the animals who did not make it			0
@entity234 's memories of drought may fade but , like these bones , they will never disappear			2
if his years have taught him anything it 's that insurance or not , drought will happen once again in this climate of extremes .			1

vulnerable communities across the @entity27 have long been *scarred* by drought
insurance is becoming an important way of *protecting* and compensating those affected
nearly 400 million people in @entity81 live below the poverty line , and depend on agriculture
lack of understanding is one of biggest challenges of introducing insurance in villages
