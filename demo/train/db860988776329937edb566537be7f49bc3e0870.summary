has published its latest @entity5 detailing the ongoing threats to biodiversity on the planet			1
the @entity4 assessed a total of 63,837 plant and animal species around the globe which revealed 19,817 of that number are currently threatened with extinction , with 3,947 described as " critically endangered " -- the final classification prior to extinction			1
a further 5,766 are " endangered , " while more than 10,000 species are listed as " vulnerable			2
" " sustainability is a matter of life and death for people on the planet			0
a sustainable future can not be achieved without conserving biological diversity ... not only for nature itself but also for all seven billion people who depend on it , " @entity24 , @entity4 director general , said in a statement			1
" ( the latest report ) is a clarion call to world leaders gathering in @entity3 to secure the web of life , " @entity32 added			1
see also : can @entity3 solve world 's environmental problems ? amphibious creatures like frogs , toads and newts are the most endangered group with 41 % facing extinction			1
a quarter of all mammals and 13 % of bird species are heading towards a similar fate			1
@entity50 biodiversity is continuing its decline with a third of all reef - building corals threatened by extinction which could cause potentially catastrophic consequences for humans			1
more than 275 million people are dependent on coral reefs for food , coastal protection and their livelihoods , according to the @entity4			1
the reef fishing industry is worth $ 6.8 billion annually but overfishing is now affecting more than half the world 's reefs			2
" the services and economic value that species provide are irreplaceable and essential to our well being , " @entity65 ­ guez , deputy chair , @entity66 , said in a statement			2
" unless we live within the limits set by nature , and manage our natural resources sustainably , more and more species will be driven towards extinction			2
if we ignore our responsibility we will compromise our own survival , " he added			0
plants also continue to face severe threats			2
two species ( @entity84 and @entity85 ) were officially declared extinct in 2012 and 30 % of conifers are under threat			1
" recent work on plant assessments suggests that around one in five plants are threatened with extinction , " says professor @entity88 , director ( ceo and chief scientist ) , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94			1
" three quarters of the world 's population depends directly on plants for their primary health care			0
eighty percent of our calorie intake comes from 12 plant species			1
if we care about the food we eat , and the medicines we use , we must act to conserve our medicinal plants and our crop wild relatives , " he added			0
@entity113 , @entity114 at the @entity92 says that every plant extinction makes it more challenging for humans to adapt to change			2
" you look at all the big environmental problems -- food security , water scarcity , energy , climate change mitigation and adaptation -- the fact is we need to adapt and innovate , " @entity113 said			0
" we have always adapted and innovated -- 10,000 years ago we innovated with agriculture			0
but we can only innovate if we have access to a full range of plant diversity , " he added			0
the seed bank at @entity93 , the largest of its kind in the world , currently stores 11 % ( around 31,000 specimens ) of the world 's plant species			1
@entity113 says the plant extinctions that have occurred since the first @entity3 in 1992 have all been entirely avoidable			1
" there is no technological reason why a plant species should become extinct			1
to collect and preserve an entire species which we can keep in the seed bank here for 200 years costs about Â £ 2,000 , " he said			0
@entity113 says the failures to forge ahead with environmental action in recent years have been down to lack of political will			0
" i think because people are incapable of thinking in the long term -- particularly politicians and our leaders			0
there has n't been either priority or resource given to these tasks , " he said			0
but he remains upbeat about @entity3			2
" you 've always got to be optimistic , " @entity113 said			0
" the problem with any consensual approach is that it takes a very long time			0
it has become highly politicized and dominated by lawyers			0
that 's the problem with any multilateral consensual system			0
" but others , like @entity166 , director general of @entity167 is deeply concerned that @entity3 talks will stall			1
in a statement released by @entity167 on tuesday , @entity169 said the summit is " doomed to ridicule " unless world leaders " get serious about sustainable development			1
" @entity169 laments the revisions to the @entity3 negotiating text made by diplomats over recent days which have swapped " weak words for toothless language , " he argues			2
" they 've added some positive actions around oceans protection			0
but the text has lots of words that ' commit ' parties to nothing -- such as ' commit to promote ' and ' commit to systematically consider , ' " @entity166 said			0
" world leaders ' recognized ' problems 20 years ago , and they 've done little about them since			1
how long are we going to accept ' we 'll look into it ' as a solution ? " he added .			0
