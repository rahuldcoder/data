-- in opposing president @entity2 's opening to @entity3 , @entity6 's @entity5 senator , @entity4 , explained , " this entire policy shift announced today is based on an illusion , on a lie , the lie and the illusion that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the @entity3 people			1
" @entity4 has correctly touched on the core issue			1
but theory , logic and history suggest that he 's wrong in his conclusions			1
i would recommend to @entity4 one of the classics of conservative thought , @entity28 's " @entity27			1
" he does n't have to spend too much time on it			2
the first chapter outlines the " relation between economic freedom and political freedom			2
" the point @entity28 makes in the book is one that @entity38 's founding fathers well understood			2
drawing on the political philosopher @entity41 , they believed that the freedom to buy , sell , own and trade were core elements of human freedom and individual autonomy			0
as they expand , liberty expands			0
this is not just theory , of course			0
over the last two centuries , the countries that embraced " more commerce and access to money and goods " in @entity4 's phrase -- @entity60 , @entity38 , then @entity58 and @entity59 -- have moved toward greater prosperity , but also political freedom			1
if you exclude oil - rich countries , where money is not earned but dug from the ground , almost every country that has used free markets and free trade to grow is also a democracy			0
yes there are a few exceptions : @entity72 and @entity73 ( though the latter is still not quite a developed economy			0
) but on the whole , there has been a remarkably strong connection between economic freedom and political freedom			0
in @entity38 itself , the line has been clear			0
@entity84 's regime opened up its economy in the 1970s			2
@entity86 began to grow , but that growth then produced a stronger civil society that over time clamored for the end of the @entity84 dictatorship			0
( the same pattern could be seen in @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
) in @entity38 today , democracy and markets have acted to reinforce each other , transforming the continent , which 30 years ago was almost entirely ruled by dictatorships to one that is today almost entirely ruled by democracies			0
@entity3 is an outlier , one of the last regimes in @entity38 that has embraced neither markets nor ballots			1
the @entity2 administration is acting on the theory that more commerce , capitalism , contact , travel and trade will empower the people of @entity3 and thus give them a greater voice in their political future			1
and so the first point to make is that it will help @entity3 economically -- it will raise their incomes , their standard of living , and boost access to technology			1
these are all good things in and of themselves			0
but easing the embargo will also help @entity126 , who will benefit from being able to trade with a neighbor			1
this is the reason that conservatives have long understood that free trade is not a gift bestowed on someone			0
it helps both countries and in particular , helps the @entity126			1
that 's why the @entity138 's editorial page -- bastion of conservative thought -- has been an advocate on lifting the trade embargo against @entity3 , which is a far larger step than @entity2 's normalization			1
so , did it support @entity2 's opening ? of course not			1
it turns out that he has done it in the wrong way			2
it is difficult not to think that the problem here is not the policy , but who the president is			2
had @entity158 announced this initiative , i have a feeling that the @entity138 would be hailing it -- and @entity4 would be quoting @entity28 to us all			2
watch @entity163 at 10am and 1pm et. for the latest from @entity163 click here .			0

@entity166 : sen. @entity4 's conclusions about @entity3 opening wrong
easing the embargo will also help @entity126 , @entity166 says
he says @entity4 's position would be different if @entity5 president had made the change
