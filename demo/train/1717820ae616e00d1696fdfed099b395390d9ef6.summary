while president @entity3 has relaunched a massive public relations effort for the @entity5 , @entity1 opponents to the law have also implemented a relaunch of sorts			1
absent from their public outcry is any talk of repeal			2
it is a deliberate and significant shift in strategy for @entity1 in the @entity14 after years of beating the drum of repeal			1
for the first time since they regained control of the @entity14 in 2011 , republicans have no plans at the moment to bring up a bill to repeal the law -- something they have done nearly 50 times			1
instead , " we 'll continue to do everything we can to protect the @entity31 people from the effects of this awful law , " said @entity25 , house speaker @entity26 's spokesman , without saying that repeal was still part of the plan			2
a confluence of events hampered the @entity1 repeal effort and put it on pause			1
stand back the problems with the @entity5 exist beyond its balky website			2
the troubled roll out of @entity5 has also forced the president to delay multiple important components of the law , including the insurance marketplace for small businesses and the requirement that businesses with 50 or more employees provide their workers with health insurance or face fines			1
republicans realized they should have let the launch play out , instead their shutdown distracted from the @entity5 debacle			1
" never interfere when your opponent is committing suicide , " @entity57 , senior fellow working on health care at the libertarian @entity59 , said			0
instead , republicans have gone to great lengths to promote the negative aspects of the law by launching their own public relations campaign			1
the strategy is outlined in a 17 - page @entity1 playbook that @entity70 reported last month			1
during a news conference on tuesday , @entity1 leaders did n't utter the word " repeal " once			1
instead , they promoted reports that people have been canceled from their low - coverage insurance plans and that insurance plans in the exchanges have dropped doctors and hospitals from plan options			0
" the @entity31 people want to be able to pick their own type of health insurance , they want to be able to pick their own doctor and they want to be able to pick their own hospital , " @entity26 told reporters tuesday			0
" it 's all negative , " @entity57 said of the @entity1 strategy			1
" it 's to form this general feeling out there that it 's failed			0
" the law 's the law additionally , @entity1 opposition had been based on hypotheticals , now the rhetoric has become reality			1
" we 're not going back , " @entity3 said earlier this week			0
" i mean , that seems to be the only alternative that @entity5 's critics have is , well , let 's just go back to the status quo			2
" @entity3 urges young supporters to talk up @entity5 with that strategy , @entity1 could deprive the president of that argument			1
@entity1 strategist @entity110 said the change happened because circumstances changed			2
" the effort to defund @entity5 is that people were n't experiencing it yet			1
" now , " voters are starting to experience bad news , " he said			0
" as the law is being implemented , millions are either losing health care or having premiums go up , and @entity1 want to make sure that everyone recognizes that			1
" that has caused @entity1 to move away from their blanket calls for repeal to highlighting problems with the law			1
additionally , they could be proactively looking down the road			0
while some are being negatively impacted by the law , millions are expected to benefit			0
@entity131 's @entity130 wrote , " i think @entity1 leaders will be extremely reluctant to hold votes to nakedly destroy the law			1
" reality " to get rid of it completely would be very difficult , " said @entity135 , law professor at @entity136 , who was involved in @entity1 ' @entity138 challenge			1
@entity140 control the @entity141 and the @entity14			0
efforts to repeal the law have gone nowhere			1
the @entity59 's @entity57 said repealing the law " has n't been a realistic option for quite some time			2
" regardless , republicans pushed by their conservative wing shut down the government for 16 days in october in an effort to defund the health care law			2
" they do n't have to go down the legislative road to defund @entity5 at this point because it did n't work , " @entity1 strategist @entity110 said			1
lawmakers pass more blame than bills in do - nothing @entity156 the move , pushed by the most hard - right members of the party , including @entity161 sen. @entity160 and multiple members of the @entity14 , did not sit well with the public and distracted the country from the horrible roll out of the federal health care exchanges			0
the race for public opinion while the @entity1 have been taking to news conferences , committee hearing rooms and cable television to espouse the negative aspects of @entity5 , @entity3 has launched his own public relations campaign to highlight the bright parts of the law			1
he is working to reverse negative perceptions of the law that have increased since the law 's implementation at the beginning of october			0
and the president still has time			0
the latest @entity70 / @entity182 poll found that while only 40 % favor the law , 14 % of opponents say the law does n't go far enough			0
meanwhile , 53 % say it 's too soon to tell if the law will be successful			0
but @entity57 says the @entity140 do n't have a lot of time because " opinions harden " over time			0
the uncertain voter is what the @entity1 are hoping to tap into			0
@entity1 risk ? republicans might have realized that the defund or repeal argument is not politically advantageous as it is associated with the right - wing elements of the party			1
but that aspect of the party might not be pleased with their decision to stop trying to repeal the law			0
the conservative group @entity199 is still pushing the repeal agenda			0
@entity201 , vice president of public policy for the group , wrote in a recent news release that " @entity199 plans to redouble our efforts for full repeal			2
" " @entity5 ca n't be fixed ; it needs to be uprooted , " he added			0
@entity110 said @entity1 incumbents should n't be worried about primary challengers if they drop the repeal argument in the halls of @entity156 because they can still espouse it on the campaign trail			1
" republicans can still say defunding or replacing @entity5 , " he said , adding that they can point to the dozens of votes taken to repeal it in the past			1
" it 's hard to get ( to ) the right " of @entity1 incumbents on this issue , he said			0
@entity223 could still screw up your holidays repeal is n't going to be possible until " after the 2014 elections , " @entity110 said , hoping that @entity1 maintain their majority in the @entity14 and gain a majority in the @entity141			2
regardless if @entity1 continue to shelve the repeal argument , @entity57 said repeal will never happen			2
" there will be something on the books called the @entity5 , " he said			0
he just does n't know what it will look like in five or 10 years			0
if the law proves unworkable and not beneficial for @entity31 , expect @entity140 to join with @entity1 to alter the law			2
on the other hand , if the law is successful and voters are pleased , the law is unlikely to be rolled back			0
" if the positive stories begin to sell , then you wo n't get wholesale changes , " @entity57 said .			0

@entity1 has shifted its strategy on @entity5 away from repealing the law
@entity1 launched its own public relations campaign to highlight negative aspects of the law
the defund strategy has proven *counterproductive*
some on the right still pushing for republicans to keep repeal efforts moving
