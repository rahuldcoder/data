-- a lot of @entity2 probably look at the teachers strike in @entity4 and think that this is just another labor dispute with workers making demands and causing a work stoppage until they get what they want			1
but the @entity4 teachers strike , which is causing turmoil in the nation 's third - largest school system by shutting out of the public schools more than 350,000 students , is about a lot more than that			1
it 's not really about money			0
the deal on the table is n't too shabby			2
city officials are offering teachers a 16 % salary increase over the next four years			2
@entity4 teachers already earn an average annual salary of $ 74,236 , according to a study by @entity29 in @entity30			1
these are n't exactly blue - collar workers in hardhats trying to scratch out an existence			2
even @entity35 president @entity34 has said that the city 's offer is " not far apart " from what the union is seeking			0
this strike is about teachers unions testing their boundaries with @entity4 mayor @entity43			1
they 're hitting back at him for what they perceive to be the anti-union hardline position he took shortly after assuming office last year			0
more importantly , the strike is about something that is n't often discussed in the media or in politics : democrats are divided on education reform			1
in one camp , you have reformers who believe that all children can learn and that teachers and schools have to be held accountable for making sure that happens			2
in the other camp , you have teachers unions , whose job it is to protect their members but who now interpret that mandate to mean that they should protect teachers from public demands for greater accountability , higher standards and a better education for our children			1
the strike is testing the relationship between unions and the @entity82 administration , with which @entity43 is closely aligned having served as @entity85 chief of staff			1
these days , support for @entity82 from organized labor is lukewarm at best			1
labor unions did not spend as much money as they typically do in support of the @entity91 in @entity92			2
this was in part because union officials were angry that the event was held in the right - to - work state of @entity98			0
plus many of them do not think that @entity82 has been responsive to their concerns			1
teachers unions are especially angry with @entity82 , and with education secretary @entity104 , for adopting a policy that closely resembles that of their nemesis			1
" @entity82 has " @entity109			1
" both advocate high - stakes testing where teachers and schools are evaluated based largely on the academic performance of students and rewarded accordingly			1
( by the way , judging producers by their products happens all the time in the private sector			0
only in a public school system where mediocrity and low expectations are the new normal would that be considered a radical concept			0
) the @entity35 has never gotten over its resentment for @entity104 , who served as @entity4 superintendent of schools from 2001 to 2009 and implemented many of the same accountability measures that @entity107 and @entity82 embraced			1
that 's why @entity131 this week said this at a rally in downtown @entity4 , " the revolution will not be standardized			1
the assault on public education started here			2
it needs to end here			0
" and , as @entity131 sees it , who started the " assault " on public education ? @entity104			2
with the strike , the @entity35 is sending a strong message to @entity142 -- to both @entity82 and @entity104 -- that it is in charge of what goes on in the public schools , and it wo n't be dictated to by politicians in @entity4 or @entity142			1
and not even @entity148 , especially not @entity148 to whom teachers unions have given tons of money over the years			1
the teachers unions want politicians to know that the teachers they represent are sick and tired of standardized tests , merit pay and attempts to lengthen the school day			1
maybe they just want to be paid more and more while less and less is expected of them			0
after all , tragically , that 's the modern @entity161			0
so will the strike affect the presidential election at all ? @entity164 wasted no time in criticizing the @entity4 strike			1
that was a low - hanging fruit			0
his @entity168 base does not look favorably on unions and strikes anyway , and they know the score -- that the money that unions pour into elections on the side of @entity148 often makes it harder for them to elect @entity168			0
for @entity82 , the strike could turn into a headache			1
he would clearly love to stay out of it , but that might not be possible if the work stoppage drags on much longer			0
@entity82 will have to do something that he is often reluctant to do when it could alienate supporters -- show leadership			2
obviously , when it comes to education , @entity4 @entity148 are one big dysfunctional family that is feuding			1
well , it 's time to put a stop to it			0
@entity43 needs to assert control over this situation			0
the strike has gone on for a full school week			0
that 's long enough , especially since it is n't really about achieving a better deal for members as much as it is sending messages and settling scores			0
if the teachers are n't back in their classrooms on monday , the mayor needs to decertify the union , fire the teachers and hire replacements			2
it 's been done before			0
in february 2009 , at @entity210 in @entity211 , the school board voted to dismiss the entire faculty -- including more than 70 teachers -- as part of a dramatic turnaround plan			0
the school had a graduation rate of less than 50 %			0
the teachers were hired back a few months later after they agreed to certain concessions			0
at the time , @entity82 and @entity104 supported the firing , which is another reason why teachers unions do n't like this administration			1
" @entity225 " has a reputation as a tough guy in standing up to @entity168			0
now , if he wants to be a public servant and not just a partisan , it 's time for him to be just as tough in standing up to members of his party			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity234 .			2

@entity4 teachers strike is affecting more than 350,000 students
@entity234 : strike reveals democrats are divided about education reform
he says strike also tests the relationship between unions and the @entity82 administration
@entity234 : for @entity82 , the strike could turn into a headache if it is n't *resolved* soon
