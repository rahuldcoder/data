-- as always , @entity1 , the world 's largest mobile telephone extravaganza , is being held in @entity4 this year			1
but it really should be held in @entity5 , close to where @entity6 created @entity8			0
that 's because , with our increasing addiction to our mobile phones , we are in danger of creating a monster that we are less and less able to control			1
exaggeration ? when was the last time you went out without your smartphone ? how naked , how lost , do you feel without your mobile device ? how much essential data , i mean really personal stuff that you would n't want anyone else to see , does your mobile phone contain ? expect all the noise this week in @entity4 to be about more powerful phones from @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
these hardware companies will articulate the benefits of their technology in terms of " personal empowerment			1
" but the real truth behind these increasingly intelligent devices is personal disempowerment			1
such is the eerie reality of a phone that you ca n't live without			0
read more : full coverage of @entity1 some of the problems with our cellphones are already well known			0
last november , for example , the @entity46 epidemiologist and writer dr @entity47 told me about her research claiming that our cellphones could be giving us cancer			0
then there was @entity53 , the security expert , who explained to me how our mobile gadgets were spying on us			2
@entity53 even authored a book last year about this , entitled " @entity57 : @entity58 of our infatuation with @entity60			0
" @entity53 is n't exaggerating about this dark side			1
there 's an entire ecosystem developing around our mobile devices designed to spy on us			1
the @entity65 ran a chilling series entitled " what they know " which revealed how our @entity71 and @entity72 @entity70 devices were watching our every move			2
the surveillance and the mobile phone industries , @entity74 indicated , are becoming ever more indistinguishable			2
every day now seems to reveal a new mobile data scandal			2
only this week , for example , it was reported that @entity80 , @entity81 and other app makers were reading our text messages without our permission			0
the real problem with these phones is their increasing intelligence			2
just as @entity72 is designing the self - driving car , so tomorrow 's cell phone will become more and more all - knowing			2
by 2015 not only will there by seven billion mobile devices in the world , but they will -- empowered by artificial intelligence features like @entity96 's siri personal assistant and @entity97 , its new @entity99 competitor -- become more and more indistinguishable from the human brain			1
" what we 're talking about is a complete physical interface to the digital and virtual worlds , " the futurist @entity101 told @entity0			2
" so we need to bring more brains onto the device , " @entity101 explained , " so we can provide more relevant information when needed ... based on artificial intelligence			0
because that 's the kind of technology that brings the device closer our own reasoning capabilities			2
" but do any of us really want our cell phones to have our " reasoning capabilities ? " do we want to create mobile devices in our own image ? no , we do n't , i suspect			1
especially since , as mobile ad industry experts acknowledged to @entity0 , this will involve the creepiest kind of compromises , allowing them to eavesdrop and record every aspect of the lives we reveal to the world through our mobile devices			1
at one point , i wonder , do increasingly intelligent and autonomous cell phones incorporate such sophisticated intelligence that they become indistinguishable from us ? at what point will we find ourselves in a world described by the @entity134 - @entity46 satirist @entity133 in " @entity135 " where everyone carries a mobile device called an " apparat " that is able to identify the most intimate details of a stranger 's life ? meanwhile , my earlier @entity8 allusion is already being used by writers to describe our digital future			1
the best - selling writer , @entity146 , did indeed base " @entity147 " his latest thriller in @entity5 , the scene of @entity8			0
but whereas @entity146 imagines a world of massive computers acquiring human reasoning , a much scarier scenario is one in which this algorithmic power has been so miniaturized that it can be put inside our mobile devices			1
@entity101 even suggests that this intelligence will become so indistinguishable from us that it will actually become part of us -- fashionable spectacles will provide visual displays , earring studs the audio and a third device will touch input			2
he then warns us about a future in which virtual reality will become so mobile that we will be able to wear it under our skin			2
so what to do ? how can we stop our phones becoming @entity8 - like extensions of ourselves ? yes , there is a need for legislation fighting our snooping mobile devices			1
i 'm in favor , for example , of @entity46 president @entity180 's privacy bill of rights , and particularly his " @entity183 " legislation which he unveiled last week			0
and i applaud the work of legislators like @entity187 justice commissioner @entity186 and @entity189 congressman @entity188 who are aggressively looking into the information - collecting practices of @entity72 , @entity96 and the other big data companies in the mobile ecosystem			0
but the growing omniscience of our mobile devices is n't just a political issue			1
" practice safe phone " to combat their cancerous impact , dr @entity47 advises			0
but practicing safe phone extends to untangling ourselves from our mobile devices			1
it means fighting their growing power over us			0
it means reminding them who is boss			0
above all , we need to stop fetishizing cellphones			0
more than 60,000 people are expected to attend the @entity1 this week to gaze at new phones			0
but remember : all the coercively seductive new products unveiled in @entity4 in the next few days are just phones			0
they ca n't make us younger , richer , more virile or more intelligent			0
and they certainly do n't empower us			0
the real sense of empowerment comes from ( re ) establishing our mastery over our mobile devices			1
as @entity218 , the author of the excellent " @entity219 " argues , what this means is disconnecting ourselves from our mobile devices once a week			1
what it means is pressing the off button so that our smartphone can never become as smart as we are			0
