a key @entity1 senator said monday he has high hopes for a positive resolution soon to the growing diplomatic crisis revolving around 19 @entity1 overseas aid workers facing charges as part of an @entity9 crackdown on nongovernmental organizations			1
" quite frankly , i 'm very optimistic we 're going to get this episode behind us , " @entity12 sen. @entity11 of @entity13 told @entity14			1
" it 's my hope ( this will happen ) sooner rather than later			0
" @entity11 spoke from @entity19 after meeting with top @entity9 military and political leaders			1
he 's joined on the trip by @entity24 sen. @entity23 , chairman of the board of the @entity25 , one of the organizations affected by the @entity9 crackdown			1
@entity23 said he had an " excellent conversation " with several accused @entity1 workers now receiving shelter and protection at the @entity1 embassy			1
but there is naturally a " certain amount of concern , " he added			0
he stressed that he 's not personally negotiating the workers ' release , instead leaving those discussions to diplomats in the @entity42 administration			0
the @entity1 are among 43 people accused in a case involving foreign funding			1
they are scheduled to appear in a criminal court next sunday , a spokesman for the @entity9 general prosecutor 's office said			2
among the @entity1 is @entity49 , director of @entity9 operations for the @entity25 and the son of @entity1 transportation secretary @entity52			1
@entity49 is doing " fine , " but " he 's grown a full beard and he 's not nearly as good looking as he used to be , " @entity23 joked after meeting with the @entity1 workers			1
in december , authorities carried out 17 raids on the offices of 10 organizations , including the @entity1 - based @entity60 , @entity61 and the @entity25			1
the latter group describes itself on its website as a nonprofit and nonpartisan organization that " advances freedom and democracy worldwide by developing political parties , civic institutions , open elections , democratic governance and the rule of law			0
" @entity60 's website says it " supports democratic change , monitors freedom and advocates for democracy and human rights around the world , " supporting nonviolent civic initiatives in societies where freedom is threatened			0
the @entity61 says it works to support and strengthen democratic institutions worldwide " through citizen participation , openness and accountability in government			0
" @entity87 , a spokesman with the @entity9 general prosecutor 's office , said the raids were part of an investigation into allegations that the groups had received illegal foreign financing and were operating without a proper license			1
the groups have denied any wrongdoing			0
the @entity25 has said the prosecution is a " politically motivated assault " that " reflects escalating attacks against international and @entity9 democracy organizations			2
" while @entity9 may call the situation " a legitimate judicial process ... the continued assault on @entity1 , @entity107 and @entity9 civil society is not a ' legitimate judicial process , ' " the group said			1
" we 're being accused of things we 've never done , " institute president @entity25 said last month			0
" we are told we have operated without registration , and that is true because we filed our registration papers 5Â½ years ago			0
we were told the papers are complete , and we 're still waiting			0
" similarly , the @entity61 said it applied for registration in 2005 through the @entity9 @entity116 , " and has fulfilled all of the registration requirements for the past six years , including a number of updates provided in january			1
" the group said it will " vigorously defend the accused personnel			0
" " despite promises made by @entity9 authorities to the highest levels of the @entity1 government , we remain closed , our computers , files and cash still in the possession of the @entity131 , and our staffs face hostile interrogations by investigating judges , and now the prospect of arrest and imprisonment , " @entity60 president @entity135 testified last week before the @entity136			1
" nowhere else in the world has any of our offices been treated as they are in @entity9 , " @entity135 said			1
the @entity143 said last week it had received a 24 - page document from @entity9 authorities that lays out the specific charges against the staff of @entity1 and international democracy - building groups			1
the employees of the @entity1 and @entity150 ngos have been charged with operating in @entity9 without licenses			1
an investigation by authorities revealed that the organizations received millions of pounds from abroad under the names of @entity149 employees and not through their official bank accounts			0
@entity159 and @entity160 , the two judges handling the cases , said the charges could lead to five - year prison sentences			0
" these organizations conducted unlicensed and illegal activities without the knowledge of the @entity9 government , " said @entity159			2
" documents confiscated during the raids on the @entity149 offices confirm illegal foreign funding			2
" documents also showed that foreign workers employed by the @entity149 deliberately had tourist -- not work -- visas and did not pay taxes , prosecutors said			2
@entity9 officials have blamed continuing unrest in their country on foreign interference they attribute , in part , to the organizations			2
the crisis has jeopardized @entity1 aid to @entity9 and strained relations between the two nations			1
in a february 2 letter to secretary of state @entity189 and defense secretary @entity190 , 41 members of @entity187 urged the @entity42 administration to withhold further aid to @entity9 until the country 's leadership lets the organizations reopen and returns seized property			2
the situation may have been fueled by a sense of nationalism on the part of @entity9 's military - led government , which assumed control following the ouster of longtime president @entity205 a year ago , said @entity206 , a senior fellow at the @entity207			1
" it 's better in the short term to be seen as standing up to the @entity1 , " she said this month			2
" ... as the situation continues to be very unsettled in @entity9 , the powers that be will look for a scapegoat			2
blame your problems on outside powers			0
that 's how it has been throughout history			0
" but both sides have " painted themselves into a corner , " said @entity219 , a senior associate at the @entity221 program of the @entity222			0
the @entity9 have made a legal case , she said , and the @entity1 will find it difficult to tell them to interfere with the work of the judiciary when they are trying to push democracy			1
briefing reporters friday , @entity143 spokeswoman @entity232 said the agency 's legal team has held a number of meetings on the situation			0
" we continue to work very hard on these issues			0
so we need to let that work go forward and hope we can solve this , " she said			0
@entity232 has said no speedy resolution of the case was expected .			0

sen. @entity11 says he is " very optimistic " a resolution to the crisis is near
