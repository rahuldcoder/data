the visitors then doubled their advantage when former @entity3 striker @entity33 scored from the penalty spot after goalkeeper @entity35 was adjudged to have brought down @entity36			0
but @entity3 rallied and two goals in the last five minutes of the half brought them level			2
first defender @entity40 nodded home @entity43 's cross , then @entity12 top scorer @entity44 curled home a superb effort -- his 23rd league goal of the season			0
@entity3 maintained their momentum after the break and @entity51 put them ahead in the 51st minute when flicking the ball home from close range			2
by now @entity3 were rampant , and @entity1 made it 4 - 2 after 65 minutes after @entity56 superbly laid the ball into his path			1
with @entity5 demoralized , @entity1 then added a fifth just three minutes later , outpacing the visiting defense before firing home			1
to complete a miserable afternooon for @entity64 's side , midfielder @entity61 was shown a second yellow card for a late challenge on @entity29 as @entity5 finished the match with 10 men			0
the result leaves @entity5 seven points ahead of @entity3 , who go back above @entity72 on goal difference , although @entity5 are now eight points behind second placed @entity24 -- who closed the gap on @entity23 to just two points after a late 2 - 1 victory at @entity79 on sunday			1

@entity85 , who came out of retirement this season at the age of 37 , opened the scoring in the seventh mimute with a close - range header at the back post			0
but @entity79 looked to have rescued a point seven minutes from time when @entity98 fired home after his turn out - witted @entity101			0

@entity131 and @entity132 missed @entity109 's first two spot - kicks , but @entity111 conspired to miss three of their own -- two of them hitting the post			0
in an ironic twist , the final penalty miss was by @entity111 defender @entity140 , the cousin of the @entity109 captain .			0
