@entity0 -- the hacker who goes by the pseudonym @entity3 wo n't share her real name and declines to be photographed without her signature aviator sunglasses			1
at the annual @entity11 hacking conference here friday , gen. @entity7 , director of the @entity8 and head of the @entity10 , brought @entity3 on stage during his keynote address and called her " the most important person for our future			1
" @entity3 is 11 years old			2
for the second year in a row , @entity11 organizers included a full schedule of @entity23 programs for beginner hackers ages 8 to 18			1
the children and teens , who must be accompanied by a parent , learned how to pick locks , competed to find the most bugs in mobile apps and learned about digital forensics by investigating a mock crime scene in a hotel room			2
some skilled young hackers also taught classes and gave talks			1
to kick off the conference , @entity11 founder and veteran hacker @entity37 welcomed the kids with a talk on the ethics of hacking and rules for how to stay out of trouble with the law			1
" i think it 's harder for you guys now than it was for me , " @entity37 told a room of kids and their parents			1
@entity37 started the conference in 1992 because he wanted an open place for hackers to meet in person and share information			1
twenty years later , the young attendees from @entity11 's early years have grown up , established careers and started families			1
now they bring their own children to @entity11 to soak up the knowledge and culture , but this new generation faces a different set of rules and a maze of new laws -- not to mention parents who are savvy enough to know what they 're up to and keen on keeping their progeny out of trouble			1
navigating the law " i just want to open it , but do n't want to see what 's on the other side , " a young woman told and @entity37 and @entity75 , an attorney who works in the field of @entity78 law and policy			0
many of @entity23 ' school - age hackers are driven by the challenge of finding vulnerabilities in security systems and networks , not stealing information or money , or selling their knowledge to third parties			1
these " white - hat " hackers report any issues they find directly to the developers or relevant companies so they can be more secure			1
but good intentions are n't always enough when it comes to staying out of legal trouble			0
when @entity37 was starting out , computer technology was n't widely understood by law enforcement , and laws were n't yet in place that classified his actions as illegal			0
" technically , i was n't committing any crimes			0
i was n't stealing any money , was n't trying to break anything , " said @entity37			0
the @entity110 and international governments have since drafted complicated laws that criminalize many aspects of hacking			1
however , @entity75 pointed out that in many cases , the rules are still not clear or current , and that current laws are far behind what @entity11 attendees are doing			1
she recommended the kids avoid breaking laws by asking for permission before testing any systems , and if that 's not possible , to find a situation where they can ask for approval			1
" the lawyer perspective and mother perspective and ethics perspective is you can get in a lot of trouble if you do n't ask for permission			2
" @entity75 is married to journalist and former hacker @entity136 and has two children			0
@entity37 has his own test for deciding whether to hack something : " my rule of thumb is , do i completely own it ? if yes , i can hack it			0
" if hackers are unsure whether they are breaking the law , @entity75 suggests they check the @entity146 's ( @entity146 ) site , which spells out rules for everyone from bloggers to coders			2
the 22 - year - old organization also provides legal assistance for those who do get in trouble , taking on some cases itself or referring people to attorneys			0
building a reputation breaking the law is n't the only concern @entity37 , @entity75 and parents have for the budding hackers -- true anonymity online is harder to come by and a bad reputation can follow these kids into adulthood			1
@entity37 warned the kids that everything they do online now until they die will be backed up to the cloud			2
" that makes life more difficult for you guys , because if you get in trouble now , you 're screwed			0
" twenty years ago , hackers could operate in the shadows without leaving much of a trail			2
chat logs were n't recorded for long and hackers ' handles were n't easily traceable to their real - life identities			2
now , most communications that take place online are stored permanently and some can be dug up by law enforcement and human - resources departments			0
@entity37 was just a kid himself when he got started with computers			0
at 13 , his father brought home an @entity191 computer for the family			0
by 14 , @entity37 was online creating a new identity for himself , conversing with adults who were oblivious to his real age and spoke to him like an equal			0
" i could n't drive a car , but i could have conversations about politics with people in @entity200 , " he said			0
in those days , if someone made a mistake or needed a fresh start , they could create a new online identity			0
@entity37 got a do - over at an early age and recreated himself online as @entity37 , which grew into a trusted and respected identity he still uses now			0
today , a fresh start is harder to come by and old communications can surface at any time			0
@entity214 ceo @entity213 learned this the hard way when embarrassing instant - message conversations from his college days were made public years later			0
" your reputation is the most important thing you own , " said @entity37 , urging the young hackers to behave ethically , not because it will make their parents happy , but because they are the ones who will have to live with the results			2
hacking for good with so many dangers , why would parents encourage their children to hack at all ? @entity23 organizers believe in the good that can come from hacking , including making the country more secure and helping encourage freedom of speech around the world			1
" technology can really change the world , " said @entity75 , citing the liberation - technology movement that encourages hackers to help people spread messages from countries where online communication is restricted			2
the @entity110 government sees the potential in these bright young minds as well			0
the @entity248 ran the digital forensics program at @entity23 , hoping to encourage more education and interest in the field			1
and @entity7 met with three of the children before going on stage to give his keynote address			1
" this is our future , " @entity7 said of the kids			1
" what you 're doing here to help train those folks is absolutely superb , and you should be proud			0
