-- editor 's note : on april 21 , @entity3 , 63 , stepped out his front door to embark on a 525 - mile walk from @entity6 to @entity7 in memory of his son @entity9 , who took his life last year after a 13 - year battle with body dysmorphic disorder , a condition related to obsessive compulsive disorder			1
with a photo of @entity9 attached to his walking stick , @entity15 is visiting the schools , clinics and medical facilities where @entity9 had been treated over the years , as well as the places where he experienced the greatest joys in his short life			1
there he will share his story as a parent of a child with body dysmorphic disorder			1
the journey will end in downtown @entity7 on thursday , june 7			1
to engage in a " pilgrimage " in the 21st century is by its very definition an invitation to step outside of chronos time ( ordinary clock time ) and to enter into kyros time ( timelessness )			2
a walk to pound grief into the ground that is exactly what i did on tuesday , april 21 , when i walked out my front door in @entity45 , @entity46 , and began my seven - week journey by foot to @entity7			1
i invited in possibilities and gave myself permission to be open , attentive and present			2
expert q&a : will my daughter ever recover her mental health ? my huge undertaking has become a journey of faith where i allow true learning to happen			2
what have i learned so far ? i am learning about myself , about others and about my place and purpose in the world			0
my primary goals are to tell @entity9 's story -- so that awareness about brain disorders , especially @entity67 and @entity68 , can spread far and wide -- and to raise much needed funds for the @entity70 so research and programs can help other sufferers , their families and their friends			1
@entity67 in children : ' a darkness has overtaken me ' as nobly stated those basic intentions are , the learning that accompanies them can be quite unexpected and magical			1
i am learning that ... 1			0
not many people know about the cruel brain disorder , @entity68			1
they have heard of @entity67 , but not much about the former			1
therefore , i tell them @entity9 's story			1
you can never fully know whose life you will touch by making yourself available to others and by speaking from the heart			2
the first 10 seconds of my encounters with strangers are the most critical in gaining their attention and their willingness to hear more and to learn more			0
i usually vary my approach , but i must always choose my initial words carefully			0
they are the portals through which connections occur			0
when you mention brain disorders , you intentionally open the doors for your listeners to also share their stories about similar conditions in their own lives , in their own families and among their own friends			0
i 'm learning to be a good listener			0
if you put one foot in front of the other , you will eventually get somewhere			0
everyone seems to be rushing somewhere , mostly in cars , and do n't seem to be very happy about it			0
apparently , increasing one 's speed does n't necessarily bring happiness			0
acts of kindness still happen in the world based on my direct experiences of the generosity of others during these past weeks			0
life does n't get any better than when you live it fully outside			2
walking outdoors puts you directly in touch with nature but also with yourself			2
i marvel at my own resilience , resolve , flexibility and spontaneity			0
i never knew i already had these skills in such huge quantities			0
the best rule of thumb when walking is to be open , to be attentive , to be present and to let life unfold in from of you			1
i am " walking with @entity9			1
" @entity15 chronicled his experience on his blog , walkingwithnathaniel.org			0
