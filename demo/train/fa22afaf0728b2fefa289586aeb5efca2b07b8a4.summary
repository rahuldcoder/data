@entity1 , @entity0 -- when they set sail from harbor most yachtsmen leave only their worries behind			1
but when @entity8 goes out to sea , she sheds an entire way of life			1
@entity8 says she feels " a thousand times " more free when she sails			1
the 36 - year - old @entity13 is a quadriplegic who can only move her head , eyes and mouth and needs to rely on carers for almost every need			1
in spite of these restrictions she became the first disabled woman to sail solo around @entity24 monday scoring a victory against the rare degenerative illness she has suffered from since age 11			1
the inventive technology behind her voyage is called " sip and puff " -- a system of three pneumatic straws positioned near @entity36 's mouth that allow her to control the boat through a series of semaphore - like commands she can give by either blowing or sucking through the straws			1
developed by a @entity44 engineer , the system let @entity36 alter course and trim the sails of her 20ft long keel boat to complete the record - breaking trip over two summers			2
@entity36 's passion for sailing is all - consuming and , considering what it has given her , unsurprising			1
" when you leave the quayside , you leave behind the stresses of everyday life , " she told @entity2			2
" any sailor will tell you that			2
" if you multiply that sense of freedom a thousand times , that 's how i feel			2
i leave behind my wheelchair , a team of carers and suddenly it 's just me			2
" an @entity72 graduate and talented sportswoman in her youth , by 2003 @entity8 's illness had laid her so low she was a virtual recluse , never leaving the home she shared with her husband @entity78 , and by her own admission deeply depressed			1
a friend suggested she go to @entity81			0
the center specializes in helping disabled people on to the water , but @entity8 almost never made the 20 - minute trip from her home near @entity87 in southern @entity0			1
" i was ill and running a temperature and i was about to cancel it , but something stopped me from backing out , " she said			0
she credits the decision to go to the center with saving her life			0
" [ the staff ] treated me like an intelligent , capable person and not like an object to be pitied , " she said			0
her illness is called reflex sympathetic dystrophy			0
it makes it difficult for her to breathe -- the media interviews she has done since her latest achievement have exhausted her , she said			0
it also puts her in near - constant agony , a situation that is only manageable with the use of powerful drugs			0
despite these hardships , or perhaps because of them , @entity8 has no fear when she is out at sea			1
her aim is to help other disabled people feel empowered in the same way and to that end she has set up her own charity , @entity8 's @entity116			1
the charity exists to provide assistance to disabled and disadvantaged adults who dream of sailing			1
" it is difficult to do all the press , my diaphragm is in a bad way and i get tired easily with the interviews			0
but i want people to know my story because it 's important they realize disabled people can accomplish anything , given the right tools			1
" her own accomplishment she began last summer with the help of a support boat and a specially adapted motor home that she returned to after each day 's sailing to recuperate			2
last august she was forced to abandon the attempt due to bad weather and strong winds			0
she took up the gauntlet again in may and was rewarded with some transcendent moments			0
" when i was in the @entity143 i saw something that looked like a blow hole on my starboard side , " she said			0
" i was n't sure what i 'd seen then suddenly out of the water this huge whale emerged like an exocet missile			0
next thing a pod of them -- we think they were humpbacks -- were all around my boat			0
" i remember thinking , ' i wonder if this is safe ' but i was enjoying the moment so much			0
