-- there are several reasons why @entity5 's @entity4 - winning novel " @entity3 " was considered unfilmable when it was published in 2001			1
that most of the story takes place on a lifeboat in the middle of the @entity10 surely did n't help			0
that the shipwrecked hero , a young @entity12 boy named @entity13 -- " @entity3 " for short -- did n't have another human soul to talk to for 200 days presented another significant challenge			1
but the most glaring problem facing any aspiring filmmaker would have to be @entity19 , the full - grown 450 - pound bengal tiger who shares the lifeboat with @entity3			1
well , it 's amazing what they can do with special effects these days : @entity19 is such a fabulous and fully realized creation , perhaps nothing is unfilmable now ? we do n't usually think of " @entity29 " director @entity28 as an effects filmmaker , but he gave us the romantic swordplay above swaying bamboo forests in " @entity33 " and , less happily , " @entity34 " bouncing across the desert like a rubber ball			1
here he 's embraced @entity37 , and it 's a masterstroke			0
the slightly artificial quality that comes with this technology -- even wearing the spectacles puts a barrier between the movie and reality -- complements @entity3 's magical realist yarn , and @entity46 's luminous , glossy , color - saturated cinematography gives the movie a picture book look			1
no surprise , really , that @entity37 is ideally suited to lunging tigers and pitching sea			0
but it 's more than that			0
in this story @entity3 must remain acutely aware of distance : the distance between him and the big cat , the restricted space of the lifeboat , and the overwhelming open horizons of the ocean all around him			1
some of the loveliest , most magical images plunge beneath the surface to reveal the myriad marine creatures separated from @entity3 by nothing more than an inch or two of wood			2
and , at night , the water reflecting the deep glimmering stars			0
this is stereoscopic @entity74 image - making as pure visual poetry , a demonstration of what the medium can do in the right hands that is worthy of comparison with " @entity81 " and " @entity82			0
" so how does @entity3 find himself in this unusual predicament ? that 's prosaic in comparison , and the first act is not quite as nimble as it might have been ( there 's a necessary framing device , but also a redundant romantic interlude concocted by screenwriter @entity90 for reasons that have more to do with conventional @entity93 wisdom than the demands of this particular tale )			2
it 's only when @entity3 's world is turned upside down that the film really finds its sea legs			1
interesting to note that the movie revises and pretty much demolishes the tiger - taming tips @entity5 came up with -- worth bearing in mind should you ever find yourself in close proximity to a man - eater for a prolonged period of time			1
the movie 's @entity3 ( @entity109 ) is considerably more circumspect than the novel 's , and understandably so -- @entity19 is more ferocious in the flesh than he was on the page			2
the tension is welcome and also a discreet approach to violence which should make the movie accessible to children			0
even then , to his credit , @entity28 is never tempted to domesticate this cat , except briefly , when both boy and beast are starving and at death 's door			1
it 's at this point that the movie conjures its most surreal and outlandish episode , an alluring strange interlude on a floating island that does n't quite catch the horror in the novel 's description			0
if this climax feels a shade hurried , the poignant coda is written and acted with immense delicacy by @entity137 and @entity138			0
this transcendent fable carries a real sting in its tail			0
@entity28 has made a bold and wondrous movie , one of his best .			2
