-- there 's yet another way to post writing and photos and share them with other people online			0
medium is a new blogging tool for people who feel constrained by @entity10 and overwhelmed by @entity11 or @entity12			1
currently only in preview mode , the project is getting attention because of its founders ' impressive pedigree			0
@entity18 and @entity19 co-founded @entity10 and @entity11 , so they know about blogging , both long and short form			1
medium is the latest product out of their @entity10 , which incubated @entity10 in its early days , and the duo has a grand vision for the blogging tool , elucidated in a long announcement post by @entity18			1
" we 're re-imagining publishing in an attempt to make an evolutionary leap , based on everything we 've learned in the last 13 years and the needs of today 's world , " says @entity18 in the post			0
for a project that is " rethinking " publishing , the first go is a blogging platform that recycles many of the best features already at work on other sites -- @entity45 , @entity12 , @entity11 , @entity46 -- and ties it heavily into @entity10			1
the design is like a minimalist @entity12 or @entity50 theme			2
posts can be just a large photo , words or a combination			2
they are organized into collections , like @entity45 , and can be sorted by popularity based on votes from the community , like @entity46 and @entity60 ( there 's also an option to view by newest first )			1
clicking on a person 's name does n't take you to a landing page that shows you all their posts			2
rather , you 're whisked away to their @entity10 profile , where you can scan for links to medium posts they 've created			1
perhaps following specific people is n't the point of medium ; at its heart are the collections which allow you to explore content by topic			2
current collections include the photo - based " when i was a kid , " a bunch of first - person stories titled " this happened to me " and " @entity88 , " a selection of editorial pieces on everything from @entity92 to socialism			0
the goal of @entity75 does n't appear to be revolutionizing how content is shared , but to boost the quality of the content itself , according to its founders			0
" lots of services have successfully lowered the bar for sharing information , but there 's been less progress toward raising the quality of what 's produced , " says @entity18			0
medium gives people space to go deeper than is allowed by @entity10 's 140 - character limit , but there 's no pressure to post regularly or have a branded presence			1
voting and collections put the emphasis on surfacing the best content from a mass of people , organizing them into subject - oriented pages like sections of a newspaper			0
users can wax poetic about their hopes and dreams " without the burden of becoming a blogger or worrying about developing an audience , " says @entity18			0
posting privileges are limited to a chosen few for the time being , but anyone can make an account , using their @entity10 handle , to browse and vote on posts			1
the first incarnation of medium seems familiar and a little mundane , but hopefully it 's just a starting point for this team of experienced blogging and content veterans			2
" we 're just starting the journey of figuring out what all that means , and what we 're releasing today is just a sliver of what we 've figured out , " said @entity18 .			0
