" the jury began deliberating thursday and returned its verdict friday morning			2

" prosecutors plan to try another executive separately			2
asked if the @entity39 plans to appeal , department spokesman @entity56 said , " i would n't want to comment on that			0
" federal prosecutors had accused the mining company and its executives of exposing @entity7 's 100,000 residents to asbestos for decades , resulting in more than 200 deaths and 1,000 illnesses			1
the product covered patches of grass , dusted the tops of cars and drifted through the air in a hazy smoke that became a part of residents ' daily lives			2
" there 's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime , " said @entity75 in an april interview			2

during the trial , those who lost loved ones testified at the federal courthouse in @entity87 , about 130 miles southeast of @entity7 , that residents had been kept in the dark about the dangers			1
until 1990 , @entity2 operated a mine in @entity7 that produced vermiculite , a substance used in all sorts of products , from insulation to fertilizers			0
the vermiculite was contaminated with tremolite asbestos -- linked to numerous illnesses including mesothelioma , a cancer that can attack the lining of the lungs , abdomen or heart			2
the government 's indictment alleged that @entity11 conspired to " knowingly release " the asbestos			1
it said the company tried to hide the dangers from employees and residents , leaving them " in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury			1
" " it was a purpose of the conspiracy to conceal and misrepresent the hazardous nature of the tremolite asbestos contaminated vermiculite , thereby enriching defendants and others , " the indictment read			0
the indictment also said @entity11 tried to " defraud the @entity127 and others by impairing , impeding , and frustrating " the @entity129 and other government agencies once they launched an investigation in 1999			1
the 10 - count indictment included charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice			0
had it been convicted , the company could have faced criminal fines of up to $ 280 million , which is twice the value of its profits from the mine			0
grace executives , who were named as defendants , could have faced prison time			0
the company did not deny that asbestos emanated from its plant			1
nor did it question that some people had been sickened and killed , though a definitive number of deaths linked to the vermiculite plant probably will never be known			0
but @entity11 denied any kind of conspiracy			1
in fact , the company said , it acted responsibly and took appropriate steps			1
it said it had voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 @entity7 residents			1
in the courtroom , defense attorneys noted that the asbestos problem dates back to about 1920 , long before @entity11 took over the mine in 1963			1
the attorneys said that , as information about the asbestos came to light , the company took numerous steps to mitigate the dangers and were open about it			1
defense attorney @entity175 said he was not surprised by the verdict			0
" the evidence showed that what was going on internally with the company was anything but conspiratorial , " he told said			0
" however , some townspeople did not share @entity175 's view			0
" i do n't see how they could have gotten out of it , " said @entity184 , who worked at the mine for 17 years until it closed in 1990			0
shortly afterward , @entity184 was diagnosed with asbestosis , a lung disease caused by exposure to asbestos fibers			2
the 60 - year - old retiree said he told his managers in the late 1980s that he was concerned to find that tremolite is a form of asbestos			0
" they said , ' oh , yeah , but it 's the short - fiber type that wo n't hurt you , ' " he said			0
@entity184 settled with the company for a " small amount , " he told @entity0 friday in a telephone interview			0
