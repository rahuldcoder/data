-- @entity2 chief executive @entity1 has told @entity3 that there is no chance of the top @entity7 clubs forming a breakaway league to rival the @entity9			1
the possibility of a breakaway league has been mooted for several years and earlier this week @entity13 president @entity12 suggested that @entity9 matches should be played at the weekend , with the top @entity7 leagues all being reduced to 16 teams to accommodate the fixtures			1
however , speaking exclusively to @entity3 's @entity18 , @entity1 rejected any such notions and insisted that the @entity9 will remain a midweek competition			1
" a breakaway league is just not going to happen , " said @entity1			1
" what has been said has been said but i 'm not going to go along with the sentiment			0
" in reality we have a @entity9 , it 's a fantastic competition			0
obviously there are some things the clubs would like to alter and ultimately discussions will take place and @entity32 will do something to make sure things stay intact			0
" @entity1 added : " but when it comes to ultimate football sanctions you just ca n't break away			2
the only reason the @entity2 was formed was because it had the permission of our @entity40			2
" they are the ultimate arbiters of football in this country and for anyone else to go and play unsanctioned competitions is unthinkable			0
@entity32 would have to agree with what happened , so the idea that anybody in football can just break away and do what they want is just impossible			0
" and speaking specifically about @entity12 's comments , @entity1 continued : " what he said was from a @entity13 - centric view			1
" our clubs will not be playing @entity7 football on a weekend			1
@entity7 football is a midweek competition , and domestic football is a weekend competition			1
" with six of the current top eight @entity2 clubs now under foreign ownership , there has been talk the league might go the same way as @entity71 sport , with a franchise system and no promotion and relegation			1
however , @entity1 was quick to dispel any fears of this , saying : " it does n't matter to us whether the owners are foreign or @entity80 , what matters to us is how they run their clubs			2
" this idea that everyone who is a @entity80 owner is sat somewhere in a members club with these eight or nine other foreign owners , somehow with a common view , is nonsensical			0
" he added : " the one thing i ca n't see changing is promotion and relegation			0
that 's the lifeblood of the whole league			2
" last season @entity93 were bottom but they still ended up defeating @entity95 -- and there is no other league in the world when the bottom teams can be competitive with the top			0
it 's because they have to fight to avoid relegation			0
