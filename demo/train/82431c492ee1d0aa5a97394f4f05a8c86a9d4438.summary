-- if trials were predictable , they would n't happen			2
you can root for a jury to see a case your way and disagree with its ultimate verdict , but you can not criticize the jury system for being unpredictable			1
in that sense , a @entity12 jury 's recent verdicts -- and nonverdicts -- against @entity14 demonstrate a fundamental truth about trials			1
they are not only unpredictable ; they are designed that way			2
the case against @entity14 stemmed from an incident on november 23 , 2012			1
@entity14 , a 47 - year - old white man , arrived at a gas station in @entity24 , @entity12 , and parked next to an suv that contained @entity26 and other black teenagers			1
when @entity14 complained about loud music coming from the suv , words were exchanged and @entity14 ultimately fired a gun that killed @entity26			1
@entity14 said he saw a gun barrel pointing out of the suv , but the prosecution said there was no gun			1
@entity14 was found guilty of three counts of attempted second - degree murder as to the other occupants of the car , but the jury was not able to reach a verdict on the first - degree murder charge in the death of @entity26			1
in the eyes of critics , this case was a " sure thing " for the prosecution , and anything less than guilty verdicts across the board is now considered by them to be a miscarriage of justice			1
that sentiment belies a fundamental misunderstanding about the criminal justice system : with juries , there is no such thing as a " sure thing			0
" no one can accurately predict how each juror might perceive the evidence , argue a case in deliberations or be persuaded by his or her fellow jurors			0
jurors can and do bring their own life experiences to the jury room , and no two jurors are the same			2
yet anyone who has waited for a jury 's verdict has engaged in the same helpless jury astrology because there is simply no hard science to predict their behavior			1
the best example is the rabid divination of the meaning of juror questions : those inscrutable , handwritten missives intermittently sent out to the judge and read to the lawyers in chambers			2
@entity89 : an empty verdict , a hollow victory this system is about as sophisticated as note - passing in grade - school algebra , but just a few lines from an innocuous jury inquiry will leave seasoned attorneys pondering the hidden meaning and the potential direction of the deliberations			1
the bottom line is this : reading these tea leaves is an exercise in futility			0
there 's no way to predict a verdict with certainty			1
to many observers , including me , this was a strong prosecution case , but not a sure thing			2
in fact , it 's generally only the close - call cases that go to a jury			1
the most obvious cases of guilt or nonguilt should result in plea agreements or voluntary withdrawals by the prosecution			0
simply look at the statistics			0
the vast majority of all cases , criminal and civil , are resolved before trial			0
verdicts are simply too risky for either side , especially to put up a case that they believe is a loser			0
a jury trial means each side believes their theory of the case is strong enough to roll the dice in this riskiest game of all			0
whether you agree with the jury 's verdict or not , these verdicts give us some insight into the jury 's thought process			1
the jury convicted on attempted second - degree murder for shots fired at the other passengers in the suv with @entity26			0
by @entity14 's own concessions , he intentionally shot at a vehicle speeding away from him			1
even if @entity14 's testimony were completely believed , at best only @entity26 was the aggressor , so @entity14 had a minimal self - defense claim against the other occupants			1
but , the verdict on attempted second - degree murder may have put a figurative " cap " on @entity14 's level of intent			1
in other words , the jury may have agreed that @entity14 's level of intent as to all victims was consistent -- perhaps not the specific intent to kill characteristic of a first - degree murder , but something slightly less			1
in the case of second - degree murder , this could be an intentional act so indifferent to human life it evinced a depraved mind			0
the " depraved heart " variety of murder is often analogized , coincidentally enough , to law students as closing your eyes and shooting into a crowd with a gun			0
it may be true that you did not actually intend to hit anyone , but the act was so likely to kill that your level of intent is just below that of specific , premeditated murder			0
that law school example used to explain the concept to students is eerily similar to the facts here			0
while it 's possible that the jury was hung up trying to apply the law of self - defense , it may also be that the jury simply had trouble with the definitions of homicide			1
they are complicated for lawyers and lay persons alike			0
@entity12 's standard jury instructions are available online			2
take a look at each of the suggested instructions for the different degrees of murder and manslaughter			0
they , like all jury instructions , are complicated			0
they do not get much less complicated just because the judge reads them slowly and out loud to the jury			0
they involve abstract concepts and seemingly overlapping definitions of nuanced " states of mind			0
" it 's very likely that the jury was hung up on whether self - defense applied , but they also may have deadlocked over the different definitions of homicide			1
despite public frustrations , this was a win for the prosecution			1
it secured a successful verdict on four of five counts that will , because of @entity12 's minimum mandatory sentencing scheme and the defendant 's use of a firearm , send @entity14 to prison for at least 60 to 75 years			1
that 's day - for - day : no gain time , no early release except for a win on appeal			2
plus , the prosecution can retry @entity14 for the killing of @entity26			1
when a judge discharges a jury on the grounds that the jury can not reach a verdict , the double jeopardy clause of the @entity253 to the @entity254 does not bar a new trial of the defendant			2
the double jeopardy clause provides : " [ @entity263 ] or shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb in criminal ... cases			0
" if the state reprosecutes the @entity26 killing , @entity14 will certainly feel as if he 's being tried twice for the same crime			1
constitutionally , however , a retrial following a deadlocked jury is permissible			0
defense counsel deserves recognition as well			0
they hung a jury on what many observers expected to be a clear - cut murder conviction			0
even without the wave of public acrimony against the defendant , this was always an uphill self - defense case			0
it was clear from the trial that the defense prepared this case and the client , and gave @entity14 the best chance at a not - guilty verdict			1
overall , a good job with bad facts for the defense			0
the big question now is whether we will see the state of @entity12 retry @entity14 for the murder of @entity26			2
on one hand , they have achieved a virtual life sentence on the other convictions , which achieves one of the philosophical goals of punishment : incapacitation and isolation of @entity14 from the community			2
it does not achieve another goal of punishment for the @entity26 family : retribution			0
the state has indicated for now that it will retry @entity14 , but if it does , one thing will remain certain : there are no sure things in retrials , either			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity322 .			2

@entity322 : critics of the @entity14 verdict miss a feature of trials
they *'re* always unpredictable , and it 's *impossible* to get inside the mind of a jury , he says
he says jury may have been unsure about meaning of various degrees of homicide
@entity322 : the prosecution scored a win , despite public criticism of the verdict
