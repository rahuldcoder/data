@entity0 -- the next phase of @entity4 's complex elections process continues monday , with runoff races pitting candidates vying to join the lower house of parliament			1
the two - day vote -- which continues into tuesday -- comes exactly a week after @entity4 cast ballots for the first time since last february 's toppling of long - time president @entity13			1
that vote ended with moderate and more conservative @entity15 parties together winning big and earning a majority of seats within the new parliament , called the @entity19			2
such results appear to mirror recent victories by moderate @entity15 in fellow @entity24 nations @entity22 and @entity25			0
presidential candidate @entity26 , a former @entity4 foreign minister and @entity27 secretary - general , told @entity1 on sunday that he expected this week 's runoff to change the final mix of parties in the legislative chamber			1
still , he suggested that already the announced results should serve as a wake - up call to more liberal and sectarian factions within @entity4			1
" the ... final results , i believe , will be more balanced , " predicted @entity26 of the upcoming election			2
" ( still ) , this is a message to the liberal forces that they have to come together and ... mobilize themselves in order to create a strong opposition within the parliament			0
" last week , @entity4 could cast three votes : two for independent candidates and one for a party or coalition			2
four independent candidates secured seats , including @entity50 , once a research director at the @entity52 and a spokesman of the " @entity54 " that worked to foster negotiations between the government and anti-government protesters earlier this year			0
but other positions in parliament remain in limbo because no candidate won clear majorities , leading to this week 's runoff			1
it 's all part of a multi-step process set up that will shape the makeup of @entity4 's legislature and government going forward			1
the last step takes place in june with presidential elections , according to military leaders who have in effect ruled the country since @entity13 's fall			0
one hot topic that will face the new government is how to handle @entity4 's currently peaceful arrangement with @entity79			1
under @entity13 and his secular government , @entity4 and @entity79 forged agreements that have resulted in peace and economic cooperation between the two nations			1
but the successes of @entity15 in elections , to date , have raised the specter that major changes , and perhaps rising tensions , could be on the horizon			0
the relatively moderate @entity91 's @entity92 won 40 % in the first round of voting for the lower house of parliament , according to @entity97 , head of the executive office of the @entity99			1
the second highest total , at 20 % , went to members of the @entity102 , a hard - line muslim group			0
speaking to his nation 's @entity104 on sunday , @entity79 defense minister @entity103 called the @entity4 vote results so far " very troubling			1
" prime minister @entity107 added sunday -- while participating in an annual state memorial service for @entity109 , @entity79 's first prime minister -- that both countries would be best served by not significantly altering their relationship			0
" i hope that whichever government takes power in @entity4 would recognize the importance of maintaining the peace agreement with @entity79 , " he said			2
" there is an importance in recognizing the peace with @entity79 , both as a value of its own and as a basis for the financial and security stability of the region			0
" but @entity26 said that change may be inevitable , given that " the @entity125 of last year is ... gone for good			0
" he claimed it should be no surprise that a " new @entity27 world " would want a " new set of relations , " stressing that @entity79 will more likely have positive relationships with its neighbors once it ends its " occupation " of @entity135 territories			1
" the @entity79 must sit now and reflect			0
@entity4 is no ( longer ) the @entity4 they knew ( and ) the other neighbors are not the same and will not be the same , " @entity26 said			2
" there is a window of opportunity for all of us to solve the problems and move on in a totally new era , including @entity79			0
" @entity1 's @entity144 and @entity145 and journalist @entity146 contributed to this report .			0

a two - day runoff starts monday for remaining seats in @entity4 's parliament
*islamist* parties did very well in the first round of voting , held last week
@entity79 leaders call results so far " troubling , " say @entity4 should *n't* alter its relations
@entity26 says it 's expected a " new @entity27 world " wants a " new set of relations "
