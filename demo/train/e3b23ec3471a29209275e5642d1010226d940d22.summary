@entity0 , @entity1 -- late one night , after dark , we met up with @entity4 -- head of @entity5 , an ngo fighting child prostitution -- to go behind the scenes at @entity1 's @entity8 : karaoke clubs that are fronts for brothels			1
i threw on some jeans and tried to look like a tourist who was up for a kinky kind of tour , with my ersatz " boyfriend " -- our cameraman , @entity13			1
@entity4 drove us first to an out of the way small side street , where there were tiny @entity21 operating out in the open like cheap brothels			1
girls sat on plastic chairs lining the entrance , all painted up and wearing short skirts , high heels and fake smiles			1
we walked past a few , stopping to talk for a little while			1
the girls would stand up , becoming energized and engaged			1
we crossed the street and approached another one , as if we were sampling the wares at each one			1
we walk into a @entity8 ; @entity13 and @entity4 lead the way into the karaoke rooms			1
i become less nervous as we walk to the back where an overweight young woman frantically sweeps the kitchen floor , and we are pointed up some cement and metal stairs			1
we pass hallways full of closed doors , in which i can only imagine the sex acts occur			1
we are brought into a low ceilinged , dank room with some disgusting couches and a video screen on one wall			1
i am overwhelmed with the saturated smell of air freshener that apparently has gone off like an insect fogger in this room -- to cover what odor , who knows			2
i nearly gag and we beat a quick path out of there			2
we hop back into the car and head off			2
next stop : a famous 5 - storied fortress of a ktv with armed guards outside			2
@entity4 says if we take the elevator up from the basement , we can skip the bar and go straight to the " massage " floor			2
on the fifth floor we are immediately led to a giant windowed " fishbowl " where at least 20 girls sit on bleacher to be observed and picked			1
@entity13 walks in front of the pane ; they respond to his macho energy , rising and preening			2
i have my @entity78 in hand and itching to take a picture when suddenly things go horribly sideways : a white - clad girl in the bowl suddenly jumps up and starts screaming " she take a picture ! ! " she runs into the lobby and a grim - faced @entity87 up to us			2
the girl crowds us and accuses me ; more people start to gather			2
my friends advise me to erase the picture -- but i have n't taken any ! i try and stand my ground and keep saying , " i did n't take a picture			2
" but i am becoming very nervous and the situation is getting ugly			2
we hustle back onto the elevator			2
we were lucky to get out of there without running into the security guys , because there could have been real trouble			2
but their behavior absolutely cemented the fact that something illegal , beyond legal - aged prostitution is going on there			1
they were acting like they had far too much to lose			0
we head to another @entity8 , this one still upscale but less fortress - like than the last			0
paintings of the cosmos line the ceiling in the lobby			0
we were ushered in and led us upstairs to karaoke room where hostesses in satin , beaded formal dresses greet us			1
the large and comfortable room had a giant screen on one wall and couches lining the other three walls			0
colored lights pulse and change on the walls			0
an older woman walked in five girls dressed in fairly classy though sexy business suits , for us to take our pick of whom we would like to stay with us			1
@entity13 , fully playing the part , roars out in his @entity132 accent , " you have anything younger , fresher ? ! " the girls scurry out in a hurry			1
they are also more provocatively dressed ; they are wearing very short little black dresses			0
@entity4 picks one , and so does @entity13 and the two join us ; the karaoke starts in earnest			1
i must sing with gusto to justify my presence , otherwise what is this white lady doing here ? we sit there and begin to get their life stories			1
the young girl sitting next to me , the one @entity13 chose , is extremely pretty			0
it is impossible to tell how old she is -- she claims to be 21 , i would believe it if she was 14			0
she says she does n't come from @entity0 , and she is working here because her family is very poor and needs the money			1
her family does n't know what kind of work she is doing , she said			0
if they find out , they will be angry with her			0
she has a very pretty smile , but there are moments when i watch her where the smile disappears , and she looks very sad			0
she chooses to sing a song from the karaoke catalog , a popular dance hit in @entity171 , which has a video of a singer performing in front of what looks to be an @entity178 style high school dance , again like a prom			1
i am told the song is called " only one virginity " ( ! ) and it talks about how a girl is like a flower , and only has the one time where she has most value			0
our young acquaintance sings her heart out , very intently performing if not always tunefully			0
afterwards she tells me that she very specifically picked this one out , and that she wishes that she will meet a man that will go to her parents and ask for her hand , respect her			0
i try to get her to talk about what men expect from her here , but it does n't go very far			0
i see that @entity4 has been very busy with the girl he invited to stay , showing her a video on his @entity78 in which a girl from his center talks about how she was able to leave a @entity8 and now has a job that she is excited about and is much happier			0
she was very intrigued by the video and she gave him her cellphone number so the girl from the video could call her and follow up			0
i passed his iphone to our young companion			0
thankfully , the hostesses did not seem to mind or care that we were doing this ; the whole room was on security cameras poised in the corners but no one came in and stopped us			0
she watched and listened to the video very intently			0
afterwards she said she liked it			0
" i know it is hard to trust us , strangers , " i told her			0
" but i am a mom ( and i showed her pictures of my four happy children and me hugging my two daughters ) and i would n't want my kids in a situation like this			0
" she did n't give her number , but we told her it was okay , @entity4 's outreach person would call her friend and we gave her @entity4 's card			1
i impressed on her that this was opportunity knocking on her door , and she should answer it : this was her chance for a happier life			1
we hugged goodbye , and went back to the cars			0
i had no idea that i was going to be involved in trying to recruit girls to leave the @entity8 life and receive the services of @entity244			1

@entity246 takes a behind the scenes look at @entity1 's child sex trade
karaoke bars are often fronts for prostitution in @entity0 , the *country* 's *capital*
when a club hostess is asked to bring in younger girls , she *obliges*
girls are shown *messages* from others who escaped life from these covert brothels
