-- it 's a blog where people post , and make fun of , pictures of out - of - shape , poorly dressed and otherwise awkward people shopping at @entity7			1
the " @entity9 " blog features photos taken by users at the mega-chain			1
and , in less than a month , with no marketing to speak of , it 's become the toast of the @entity16			0
" people of @entity7 , " a gag started by two 20 - something brothers and their buddy to share crazy pictures with their friends , has gone viral			1
promoted largely on sites like @entity24 and @entity25 -- and linked ad nauseam on @entity27 and @entity28 -- the site picked up enough traffic to crash its servers on wednesday			0
" i 'm still baffled -- i really am , " said @entity33 , 23 , one of the creators of the site , who said his team was frantically working wednesday to add enough server space to handle the surge in traffic			1
photos on the site , sent in by viewers all over the @entity42 , frequently feature overweight people wearing tight clothes , bizarre hairstyles ( with versions of the short - in - front , long - in - back " mullet " leading the pack ) and fashion crimes ranging from furry leg warmers to miniskirts that leave absolutely nothing to the imagination			1
there 's a guy enjoying a can of beer outside a @entity7 , a guy dressed as @entity60 and another guy with a goat			1
yes , a live goat			0
@entity33 and his brother @entity64 , 25 , said they thought of the site after a visit to a @entity68 @entity7 where they saw a woman they believed to be a stripper , wearing an obscene t - shirt and leading a toddler in a harness			1
around the next corner was a man with a beard reminiscent of the rock band @entity78			0
" it 's kind of like the light bulb went off , " @entity33 said			0
" we get the e-mails already from people who are like , ' why did n't i think of this ? ' we just happened to be fortunate enough to have the ability to actually follow through on it			1
" their site was keeping up when it was getting about 500,000 views a day , but got swamped by a new spike in traffic late last week			2
the brothers , along with partner @entity92 , 23 , say response has been largely positive -- with only a handful of complaints out of every 100 e-mails they get			0
a post on the group 's @entity27 page thursday morning said they had gotten more than 1.2 million page views on wednesday , even though the site was down for much of the day			2
the site was getting two or three photo submissions a day until last week they said -- when all of a sudden hundreds of e-mails , most with pictures , started rolling in			2
but not everyone appreciates the humor -- saying the site goes out of its way to mock poor and rural patrons of the store , reinforcing stereotypes along the way			1
" @entity42 culture likes to single out people who appear to be different , " said @entity117 , vice president of the @entity119 , @entity120 - based @entity118			0
" whether it 's a joke or not , all depends on which side of the camera you 're on			0
" furthering stereotypes can strengthen the rifts between rural , urban and suburban residents and , in the worst - case scenario , can affect the way some people are treated by government and industry , he said			2
@entity7 , the world 's largest retailer with more than 4,200 @entity42 stores and over $ 400 billion in annual sales , may be more prominent in rural areas , @entity117 said , but to use that to stereotype its shoppers does n't make sense			1
" the reality is that everybody shops at @entity7 , " he said			2
" if you want to find the guy in the golf shirt and khakis , he 's there too			0
" a spokesman for @entity7 declined to comment for this story			2
the brothers say they do n't mean for their site to be mean - spirited , and that they have standards for which photos they use			1
@entity33 said they do n't include pictures of people with physical disabilities or apparent mental disabilities and wo n't run a picture of a person simply because they are overweight			1
" we 're not going to go out and say we 're not making fun of anybody or we 're the nicest guys in the world			0
but i think you have to draw a line somewhere when you have a site like this , " he said			0
" if you have a mental handicap -- that 's not funny			0
if you have lost a leg and you 're on a crutch or in a wheelchair , some people may laugh at that , but we do n't find it funny			2
" he denied complaints that the photos -- many of which attract a string of snarky comments from readers -- single out people because they are poor or unattractive			2
" if you make a bad decision on what you 're going to be out in public wearing , that 's what we 're looking for , " he said			0
" if you 're 400 pounds , you should n't be wearing nothing but a pink tube top			0
even if you shop at @entity198 , wherever you go , the shirts they sell have sleeves and they have your size			0
" @entity201 , who works as a web designer for a marketing firm , said he and his brother are frequent @entity7 shoppers themselves and that , in a way , their site could be boon to the shopping chain			1
" people [ who send e-mails wanting to take pictures ] say , ' i have n't been to @entity7 in years , but now i have a reason to go , ' " he said .			1
