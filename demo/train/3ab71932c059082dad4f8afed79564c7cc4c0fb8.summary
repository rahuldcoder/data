-- @entity1 has lost only four matches this year -- and the world no. 1 is hoping her most recent setback can help her become the oldest winner of a @entity8 women 's singles title			1
the @entity9 is favored for a fifth triumph at @entity11 , but this month 's defeat by second - ranked @entity13 has given the @entity15 hope of avenging last year 's final heartbreak			1
@entity13 served for the title just under 12 months ago in @entity18 , but @entity1 fought back to claim her 15th grand slam title			1
she has since added another , at the @entity21 in june , but suffered a shock reverse against @entity23 in the last 16 at @entity24			0
@entity1 added two more @entity26 titles at @entity27 and @entity28 , but was upset by @entity13 in a third - set tie - breaker in the @entity31 final			1
" every time i lose , i get so pumped afterwards , " said @entity1 at a pre-tournament press conference saturday			2
" i just feel like now i 'm ready , now i 'm prepared			0
i almost needed that to take my game to a new level			0
" @entity1 will be 32 on september 26 , and if she can retain her title in the final 18 days before that then she will surpass @entity40 's 1973 effort of being the tournament 's oldest woman winner			1
" i have been able to keep up with the times , " @entity1 said			2
" i 'm actually serving harder than i ever have in my career			0
the racquets are stronger and i 'm more fit			0
" i feel so good , so healthy , so vivacious every time i step on the court			0
" with world no. 3 @entity48 missing the tournament due to injury , and @entity24 champion @entity52 having retired earlier this month , @entity13 is @entity1 ' biggest threat along with @entity55 third seed @entity54			1
@entity1 will face former @entity21 winner @entity56 in her opening match monday , while older sister @entity58 plays @entity60 's @entity24 semifinalist @entity59			2
@entity13 will begin the two - week event against @entity64 's grand slam debutant @entity62			1
" you can always take the best out of what happened last week , so i will definitely take that into consideration , " the 24 - year - old told reporters saturday			0
" but the new week , @entity8 , @entity1 , number one player in the world , defending champion , we all start kind of from zero here			2
" in the men 's draw , @entity75 and @entity76 will both be in action on monday			0
second - ranked @entity75 will face @entity9 @entity80 as he bids to win the hard - court event for the second time			0
the @entity83 was champion in 2011 , then runner - up the following year , but missed the 2012 event due to injury			0
@entity76 , the champion five years in a row from 2004 , will play @entity89 's @entity88 as the seventh seed following a difficult year in which the 17 - time grand slam winner has struggled with both injuries and an experiment with a new racquet			1
meanwhile , world no. 9 @entity97 's @entity8 preparations stumbled saturday as the @entity99 lost 6 - 2 6 - 2 to @entity101 's @entity100 in the final of the @entity26 event in @entity104			1
@entity100 , a quarterfinalist in @entity31 , followed up friday 's win over former no. 1 @entity107 to claim her fourth title this year			1
@entity110 's @entity109 may miss @entity18 after suffering an abdominal injury in the final of the @entity115 's @entity114 tournament			0
the former world no. 7 , now ranked 49th after a series of physical setbacks , retired at 6 - 3 2 - 1 down against @entity120 's @entity119 .			2

@entity1 will begin defense of her @entity8 title on monday
world no. 1 is *seeking* to become the grand slam 's oldest women 's champion
@entity9 says she is determined to *bounce* back from recent @entity31 defeat
her main rival will be last year 's beaten finalist @entity13
