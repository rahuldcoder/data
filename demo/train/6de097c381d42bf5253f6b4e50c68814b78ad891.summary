@entity0 -- for all the recent scaremongering about the viability of an independent @entity5 , it 's easy to understand why the chance to reclaim a country 's sovereignty offers its citizens an exciting prospect			1
@entity5 is , after all , culturally distinct from the rest of the @entity12			0
and for those @entity5 aged 16 and 17 , who will be given the vote for the first time , the opportunity of creating their own @entity5 identity after three centuries of largely @entity18 rule must certainly have its own idealistic appeal			0
but @entity5 's bid for freedom will ultimately come down to money -- namely which currency it would use as an independent country			1
@entity5 has four options -- each with their own risks and unknowns			1
those who want the country to vote " yes " for independence have made clear they wish to keep the pound with the @entity35 's blessing , in a move that would keep the nation inside a stable currency union and also give it a say on interest rates			1
however this idea has been staunchly rejected by both the @entity12 government and the @entity43 , which presumably would be loath to backstop @entity5 's massive banks without having a say on their loan books			1
a separate @entity5 could use the @entity35 's currency without its consent -- much in the way that @entity51 employs the @entity53 dollar and similar to how @entity54 once pegged itself to the pound			1
but this strategy could be fraught with dangers			0
why ? because @entity5 would have no say over borrowing costs that might be out of step with its economic cycle			0
if @entity5 ca n't keep its place in its existing monetary bloc , it could try to find a place in another one			0
if the country goes it alone , it can sign up for the euro but @entity68 has made it clear that @entity5 would have to apply for @entity71 membership first , joining the queue behind places like @entity74 and @entity75			2
moreover , independence agitators in @entity78 's semi-autonomous provinces like @entity79 would n't make @entity80 look favorably on giving @entity5 a spot inside the @entity71			2
and -- given the pain we 've seen in countries like @entity78 -- no one knows if the euro will still be around by the time that @entity5 does eventually make it into the club			1
perhaps the best option for a prosperous @entity5 , in the long run , would be the creation of its own currency			2
suggestions that have been put forward include reviving the @entity94 -- a coin struck to commemorate @entity97 ' marriage -- or reintroducing the @entity98 , in circulation during @entity101 's time			0
having their own money would n't just give the @entity5 the full independent identity they crave , it would also give them the financial flexibility a nascent state would need			0
still , establishing its worth would be tricky			0
what 's more , @entity5 people would have to be convinced of its true worth			2
and , with almost $ 200 billion of debt on the line , markets would have to be confident in the country 's fiscal planning to lend to it at decent rates			0
either way , the value of a new @entity5 currency would initially be extremely weak , hitting the people in the pocket first as goods get more expensive			2
which is why big names like the ratings agency @entity129 's and the @entity131 bank @entity130 have suggested that although a " yes " vote could create a successful @entity5 in the long term , for now , a swift , sharp recession could ensue			1
at least five major banks have drawn up contingency plans to move their legal entities south , with billions under management at stake			0
ironically money and politics are supposed to go hand in hand			0
but when it comes to the @entity5 's future as an independent land , they may have to go in opposite directions			1

@entity5 's bid for freedom will ultimately come down to which currency it would use , @entity159 writes
@entity5 has four options -- each with their own risks and unknowns
it could keep on using the pound -- with or without the @entity35 government 's blessing
it could also seek to join the euro or create its own currency
