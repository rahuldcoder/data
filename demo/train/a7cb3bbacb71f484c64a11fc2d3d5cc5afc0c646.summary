-- in december , @entity1 routinely lets users revisit the year by highlighting some their most popular posts and photos in an online scrapbook assembled in part from " likes " and comments			1
in the case of @entity11 , @entity1 's algorithm brought back painful memories -- and prompted the company to apologize			1
@entity11 , a web consultant , lost his 6 - year - old daughter , @entity14 , in june			1
when @entity1 showed him his suggested year in review , his late daughter 's photo was at the center			1
" yes , my year looked like that			2
my year looked like the now - absent face of my little girl , " @entity11 wrote in a @entity22 post on his blog			2
" it was still unkind to remind me so forcefully			0
" @entity11 did n't blame the algorithms ; they 're " essentially thoughtless , " he observed			1
but , he suggested , @entity1 's human side could have tempered their flaws			1
" where the human aspect fell short , at least with @entity1 , was in not providing a way to opt out			1
the @entity32 in review ad keeps coming up in my feed , rotating through different fun - and - fabulous backgrounds , as if celebrating a death , and there is no obvious way to stop it , " he wrote			0
" the design is for the ideal user , the happy , upbeat , good - life user			1
it does n't take other use cases into account			1
" @entity11 was n't the only one who was upset by the @entity32 in @entity47 's briskly automatic construction			1
other users chimed in on @entity49 with their displeasure			0
" wo n't be sharing my @entity32 in @entity47 , which ' highlights ' a post on a friend 's death in may despite words like ' killed ' and ' sad day , ' " wrote @entity57 's @entity56			2
" ( m ) y preview came up with my little boy & ' it 's been a great year , thanks for being a part of it ' he died at 15mos in nov , " wrote peitaballerina in response			0
@entity1 , which has created an " @entity71 " to help its employees think of users as , well , people , apologized to @entity11			1
" ( the app ) was awesome for a lot of people , but clearly in this case we brought him grief rather than joy , " year in review product manager @entity72 told the @entity73			0
" we can do better -- i 'm very grateful he took the time in his grief to write the blog post			0
" after his first post gained attention -- and invited a lot of unpleasant commentary -- @entity11 , in turn , apologized to the company in a compassionate follow - up			2
" i owe the @entity32 in review team in specific , and @entity1 in general , an apology			1
no , not the other way around , " he wrote			0
" i am very sorry that i dropped the internet on ( @entity72 's ) head for @entity22			0
he and his team did n't deserve it			2
" the solution , he adds , is n't to harp on the coders or designers , who often do n't fit the stereotypes commenters ascribed to them			2
it 's to " anticipate how a design decision that really worked in one way completely failed in another , and work to handle both cases , " he wrote			2
" this is such a common failure that it 's almost not a failure any more			0
it just ... is , " he added			0
" we need to challenge that ' is			0
' i 've fallen victim to it myself			0
it will take time , practice , and a whole lot of stumbling to figure out how to do better , but it is , i submit , vitally important that we do			0
