-- what is it about @entity4 music that enters our very souls , calms us and even gets us to do things that are right for humanity ? this music even has the ability to make us like our old @entity11			1
if there were a marketing campaign for @entity4 , it would be the most successful campaign ever devised			1
paintings of angels protecting sheep or a masterly rendition of the manger scene certainly evoke emotion			2
then there 's a good @entity4 story			1
in 1843 , @entity24 gave us " @entity26			2
" this literary gift had the power to make us actually give a farthing or two to the needy			0
however , it is music and song that has no rival in the ability to stir raw emotions			1
it does n't matter what your religious persuasion is			2
most people can recite and hum the @entity4 carols they 've heard repeatedly since childhood			1
among the most familiar are the pop songs : " @entity45 is coming to @entity46 , " which the @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 all performed ; @entity50 's " @entity51 " ; @entity52 's " @entity4 " ; and @entity53 's " @entity54			1
" then there 's one that the marketers made sure really goes for the heart -- " @entity59 " -- and the line , " if only in my dreams			0
" i forgot how lonely and depressed i was until i heard that song			0
the " home for @entity4 " notion originates during @entity65 , when @entity67 soldiers expected a quick victory , thinking they 'd be back in the @entity67 in time for the holidays			1
that was not the case , and the song was a huge hit decades later -- in 1943			0
speaking of hits , there 's " @entity78 " -- more than 500 different recordings were made of this song ; which was originally written for the movie " @entity77			0
" these songs conjure up old family photos of relatives here and long gone			1
we say , " oh my , look here 's an old tintype of @entity11 -- she was so kind and generous			0
" ( even if we never really liked her -- but then , it 's @entity4			1
) next up are the seasonal songs that really have little or nothing to do with the holiday			1
once again , those marketers have honed their skills at pulling our sentimental heartstrings			0
@entity93 singing " @entity94 ! let it snow ! let it snow ! " @entity98 and @entity99 doing " @entity97			0
" ( this song of trying to entice a young lady to stay was written for the film " @entity105 , " with @entity103 and @entity104			0
) @entity107 singing " @entity109 " in the 1944 film " @entity106 " and dozens more all have great images , and are all seasonal			2
did you know that " @entity119 " was originally titled " @entity119 " and was written in the late 1850s by @entity113 , to be performed during a @entity115 service at his unitarian church in @entity117 , @entity118 ? the congregation enjoyed it so much that it was repeated during @entity4 services , and " @entity119 " took off from there			1
of course , @entity4 is children			1
there are the novelty songs written for kids -- like the one about the most famous reindeer of all , @entity129			1
he came prancing into our lives when we were young with his shiny red nose and never left the roof			0
then there are @entity136 's " @entity137 " , @entity139 version of " @entity119 " and @entity140 and @entity142 's " @entity141			0
" songs only a kid could like			2
but my favorite has to be @entity148 's " @entity147			0
" and how about " @entity149 , " by @entity150 ? somebody please explain why anybody would buy that song			0
so here 's the question : what is this all about ? the emotional and often wonderful snapshots of our lives , past and present , all wrapped up for @entity4			1
have we been duped into loving this holiday ? absolutely not			2
i realized a while ago that indeed we all need a little @entity4			1
the security of home , family and friends is essential			1
so this marketing campaign that started with our first footsteps is fine -- we need it			0
is there a @entity45 ? have i been a good boy ? or , as @entity170 famously asked : do reindeer really know how to fly ? yes , of course , to all those questions			0
would n't it have been nice if those marketing guys figured out a way to make those 12 days of @entity4 last for the other 353 days of the year ? so deck the halls and please stop leaving @entity45 those fattening chocolate chip cookies -- he 's gained a lot of weight during the past 200 - plus years			2
and i say unto ye -- @entity181			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

@entity186 says nothing stirs emotions as powerfully as @entity4 songs do
he points out the various tunes : *classic* carols , religious music , silly songs for kids
" @entity186 " points out that many seasonal tunes have nothing to do with the holidays
@entity186 says magic of the holiday lies in the security of home , family , friends
