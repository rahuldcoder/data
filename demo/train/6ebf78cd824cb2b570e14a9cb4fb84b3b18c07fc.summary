despite @entity2 ' claims that they 're going to shorten the 2016 primary process , the contest is already under way			2
at the end of march , potential @entity2 presidential candidates @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 were among those who rushed to @entity11 to compete in the first primary for an all - important constituency of one : billionaire casino magnate @entity15			1
in 2012 , @entity15 and his wife , @entity16 , spent at least $ 93 million backing @entity17 , @entity18 and other @entity2 in their effort to defeat president @entity20 and @entity21 at every level			1
these candidates are all too eager to try to court and please the likes of @entity15 , who 's trying to buy the @entity25			1
but the problem 's not just that @entity15 is writing blank checks to the candidates of his choosing			1
the problem is that @entity15 and other super-wealthy @entity2 donors are directing their largesse to buy elected officials who support policies that benefit their bottom lines at the expense of middle - class @entity38 families			1
people like @entity15 support candidates who are in favor of lowering tax rates for corporations and the super-wealthy -- people like @entity15			1
but those tax giveaways are n't free			2
rep. @entity48 's @entity25 @entity2 budget pays for those tax breaks by gutting funding for investments in education and infrastructure , ending @entity54 as we know it , and raising taxes on middle - class families with children			2
the billionaire brothers @entity60 and @entity61 and their allies have given hundreds of millions of dollars in support of @entity2 candidates and causes			1
and their focus is n't limited to the @entity25 , or even @entity25 and @entity68 seats			2
they 're opening their checkbook to tip the scales in local races in towns and neighborhoods across the country			2
the @entity76 and the @entity77 report that the @entity61 brothers are investing resources in local races , such as county board and small - town mayoral elections			1
they 're exerting their influence in debates over local issues such as property taxes			2
it 's a tall task to stand up to , especially when people like the @entity89 are spending with no end in sight			2
even @entity92 , whose 2012 candidacy was kept alive month after month by @entity15 , is now turning on his former patron and his ilk : " whether it 's the @entity61 brothers or ( @entity99 ) @entity98 on the left or @entity101 ( @entity15 ) , " @entity92 told the @entity96 , " if you 're going to have an election process that radically favors billionaires and is discriminating against the middle class — which we now have — then billionaires are going to get a lot of attention			1
" according to a @entity110 , about half of @entity38 know who the @entity61 brothers are			1
considering the lengths that they have gone to keep their involvement in local affairs secret , that figure is a victory for watchdogs and government sunshine groups , not to mention @entity21			2
but it 's alarming for anyone disturbed by their ability to exert disproportionate influence with millions of dollars that represent little more than pocket change to them			0
the @entity61 brothers are legally allowed to flood " dark money " into your town , influencing who represents you in @entity131 or the @entity68 , or who sits in your mayor 's office			1
they can do so anonymously , thanks to a ruling by the @entity138 in @entity139			2
and with the court 's recent ruling lifting the cap on the number of candidates @entity15 , the @entity89 and others can give money to , there seems to be little left in their way			1
even though it 's only april , the @entity61 brothers are already breaking spending records			1
@entity152 , one of the @entity89 ' front groups , has spent more than $ 30 million since last august running ads in at least eight states			0
according to the @entity77 , @entity152 has more than " 200 full - time paid staffers in field offices in at least 32 states			0
" it 's no coincidence that these targets tend to follow @entity164 ' business interests			0
in @entity166 , rep. @entity165 has called attention to the toxic mountain of petroleum coke -- a byproduct of refining oil sands -- that stands in @entity173 and is owned by @entity174			0
also called petcoke , the substance poses environmental and public health concerns when the dust blows into the air and water			0
@entity165 called out the @entity61 brothers in a news conference at the restaurant of @entity183 , who lives near one of the petcoke storage sites in southwest @entity173 and said he was fearful for the health of his then - pregnant wife and then - unborn child			1
in return for his efforts to represent the well - being and safety of his constituents , @entity165 's bid for the @entity68 has been targeted with millions of dollars in attack ads from the @entity89 and @entity152			0
and like the petcoke , the commercials play dirty			0
one such ad featured @entity198 , who has cancer , claiming that she lost her doctor under the @entity201 and that insurance became " unaffordable			0
" a fact check showed that neither claim was true and noted that she even experienced " substantial savings " under the law			0
no community is too small			0
@entity152 's @entity210 chapter flooded @entity211 , home to fewer than 5,000 voting - age residents , with a thousand brochures attacking seven county board candidates as " anti-mine radicals			0
" another full - color mailing supported the organization 's preferred pro-mine candidates			0
the dispute ? a debate over new mining regulations friendly to @entity222 and their proposal to construct a $ 1.5 billion iron ore mine in @entity211 and @entity226 counties			0
@entity227 , state director of @entity152 , recently admitted , " the mining issue has been a big one for us			0
" one candidate attacked by @entity152 told the @entity231 , " i have a hard time understanding why the @entity61 brothers think i am such a threat to their well - being — that they single me out in poor little @entity211 ? " sure enough , on @entity235 , four out of the seven @entity61 - and @entity152 - backed candidates won			1
whether billionaires are buying federal candidates who will lower their taxes or local officials favorable to their business interests , their outsized influence is a threat to our democracy , particularly when it is obscured in the form of " dark money			1
" middle - class @entity38 -- who ca n't afford to buy a school board seat , let alone a @entity68 seat -- deserve elected officials and a system that will ensure their voices are heard			0
join us on @entity255 / @entity254 .			0

@entity257 says billionaires spend money to get politicians who help them
@entity15 , @entity61 brothers want politicians who favor lower taxes , she argues
such *political* spending is legal , thanks to recent @entity138 rulings , she says
