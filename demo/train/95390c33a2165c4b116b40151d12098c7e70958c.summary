@entity0 -- hoping to quell growing concerns in @entity3 about enhanced security procedures for airline passengers , top administration officials who oversee airport security went to @entity7 on tuesday to explain the new methods and why they are needed			1
the closed , nearly two - hour briefing for congressional staff members included a detailed explanation of new advanced imaging technology that has sparked outrage from some passengers because it captures an image of their bodies through their clothing			2
also , @entity20 officials demonstrated the invasive pat downs required for passengers who either refuse a full body scan or who need a follow - up inspection after an image is taken			1
" i feel bad for the girl they put in front of 50 people when they were doing a pat down , " said one @entity28 senate staff member about the female @entity20 employee who was part of the demonstration , reflecting the concerns of many passengers about being touched in their private areas by security agents			1
however , a @entity42 staffer who was there said it was all very professional			0
" i do n't think there was an emotional reaction one way or another , " the aide said			0
" they explained -- based on what we know and what the threat is -- we think this is the best way to mitigate the risks			0
" another aide , who refused to say if he was a @entity57 or a @entity28 , said the briefing would help lawmakers " understand the difference between a standard pat down and a more rigorous one			2
" a @entity64 undersecretary and two @entity20 assistant administrators conducted the briefing , the second of two such meetings on @entity7 this week			2
the security agency set up the briefings after being " deluged " by calls for more information from congressional offices , which were themselves getting questions from angry and confused constituents , according to an administration official who asked not to be identified because he was n't authorized to speak about the closed briefing			1
" folks are getting a lot of concern from the constituents and they just want to be able to answer phone calls that they get at their offices , " said the official , who described the session as " a very grown - up exchange of questions and answers			1
" one @entity42 aide said the @entity20 's effort to boost security has become a public relations problem because images of the tough new procedures are disturbing to many people			1
" it 's always tough for the government to get their side of the story out compared to how quickly someone with @entity103 video , @entity104 , @entity105 , all those things , can			0
for all the things they are trying to do to get the word out , one single isolated incident gets a lot more press than all the efforts they 're trying to do , " the aide said			0
two @entity28 aides who spoke to @entity1 complained that despite the briefing being labeled by @entity20 as " @entity119 " -- containing " security sensitive information " -- staffers were not required to show identification when they arrived			2
they simply signed an attendance sheet that was passed around			0
" they have no clue who was in there , " one of the @entity28 aides said .			0

session provides information for members of @entity3 to tell concerned constituents
