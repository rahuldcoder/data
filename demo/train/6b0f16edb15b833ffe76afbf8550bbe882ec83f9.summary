-- it was the first house she looked at upon arriving in the small town in central @entity4 that would be her home for a semester abroad			1
but @entity6 immediately knew it was the one for her			1
the @entity9 student had been in @entity10 for just a few hours on a hot summer day in 2007 with her younger sister , @entity12 , who saw a poster that included the word " appartamento			2
" they followed the girl who had posted the ad to a charming , four - bedroom villa near the @entity20 of @entity10 overlooking a small valley where figs grew			1
the sisters chatted for hours in the kitchen with the two friendly @entity4 girls who lived there and made plans with them to tour the town the next day			1
to the wanderlust - driven young @entity30 , who had been hitting the books hard and working multiple jobs since high school so she could study abroad , it was a dream come true			1
" she did n't need to see any other place , she did n't need to see any other listings , she was set , " says her sister			2
@entity44 exchange student @entity42 moved into the house shortly after @entity46 settled in			1
the two foreigners became fast friends , @entity46 's friends and family say , as they explored @entity10 together			1
none of them had any way of knowing that just weeks later , the home would be the scene of a grisly stabbing that would leave @entity57 dead and @entity46 branded her cold - blooded killer			1
prosecutors in @entity10 said @entity46 directed then - boyfriend @entity60 and another man infatuated with her , @entity42 , to hold @entity57 down as @entity46 played with a knife before slashing @entity57 's throat			1
@entity46 and @entity60 were convicted in 2009			1
@entity46 was sentenced to 26 years in prison and @entity60 is serving a 25 - year sentence			1
@entity67 , a drifter originally from the @entity68 , was tried separately and is serving a 16 - year sentence			1
@entity46 and @entity60 are awaiting a ruling on their appeal against conviction			1
media paints two portraits of @entity46 the sordid saga has played out in worldwide media long enough to have broken into dual narratives			1
some journalists have portrayed @entity46 as an overly trusting college student who some believe was railroaded by the @entity4 justice system			1
other media paint her as a licentious , manipulative young @entity30 still trying to get away with murder , despite an alleged confession , which she quickly recanted , and a conviction			1
to @entity46 's friends and family , it 's a no - brainer			1
they grimace at the description prosecutors painted of @entity46 as a resentful @entity30 so angry with @entity57 that she exacted revenge during a twisted sexual misadventure			1
nothing in her past indicated she had the desire or capacity to kill anyone , let alone a friend , they say			1
one friend told @entity0 she was the kind of person who would pick up a spider and take it outside rather than kill it			2
more than anything , they say , her life had been all about immersing herself in new experiences and creating opportunities to travel abroad			2
easy daughter growing up in @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity46 was an easy daughter from the start , says @entity120 , @entity46 's mother			1
she was a child who never had to be told to do her homework or go to bed on time			2
she maintained a balance between a life indoors , where she studied regularly and read for pleasure , and a passion for outdoor activities and sports , in particular gymnastics and soccer			2
@entity46 's desire to study foreign languages and experience different cultures also became apparent early on , @entity120 says			1
she took @entity135 in middle school and began expressing a desire to travel abroad			2
even though her parents told her they could n't afford a private high school , she applied on her own and was accepted with a substantial scholarship			2
she learned @entity142 in high school and spent time in @entity144 as part of her studies , her mother says			2
" she loved learning languages			0
she thought about being an interpreter			0
she really wanted to be a writer and i said , ' maybe you need to get a day job while you 're trying to make money being a writer			0
' and then she thought about being an interpreter			0
languages were definitely her kind of gift			0
" in 2004 , her mother took her daughters to @entity159			0
they visited family in @entity161 and spent @entity162 in @entity163 , @entity164			2
" they just loved seeing the history and the culture and differences in people			0
and it was a great experience , " @entity120 said			0
@entity46 eventually turned her sights to studying abroad in college			1
she rejected soccer scholarships from several schools because she knew she would have to commit to the sports program			0
so again , she set her sights on a longshot : the highly competitive @entity9			0
she got in and made a positive first impression on practically everyone she met , says friend @entity179 , who testified at her trial as a character witness			0
" i think it was her just open personality to , you know , see the good things in people and have always a positive attitude about everybody and everything in the world			0
and it was really refreshing coming to school and meeting people like that , especially like her , who were , you know , so willing to see everybody 's perspectives about , you know , anything			2
" @entity179 adds she worked hard to keep up her @entity203 , making the dean 's list almost every quarter , so she could travel her junior year			1
" i think ( studying abroad ) was kind of an extension of that personality where she always wanted to meet people and -- and just get their perspectives on the world , because there 's really no better way of opening yourself up than to travel the world , " @entity179 says			2
she considered @entity164 , @entity161 and @entity216 , her mother says , before deciding on @entity4 , a place she 'd never been and where the people spoke a language she had n't studied			1
" she wanted to try something different , " @entity120 says			0
" once she decided on @entity4 , she thought about going to the really typical places : @entity222 or @entity223			1
but she really thought that to her seemed more touristy			0
and she wanted just everyday , small - town , regular @entity4 and not where there would be hundreds of @entity227 - speaking people			1
she wanted to immerse herself in a smaller town and -- she looked around and @entity10 had a program			0
" @entity230 worried about her but took comfort in the fact that she would be close to relatives in @entity159			0
" you worry if you send your kids that far away			0
but it was also a dream of hers that you know , nobody was going to squash			0
i worried that she was too trusting			0
i worried that she did n't have enough self - preservation kind of instincts			2
" @entity159 adventure @entity46 worked in two coffee shops and an art gallery , living frugally to save the $ 10,000 she would need for the trip			1
finally , the time arrived for her to begin her adventure in august 2007			0
she and her sister went to @entity159 to visit relatives before catching a train to @entity10			0
from the start , it was an adventure , her sister says			0
" we showed up in @entity10 on the train and just thought we could find our way to her hotel , and realized that we had no idea where we were going			0
so we ended up hiking with our backpacks like , five miles right off the train station to even find a bus that would take us to our hotel , " @entity260 says			0
as soon as they arrived , @entity46 made her way to the @entity267 to get the lay of the land			1
" the city was really beautiful			0
you could really tell on @entity6 's face and how she was acting that she was instantly in love			1
" after school began , @entity46 sent enthusiastic e-mails to her family nearly every day			1
she described attending a chocolate festival and a book fair with @entity57			0
a few weeks into her stay , she wrote in various e-mails that she had met a handsome computer engineering student who looked like @entity282 at a classical music concert			0
@entity46 had been a " late bloomer " in terms of dating , so news that she had met @entity60 made her sister happy			1
" she was just infatuated with the whole idea of him			0
first of all , he was a foreign guy , he was sweet , he was really kind , he was smart			0
... he was exactly my sister 's type			2
" it was pretty exciting			0
i wanted to learn more about him , and it just happened that they were only dating for two weeks before everything happened			0
i wish -- i really wish that they could 've gotten to know each other a lot better			0
" @entity0 's @entity299 and @entity300 contributed to this report .			2

friends , family : nothing about @entity6 's past suggests she 's a killer
@entity46 is serving a 26 - year @entity4 prison sentence for killing @entity42
