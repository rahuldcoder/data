nevertheless , there 's a website called @entity25 that acts as a sort of catharsis for people fed up with some of @entity3 's recent choices , such as allowing your friends to location - tag you in @entity32 by default with no confirmation from you			1
maybe you 'll want to block @entity2 after you see the fictionalization of his early years at @entity3 in the upcoming movie " @entity37 " just for the principle of the thing			2
or maybe you 'll just laugh a little at this easter egg or bug and move on with your life			0
either way , you can verify this by going to @entity2 's @entity3 profile , scrolling down near the button of the left panel and clicking " report / @entity9 this person , " then checking " @entity9 this person " and clicking " submit			0
