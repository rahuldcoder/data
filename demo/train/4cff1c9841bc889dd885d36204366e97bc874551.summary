-- four weeks after the shootings in @entity3 , @entity4 , the box office remains in a relative slump — despite performing over 20 percent better than the same weekends in 2011 and 2010			0
according to industry consulting firm @entity8 , 17 percent of moviegoers are still reluctant to head to the theater following the shooting			0
while that number has dropped from the 21 percent who claimed they were reluctant one week after the shooting , it 's still telling — and discouraging — for @entity16			0
fortunately , moviegoers have a lot of options to choose from			0
when the top seven movies at the box office all earn over $ 10 million , it 's clear that the box office is n't in totally dire straits , but it does n't seem to be firing on all cylinders			1
@entity26 and his weathered crew of grizzly action stars ( and fresh - faced @entity29 ) pushed their explosive sequel " @entity35 " to a $ 28.8 million debut , 17 percent lower than the $ 34.8 million bow of 2010 ′ s original " expendables			1
" the number one debut marks the first time pop culture icon @entity39 has ever topped the box office			0
there really is nothing he ca n't do			0
@entity43 spent $ 35 million to acquire the film , which was made by @entity45 for a reported $ 90 million			1
audiences , which were 63 percent male and 65 percent above the age of 25 ( both older and more male despite the addition of @entity29 ) , issued the film a healthy " a- " @entity53 grade			0
the explosive action entry also earned markedly better reviews than its predecessor , which could spur positive word - of - mouth , which expendables 2 will need in order to match the original 's $ 103.1 million domestic finish and for @entity26 to justify another sequel			1
" @entity65 " held second place after dropping 55 percent to $ 17 million			1
@entity67 's $ 125 million sequel , which replaced star @entity68 with " @entity69 ' " @entity70 , has now earned $ 69.6 million after ten days			1
by comparison , " the @entity72 " earned $ 69.3 million during its opening weekend in 2007			1
@entity83 ' " @entity82 " kicked off its run in third place with $ 14 million — a touch behind the $ 16.8 million that @entity77 , which was also made by @entity79 , earned in its debut			1
the @entity85 flick , about a boy who can communicate with the dead , launched very wide in 3,429 theaters , and it achieved a rather lackluster $ 4,085 venue average — the least of any of the newcomers , including " the @entity90 , " which found about $ 4,199 at each of its 2,598 theaters			0
audiences gave " @entity82 " a " b + " cinemascore grade , which , again , was the lowest of any of the new releases , despite the fact that it earned the strongest critical reviews by far			0
" @entity82 " will need some incredible holds in order to match @entity77 's $ 75.3 million finish , but that film benefited from being part of the 3 - d craze that peaked in 2009			1
" @entity82 " is entering a very different marketplace where @entity85 affection has long since passed			0
in fourth , @entity107 and @entity109 ' comedy " @entity113 " dipped 50 percent to $ 13.4 million , which lifted the r - rated hit 's total to $ 51.7 million			1
while " @entity113 " will likely miss the $ 100 million mark , it cost @entity116 only $ 30 million to make , and it should prove a profitable venture for the studio			1
the allure of @entity121 's final performance did n't drive many crowds to @entity123 , which began in fifth place with $ 12 million			1
as a point of comparison , the concert doc @entity126 : " @entity128 " -- which arrived four months after @entity126 's death — started off hotter than " @entity123 , " earning $ 23.2 million in its opening weekend in october 2009 on the way to a $ 72.1 million finish			1
@entity123 did n't have @entity85 ticket prices working on its side , but still , its less - than - stellar box office is somewhat surprising given @entity121 's status as pop royalty			1
fortunately , the @entity141 release cost only $ 14 million , and that low cost will be its saving grace			2
thanks to a narrow theater count of 2,244 , " @entity123 " notched a sturdy , if uninspiring , $ 5,348 per theater average , and if it can garner strong word - of - mouth — which seems likely given its " a " @entity53 grade — it could find legs in the weeks to come			1
" @entity123 's " leading lady @entity151 , who won season 6 of " @entity153 , " is n't the first @entity153 champ to show up at the box office , though she did garner the strongest opening weekend results			1
season 4 winner @entity157 had a supporting role in 2011 ′ s " @entity160 , " which opened to $ 10.6 million on the way to a $ 43.9 million finish			2
season 1 winner @entity162 led the famously awful musical " from @entity166 , " which earned $ 4.9 million total in 2003			2
now , if only @entity167 could match their album sales			0
as reported yesterday , sixth place finisher " @entity170 , " which grossed $ 11.1 million ( down 41 percent ) in its fifth weekend , passed the $ 400 million milestone			1
it has now earned $ 409.9 million total , and has passed " @entity177 " ( $ 407.7 million ) as the 12th highest - grossing domestic performer of all time			2
the final new release of the weekend , " the @entity90 , " started back in seventh place with $ 10.9 million			1
@entity181 's $ 25 million family drama , which stars @entity182 and @entity183 , earned $ 4.3 million on wednesday and thursday , which gives it an unremarkable five - day total of $ 15.2 million			2
" @entity191 , " which was issued an " a- " @entity53 grade , will have to rely on ( leafy ) legs to drive its business			0
@entity183 has had bad luck at the box office ever since her breakout leading role in 2004 ′ s " @entity198			0
" she has a few bright spots on her resume — namely the ensemble comedy " @entity203 , " which earned $ 110.5 million , and , to a lesser extent , the @entity206 rom - com " @entity207 , " which grossed $ 55.3 million — but she 's mostly starred in major misfires like @entity211 ( $ 24.4 million total ) , @entity213 ( $ 15.5 million ) , @entity214 ( $ 18.5 million ) , and @entity215 ( $ 33 million )			2
bubbling under the @entity220 at number 13 , the @entity219 documentary 2016 @entity217 's @entity216 expanded from 61 theaters into 169 locations , and increased its gross by 294 percent to $ 1.25 million			2
tellingly , the film 's per theater average increased from $ 5,202 to $ 7,391 this weekend , a rare feat at the box office — but especially when a film 's theater count nearly triples			2
2016 @entity217 's @entity216 has grossed $ 2.1 million in six weeks , and if it maintains this sort of momentum , it could become a major sleeper hit			2
