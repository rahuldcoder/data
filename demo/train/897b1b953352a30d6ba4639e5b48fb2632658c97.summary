@entity8 leader @entity7 said his support lies with @entity10 and those who oppose a @entity14 - backed tribunal 's investigation of the assassination of a former prime minister			1
" i 'm assuring that the party will remain persistently on the side of @entity10 and the resistance , " @entity7 said in a televised news conference friday			2
@entity6 's military wing is often referred to as a resistance movement in the @entity24 world			2
' kingmaker ' holds the key " hopefully , the democratic game will move away from the tensions and the sectarian alliances , and we should stay open for dialogue , despite the schism that has happened and will continue to happen , " said @entity7 , who heads the @entity27			2
