@entity0 -- @entity2 is an @entity4 treasure			1
he is quite simply one of the few @entity4 in recent years to have generated powerful new ideas that are creating more jobs here			1
he wrote the national bestseller , " @entity7 , " which provided the definitive blueprint for retooling @entity4 industry to create pathways out of poverty and generate a national economic recovery			0
he was a driving force behind passage of the 2007 @entity15			0
in fact , @entity2 's ideas have helped lead to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs across the industrial @entity21 and throughout the nation 's decaying urban and rural areas			1
@entity2 also may be the most misunderstood man in @entity4			1
he resigned from the @entity24 last year after some sought to discredit him for missteps , such as political statements made years ago			2
however , we can never afford to forget that a defining trait of our country is our collective capacity to practice forgiveness and celebrate redemption			0
this is a nation built on second chances			0
in @entity4 , we ultimately judge people on what they are doing today for tomorrow , not for what they did yesterday			0
when former @entity40 gov. @entity39 embraced integration , we forgave him for having championed segregation			0
when @entity44 sen. @entity43 embraced civil rights legislation , we forgave him for having defended racist organizations			0
the real @entity2 story is about how a young leader became the father of the green jobs movement			1
in response to a longstanding jobs crisis in @entity53 , @entity54 , he helped initiate the @entity55 , one of the nation 's first job training programs targeting low - income people for work in the solar and green industries			1
this program has become a renowned model for numerous initiatives that are now up and running across @entity4			2
today , @entity67 's vision for seizing the opportunity created by the global shift to solar power and other forms of renewable energy is becoming a reality			2
policies he has promoted are bringing change to downsized economies across @entity4			0
in @entity79 , @entity80 , workers have gotten new jobs from a county wind turbine plant and from other wind energy projects generated by the @entity84			2
the jobs are union jobs with health benefits and living wages			2
at a time of record unemployment , when 2.7 million @entity4 are getting ready to lose unemployment benefits , green jobs can provide a way up for some families in dire need of good options			1
long before joining the administration , @entity2 was @entity4 's champion for green jobs			1
he helped found three national organizations , including " @entity100 " in 2007 , that are pushing for green energy jobs for @entity4 who urgently need work			2
far from the divisive caricature painted by some cable news outlets , @entity2 has been one of @entity4 's most effective and inspiring bridge - builders			1
he has successfully brought together labor leaders , business executives , civil rights champions , students and environmentalists to find creative solutions to the ecological and economic crises			0
his efforts earned him designation as a @entity115 by the @entity116 in 2004			0
his ideas served as the foundation for the 2007 @entity15 , signed by president @entity119 , which paved the way for $ 500 million in retraining funds provided under the @entity84 during the @entity124 administration			1
walk through the streets of @entity126 , @entity80 , or @entity127 , @entity128 , once the steel and the rubber capitals of the world respectively , and you see the dire need for redeeming the @entity4 heartland			0
the lack of industry has devastated towns and cities and thrown families into catastrophe			0
through @entity100 , and others organizations , @entity2 continues to work for an @entity4 economy that can thrive again -- a nation whose prosperity reaches beyond @entity145 to @entity146 and back streets			1
a country where jobs in installation , manufacturing and construction flourish again -- to upgrade our homes to conserve energy , create solar panels , build electric cars , and manufacture wind turbines and smart batteries			0
furthermore , @entity2 is working to make sure that our country does not lose out to @entity161 , @entity162 or @entity163 in the green industrial race			1
his vision gives us a fighting chance to reclaim something we lost years ago , back when steel was king			0
in those days , blue - collar workers could support their families with their wages , and our nation was not the world 's leading debtor			0
@entity2 's vision , in short , is a vision for @entity4 restored to its place as the definitive world economic leader			1
it is for reasons like these that @entity182 named @entity67 one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2009 and that i am proud to give him the @entity189 president 's @entity187 at our 41st @entity190 this friday			1
