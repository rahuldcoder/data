-- @entity2 champion @entity1 fell at the first hurdle of the @entity4 tuesday as she was defeated by the unseeded @entity5 of @entity6 7 - 5 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 1			1
the world @entity8 's early exit follows that of men 's @entity2 champion @entity11 , who lost monday to @entity14 outsider @entity13			1
for @entity5 , the victory marked just the fifth match she has won this year			1
the 21 - year - old won the girls title in @entity19 in 2009 but has struggled to replicate this success in the seniors and is currently ranked 103 in the world			2
" after the draw i was n't very happy , but i made sure i prepared as well as i could and was ready to play my best tennis , " @entity5 said in her post-match interview on @entity24			1
" when i got on court , i thought , ' i 'm at home , be positive			0
' " i tried to get my forehand into play and attack her forehand whenever i could and it worked well			0
i 'm really glad i could produce such good tennis in front of all these supporters			0
" @entity1 , a @entity4 winner in 2011 , committed 37 unforced errors compared to her opponent 's 25 and surrendered meekly in the final set			1
her defeat marks the first time a ladies @entity2 winner has lost in the first round of the @entity4 since @entity45 in the year 2000			1
unsurprisingly , @entity1 cut a dejected figure in her post-match press conference , telling reporters : " nobody says if you 're number two in the world you have to win all the matches			2
i mean , this is tennis			0
" i think it does n't matter who plays today against me , i always lose because i do n't think i put pressure on her			0
i think today i gave away the match			2
i think today is not about tennis , so many things are wrong			0
" elsewhere on tuesday , @entity62 's @entity61 was eliminated 7 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 in the opening round by @entity65 's @entity64			1
the 13th seed , whose engagement to golfer @entity69 was broken off last week , has only once advanced past round three in @entity19 -- in 2010			1
fourth seed @entity71 , from @entity73 , cruised past @entity75 opponent @entity74 6 - 0 , 6 - 2 in just 55 minutes and will now face @entity77 's @entity76 who overcame @entity78 , from the @entity79			1
@entity82 no. 6 seed @entity80 and compatriot @entity83 -- the 2008 winner -- both secured second round berths , as did 21 - year - old @entity87 @entity86			1
in the men 's draw , fourth seed @entity88 , from @entity14 , made light work of his opening encounter , dispatching @entity94 @entity93 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 1			1
@entity95 , the reigning @entity96 champion , took four sets to see off the challenge of @entity99 from @entity100 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 4 , 3 - 6 , 6 - 3			1
@entity95 has been trying to rediscover his best form after back surgery last year and he told the tournament 's official website : " i 've been moving fairly well the last couple of weeks			2
" it was windy , especially at the start			0
you want to dictate as many points as you can but when it 's breezy , it 's tricky to stick to your tactics			2
i did n't go for my shots too much			0
i just tried to be patient			0
" @entity95 has been without a coach since parting with @entity114 earlier this year , but he joked that he is finding it hard to appoint a successor			2
" have i found a coach ? hopefully soon			0
i 'm trying but not many people want to work with me so it 's not that easy , " he added			0
@entity120 , the no. 11 seed from @entity122 , was dumped out by @entity124 veteran @entity123 , who won his first match at the @entity4 since 2007			2
there were also wins for @entity6 's no. 12 seed @entity127 over @entity129 , of @entity130 , and his compatriot @entity131			0
