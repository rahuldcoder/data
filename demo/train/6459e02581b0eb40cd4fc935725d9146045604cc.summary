-- the digital archivist who restored the singles catalogs of the @entity4 , @entity5 and @entity6 in a series of blog projects is being strongly discouraged from starting a similar project collecting @entity11 's earliest work			1
in a blog post on the nascent @entity16 site , the blogger known as @entity13 explained that @entity17 , the record company that owns the band 's @entity19 catalog , issued a @entity21 ( @entity21 ) takedown notice for an @entity11 post on the writer 's sister site @entity26 featuring a restored version of the band 's first cassette demo , with early renditions of " @entity31 , " " sitting still " and " @entity32			1
" " tell me , what role does the @entity34 ( of which @entity17 is obviously a member ) have to do with unreleased material recorded when the band had no record contract ? , " @entity33 writes , referring to the @entity34			2
" these were demos freely given away by the band			1
on low - fi @entity43 cassettes			1
and the @entity34 thinks it 's their business how ? " the blogger is now reconsidering the wisdom of pursuing the project			0
" so you can see why i 'm very hesitant to move forward with this blog , only because i do n't want to see my efforts as a writer / archivist / engineer wasted , " he writes			2
the site would in fact be a very labor - intensive process			2
as explained in the sidebar for the @entity11 , @entity4 and @entity5 / @entity6 sites , the tracks used are " taken from the best / earliest possible sources to avoid modern mastering techniques which crush the dynamics , " and the artwork is " scanned at the highest possible resolution and the type was reset when possible using the original fonts			0
" all works featured in these projects are from out - of - print sources , and some tracks have never been commercially released or reissued			0
