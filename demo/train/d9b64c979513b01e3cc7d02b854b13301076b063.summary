@entity1 , @entity0 -- even as the world 's military chiefs gathered in @entity0 to debate their next move on @entity7 , the host nation is keen to keep the talks under wraps			1
official statements have been scant , the precise date , time and location seem secret			0
expect no post-meeting press conference either , we are told			0
the " why " is very simple : @entity0 fears if it appears in any way to become a spring board for strikes on @entity7 , it will suffer			1
how it will suffer and why lies buried in layers of history as complex as the shifting desert sands here			0
this tiny kingdom has ducked and dived the worst of the regional roiling stirred by the 2011 @entity28			0
yet the few protests here seem to highlight dissatisfaction with a monarchy the @entity33 has come to rely on			1
a @entity35 defense official told @entity2 no agreements were signed at meetings monday as " this was not a planning meeting , where we come ready to discuss a specific way forward			1
" but he did say the meetings focused on ways the escalating conflict in @entity7 could spill over into neighboring countries and affect regional security as a whole			1
@entity48 of @entity0 rules over a population who have seen food and gas prices rise to the point of pain ; they endured the arrival of 100,000 's of refugees from both @entity58 and @entity7 , pushing up property prices			1
when they want the hurt to stop they look up to @entity48			0
to say @entity0 is not the most stable of @entity63 right now might seem to fly in the face convention			2
tourists are still safe here and although they do n't flock in the droves they used to , the country 's fabled historic sites like the @entity70 ruins in @entity71 are awash with all shades of international sightseers			2
but scratch the surface and the have - nots far outnumber the haves			2
most agree that corruption is at the root of the growing divide			1
the @entity82 , long a latent force for change here , exploits the inequalities			0
their brothers in @entity87 , now under the heel of the military , serve as both reminder and reason to wait their moment			2
and the often unspoken tension here between @entity95 and @entity0 finds greater voice today than in preceding decades			2
an @entity98 - @entity95 peace deal , once again under serious debate , could turn once loyal subjects on their leaders if it upsets the careful balance here -- @entity0 in government , @entity95 in business			1
in short it would not take much for @entity106 whose forces , an hour and a half drive to the north of @entity1 and well within missile range of the capital , to turn @entity0 into turmoil			1
so no surprise that this meeting , that was , we are told , planned weeks before the alleged chemical attack in @entity115 , has shrunk in profile to be almost invisible			0
even @entity35 officials appeared to play tag over who can say what			0
one directs us to the other for comment , and so on			0
one trusted source here told me of his surprise any details of the meeting had been leaked			0
for @entity0 to host this meeting , at the very moment @entity132 weapons inspectors in @entity115 are being shot at as they try to figure out if chemical weapons were used , invites the @entity7 regime to take the view their tiny neighbor is up to no good			1
the real fear is this			0
if military chiefs walk away from their secure chambers here leaving even the tiniest inkling that while on @entity0 soil they would precipitate a strike or intervention in @entity7 , then @entity0 could face terrorist attack or worse from @entity7			1
with chemical weapons now apparently freely in play , few would rule out the possibility those same gun barrels could be directed toward @entity48 's people			0
all this said , there is no secret here that weapons are being smuggled across @entity0 's border to @entity7 rebels			1
@entity159 is quite proud of its role in this , although @entity0 officials deny the help and say they work to block such smuggling			2
the real secrets are more intangible			0
for example , on how much of a hair trigger are the chemical weapons ? and what about the @entity35 and @entity0 special forces here , hidden away on army bases ? how quickly could they be mobilized ? it 's a worry that many @entity0 have : how quickly could their own stability crumble			1
@entity2 's @entity175 contributed to this report			0

a meeting of international military chiefs is taking place in @entity0 to discuss @entity7
@entity0 is an ally of the @entity33 but stability is being *threatened* by a growing divide between rich and poor
@entity1 , a *90* - minute drive from @entity1 , is within striking range for @entity7 weapons
@entity0 does not want to be seen to be facilitating strikes on @entity7 , says @entity1*90*
