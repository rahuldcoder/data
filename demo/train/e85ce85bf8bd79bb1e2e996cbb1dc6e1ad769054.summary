-- friday , president @entity1 walked into the @entity3 briefing room and gave the @entity5 people his thoughts on the @entity8 case			1
his comments were striking in their honesty and in their personal nature			2
he spoke about his personal experiences , and the shared experiences of so many others			1
he called for respect for the process and the verdict , but used the remarks as an opportunity to help others understand why so many people were angry			2
he said that 35 ago , " @entity8 could have been me			2
" he started a national conversation			2
and -- in the most predictable and disappointing fashion -- he became a lightning rod for criticism from his political opponents			2
within moments of his speech , cable news and @entity30 was full of comments from the right questioning the president 's motives and words			1
he was accused of fanning the flames of discontent			2
some said that by raising this issue , he was not being a president for everyone , just for @entity42			0
those criticisms could not be more sad			1
nor could they be more off base			0
because while @entity1 's comments may have been focused on some of the racial divisions we face as a nation , to me his remarks were about so much more			1
they were about all of the divisions we face			1
there are far too many stereotypes and bigotries that divide us on a daily basis			0
far too many people of different backgrounds who feel targeted , mocked , or looked down upon by others			0
@entity1 's comments do n't just speak to the young black man who worries he 's being followed , or who sees other people look at him with fear			1
he spoke to the young @entity71 - @entity5 man who is called a " terrorist " on the street or stared at with fear for wearing a turban publicly			0
he spoke to the young @entity77 - @entity5 man , born and raised in this country , who is mocked and called a racial slur and told " welcome to @entity5 " by a @entity5 senator because his skin color is a little darker			0
he spoke to the servicewoman who wears our nation 's uniform but finds that the greatest threat might come from male colleagues			1
he spoke to the young woman who walks down the street and feels the need to cover up because of all the eyes " checking out " her body			0
he spoke to the young hispanic - american who is assumed to be an illegal immigrant just because of his or her last name			0
and yes , he spoke to the white @entity42 who feel fear that of being robbed when approached by a young black man			0
the fact is we do still have divisions in this country based on racism			1
and more " isms " than any of us care to admit			0
so when the president says " @entity8 could have been me , " of course that 's somewhat about race			1
those misconceptions about him and the fear @entity8 felt that night are all too familiar to way too many @entity42			0
@entity8 could have been any of us			0
@entity1 has been the recipient of more than his fair share of attacks			1
but friday 's were -- for me -- some of the most disappointing i 've witnessed since he took office			1
not everything needs to be a fight			1
we ought to be able to have nonpoliticized conversations about issues that are this important			1
sometimes , rather than throw a punch , it might be more productive to just join the conversation			0
friday was one of those days			0
and unless we have more conversations like the one the president advocates -- and until we realize it 's a conversation that we all are a part of -- we 'll wo n't every fully get to a place where we are finally judged purely on " the content of our character			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity139 .			0

@entity141 : @entity1 offered thoughts on @entity144 case ; shared own experiences
he says he was *quickly* criticized as racially divisive ; it 's sad how far from truth this is
he says @entity1 was speaking to divisions we all face
@entity141 : not everything has to be a fight . why not talk about issues ?
