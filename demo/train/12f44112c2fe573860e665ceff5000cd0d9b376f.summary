-- @entity2 's top football clubs will resume their battles for a place in the quarterfinals of the continent 's biggest competition this month , with some still reeling after tie - changing moments of controversy			1
last month 's last - 16 opening legs provided bitter lessons for two @entity13 teams hoping to make their mark against benchmark opponents , and prompted calls for changes to the game 's rules			1
@entity21 supremacy continued , though the signs are that @entity23 will likely have at least one finalist for the third year in a row			2
@entity26 may provide an outside threat to the status quo , thanks in part to a mercurial talent who will sadly not be displaying his maverick talents at this year 's @entity34 in @entity35			2
here are the key talking points for the upcoming clashes : time for the sin - bin ? when the draw was made for the @entity41 last 16 , two ties stood out for neutrals and fans alike			1
@entity45 's imperious form was vanquishing all - comers , and the prospect of the @entity13 club being pitted against a stuttering @entity50 was electrifying			1
even the normally bullish @entity52 press were concerned			2
meanwhile , @entity54 's panache in @entity56 's @entity55 suggested questions could be posed for the reigning @entity59 champion @entity60			1
by the time the ties rolled around , @entity50 had found its feet again , while @entity54 had drifted somewhat off the boil			2
nevertheless , the early exchanges in both games promised fascinating double - headers			1
@entity50 's immense skill was gradually being tempered by @entity45 's physicality , while @entity54 hinted that it might threaten @entity60 's goal if it could just keep its composure			1
then two big moments turned the ties on their heads			2
in @entity75 , @entity45 defender @entity74 ' limitations were cruelly exposed by arguably the best player in the world , @entity76 ; in @entity79 , @entity54 goalkeeper @entity78 committed a clumsy but innocent - looking foul on @entity81			2
the incidents led to the reviled " triple punishment " of a penalty , a red card , and less crucially for the games themselves , an automatic ban for both players			2
as contests , both matches -- and very probably the ties -- were effectively ended			2
aside from the debate over whether @entity74 ' foul was committed inside the penalty area , the letter of the law was followed in both cases			2
but as many have since argued , the games were ruined as a result , and certainly in @entity54 's case the punishment brutally outweighed the crime			2
on march 1 , football 's lawmakers , the @entity106 , met to debate the idea of a " sin - bin " -- something already employed effectively in rugby and ice hockey -- and ultimately rejected it			2
but it did sanction the continued experiment of sin - bins in recreational youth football			0
while controversial , and arguably open to abuse by cynical defenders , a sin - bin would offer referees an extra layer of discretion , and paying spectators a better chance of seeing 22 players complete a game			0
in the high - stakes environment of @entity41 football it could be a welcome addition to the rule book			1
@entity56 's @entity55 fluffs its lines on the big stage with the exception of @entity133 , sent so forcefully back to the drawing board by @entity135 that embattled manager @entity137 ' head probably crashed through it , each of the @entity55 clubs could take a little solace from disappointing first - leg performances			1
@entity45 , having withstood an initial @entity50 barrage , seemed to be finding some rhythm before that red - card handicap came into play			0
@entity147 may need counseling to banish the trauma of his first - half penalty miss , but at least @entity54 had started to threaten the visiting @entity151			0
@entity152 also looked relatively comfortable before @entity154 's absent - mindedness in the six - yard box let @entity156 back into the tie			0
nevertheless , like the curate 's egg , these good - in - parts performances all left a sour tinge on the lips			0
@entity152 will rue not going for the jugular when the @entity165 home side was reeling , while @entity167 's striking options continue to -- rather publicly -- vex the @entity168			0
his team should still go through , though , but this performance did not impress			1
while refereeing decisions may have helped @entity60 and @entity50 coast to their respective 2 - 0 victories , their ability to retain the ball -- such an important skill at this level -- was at times startlingly superior			1
the idea of an unsophisticated @entity55 , lacking the tactical nous and basic skills to thrive at this level , may be less true than it once was , but @entity45 and @entity54 still have a way to go before they can match these hugely impressive opponents			0
do n't write off @entity50 and @entity185 , but @entity60 still favorite with the @entity52 giants beset by financial scandal and facing an unusually tough challenge on the home front , @entity50 's star looked to be on the wane in 2014			1
likewise , it is not often that @entity185 plays second fiddle to city rival @entity194 , but this year there is a genuine threat to its hegemony from the @entity198			0
both teams , however , look to be slipping back into their respective grooves			1
@entity50 warmed up for the first - leg clash with @entity45 by thrashing @entity202 6 - 0 , while back - to - back 3 - 0 wins over struggling @entity204 and @entity205 showed @entity185 's cool efficiency			0
against @entity45 , @entity50 reminded the world of its precocious talent			0
yes the red card ended the @entity13 side 's chances of rising to the challenge , but @entity50 's metronomic passing and accurate finishing showed just how tough an opponent this team can be			1
it will be interesting to see how @entity218 's team bounce back from saturday 's setback against @entity220			1
real , meanwhile , was irresistible in its 6 - 1 humiliation of @entity222 in @entity23 , and leads the @entity21 league after sunday 's win over @entity225			0
if @entity45 's prospects for the second leg show only the barest twitches of life , @entity222 's are not even worth a memorial service			0
but then we have @entity60			1
there is a sense that @entity234 has , after only the barest hint of teething trouble , got this team playing exactly the way he wishes			1
added to the muscular intensity of @entity60 's previous incarnation are a fluidity and impudence that characterized the best performances of @entity234 's @entity50 side			1
it is very hard to see how the @entity23 could be improved			0
embarrassingly unchallenged in the @entity248 , there is little to suggest that " @entity60 " will not be sewing yet another @entity41 star above the club badge in may			1
two - speed @entity41 makes things too predictable the @entity41 may be the pinnacle of club football , but survey the last - 16 second - leg ties and it is difficult to suppress a feeling of disappointment			1
with very few exceptions , the quarterfinals look pretty much set			1
just as the group stages generally went the way of the obvious , the tournament 's big seeds are rolling into the next round with only minor distractions en route			0
@entity2 's top club competition remains controversial for the way in which it perpetuates the status quo			0
without massive independent injections of cash from outside the game it is difficult to see this changing anytime soon			0
arguably only @entity277 has realistic hopes of breaking into the tight group of winners this year			0
it has to be a concern for @entity2 , and the tv rights holders that may struggle to entice neutrals to their screens again before the quarterfinals			1
whether anything can be done about it longer term , however , is another question			0
@entity291 is a genius in a world in which sporting stars can sometimes be anodyne and uninspiring , @entity293 striker @entity291 smashes the mold to smithereens			0
his swagger and apparent arrogance would be laughable if he did not so regularly back them up , but his continuing ability to underscore words with deeds is extraordinary			0
at @entity277 he is playing in a competition -- the @entity26 @entity304 -- that rarely stretches his talents and in a team that is built to serve him , so the best measure of his greatness is in the @entity41			1
once again , he did not disappoint			0
@entity291 's second goal against @entity311 went viral before the final whistle had even sounded , and with good reason			0
the fact that he will not be playing in the @entity315 is a huge loss to football .			0

the @entity41 resumes this week
eight teams will be hoping to reach the quarterfinals
@entity60 seeking to become the first team to defend title
three of the four @entity13 clubs involved face an early exit
