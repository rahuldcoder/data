@entity0 , @entity1 -- throughout its history , @entity1 has been conquered by the @entity4 , the @entity5 , @entity6 and , in modern times , the @entity8 and @entity9			1
but now there is a new and different battle being waged against the @entity1 , and the enemy is not wielding swords or guns but the threat of bailouts and default			2
for many , it 's a modern - day tragedy that even the @entity21 classical writer @entity19 would have a hard time envisioning			2
after reading all the bad economic news coming out of @entity1 , it 's easy to lose sight of the fact that the @entity21 people are still carrying on their daily lives			1
@entity1 may be cutting back on their vacations , but the country has seen a rise in the number of tourists			2
the @entity34 expects more than 10.5 million visitors this year , a 9.6 % increase from 2010			2
on a recent trip to my mother 's hometown of @entity0 , i was curious to see how this seaside city on the southern part of the @entity43 , best known for its luscious olives and as the birthplace of the @entity48 performer @entity47 , was faring amid the country 's economic crisis			1
as my flight descended over @entity52 , i could n't help but think that i was flying from the heels of one storm -- @entity55 had just ravaged the eastern @entity57 coastline -- into the throes of another			2
the sea of white marble buildings below offered no glint of the economic tempest that has produced fear , anxiety and scores of strikes and protests throughout the country			1
the uneventful three - and - a - half hour bus ride to @entity0 ( about $ 30 ) is expected to get shorter with a new stretch of national highway from @entity52			1
but how quickly will the work get done in the current economic climate ? only time will answer @entity1 's growing list of uncertainties			1
as in @entity52 , cigarette smoke is pervasive in @entity0 , and pedestrians yield to cars , whether you like it or not			1
but there the similarities end			2
unlike @entity52 , which is home to more than 3 million @entity1 , the images of protests and distress are nowhere to be visibly found in this sun - drenched town of just over 100,000			1
here , the city seems to embrace the energy of the sun. @entity93 people seem to outnumber the old			1
the origins of the city 's name remain murky , but according to relatives , it 's probably derived from the @entity21 words " kala ommata , " which means " beautiful eyes			1
" @entity0 is hardly a destination most tourists consider when they think of a vacation in @entity1			1
the islands of @entity106 and @entity107 are usually the headliners in that fantasy			2
@entity0 , the 10th largest city in @entity1 and the capital of @entity112 , is built on the foot of the @entity114 and near @entity115			1
it draws mostly @entity21 vacationers , as it 's a good home base close to other tourist sites in @entity112 and ferries to some nearby islands , including the @entity122 island of @entity123 and @entity124 in @entity125			2
within an hour 's car ride , you can visit the beaches navarino or the castles and historical sites of @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135			2
though @entity0 has grown dramatically since an earthquake ravaged portions of the city in 1986 , some areas have a small - town feel			1
it 's not uncommon to catch the smell of jasmine on a summer evening while walking the paths between the family - owned plots of lime , fig and orange trees			0
the pride and joy of many residents is owning some land -- even a small parcel -- where they can grow a variety of things including cucumbers , squash , tomatoes and herbs			0
@entity0 has a historical center with beautiful neoclassical houses			1
a 13th - century castle dominates the town and has an interesting archaeological museum and a folklore museum with relics of the @entity168 of 1821			2
in addition to its theaters and theatrical groups , @entity0 hosts an @entity172 during the summer in the amphitheater of the castle			1
but for most people , the lure of @entity0 is the beaches , with their blue waters and free sun beds			1
the tranquil beaches in @entity0 are more than 6 miles long , and elderly people taking a morning swim is a familiar sight			1
take a leisurely walk or bike ride along the promenade , and it 's hard not to stop into one the many tavernas for a cold @entity185 beer and a @entity186 : a selection of sardines , meatballs , calamari , tomatoes and cucumbers			0
i always have to smile when i get up from a taverna 's hard straw chairs			0
although patrons wo n't ever be rushed out by a waiter trying to turn over a table , the uncomfortable seats are more than likely to leave you with a funny walk for the first several strides			0
and while unemployment in @entity0 , which city officials put at 10 % , is far below the national average , there 's still a feeling of uncertainty in the streets			1
" the mood is gloomy			0
things are tough , very tough			0
it seems there is no hope , and there is n't a light at the end of the tunnel , " mayor @entity216 said			0
" strikes happen every day ; there is unemployment			0
but compared to @entity52 , things are better			0
not as bad as some places in @entity52 , but this does n't mean that things are easy in @entity0			1
there is no work , and they do n't give us any hope , and that is the worst , " he said			0
@entity216 says @entity0 's annual budget of about 100 million euros is very dependent on tourism to cover the gap with what comes from @entity52 , which supplies only around 65 million euros			1
although @entity0 does very well with tourism -- and the new national highway will help -- high unemployment and a small but increasing number of immigrants from @entity250 countries , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 have put strains on social services , the mayor said			1
hotel owner @entity253 , 35 , whose establishment bears the family name and is situated across the street from the beach , says business has been mixed this year			0
" this year we did not have a very good season in the beginning			0
june did not go as we preferred			0
" the hotel had a good may , july and august , but that success came with sacrifice			0
" we lowered the price in the high season to keep the hotel full , " @entity253 said			0
the rooms , which normally go for 100 euros in the high season , were lowered to 70 euros this year			0
with the economy in shambles and the government reducing benefits and cuts to pensions , that 's less money for @entity1 to spend on holidays , @entity253 said			0
so he 's planning to adapt to the circumstances and begin making arrangements with the hotel site @entity280			0
" good companies , if they manage , will survive			0
if you give good quality , with inexpensive rents , you will have tourists and still be able to pay off the expenses , and you will continue to live , " @entity253 said			0
@entity288 contributed to this report .			0

*traveler* was curious to see whether economic crisis had reached the town
protests and distress are not visible in @entity0 , he says
the city is rich with history and *culture* *alongside* its *bright* beaches and blue waters
