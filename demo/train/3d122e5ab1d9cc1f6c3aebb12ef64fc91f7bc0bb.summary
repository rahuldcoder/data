the violence has killed more than 1,000 people this year , according to the @entity15 of @entity1			1
nearly 200 people were slain in july alone			0
the rampant violence appears to have little to do with the @entity18 and other @entity20 extremist groups that are viewed by western leaders as @entity1 's most pressing security problem			2
rather , police and government officials say the violence is fueled by bitter ethnic rivalries and political parties vying for power in this mega-melting pot , home to roughly 15 million people from at least a half - a - dozen ethnic groups			1
three political parties are usually at the center of the fight for power in @entity4 : the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) , the @entity37 ( @entity37 ) , and @entity1 's @entity38 ( @entity36 )			2
the @entity36 , led by @entity1 president @entity40 , considers @entity4 its political base , but politics here is dominated by the @entity39 , which represents " muhajirs , " the descendants of immigrants from @entity47 decades ago			2
in recent years , the @entity39 's power has been challenged by the @entity37 , a secular party that represents ethnic pashtuns			0
hundreds of thousands of @entity37 supporters have migrated south to @entity4 because of the militant violence in their home region of northwest @entity1			0
analysts say a general lack of law and order has allowed supporters of these parties to adopt a gang mentality			0
like gangs , the factions often control different regions of @entity4 that are usually off - limits to rivals .			0
