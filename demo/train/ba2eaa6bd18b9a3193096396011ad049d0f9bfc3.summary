-- does our government trust us ? if our government trusts us , why does it take people like @entity5 and @entity6 to reveal the actions our government is taking in our name ? government should be able to withhold information in certain situations if disclosure truly compromises ongoing intelligence operations or clearly risks lives			1
but that exception must be narrowly construed , and the burden should rest on the government to prove that the information at issue should be kept secret from @entity19			1
recently , two seemingly unrelated events show our government 's continuing efforts to keep information from us			1
in the first instance , the government released hundreds of hours of tapes that @entity27 had secretly recorded of @entity29 conversations between april 9 , 1973 and july 2 , 1973			2
while political pundits had a field day combing through these tapes , lost in all this were two things			0
one , the content of these tapes has been kept secret from us for more than 40 years			0
two , the government still wo n't release more than 700 hours of additional tapes , citing national security and privacy concerns			2
could there really be information in these 40 - plus - year - old tapes that threatens our nation 's security or invades someone 's privacy ? and even if there is , should n't our government be called upon to provide us more reasons to justify its secrecy ? in the case of @entity6 , who was sentenced to 35 years in prison for providing @entity56 with 700,000 classified files , we became aware of a wide range of actions taken by our military , @entity61 and intelligence community			1
we learned , for example , that the @entity19 military had been keeping detailed data about the number of @entity68 civilians killed by our forces			0
before this leak , our government had denied it kept such figures			0
we learned that our government was spying on @entity73 officials in violation of international law and our @entity61 had been encouraging foreign governments to not investigate our torture of prisoners who had been subject to rendition			0
@entity6 also released the infamous video of a @entity19 @entity82 attack in @entity83 in which civilians and a reporter were killed			0
@entity86 had previously requested this exact video under the @entity88 but the government had denied access			0
not only does it appear that our government does n't trust us , but it also seems that some agencies within our government do n't even trust each other			1
a few months ago , @entity94 , the director of @entity95 , was asked by @entity96 whether the @entity97 was collecting data on @entity19			0
@entity94 answered under oath , " no. " of course , a short time later , @entity5 revealed that @entity94 was not being truthful			1
when you look at our nation 's @entity101 , one of the clauses that has always stuck with me is , " governments are instituted among men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed			0
... " but how can we consent to our government 's actions if we are not told what it 's doing ? conversely , how can we object to our government 's conduct if it is n't revealed to us ? shockingly , even some members of @entity96 seem to be in the dark about our government 's activities , even though the administration has provided information in a restricted fashion			1
on sunday 's morning tv , sen. @entity124 , the senior @entity125 on the @entity126 , commented that he and others in @entity96 are n't sure of the full extent of the @entity97 's surveillance programs that were leaked by @entity5			1
@entity124 said , " and that 's why i wrote a letter to the president this week to ask that the head of this organization ( @entity97 ) come in and brief folks from top to bottom			0
" keep in mind this is months after @entity5 's leaks			1
this begs the question : does anyone actually know the full scope of what our government is doing ? just this week , our government finally released former president @entity149 's testimony recorded more than 30 years ago during the criminal trial of @entity151 , the woman convicted of trying to assassinate @entity149			0
did the government release this information on its own ? nope , it took a federal lawsuit by the @entity156 to pry it free			2
if our government continues to hide information from us , the @entity157 and @entity158 of the world will not stay silent despite threats of imprisonment			2
more @entity19 will take matters into their own hands when they see our government engaging in policies and programs that violate our @entity168 , laws and principles			1
it is truly our government 's choice			0
trust us and be more transparent , or inspire more @entity174 and @entity175			1
i hope our government chooses to trust us			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2

@entity179 : why does it take @entity5 to reveal actions of our government ?
@entity179 : programs that violate our @entity168 , laws and principles break down *society*
he says government should be able to withhold information in certain risky situations
@entity179 : trust us and be more transparent , or inspire more @entity174 and @entity175
