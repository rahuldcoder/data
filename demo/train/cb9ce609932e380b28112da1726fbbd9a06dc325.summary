who knew bigotry could bring in big dollars ? hey @entity3 , we know you refused to rent your apartments to blacks and @entity7 , but can you spare some change to help us fight for civil rights ? that 's essentially what transpired in @entity12 between @entity13 and the local chapter of the @entity15			1
surely the organization knew @entity3 was the subject of a @entity19 investigation into discriminatory housing practices			1
and surely it knew @entity3 agreed to pay one of the biggest fines of its kind in history			1
it was n't enough for the @entity12 @entity15 to shun @entity3			1
on the contrary , the @entity15 awarded @entity13 a lifetime achievement award			1
that was in 2009 , just before the @entity3 organization gave the @entity15 $ 5,000			1
" the @entity15 airbrushed this away and simply said that @entity3 has been a gem in giving oodles of tickets away to needy inner city kids and ladling out some cash to charities and sports camps for them , " wrote @entity32 on @entity33			1
he 's a sociologist who has written nine books on @entity45 - @entity44 politics , following the 2009 award			2
but , that was then			2
the local chapter of the @entity15 was about to grant @entity13 another lifetime achievement award until that pesky racist rant became public in the past few days			1
the rant where he berates his biracial girlfriend for posting an @entity54 of herself with @entity55 , now a part owner of the @entity57			2
" in your lousy f --- - g @entity59 , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , " he says			2
now the group is returning @entity3 's money			1
he also wo n't be gracing the stage alongside another of their winners , " @entity70 , " the rev. @entity69			2
today @entity69 asked the @entity71 to meet with civil rights organizations , including the national @entity15 , about his former co-honoree			1
as for whether the @entity12 chapter will do business again with @entity3 ? president @entity76 says yes			1
" at some point when there has been proof , i think that would be a legitimate time for the @entity15 to sit down with @entity3 and try to work out how and why he did what he did and what is he going to do in the future			1
@entity85 teaches us to forgive			2
and the way i look at it , after a sustained period of just proof to the @entity45 - @entity44 community that those words do n't really reflect his heart , i think there 's room for forgiveness			0
" @entity76 ' remarks struck a nerve			0
" that dude needs to be fired			0
" @entity101 contributor and @entity103 senior writer @entity102 , a guest on my show , did not stop there			0
" he sounds like a fool			0
i 'm just going to come to you straight up			0
to even suggest that somehow a sit - down with @entity3 now , when if anyone should have known about his racist past , ( it ) should have been a local chapter of the @entity15			1
to pretend they 'll sit down with him now and see if that 's really in his heart when he 's been sued by the @entity19 , that man needs to resign or be fired			0
" before you jump on @entity102 's bandwagon , it 's worth noting that at least @entity121 returned @entity3 's donation			1
consider what 's happening with the other contributions from the @entity125 of @entity126			0
he donated $ 50,000 each to the @entity127 and the @entity128			0
@entity129 , from @entity128 , said the organization did not plan to return the money , which has already been passed along in the form of student scholarships			1
he also gave $ 30,000 to the @entity135 's @entity134 in @entity12 , which teaches about the @entity136 and seeks to enlighten visitors about all forms of discrimination			2
keep in mind that on that now infamous tape , @entity3 is also alleged to have said , " there are white @entity143 and black @entity143			1
" he then goes on to infer black @entity143 are " less than " white @entity143			0
still , the @entity135 will not be giving back that $ 30,000			0
" the funds were used to combat racism and teach tolerance			0
we are n't going to return money of his that was used to do the very opposite of what he said on that tape			1
" said rabbi @entity154 , founder and dean of the @entity156			0
he said his organization did n't know about the housing discrimination allegations when it received the money			1
he said his staff is not large enough to do that kind of research			0
( a google search would have done the trick )			0
oh , there 's more			0
it seems @entity3 was a giving machine , despite his remarks showing disdain for african - americans and black @entity143			1
in an article in the @entity173 , his foundation boasts of giving $ 5 million in grants and scholarship money at a fancy party at @entity177			2
that 's twice the fine he is to pay the @entity71			0
thirty charities and eight high schools got checks at his gala after hearing a benediction from rabbi @entity184 and songs from @entity186 , of " @entity188 " fame			0
recipients included a smorgasbord of diverse organizations like 100 black men , @entity193 , @entity194 , the @entity195 , @entity196 and @entity197			2
tuesday those organizations told @entity101 they were asking themselves what his intentions were , but none had resolved the issue of whether to return the money			1
( an organization not involved in that event , @entity204 said in a statement tuesday that it was rejecting a $ 3 million pledge from @entity13			0
) @entity209 , which works to get a better education for impoverished children , said it did n't want his money any more			2
" we have asked them to take our pictures off their full - page ad			0
we will not be accepting their money , or any more money going forward from the @entity223 , " said @entity217 , director of major gifts and communications			1
" we were among a number of organizations that got money from him and up until this moment we had not had an organizational conversation about his ethics			1
we knew there were some questions but we had every hope that he had the best of intentions			0
" perhaps @entity3 did have " the best of intentions			1
" but , " hoping " does n't cut it			0
i certainly understand how difficult it is to raise money , but is selling your soul worth it ? apparently the @entity15 thinks so			1
@entity244 , the spokesperson for the national @entity15 , notes that @entity245 , the onetime pro-segregationist senator , was a member of the @entity15			1
" i 'm sure they try to buy favor by supporting the @entity15			1
@entity245 was a member of the @entity15			2
we certainly did n't go easy on @entity245 and any of the politicians who support us			0
" but in the @entity3 case -- it did			2
@entity101 political analyst and @entity254 host @entity253 put it best : " you know what it is ? we like sexy forms of racism			0
someone is on the phone talking to their girlfriend about not letting black people at the game			0
denying black people housing is far more damaging than the phone call he made			2
" i could not agree more .			0

@entity272 : @entity3 made charitable gifts to civil rights groups
she says he had history of housing discrimination , but organizations took his money
some say they will keep the money while local @entity15 says it will return it , she says
@entity272 : is it a *betrayal* for these groups to take his money ?
