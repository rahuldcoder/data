-- surveillance footage shows other minors inside a @entity6 high school gym at about the same time authorities say @entity8 suffocated in a rolled - up mat while reaching for a sneaker , an attorney for the school told @entity0 on friday			1
the attorney 's acknowledgement came in a response to a @entity0 open records request asking whether other minors were recorded in the footage inside the @entity18 gym on january 10 between 1:09 p.m. and 1:20 p.m. , a span of about 10 minutes after @entity8 entered the gym			1
" i answer your pointed question with ' yes , ' " @entity23			0
the attorney , wrote in the letter			0
@entity0 made the request after the school declined to release certain surveillance photos or video , citing state law that exempts the release of " education records of a minor child			1
" it 's the latest revelation in a case that has seen @entity8 's parents challenge the account of authorities and demanded an inquest into the teen 's death			2
attorneys for @entity8 's family have called for the release of the surveillance video			1
@entity8 's parents want answers @entity8 , 17 , was found dead at the gym in @entity49 on january 11 , his body resting headfirst in the rolled wrestling mat , according to authorities			1
a few still pictures , taken from surveillance cameras at the gym , are perhaps the last known images of @entity8 alive			1
they show him walking across the bare floor			0
those images were released by the @entity60			0
the next pictures of the teenager are far more horrifying : his body , clad in jeans and layered orange and white t - shirts , is wedged in the wrestling mat. his face is bloated with pooled blood , some of which poured out of his body and soaked his dreadlocks and spilled onto the floor			0
a pair of orange - and - black gym shoes were found a few yards from the teen 's body			0
a @entity80 autopsy found that he died from positional asphyxia , and the sheriff 's office determined the death was accidental			0
second autopsy : @entity8 's body stuffed with newspaper the sheriff has declared the case closed , and the @entity90 said in september that it would n't open a civil rights investigation			1
but @entity92 , the @entity93 attorney for the district that includes @entity49 , is reviewing the case and weighing whether to open his own investigation			2
dr. @entity97 , the private pathologist hired by @entity8 's family to conduct a second autopsy , found that @entity8 had a blow to right side of his neck " consistent with inflicted injury			2
" a january 25 report by the @entity49 - @entity105 cited " no signs of blunt force trauma on @entity8 's face or body			2
" and the original autopsy results released by the @entity80 may 2 identified " no significant injuries			0
