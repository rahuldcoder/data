his father spoke a few phrases in @entity184 , saying that his son is having trouble speaking @entity187 after his captivity in @entity5 , according to a military press service			1
" the complicated nature of this recovery will never really be comprehended , " his father said			0
a senior defense official confirmed @entity1 is having trouble speaking @entity187 but the reasons for that were not clear , given the trauma he 's been through			1
' our only son ' the @entity60 government secured @entity1 's freedom in exchange for the release to the @entity67 of five of its members detained at @entity69			1
@entity1 's parents issued a statement thanking the emir of @entity145 , the @entity60 government and the former captive 's supporters			1
" we were so joyful and relieved when president @entity83 called us today to give us the news that @entity1 is finally coming home ! we can not wait to wrap our arms around our only son			1

the operation was so secretive that @entity5 president @entity248 was left out of the loop			2
" secretary ( of state john ) @entity250 did inform president @entity248 after the fact , " @entity76 said			0
@entity76 was asked if this prisoner exchange could lead to more breakthroughs with the @entity67			2
getting @entity1 out of captivity was the first concern , he said			2
" whether that could lead to possible new breakthroughs with the @entity67 , i do n't know			2
hopefully it might , " he said			0
" but we pursued this effort specifically to get sgt. @entity1 back			0
" held by warlord @entity1 was deployed to @entity5 in may 2009			1
he was 23 and a private at the time of his capture , which happened after he finished a guard shift at a combat outpost on june 30 , 2009 , in @entity270			0
he was believed to be held by operatives from the @entity272 , an insurgent force led by warlord @entity274 , who has a reputation for holding positions that are extreme even by @entity67 standards			0
the network is affiliated with the @entity67 and @entity279 , and it was not always clear whether @entity272 operatives would abide by any agreement among the @entity60 , @entity145 and the @entity67			1
an @entity5 @entity67 commander not authorized to speak to the media confirmed to @entity103 that @entity1 was captured by insurgents with links to the @entity272 in @entity140			1
over the years , the captive was transferred back and forth between @entity5 and @entity140			0
fast facts : @entity1 critics question the negotiations the @entity60 has long declared that it wo n't negotiate with groups linked to terrorists , but analysts have said the @entity60 has effectively maneuvered around the edges of that declaration over the years			1
" as the administration has repeatedly affirmed , we will not transfer any detainee from @entity69 unless the threat the detainee may pose to the @entity60 can be sufficiently mitigated and only when consistent with our humane treatment policy , " a senior administration official told @entity103 , adding that the detainees will be " subject to restrictions on their movement and activities			2
" many of the released @entity69 detainees held political positions in the @entity67 government that fell in @entity310 in 2001			1
but sen. @entity311 , a former pow , called the released detainees " hardened terrorists who have the blood of @entity60 and countless @entity5 on their hands			1
" he demanded to know exactly what steps are being taken to guarantee that they never fight against the @entity60 again			0
@entity98 told @entity103 the @entity145 government gave @entity320 assurance that the risk to the @entity60 would be mitigated			0
" they enabled us to have confidence that these prisoners will be carefully watched , that their ability to move will be constrained , " she said			0
other members of @entity330 have complained about being cut out of the loop			0
rep. @entity332 , chairman of the @entity333 , said he still has not been briefed by administration officials on the swap			0
the @entity337 @entity336 plans to hold hearings about the @entity1 exchange , he told @entity103 chief congressional correspondent @entity340 on sunday			0
" we 're getting our information -- other than a very brief notification -- we 're getting most of our information now from the media , " he said in an exclusive interview on " newsroom			0
" @entity332 said his staff was notified by the @entity142 saturday after the exchange took place , but he pointed to a law that requires the administration to notify @entity330 30 days before detainees are released from the facilities at @entity69			0
@entity98 said sunday that the " acute urgency " of @entity1 's declining health justified the administration 's decision to execute the swap without telling @entity330			1
" it was determined that it was necessary and appropriate not to adhere to the 30 - day notification requirement , because it would have potentially meant that the opportunity to get sgt. @entity1 would have been lost , " she said			0
@entity93 responds to political debate over negotiations			0

" you 've made it ... you are free , " @entity1 's mother tells her son
