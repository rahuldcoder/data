@entity2 officials were pleasantly surprised and encouraged by the initial declaration that @entity4 has submitted to the world 's chemical weapons watchdog outlining its inventory of the munitions , a senior administration official said saturday			1
the official said the declaration was more complete than what the officials had expected the @entity4 to put forth			1
the news came hours after the @entity12 announced that @entity4 had handed over a list of what it says is its chemical arms stockpile			2
" @entity18 is currently reviewing the information received , " the @entity12			0
the handover occurred a day before the organization is to meet at @entity22 in the @entity23 to discuss @entity4			2
the timing meets the terms set in a deal forged last week between the @entity2 and @entity27 in @entity28 to begin destroying @entity4 's chemical arsenal			1
under the fast - tracked @entity28 deal , @entity4 president @entity30 was to declare the weapons no later than saturday			1
the normal 60 - day process for declaring arms was expedited to seven days " because of the extraordinary concern about @entity4 's weapons , " said @entity37 , a spokesman for the organization			1
" until now , each country has been typical			0
the @entity2 , @entity27 , @entity40 , @entity41 , none have been in a state of war or conflict , " @entity37 said friday			2
his organization planned to begin reviewing monday , he said			0
" we have to go through it in detail and plan how to conduct the on - the - ground inspection mission , to verify the accuracy of the declaration and put seals on all the materials to make sure they are secure , " @entity37 said			0
the stakes over halting the @entity4 civil war heightened after an august 21 chemical weapons attack outside @entity58 that @entity2 officials estimate killed 1,400 people			1
the @entity2 and other @entity62 nations blame the regime for the attack			2
@entity27 and @entity4 say they think rebels used the weapons			2
citing international norms against the use of chemical weapons , @entity2 president @entity68 called for authorization from @entity73 to use military force in @entity4			1
as the @entity2 threatened force to degrade @entity30 's ability to carry out chemical weapons attacks , a diplomatic opportunity arose between @entity27 and the @entity2 to put @entity4 's stockpile under international control			1
@entity2 secretary of state @entity81 and @entity27 foreign minister @entity82 hammered out a deal in @entity28 last week compelling @entity4 to accept the agreement			2
@entity4 has agreed to it			0
speaking ahead of next week 's @entity87 meeting in @entity88 , @entity81 said thursday that while " the complete removal of @entity4 's chemical weapons is possible here , through peaceful means , " urgency is needed			1
the @entity94 must be prepared to act next week , @entity81 said , citing a @entity87 chemical weapons report about the attack			0
while the report did not assign responsibility for the attack , @entity81 said it offered " crucial details , " making the case implicating @entity30 " only ... more compelling			0
" @entity27 called the report " distorted " and said it was based on insufficient information			0
even as diplomatic efforts were continuing , @entity2 officials have not dropped their threat to use force and are wary , saying @entity4 could be using the diplomacy as a stalling tactic			1
" time is short , " @entity81 said			0
" let 's not spend time debating what we already know			0
" also on saturday , the @entity4 opposition coalition rejected an offer made by @entity117 to broker a peace deal between rebels and the government , calling it " ridiculous and desperate			1
" @entity117 president @entity121 , who is also planning to attend the @entity87 meeting , said he can help bring peace to @entity4 , a long - time @entity117 ally torn by civil war			1
in a @entity133 op - ed on thursday , the recently elected @entity117 president called for an end to " the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart			1
" and he signaled his desire for better engagement with the @entity136			0
@entity4 's opposition fired back , saying it did n't consider him an independent broker			1
" the @entity139 considers @entity117 's offer as ridiculous amid all the bloodshed that @entity117 participated with the ( @entity30 ) @entity30 regime , through political , economic support and military support during the past two and a half years			2
" @entity121 , 65 , has promised more positive engagement with the world			0
but the @entity4 opposition coalition said @entity117 is part of the problem			1
" there is no doubt that @entity121 's offer is a desperate attempt to prolong the crisis and increase the complexity , " the coalition said in a statement			2
the @entity157 estimates more than 100,000 people have died since march 2011 , a period in which harsh government crackdowns against protesters devolved into an all - out civil war			0
another 2 million people have fled their homeland , and more than 4.25 million have been displaced within @entity4 , the @entity157 says			0
more violence government forces killed at least 26 people saturday in @entity170 suburbs , according to the opposition group @entity171			0
@entity172 could not independently verify the claim .			0
