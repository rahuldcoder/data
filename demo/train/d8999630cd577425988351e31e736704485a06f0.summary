-- the @entity1 is about to hold hearings on whether the police need a warrant to attach a gps tracker to a suspect 's car and trace its movements while it is in a public space			1
( the case at hand , @entity10 , concerns a major drug dealer , and the police could not use the data collected while his car was parked in his garage			1
) the intense debate the case has already elicited among legal scholars , civil rights and libertarian activists , and those particularly concerned with public safety and national security is largely focused on the question : what would the @entity27 have said about the case ? as i see it , at least equal weight should be accorded to the question : how well are our public authorities doing in their dealings with criminals ? who needs more tools and who should be denied access to cyber-age technologies if we are to keep a balance between our profound and essential commitments to privacy as well as our security ? according to national statistics for 2010 , less than half ( 47 % ) of violent crimes committed in this country are " cleared " ( that is , suspects are arrested , charged , and turned over for prosecution ) and only one out of five ( 18 % ) criminals who commit nonviolent crimes ( such as burglary ) are caught and tried			1
for obvious reasons there are no such statistics available for terrorists , and the fact that there was no successful attack in the @entity64 over the past 10 years tends to make us complacent			2
however , if one takes into account that there are many millions of people in the world who hate us and wish us harm ( and at least a few right here in the @entity64 ) , we should maintain our vigilance			2
as one terrorist group once put it , " you have to be lucky all the time			2
we only have to be lucky once			0
" to argue that the preceding data show that the government should be given some more leeway is not a violation of the @entity80 , but directly sanctioned by it			0
unlike the @entity83 , which is worded in absolute terms -- " @entity81 shall make no law " -- the @entity85 bans only unreasonable searches			1
that is , it recognizes that there is a whole category of searches that are fully legitimate and violate no one 's rights			0
as to what is reasonable , it obviously changes with the circumstances			0
given that criminals can use freely all the new technologies -- including of course gps trackers , smartphones and spyware -- it seems eminently reasonable that the police should also be able to use some of these , especially in public spaces , in which people have no expectation of privacy ( or at least should not have one )			1
opponents argue that the @entity27 provided that before a warrant is issued , the police need to show probable cause by bringing data to a judge , who reviews the facts and determines whether a warrant is appropriate and how it should be issued			2
however , this is needed only for searching people 's private spaces -- their homes , personal effects , and personal records such as diaries -- and not for using a technology that does what cops have been doing for a century : track a suspect in public spaces , without a warrant			1
moreover , often some such surveillance is needed before a tip or lead can be developed to the point that it meets the standard of probable cause			0
the counter-argument that if the police are allowed to proceed , we shall be all tracked seven days a week , round the clock does not withstand minimal criticism			0
at most , the gps data tells us that someone drove a car to certain places			1
who lives or works there , what happened , etc. etc. , all remain to be investigated			0
if the police put gps devices in all the cars on the road , or even only in one out of every thousand , cops would be buried under an endless flood of data points -- among which suspects would be lost			1
at the same time , the police should be required to file reports after the fact about their use of @entity160 trackers			0
if it turns out that they are employed too often or to track people who are , say , political activists , the police should be reprimanded and if they persist , elected officials ( say , a city council ) should set limits on the use of this and other crime - fighting technologies and punish those who abuse them			0
if the data ran the other way -- if most criminals were neutralized and we did not have to be concerned about terrorists -- reasonable people who seek to deny the police the use of @entity98 without probable cause might have a much stronger case			2
however , even then , i have a hard time believing that the @entity27 meant for the police to be denied tools available to all others , including the bad dudes			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			1

should law *enforcement* need a warrant before planting a gps tracking device on a car ?
no , the @entity1 ought to decide that they should not , says @entity188
in this case , our need for security *outweighs* privacy concerns , he says
cops have already been tracking suspects in public places for a century , @entity188 says
