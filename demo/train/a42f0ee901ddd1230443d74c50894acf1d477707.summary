-- in 2013 , our tv options were practically endless			1
anyway you wanted it -- live , dvr 'd , online , through a streaming service -- you could probably get it			0
it was like something out of a @entity12 song			0
and so we turned to you , our @entity0 readers , for the second year in a row to find out which shows you absolutely could not do without -- the ones that you would proudly identify as one of your " favorites			1
" earlier this month , thousands of you flocked to our tv polls to tell us your top five picks in the drama , comedy and reality categories			1
interestingly enough , even with all of the new shows that arrived in 2013 , your favorite comedies are more or less the same : " @entity28 " is still no. 1 , with " @entity26 " a close second			1
the only difference , in fact , is that @entity35 's " @entity34 " fell out of the top 5 favorites altogether , replaced by the even " new " - er " @entity33			2
" in the drama category , several voters were clearly feeling nostalgic for " @entity38			2
" the @entity40 show , which ended its run this year , did n't even make the top 5 favorite dramas list in 2012			2
this year , however , the @entity43 and company were no. 1			0
" homeland " likely suffered under the weight of its own ludicrousness and dropped out of the top five this year			0
in its place is @entity52 's new drama " @entity53			0
" in the reality category , " @entity55 's " reign could n't be ignored			0
@entity0 reader votes pushed the contested @entity59 show into second place , knocking perennial favorite " @entity61 " out of the top five altogether			1
if you missed our voting period , feel free to play along in the comments			0
