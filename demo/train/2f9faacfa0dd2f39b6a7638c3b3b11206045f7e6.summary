@entity0 -- an @entity3 judge on monday said he would announce the verdict in the trial of three @entity7 journalists on june 23			1
the prosecution had argued that channels like @entity7 brought down @entity10 and were planning to do the same in @entity3			1
one of the defendants , @entity7 bureau chief @entity13 , argued that " a tv channel ca n't destroy a country			1
" he held up a copy of a book by @entity19 president @entity18 , then slammed it down on the judge 's elevated desk , telling him he had " underlined the parts in which @entity18 admits to invading @entity10 based on misinformation			0
" the prosecution told the court in final statements on june 5 that the three @entity7 journalists ' reports " included footage of clashes between police and protesters , but why ? in order to bring down the regime			1
but no , @entity3 wo n't fall			1
who added this footage ? these defendants			2
" " @entity41 with these ( defendants ) leads to drowning , the drowning of the entire society in darkness , " one prosecutor added , asking for the maximum sentence , which could go up to 25 years in prison			2
the three @entity7 journalists -- @entity13 , @entity46 and @entity47 -- face charges of spreading false news that harms @entity3 's national security and social peace and having membership in an illegal organization , the @entity53			1
seventeen others claiming no affiliation to the channel are facing similar charges			2
only nine defendants are in custody			2
since its start in february , the case has been entangled in domestic and world politics			0
in @entity13 's final statement to the judge , he said it was a political case			0
he has told journalists repeatedly that it was the result of a feud between @entity70 and @entity3			1
the @entity70 - owned channel backed the @entity53 during the rule and after the ouster of @entity3 president @entity74 last year			1
its 2011 popularity plunged as supporters of the new regime saw it as a political adversary rather than an opposing network			0
national security officer @entity81 , who did the initial investigation , told the court that the link between @entity7 and the @entity53 was enough for him to consider the defendants to be members of a terrorist organization			1
the then - interim government declared the @entity53 a terrorist organization in december 2013 , days before the arrest of the defendants			2
for five months , defense lawyers picked apart the case , stressing that the prosecution failed to provide hard evidence that the defendants altered facts or misrepresented reality , especially in a way that would endanger national security , social peace , and unity as the charges claim			1
when the prosecution first presented video footage and pictures it said were collected from defendants ' devices and cameras in march , defendant @entity46 told reporters he was angry " that we spent two months in prison for such flimsy evidence			0
" video footage and pictures , which were displayed twice again in court , included 2012 reports by @entity114 , reports from @entity117 's original base in @entity118 , and personal images and pictures of guns and ammunition , in addition to raw footage for some reports about demonstrations shot in @entity0			0
it also included photos and videos from @entity13 's work with @entity1 in 2011 and 2012			0
the requirements of a journalist 's work were often at the center of the argument			0
defense lawyers focused on questioning the procedure , starting with the initial investigation and up to viewing the evidence in court			0
they said the prosecution charges refer to a different @entity7 channel , @entity142 , which was banned by an @entity3 court			1
" once the officers made the arrest , they realized this was an @entity149 channel , rendering the investigations and everything that was built on it null and void , " lawyer @entity153 told @entity1			0
he was optimistic about the judge 's decision to announce the verdict in a week , an unusually short period for a process that traditionally could extend to weeks and months			0
" it means the judge does n't need time to write reasons for a conviction , " @entity153 said			0
an acquittal could be on the horizon , but others are holding back their excitement , fearing the politicization of the case , and public opinion that does n't view @entity7 favorably , could lead to a conviction			2
later on monday , in a separate case , @entity3 's prosecutor ordered the release of @entity7 journalist @entity177 , arrested last august and on hunger strike since january , due to his deteriorating health condition			1
@entity1 's @entity180 contributed to this report .			0

three @entity7 journalists face charges in @entity3 of spreading false news
prosecutors say the channel is trying to bring down @entity3 ; defendants *forcefully* deny it
defense attorneys say the charges were actually meant for a different @entity7 channel
