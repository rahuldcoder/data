@entity0 -- when the incoming @entity5 @entity4 freshmen of the 113th @entity6 take their class photo , the image will reflect two very different visions of the nation			1
on the @entity11 side : women and minorities -- a coalition that , along with young voters , largely helped re-elect president @entity19 -- collectively will for the first time in the nation 's history outnumber white male @entity11			1
on the @entity21 side : the majority of the @entity4 seats will be held by white men -- a group which far outnumbers the now dwindled numbers of @entity4 @entity21 women and minorities after the losses of two minority members and about a half dozen women from that caucus			1
" they say that a picture is worth a thousand words			0
well the picture that you see before you is worth millions of votes , millions of aspirations and dreams of the @entity5 people for problem - solvers to come to @entity0 to get to the job done , @entity4 minority leader @entity36 said in welcoming the incoming freshman class to the @entity47 for orientation			1
@entity36 's guessing game " today we officially welcome our @entity11 freshmen to @entity0			2
they are extraordinary leaders who will make our @entity53 the first caucus in history , in the history of civilized government , to have a majority of women and minorities in the caucus			1
" it also symbolizes something else that is more troubling politically			0
" it 's basically a sign that both parties are distilling to their core , and they are living in parallel universes , " said @entity64 , @entity4 editor for the @entity65			2
the stark demographic and ideological differences now reflected in the @entity4 will also likely lead to increased partisan showdowns over entitlement spending , education , health care and immigration reform , political and cultural experts say			1
studies and polls have shown , for example , that women tend to be more supportive of government spending than men , and those attitudes might have helped influence women 's choice for president , said @entity89 , a @entity90 @entity5 government professor			0
" you can draw a clear line between the changing demographics of the parties and the polarization ( likely to follow ) , " @entity91 said			0
the shift is the result of an increase in the @entity101 population and concerted efforts among the @entity11 leadership to recruit and support female and minority candidates coupled with the effect of redistricting , which created large majority minority districts in states such as @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112			1
2014 battle for the @entity114 starts now @entity11 picked up three seats in the election so far and lead in five others yet to be resolved			1
a sixth race will be decided in a runoff between two republicans			0
in the heavily contested race to win the newly created 9th @entity125 seat in @entity126 , tv ad dollars from a @entity11 super pac helped democrat @entity127 , a former state senator , defeat @entity21 @entity128 , the former mayor of @entity129			1
" ... we 're seeing a record number of @entity11 women elected to office , " said @entity130 , a spokeswoman with @entity131 , an organization that works to help pro-choice , @entity11 women get elected to office , on @entity134			1
" it says voters saw a clear contrast between the parties ... there was an absolute rejection of extremist @entity21 ( proposals )			2
" though there has been an increase in women elected to federal office , there is still room for progress , @entity147 , director of @entity148 at @entity149 , said			0
" obviously this is movement in the right direction , " @entity147 said , adding women are still underrepresented in federal offices			0
" women are 50 % of population , so i 'm not sure we should be breaking our arms patting ourselves on the back , " @entity147 said			0
and with those redrawn districts comes increased polarization			0
moderate @entity169 eye midterms warily " what @entity21 ( in state legislatures ) did in redistricting was purge a lot of blacks and @entity176 out of their congressional districts , " @entity91 said			2
" non-white voters are sufficient to win those seats			0
" losses among moderate , white , male " blue dog " @entity11 and @entity21 women and minorities further helped change the face of @entity6 , @entity91 said			1
@entity4 @entity21 lost one @entity186 , one @entity101 and a net of six women , he said			1
@entity4 @entity21 lost one of their few @entity186 - @entity5 members when @entity111 rep. @entity191 appeared to have been defeated by @entity11 businessman @entity192 , although @entity191 refuses to concede and demands a recount			1
blue dog democrats @entity195 of @entity196 , @entity197 of @entity198 and @entity199 of @entity200 all lost their races			0
the @entity4 's congressional makeover occurs as a battle looms over immigration reform , which could not only test the new - found political sway of minorities but also the @entity21 's ability to redirect on the issue , said @entity209 , an associate professor of political science at @entity211 in @entity212			1
" strategically , @entity19 needs to identify pro-immigration @entity21 and get them on board pretty quickly			2
he 's got to figure out which @entity21 are hip and realize the game has got to change on immigration and help protect them ( so ) they feel comfortable enough to defect , " @entity209 said			1
@entity21 leaders know that there are challenges ahead			2
many issues same since @entity19 's last news conference " it 's clear that as a political party , we 've got some work to do , " house speaker @entity222 told reporters after the election			0
" the principles of our party are sound , " but the question is , " how we talk about who we are as a party ? " but politically , republicans , who hold control of the @entity4 , have little incentive to compromise , @entity91 said			2
" a lot of people who anticipated @entity21 would lick their wounds ... there 's no incentive for @entity243 to fold , " he said			2
for now , at least			0
republicans " ca n't continue to write off demographics , " @entity147 told @entity1			0
over the next several generations , the wave of minority voters -- who , according to @entity5 @entity249 figures released earlier this year , now represent more than half of the nation 's population born in the past year -- will become more of a power base in traditional @entity21 strongholds such as @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259			2
that hold will extend across the @entity262 all the way to @entity110 , experts say			0
when that happens , @entity6 could see the type of political alliances that are now considered rare			0
" we 're a country that has always presumed male leadership , has always been most comfortable with white male leadership and we 're watching the transition of that notion , " said @entity267 , a cultural and black studies professor at @entity268			1
more on the @entity4 from @entity1 's @entity275			0

women and minorities now make up majority of @entity11 caucus in the @entity4
after election , @entity4 @entity21 caucus is more white and more male
differences could lead to showdowns and *gridlock* over immigration , health care and the debt
