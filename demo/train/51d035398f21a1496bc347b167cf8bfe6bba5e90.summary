@entity0 is only 18 , but that 's old enough to remember the good old days on @entity2			1
" i used to log in to @entity2 every day , " said @entity0 , a @entity3 , @entity4 , native and freshman at @entity7			2
" now , i go , like , once a week			0
on my news feed , i rarely see posts from my friends and i have not posted things on my wall in the past year			0
" her experience is n't unusual			0
teens are cooling on @entity2 , a trend suggested by recent research and acknowledged , this week by @entity2 itself			1
the shift was confirmed time and time again in e-mail and phone interviews with dozens of teens and their parents in @entity25 's reporting of this story			0
while the social - networking juggernaut continues to chug along among adults , boasting more than 1 billion active users , younger users are flocking to newer , and arguably hipper , networking tools			1
@entity32 of @entity33 said he 's noticed a dip in @entity2 use by both his 18 - year - old son and the younger employees at the retail store he manages			2
" i think his generation , and definitely the younger ones , view @entity2 as boorish and -- let 's face it -- something that their parents use , " @entity32 wrote in response to a @entity2 post seeking thoughts on the issue			2
" funny how history repeats itself in this regard			0
" instead , he said , mobile apps like @entity2 - owned @entity51 , and @entity52 , @entity54 's video tool , are where teens increasingly go to share			1
for the first time this week , @entity2 confirmed the trend is real			2
" we did see a decrease in ( teenage ) daily users , especially younger teens , " @entity2 chief financial officer @entity59 said wednesday during a quarterly earnings call			1
it was just months ago that @entity59 called the decline of teens using @entity2 an " urban legend , " saying they were active on more sites , but not cutting back on their @entity2 visits			1
ceo @entity71 added that it " just is n't true " that @entity2 has a teen problem			1
but even then , there were signs of a slide			0
in may , a survey by the @entity78 included focus groups with teens who said their enthusiasm for @entity2 had waned			1
they cited the increasing presence of adults on the site , as well as stressful " drama " among friends			1
the survey showed use of @entity54 among teens jumping from 11 % to 26 % between 2011 and 2012			0
teen @entity2 use , on the other hand , remained essentially flat			1
( albeit at a massive 93 - 94 % )			0
@entity51 use , which was n't measured in the 2011 survey , was at 11 % in last year 's			1
most teens in the focus groups said they kept their @entity2 pages , but had migrated to new tools and sites for most of their activity			1
that sounds about right to @entity101 , 16 , a high school junior in @entity102 , @entity103			0
he said the rise of new networks -- video - clip app @entity106 and messaging tool @entity109 are other popular choices -- has met a desire among his peers who would rather communicate directly than broadcast to hundreds of @entity2 friends			1
" everybody was @entity2 friends with everybody in my grade , regardless of how well they knew each other , " he said			2
" this meant that whenever somebody publicly interacted with somebody else in your grade , you would see it instantly			0
" now he 'll post things like the @entity129 videos he and some friends make about his school 's sports teams to the site , but said " i rarely ever use @entity2 to post statuses or photos anymore			1
" while @entity2 has downplayed the importance of the trend , the site simultaneously appears to be taking steps to address it			1
earlier this month , @entity2 changed privacy settings for teens , allowing them for the first time to make their profiles public			2
teens may now also turn on the site 's " follow " feature , which allows people to view their posts whether the teen has accepted a friend request from them or not			2
teens who join the site will still have their settings default to " friends only " and , if they switch to public , they will get pop - up warnings explaining what having a public profile means			2
the public nature of @entity54 has been appealing , teens say , because they can build bigger followings and interact with people up to and including their favorite celebrities			0
the same goes for other apps			0
" it makes you feel relevant and wanted because of the number of followers a person can have and the likes you can have on your photos , " @entity0 said , describing @entity51			0
she said she does n't think her @entity2 use will ever pick back up			2
@entity174 , meanwhile , was n't so sure			0
his thoughts might provide a ray of hope for @entity2			0
because , given enough time , the teens who are fleeing @entity2 become the adults who still flock to it			1
" i hope that my peers continue to use @entity2 in the future , " he said			0
" it will be a valuable means of staying in touch as we move on to college and careers			0

@entity2 acknowledges that teen users are becoming less active on the site
newer social tools like @entity106 , @entity51 and @entity52 are picking up steam instead
surveyed teens said " drama " and the presence of adults have cooled them to @entity2
but teens who do n't use @entity2 as much do n't close their accounts
