-- today is the 45th anniversary of the assassination of dr. @entity3 , a champion for freedom , civil rights and justice			1
i was blessed to be with him the last weekend before his death			0
i remember the trauma he felt as a result of his opposition to the war in @entity15			0
before going to @entity16 , @entity3 had the rev. @entity17 call for a staff meeting in his church study on a saturday morning			1
@entity3 complained that he had felt the pain of " a migraine headache for four days			1
" he said , " maybe i 've done as much as i could			0
we 've come from the back of the bus , gotten the @entity26 , the @entity27 ... " one of us -- @entity28 -- asked him not to talk that way			0
@entity3 responded , " do n't say peace when there is no peace			1
" many of his supporters had turned against him because of his position on the war in @entity15 , but @entity3 felt he had to do what was right			1
he contended , " there are those who want me to confine my morality to the war on poverty and overlook the war in @entity15			2
however , the bombs in @entity15 ultimately explode at home because of poverty			2
" he contemplated fasting until he was near the point of death , anticipating that " those who disagree with me would come to my bedside and we could reconcile			0
" but then he shook off his pessimism and declared , " let 's turn a minus into a plus , like we did before			2
let 's make this nation deal forthrightly with the issue of poverty			1
" it was with this insight in mind that we went on to @entity16 to work with sanitation workers			2
beyond their work and their stained uniforms , these workers wanted their children to graduate from college and to attain the @entity72 dream			1
@entity3 was invited to speak at the @entity74 church , but he still suffered from a migraine headache			1
he sent @entity17 and me in his place			0
it was a big space , and everyone applauded , assuming @entity3 was behind us			1
we went to the back of the church and called @entity3 to tell him he had to come , even if not for long			1
that night , he gave the now famous " mountaintop " speech			0
yet , @entity16 is memorable less for the accolades for @entity3 than for the condemnations of him			1
we idolize him now as a martyr ; we but rejected him as a marcher			0
dr. @entity3 was invested in the war on poverty , but the federal government and the media were invested in the war in @entity15			1
he was invested in justice , but many in the world were invested in the status quo			0
he was vilified , lied to , spied upon , jailed and threatened			0
sick and misguided people wanted to see dr. @entity3 dead , but he represented a truth that lives can not deter , that jails can not confine , and bullets can not kill			1
those who shot him meant it for evil , but instead they shot him into immortality			0
@entity3 can not be buried			1
when confronted with a dilemma , @entity3 often said that we face three questions : first , our vanity asks " is it popular ? " second , politics asks the question " can it win ? " finally , conscience asks the question , " is it right ? " it may be neither popular nor politic , @entity3 argued , but if it is right it will prevail			1
in the time since @entity3 saw his vision from the mountaintop , much has changed for the better			2
three women have been appointed to the @entity123 ; voting has become more democratic ; women sit on juries as well as men ; students vote en masse			0
we now have a black president and our state legislatures and local governments are comprised of people who are black , @entity135 , @entity136 , white , female and male			0
ultimately though , @entity3 's work was not about complexion , but direction			1
he fought for freedom , but equality was the next stage			2
@entity144 was the absence of barbarism and sickness ; the fight for equality is a move towards sharing resources			2
former allies in the freedom movement would not necessarily be our allies in the equality movement			0
we may go to sporting events together , like when the @entity157 play the @entity158 , but when the game is over we rarely vote together , do not share capital and grow together			0
we are missing an opportunity and growing apart			0
while we struggle over the battles of sequestration and fiscal cliffs , we ignore the growth of poverty			0
instead of horizontal divergence based on race , we now face vertical polarization that separates the haves from the have - nots			2
there is no apparent plan for reconstruction			0
if @entity3 were alive today , i imagine he would cry out for new priorities			1
he could not rest with the new forms of war and old forms of poverty			0
he would abhor the political polarization that is the new normal in @entity72 life			1
he would challenge the rhetoric of states rights and its attempt to undermine a more perfect union			0
@entity3 fought for democracy over @entity188 , the republic over @entity190 , a one big - tent @entity72 : everybody in and nobody out			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2

today is the 45th anniversary of the assassination of dr. @entity3
rev. @entity195 : @entity3 's work was not about complexion , but direction
he says if @entity3 were alive today , he would fight against poverty , polarization
