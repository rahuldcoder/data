what happens to it if no one shows up ? well , it might end up at the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14			1
that 's where you can visit a store that takes up an entire city block and find everything from the expected ( clothing , toiletries , books ) to , well , the unexpected			2
here are 10 of the strangest items that have gone unclaimed			2
@entity25 from " @entity25 " -- unlike other items at the @entity12 , @entity25 is not for sale			1
he is now a permanent part of the @entity29			0
if you 're not familiar , @entity25 was @entity32 's dwarf - goblin minion in the 1986 movie			0
a slew of ancient @entity36 artifacts -- from a mummified falcon to a shrunken head , a bunch of objects dating back to 1500 @entity41 were found in an old @entity43 suitcase			1

a full suit of armor -- unlike the @entity36 artifacts , this guy was merely a replica of a 19th century piece			1

@entity0 : what 10 movie props later sold for 8			0
