@entity0 -- are @entity2 and @entity3 comparable to labor unions and @entity5 ? @entity7 activists scoff at the question			1
but @entity9 , @entity2 ' ceo , says yes			2
" @entity2 was conceived as an answer to the hundreds of millions of dollars that unions and @entity5 and other groups on the left have been spending for years to support @entity7 , " @entity9 said			2
" so we started @entity2 because we thought there ought to be a way for us to try and level the playing field			2
" @entity18 , political director for @entity5 , says it 's a fundamentally different approach to political engagement			1
" their money is secret			1
it comes in seven - figure chunks			2
that gives them a fundamentally different role in our democracy , " @entity18 said , explaining that @entity5 's average donation is $ 28			2
" a group that exists for ultra-rich people to essentially buy elections is counter to the @entity35 democratic tradition			0
" the labor unions that invested the most in the 2010 elections say they collectively spent $ 177 million on political activities ( the @entity40 : $ 93 million ; the @entity41 : $ 44 million ; the @entity42 : $ 40 million )			1
in the same cycle , the top three @entity44 outside spending groups spent $ 147 million on political activities ( @entity2 and gps : $ 71 million ; the @entity48 : $ 50 million ; the @entity49 : $ 26 million )			1
in terms of dollars spent , labor unions are competitive			1
but it 's worth looking at the differences between the groups and how that affects their disclosure laws			0
@entity2 and @entity3 are divided because one is public and one is private			0
@entity2 , the super pac , can raise unlimited amounts but has to declare its donors			1
it can make hard - hitting , explicitly political ads. the private arm is @entity3 , a 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organization that does n't have to disclose its donors			1
this group has to live by different rules			0
more than half of its ads ca n't be explicitly political ; they have to promote a specific issue			1
since @entity3 is private , the @entity71 is the only government agency that monitors its activity			1
labor unions raise money for political spending through voluntary contributions from members to their pacs and use money from their general fund that comes from dues			1
they are not required to report all their political spending to the @entity85			1
but the @entity88 administration 's @entity86 passed far - reaching rules requiring that they disclose all their political giving , so their election - related activities are public			1
but those are n't the only differences			0
labor union representatives argue that the two crossroads groups spend their money overwhelmingly on ads , not on get - out - the - vote efforts and advocating for safer work environments , which , union representatives argue , enhance democracy			1
representatives from @entity2 say they are experimenting with new ways to get out the vote online and through technology but acknowledge that it does n't approach the boots - on - the - ground power the unions have			1
@entity3 also spends money supporting other groups that share its less - regulation / lower - tax agenda , which they believe also contributes to society but from a different political perspective			1
still , union representatives scoff at any comparison on principle			1
@entity40 political director @entity117 said , " @entity118 has taken advantage of campaign finance loopholes to create a shadowy network of front groups that can raise and spend unlimited , undisclosed funds to promote anti-worker candidates and an issue agenda that attempts to silence the political voice of working people			2
" conservative groups like @entity2 outspent liberal ones by a 2 - 1 margin in the 2010 cycle and are poised to spend even more in 2012			0
in contrast , everything @entity40 spends on behalf of its 1.6 million members is above board and disclosed			0
we will never match what the corporate interests and wealthy individuals spend , but we have the facts on our side , and we have real live people , not @entity144 's ' corporate people , ' on our side			0
" but @entity9 maintains that @entity2 is " very open " about its activities			0
" we 're very proud about what we do			0
we pursue what we 're doing ethically ; we have a strong agenda of good policies we think are good for the country , and we want to be very open about how we 're doing it and what we 're doing and where we 're doing it , " @entity9 said			0
that 2 - 1 spending figure is based on a study by @entity158 at the @entity159			0
@entity160 gathers its numbers only from reports to the @entity85 , which does not capture all election spending			2
" @entity166 unions are allowed to engage in a variety of politics - related activities that do n't meet the definitions of what gets reported to the @entity85 , " @entity164 said			2
" the numbers on @entity159 could be more conservative than what the unions themselves say they spent			0
" @entity175 , spokesman for @entity176 , a coalition of labor unions , disagrees			2
" the comparison is laughable			2
you have , on the one hand , a handful of billionaires and corporations fund crossroads and @entity3			0
they are the voice of the 1 percent			0
on the other hand , you have millions of workers coming together and supporting a handful of unions , the voice of the 99 percent			0
@entity41 members have ensured that all @entity35 workers labor under safe conditions , with fair pay and benefits for a hard day 's work			1
that 's why we have weekends			0
" @entity203 and 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) s are not limited to the right			0
@entity7 have them , too			0
there 's a crop of new @entity7 super pacs : @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 , which as of last filing had not been able to raise nearly the money the @entity44 pacs have			1
law is unfazed by the criticism , saying , " nobody thought that was controversial when they 're helping @entity7			0
you know , now we 're leveling the playing field somewhat , and obviously @entity7 are upset about that			0
" this is the first presidential election since the @entity225 ruled in @entity226 that corporations can make unlimited gifts to all of these groups , making it a test run for a potentially new era of big money in politics			1
the next filing deadline for the @entity85 is january 31 , so we 'll learn more about how much money has been raised then -- at least for those groups that have to report .			2

how does labor union political activity *square* up with super pac ?
@entity41 representatives oppose comparison on principle
election could be a test run for new era of big money in politics
