@entity0 when @entity2 graduated from @entity3 in 1969 -- she says she did not try marijuana there -- only 12 % of @entity6 wanted to legalize the drug			1
in 45 years , however , the tide has changed for legalization : 58 % of @entity6 now want to make consumption legal , two states ( @entity9 and @entity0 ) already have and two more states ( @entity14 and @entity15 ) could join them by the end of the year			2
despite their growth in approval , many activists see 2014 as a smaller , but important , step to their end goal			0
it is 2016 , when voters will also decide who they want in the @entity25 , that marijuana activists feel could be the real tipping point for their movement			1
" there will certainly be even more on the ballot in 2016 , " said @entity29 , director of marijuana law and policy and the @entity32			1
" more voters coming to the polls means more support for marijuana reform and in presidential election years , more voters turn out			0
" demographics and money are also an important consideration			0
big donors who are ready to fund pro-legalization efforts are more loose with their money in presidential years , according to activists , while @entity49 and young people are more likely to turn out			1
this means legalization activists will be better funded to reach the nearly 70 % of 18 - to 29 - year - old @entity6 who support legalization			1
on paper , activists feel their plan will work			2
but it is one yet to be decided factor -- who will be the @entity49 ' nominee for president in 2016 -- that could throw a wrench into their push			1
@entity2 is the overwhelming favorite for the @entity49 nomination , but to many in the marijuana legalization community , she is not the best messenger for their cause			1
" she is so politically pragmatic , " said @entity69 , the director of the @entity70			0
" if she has to find herself running against a conservative @entity72 in 2016 , i am fearful , from my own view here , that she is going to tack more to the middle			1
and the middle in this issue tends to tack more to the conservative side			1
" making a concerted push during a presidential election year means activists ' goals will be directly contrasted with the @entity49 ' presidential standard bearer			1
this happened in 2004 , when more conservative voters helped tip the presidential election for president @entity87 ; at the same time , 11 states had anti-gay marriage questions on the ballot			0
@entity91 has moved toward pro-legalization , though			2
earlier this year , during a town hall with @entity1 , she told @entity95 that she wants to " wait and see " how legalization goes in the states before making it a national decision			0
at the same event , she cast some doubt on medical marijuana by questioning the amount of research done into the issue			2
later in the year , @entity91 labeled marijuana a " gateway drug " where there " ca n't be a total absence of law enforcement			1
" " i 'm a big believer in acquiring evidence , and i think we should see what kind of results we get , both from medical marijuana and from recreational marijuana , before we make any far - reaching conclusions , " @entity91 told @entity111 in july			1
" we need more studies			0
and then we can proceed			0
" this is more open , however , than in 2008 when @entity91 was outright against decriminalization , a step that is less aggressive than legalization			1
despite warming on the issue , @entity91 's position causes concern among activists like @entity130 because he feels they are far from solid			1
" if reforms keep picking up ... the winds in our sails are clear , " he said			0
" but if we lose one of more or all of those elections this year , [ cautious ] people around her could make the argument that this thing has peaked and you now have to get on the other side of it			0
" @entity130 said he also watched -- laughing -- as @entity91 tried to personally distance herself from marijuana at the @entity1 town hall			1
" absolutely not , " @entity91 said when asked if she would try the drug			2
" i did n't do it when i was young , i 'm not going to start now			0
" " i will eat both of my shoes , " he said , ' if she and @entity153 did n't trip their nuts off at @entity156 and @entity157			0
" what 's more , some activists spoke highly of @entity49 with executive experience , such as @entity162 gov. @entity161 , who spent eight years as mayor of @entity164			2
@entity161 , who is also entertaining thoughts of running for president in 2016 , supports medical marijuana ; he approved a @entity162 law that decriminalized possession of small amounts of the drug in 2014			2
" as a young prosecutor , i once thought that decriminalizing the possession of marijuana might undermine the @entity176 necessary to combat drug violence and improve public safety , " @entity161 said in a statement at the time			0
" i now think that decriminalizing possession of marijuana is an acknowledgement of the low priority that our courts , our prosecutors , our police , and the vast majority of citizens already attach to this transgression of public order and public health			0
" as for where the governor is on legalization , @entity192 , his top political adviser , said as long " as long as it is consistent with the goal of driving down crime , " @entity161 is " open to sensible drug policy			2
" with an eye on 2016 , some activists are starting to contrast that view with @entity91 's			1
" i think in 2016 there is going to be a number of states with legalization initiatives on the ballot and there will be broad support , " said the @entity32 's @entity29			0
" i do n't see standing behind and defending the status quo of this destructive policy as helping a candidate in the 2016 election			0
" @entity91 has come face to face with some aspects of marijuana policy on her trips to stump for @entity49 across the country			1
while raising money in @entity9 for sen. @entity222 earlier this week , @entity2 saw marijuana in her coffee			2
pointing to the foam design atop @entity222 's latte , @entity91 said , " look at you , you got like a plant			0
is that a marijuana plant ? " to laughs from the baristas at @entity238 , some who may have seen that the design looked more like a rose than marijuana , one answered jokingly , " that 's exactly what it is			0

marijuana legalization activists plan to make a big push in 2016 .
that push will force candidates , *including* @entity2 if she runs , to take a stand on the issue .
@entity91 says she has never tried marijuana and has not been as supportive of marijuana policy as other @entity49 .
" i am fearful ... that she is going to tack more to the middle , " said one activist .
