@entity0 , @entity1 -- " ever since i was a kid , i had a dream where -- if i ran fast enough on the ground -- i could lift off and start flying			1
" @entity6 , 26 years old , wakes up			1
she opens her window to look out across the bustling pines of the @entity9 , to the clustered snow - capped peaks of @entity11			1
for six years , @entity6 has been throwing herself from mountaintops , with only a baggy synthetic suit to stop her from falling like a stone to a certain death			1
soon she 'll set off for the " @entity17 " -- a jagged , vertical needle of granite , where she will face her hardest jump yet			1
there , she will have just three seconds to speed to 100mph , twist right away from rocks and begin racing over the fearsome @entity24 below			2
or ... " there is no option -- you have to start flying			2
" @entity28 in 2006 , a video surfaced on @entity30 that gave the unsuspecting world its first glimpse of modern " wingsuit " fliers			1
they called him " the @entity41 , " and the clip showed him leaping from a helicopter 1000ft above the @entity39 skiing resort of @entity40			2
while many before him had attempted to leap from airplanes and buildings with improvised wings , @entity43 's suit was different			2
. originally developed by @entity1 skydiver @entity50 , it worked like a body - size paraglider : creating lift thanks to airfoil - shaped arm flaps			1
first used to jump from airplanes , thrill - seeking wingsuit fliers had soon relocated to low - flying helicopters , sheer cliffs and mountaintops			1
in the famed @entity30 video , the dude -- real name @entity41 -- tumbles toward the jagged crest of the mountain , then begins to glide , and skirts along the snowy piste , just feet above startled skiiers ' heads			2
the aim of the game had become " proximity flying " -- dipping down to within just two or three meters off the ground , to feel a bird - like sensation of clipping tree tops and swooping through gorges			1
in flight , average speeds top 160kph ( 100mph )			2
@entity76 ( 124mph ) is possible			2
at flying pace , the tiniest mistake or a gust of valley breeze can destabilize a wingsuit pilot			1
landing requires fliers to gain extra distance from the terrain below , before pulling a parachute to slow			2
it can be just as perilous as scorching feet from the rock face			2
the sport can count only a small group of skilled skydivers and base jumpers among its participants , but almost all can list friends who have died			1
around one in ten of them will lose their lives wingsuiting , they say			0
one in twenty , conservatively			0
@entity6 's story @entity6 arrived in @entity1 in 2009 , hoping to learn the language and , eventually , become a nurse in western @entity102			1
when she found @entity0 , she gave it all up			0
for @entity105 , the fledgling sport offers an experience like no other : to glide across historic terrain , more like a bird than a human : " it is unique			1
you know you are seeing that part of the world in a way that no one else has ever seen it before , " says the 5 - ft - 1 - inch @entity112			1
" when you land you have this feeling of relief and achievement and satisfaction ... you have achieved something that no one else has done yet			0
" @entity105 is one of the sport 's top competitors			1
she was the only female flier to be invited to compete in the inaugural @entity129			1
in timed races , she shot into the competition 's top 8 -- earning herself the title of " fastest flying woman on earth			0
" in a sport still in its adolescence , @entity105 has become an unlikely pioneer			1
having mastered skydiving and @entity140 jumping soon after her 18th birthday , she turned to wingsuits and has quickly racked up between 500 and 600 suited jumps -- being the first to take off from many of @entity0 's treacherous peaks			0
but @entity105 is far from the stereotypical immune - to - fear adrenaline junkie			1
she 's a realist who admits to often being scared , and will never be too stubborn to make the lonely hike back down the mountain if conditions change for the worse			0
in the early days , @entity105 explains , the number one danger was equipment failure			0
now it 's not knowing when to say no. the jump after an exhausting hike to the top of the @entity17 , getting to the jump point means abseiling down to a narrow rock with barely enough room for a person to stand			0
as @entity105 looks to her left , there is a 120m vertical drop			0
to her right , the same			0
" you have to learn to focus on just your body -- to see only the things you need to see -- otherwise it is too much , " she says			0
wrapped in her pink squirrel suit , @entity173 holds her breath and checks the wind and the position of the sun. " ideally you see some birds flying and that gives you a good idea of what is going on in the air			0
" " and then you go : ' ok , this is good			0
for two - and - a - half seconds , the earth rushes straight toward her , faster and faster , on all sides			1
a feeling of blissful acceptance overtakes her			0
her wings inflate and she begins to glide			0
it is three kilometers to the landing area and for the next two and a half minutes she 'll be flying			0
" i think everyone dreams about it			0
" " and i still have those dreams			0
but now they involve wingsuits ... with things i can do and things that actually happen			0

@entity6 is a 26 - year - old " wingsuit flier "
she is the only female competitor in the @entity129
she flies at up to 200kph , wearing just a synthetic " wingsuit "
the sport is one of the most dangerous in the world
