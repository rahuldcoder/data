it also stated that the company had an " obligation to protect the ' rights ' of all competitors and the competition itself			0
" " the fundamental , ineluctable fact is that a male competitor who has a sex reassignment procedure still has a genetic makeup that confers a physical and physiological advantage over women , " according to the letter from @entity8 's lawyer sent in october			1
@entity65 reached out to @entity8 but did not get a response on thursday			0

a corporation like @entity8 , they 're doing business in @entity15			0
the law precludes from discrimination on gender identity			0
" he said @entity6 seeks a reversal in the competition 's policy			1
the lawsuit also alleges that @entity8 's policy of having to compete in a person 's original birth gender , would require that transgender athletes would have to reveal their personal histories			1
