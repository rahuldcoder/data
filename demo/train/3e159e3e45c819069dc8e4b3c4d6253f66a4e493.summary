-- the so - called richest game in football hinged on a late defensive error by @entity5 captain @entity4 as @entity6 scored a dramatic injury - time winner for 10 - man @entity8 in the @entity11 playoff at @entity12 saturday			1
promotion to the @entity14 is estimated to be worth $ 200m and it was @entity8 celebrating an unlikely win at the final whistle			1
former @entity18 international @entity6 scored with a first - time volleyed shot after @entity4 's intended clearance fell straight to his feet			1
it was @entity8 's first shot on target after a match largely dominated by @entity5 -- particularly after @entity26 's red card on the hour mark			1
@entity26 went for hacking down @entity28 as he raced towards goal and it looked only a matter of time before @entity5 , managed by former @entity18 boss @entity32 , grabbed a winner			2
his @entity8 counterpart @entity34 admitted as much as he reflected on his side 's triumph			0
" we were hanging on with 10 men until a fantastic finish , " he told @entity37			0
" we were hanging on for our lives , " he admitted			0
@entity8 , relegated from the @entity14 last season , has spent heavily , backed by owner @entity43 , with a massive wage bill in comparison to other rivals in the second flight of @entity49 football			2
@entity50 and @entity51 gained the two automatic promotion spots , leaving @entity8 to negotiate its passage through the playoffs involving the next four best - placed teams in the league			2
victory over @entity58 saw @entity8 into the final , while @entity5 thrashed @entity60 to reach the @entity12 showdown			1
a cagey and tactical match produced few chances , the best coming after @entity26 was dismissed but @entity8 's man - of - the - match defender @entity64 and goalkeeper @entity65 were outstanding in repulsing @entity5			1
then came the late drama -- with @entity6 repeating a feat he achieved in helping @entity68 win the playoffs in 2005			0
it left a distraught @entity4 to be consoled by his teammates while @entity8 lifted the playoff trophy			2
for @entity32 it was a bitter disappointment after guiding his young team to third place in the regular season standings and a deserved place in the final			0
" i 've lost some games in my career but that is the cruelest , " he told @entity79			0
" for somebody to make mistakes -- we do n't blame anybody , " he added .			0
