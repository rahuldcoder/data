-- president @entity1 recently encouraged @entity2 to " take about 10 minutes to answer 10 questions " and fill out their 2010 census form			1
this year 's questionnaire is one of the shortest in history , but the results of the survey have long - term effects			0
the census , taken every 10 years , is used to determine how to allocate more than $ 400 billion in federal funds and seats @entity14 and determine the boundaries of representatives ' districts			1
" there is no representative democracy without it			0
it 's the scientific , nonpartisan , apolitical starting point of what eventually becomes a quite partisan , political process , " said @entity21 , a professor at @entity23 's @entity22 and the former director of the @entity25			1
the @entity14 is made up of 435 congressional seats that represent relatively equal slices of the population			1
when data from the census show a shift in population , seats in the @entity14 get reassigned			2
some states might pick up a seat or two , while others are forced to combine two districts into one			2
the process of apportioning seats is straightforward , but redistricting is much more complicated			0
districts are supposed to be redrawn to reflect population changes and to make sure there is equal representation in the @entity14			1
state legislators and governors typically draw the districts , but some states rely on restricting committees			1
districts can affect the balance of power in the @entity14 and representation in the state legislature			1
" people try to do things that are to their political advantage if they happen to be in power because maybe the next time the census comes out , the other party will be in power , " said @entity57 , a demographer and senior fellow with the @entity59			1
lawmakers have been accused of carving district lines around the constituents that will give their party an advantage and secure political gains			1
the process is known as gerrymandering , a term coined after @entity77 gov. @entity76			0
elected in 1810 , he signed an obscure redistricting bill that enabled greater and perhaps disproportionate @entity81 representation in the @entity77 legislature			0
related : who was @entity76 ? critics say gerrymandering gives those in power an unfair advantage and can dilute the power of minority groups			0
the @entity91 in 2006 took up a case looking at a redistricting plan promoted by then - @entity2 house majority leader @entity94 , @entity95			0
after the 2000 census , a state court redrew the @entity99 map with input from state lawmakers			1
but after @entity81 gained control of the legislature in 2002 , @entity94 promoted a second redistricting proposal for congressional boundaries			2
the @entity99 legislature adopted the plan in 2003 after three contentious special sessions called by @entity109 gov. @entity109			0
the legislative plan led to the 2004 ouster of four @entity113 incumbents from @entity114 and sparked a bitter partisan battle			0
the court ruled that the redistricting plan unfairly weakened the voting strength of @entity119 in two congressional districts and tossed out a portion of the congressional map , but found the overall redistricting plan engineered by state republicans acceptable			1
@entity21 said the redrawing of lines to the benefit of one party or the neglect of other is just a part of the political process			1
" the production of the statistics has got to be nonpolitical ... but the use of the statistics can be as political as the country wants it to be , " he said			2
" i expect people to try to take advantage of situations to advance their political goals , interests , values -- so it 's healthy			2
now , do i think overtime creating districts so incumbents are always re-elected is the healthiest way to have a democracy ? no , " @entity21 said , adding that it 's up to the voters to decide whether they want to throw someone out of office			2
the more pressing issue for @entity21 is making sure everyone is counted because he said those who are n't counted will be treated unfairly in the political process and in the allocation of economic benefits			2
with more than 300 million people in the @entity2 , it can be difficult to make sure than everyone is counted			0
@entity57 said calculating the homeless population and the population of those who do not speak @entity163 can be particularly challenging			0
illegal immigrants , for example , sometimes opt not to turn in census forms for fear of legal ramifications			2
those fears , however , are unwarranted because the information is confidential			0
" the challenge that they have is a cost challenge , " said @entity57			0
the @entity25 has to follow up with those who do n't send in their forms with additional forms , telephone calls and even in - person visits -- and that adds up , he said			1
this year 's census is projected to cost more than $ 14 billion			0
@entity21 said it 's comparatively easy to count the first 75 to 85 percent , but the last 2 to 3 percent is " really , really tough going			0
" as the census gets underway , @entity21 said trying to count everyone , as mandated by the @entity184 , should be the top concern			1
" i 'm much more concerned about trying to have a fair census than i am about some drawing of odd lines after the census is over , " he said			1
@entity0 's @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .			0

2010 census determines number of congressional districts per state
if the number of districts a state has changes , lines must be redrawn
lawmakers have been accused of drawing districts in order to create political gains
top concern should be counting everyone , former @entity25 director says
