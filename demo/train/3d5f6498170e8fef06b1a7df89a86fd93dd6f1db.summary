@entity0 -- four months ago , @entity2 threatened to scrap the 1953 armistice agreement that ended the @entity4 and resume hostilities against the @entity6 and @entity7 in response to tougher @entity10 sanctions against @entity11 after its latest nuclear test			1
this week , the famously reclusive dictatorship welcomed a large @entity15 media contingent , including @entity1 journalists , to cover the 60th anniversary of the armistice			1
on saturday , young leader @entity19 made an unprecedented move when he deliberately walked through the throng of foreign media as he toured a new museum commemorating what @entity2 calls its victory in the @entity2 civil war			1
such a shift in public posturing is common for @entity2 , which is known for bellicose threats followed by diplomatic overtures intended to wring desperately needed aid and concessions from the outside world			0
fast facts : @entity4 " this is just a recurring pattern			0
nothing special , " said @entity37 " oh , a @entity39 senior fellow who specializes in @entity40			0
the outward appearance of possible change in @entity2 under @entity19 after decades of secretive dictatorship comes amid strained relations with its powerful neighbor and benefactor , @entity47			1
it followed followed @entity50 's ascendancy to power in @entity47 , which essentially props up @entity2 through its economic ties and aid			1
since @entity50 became head of the ruling @entity56 last november , @entity54 has signaled growing impatience with @entity11 's tactics			0
in march , less than a week before @entity50 also became president , @entity47 joined the rest of the @entity61 in backing tougher sanctions against @entity2 in response to @entity11 's nuclear test in february			1
pondering @entity11 : @entity54 's problem child the sanctions prompted the war threats by @entity2 and test - firing of missiles , raising tension on the @entity71			2
@entity72 explained that @entity47 was angry with @entity19 for a december satellite launch in violation of @entity10 resolutions that raised regional tensions during @entity50 's transition to power			2
the february nuclear test further exacerbated @entity47 's anger , she said			0
before @entity50 headed to the @entity6 for a trip that included a june meeting with president @entity83 , @entity2 sent an envoy to @entity47 who got treated " like cold rice , " according to @entity72			2
@entity87 , who recently served as @entity6 assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs , told @entity1 before the @entity50 - @entity83 meeting that the @entity47 " have just about had it with @entity2			2
" they recognize that the steps that they have taken -- nuclear provocations -- are creating the context for more military activities on the part of the @entity6 and other countries that ultimately are not in @entity47 's best strategic interests , " @entity87 said then			0
however , @entity72 dismissed any chance that @entity47 would use its leverage to try to force reforms in @entity2 , saying the history and structure of the military backed dictatorship made it impossible for @entity19 to undo the legacy of this father and grandfather			0
opinion : what @entity83 should tell @entity47 's @entity50 about @entity2 the satellite launch in december and nuclear test in february were @entity19 's way of establishing his leadership with the military , on which his power depends , @entity72 explained			1
she likened @entity2 to an impoverished @entity120 dictatorship that happened to have nuclear weapons			0
now , with chronic food shortages exacerbated in the months before the harvest , @entity19 is putting on what oh called " an early summer charm offensive " to ensure his regime gets all the aid and economic benefit available from @entity47 and others			1
that means allowing in the @entity15 media for the armistice commemoration events and reportedly signaling support for resuming long - suspended six - party talks on curtailing @entity2 's nuclear program			1
in addition , recent visits from @entity138 executive chairman @entity137 and former @entity6 basketball star @entity139 have boosted @entity2 's popularity as a travel destination			1
tour operators say a record number of foreigners were coming to this year 's @entity146 , a seven - week celebration of gymnastics and music that began monday at @entity11 's @entity150			0
to @entity72 , it amounts to cosmetic changes rather than anything close to real reform			0
on friday , @entity47 's state - run @entity156 news agency reported that @entity19 supported @entity47 's call for resuming the six - party talks with the @entity6 , @entity7 and others			0
according to @entity156 , @entity19 's backing for more six - party talks came after he met with @entity47 vice president @entity162 , the highest - level @entity47 official to visit @entity2 since @entity19 took power in 2011 after the death of his father , longtime dictator @entity165			1
however , a report on @entity162 's visit by the @entity2 's state - run @entity168 made no mention of his call for resuming the nuclear talks or @entity19 's supporting it			2
behind the veil : a rare look at life in @entity2 @entity1 's @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
