-- as the @entity2 drew to a close , at the far end of the chic promenade running through @entity6 and well away from the conference center , police had closed off a small section of the road			1
gathered within the cordon was a group of around 20 protesters , some in costumes and face paint , waving flags and dancing			0
a 20 - something in a long coat attempted to whip up some enthusiasm with a megaphone shouting " we are the 99 % , " and " occupy ! " while a middle aged man strummed a guitar			2
@entity26 rock music played through an amplifier that another protestor had wheeled into the road			0
on the periphery of the group stood a wiry man in a woolly hat , with the rainbow flag of peace wrapped around his waist			0
@entity37 was handing out flyers and speaking softly to interested passers - by			0
of all the criticisms leveled at @entity6 , its elite nature is the biggest gripe			1
like other such pow - wows of the powerful , the lack of access to this minute sphere of massive influence has in past years stirred up visible dissent around the venue itself			2
at the height of the @entity54 in 2012 , protesters even camped in igloos near the heavily fortified conference center			0
@entity6 this year was oddly quiet though			1
like the bitter cold that can often grip this mountain resort in january , protests were noticeable by their relative absence			0
there was a small group from @entity63 attempting to draw attention to their predicament on friday , but little to really catch the eyes of the delegates safely cocooned behind the venue 's ring of security			1
@entity37 's disparate group had been gathered via the internet , but while they had made it to @entity6 they were still a long way from the action			1
" this is the only thing that was possible , " @entity37 said			0
" it is absolutely taboo to go further towards the center where the people ... are meeting from the @entity2			1
" i asked him why he and his fellow protestors were here			2
just like the delegates at the other end of the street , growth and inequality were on his mind too			0
" the 2015 goal is to halve extreme poverty , " he told me , " but we do n't talk about ( the fact ) that we have to halve extreme riches as well			2
" @entity37 's primary concern was for the long term impact of growth			2
the flyers he handed out quoted the economist @entity100 : " anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist			2
" " the planet is limited , " @entity37 told me			0
" in 30 years or in 70 years we have four times more cars , pollution , resources that are exploited , and future generations ' family will have nothing			0
" he had been at @entity6 the entire week , and had been coming to the town for the past 12 years			1
" this evening i will make another gathering , " he told me			0
he planned to make what he called a " thought stone " representing @entity2 organizer @entity118			1
" mr @entity118 ( is ) a very important person in @entity6 , but actually we are all the same , including the animals and the plants , " he said			1
why had @entity37 left his protest until the end of the week , and not staged it while the @entity2 was in full swing , i asked			1
" most of the people still have to work during the weekdays , so saturday is the easiest way for people ( who are not from ) @entity6 to come here			1
" the global economy may be getting back on track , but even protesters need to pay the bills			0

the @entity2 in @entity6 attracted only quiet protestors beyond its security
this year 's dissenters , *unlike* the occupy *movement* of previous years , did n't attract much attention
they *appeared* as the world 's business and *political* *leaders* were leaving town
