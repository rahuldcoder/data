@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 stops in front of the wreckage of the @entity7 temple , brings his hands together and prays			1
the monk bursts into tears , an involuntary act , as he asks heaven what he can do to comfort his destroyed hometown and begin to rebuild his house of worship			2
@entity17 needs heaven to speak to him , for he must preside over @entity0 's first mass burials in memory			1
behind his temple , the sound of heavy machinery digging giant ditches for unmarked coffins echoes through the shattered remains of the 300 - year - old building			0
" we do n't have enough places to cremate the bodies , " says @entity17			1
" so temporarily , we 're burying the bodies here			1
" the ditches sit within 50 meters of the @entity7 burial plots , where cremated remains lie underneath grey headstones			1
this is a sacred practice that every @entity1 person expects at death , explains @entity17			0
a @entity1 funeral is elaborate , formal , and ritualized in the @entity7 faith			1
so the wide ditches and the coffins , which will eventually lie in them side by side , are an unbearable insult in the minds of ordinary @entity1 citizens			0
but ordinary expectations have been abandoned in @entity1 's tsunami zone , where entire towns were decimated by a wall of water that struck in the wake of a magnitude - 9.0 earthquake march 11			0
" i feel very sad about this , " says @entity17 , adding that the mass graves are only one component of the overwhelming pain felt throughout @entity0			1
" my friends and my temple members , i do n't know yet how many of them i lost			0
and the town is destroyed			2
i 'm concerned if we can rebuild			0
" @entity17 does n't look like the monk of this temple , wearing a fisherman 's boots and winter coat			0
the tsunami destroyed all of his robes			0
like many of the tsunami victims mourning the dead , he ca n't dress in proper funeral attire			2
@entity17 says he will still try to administer the most respectful service he can offer to the survivors who will line the ditches			0
but he knows in the minds of many of those families , it will never replace a proper @entity1 @entity7 ceremony			1
however , city health leaders say they have no choice but to bury the dead in mass graves			1
thousands of bodies pulled from the rubble have been stored in school gymnasiums - turned - morgues			2
about 17,000 people remain missing , so officials believe more bodies will be recovered			1
even if they can be identified , the crematoriums on @entity1 's northern coastline are either damaged from the tsunami or already full			0
a shortage of gas has meant bodies ca n't be taken to other parts of the country for cremation			2
stressing the burials will be temporary , cities have begun the process of placing bodies in mass graves to prevent disease outbreak			1
@entity112 , searching through @entity0 's morgues for his brother , says it hurts his heart to think of his kin lying in a mass grave			1
but there is a greater indignity , he says			0
" my one hope is to find his body , " says @entity112			0
" if he remains missing , we 'll never really know			0
even if he 's in a mass grave , at least then , we 'll know			2

@entity7 funerals *typically* are *highly* ritualized
the town of @entity0 lacks the *resources* to cremate the dead
the bodies must be buried in mass graves to prevent a disease outbreak
officials say the mass burials are temporary
