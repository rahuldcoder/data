if you have ambitions of being one of the first people on @entity4 , listen up : a @entity6 company says it is moving along with its plan to send four lucky @entity8 to colonize the @entity4			1
the catch : they wo n't ever come back			0
the @entity12 foundation announced tuesday that it has secured lead suppliers for an unmanned mission launching in 2018 , which involves a robotic lander and a communications satellite			1
@entity17 has been contracted to study building the lander , and @entity19 will develop a concept study for the satellite , @entity12 said			1
this first mission will demonstrate technology that would be involved in a permanent human settlement on @entity4			1
if all goes well -- and that 's still very much an " if " -- the first pioneers could land on @entity4 in 2025			1
enthusiasm has been growing since the project 's first big announcement in april			0
more than 200,000 people have signed up to be prospective astronauts , @entity12 ceo @entity30 said in @entity33 on tuesday			1
apparently , they 're ok with living out the rest of their lives on @entity4			1
the technology for a return flight does n't exist -- there 's no @entity42 launch pad over there ! -- and having a one - way trip greatly reduces costs , the company has said			2
the application period is now closed , and by the end of this year , the company plans to notify those special folk who made it to @entity51			0
the unmanned mission is the " most important and most difficult step of actually getting humans to @entity4 , " @entity30 said			1
it would also be the first privately funded planetary exploration mission			2
" the opportunity to participate in that is just really exciting , " said @entity57 , a chief engineer at @entity58			0
@entity61 expects that the majority of funding for the unmanned missions will come from sponsors and partners , not public contributions			2
the cost of the lander and satellite will be something that the contracted companies will study , although @entity12 has a ballpark figure in mind , @entity30 said			0
@entity75 finds life - supporting chemicals what they want to send in 2018 the lander will be based on the successful @entity82 @entity81 mission , @entity30 said			1
the @entity12 probe will feature a robotic arm carrying a camera that will shoot continuous video , as well as a water experiment that will demonstrate the production of liquid water on the surface of @entity4			1
" the highest priority is to actually have liquid water on @entity4 , " he said			1
this unmanned mission will also carry the winning projects from an experiment contest			1
there will be a worldwide university challenge giving teams the chance to propose tests to carry out on @entity4			1
these could be science experiments , of course , but @entity12 is also interested in " fun " experiments			0
one of @entity30 's visions , for instance , is a balloon with a camera attached to it that would film @entity4 from an altitude of 200 to 500 meters , which has never been done			1
the communications satellite will provide live video feed from surface of @entity4 to @entity113 , representing the first @entity4 synchronous communications satellite , @entity30 said			2
tourist trips to the @entity116 by 2043 ? getting to @entity4 @entity12 was originally slated to land the first humans in 2023 , but the project has been delayed			2
after the first humans arrive in 2025 , the plan is send additional crews every two years , @entity30 said			0
right now , the idea is to send crews of four , but eventually bigger vehicles may become available to transport more people			2
is there enough time to get the lander and satellite on their way by 2018 ? @entity57 said it takes about 3Â½ years from commitment to initiating a preliminary design to launch , so that gives his company about a year of leeway to study this concept before promising to execute it			2
that timeline is " pretty favorable , " he said tuesday			0
but as to whether it 's enough time to develop the science side of things , that 's " a little tricky , " he said			0
it takes money @entity12 is looking at " a range of funding scenarios			0
" the total estimated budget for getting the first four humans to @entity4 is $ 6 billion			2
@entity61 would not disclose how much money has been secured from partners and sponsors but said donations currently total more than $ 200,000			0
a reality tv concept may help recoup costs			0
@entity30 noted that @entity12 will have the most unique video " available in the solar system , " which has a lot of value , and he hopes this will attract sponsors and partners			0
media coverage will be a main funding source			0
but will the money come through ? will the technology really be developed by 2018 for the unmanned mission and to send people there by 2025 ? will four humans survive the journey in a tight space capsule and embrace a desolate planet as their home ? as @entity30 himself said tuesday , " you ca n't go to @entity4 on excitement			1
" time will tell whether prospective applicants can go at all			0
follow @entity180 at @ lizlandau			0

more than 200,000 people say they want to go to @entity4
the first mission will be unmanned , planned for 2018 launch
@entity17 , @entity19 are studying concepts
