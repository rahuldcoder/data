@entity0 -- it ca n't be			0
the @entity4 's wise new sage on immigration is ... @entity6 ? in a recent interview with @entity10 , the @entity12 - language television network , the former presidential candidate -- whom some suspect may be gearing up to run again in 2016 -- criticized president @entity14 's use of executive action to temporarily re-prioritize deportations			1
nothing new here , folks			0
most @entity4 posed the same criticism , even at the cost of looking like hypocrites for contradicting their @entity23 - era views in favor of expanding executive power			1
one minute , republicans are threatening not to work with @entity14 on any issue ; the next , they 're whining that @entity14 did n't wait around to work with them on immigration			1
and i thought elephants were supposed to have good memories			0
in the @entity10 interview , @entity6 also said that permanent immigration reform was " badly needed " and urged @entity4 in @entity37 to pass legislation that will make " more transparent " the process by which illegal immigrants can obtain residency			1
" maybe even then , " @entity6 said , " republicans will swallow hard and say , ' ok , even despite the fact that we now have a stick in our eye launched by the president , we 're going to go ahead and try and see if we ca n't make some improvements to the immigration system			1
' i hope we 're able to do that			0
" conservative radio hosts , who constantly demonstrate how poorly they understand the immigration issue , went ballistic			0
they tore into @entity6 , accusing him of capitulating to the left 's demands for " amnesty			1
" meanwhile , some of their callers , who often seem to understand the issue even less , insisted that @entity6 supported " an open border			2
" more than one right - wing commentator declared @entity6 's possible presidential bid over before it began			1
of course , what @entity6 said is completely reasonable			2
the immigration system is broken , and @entity4 should try to fix it			1
that 's what leaders and lawmakers are supposed to do			0
moreover , now that @entity14 has put @entity4 in " check " with his executive action , the only move they have left for " checkmate " is to pass an immigration bill that is more substantial than his executive action			1
republicans do n't have to give away the store and provide millions of people here illegally with citizenship , complete with voting privileges			0
they can approve work permits , and couple it with border security and those guest workers for which their friends in the business community have such an insatiable hunger			0
and , in the ramp up to 2016 , it would n't hurt the @entity4 to appear less hostile to @entity94 , both immigrants and the native - born			1
republicans should think of passing immigration reform as an investment for the future			1
still , there must be a mistake			0
you 're telling me that @entity6 is sounding like a grown - up when talking about immigration ? who knew that was possible ? in 2012 , whether it was on the campaign trail or in debates with fellow @entity4 , @entity6 often demagogued the issue to scare up votes from those who tremble at the thought that @entity116 is becoming more @entity94			1
the former governor of @entity118 said one wrong thing after another			0
remember when he made that tacky joke with donors , suggesting that he might " have a better shot at winning " the presidency if he were @entity94			0
@entity6 also promised that , if he were elected president and if @entity37 passed the @entity127 — a popular piece of legislation with @entity130 , which would have allowed undocumented students to stay in the country if they went to college or joined the military — that he would veto the bill			2
he attacked @entity137 gov. @entity136 for signing a law that allows illegal immigrants to pay in - state tuition at public colleges and universities			2
and then he blasted former house speaker @entity143 for proposing work permits for the undocumented and declaring that the @entity4 should n't split up families			1
@entity6 came off as cynical when his campaign put up a television ad that tried to discredit @entity136 by portraying him as chummy with former @entity150 president @entity149			1
and then he came across as hypocritical when it came out that , for all his fire - breathing against illegal immigrants , he had hired — to work on his house in @entity118 — a landscaping company that employed them			0
while other candidates were going out and trying to get @entity94 to pick them , @entity6 seemed to go out of his way to pick on @entity94			2
it 's no wonder that @entity6 — who , ironically , had a father who was born in @entity150 and a record of supporting immigration reform as @entity118 governor — became persona non grata with @entity94			1
on election day , the @entity4 pulled down only 27 percent of the @entity167 vote			2
even after the election , @entity6 's @entity167 " offensive " still was n't over			1
he had the gall in a post-election phone call with supporters to insist that the reason he did so poorly was because @entity14 gave @entity94 a bunch of freebies including @entity176 and " amnesty for the children of illegals			2
" when a candidate gets into a hole this deep with any group of voters , it 's almost impossible to get out			0
but , whether he runs for president again or not , @entity6 seems determined to try			0
and the first thing he 's doing is taking on immigration with an eye toward solutions as opposed to soundbites			0
when it comes to this contentious issue , i have no idea what brought @entity6 to his senses			0
but whatever it is , let 's hope that other @entity4 are exposed to it — and that it 's highly contagious .			2

@entity203 : in the 2012 election , @entity6 was a *backward* voice on immigration
he criticized @entity136 , @entity143 for ideas that helped immigrants , @entity203 says
@entity203 : this year , @entity6 is wisely calling on @entity4 to pass immigration reform
he says it 's the one smart way @entity4 can *respond* to @entity14 's executive action
