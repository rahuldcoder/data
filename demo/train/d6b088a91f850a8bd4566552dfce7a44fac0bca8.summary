@entity0 -- @entity3 activist @entity2 began a public hunger strike in the country 's capital friday , accompanied by thousands of cheering supporters			1
the 74 - year - old campaigner , who is seeking stronger anti-corruption measures in @entity3 , was greeted by crowds as he left a jailhouse in @entity0 earlier to make his way to the city 's large @entity13			1
he will stage the two - week protest there after police relaxed their conditions			1
supporters say he began fasting while still in jail			0
@entity2 traveled from the jail in an open - top truck decorated with @entity3 flags , as thousands of citizens marched along			1
before arriving at @entity13 -- known mostly as a venue for massive political rallies , demonstrations and religious festivals -- the campaigner visited the shrine to @entity31 , the man who led the nation 's independence struggle , to pay homage			0
flanked by admirers , he dropped petals and bowed at the memorial in a traditional @entity3 gesture of respect			2
once at the rain - lashed @entity13 , @entity2 sat on a makeshift podium with a large @entity31 backdrop as crowds carrying umbrellas hailed his arrival			1
addressing the crowds , he called his campaign @entity3 's " second fight for independence			2
" he said , " we got independence in 1947 and the white ( the @entity52 rulers ) left our country			0
but there 's no end to corruption , crime and looting			0
this is now our second fight for independence			0
whether or not i live , this fight will go on			0
" speaking earlier outside the jailhouse , dressed in his usual plain cotton attire , @entity2 had also made references to @entity3 's freedom movement , with passionate cries of " hail revolution and hail motherland			1
" his brief address at the gates of @entity75 prison , from which he was officially released three days ago , was almost drowned out by the crowd 's noise			0
anti-corruption campaigners have rejected legislation prepared by the federal government to create a citizen ombudsman , saying the bill , now in @entity83 , is too weak to tackle endemic graft in the system			2
led by @entity2 , they have been demanding a stronger institution that they say should be capable of tackling corruption @entity3 encounter in their daily lives			1
supporters see the elderly anti-corruption crusader as a second @entity31			0
his hunger strikes are also modelled after the protest mode @entity31 used in his movement against the colonial rule that ended in 1947			2
however , @entity3 leaders say @entity2 's demands undermine democracy , through his use of a protest tactic @entity31 used in very different circumstances			1
" i acknowledge that @entity105 ( mr. ) @entity2 may be inspired by high ideals in his campaign to set up a strong and effective @entity108 ( citizen ombudsman ) , " prime minister @entity102 told parliament on wednesday			0
" however , the path that he has chosen to impose his draft of a bill upon parliament is totally misconceived and fraught with grave consequences for our parliamentary democracy			0
" @entity2 was sent to jail on tuesday because he planned to stage his strike at a different public place without official permission , police said			1
but as support swelled for the activist , with thousands of people hitting the streets in @entity3 cities , authorities ordered his release within hours of his arrest			2
yet , in a rare show of protest , he refused to depart the jail until police agreed to allow him to stage his hunger strike in the open air as planned			1
the protesters ' call has sparked a debate in @entity3 over the role of democratic institutions			0
@entity2 's arrest also prompted televised discussions over the right to protest .			2
