' nervous ' authorities @entity27 took part in the student - led demonstrations in the summer of 1989 that ended in a tragic military crackdown on protestors in @entity23 's @entity7 on june 4 of that year			1
an official death toll has never been announced but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundred to thousands			1

@entity60 , a @entity2 researcher for @entity11 , said the arrests were " distressing			2
" " it is distressing when some middle - aged people had a small gathering in a private setting , trying to remember the people who died in @entity7 ... that even this kind of low key - event with moderate people is not allowed in @entity2 right now , " he said			1
" if having a small gathering in a private setting is ' picking a quarrel , ' then what is n't ? " i think ( the authorities ) are very nervous about the 25th anniversary of @entity7 and what it represents			1
" more arrests signs of an apparent crackdown appeared when press freedom advocate @entity80 and her son @entity81 were both taken away by authorities on april 24			0

another activist , @entity89 , was arrested in @entity90 on the same day as the @entity23 group , also on suspicion of " picking quarrels , " according to @entity11			1
" these charges and detentions lay bare just how little the @entity2 government 's attitudes towards human rights have changed since 1989 , " said @entity93 , @entity2 director at @entity94			1
when asked about criticism of @entity2 's human rights record , @entity101 spokesperson @entity100 told @entity0 that human rights should n't been viewed in the " criteria of the @entity106			1

moderates public discussion of the june 4 anniversary is still taboo in mainland @entity2 and it is never been publicly marked there , though an annual vigil is held in the @entity146 of @entity147			2
in the lead - up to the anniversary each year , many activists in @entity2 are typically held by police			1
but the recent detentions are unusual as the anniversary is still a month away and those targeted are considered moderates			0
in an interview with @entity0 in july last year , @entity27 dismissed the risks he could be taking with his work			0
" i think i am fine , i am a moderate , the government has treated me well and i am a veteran lawyer			0
i did n't make any mistakes in my career			0
i am not radical , i do not threaten the government			0
" " when you block the moderate channels you are pushing people to more extreme actions , " said @entity163 , researcher for the @entity164 of @entity94			0
" the government is detaining people who have acted as bridges between authorities and activists			0
it leaves the question of what authorities are able to tolerate and what avenues people have to complain			0
" while many activists initially hoped that president @entity183 would preside over a system more tolerant of dissent and discussion , his administration is widely seen as tightening the screws on the work of activists and intellectuals , including the sentencing of @entity192 , another human rights lawyer pushing for financial transparency of @entity2 's leaders , to four years in prison in january			1
@entity0 's @entity196 contributed to this report .			0
