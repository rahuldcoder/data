-- is president @entity1 running against the @entity2 or the gdp ? in exactly one year -- november 6 , 2012 -- we 'll be lining up at polling places to cast our votes for the next president			1
how much of that decision will be determined by economic data and poll numbers ? some of the smartest political pros believe you can gauge a president 's chances of re-election by looking at just a couple of key indicators -- job approval , unemployment and growth in gross domestic product			1
plug in the data and you get the election outcome -- pure , unsentimental and simple			0
to test this theory , i compared @entity1 's standing right now with those of recent past presidents one year before the re-election vote			2
here 's what i found : there is no reason for overconfidence at @entity1 election headquarters -- the man is presiding over a historically bad economy			2
but his popularity numbers could be worse , and a lot can change in a year			0
the most important factor is the momentum heading into @entity42 -- and yes , the opponent matters			0
for example , at about 1,000 days into their terms , according to @entity49 , presidents @entity44 and @entity46 had mediocre approval ratings of 49 % -- roughly one year out from their landslide 49 - state re-elections in 1972 and 1984 , respectively			1
running against @entity54 and @entity55 , two weak candidates , certainly helped their efforts			0
@entity58 was also at 49 % approval one year before his 1996 victory over @entity61			1
@entity1 's 45 % approval rating this week is a tick up from his third quarter average of 2011			1
he 's doing better than the two one - term presidents of the 1970s			0
@entity66 was at 44 % in the wake of @entity68 and desperate promises to " @entity70			2
" @entity71 was mired in the @entity73 hostage crisis with a rock - bottom job approval rate of 32 % , despite a relatively decent unemployment rate of 5.9 %			2
so here 's a reality check : @entity1 has never been anywhere near that low			2
the biggest cautionary tale comes from the first president @entity81			0
he was riding high at 62 % one year out from his 1992 loss			2
but euphoria from victory in the first @entity85 gave way to resentment over a relatively brief recession			2
unemployment was about 7 % in 1991 -- two points lower than now			0
gdp growth in the third quarter of 1991 was 1.7 % , up from negative 1.9 % in the first quarter			1
the 2.5 % gdp growth in the third quarter of 2011 looks pretty good by comparison			1
but @entity58 was able to campaign successfully against @entity81 over the recession in 1992 , despite 4 % gdp growth that year			1
sometimes the narrative gets so established that it ca n't be dislodged			0
the closest unemployment rate to today 's 9 % was @entity46 's 8.5 % in 1983 -- but that was down from over 10 percent the previous year			1
the trend was @entity46 's friend -- gdp growth was rocketing at 8 percent in the third quarter of ' 83 and continued at that clip into early ' 84 -- all of which made it feel like " morning in @entity109			1
" so where does @entity1 stand in this hall of presidents ? his approval rating is in the murky area between the one - and two - termers , but given the historically high unemployment rate , it 's remarkable that his job approval is n't lower			1
one explanation for this bit of gravity defiance is that @entity1 's personal approval rating remains quite high -- nearly 70 %			1
but that makes him susceptible to the election - year argument that @entity125 is starting to make : nice guy , good family , but it 's time to give someone else a chance to turn the economy around			0
the economy is finally showing some signs of improving , but it 's not happening fast enough to add meaningfully to consumer confidence			0
and @entity135 's continued economic instability threatens to tank whatever glimmer of a recovery there is			0
while unemployment will hopefully continue to decline toward 8 % or lower , it 's hard to imagine that we 'll see the kind of gdp growth that boosted @entity46 in 1984 or @entity58 in 1996			1
" the worst is over " is n't the most inspirational re-election slogan			0
likewise , the recent bump in approval ratings president @entity1 has enjoyed -- from 41 % to 45 % -- is nothing to really cheer about at the @entity150			1
it is due to three factors that could fade : the vindication of his intervention in @entity156 ( foreign policy is an unexpected bright spot in this administration ) ; the food - fight chaos among the @entity2 candidates ; and , yes , the modestly positive economic data			0
there 's an additional headwind that president @entity1 faces -- 40 % percent of @entity109 call themselves conservative while just 20 % describe themselves as liberal			1
the landslides of the past 40 years have come from @entity2 -- @entity44 and @entity46 -- while @entity58 was the first @entity166 re-elected since @entity167 and never broke 50 % of the popular vote , in large part because of @entity171 's two independent campaigns			1
it does n't take a crystal ball -- or reams of data -- to say that the 2012 presidential election is going to be close			0
by any historical measure @entity1 is a very vulnerable incumbent			2
nonetheless , he has withstood tough economic winds without his popularity completely collapsing and he has the comparative benefit of a weak @entity2 field			0
but if a week is a long time in politics ( just ask @entity182 ) , a year is a lifetime			0
we are in for a wild election ride , and a long election night one year from today			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			2

@entity189 : can one predict presidential chances by gdp growth , approval , jobs ?
he says @entity44 , @entity46 overcame poor approval ratings
@entity189 : @entity58 hit @entity199 over a small recession
@entity1 faces strong headwinds in a 40 % conservative electorate
