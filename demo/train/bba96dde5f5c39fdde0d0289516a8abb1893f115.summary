@entity0 -- as a reproductive rights advocate and a proud mother of two , my blood ran cold as i read about @entity7 's new abortion legislation ( @entity8 2656 )			1
the state of @entity7 just decided , and by an appallingly high margin i might add , that a doctor is protected from being sued if he or she chooses not to tell a woman that the baby she is carrying has a birth defect			1
state legislators made this decision tuesday , voting 36 - 12 in the @entity18 and 84 - 12 in the @entity19 to override gov. @entity21 's veto of this law			1
( the @entity23 also overrode the governor 's veto of a second egregious law , @entity8 2780 , which forces women to view an ultrasound before having an abortion			1
) @entity7 , what have you done ? under this new law , a doctor may withhold information , mislead or even blatantly lie to a pregnant woman and her partner about the health of their baby if the doctor so much as thinks that fetal test results would cause a woman to consider abortion			1
as expected , the anti-abortion movement is claiming victory			0
but this bill is n't " anti-abortion			0
" it is devastating because it is anti-motherhood and anti-medicine			0
when i found out i was pregnant with each of my children , like every woman who has ever undergone fetal testing , i held my breath at each doctor 's appointment			1
i did n't let it go until the doctor or the tech said , " everything looks great			2
" i seized up when they took out the blood work results and i did n't relax until i heard , " it all came back negative			0
" but a woman in @entity7 no longer gets to exhale			2
because now , when a doctor says , " everything looks fine , " she has to wonder ; does it really ? @entity7 politicians have now said that she can no longer count on the sacred trust that always existed between her and her doctor			1
a doctor may now lie to her face and , in doing so , deny a woman what is quite possibly the most important piece of information she will ever receive in her life			1
the very thought makes my breath catch even now			0
the information you get on those visits matters to every woman getting prenatal care , regardless of what she decides to do based upon the results			2
the legislators have decided that a woman , when she becomes pregnant , loses the right to full , honest information from her doctor			2
it is her right to know this information			0
it is how she and her family determine what to do next , not only to decide if they want to continue a pregnancy , but also to consider how they will prepare to care for a special needs child			0
what specialist will they turn to ? what support will they require ? who will hold their hand in the delivery room if a child is born who will only live an hour , or a day ? does she want to call her own mom in from across the country or does she want to grieve silently with her partner ? what will they tell the children they already have ? does n't every family have the right to the information that may help them decide the course of their future or the future of their child ? according to the @entity23 , they no longer do			0
these politicians have decided they know best what women need			0
i ask each politician in @entity7 who voted yes on this bill : how dare you ? how dare you deny a woman the peace of mind that her baby is healthy ? how dare you not give her and her family time to prepare if , @entity143 forbid , her baby is not ? how is this bill " pro-life " ? how is this mockery of medical care and paternalistic devaluing of women , " pro-life " ? this bill is anti-mom , it 's anti-doctor and it is anti-family			1
and all women , regardless of how they feel about abortion , should be appalled			0
i hope the courts stand up for the women and families whom politicians have turned their backs on and find this law unconstitutional and flat - out wrong			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			2

@entity163 says new @entity7 abortion law protects doctors who lie from lawsuits
doctor may withhold information that he or she believes would prompt an abortion , she says
the law is paternalistic *incursion* that *violates* doctor - *patient* relationship , she says
@entity163 : @entity7 politicians mock medicine ; law should be found unconstitutional
