-- the white plastic macbook is officially dead for good after @entity2 notified resellers that it will no longer be available to educational institutions			2
the 13 - inch machine was essentially killed off for most of the public last july , but the budget laptop continued to be available to schools for the last six months			1
now , however , the machine has officially been @entity9 'd ( end of @entity10 ) , bringing the old @entity12 legacy to an end once and for all			0
as noted by @entity15 , @entity2 informed resellers of the product @entity9 on wednesday , saying they had ended the educational distribution channel for the machine			1
it 's unlikely that @entity2 has been actively manufacturing white macbooks up to this point , either -- it 's not public how long the company did manufacture it ( if at all ) past last july , but its cancellation this week was likely due to the end of whatever remaining supply was available			0
when @entity2 made the white @entity29 unavailable to the public last year , it was on the same day the company introduced its 11 - inch @entity32 for $ 999 -- the same price the as the @entity29			2
@entity2 does n't typically like to sell @entity34 for much cheaper than that for extended periods of time , so it was only a matter of time before the white @entity29 bid the world farewell			0
