if @entity2 's @entity1 leaks led to changes in government policy , increased civil liberties protections and sparked a national dialogue , does it stand to reason that @entity2 is more whistleblower and patriot than traitor ? we know where president @entity12 stands			1
even as he announced changes to the @entity1 programs , including the appointment of an independent government review , at a news conference on friday , @entity12 suggested @entity19 would be better off if they had n't found out that the government collects vast amounts of phone and @entity24 data			1
" no , i do n't think mr. @entity2 was a patriot , " @entity12 said			1
a bit earlier he had argued that his administration was already in the process of reviewing the programs that most @entity19 did n't know existed			1
the leaks , he said , hurt that process			0
" i called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before mr. @entity2 made these leaks , " @entity12 said			1
" my preference , and i think the @entity19 people 's preference , would have been for a lawful , orderly examination of these laws ; a thoughtful fact - based debate that would then lead us to a better place			1
" @entity12 : @entity2 can make his case in court @entity2 , who has been granted temporary asylum in @entity47 , has n't spoken up about the president 's remarks , but his father did so on @entity51			1
" much of what he suggested is superficial , " @entity52 said			0
more specifically , he called the idea that @entity2 could have been protected as a whistleblower " absolutely untrue			1
" @entity2 's father reacts to @entity12 statement @entity52 appeared on @entity51 with his lawyer , @entity58 , who said the idea that congressional committees , which knew about the classified telephone and e-mail surveillance programs that @entity2 disclosed through leaks to media , would have protected him as a whistleblower , is absurd			1
" these were the committees that knew for seven years what was going on and refused to disclose it to the @entity19 people , " said @entity58			2
" the best was some cryptic statements if the @entity19 people knew what was going on they would be stunned			2
and @entity2 is supposed to go to them ? that seems rather implausible because they were the ones who were responsible for the secrecy			2
" @entity1 : we read .00004 % of web traffic @entity12 is clearly sensitive to the idea he might be overlooking civil liberties			1
@entity2 , the president argued , should have utilized the federal government 's system for whistleblowers instead of leaking classified information			1
and the president offered his own support for whistleblower protections for government employees in the intelligence community as evidence that he and his administration want whistleblowers to come forward			2
those are two important points @entity12 has made : first , that he was already reviewing the programs and second , that @entity2 should have stayed in the @entity19 to make his case either as a whistleblower within the intelligence infrastructure or to @entity101 and also in court with a lawyer by his side			1
here 's a look at both of them : would @entity12 's whistleblower protection have helped @entity2 ? @entity12 on friday : " i signed an executive order well before mr. @entity2 leaked this information that provided whistleblower protection to the intelligence community for the first time			1
" true -- he signed an executive order in october of 2012 that protects intelligence community whistleblowers			0
the intelligence community is exempted from other whistleblower protections he signed into law in 2012			0
read the executive order but that protection does not appear to do much for someone like @entity2 , who wanted to blow the whistle to public on a classified program			1
the order states that classified information should be protected			0
it also adjudicates through the intelligence committee , which is already complicit and agrees with the program that he disclosed			0
in other words , @entity2 would have been protected in blowing the whistle up to the director of @entity135			1
currently , that 's @entity137 , who has had to apologize for misleading @entity101 about the existence of the programs			0
in any case , he already knew about the programs			0
so that does seem like a bit of a @entity144			0
but it is part of a larger debate about whether @entity19 trust their government to have secret programs			2
if so , they have to trust the branches of government to do the checking and balancing			0
@entity155 chief admits ' erroneous statements ' to @entity101 what review of intelligence did @entity12 order in may ? @entity12 said friday the intelligence programs at the @entity1 were already under review before @entity2 's leaks			1
he pointed to a speech he gave in may at @entity164 as public proof			0
that speech was given in the wake of the terror attack by two brothers , one an @entity19 citizen , on the @entity171			2
it was more in line with strengthening capabilities of the intelligence community than it was an examination of civil liberties			0
@entity12 did raise concerns about press freedoms from a separate instance where the @entity181 had sought phone records of @entity183 as it investigated a leak of classified information about a terror plot emanating from @entity187			2
perhaps the fact that the @entity181 sought warrants for the data the government had apparently already collected is proof that government safeguards were working			0
but there was no mention in that speech about reviewing the necessity of collecting mass amounts of data from @entity19			2
of course , nobody really knew at that point about the @entity1 programs			2
here 's the relevant excerpt from that may speech : " thwarting homegrown plots presents particular challenges in part because of our proud commitment to civil liberties for all who call @entity19 home			1
that 's why , in the years to come , we will have to keep working hard to strike the appropriate balance between our need for security and preserving those freedoms that make us who we are			0
that means reviewing the authorities of law enforcement , so we can intercept new types of communication , but also build in privacy protections to prevent abuse			0
" that means that -- even after @entity226 -- we do not deport someone or throw somebody in prison in the absence of evidence			0
that means putting careful constraints on the tools the government uses to protect sensitive information , such as the state secrets doctrine			0
and that means finally having a strong privacy and @entity240 to review those issues where our counterterrorism efforts and our values may come into tension			0
" read @entity12 's full speech at @entity164 the review @entity12 announced friday -- charging an independent group within 60 days " to step back and review our capabilities , particularly our surveillance technologies			1
" that seems more on point .			0

president suggested @entity19 would have been better off if they had n't found out about @entity1 program
@entity2 's father rejects @entity12 's suggestion that he would have been protected
federal whistleblower protection does n't appear to help someone in @entity2 's case
