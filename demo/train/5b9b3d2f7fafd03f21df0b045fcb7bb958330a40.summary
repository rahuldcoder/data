-- it 's clear from the coverage of the nomination of former sen. @entity4 for the 24th secretary of defense that many of those opposing him do not know him personally , as i do			1
the facts speak for themselves : his record shows strong support for @entity14			1
as a person who grew up in @entity14 and now as a rabbi in our home state of @entity19 for the past 25 years , i have found a great love in @entity4 's heart for the @entity14 people and their desire to live in peace and security			1
in numerous encounters , i was enthralled with the depth of his knowledge , the strength of his convictions , the integrity of his character and the honesty in his search for peace			0
take the matter of recent accusations against him , which say that as president of the @entity42 in the late 1980s , @entity4 went on a crusade to close a @entity42 post in the @entity14 port city of @entity46			1
an organization most associated with @entity48 , the @entity42 is a private , nonprofit whose mission is to support @entity51 troops by providing morale , welfare and recreation - type services			0
@entity4 's tenure there is remembered for turning around a financially troubled organization and bringing it back to fiscal health in the lead up to @entity60			1
when @entity62 magazine recently conducted an investigative report , both the longtime director of the @entity42 mission in @entity46 and a former commander in chief of the @entity14 @entity67 came to his defense			2
reversing the fortunes of a near - bankrupt organization requires making tough choices , and there may have been some logic in closing that outpost , but in this case , the @entity46 operation was kept open and 10 other operations were closed in the @entity78			0
in fact , it was not until 2002 , near the end of @entity4 's first term in the @entity83 , that the @entity42 's @entity46 office was closed			1
@entity85 : @entity86 is wrong on why @entity51 supports @entity14 others have pointed out that as a @entity51 senator , he opposed sanctions against @entity92 , an example frequently used to show that he was not being supportive of @entity14			1
@entity92 has been on my mind for a long time			0
the danger is clear for the security of @entity14 and the entire @entity98			2
but i know @entity4 's preference is for multilateral sanctions over unilateral sanctions , and what 's wrong with that ? @entity104 is a prime example of decades of unilateral sanctions not working			1
@entity51 need only go to cities on or near the @entity108 border such as @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 to purchase the famed @entity104 cigars			0
but when dealing with @entity92 , we do not have decades to wait the regime out			0
like @entity4 , i would rather have the world powers behind a united effort to stop and reverse the nuclear ambitions of @entity92 's leadership			2
i use these two examples to show that accusations against him of being anti-semitic and not being supportive of @entity14 are groundless			2
as a student of world history in general and @entity127 history in particular and as one who knows and abhors anti-semitism , i think it cheapens the lives and the memories of my people when the label is attached and used on someone who may not share the same policy views as those opposing his nomination			0
it is despicable and revolting when name - calling becomes more important than the substance at hand			0
we , all children created in @entity145 's image , need to be extremely careful in uttering words that hurt and make sure to introduce only words that heal			0
indeed , a real friend of anyone , including @entity14 , is supposed to be frank and offer counsel , especially when there is so much at stake			0
finally , @entity51 support for @entity14 is best when it is bipartisan , as it has been historically			2
recent efforts to smear @entity4 get us further away from support for @entity14 being a bipartisan issue , and ultimately that hurts the long - term security of the state of @entity14			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of rabbi @entity164 .			1

@entity4 's nomination has been *criticized* on issue of support for @entity14
@entity19 rabbi @entity164 says he 's long seen @entity86 's backing for @entity14
he says **critics** of @entity86 are *grasping* at straws to *question* his views
@entity164 : **critics** are wrong to hurl charges of @entity179 against @entity86
