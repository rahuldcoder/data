in a speech celebrating the birthday of the @entity10 , which coincided with @entity12 , he said they had no time to lose			1
" i say and repeat , again , that we are in need of a religious revolution			2
you imams are responsible before @entity19			0
the entire world is waiting on you			0
the entire world is waiting for your word ... because the @entity24 world is being torn , it is being destroyed , it is being lost			0
and it is being lost by our own hands , " @entity0 said			1
" we need a revolution of the self , a revolution of consciousness and ethics to rebuild the @entity1 person -- a person that our country will need in the near future , " the president said			1
@entity0 , himself a pious man , was elected in may after leaving the military to run for the office			1
a former defense minister , he led the ouster of @entity43 -- the @entity44 who was @entity1 's first democratically elected president -- and has long positioned himself as a more secular option , and defender against extremist views			2
" it 's inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire @entity24 world to be a source of anxiety , danger , killing and destruction for the rest of the world			0
impossible that this thinking -- and i am not saying the religion -- i am saying this thinking , " @entity0 said			1
he continued : " this is antagonizing the entire world			0
it 's antagonizing the entire world ! does this mean that 1.6 billion people ( @entity5 ) should want to kill the rest of the world 's inhabitants -- that is 7 billion -- so that they themselves may live ? impossible ! ​ " while @entity0 's speech included some powerful language , @entity73 , a nonresident fellow at the @entity74 at the @entity75 and research associate at the @entity77 at @entity78 , said the president has made similar statements in the past			1
" there is little to suggest ( @entity0 ) is interested in some sort of @entity84 of @entity24			1
by all accounts , he 's quite comfortable with the prevailing leadership of the @entity88 establishment			0
" if anything , he wants to empower it further in order to push forward a counternarrative against radical @entity44			0
the real question is : how credible can such a state - empowered counternarrative be ? " @entity73 said			0
on tuesday , the president visited the main @entity97 cathedral in @entity98 to attend a @entity100 mass and make a short speech			2
he is the first president to attend such a mass since the revolution			1
