-- the latest string of fatal shark attacks in @entity3 is creating a climate of fear that could haphazardly undo a very important environmental law that protects great white sharks			1
last weekend , 24 - year - old surfer @entity8 was attacked by a great white near @entity10 , becoming the fifth fatality off that coast in the past 10 months			1
in response , the @entity3 fishing minister , @entity13 , promised to write the federal government " to know if there has been any update on the status of the white sharks and the sustainability level at which the @entity21 will lift protection			1
" if mr. @entity13 has his way , hundreds if not thousands of sharks will be killed in @entity3			1
i have a problem with that			0
yes , my heart goes out to the victims ' families and friends who are mourning the losses of these tragic events , and i in no way downplay the pain and sadness an attack has on an entire community			1
shark attacks : is ' jaws ' back ? i know , as i lost my leg and nearly my life after being attacked by a large tiger shark here in @entity45			1
i do feel that these predators play a very important role in the health of our oceans , and i strongly oppose any type of shark hunting or culling program			1
by fishing for the great white shark , the bycatch will surely be a bunch of other shark species that have never had a history of munching on people			1
they did a shark culling program in @entity45 in the 1960s and early ' 70s , and 4,668 sharks were killed			2
only 554 were the targeted species , the tiger shark			2
if a judge put one criminal along with eight innocent people on death row for a murder , would that be justice ? and what if the guilty criminal was found guilty only because he belonged to the same race as the suspect in the crime ? this type of rationale does n't make sense , and it surely does n't do anything to solve the crime			0
white sharks , by most scientific studies , have been shown not to be territorial			2
the shark that attacked @entity8 is very probably hundreds of miles away , quite possibly in the waters of another country			2
the odds of a culling program capturing the same animal responsible for any one of the attacks is very slim			0
@entity96 , the dominant predators in the sea , by nature need to be on the move to be efficient eaters			0
the element of surprise is their weapon of choice , and if they hang in the same area for too long the fish get spooked and they lose out on an easy meal			0
moving ensures a more efficient way of consuming food			0
great whites tracked off of @entity3 's northwestern coast have been known to travel to @entity111 , and have been recorded traveling more than 12,000 miles in just nine months			1
@entity112 bans shark fin soup from banquets in @entity3 , the great white is protected by both domestic and international law , having been cited as " vulnerable " by the @entity117 in 1996			1
in 2002 , with input from scientists , environmentalists , fisheries , and fishermen , @entity3 's government initiated the @entity124			2
this law took a long time to be put into place , and undoing it would jeopardize the marine ecosystem			1
any marine biologist will tell you that a healthy shark population equals a healthy marine ecosystem			1
sharks predate dinosaurs , and millions of years of evolution have positioned them in a critical and vital role as an apex predator			0
predator removal can cause a cascading effect that destabilizes the entire marine food web and , in turn , our oceans			0
great whites are slow to mature and have very few offspring , so any type of culling program , even if done for a limited amount of time , would put their existence in peril			0
from what i have learned about @entity8 , his entire life revolved around the ocean			0
and so do those of millions of other people across the globe who surf , fish , swim , dive and feel more comfortable in water than on land			0
the ocean is a complex web of marine life , with many species being driven to extinction year after year			0
for humans and sharks to coexist is for us to respect their place on @entity173			0
join us at @entity175 / @entity174 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			2

five have died in shark attacks off @entity3 in the past 10 months , says @entity178
as a shark - attack *survivor* myself , i feel these losses *keenly* , @entity178 says
@entity188 : still , a healthy shark population equals a healthy marine ecosystem
@entity193 law protects the great white , and that law must stay , @entity178 says
