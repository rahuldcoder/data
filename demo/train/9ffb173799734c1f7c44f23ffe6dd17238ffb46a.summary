the @entity0 filed a lawsuit monday seeking to block parts of a new @entity4 voting law that tightens election procedures , including requiring photo identification to cast ballots			1
@entity0 officials said the @entity4 law is discriminatory in intent and effect			1
the suit challenges four parts of the law and asks a court to require @entity4 to obtain pre-approval for certain voting law changes under a part of the @entity19 that remains in effect			1
the lawsuit is part of attorney general @entity24 's response to a june @entity26 ruling that struck down a @entity19 requirement for a patchwork of states and local jurisdictions to get permission from the @entity0 or a federal judge before enacting voting law changes			1
@entity4 lawmakers approve controversial election changes the four sections in dispute are : the requirement of photo id to cast ballots ; the shortening of early voting from 17 days to 10 ; the elimination of same - day voter registration during early voting ; and restrictions on counting some provisional ballots			1
the photo id portion of the @entity4 law was the center of controversy because @entity51 said that it did n't include protections for voters who do n't have identification and that it disproportionately would affect minority voters			1
conservatives have pushed such photo id requirements in many states , saying they would prevent vote fraud			1
studies of recent elections have shown in - person vote fraud to be rare			0
some voter photo id laws have been upheld by the courts			2
in august , the @entity0 filed similar lawsuits against @entity66 seeking to block the state 's 2011 election redistricting plan and a new voter photo id law			1
the federal government is also seeking to require @entity66 to seek future pre-approval for voting law changes			0
@entity4 gov. @entity73 signed the voting law changes last month			2
@entity73 's office issued a statement on monday with a link to a video showing president @entity79 being asked for and presenting his driver 's license at an @entity82 polling station before voting in the 2012 presidential election			0
" i believe if showing a voter id is good enough and fair enough for our own president in @entity82 , then it 's good enough for the people in @entity4 , " @entity73 said			2
he said @entity4 is in line with a majority of states with voter id laws , and said voters without identification will be able to get free identification cards from the state in january			2
" protecting the integrity of every vote is one of the most important duties i have as governor of this great state			0
and that is why i signed this common sense legislation into law , " @entity73 said			0
in a speech earlier this month at a convention of the @entity108 , @entity24 repeated his criticism of the june high court ruling on the @entity19 , calling it " a deeply flawed decision that effectively invalidated a cornerstone of @entity114 civil rights law			0
" he said despite the ruling , the @entity0 would find ways to try to accomplish the goals of the section of the law that was struck down			0
" we will continue to vigorously enforce federal voting laws not affected by the @entity26 's decision -- including all remaining parts of the @entity19 , " @entity24 said			1
the @entity26 called the pre-clearance portion of the law unconstitutional in part because of its disparate treatment of the affected states			0
the ruling left standing other portions of the 1965 law , which was reauthorized by @entity132 and signed by president @entity133 in 2006			0
@entity4 governor brushes off criticism amid weekly protests			0

@entity4 passed stricter voting rules after parts of the @entity19 were struck
