who could have believed that a @entity2 movie directed by an @entity3 that examines more than 60 years of socio - political history through the life of an @entity3 @entity8 butler would have happened , much less been released toward summer 's end ? and that it would become the talk of the nation as both " oscar bait " and cultural signifier ? oh ... and make more money in its opening weekend than anybody , including its producers , expected ? even before it opened nationwide friday , " @entity20 " seemed far more than just another @entity2 period melodrama			1
in a summer where racial reckoning manifested itself in major and minor events ( the @entity26 verdict and the @entity28 sideshow ) , the movie promised to be a kind of cultural signpost , an occasion for still more soul - searching and commemoration leading to this month 's 50th anniversary of the march on @entity34			1
it even became grist for a rare front - page essay last week in the @entity37 written by film critic @entity38 , who declared the movie a groundbreaker for being the " first major feature film to capture the full sweep and scope of the civil rights movement			1
" ' the @entity45 ' reflects @entity47 's racial conversations the movie 's thoroughgoing publicity campaign made it an unavoidable fact of life , thanks largely to its female lead , @entity53 , who through boisterous appearances on almost every nationally - televised talk show made herself as unavoidable a fact of life as she was when she had her own nationally - televised talk show between 1986 and 2011 -- which somehow seems a lot longer ago than it actually is			1
@entity53 's hard work likely was n't targeted at movie critics -- though if you go by the @entity66 website that assesses critical consensus , " @entity20 " has reaped a 73 percent " ripe " ( as in positive ) score -- though it 's also true that even some of those positive reviews are mixed in nature			2
while even some of the negative reviews have good things to say about the acting , especially from @entity76 in the title role of circumspect presidential servant @entity78 and @entity53 as his saucy , unsettled easy spouse @entity80 , even some of the positive reviews take to task some of the heavy - handed melodramatic flourishes applied to the story by @entity84 , whose previous work , 2008 's " precious " and last year 's " @entity86 " , drew critical wrath for what were viewed as wretched , maudlin excesses			0
" @entity20 " itself may not have been every critic 's idea of a masterpiece			0
but its advance hype ( did i mention all the sunday supplement covers ? ) was certainly some kind of masterly work of art ; the kind whose only precedent for an @entity3 - made commercial film was the buildup orchestrated in large part by @entity105 for his 1994 biopic , " @entity107 " did it work ? put it this way : the most optimistic forecast for " @entity45 's " opening weekend was $ 15 million			1
it has so far earned more than $ 25 million , easily outdistancing such late - season action franchises as " @entity114 " ( $ 13.5 million )			0
though no industry pundit expects it to pass the magic blockbuster borderline of $ 100 million , " @entity20 " has already achieved enough capital , in money and buzz , to make people wonder whether it heralds yet another surge in serious commercial films about @entity3 - @entity3 life , past and present			0
10 secrets of ' the @entity45 ' we 've been down this road before ; several times , in fact , since the early 1990s when the emergence of @entity105 , @entity129 ( " @entity130 " ) and other young filmmakers - of - color heralded a renaissance of minority movies			2
what 's happened since those days has been at best a static , fitful process of advancement for black @entity47 in film with many in @entity2 convinced that movies with black - related themes are at best niche - market items with little if any staying power in a global movie bazaar where generic action movies and romantic comedies allegedly deliver bigger bangs for the buck			2
we will , as always , see			0
whatever the future holds for " @entity20 " , one groundbreaking fact remains : somehow , someway , a commercial feature film about the civil rights era was made by a black director with a predominantly black cast without a major white character being the focus of the narrative			1
so far , it 's working			0
and that means that , for the moment , anything 's possible .			0

@entity165 : opening weekend *success* of ' the @entity45 ' *surprising*
he says it comes at a time of national reckoning on race , with @entity26 , @entity28
movie reviews mixed , but hype masterly . does it mark renaissance of black films ?
it 's *stunning* that a film by and about blacks , civil rights made such a splash
