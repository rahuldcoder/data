semi-ambidextrous @entity0 rebelled against third - grade cursive lessons			1
" i remember i hated it and i told my teacher i thought it was dumb , " he says			0
@entity0 , now 26 , eventually learned to like using his left hand to inscribe strings of words			0
but typing papers while at the @entity10 and choosing a career rooted in technology drastically decreased the amount he wrote by hand , causing writing in cursive to become uncomfortable and painful			1
so he switched to printing right - handed while still signing his name with the left			1
" i do n't even think i know how to write in cursive anymore , " says @entity0 , who now lives and works in @entity18			0
technology is constantly increasing communication speeds , often anticipating words before our brains can send signals to our fingers			2
but experts say handwriting is being sacrificed for the sake of technology 's convenience			1
people like @entity0 say they communicate so much via laptops , phones and tablets that they rarely need to scribble a handwritten note			0
this trend is reinforced by a 2012 study that found 33 % of people had difficulty reading their own handwriting			1
@entity41 , a @entity43 - based printing and mailing company , conducted the study and concluded that one in three participants had not been required to produce something in handwriting for more than half a year			1
it also found that updating calendars , phone books and reminder notes was more likely to be completed without using a pen			0
finally , more than half of participants said their handwriting was noticeably declining			1
the state of handwriting in the @entity57 , which celebrates @entity58 every january 23 -- @entity60 's birthday -- is not much better , says @entity61 , a handwriting expert and forensic document examiner			1
@entity61 works as an expert court witness , maintaining offices in @entity66 and @entity67			0
she says the dramatic decline of handwriting is causing " great " deterioration of the mind			2
" @entity72 played a role in it because people are trying to write quick short sentences , " she says			0
" people are n't using their minds and they are relying on technology to make the decisions for them			2
" @entity61 says cursive writing combines mental and physical processes which involve both sides of the brain			0
she says she 's noticed that the number of people who write cursive decreases as technology becomes the most dominant means of communication			1
" if you are typing or texting , it 's a matter of punching and finger - moving , " she says			1
" you are doing very little thinking because you are not allowing your brain to form neural processes			0
" @entity96 is the founder and president of @entity98 , a company that creates handwriting curriculum guides and workbooks for teachers and students from kindergarten through fifth grade			2
she says handwriting , especially cursive , is viewed as old - fashioned by some			1
lernstift smartpen checks your spelling as you write " the only reason to write anything is to retrieve it later , " she said			0
" so you need to have it legible			0
" @entity114 requirements in @entity57 public schools have declined as access to technology increases			1
@entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 require cursive and several other states are considering it			0
the @entity126 reported in april that 45 states have adopted common core standards for education			1
such standards are designed to provoke thought while at the same time preparing students to pass standardized tests , but they do not include a cursive learning requirement			1
in other words , many kids today are growing up without having to learn the looping , elegant script that was demanded of their parents and grandparents			0
going forward , it will be up to individual states to decide whether to require cursive and then up to school districts to make it a focal part of the curriculum			0
burdened by budget cuts , it is likely many states and districts will choose to have students type instead of write			0
@entity96 , 72 , says the writing styles used in technology and handwriting conflict			1
texts and instant messages require use of communication @entity159 , while writing requires use of standard @entity159 , she says			1
" to achieve in the world , people need to use standard ( @entity159 )			1
" but the irony is that @entity96 , who communicates via text message on her @entity168 , says @entity98 must be tech - savvy to remain competitive			2
in addition to its workbooks , the company offers an electronic teaching guide and an app. " at work we have technology up the kazoo , " she says			2
nation of adults who will write like children ? @entity181 , a bank officer living in @entity182 , says that while technology allows instantaneous communication , he is nostalgic about handwriting due to its permanence and tangibility			1
" if there is no electricity , none of ( technology ) will work , " he says			2
" notebooks have served us for a couple thousand years			0
" @entity181 , a former civil servant , used to write for work , but has spent the last 23 years typing on a pc			2
he says it has negatively impacted his handwriting to the point that people would never guess he won a handwriting contest when he was a child			2
" it 's a shame that now when you write quickly it looks like it 's by someone who has not had an education , " he says			1
@entity181 , 52 , says he 's started using a fountain pen to try to improve his penmanship			2
" it 's got a lovely feel to it , " he says			2
" it 's not very practical			0
" @entity181 says he wants to recapture his ability to write cursive			0
@entity0 , however , is happy that printing allows him to write legibly			0
" my right - handed printing is not too terrible , " he says			0
" it 's slow , but readable			0
" spot - on handwriting analysis surprises			1
