-- it was only fleeting and came amid a @entity3 extravaganza of pop performances , dancing teacakes and a giant replica sea monster , but there was no mistaking its message			0
during the opening ceremony of the 20th @entity12 in @entity13 , actor and singer @entity10 planted a kiss on a male dancer , before dragging him to the altar for a mock wedding			1
it was a move intended to remind millions of viewers that homosexuality remains a crime in 42 of the 53 @entity12 member countries			2
the kiss won broad support on @entity26 , though @entity10 retweeted negative comments with the retort : " i am retwtin the neg because i want u all to see how bitter and @entity32 and @entity33 some people r : ) i am so happy right now			0
jb " @entity34 made a less controversial appearance , declaring the competition open ahead of 11 days of sport , headlined by a cameo appearance by the fastest man on the planet @entity41			1
@entity43 's monarch read out a message that had been kept hidden inside the @entity34 's baton during its parade and relay around 70 nations and territories in the last nine months			1
" to you , the @entity12 athletes , i send my good wishes for success in your endeavors , " @entity34 told the athletes			2
there was also a minute 's silence , led by @entity3 first minister @entity58 , for the 298 people who died in the @entity61 flight disaster , 82 of whom were from @entity12 nations			1
the @entity65 team also carried its flag at half mast on entering the @entity69 stadium where the ceremony took place			0
a capacity crowd of 40,000 were treated to a festival of dance and music with a strong thread of @entity3 culture and heritage			0
world famous @entity3 singers @entity79 and @entity81 also performed live , while former @entity83 manager @entity82 and @entity85 cricket legend @entity84 made appearances on video clips to highlight a @entity89 fund raising initiative promoted by the @entity12			2
biggest cheer of the night was reserved for the 310 - strong team representing the hosts , the last of the 71 to be paraded , with judo player @entity93 carrying its flag			2
six - time olympic gold medalist @entity41 was not at the opening ceremony but has been picked for @entity96 's all - conquering 4x100m relay squad			1
@entity41 is slated to step out at the 40,000 - seater @entity99 stadium on friday week for the heats of that competition , likely minutes after @entity97 runs in the 10,000m final			1
the pair 's antics on the final day of track and field competition at the @entity107 , where @entity41 emulated @entity109 's famous " @entity110 " celebration are still etched in the memory and @entity12 organizers will be hoping for a similar iconic moment			1
the warm glow of home success in the @entity116 , personified by double gold medalist @entity109 , has left the @entity43 public still hungry for multi-sports competition and ticket sales for the @entity12 have been strong			2
it means there will be no repeat of the half - empty stadiums which blighted the previous @entity12 in @entity124 in 2010 and left organizers facing criticism over the damage to @entity85 's reputation and the cost			1
the @entity43 royal family have been closely identified with the @entity12 since its inception in 1930 , originally titled the @entity12 for nations and territories ruled and administered by the @entity43			1
in recognition of decolonization , by the 1970 edition in @entity136 , @entity3 's other major city , the title of the event had been changed to the @entity12 and by 1978 in @entity139 , just the @entity12			1
@entity3 has hosted the @entity12 three times , @entity136 in 1970 and 1986 and now @entity13 , who fought off competition from @entity143 in @entity144 to be awarded the right			1
over 4,500 athletes will take part in 17 sports , in terms of countries and territories participating , 71 , the second biggest event of its kind after the @entity154			1
unlike the @entity154 , @entity43 athletes compete for their home nations of @entity157 , @entity3 , @entity158 and @entity159 , while there are also teams from the small islands of @entity163 , @entity164 and the @entity165			0
cyclist @entity166 , who is one of a number of big stars to suffer injury blows ahead of the @entity12 , was due to compete for the @entity165 , a @entity43 crown dependency in the @entity172 sea			2
@entity166 's withdrawal after his crash in the @entity175 was a blow to organizers , but compensated for by the decision of 2012 @entity175 winner @entity179 to ride for @entity157 in the track cycling event			0
aside from @entity41 and @entity109 , the highlight of the track and field competition will be the appearance of @entity185 's @entity184 , who smashed the world record in the 800m in taking gold at the @entity107 , but has been troubled by injury since his triumph			1
some of the most intense competition will be in the swimming pool where traditional power @entity193 is expected to dominate -- with @entity195 leading the way			0
@entity197 won gold at the @entity107 and 21 medals for her country in major championships over the past four years , including five golds at the @entity204			0
@entity3 hopes rest with @entity206 , who is heavy favorite for the 200m breast stroke , while the hosts could earn early success in the track cycling with 20 - year - old @entity212			0
she will attempt to compensate for the absence of six - time olympic gold medalist @entity215 , who announced his retirement last year having originally intended to end his career at his home @entity12			1
in his honor , the velodrome in @entity13 is named after @entity3 's favorite sporting son and the action there will start thursday with @entity225 in the team pursuit			0
competition , particularly between " old foes " @entity193 , the leading medal winners in the history of the @entity12 , and @entity157 , is set to be particularly fierce			0
but , by tradition , they have been called the " @entity236 " -- with competitors enjoying the more informal settings compared with the hot house atmosphere of an @entity154			0
the closing ceremony will take place at @entity99 where the baton will be handed over to @entity240 in @entity193 , which is hosting the @entity241			0
there is a political dimension , with the @entity12 take place against the backdrop of a referendum in september where voters in @entity3 will be given the chance to gain independence from the rest of the @entity43			2
@entity58 's @entity251 has been campaigning strongly for a " yes " vote , but he has promised not to link potential home success as an argument for separation			0
" i 've taken a kind of self - denying ordinance to concentrate on the @entity12 over the next 10 days and i think that 's what the people of @entity3 want , " he was quoted wednesday			2
whether politicians on both sides of the argument stick to their pledges is open to question , but what is n't in doubt is the enthusiasm of the @entity268 residents for the @entity12 , which will highlight their regenerated city to an estimated television audience of 1.5 billion people .			0
