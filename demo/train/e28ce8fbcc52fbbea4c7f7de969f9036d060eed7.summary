that 's the verdict from scientists trying to answer a question that has riveted people around the @entity4 and beyond for nearly a decade : did someone kill @entity7 leader @entity6 by poisoning him with a radioactive isotope ? his widow insists he was assassinated , a conclusion scientists who have completed an exhaustive study of the evidence did not reject , but said thursday they could not confirm either			1
" was polonium the cause of death ? " asked professor @entity13 , director of @entity15 's @entity14 about @entity6 's death in 2004 in a @entity18 military hospital			1
" our study has not been able to prove categorically a hypothesis of poisoning or another of non-poisoning by polonium			2
" he was fielding questions from reporters in @entity15 , @entity29 , about his group 's work a day after @entity32 released a report prepared by his laboratory that concluded that levels of polonium - 210 measured in @entity6 's personal effects and in tissues from his exhumed body " moderately " support a proposition that he died of polonium poisoning			1
@entity13 said thursday that the results " support reasonably the hypothesis of poisoning " by polonium , but he bemoaned the lack of tissue samples from just after death , which the hospital has destroyed			2
" if we had access to samples , we could be more categorical			0
" still , " poisoning from polonium - 210 was possible , " @entity13 said			1
the findings , released by the @entity53 of @entity54 of @entity15 , do not address how @entity6 , who died at age 75 , might have been poisoned or who might have done it			1
@entity13 also cited the passage of nine years since @entity6 died as a complicating factor			2
the half - life of polonium is 138 days , which means less than a millionth of the isotope that was present at death would still be there			1
a polonium expert who was not involved in the work praised the @entity29 researchers ' efforts as scientifically sound , but said they were given a tough job			2
" it 's like a blindfolded man holding the tail of an elephant and using that to estimate the weight of the elephant , " said @entity70 , a professor of radionuclide metrology in the physics department at the @entity73 in @entity74 , @entity75			0
" you can do it , but there is a huge amount of extrapolation involved			0
" and the mere presence of the isotope -- even in amounts significantly higher than what occurs naturally -- does not necessarily mean that that is what killed @entity6 , he told @entity94 in a telephone interview , citing the scientists ' measurement of a urine stain on @entity6 's underwear			2
" if you were being cynical about such a thing , if you wanted to put a false trail out there , you could put a tiny amount of polonium - 210 on that urine stain			1
that does n't mean that the urine stain came from inside him			0
" @entity70 described the amount of polonium needed to kill a man as " terrifyingly small ... the size of a grain of salt , something like that			2
" professor @entity114 , director of the forensics center at @entity15 , underscored the uncertainty			0
" we have never said in a categorical way we have the absolute proof that we 're dealing with polonium poisoning , " he said			2
but that caution was not shared by @entity6 's widow			0
" i 'm convinced it was a political murder , a political assassination , " @entity123 told @entity94 in a telephone interview from @entity125 , the capital of @entity126			1
" they wanted to get rid of him , " she said , without saying who " they " are			0
" i 'm not pointing fingers , but this polonium came from a nuclear reactor , and the next step is to identify its source			1
" it was her suspicions that led authorities to exhume @entity6 's body after polonium - 210 was found last year on his personal belongings			1
yet another complication : the chain of custody of @entity6 's personal effects -- from the time he died to 2012 , when the center began to study them -- is unclear			0
but the report said that @entity123 had " certified that the measured personal effects have been stored in a secured room			1
" invoices for the two analyses , whose cost @entity114 would not disclose , were sent to the @entity156 and to @entity123			1
@entity156 president @entity158 has ordered that a probe into his predecessor 's death continue " to reveal the complete truth to the @entity7 people and the entire world , " presidential spokesman @entity157 told @entity165 , the official @entity7 news agency , on thursday			1
what polonium does to the body the report may renew suspicions over how @entity6 -- the most prominent face of @entity7 opposition to @entity172 for five decades -- died			1
the @entity156 , which runs the @entity174 , has said @entity172 would have been behind any poisoning of @entity6 , who was regarded by many @entity7 as a father figure			2
" i believe that all fingers are pointed at the @entity172 occupation ... who have experience in such cases of poisoning , " said @entity177 , a member of the executive committee of the @entity179			0
@entity177 called for a " criminal international committee " to be formed to look into the report			0
an @entity172 @entity189 spokesman said wednesday that any such accusation would be " utter nonsense			0
" " this is nothing to do with us , and for the moment they refrained ( from ) making accusations , " @entity172 @entity189 spokesman @entity192 said			0
" they know why -- there 's no strictly no connection to @entity172			0
" @entity203 prosecutors launch murder inquiry in @entity6 's death @entity6 , who first led the @entity179 and then the @entity156 , died in november 2004 after suffering a stroke , ending weeks of illness			1
@entity7 officials said in the days before his death that @entity6 had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems			2
rumors of poisoning circulated at the time , but the @entity156 's then - foreign minister , @entity215 , said he " totally " ruled them out			0
@entity203 authorities , responding to a request from @entity6 's widow , opened a murder inquiry last year after the isotope was found on @entity6 's toothbrush , clothing and his keffiyeh , the black - and - white headscarf he often wore			1
@entity203 opened the investigation partly because @entity6 died there			0
forensic experts from @entity29 and @entity228 took their own samples for independent analysis			0
radiation poisoning caused by polonium - 210 looks like the end stage of cancer , according to medical experts			1
the substance can enter the body via a wound or through contaminated food , drink or even air			0
@entity228 spy dies after polonium poisoning			0

" i 'm convinced it was a political murder , " says @entity123
the @entity7 leader died in 2004 at age 75
last year , his widow , *suspecting* he was poisoned , had the body exhumed for tests
polonium - 210 , a radioactive isotope , had been detected on his clothing and toothbrush
