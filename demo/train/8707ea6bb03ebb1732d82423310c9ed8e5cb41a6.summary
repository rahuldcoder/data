-- @entity2 's revenue has been growing -- slowly , but growing			1
profits have been growing faster than revenue , as the company clamps down on expenses			2
the company 's core business software like @entity9 has been showing great results for more than a year now , and the @entity11 had its best holiday season ever , as @entity2 sold a million in a single day after @entity12			1
plus , it 's got more than $ 50 billion in cash			0
so why has the company 's stock stubbornly refused to move for the last decade ? why do big investors keep calling for ceo @entity19 's head ? the problem comes down to a simple statistic that should scare the heck out of @entity2 and its investors : five years ago , 95 % of devices connected to the @entity25 were @entity26 right now , less than 80 % are , and some folks expect the number to drop below 20 % in a few years			1
that 's a historic shift , and is just one of many signals that the personal computer is no longer dominant in the ever - shifting world of consumer technology			1
credit the explosion in smartphones , led by @entity38 's @entity37 and a bunch of other phones running @entity41 ( which is more popular than the iphone by sheer numbers )			0
@entity38 's @entity44 has also made a big dent , taking up the equivalent to about 10 % of the pc market -- and it 's less than 2 years old			0
@entity2 is nowhere in the worlds of smartphones or tablets			1
but this year , the company hopes to change all that			1
next month , the company will let the masses download and test a not - quite - finished version of @entity57 , which @entity19 has called the most important product in company history			1
@entity57 is going to be a little bit all over the place			1
on the surface , it will have a cool , modern look and feel that 's meant to be used with touchscreen tablets			0
call it an @entity44 killer if you will			0
it 's cutting edge and friendly , filled with bright , colorful squares and sliding screens , and it 's going to have a lot of features that will be familiar to @entity37 and @entity44 users , like an app store			0
if you buy a @entity81 tablet , that 's probably what you 're going to see and use most of the time			0
but @entity57 will also run on regular old pcs , and underneath the new tablet - friendly interface , it will look and feel a lot like the old version of @entity81			1
if you 're using a desktop pc or laptop pc at work , you 'll probably end up using the old interface			0
it 's a tricky balancing act to pull off , and lots could go wrong -- for instance , it 's not exactly clear how smooth it will be to switch between the two types of @entity81 , or if you 'll even be able to get the old @entity81 on certain types of tablets ( that is , tablets that run the power - efficient @entity102 processors used by the @entity44 and most other tablets today )			1
but if past @entity81 launches are any guide , @entity2 will help its cause by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on high - profile tv ads , viral whisper campaigns and " co-marketing " money for its pc hardware partners and the resellers who push @entity2 software to big corporations			1
but @entity57 is only half the equation			2
@entity2 came out with a surprisingly good smartphone platform way back in fall 2010 -- in some ways , it was better than the @entity37 from the moment it launched			2
but for a variety of reasons -- including mediocre phones that run the operating system , lack of support from big carriers like @entity128 and some big gaps with features and apps -- it flopped			0
a year later , @entity2 's @entity133 platform is still at less than 2 % market share , way behind @entity38 , @entity41 and even the struggling @entity135			2
but this year , @entity2 has teamed up with @entity136 , the biggest cell phone maker in the world , to push a new line of @entity133			1
its flagship phone , the @entity141 900 , has received universally great reviews -- almost like the kinds of reviews the @entity37 got when it came out			0
equally important , @entity2 has committed hundreds of millions of dollars to marketing these new phones , including paying commissions to staffers at retail stores			2
that 's critically important , as a lot of retail store clerks did n't even know what a @entity133 was last year			0
expect @entity2 to push those products like its future depends on them			2
