-- the shaka sign -- a person 's thumb and pinkie extended , the rest of the fingers in a fist -- is uniquely @entity8 , a way to say " right on , " " hang loose " or simply hello			1
but it turns out it 's not the only way islanders have used their hands to communicate			0
a research group at the @entity15 at @entity16 announced friday that they had documented -- for the first time -- @entity18 , or @entity19 , which deaf people across the islands ' diverse ethnic groups have used for decades if not longer			1
while there is written evidence dating back to 1821 indicating such a language existed , beginning in the 1940s it started to get largely phased out in favor of @entity28			1
quiz : how good is your sign language ? researchers identified about 40 @entity33 who still use it -- interviewing 19 of them , plus two adult children , on four islands for their study			1
but they are all 80 years of age or older , making it imperative to act now in order to preserve it before it 's too late			0
" researchers are committed to a long term study of @entity19 with the goals of producing ... a dictionary ( and ) archived videotaped data , " said @entity43 , an @entity45 professor of linguistics at the @entity15 at @entity46			2
" it is also hoped that an effort can be made to revitalize @entity19 , so that it can be taught in high schools and universities in @entity56			0
" hearing - impaired people have found ways to communicate for generations , all across the world			0
that might mean tapping into a well - established language , like asl or @entity63 , or finding some other way to get a point across			0
comic uses sign language " if they do n't have access to learning a sign language that 's already in existence , then a community of deaf people will find a way to communicate , " said @entity68 , a professor emeritus at the @entity69			1
" over time , they will find a way to stabilize and have a structure that becomes an actual language			0
" that 's what the @entity56 university researchers say happened -- even if few realized that a distinctive sign language existed for decades on the island until now			1
while the now - prevailing @entity28 has rubbed off some , @entity43 said it 's been relatively minimal among those practicing @entity18			2
specifically , at least 80 % of its signs are distinct , while the rest come from @entity28 -- which he said is enough to characterize it as its own language , rather than a dialect			1
for example , the @entity18 word for father is to wag your finger -- whereas in @entity28 , it 's an open hand with fingers spread and a thumb to the forehead			2
want to say that someone is telling a lie ? then put an index finger in the middle of your throat			0
the grammar structure in @entity18 also differentiates it from @entity28 , @entity43 noted			2
" sign languages ... evolve in a community of users , and are not signed versions of spoken languages , " the university said in a press release			0
" the full history of @entity19 is yet to be told			0
" @entity120 sign language star surprised by fame			1

records dating to the 1800s pointing to a sign language on the @entity8 islands
but the unique language has n't been documented until now , by university researchers
a professor says at least 80 % of its signs are distinct from @entity28
