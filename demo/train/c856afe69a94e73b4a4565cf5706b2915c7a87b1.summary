-- in her debut film , " @entity9 , " @entity1 won plaudits for her portrayal of a girl from the slums groomed for a life of prostitution			1
off screen the @entity11 actress is now lending her voice to save other girls from that very same fate			2
@entity1 , 28 , is an ambassador for @entity16 's because i am a girl campaign , a narrator on the ground - breaking documentary film @entity20 , which debuted on @entity0 , and shared a stage with @entity23 secretary general @entity22 at the launch of the @entity26 's campaign to empower girls and women around the world			1
the focus of all these campaigns is making sure girls receive an education , no matter where they live or what their background			1
@entity1 's passion for education stems from her mother and grandmother , who were both teachers in @entity42			1
" my mum still follows her dreams , " she told @entity0			0
" she just retired as a schoolteacher , but she always had a dream of continuing teaching children , but this time more underprivileged children			0
and she 's living out her dream			2
" she added : " my grandma was also a teacher , so i guess education , and the importance of education and how it really shapes and transforms lives , was something that was engrained in my system from the very beginning			0
" @entity1 , raised in a middle class family in @entity62 , broke into acting at the age of 22 when director @entity64 picked her for the role of @entity66 in the film " @entity9 " , released in 2008			1
the film won best film in the @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			1
@entity1 was nominated for a @entity72 as best supporting actress			1
she now lives in @entity74 with her @entity9 co-star @entity75 , and has since starred in films including @entity77 's " you will meet a tall dark stranger , " " @entity80 , " alongside @entity81 in " @entity82 " and @entity84 's " @entity83 , " an interpretation of @entity86 , set in modern - day @entity42			1
originally from @entity62 , some have criticized @entity1 for neglecting @entity89 , but she argues that her two films set in @entity42 portray her native country as well as any			2
" they are just hardcore @entity42 stories and there 's no denying it , " she said			0
" it 's kind of silly to just make this whole @entity11 / @entity89 such a big debate when actually it should be about the stories that are coming from that part of the world			0
" my two @entity42 films for many do n't count as @entity89 , which is fine			0
but at least they 're @entity42 international films and i 'm proud of that			0
" @entity1 has criticized the " male - dominated " world of film , calling for more female writers and directors to help bring more strong female characters for women of all ages			1
" the only way to cure that problem is to have more female writers and more female directors , " she said			1
" there will be a different perspective when you have women writers and women directors			2
there is sometimes a misconception that a female director ca n't really tackle manly issues and definitely @entity125 proves them wrong			0
" so would she get behind the camera herself ? " i believe that i 'm on my way to becoming a producer because there are so many stories that i read that i 'm so inspired by , " says @entity1			2
" i do n't necessarily see myself in them as an actor , but i 'd like them to see the light of day			0
so if i can help in producing that project , in collaborating with someone else , that 's another way for me to feel that in my so called male - dominated industry there is still a female voice			1
" @entity1 closed her @entity142 account in 2009 after receiving " unpleasant intrusions " , but has just launched a new page , posting on education and social justice alongside photos from her travels			2
" i begin a new journey with this @entity142 page , " she wrote in her opening post			0
" i feel like there has been a shift in consciousness in the last couple of years where all of us have become more curious to know what is happening in the world today			0
" @entity1 's next film , " @entity159 , " due out later this year , tells the true story of an @entity162 dancer who risked his life for his dream after dancing was banned in the country			1
after that , she 's not short on ambitions , reeling off a list from @entity171 director @entity170 to @entity172 , best known for " @entity173 " , that she 'd love to work with			0
" there are so many , i 'm glad i 'm just 28 with hopefully a long career ahead of me and i can keep knocking them off one - by - one , off my list			0
