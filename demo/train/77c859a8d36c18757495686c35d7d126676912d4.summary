@entity1 's children are taking their fight against their stepmom to see their ailing father all the way to court			1
@entity1 's daughter @entity7 and her husband filed a conservatorship petition in a @entity11 court monday , claiming the retired radio host " has been isolated from his daughters , friends and other family " by his wife			1
@entity1 , who for decades hosted radio music countdown shows " @entity21 " and " @entity22 , " is suffering from parkinson 's disease and " may have early onset @entity26 's dementia , " according to the court filing			1
@entity1 , 81 , has the " ability to shuffle short distances , but is mainly bedridden and requires the assistance of a wheelchair to move any distance , " the court document said			2
the petition claims that daughter @entity7 and her husband , dr. @entity34 , have been unable to check on @entity1 's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions			1
they " have been prevented from exercising their duties " by @entity47 , who has been married to the retired radio host for three decades , the filing contends			1
" there is no communication between @entity47 and us and his daughters , " brother @entity48 told @entity49 saturday			2
" we have no knowledge of how he is , what he 's doing , if he 's better , if he 's worse , and we 're scared that we 'll never see him again			1
" the petition claims @entity1 's wife has refused to provide the children with the name of their father 's primary care physician			1
that doctor would be consulted to determine @entity1 's " ability to act on his own behalf , " which is the question that would cause the health care power of attorney to take effect , it said			1
a hearing date is set for november 19			0
daughter @entity71 told @entity49 that her stepmother suddenly barred her sister , her uncle and some of @entity1 's friends from seeing him about three months ago			1
she 's perplexed by the decision			0
" i do n't get it , i do n't understand it , " @entity71 , who co-hosts the radio show " @entity78 " with @entity80 's @entity79 , told @entity49			1
" he has @entity26 's , and all the research we 've done indicates socialization would help him			1
" @entity49 has reached out to get a statement from @entity47 , but has been unsuccessful			2
@entity71 and other members of the family held a protest at @entity1 's @entity90 house to raise public attention to their dispute last week			1
the fight is not about an inheritance , @entity71 said			0
" my dad told us a long time ago we were not in the will , and we 're ok with that			0
we 've known that for years , " she said			0
" i 've never asked him for anything , nor have i asked @entity47 for anything			0
" @entity103 , @entity1 's agent of more than 35 years , said he did not want to take sides in the argument , but he did say @entity1 is still of sound mind			2
" he has @entity26 's , has it very bad			2
it took his speech , and for somebody who made millions of dollars using his voice -- for him to lose that gift , that beautiful instrument -- it must be frustrating			0
but he 's handling it very well , " @entity103 said			0
" his mind is very sharp , his brain works well			0
you can tell in his eyes he understands everything you 're saying			0
he just has trouble translating it from the brain to his vocal cords			0
" besides the famed countdown shows , @entity1 was also the voice of @entity125 in the cartoon " @entity127 " and an announcer for @entity129			2
he was a popular dj and occasional actor before " @entity21 " began in 1970			0
