-- chants of " shame on you " rained down from a packed @entity5 gallery thursday as the state 's lame - duck @entity7 legislature advanced legislation giving workers the right to opt out of union membership			1
labor unions and @entity16 in the state legislature , some of whom walked out on the vote , lambasted the rush move as a stealthy subversion of the public will in labor - heavy @entity5			1
" republicans who got defeated up and down the ballot are using this lame - duck legislature to try and jam through legislation that flies in the face of what the voters wanted , " said @entity22 , the spokesman for the state 's @entity23			1
" it 's a disgusting process and a disgusting result			0
" @entity5 's house passed two bills and the state @entity5 approved one that would make @entity5 a " right to work " state in which public and private workers could opt out of union membership and dues			1
the bills must be now voted on by the opposite chamber before going to gov. @entity45 , who supports the change			2
twenty - three @entity48 states have similar legislation , according to the @entity50			1
@entity7 supporters , including gov. @entity52 , said the proposal would improve the state 's economic competitiveness			1
" under freedom to work , @entity56 will have the freedom to choose whether or not to join a union , " @entity52 said			1
" they wo n't be forced to pay union dues if they do n't want to , and they wo n't lose their jobs because of it			2
and if they want to pay dues voluntarily , they have the freedom to do that , too			2
" @entity71 announced the surprise plan to reporters thursday morning			0
within hours , thousands of labor supporters descended on the capitol building in @entity76 to protest , but were met by police who used pepper spray to keep some of them out of secure areas			0
authorities arrested eight people and locked down the building , preventing thousands of protesters from getting in and drawing the ire of @entity16 sen. @entity87			0
" they 're just ramming it through with no public involvement , " he said			0
" they locked the state @entity93 down			0
every way they could , they shut the people out of the process			0
" police said they were not trying to limit protest rights but were fearful of a repeat of events last year in @entity104 , where demonstrators occupied the statehouse to protest @entity108 gov. @entity108 's efforts to strip union rights from most state jobs			2
" people have a right to protest but it will be done in an orderly manner , " state police inspector @entity111 told @entity0 affiliate @entity112			0
the building was locked down because its capacity had been exceeded , he said			0
enough people had gotten in to fill the gallery			0
@entity87 complained that @entity7 used a legislative maneuver -- placing the provisions in an appropriations bill -- to prevent voters from having the opportunity to overturn the decision			0
" if you dedicate funds to legislation , it ca n't be overturned by the public , " he said			2
lawmakers also skipped committee hearings that normally precede the final passage of legislation , @entity22 said			1
" that 's a complete subversion of how the legislative process is supposed to work , " he said			2
" they 've just completely thrown that out the window			0
" @entity22 said it 's likely @entity16 would challenge the validity of the legislation in court if it wins final approval			1
state law requires the @entity145 to wait five days before considering the bill			0
@entity5 , with its ties to the auto industry , has long been a stronghold for the labor movement ; 671,000 residents of the state are union members			1
but the state has suffered economically in recent years and @entity45 said employers need the flexibility to compete with businesses in neighboring @entity158 and other states with right - to - work laws			1
the proposal would not affect collective bargaining rights , except to eliminate the ability of unions to have companies fire workers who refuse to pay union dues , said @entity168 , director of labor policy for the free - market @entity5 think thank , the @entity170			1
@entity45 , in a blog entry on his website , said he thinks @entity7 were n't trying to destroy unions			0
" we owe much to the labor movement -- the end of child labor , the 40 - hour work week , safe working conditions in factories , and a guaranteed minimum wage , " he said			2
" the labor movement is an important part of @entity5 's fabric , and nothing about this proposal eliminates it			2
" but @entity189 @entity188 president @entity187 said the bill does n't help workers at all			1
" in the wake of this legislation , the only ' freedom ' gained for @entity5 workers will be the freedom to make less , the freedom to be disrespected at work , the freedom to struggle to pay their bills and the freedom to be left out of the @entity203 , " she said			1
@entity0 's @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report			0

@entity212 : " nobody should be surprised if there are some legal challenges , " @entity22 says
gov. @entity52 says the legislation would make @entity5 more competitive
the @entity188 says workers in right - to - work states get less pay and fewer benefits
the vote takes place to a chorus of " shame on you ! "
