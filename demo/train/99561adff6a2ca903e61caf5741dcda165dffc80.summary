-- @entity2 's @entity1 were held to a disappointing goalless draw by @entity4 in their @entity6 clash in @entity7 on friday night			1
following the earlier 2 - 2 draw between @entity10 and the @entity11 , it means all four teams can still qualify for the last 16 knockout stage			1
@entity1 will play group leaders @entity10 and the @entity11 take on @entity4 , whose confidence will be boosted after keeping @entity2 's men at bay			1
the @entity18 showed his ruthless streak by dropping goalkeeper @entity21 , after his blunder cost @entity1 dear in a 1 - 1 draw with the @entity11 in their group opener			1
his replacement @entity28 was scarcely called into action after an early mis - punch which seemed to sum up a nervy @entity1 display			1
@entity33 midfielder @entity32 had their best chance in the first half but saw his effort from 10 meters out well saved by @entity38 , who had an excellent game in the @entity4 goal			1
with @entity1 's talisman @entity42 again kept in check , they were only a shadow of the team which breezed through qualifying and entered the tournament as one of the favorites			2
@entity2 , who surely could have found better ways to celebrate his 64th birthday , was perplexed by his team 's display			2
" this is not the team i recognize from training or from qualifying , " he told @entity54			2
" we missed too many passes , lost too many balls			0
it was not a good game			0
we have to do better			0
" we have another game to play			0
it 's our last chance to continue in the tournament			0
the players know what they have to do			0
" earlier , the @entity11 came back from two goals behind to draw 2 - 2 with @entity10 in a pulsating encounter in @entity70			1
first half goals from midfielder @entity72 and striker @entity73 looked to be enough to guarantee @entity10 would reach the last 16 , but it proved only the signal for a courageous fight back by the @entity11 @entity78 star @entity77 pulled the first goal back in the 48th minute as he smashed his shot into the roof of the net with ferocious power			1
the equalizer came with nine minutes remaining as @entity85 headed down for @entity86 -- son of coach @entity87 -- to convert with an equally emphatic strike			0
the @entity11 looked to have scored the winner when @entity90 prodded home a @entity77 free kick from the right , but referee @entity94 had already blown for a foul to the dismay of the @entity97			2
" i am assuming it was a foul , it could n't have been an offside , we asked the referee many times , but he could n't explain it , " man of the match @entity77 told @entity100 .			0

@entity1 held goalless draw @entity4 in @entity6 clash in @entity7
