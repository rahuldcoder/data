@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 will continue with its peaceful nuclear program and push to reengage with the world and build its economy , president @entity3 said thursday in a speech at the @entity9			1
@entity3 , who became president in august , said his country would " under no conditions give up its right to pursue peaceful technology			1
" but , he said , the six - month nuclear deal between @entity4 and six world powers , which limits the country 's nuclear program in exchange for lighter sanctions , opens the door to greater @entity4 engagement with the world			1
" what we have achieved is not merely a temporary agreement but a prelude to future agreement and engagement , " @entity3 said			0
in thursday 's speech , he said he would push for improved ties with the world as part of his drive to make the @entity4 economy one of the top 10 within the next three decades			2
@entity4 's economy ranked 22nd in the world in 2012 , based on gross domestic product , according to the @entity39			0
" i view @entity4 's economy as the most congruent , capable and closest to that of successful emerging economies , and i see @entity4 's place alongside them in the future , " @entity3 said			1
he said the country intended to reopen trade and industrial and economic relations with its neighbors -- but that does n't appear to include @entity51			0
responding to a question from @entity9 founder @entity53 on whether @entity4 's approach included all countries , @entity3 said : " all countries that @entity4 has officially recognized are inside the circle			1
" " @entity59 -- there are no exceptions , " he said			0
since the @entity4 revolution of 1979 , @entity4 has viewed @entity51 as an illegitimate state with no right to exist			2
@entity51 prime minister @entity64 said @entity3 's remarks were the latest in an " @entity4 show of deception			1
" he said the goal of the @entity4 ayatollahs ' regime was to ease sanctions without conceding on their program to produce nuclear weapons			1
" they say they oppose nuclear weapons ; why do they insist on maintaining the ballistic missiles and plutonium and the advanced centrifuges that are only used for the production of nuclear weapons ? " @entity64 said			2
" so it sounds good , i wish it was real , it is n't real			0
i think the world has a mission to prevent @entity4 from getting nuclear weapons			1
" earlier , @entity4 foreign minister @entity91 , in an exclusive interview with @entity2 , said the @entity93 administration has mischaracterized concessions by his side in the six - month nuclear deal with @entity4 , saying " we did not agree to dismantle anything			0
" the accord requires @entity4 to dilute its stockpile of uranium that had been enriched to 20 % -- well above the 5 % level needed for power generation but still below the level for developing a nuclear weapon			0
in addition , the deal requires @entity4 to limit new enrichment to 5 % and dismantle equipment necessary for higher levels , according to the @entity110			0
@entity3 also said @entity114 , where a civil war has been raging for almost three years , has been " engulfed in a major catastrophe , and the people have borne the brunt			2
it is a miserable situation and a very sad situation			0
" he said @entity4 " believes that everyone , all of us , should try our best to put a stop to the bloodshed in @entity114 , and later push terrorists out of @entity114			2
" @entity3 said the next step would be to " pave the way for the opposition to sit around a table with the @entity114 government " and for free and fair elections to be held			1
democracy : @entity131 's beautiful dream in the wrong hands opinion : will global elite listen to @entity134 of poor ? can @entity0 make a difference to global inequality ? opinion : @entity139 's leaders have failed the @entity141 official on nuke deal : ' we did not agree to dismantle anything '			0
