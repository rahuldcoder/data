-- the @entity1 began their 50th anniversary tour with the biggest possible bang on sunday night , as a host of special guests joined them for a hit - packed show in @entity8 's @entity7			1
former @entity1 comrades @entity9 and @entity11 returned to the ranks , while @entity13 and @entity14 were also on hand to help with the celebrations			1
@entity9 -- who left the @entity1 in 1992 -- was greeted with warm applause and a handshake from @entity19 as he returned to play bass on " @entity21 " and " @entity22			1
" but the biggest cheers came for @entity11 , who has n't been a @entity24 since 1974 -- he played trademark blues guitar solos on an extended version of " @entity28 " and looked like he was enjoying every second of the reunion			1
rare and @entity31 @entity13 brought a gospel feel to " @entity33 , " trading vocal acrobatics with @entity35 , and @entity14 did a flashy guitar turn on 1969 's " i 'm going down			1
" but , despite the headline - grabbing special guests , the evening remained very much about the @entity1 ' core members and their remarkable career , with the set spanning from their second - ever single , 1963 's " @entity37 " to their latest , 2012 's " @entity45			2
" in fact , it ended up pretty much like anyone else 's 50th birthday party : there were some old friends , some laughs , some tears , plenty of memories and a lot of embarrassing dancing -- plus it was all over in time for everyone to get the last train home			2
that said , the evening began half an hour later than billed , at 8.30 p.m. , with a video in which stars from @entity64 to @entity65 and @entity66 to @entity67 revealed how their first time hearing the @entity1 impacted them			1
then a host of drummers wearing gorilla masks -- a nod to the cover of their new hits compilation , @entity77 -- paraded around the arena before " @entity37 " kicked things off			2
simian percussionists and the massive , lips - shaped stage set aside , this was a relatively gimmick - free stones set , both in terms of stage production and musical feel			2
this was the @entity1 in the raw -- or , at least , as raw as they can be after 50 years together and when playing in front of 20,000 fans			0
so hits like " @entity94 , " " it 's @entity93 " and " @entity95 , " plus a raucous " @entity98 " were rattled through with minimum ceremony , at maximum volume			0
a @entity1 album guide @entity35 , however , was in vintage showman form			1
in between pumping up the crowd with regular forays down a runway that ran around a central " lips " pit full of hardcore fans , he brought plenty of funnies , at one point even joking about the controversy over the cost of tickets for the show , which started at Â £ 90 ( some were re-sold for thousands of pounds online )			0
" everybody alright in the cheap seats ? " @entity35 asked			1
" they are n't so cheap though , are they ? that 's the trouble			2
" " what a year it 's been for @entity123 celebrations , " @entity35 quipped later			1
" there was the @entity125			0
we did n't do that			0
we did n't do that			0
and we did n't do the song for that either ! but i 'm so glad that we 're here and that you 're here			0
" @entity140 -- while seemingly content to let @entity137 do some of the heavy lifting on guitar -- was in similarly jocular form			0
" it 's good to see you all , " @entity140 grinned as he took the mic for a two - song stint , " @entity145 " and " happy , " adding , " it 's good to see anybody			0
" the other members also took their moment in the sun , @entity137 milking the applause to such an extent that @entity35 was moved to jokingly warn him that people " had to catch the last tube			1
" in contrast , drummer @entity157 only reluctantly stepped to the front of the stage to take his bow			0
the set closed with a peerless run of classics , including " @entity165 , " " @entity166 " and " @entity167 , " before @entity35 donned a feathery cloak for an epic " @entity170 " to close the main set			1
after a brief break they returned with not one , but two choirs for a stunning " @entity177 " before a final " @entity178 , " with @entity140 ' kinetic riffing center stage , ended the evening with a massive crowd singalong			2
@entity181 ' @entity180 ! @entity1 film from ' 65 released true , even after 50 years , the @entity1 still could n't get any " satisfaction " -- the 1965 hit was the most notable absentee from the set , despite appearing on the set list handed to the media			0
but as @entity35 left the stage , still jogging and shaking his maracas after two and a half hours and 23 songs , it was clear that even at these ticket prices , the @entity1 ' 50th anniversary shows deliver value for money			1
set list : " @entity37 " " @entity94 " " it 's @entity93 " " @entity95 " " @entity33 " " @entity199 " " @entity98 " " i 'm going down " " @entity201 " " one more shot " " @entity45 " " @entity21 " " @entity22 " " @entity145 " " happy " " @entity28 " " @entity203 " " @entity165 " " @entity166 " " @entity167 " " @entity170 " " @entity177 " " @entity178 " see original story at @entity0			0
