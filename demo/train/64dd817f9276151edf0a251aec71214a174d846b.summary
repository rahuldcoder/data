-- there 's a website that lies to restaurants , making reservations under fake names , and then sells them to you			1
if that rubs you the wrong way , you 're not alone			2
@entity11 , which launched last week , was hit with a backlash so nasty , it led its creator to call himself " the most hated person in @entity15			1
" and it 's just the latest on a list of recent startups that have some critics complaining that , in the go - go @entity22 startup culture , almost anything can attract interest , and big investor money , even if it seems to straddle the line between right and wrong or even reality and parody			1
" this is irresponsible and sleazy and exactly what people hate about startups sucking the life out of @entity15 , " @entity30 senior writer @entity29 wrote of @entity11 on @entity31			1
creator @entity36 says he wrote the app , which is @entity15 - only for now , after waiting 30 minutes for a burrito			1
" is this even legal ? is it ethical ? restaurants are going to hate this ! " @entity36 wrote in a blog post about the " overwhelmingly negative " response he 's gotten			0
" to be honest , i have n't spent a lot of time thinking through these questions			1
i built this site as an experiment in consumer demand for a particular product , and the jury 's still out on whether it will work			0
" complaints centered largely on two issues : making money off something that should be free and hurting restaurants by scooping up reservations that , if not purchased , could lead to empty tables and lost revenue			1
the going rate for a reservation on the site appears to be $ 12			1
after you pay , @entity11 tells you the fake name to use			1
@entity36 said that he 's been able to cancel reservations that are n't purchased several hours in advance and that " in the interest of ethics and fairness , " he wants to talk to restaurants about working with them directly			1
selling services that would otherwise be free has become something of a trend in the startup world			1
several new parking apps let users in crowded neighborhoods post when they 're about to leave a spot and charge someone for the opportunity to take it			1
@entity15 's city attorney has threatened to sue several of those startups , saying they break the law by selling what should be a public commodity			1
not all apps raising eyebrows in @entity22 are so controversial			1
some just shed light on the fact that almost any idea can draw investors with dreams of big payouts in what could be a new tech bubble ... or can at least have venture - capital - seeking creators firing off news releases in hopes of luring a shark			0
one , @entity103 , was n't long for this world			0
its concept : selling you money for more money			0
selling you quarters to do laundry , to be precise			0
for $ 27 , the startup would mail you $ 20 worth of quarters			1
@entity114 went under late last month , but not before raising the ire of some in the tech world			2
" probably smart , " @entity119 's @entity118 wrote of the closure , which apparently came when the startup had drawn fewer than 10 customers			2
" but at least they will be ' focusing ( their ) energy on something ultimately more worthwhile , ' which would be anything			0
lying down in the middle of the street and screaming would be ultimately more worthwhile than this			0
" then there 's @entity131			0
the messaging app does one thing and one thing only			0
it lets you send the two - letter greeting , " @entity131 ! " to a friend			0
no , that 's not a parody ( though it has inspired at least one			0
yo , @entity142 lets users similarly send a single word to friends , referencing the " @entity146 " character who speaks only his name )			2
that idea ? it raised $ 1.2 million from investors			2
and reportedly has more than 300,000 users			2
" let me stipulate that in the tech world anything with messaging is hot , " wrote the @entity154 's @entity153			0
" single - service apps are also hot			0
the surface of the sun is hot ... that 's where i would like to fling myself rather than take @entity131 seriously			0
" there 's no shortage of analysts speculating that this latest round of apps could be a sign that a tech bubble along the lines of the one that caused early @entity172 stars to crumble could be upon us			0
if nothing else , they predict , investors will soon sober up and put their cash into the @entity177 and @entity178 of the world rather than vaguely defined startups			2
which makes sense ; it 'll leave more money to buy their dinner reservations .			2

new startup made its creator " the most hated person in @entity15 "
@entity11 books restaurant reservations with fake names
users can pay $ 12 to get the reservation
website is one of several startups raising questions lately
