-- wearing a green t - shirt under a blue work shirt , i 'm about to depart for @entity4			1
at my farewell breakfast -- one last eggs - any - style -- my stylish , college - aged daughter says to me , " you look like a scrub			1
ok if you 're painting a house			1
" slim down your suitcase by doing laundry in your room every few days			1
scrub or not , my bag is light			1
as compartmentalized as a tv dinner , it includes a folding board with four shirts and an extra pair of pants ; bags for small garments , such as underwear and five pairs of socks ( wear for two days , wash every 10 days ) ; a tiny toiletries kit ; electronics ( @entity30 , cell phone , camera , laptop , flash drive , chargers , adapters , and batteries ) ; and that miscellaneous bag filled with security - blanket extras i probably wo n't need ( spot remover , sewing kit , extra glasses , and so on )			1
i also throw in a sweater , light jacket , and day bag			1
all my shoes are on my feet			1
even when traveling in winter , i pack just about as light			1
i wear heavier , warmer , high - top , waterproof shoes			1
i add a warm coat , long johns ( quick - drying capilene or super-light silk ) , scarf , gloves , hat , and an extra pair of socks and underwear since things dry more slowly			1
@entity63 layer my clothing for warmth , knowing i 'll be outside in the cold for hours at a time			1
do n't pack for the worst - case scenario			1
for a spring or fall trip , risk shivering for a day rather than taking a heavy coat ( or buy a sweater in @entity4 for a useful , fun souvenir to layer under your jacket )			1
whatever time of year you go , minimize the amount of clothing you pack , choose dark clothes that dry quickly , and plan to spend 10 minutes every few nights doing some wash			2
i bring my luggage onboard , by limiting my load to 20 pounds in a carry - on - size bag ( a soft 9 - by - 22 - by - 14 - inch bag will fit in the overhead bins and under most airplane seats )			2
with some airlines charging a fee to check even one suitcase , bringing just one carry - on bag can save you money and time			2
quick , last - minute changes in flight plans become simpler			2
when i land in @entity97 , i 'm on my way downtown while everyone else stares anxiously at the luggage carousel			2
when i fly home , i 'm the first guy the dog sniffs			2
if you 're traveling with only a carry - on , remember not to pack liquids ( unless in bottles of 3 ounces or less )			2
check www.tsa.gov/travelers for the latest on what you can or ca n't bring on the plane			2
packing light helps me be mobile in @entity4			1
i use a convertible backpack / suitcase with zip - away shoulder straps , giving me the best of both worlds -- a suitcase when in town and a backpack when i 'm on the move			2
i live out of this bag for three months each year -- and i absolutely love it			0
if you prefer to not have a bag on your back , consider a carry - on - sized suitcase with wheels ( this is what my wife and daughter travel with )			1
base your decision on the strength of your back			0
another advantage of packing light is that you 're unlikely to leave something behind in a hotel			0
packing up to check out of a room is a kind of ritual for me			0
putting on my socks , i wonder if i really need to wear them again , considering my laundry level like checking a battery or a gas tank			0
i spread out the cover of my bed so nothing gets lost in a big wrinkle , then corral stuff scattered around the room onto the bed before tucking everything into my bag			0
for a one - or two - night stop , i do n't use the closet or drawers , so they do n't need to be checked			0
i carefully survey the electrical outlets to be sure i did n't forget some recharging cord			0
most importantly , i physically feel my money belt to confirm that my passport -- the only item easy to feel without opening it -- is in there			0
a money belt is a small , nylon - zippered pouch that fastens around the waist under your pants or skirt			0
with a money belt , all of your ca n't - lose items ( such as your passport , railpass , credit / debit card , and cash ) are on you as securely and thoughtlessly as your underpants			0
ever thought about that with underpants ? you put them on in the morning , do n't think about them all day long , and every night they 're exactly where you put them			0
wearing a money belt , all my essentials are just as securely out of sight and out of mind			0
it 's luxurious peace of mind			0
remember , packing light is n't just about the flight ; it 's about your traveling lifestyle			0
with only one bag , you 'll feel lean and in control			0
after you enjoy that sweet mobility and freedom , you 'll never go any other way			0
