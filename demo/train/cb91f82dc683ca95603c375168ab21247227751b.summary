@entity0 -- last week @entity3 senators expressed dismay and outrage to learn that the uniforms for @entity3 olympians were produced in @entity8			1
but this is not new			0
for years unrestrained globalization has seen textile and clothing multinationals race to the bottom in the search for cheaper and cheaper production			0
the end of the @entity19 trade agreement saw the volume of textile imports to the @entity3 from @entity8 more than double from 2004 to 2011			1
the phasing out of quota arrangements has led to the loss of millions of textile and garment jobs in industrialized and developing countries alike			1
for example , in 1980 @entity29 had 4,055 textile and clothing manufacturers			0
now , @entity29 as a whole has only 690			0
as it is cheaper to manufacture in countries that do not enforce international labour standards or pay workers a living wage , textiles and apparel are most often sourced from low wage countries such as @entity8 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
developing countries need jobs for their growing populations , but they have to be good jobs , without exploitation by companies from the industrialized world			2
@entity51 : it 's too late to remake @entity55 uniforms for @entity56 like with @entity57 for the @entity51 , a $ 156 million deal with @entity59 makes the company a key sponsor of the @entity62			0
the company is providing sportswear for the @entity65 and @entity66 , and owns exclusive licensing rights for all sportswear sold at @entity62 venues and stores			0
like @entity57 , @entity59 is not manufacturing the majority of its products in the @entity73 , or even in @entity74 , but is sourcing its @entity65 apparel from a range of low wage countries including @entity8 , @entity78 , @entity42 , @entity79 , @entity80 , the @entity81 , @entity43 and @entity82			2
what 's really ' @entity84 ' a worldwide alliance of trade unions and ngos established the @entity88 in 2003 to demand that the @entity65 principles of fairness and respect are extended to workers producing @entity65 goods			0
in may this year the @entity88 campaign published a report on @entity65 supplier plants in @entity8 , the @entity81 and @entity82 that found the working conditions fell far short of the expectations of the @entity96 ( @entity96 )			2
far from being paid a wage sufficient to meet basic needs and provide some discretionary income -- a requirement for all @entity105 2012 suppliers -- workers were receiving poverty wages			2
half of the workers that spoke with the researchers in the @entity81 told us they rely on " pay day loans " to get through the month , despite working more than 60 hours a week during busy periods			0
in @entity82 workers earned as little as $ 79 per month , and estimated this was only about one quarter of a living wage			1
play fair demands that multinational companies do more than pay lip service to human rights : they need to pay prices that enable suppliers to pay a living wage , they need to make sure that factories have the capacity to meet deadlines without requiring exploitatively long working hours , and they need to go beyond audits and engage workers and their unions in efforts to truly understand what conditions in supplier factories are like			1
everyone wants to be proud of the @entity65 athletes representing their country and not squirm in their seats when thinking of how the clothing the teams are wearing was produced			0
it is not right that workers in @entity79 footwear factories produce dozens of trainers each day , yet it would cost their entire monthly wage of $ 102 if they were to buy a single pair			0
from our readers : @entity3 olympians should go naked with labor costing as little as 50 cents in the manufacture of a $ 100 sports shoe in @entity8 or @entity43 , paying a living wage would have a negligible impact on retail price			1
as consumers we need to tell multinational companies and governments loud and clear that we are willing to pay the price for decent conditions of work			1
alternative view : why not make @entity65 uniforms in @entity8 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			1

senators outraged to learn that uniforms for @entity3 olympians made in @entity8
phasing out of quota arrangements has led to loss of millions of textile jobs in @entity3
@entity167 says textile companies must pay prices so suppliers can pay living wage
he says consumers must make clear they will pay price for decent conditions of work
