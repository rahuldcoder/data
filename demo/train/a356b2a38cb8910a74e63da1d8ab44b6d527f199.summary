almost two decades ago , a parlor game called " @entity1 of @entity1 " became an unlikely grass - roots phenomenon among movie buffs and foretold today 's social web of online connections			1
maybe the only one who was not amused by the game was @entity1 himself			1
" i was horrified by it			2
i thought it was a giant joke at my expense , " said the prolific actor saturday during a talk at the @entity14 festival here			1
" i appreciate it now			0
but i was very resistant to it ( at first )			0
" the game , which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year , requires players to link celebrities to @entity1 , in as few steps as possible , via the movies they have in common			1
the more odd or random the celebrity , the better			0
for example , @entity25 was in " @entity27 " with @entity28 , who was in " @entity30 " with @entity1			1
inspired by " six degrees of separation , " the theory that nobody is more than six relationships away from any other person in the world , the game was dreamed up in 1994 by @entity38 and two classmates at @entity40 in @entity41 , @entity42			0
they were watching " footloose " on tv when it was followed by another @entity1 movie , and then another			1
" it was just one of those lightbulb moments , " said @entity38 , who joined @entity1 onstage at @entity14			1
" it was like , ' this guy is everywhere ! he 's the center of the entertainment universe			0
' " after it spread among their friends , @entity38 and his co-creators , @entity58 and @entity59 , managed to get booked on @entity62 's then - @entity61 show to explain the game			0
meanwhile , @entity1 was becoming aware of it , too			1
" i started to kind of hear about it in strange ways , " said the actor , still boyish at 55			0
" people would come up to me and touch me and say , ' i 'm one degree ! ' i did n't really know what was going on			0
" @entity1 thought the game would be a fad			1
but it endured , and he eventually embraced it			0
" i do n't think it 's a great testament to my ability ( as an actor ) , " he said			0
" my movies just happen to be on a lot			0
" in 2007 @entity80 launched @entity81 , a charitable organization that connects celebrities with good causes for fundraising purposes			1
the " @entity1 " game has also inspired a website , the @entity87 , which lets people type in any actor 's name to see how closely they link with the " @entity92 " actor			1
the site assigns each celeb a " @entity1 number " to show the number of degrees of separation between the two			2
@entity98 now lets users type " @entity1 number " in the search field , followed by an actor 's name , to produce the same result			1
it 's rare to find a veteran actor who is not linked to @entity1 in some way , and rarer still to find a @entity80 number of 4 or higher			1
it helps that @entity1 has appeared in more than 65 movies , including many with large ensemble casts such as " diner , " " flatliners , " " @entity113 , " " @entity114 , " " sleepers , " " @entity116 " and " x-men : @entity118			1
" @entity1 , currently filming the second season of his @entity121 drama " the following , " admitted saturday that he occasionally needs to use the @entity87 himself			2
" whether it 's my age or my misspent youth , sometimes i forget whether i 've worked with somebody or not , " he said			0
" i 'll look at the call sheet , check the name , and then i 'll check their @entity80 number			2
that way i can go on the set and say , ' good to see you , ' or ' good to see you again			0
' " several other celebrities with tenuous ties to @entity1 joined him onstage saturday , including actress @entity134 , who noted that " ' @entity1 of @entity1 ' is really the idea of social media before there was social media			2
" the talk closed with fellow panelist @entity140 , editor of tech site @entity141 , shooting a @entity144 video of @entity1 with the audience waving in the background			2
that way , @entity1 said , everyone in attendance in @entity149 is now just one degree of separation away from him			2
@entity153 to @entity14 : we 're all being watched			0

actor thought ' @entity1 of @entity1 ' game was making fun of him
@entity1 : " i was horrified . i thought it was a giant joke at my expense '
@entity163 asks players to link other celebs to @entity80 by movies they have in common
