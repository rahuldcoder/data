@entity0 , @entity1 -- former @entity5 @entity4 leader @entity3 finally took the stand monday at the @entity8 's international tribunal at @entity9 to defend himself against genocide charges stemming from the 1992 - 1995 @entity5 conflict			1
for @entity2 's senior international correspondent @entity13 , the 64 year - old was as defiant and unrepentant as the man he recalled meeting outside @entity16 in 1993 - 94 , as @entity5 - @entity4 forces shelled the city			1
@entity3 , who faces 11 charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity , and genocide during the war , told the tribunal the @entity4 cause is " just and holy , " and dismissed as myths two of the worst atrocities of a conflict that claimed 100,000 lives -- the three - year siege of @entity16 and the @entity33 massacre in 1995			1
he even claimed that the image of the @entity36 as victims was untrue and that they were the first to attack			1
their fighters " had blood up to their shoulders , " he said			0
" i will defend that nation of ours and their cause that is just and holy , " he said in his defiant opening statement			2
the aim of the " @entity36 plotters , " he added , was " 100 percent power , as it was in the @entity54			1
" " this is reminiscent of those days , " said @entity13 , who reported from the @entity5 capital during the war			1
" these were the exact same justifications : ' we 're the ones that had been under attack , we 're the ones being wronged			0
' " it 's very telling that he 's not trying to address specific issues , such as the @entity33 massacre and such like , which are going to be the main parts of the prosecution			1
" many @entity5 - @entity68 watching this will feel that he 's doing the right thing because @entity68 have a history of feeling wrongly done to			2
" he said some still think back to their nationalist past and only identify with themselves through that , which is incompatible with the direction modern @entity79 is taking			0
" they 're trying to return to a kind of @entity4 nationalist heyday , which is akin to the @entity83 taking @entity36 , if you will , back centuries			1
" @entity3 is the most senior figure to stand trial since the former @entity89 president @entity88 , who died of a heart attack in 2006 before a verdict was reached			1
according to @entity13 , the trial might offer a crumb of comfort to some victims but it will stir up a great deal of emotion and anger to many @entity5 - @entity36 who lost relatives or their homes			1
" when you listen to @entity3 's description of the situation in @entity5 during this period it belies the fact that @entity5 - @entity68 went through and ethnically - cleansed people from their towns , " he said			1
" there were towns and villages where no @entity36 were left			2
any towns or villages the @entity68 could n't get into they just surrounded and poured on machine - gun fire and rockets			0
this trial is going to bring all this out again			0
" during the siege of @entity16 , which lasted 44 months , @entity3 was in @entity118 , a mountain - top village to the south - west of the capital which became the @entity5 - @entity4 headquarters			1
down below , @entity16 was like a goldfish bowl surrounded on all sides by @entity5 - @entity4 soldiers who had dug in and were shooting civilians indiscriminately with machine guns , sniper rifles and mortars			1
" these were men in uniform with weapons taken from the former @entity89 national army acting on clear instructions , " said @entity13			2
" it 's hard to get an idea of what a siege is like in modern @entity79			0
but imagine a city where you ca n't leave , get out to buy eggs , apples or fuel for your car			0
equally nothing can come in			0
" the encirclement of @entity16 was so tight that the only way in or out for @entity5 was a hand - built tunnel they dug under the @entity8 - run airport runway			2
a man could n't stand upright in the tunnel			0
" telephone lines were non-existent , while electricity and water supplies were often cut for weeks on end			0
" on one occasion , while buying fuel in @entity4 - held territory , @entity13 came across several @entity5 - @entity4 snipers at a gas station			1
they proceeded to show him their positions and what they could see through their rifle scopes			0
" looking down onto the streets you could see why the snipers were so effective , " he said			0
throughout the conflict @entity5 - @entity4 forces were supported by the rump @entity89 state -- which would later become @entity4 -- and its national army , which was dominated by @entity4 generals			1
" that chain of reporting command was important , " said @entity13			0
" i remember going to @entity173 with @entity3 and he was the like the vassal of @entity88			2
he was going there worried about what demarche he was going to get from him			0
so there was a complete tie - in between the @entity5 - @entity68 and the @entity4 in @entity173			1
" but in terms of the chain of command on the ground , i do n't think anyone there would question the fact @entity3 and his political allies gave the backing , justification and instruction for the army to act on the ground			2
" for three years you ca n't surround @entity16 and shell it as a political leader			0
he never once stood up and tried to stop what was going on and only condoned and supported it , having meetings with army commanders involved , such as @entity199			0
" @entity199 is the most senior fugitive still at large			0
now that @entity3 's tribunal has finally resumed after a four - month postponement , many analysts believe it has enough evidence to secure a conviction			1
" if there 's a successful conviction , " said @entity13 , " then the court should feel it has set a good marker for future leaders who would try to turn guns on civilians and try to divide a country			0
" @entity214 would call into the question the tribunal 's ability to try anyone			2

@entity3 faces 11 counts of genocide , war crimes , crimes against humanity
charges stem partly from 1995 mass killing of @entity36 men in @entity5 town of @entity33
@entity3 , the @entity231 president at the time , accused of *responsibility* for the massacre
he told international tribunal at the @entity9 that the @entity4 cause is " just and holy "
