-- left - leaning @entity1 won the @entity3 presidential runoff monday , ending a hard - fought campaign during which he promised to spread the benefits of @entity3 's economic boom to the poor			1
though vote - counting continued , his opponent , @entity8 , conceded defeat , according to state news			1
@entity1 had previously claimed victory at a nighttime rally in downtown @entity14 on sunday			1
" the nation will only advance if the @entity3 family advances , " he said to throngs of cheering supporters in the city 's @entity18 square			1
he vowed to create a unity government and said he would focus on helping the country 's most vulnerable			2
@entity1 also addressed the need to improve the nation 's infrastructure , water , sanitation and education , particularly in rural areas			1
those were promises he had made repeatedly throughout the campaign that set @entity1 , an ex-army officer , against @entity8 , a right - wing lawmaker and the daughter of a former president who is currently in prison on a 25 - year sentence for human rights abuses			1
with more than 90 % of ballots counted monday , @entity1 had 51.5 % of the vote , versus @entity8 's 48.5 % , according to the county 's official electoral body			1
his all - but - certain victory earlier in the day sent shocks through @entity3 's stock market			1
it closed early monday after its general index fell more than 12.5 % -- its biggest one - day drop ever			0
mining stocks , in particular , suffered			0
" this activity in the market is directly linked to the electoral process			0
@entity54 ( in the new government ) seems to be the issue , " said @entity52 , a financial analyst at @entity53 in @entity14			0
" the selling is being led mostly by foreign investors , " he added			0
" they 're the most sensitive because they do n't know what has been going on politically here in @entity3			1
" @entity52 urged @entity1 to move quickly in naming a new finance minister after he takes office on july 28 for months , the candidacy of @entity1 , a past ally of @entity67 president @entity66 , has made some investors uneasy			2
they fear he could introduce higher taxes and redirect policies that have helped to push economic growth			0
in a recent interview with @entity0 en @entity73 , @entity1 denied his goal was a @entity66 - style social revolution in @entity3			1
" when we speak about revolution , we 're speaking about a revolution in education , which is something fundamental , " @entity1 said			2
" we have to build our own future			0
we believe that the @entity67 model does n't apply in @entity3			2
" pollsters in @entity3 had said sunday that @entity1 looked likely to win the presidency , and election officials said the partial results were somewhat skewed in favor of @entity14 and other urban areas			1
rural regions , where @entity1 was expected to perform best , were slower to report			2
the runoff election was a face - off between two candidates with little in common			0
@entity1 , 48 , narrowly lost a 2006 election bid , in part because many saw him as a close ally of @entity67 's @entity66 , intent on turning the country to the left			1
that 's a point his rival , 36 - year - old @entity8 , hammered on throughout her campaign			1
at a closing rally last week in @entity103 , a historic avenue in the capital @entity14 , @entity8 went on the offensive as she addressed a crowd of thousands			2
" there are recordings and witnesses that prove that this gentleman is a good soldier of @entity66 , " she said to cheering crowds			0
" i am not going to allow other countries to interfere in the sovereignty of our country			0
i 'm going to defend it ! " @entity1 , a former army officer linked to a 2000 military uprising , has tried to distance himself from such perceptions , swapping his trademark red t - shirts for suits			2
like her opponent , @entity8 was forced to answer uncomfortable questions about her past during this year 's election			1
she is the daughter of former @entity3 president @entity127 , who is currently in prison on a 25 - year sentence for human rights crimes			2
many @entity3 credit the elder @entity8 with defeating insurgencies that ravaged the @entity133 nation for years and for enacting economic reforms that stabilized the @entity3 economy			1
however , he is also criticized for corruption , having an authoritarian streak and the widespread rights abuses that were committed under his watch			0
during the campaign , protesters accused his daughter of planning to grant the former president amnesty if she won , as she said she might do in a 2008 interview			0
she later backed away from those remarks			0
centrist candidates , including former president @entity149 , former @entity14 mayor @entity150 and former finance minister @entity151 , cannibalized each others ' votes during the first round of voting in april			0
in that round , @entity1 garnered more than 30 % of the vote , while @entity8 ended slightly above 23 %			1
under @entity3 law , only the top two contenders advance to a second round			2
after the elimination of the more centrist candidates in april , @entity3 's 2010 @entity162 literary laureate @entity161 , a former presidential candidate himself , described the race as a choice between " terminal cancer and @entity169			1
" @entity170 , a member of the @entity172 team of @entity174 analysts , said the election was a triumph of extremes			0
" this election was meant to be the election of a centrist policy continuity candidate , and what we have is a first round that has yielded a result between two extremes in the left and the right , " she said before the second - round vote			0
current @entity3 president @entity189 was not permitted to run for a consecutive term			2
" i will get behind whoever wins , " he said on sunday before voting closed			0
" the task ( of running the country ) is not easy and they ( will ) need everyone 's support			0
" the new president will face many of the same challenges @entity189 did : persistent poverty , protests around the rights to natural resources and violence from remnants of a leftist insurgency that helped to make @entity3 the world 's largest producer of coca , the raw ingredient of cocaine			1
on the eve of the election , five soldiers were killed in an attack in the country 's southern province of @entity219 , state news said			1
they were reportedly on their way to provide local police with additional security for the election when they were ambushed			0
@entity0 's @entity226 contributed to this report .			0
