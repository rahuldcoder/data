-- @entity2 users are rightly aghast that the company on sunday banned a user for openly criticizing @entity6 's coverage of the @entity7			1
after @entity8 , a @entity9 newspaper reporter for @entity10 , posted negative comments about @entity6 's tape - delayed @entity7 coverage ( including one executive 's work e-mail for viewers to make complaints ) , @entity2 alerted its business partner -- @entity6 -- and showed the network how to file a complaint capable of shutting down the offending user			1
both @entity2 and @entity6 apologized tuesday , and @entity2 restored @entity8 ' account			1
yes , the @entity22 should be appalled , but we should not be surprised			0
first off , @entity2 is a private , for - profit company			1
having provided a free service to millions of @entity29 users for years , the company is attempting to placate and even pay back investors who have been awaiting returns on millions of venture dollars			0
this means becoming more restrictive , more top - down and more corporate			0
last month , in an effort to raise advertising revenue , the company announced it was closing its @entity38 ( application program interface ) to third - party apps -- meaning people and companies can no longer make applications that stream @entity2 data			1
this makes it harder to see tweets from places other than @entity2 's own website			1
it 's an entirely less open service this way , but it also gives @entity2 exclusive control over how and where people access its content -- and advertisements			1
and now , as if to prove that it 's more of a corporate player than a tool for corporate critique and other radical activity , @entity2 has given its biggest partners a primer in how to ban users that offend them : simply ask us			1
tech : welcome to the @entity7 so is the @entity67 suddenly less free and open ? no. @entity68 -- at least as a technology -- is just as free as it was before			0
this is simply what happens when we rely on a highly centralized and privately owned tool for a capability that might best be accomplished through a more distributed technology			0
the @entity67 might be a big decentralized network , but @entity2 is a single , centralized node on that network			2
our tweets do n't self - replicate and spread ; they go to @entity2 , which then essentially broadcasts them to our followers			1
this is an efficient system , for sure , but it is also highly controllable			0
the extent to which our messages proliferate depends entirely on the kindness of @entity2 , a company that has priorities other than us			2
the alternative would be to sidestep @entity2 altogether , and re-create its functionality through less restrictive , distributed tools			2
we could use the messaging equivalent of @entity91 or @entity92 -- the peer - to - peer networks that let people share music and movies with each other			0
instead of downloading files from a central server , people get bits and pieces of files from one another			0
likewise , e-mail travels sideways from server to server , in bits and pieces , with no truly central administrator motivated to ban a particular user for what he 's writing			2
we may not like @entity2 for what it 's doing , but it 's not up to a multimillion - dollar corporation to act against its own short - term financial interests in favor of freedom of our speech			1
tech : meet the man who started # @entity120 it is , however , up to those of us who want a free and open @entity29 to make the effort to understand how our technologies work and who controls them			0
only then will we be capable of exploring alternatives to centralized corporate software , and of building and supporting them			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity134 .			0

@entity134 : @entity2 users appalled by ban of reporter 's access after @entity141 tweets
@entity134 : it 's no surprise -- *twitter* a corporation with concerns besides users
he says it sends message to corporate partners : ask us how to ban users that offend
@entity134 : users who do n't want to depend on @entity2 should explore and / or build alternatives
