-- early this week , i worked on my addiction treatment center 's detoxification unit			1
i treated teenagers and young adults , pregnant women and medical professionals			2
i saw older pain patients who , having lost control over their prescriptions , began using intravenous heroin , very much to their shock			2
many have developed hepatitis c and , for the first time in my state of @entity19 , i 've begun to see an increase in hiv infections			2
heroin addiction is a metastatic cultural cancer			1
crime , disease , suffering and death follow in its wake			0
heroin takes you down a darker road than even prescription opiate addiction			1
the death of @entity34 - winning actor @entity33 on sunday apparently proves the insidious danger of that very path			0
@entity19 is in the stranglehold of just such a transitional drug addiction epidemic -- it began in the late ' 90s			1
and we are not alone			0
recent reports of mass overdose deaths in @entity42 and @entity43 are strong indicators that the movement from overdose by prescription pain medication to heroin is national in scope			2
interestingly , the last 20 years has seen a paradigm shift in physicians ' attitudes about prescribing opioids to treat pain			0
before the @entity56 revised its pain treatment guidelines 10 years ago , doctors tended to avoid prescribing opioids for pain			0
but the revised guidelines , coupled with accreditation requirements reinforcing screening for pain , and pharmaceutical industry pressure to prescribe , greatly expanded use of opioid analgesics such as @entity67 and @entity68			0
opinion : what makes someone an addict that " perfect storm " created a prescription drug addiction epidemic in our state			2
@entity78 data from 10 years ago show the annual number of treatment admissions in @entity19 increased from a little more than 9,000 to almost 14,000 from 2002 to 2005			2
that same data indicated we had one of the highest rates of prescription drug addiction among adolescents and young adults in the country			1
it 's only been recently that the rest of the country has awakened to this crisis			0
in 2011 , the @entity92 called prescription drug abuse an " epidemic			0
" @entity19 was highlighted as having one of the highest volumes of prescription painkillers sold			1
is it any wonder that , with a vast , attractive market of prescription drug addicts at the ready , out - of - state heroin dealers seized the opportunity to flood @entity19 with their treacherous opioid drug ? in only two years , heroin has saturated every remote , rural corner of our state			1
they say a country always fights its last war			0
as we donned battle gear for the war on prescription drug addiction , heroin snuck in from the flank unnoticed			1
two years ago , the use of heroin exploded in @entity19 like a wave of napalm , incinerating lives , families and communities			1
our state report on substance abuse trends for 2013 reveals that " primary treatment admissions related to heroin or morphine have been increasing since 2010			0
" that means , for three years , more mainers have been seeking treatment solely for heroin addiction			1
opinion : how to stop deaths from drug ods heroin is no longer only an urban plague			0
in his state of the state address , @entity140 gov. @entity139 awakened @entity142 to how heroin is corroding lives in even largely rural states			0
this quickly spreading opiate addiction has every addiction medicine physician deeply concerned about the pressure to treat this chronic brain disease appropriately			1
we must respond by providing the proven - effective treatment , combining @entity153 - approved stabilization medications with holistic rehabilitation			0
one without the other simply does n't work to manage this chronic disease			1
addiction disease is just like epilepsy or diabetes in that it 's a lifelong diagnosis that demands lifelong management and vigilance by patients and their medical practitioners			1
the parents of my patients never sleep soundly , always waiting for the dreaded midnight phone call			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			2

physician @entity175 says his addiction unit is seeing spike in young , old heroin users
he says heroin use a cancer *sweeping* nation , calls prescription painkillers the *gateway*
he says *sellers* *descended* on @entity19 and region has seen surge in heroin addiction
@entity175 : treatments must see addiction as a chronic disease needing lifelong management
