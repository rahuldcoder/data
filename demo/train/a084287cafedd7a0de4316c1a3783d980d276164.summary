@entity0 , @entity1 -- just as @entity4 secured the @entity6 nomination , president @entity3 launched his presidential campaign with a weeklong celebration of his foreign policy accomplishments			1
he and others in his administration blanketed the airwaves to discuss the first anniversary of @entity15 's death , and the president made a surprise trip to @entity18 to boast that he had fulfilled his promises			0
the president 's campaign team rolled out a controversial ad that praised @entity3 for having made the decision to raid @entity15 's compound and went so far as to raise questions about whether @entity4 would have done the same			1
" which path would @entity4 have taken ? " reads the screen , followed by quotations and news stories about @entity4 criticizing the hunt for @entity15			2
only two election cycles after the @entity6 hammered away at @entity32 for being weak on defense and incapable of handling the challenges of the post- 9/11 era , @entity32 in the @entity33 are feeling confident enough to present their candidate as the person who has the more muscular foreign policy and the person who has made @entity41 safe			1
there are many reasons to feel this way			0
as @entity46 columnist @entity45 noted , " the polls could hardly be clearer , " with 53 % of @entity41 polled reporting they feel more trust in @entity3 than @entity4 in dealing with international relations			1
but the temptations to pound on this theme should not obscure the serious challenges the president faces in taking this path			0
though @entity4 remains vulnerable on national security given his minimal foreign policy record and the fact that @entity6 are still saddled by some of the most controversial parts of @entity62 's foreign policy record , namely @entity63 , @entity32 face significant risks if this becomes a central strategy			1
the first risk is that historically foreign policy is incredibly fickle			1
new crises can transform the politics of an issue within months , if not days , as the @entity72 revealed			1
many presidents have seen their national security advantage disappear quickly			0
in 1952 , president @entity75 and the @entity32 candidate @entity76 watched republicans turn the stalemate in @entity79 , which followed the fall of @entity81 to communism in 1949 , into a theme that undercut the political benefits from @entity86 's historic victory against fascism in 1945			0
@entity88 saw how his resolution to the @entity90 in october 1962 helped @entity32 hold on to their seats in the midterm elections , at a time when the @entity6 had been planning to highlight the president 's failed policies in @entity96			0
in 2003 , president @entity62 experienced this turnaround as well			0
after quick triumphs in @entity18 and @entity63 , his speech in front of a " mission accomplished " banner turned into a sign of weakness when the postwar battles proved difficult			0
although @entity62 won re-election in 2004 , the turn of events would severely undercut his popular standing throughout his second term			0
last week provided more examples : a few hours after president @entity3 's visit to @entity18 , bombs went off in @entity113			2
the diplomatic incident with the @entity81 activist @entity115 turned from a deftly handled situation into an embarrassing , and apparently botched , process			0
and this weekend 's elections in @entity119 and @entity120 have created great uncertainty about their austerity plans and , as a result , will likely result in turbulence in international stock markets			0
other presidents have learned about the second challenge of playing the national security card , namely that in economically bad times , boasting about foreign policy can make a president look as if he is avoiding the real issues			1
nowhere was this clearer than with @entity134 , who in 1991 , after the decisive defeat of @entity136 in @entity137 , seemed invincible			0
" the number of people who do n't like @entity62 , " @entity138 joked , " is almost down to the number of people running for the @entity32 nomination			0
" but as the recession worsened , @entity62 's desire to play up his foreign policy accomplishments made him look evasive and as if he did n't care much about domestic policy			1
@entity148 capitalized on this vulnerability with his campaign about economic policy			2
@entity62 went down to defeat			0
the third vulnerability is the fact that foreign policy has been notoriously messy in the post-cold war world			1
the kind of clarity that foreign policy had during the @entity160 , with a clear enemy and clear areas of competition , has been gone since the 1980s			1
that has been replaced by a world of foreign policy defined by amorphous terrorist networks , rogue states whose loyalties are constantly shifting and ethnic warfare in which it is difficult to distinguish the good from the bad			1
president @entity148 and vice president @entity173 learned how difficult it was to develop political capital in this world of foreign policy			1
despite a significant victory in @entity179 , where @entity41 air power helped bring down @entity182 's @entity181 , foreign policy success did little for @entity173 when he ran against @entity62 in 2000			1
the final danger is that president @entity3 could turn off some of the loyal supporters who he will need to energize to come out to vote , to organize and give money to his campaign , if the polls showing a close contest are to be believed			2
if @entity3 sounds too much like a hawk and engages in the kind of predictable national security scare tactics that other politicians , including his predecessor , used , he will further erode the image he held in 2008 of being a candidate who sought to raise public policy debates to a higher level			2
all these are reasons for the @entity33 to think carefully about whether the campaign theme rolled out in the past week should be central in the coming months			2
while the temptations are immense for a commander in chief who has enjoyed success to use that record as a battering ram against his opponents , the politics of national security are trickier than they seem			2
very often , those who are lured into making war and peace the message of their campaign find that the decision comes back to haunt them in november			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			2

@entity218 : *focusing* a presidential campaign on foreign policy is a risky *gambit*
new crises can transform the politics of an issue within months , if not days , says @entity218
fifty - three *percent* of @entity41 say they trust @entity3 more than @entity4 with foreign relations
still , the @entity3 campaign may want to *rethink* its current campaign , @entity218 says
