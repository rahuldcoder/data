-- at full speed , the @entity1 is little more than a cherry red blur , flashing from one corner of the horizon to the other in the blink of an eye			1
if its projected performance figures prove to be true , this radical electric concept car -- the brainchild of an award - winning young @entity12 designer -- could accelerate faster than all but two of the fastest supercars on earth			1
the @entity1 's figures are impressive			2
not just for an electric car , but for traditional petrol - engine cars as well			1
for years electric vehicles have been regarded as the frumpy inner - city siblings of their hardier countryside 4x4 brethren or zippier track - friendly supercar sisters			1
electric vehicles have tended to have names like @entity29 , @entity30 or @entity31 as opposed to @entity32 , @entity33 or @entity34			0
all this may be set to change when @entity36 goes into production			2
first unveiled at @entity39 in september , 2011 , the @entity38 is an electric vehicle that aims to be even faster than the @entity41			0
its precocious 25 - year - old inventor , @entity36 , says that the car produces 1018 horsepower , can accelerate from 0 to 100 kph ( 62 mph ) in just 2.8 seconds , has a top speed of 305 kph ( 190 mph ) , and can travel 600 kilometers ( 372 miles ) on a single charge			1
@entity36 says that he has always been motivated by the desire to demonstrate the superiority of electric over petrol - powered cars : " i have two passions ; cars and technology , " @entity36 says			1
" technology because @entity54 was born in @entity12 , and he invented the electric motor that is used in so many applications today			0
and i knew simply by theory that this motor is so much better to drive a car -- even a sports car			0
" i decided to combine my two passions , technology and cars and make an electric car that can prove the electric motor is much better even on the racetrack			2
not just city cars for boring stuff , but to show people that the future will be interesting -- that one day when petrol is gone and you only have electric cars in the world , you wo n't have to compromise in terms of performance , speed or ( how ) far ( it can go )			1
" while he was still in high school , @entity36 bought a lime green @entity79 for less than â ‚ ¬ 1000 and began modifying it with new parts			0
" i could n't wait to pull out ( the motor ) and put batteries and electric motors inside instead of the gas engine , " @entity36 says			1
after several years of rebuilding and alteration , @entity36 set a world record with his car , which became the fastest accelerating electric car in the world			1
the car is still recognized in the @entity93 for the fastest quarter mile by an electric vehicle			0
after setting five separate world records with his modified @entity79 , @entity36 began to work towards building his very own car from scratch			1
he enlisted the help of the highly - regarded young car designer @entity100 , and began work on the @entity102			0
now @entity36 is turning his dream car into a reality on a shoestring budget : " in the car industry , it 's common to design a new car with 1 billion to 5 billion dollars			1
but , most of those cars carry over components from previous versions -- engines , gear boxes and stuff			0
we had to design a car ( including ) the whole technology under the skin , ( while ) the company itself did n't have a desk to put a computer on			0
and we did all that with less than 0.1 % of the budget which is usual in the car industry , " @entity36 says			2
preliminary impressions from the automotive press have been generally positive , although many , such as @entity129 , said that they approached the concept of a vehicle that has " no sound , no downshift and no smell of burnt petrol " with trepidation			0
some also disputed the figures @entity138 has released , suggesting that their projected performance statistics may be ambitious			0
still , the notion that an electric car might soon not just match , but outperform the best petrol vehicles on the planet is certainly a captivating one			0
when @entity138 releases a production car into the wild in the not - too - distant future , the eyes of the world will certainly be watching .			2

the @entity1 is an electric - powered supercar
the car can *reportedly* accelerate from 0 to 100 kph in 2.8 seconds
*creator* @entity36 *claims* it can reach a top speed of *208kph*
he says he wants to " show people that the future will be interesting "
