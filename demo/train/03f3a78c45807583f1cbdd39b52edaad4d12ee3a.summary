-- i have smoked pot. not today or this week , or even this month , but i have			1
i 'm telling you this because before i begin talking about the pot - smoking habits of others , i thought it would only be right that i first owned up to my own past use			1
maybe this will encourage others to be a bit more honest because , like it or not , admitting to smoking pot is bound to get a lot less scandalous			1
three states -- @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 -- have marijuana legalization proposals on the ballot , and it wo n't be surprising if at least one of them passes			1
not medical marijuana , mind you , but the regulation and selling of small quantities for recreational use			1
if you thought @entity28 and @entity29 put @entity30 on the map , legal marijuana will make it out of this world			0
and i promise that will be my last pot joke , although being silly about pot illustrates why it 's taken this long for the country to begin adult conversations about marijuana , and not just knee - jerk rhetoric based on fear instead of facts			2
when president @entity46 signed the @entity47 , officially starting the so - called war on drugs , it was largely in response to pot - smoking hippies and @entity53 vets coming home addicted to heroin			1
@entity46 budgeted $ 100 million to fight what he called public enemy no. 1 -- illegal drugs			2
in 2010 , it was $ 15 billion			0
a trillion dollars has been spent on the war on drugs since it began			2
two government reports released last year had difficulty proving the billions being spent are making a big difference			0
in 1970 , the federal government listed pot to be more harmful than cocaine and meth			1
we now know that is n't true			2
that 's not to say legalizing pot is without risks ; it has been shown to impair concentration			2
but one study found alcohol was by far the most dangerous drug , followed by heroin and crack			0
@entity80 rated far down the list			0
so why do we continue to allow the @entity46 administration 's hatred of hippies to influence what we think about drug usage today ? i do n't know how much or how little tax revenue is actually going to come from state - sanctioned pot , but to me that 's not the point			1
the issue is n't how much money the government can make from pot sales , but rather , are the reasons why pot was originally classified as illegal still valid today ? now that we have studies that debunk the myth of longtime impairment from using pot , now that we see how ineffective the government has been in keeping pot off the streets , now that we have seen the gangland violence of drug cartels , should we still be looking at marijuana the way we did 40 years ago ? in the 1928 presidential election , @entity109 crushed his opponent , @entity111 , winning 40 states , in part because @entity111 was demonized as " the cocktail president			1
" @entity111 was in favor of repealing the 18th amendment -- prohibition -- while @entity109 believed he must enforce the law			0
it 's hard to imagine today , but alcohol was so vilified then there was an actual @entity122 dedicated to keeping it illegal			0
members even endorsed their own candidate for president			0
yet , just five years after that election , alcohol was legal			0
and even though @entity109 lost his bid for re-election , he did so supporting the repeal			0
that 's how quickly things can change			0
and that bit of history is what makes the results of these three states so fascinating			0
no one expects president @entity141 or @entity142 to come out in support of legalized marijuana within the next few days , but what will the conversation be like four years from now ? if the nation can go from upholding @entity117 to " drink up " in an election cycle , why could n't 2016 feature the first pro-pot president ? especially if next week 's results are , shall we say , favorable ? voting for a candidate solely because he or she lets you light up is stupid , but if all other things are equal , are we ready to vote to legalize marijuana the way our grandparents voted to legalize alcohol ? i think we are , but then one could say i 'm a bit biased			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			1
