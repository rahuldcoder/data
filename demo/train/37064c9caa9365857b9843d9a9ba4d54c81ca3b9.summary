@entity0 , @entity1 -- it is a very different year - and very different mood -- as @entity4 gather for their convention			0
but there is one carryover from 2008 : to win the @entity9 , @entity8 will once again have to make history			1
four years ago , it was a groundbreaking victory for the first african - american to win the presidency			1
now , to win four more years , it is a less glamorous but still significant barrier in his way : only @entity17 was re-elected with unemployment this high			1
but while the historic statistical models would suggest defeat looms in november , the president arrives in @entity0 with several key advantages in the race , and with an easier path to 270 @entity26 votes and victory than his @entity29 rival			1
among the advantages : incumbency : yes there are downsides to this , but the stage and powers of the presidency are on the whole an advantage , especially in a close , competitive race			1
more room for error : @entity43 needs to win @entity44 and @entity45 , and at least two of these three -- @entity48 , @entity1 and @entity49 -- to have a realistic shot at 270			1
@entity8 , on the other hand , enters his convention with several paths to cobble 270 together			1
@entity54 : what democrats need to do in @entity0 demographics : as long as the @entity29 has a crisis with @entity60 voters , there is a built - in @entity4 edge in several key states			1
@entity63 , not long ago a presidential swing state , is barely mentioned as a potential @entity29 target			0
and @entity66 is a competitive tossup despite the highest unemployment rate among the states and a punishing housing crisis			1
yet the challenges are obvious			0
while his path to 270 has more room for error , it is very different from the lopsided @entity4 advantage in 2008			1
then - sen. @entity8 won three states that had n't voted @entity4 for president in more than a generation -- @entity81 , @entity1 and @entity48			1
his campaign already concedes @entity81 is an almost - certain red state this year , and @entity1 and @entity48 are tossups			0
so are @entity49 , @entity85 , @entity66 and @entity86 -- all states where the president 's margin was fairly comfortable four years ago			1
poll : @entity43 47 % , @entity8 43 % in @entity1 the economy is of course the driving force behind the very different 2012 map and mood			2
the unemployment rate in february 2009 -- @entity8 's first full month is office -- was 8.3 %			1
last month , it was 8.3 %			0
to the @entity43 campaign , that is proof the president 's economic policies have failed			2
the @entity8 team , in turn , notes that unemployment hit 10 % in october 2009 , and argues that the president 's policies are , albeit slowly , helping pull the economy out of a deep recession he inherited			1
@entity8 says fatherhood trumps schmoozing in any event , the jobless numbers and other economic data make it all but impossible for the president to make the case @entity120 are better off today than they were four years ago			1
so his convention priority is to make the case that his approach is the better , fairer path to sustained recovery			2
the primary target : independents and conservative democrats in battleground states			1
" the thing i most love about them is how they discovered the middle class at their convention , " vice president @entity130 mockingly told a crowd sunday in @entity132 , @entity49 -- pushing the fairness argument			0
" was n't that amazing ? all of a sudden their heart was bleeding for the middle class			0
" where have all the protesters gone ? just as critical , if not more so , is the @entity8 tactical imperative of using the convention to re-energize his 2008 base			2
" do n't boo - vote , " was the president 's weekend appeal to a @entity86 college audience , and it is a snapshot of the 2012 nuts - and - bolts approach of a campaign team that understands it can not rely on the dynamics that motivated 2008 @entity8 voters			1
to be sure , he continues to enjoy a huge edge among african - americans , latinos and younger voters			0
but if @entity43 can make even marginal gains among those groups , or turnout dips even slightly , or both , it could make the difference in several key battlegrounds			2
the convention state of @entity1 is a test case of @entity8 2012 vs. @entity8 2008 in the ground game			1
also noteworthy in @entity0 , though likely somewhat less obvious than it was in @entity168 , will be the 2016 factor			0
@entity130 and @entity170 have busy @entity0 schedules , and the vice president of course has a coveted speaking slot			0
@entity130 is 69 , meaning he would be 73 at the 2016 convention , but he has not ruled out a third try for his party 's presidential nomination			0
@entity178 set to campaign on ' are you better off ' question @entity181 will have no @entity0 role -- inappropriate , she says , for a secretary of state			0
but as much as she says she is done with politics when this first @entity8 term ends , the convention has no shortage of @entity189 loyalists , including her husband , the former president			2
from there , as in @entity168 , the focus will be on ambitious next - generation prospects , among them @entity194			0
@entity196 of @entity197 , @entity198 of @entity199 and , for the first time in years , perhaps a @entity195 -- @entity202 's governor , @entity201			2
to look at a map searching for @entity4 of the future though , is to be reminded of a painful truth for the party gathering in @entity0 : president @entity8 is their undisputed leader , but the @entity8 presidency has been a time of deep @entity4 decline			2
when @entity8 took office @entity4 held : 56 @entity212 seats			2
it is 51 now ( plus two independents who align mostly with the @entity4 )			0
257 seats in the @entity216			0
it is 190 now ( there are also three vacancies for seats last held by @entity4 )			0
29 of the 50 governorships			0
it is 3,319 now .			0

no incumbent has ever been re-elected with unemployment this high
among @entity8 's advantages : incumbency , more room for error , demographics
independents and conservative democrats in battleground states are key targets
economic data make it hard to make case that @entity120 are better off than four years ago
