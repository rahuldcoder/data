-- @entity1 is a purist 's nightmare			1
she does n't just straddle pop categories , she dumps them in a @entity5 , whips them to a frothy @entity8 © e , then trains a guided missile at the whole mess			2
she is a rapper 's rapper , a master of flow and punch lines , with skills to please the most exacting gatekeepers of hip - hop street cred			0
but she 's a bubblegum starlet as well , delivering confections to the nation 's mall rats			0
" i 'm in the @entity22 lane , " @entity1 boasts on her second lp			1
it 's true : she 's one of the few performers who can rival @entity22 's blend of artistic bona fides and sheer star power			0
but @entity1 is also in the @entity29 lane , the @entity31 lane , the @entity32 and @entity33 and @entity34 and @entity36 lanes			2
( by the sound of " @entity38 " -- a blustery duet with @entity40 -- she can cruise in the @entity43 lane , too			0
) then there 's the @entity1 lane			1
" @entity53 " opens with @entity1 -- a biracial woman from @entity47 via @entity48 -- ranting in the voice of her ( @entity50 ? ) homosexual " twin brother " alter ego			1
in the same song , she takes on the voice of @entity56 , @entity1 's mother , singing in a cartoon @entity58 accent			1
" take your medication , @entity1 , " counsels @entity60 / @entity56			2
" @entity63 , quack to a duck and a chicken , too / put the hyena in a freakin ' zoo , " answers @entity1 / @entity1			2
later , she bursts into " @entity69			0
" she 's just limbering up			0
on " @entity53 , " the energy never flags -- it 's the rare filler - free mega-pop album , an achievement for a record that stretches to 19 songs and 69 minutes			1
@entity1 fans dismayed by her post- " @entity81 " turn toward pop will be cheered up by the red - meat hip - hop here			1
there 's booming triumphalism ( " champion " ) , electro - rap boastfests ( " @entity88 " ) and a couple of collaborations with her mentor @entity90 , in which she more than justifies the claim that ends the album : " i am the female @entity90			0
" the beats , by young comers like @entity95 and @entity96 , are taut and lively , a good match for @entity1 's manic spirit and comic zingers -- and comic anti- zingers			1
here 's @entity1 on taking in fashion shows with " @entity104 " editor - in - chief @entity103 : " when i 'm sittin ' with @entity103 / i 'm really sittin ' with @entity103 / @entity105 n't no metaphor punch line -- i 'm really sittin ' with @entity103			1
" beginning with @entity110 , the thumping " @entity111 , " " @entity53 " veers into radio pop , serving up club anthems , clobbering ballads and , on the dr. @entity109 - produced " @entity108 , " the most shameless @entity107 - wan na - be song ever recorded , a tune worthy of the ambition			1
the album is neatly utilitarian and bifurcated -- " @entity119 " for the hip - hop headz , " @entity120 " for teenyboppers			0
but why would you choose just one @entity1 ? with her , the point is plenitude : more boasts , more hooks , more craziness , more shape - shifting , more cognitive dissonance , more pleasure			2
if you believe that art and commerce and provocation and fun -- and hip - hop and disco and teen pop -- can all be one and the same , here 's a record for you			2
come , all ye faithful			0
