@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 election has ended in a hung parliament , as official returns show it is impossible for any one party to get a majority of seats			1
the leader of the largest party traditionally gets the first chance to form the government and become prime minister			2
but if no party has a majority , the sitting prime minister -- currently @entity16 -- has the right to stay in office and try to win a confidence motion in parliament			1
hung parliaments are unusual in @entity4			1
the last time it happened , in 1974 , voters were back at the polls within months			2
@entity2 's political contributor @entity27 , a veteran of 12 @entity4 elections , answers questions about a hung parliament			1
what exactly is a " hung parliament ? " to enjoy a governing majority in the parliament , a party -- realistically either the @entity34 , led by @entity35 , or the ruling @entity36 , led by prime minister @entity16 -- needed to win a minimum of 326 seats			1
that 's more than half the total of 650 being contested			0
a " hung parliament " is one in which no single party reaches that minimum number			1
without a majority in parliament , a government becomes dependent on mps -- or lawmakers -- from other parties to get its program voted through the @entity56 , the chamber which passes laws and legislation			1
@entity36 ended the parliament dissolved on april 12 with an effective working majority of 56			1
but the party only had to lose 24 seats to forfeit its majority due to some lawmakers not taking their places in the chamber ( such as those from @entity68 's @entity67 ) , some lawmakers not having a vote ( such as the speaker ) and some seats being vacant			1
so did n't the @entity34 get the most votes ? so they did			0
but the electoral arithmetic makes things more complicated			0
@entity1 , @entity76 and @entity77 do not have proportional representation			0
instead the @entity4 use the first - past - the - post voting system where winner takes all			2
the general election is not just a national contest but in effect a mini-election in every one of those 650 parliamentary constituencies			0
and because of a bias currently built into the @entity4 system , the conservatives in practice need a lead of more than 10 points in their share of the vote to be sure of winning even a single - seat majority			1
the boundaries of parliamentary seats are periodically revised to keep them close to a notional average size			2
but the officials charged with the task , and the lengthy appeals process over their decisions , ensure that parliamentary seat sizes do n't keep pace with population changes			0
currently the distribution favors @entity36 , which tends to spread its vote more evenly across the country and to win a large number of seats by small majorities , particularly amid the shrinking populations of inner cities			2
the @entity34 , by contrast , rack up huge majorities of " surplus " votes in some safe rural and suburban seats			0
one way to appreciate the inequity of the system is to note that in the 2005 election it took @entity36 on average 26,872 votes to win a parliamentary seat			0
the conservatives averaged 44,531 votes per seat and the @entity128 96,485			0
@entity36 's share of the national vote last time was just 36 per cent			0
but thanks to the way the system worked , that gave them 57 per cent of the seats in parliament			2
the conservatives needed to gain an extra 116 seats to have the barest majority of their own -- and they needed around a 10 - point margin for that			2
when did @entity4 last have a hung parliament			1
how likely is it this time ? the last time a hung parliament happened in @entity4 was in 1974			1
but election experts say that the prospects of a repeat have been increasing			0
back in the 1960s , the two major parties , @entity36 and @entity34 used to take around 95 per cent of the vote between them			0
at the last general election in 2005 they aggregated less than 70 per cent			0
not only have the @entity128 advanced ( they took 62 seats last time with 23 per cent of the vote ) but so have other smaller parties			0
in @entity76 and @entity77 in 2005 the @entity159 and @entity160 ( @entity161 ) won 10 seats between them			0
and in local government contests and @entity169 elections , fringe parties like the @entity164 , the @entity165 and the @entity166 have shown their ability to collect significant voting support			0
winning a national majority is getting harder and the expenses scandals of the last parliament may boost support for minority parties that are apparently less tainted by them			1
what happened in the last hung parliament ? why are financiers and business people seemingly so jumpy about the possibility of another ? @entity184 , the then @entity185 prime minister , called an election in february 1974 on the theme of " who runs the country ? " after battles with the trades unions			1
he failed to win a majority but took a bigger share of the national vote than @entity36 , which had four more seats than his @entity196 ( 301 to 297 )			2
@entity184 tried to stay in power , seeking to persuade the @entity199 to back him			0
they would not and so his opponent , @entity200 , formed a minority @entity36 government			0
@entity200 called a second election that year , in october , and that time won an overall majority of three seats			1
part of the agitation in some financial circles about the possibility of a hung parliament on may 6 derives from sheer novelty			1
the first - past - the - post system has so often produced a definite election result that @entity216 and currency speculators are suggesting that a minority government -- or a coalition of two or more parties -- would not be strong enough to take tough decisions at a time when the parlous state of the @entity4 economy needs decision and consistency at the top			1
but many @entity229 countries where proportional voting systems regularly produce minority or coalition governments seem to manage their economies perfectly adequately			1
and some calmer @entity235 and @entity216 voices have pointed out that @entity4 managed to run its affairs during @entity237 with a coalition government			1
so what is likely to happen this time ? that is the hardest question			0
@entity128 , the @entity128 leader whose party could hold the balance of power , says that he wo n't play kingmaker			0
that , he says , is a task for voters			0
he adds : " whichever party has the strongest mandate from the @entity4 people it seems to me they have the first right to try and govern			1
" all fine and dandy , except that he did n't say whether that " mandate " should be determined by which party had the most seats or which had the biggest share of the national vote -- which would n't necessarily be the same thing			2
@entity128 would not be keen to earn the ire of the @entity4 people by putting @entity16 back in 10 @entity259 , when @entity4 voters had refused to renew @entity36 's majority			1
but nor would his party stomach him working with the @entity264 conservatives			0
the money therefore goes on a minority government rather than a coalition .			2

a " hung parliament " is when no party has the minimum number of seats to enjoy a governing majority
the @entity4 last saw a hung parliament in 1974 , which saw two elections in the same year
many @entity229 countries regularly produce minority or coalition governments
there has been agitation in some financial circles about the possibility of a hung parliament
