@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity2 has escaped punishment after allegations of erratic driving behind the safety car in the @entity8 @entity7 last weekend			1
@entity9 ran into the back of @entity11 when they were racing behind @entity2			1
the @entity13 ruled that @entity2 would suffer no penalty after inquiring into the accident when @entity9 crashed into @entity11 in @entity16			1
@entity9 's original 10 - place penalty on the @entity19 starting grid was replaced with a reprimand			1
the stewards studied film of the incident , including amateur video footage , before announcing their verdict			2
they said : " having heard the explanation of all concerned and viewed both the original film of the incident which was available to stewards at @entity16 as well as the new film , what has become apparent is the view clearly expressed by all drivers and team managers alike that the conditions at @entity16 were exceptionally bad and worse than those experienced when the race starts behind the safety car			1
" because of those views , the stewards accept that it may be inappropriate to impose the penalty normally applied for an offence such as this			2
" in the circumstances the stewards will reduce the penalty imposed on @entity9 to a reprimand			1
" the involvement of @entity2 in this incident has also been considered in the light of evidence given by him , his team manager and in particular all other parties present and no penalty is imposed upon him			2
" the 22 - year - old @entity56 rookie , who drives for @entity57 , leads the race for the world championship by 12 points , with two rounds left , and there had been speculation that he might lose some of those points if the @entity13 found him culpable			2
@entity2 had strengthened his title bid with a superb victory at @entity16 in appalling conditions which twice saw the safety car deployed			1
as the field trailed behind the safety car on the second occasion , @entity69 's @entity9 drove into the back of @entity74 's @entity11 , causing them both to retire			1
the drivers , who were lying in second and third places behind @entity2 a the time of the accident , both criticized @entity2 for driving erratically and slowing up and down			1
the incident was missed by television cameras but footage , taken from the grandstand , was shown on the @entity85 web site			0
it appeared to show @entity2 pulling over to the right - hand side of the track and slowing down markedly , in turn forcing @entity11 to slow down , which caught @entity9 on the hop			1
@entity11 said : " it definitely contributed to @entity9 hitting me up the back because he ( @entity2 ) was n't doing what he was supposed to be doing , clearly			1
" he spoke in the drivers ' meeting about how good a job he was going to do and he did the opposite			0
still , we know for next time , " added the @entity99			0
@entity11 stressed , however , that he had not complained to the stewards about the incident			2
on friday he issued a statement saying : " i would just like to make it clear that , although i criticized @entity2 's driving in yesterday 's @entity107 , at no time have i made any official complaint about anyone 's driving following sunday 's @entity8 @entity7			1
" @entity2 , speaking at practice for the @entity19 in @entity113 , had protested his innocence before the verdict was announced			2
" i had a good weekend , i did n't put a foot wrong			0
i did n't do anything to put anyone else in danger , " he said			0
" i 've come away to @entity120 and all of a sudden i 'm going to be punished for something			0
" i just think it 's a real shame for the sport			0
@entity124 's supposed to be about hard , fair competition			0
that 's what i 've tried to do this year , just be fair			0
" there 's been some real strange situations this year where i 'm made to look the bad person and , by the looks of it , this weekend be given a penalty			0
" if this is the way it 's going to keep going , it 's not somewhere i really want to be			0
