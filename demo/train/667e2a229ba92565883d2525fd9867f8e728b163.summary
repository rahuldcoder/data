-- president @entity1 and @entity3 prime minister @entity2 on monday held their first face - to - face meeting since each took power , confronting a range of potentially divisive issues			1
@entity3 prime minister @entity2 and president @entity1 visit at the @entity10 on monday			1
at a pivotal moment in the @entity14 peace process , the two leaders met at the @entity10 to discuss , among other things , the endorsement of a two - state @entity18 solution and relations with @entity21			1
the issue of @entity21 's nuclear ambitions became an increasingly urgent one in recent months			1
@entity2 wants a time limit for negotiations relating to such ambitions , with the threat of military action if no resolution is reached			1
@entity1 is seen as unlikely to provide a timetable			0
both @entity3 and the @entity31 believe @entity21 is seeking nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear energy program ; @entity35 denies the accusation			1
@entity3 leaders have pointed to @entity21 president @entity39 's calls for the end of @entity3 as a jewish state and argue that quick action is needed			1
at an @entity44 news conference , @entity1 again refused to commit to an " artificial deadline " for @entity21 negotiations			1
but he also warned that he would not allow such talks to be used as an excuse for delay while @entity21 develops a nuclear arsenal			2
@entity1 said he expects to accelerate such talks after the june @entity21 elections			1
" i firmly believe it is in @entity21 's interest not to develop nuclear weapons , because it would trigger a nuclear arms race in the @entity14 and be profoundly destabilizing in all sorts of ways , " @entity1 said			1
it " is important ... to be mindful of the fact that we 're not going to have talks forever			0
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while @entity21 proceeds with developing ... and deploying a nuclear weapon			2
" he said the @entity31 is not " foreclosing a range of steps , including much stronger international sanctions , in assuring that @entity21 understands that we are serious			0
" @entity2 emphasized that although " the common goal is peace ... the common threat we face are terrorist threats and organizations that seek to undermine [ that ] peace and threaten both our peoples			2
" the prime minister called @entity21 the biggest threat to peace in the region			1
" if @entity21 were to acquire nuclear weapons , it could give a nuclear umbrella to terrorists , or worse , could actually give [ them ] nuclear weapons			2
and that would put us all in great peril , " he said			0
the divide between the two leaders -- @entity1 is considered to have a more conciliatory approach to the @entity95 world than @entity2 -- was dramatically illustrated shortly before their meeting by @entity3 's decision to begin construction at the @entity101 outpost of @entity102			1
a number of families evacuated from @entity105 are now being resettled in @entity102 ; several are living in temporary housing			0
a government spokesman said the construction 's start date and the timing of @entity2 's trip are a coincidence			2
@entity1 wants such outposts dismantled , along with an immediate freeze on settlement expansion			0
@entity2 wants to allow natural growth in @entity119 settlements in the @entity101 -- for example , allowing children who grow up in a settlement to build a home alongside that of their parents			2
@entity1 also supports the idea of a @entity18 state alongside a secure @entity3			1
@entity2 has not endorsed the idea , arguing that @entity3 needs security guarantees and a clear @entity18 partner for peace talks			1
" i want to make it clear that we do n't want to govern the @entity18			0
... [ if ] @entity3 's security conditions are met and there 's recognition of @entity3 's legitimacy -- its permanent legitimacy -- then i think we can envision an arrangement where @entity18 and @entity3 live side by side in dignity , security and in peace , " @entity2 said			1
pressed on the question of a two - state solution , the prime minister said he thinks " the terminology will take care of itself if we have the substantive understanding			2
" @entity2 and his @entity151 were sworn in march 31			0
a day later , @entity3 's new hard - line foreign minister , @entity152 , distanced himself from the @entity154 process , the 2007 relaunch of peace talks adopted by his predecessor , @entity157			1
the @entity158 issued a statement after the meeting criticizing @entity2 for failing to more explicitly endorse a two - state solution			0
@entity2 " missed yet another opportunity to show himself to be a genuine partner for peace , " chief @entity18 negotiator @entity162 said			0
" calling for negotiations without a clearly defined end - goal offers only the promise of more process , not progress			0
" @entity162 praised @entity1 for supporting a freeze on @entity3 settlement activity			2
despite their differences , @entity1 and @entity2 agree on numerous key issues , such as @entity31 military and financial support for @entity3			1
@entity1 highlighted his stance during his presidential campaign			0
@entity1 also supports funding for @entity18 entities not controlled by @entity182 , which controls @entity105 and which the @entity31 labels a terrorist organization			0
before making his trip to @entity185 , @entity2 met with leaders of @entity187 and @entity188 , viewed as potential partners in the effort to bring peace to the region			2
@entity1 will host @entity188 president @entity193 on may 26 and @entity195 president @entity194 on may 28			0
he is also scheduled to deliver a long - awaited speech on relations between the @entity31 and the @entity199 world in @entity200 , @entity188 , on june 4			0
some @entity18 leaders have expressed hope that @entity2 , under pressure from the new @entity31 administration , may soon choose to accept the principle of a two - state solution			0
" if , in fact , mr. @entity2 were to make an unequivocal statement about acceptance of this as a solution concept , then he should immediately be asked to begin , immediately , to implement @entity3 's other obligations under the road map , " said @entity207 , the @entity18 prime minister			1
the road map , put together by the @entity216 -- composed of the @entity217 , @entity218 , the @entity219 and the @entity31 -- calls on @entity3 to stop settlement building and @entity18 to stop terrorism			0
the plan was introduced in 2003 but immediately stalled			0
monday 's meeting between @entity1 and @entity2 was largely expected to be a chance for the two sides to discuss their positions rather than iron out differences			1
aides on both sides stressed that each leader views the other as a friend in peace efforts			0
@entity0 's @entity234 contributed to this report .			0
