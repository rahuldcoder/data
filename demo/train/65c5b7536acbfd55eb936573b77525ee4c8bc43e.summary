@entity0 losing the majority in the @entity3 was bad news for most national @entity5			0
but for a few of outspoken liberals -- especially those with higher ambitions -- the minority may be a bit more fun			0
for the next two years , liberals like sens. @entity15 and @entity16 -- a pair oft - discussed during 2016 speculation -- will be able to use the @entity18 control as a foil for their rhetoric and message			1
they will also be more unencumbered by difficult votes thrust upon them by the @entity24 and @entity5 leadership			2
@entity18 are now in control , meaning most votes they take will give them opportunities to blast their opponents and rally their base			2
@entity31 is retiring , not running for reelection in 2016 this was clear in the first meeting of the new @entity35 on thursday , when @entity36 -- who has repeatedly said she is n't running for president -- used her first speech to lambast @entity18 for kowtowing to foreign oil companies and business interests by pushing the @entity42			1
" i want to know why the pipeline is the very first , no. 1 item on the agenda in the new @entity51 , " @entity36 said of the 1,179 - mile - long project that would move oil from @entity45 to refineries in the @entity47			1
after making the case that the pipeline was not about jobs or energy costs -- two points @entity18 regularly make -- @entity36 upped her rhetoric			1
" so it 's not about jobs ; it 's not about energy			0
why is this bill so urgent ? the answer is money , money and power , " @entity36 said			2
" who does this new @entity18 @entity51 work for , foreign oil companies or the @entity47 people ? today , their first priority is to advance a pipeline that means a whole lot to lobbyists and a giant foreign oil company			1
" @entity15 , too , will likely use his position caucusing with the minority party ( the senator is an independent who chooses to meet with @entity5 ) to needle both @entity18 and the @entity78 administration			1
on free trade , for example , @entity15 has already staked out a position that is antithetical to the @entity24 when he wrote a letter to the administration blasting the @entity83 , a free trade deal with 12 @entity86 countries			2
in particular , @entity15 -- who is openly considering a 2016 run -- has accused the @entity24 of creating the agreement in secret			0
" it is incomprehensible to me that the leaders of major corporate interests who stand to gain enormous financial benefits from this agreement are actively involved in the writing of the @entity83 while , at the same time , the elected officials of this country , representing the @entity47 people , have little or no knowledge as to what is in it , " he wrote			0
" in my view , this is simply unacceptable , " he said			0
@entity106 @entity105 contributed to this report .			0

minority senators will have more freedom to needle @entity18 and buck their party
this could help a number of liberal senators , especially anyone eying the @entity24
@entity36 - who says she is n't running for president - showed this by *attacking* @entity18 on the @entity42 pipeline
