-- what is @entity3 's crime ? last weekend , the up - and - coming young actor , who will turn 12 this july 8 , starred in a remake of " @entity6 " that audiences flocked to beyond expectation and , from all available evidence , loved			1
given that @entity3 is front and center in more or less every frame of the 2 hour and 20 minute movie ( and given that his performance , as a kid who hides his sadness behind a mask of surliness , is to this critic , at least a magnetic and affecting piece of acting ) , i hope we can all agree that @entity3 's presence on screen had a little something to do with the movie 's success			1
yet @entity3 's rise has been greeted , in far too many quarters ( including a number of comment boards on @entity0 , like the one on my review ) , with bitter , gnashing resentment			1
this 11 - year - old really has the haters foaming			0
excuse me , but what the heck is going on ? let 's start with the indisputable fact that @entity3 got to be in the position he 's in because his father is the biggest movie star on the planet			1
so where , exactly , should that piece of information lead us ? should we hate @entity3 ? should we hate @entity47 ? should we hate every young actor or musician who ever got placed on the map of fame because of his or her parents ? ( @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , and @entity56			1
) oh , but , of course , the rap on @entity3 is that he 's all nepotism and nothing else , that he 's a kind of grouchy preteen @entity62 in cornrows			1
he 's been excoriated as a bad actor ( even though , just a few years ago , most viewers had nothing but praise for the appealingly feisty and precocious performance he gave right next to his dad in " @entity70 " )			2
he 's been called a brat , a spoiled no - talent , an ungrateful beneficiary of his lineage of stardom			2
he 's been ripped up and down as " insufferable " for his appearance last week on " the @entity77 with @entity78			2
" i caught up with the @entity78 spot a few days after the fact , when the @entity82 anger was already at full boil , and so i watched it with particular attention and fascination			0
here 's what i saw : @entity3 , seated opposite @entity78 , conducted himself very differently from most child actors			1
usually , kids in show business know how to present themselves as cuddly pets			0
@entity3 was having none of that			2
he has a very quick mind , and his responses were fast and a little brusque from the start , he was toying with @entity78 , putting him on the spot by giving him a lot less fake - nice , fake - sincere boilerplate chat - show banter than he wanted			0
( @entity101 , who in his right mind would want less of that ? ) it 's something that i 've occasionally seen adults do , and yes , it was a little startling to see a kid this young with a movie to hawk go onto the @entity78 show and assume that mock - confrontational , who 's - really - in - charge - here ? stance			0
but it would n't have worked if it was n't , in its way , a gripping little talk - show performance			0
( @entity78 himself played at being taken back , but also was taken aback ; it 's always a good thing when @entity78 gets jolted out of his stuffy protective pose , his robo - irony			0
) bottom line , for me : @entity3 was cocky as hell on @entity78 , but he was also interesting			2
for eight minutes , he displayed the confidence to be non-ingratiating and , in the process , he seized your attention			0
he was brash ; he acted like a @entity127 kid who truly had a mind of his own			0
perish the thought ! yet in the online universe of @entity131 , that @entity78 appearance played as one thing and one thing only : privilege			0
and that , on the surface , is what the whole ragging - on - @entity3 phenomenon is really all about the desire to tear down a child who enjoys the perks of celebrity royalty , even though he did n't earn them			2
and now he 's getting a movie career handed to him ! you can almost taste the class resentment , the jealousy of folks who only wish , deep down , that they 'd gotten such an opportunity themselves and now want to scrawl their rage on @entity3 's image like @entity155 going crazy with his @entity156			1
still , what 's most striking , and perhaps revealing , about this particular outpouring of toxic anger is that @entity3 's famous father , @entity47 , is n't just another big movie star he 's one of the most likable movie stars you could ever imagine			1
you 'd think that the general feeling about him , the nearly universal good will , would extend to giving the benefit of the doubt to his son			0
i know that when i watched @entity3 in " @entity6 , " the echoes of his father in everything from his cool , appraising glare to the nimble speed of his responses is something i enjoyed like , say , hearing that raspy echo of @entity180 in @entity182 's voice back in the " @entity183 " days			1
it 's not as if this sort of situation happens every day ; what would be so wrong with giving the son ( or daughter ) of fame a break and simply enjoying it ? it 's hard to shake the feeling , though , that too many people are trying to turn @entity3 from what he is , which is an insolently charismatic and hard - working young actor , into a focal point of ill will over issues of class , fame , money , and yes , i 'm going to say it race			1
for let 's be honest : does n't all the grousing about how @entity3 is " arrogant , " etc. , carry a special , ugly tinge of rancor ? does n't the complaint that he 's too big for his britches come painfully close to saying that he does n't know his place ? what do you think ? has the anger at @entity3 gotten ugly ? what do you believe it 's really about ? and who out there likes him as an actor as much as i do ? now that he truly does appear to be on his way to stardom , what sort of movie should he do next ? see full article at @entity0			1
