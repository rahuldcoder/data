-- hero pilot capt. @entity1 on tuesday joined the opposition to heightened airport security procedures that critics have called invasive and intrusive			1
@entity1 , who landed a crippled @entity6 jet on the @entity7 last year , said the use of full - body pat - downs and advanced imaging scanners for airline personnel " just is n't an efficient use of our resources			0
" federal transport authorities say the machines are both safe and a necessary security precaution , especially following recent airline terrorism attempts			2
@entity1 argued that transport authorities should trust pilots and flight attendants because " we 're trusted partners " who are already " thoroughly screened			2
" " we 're among the most scrutinized professional groups in the country , even more than doctors , " @entity1 said on @entity0 's " @entity24			0
" " it 's really not an efficient use of our resources to put us through this , " he added , suggesting that flight crews should be allowed to bypass much of the pre-boarding security screening that is required of passengers			0
@entity35 officials are permitted to use " professional discretion " in determining if individuals should be subject to further screening , according to a @entity35 statement			1
in a letter to aviation authorities , rep. @entity40 , @entity41 , raised the idea of privatization at transport hubs , which he said could improve efficiency and enable airports to opt out of @entity35 safety regulations			1
" it is both inappropriate and inefficient for the @entity35 to serve as the administrator , quality assurance regulator , operator and auditor of its own activities , " @entity40 , currently the ranking member of the @entity51 , said in the letter			1
" my aviation subcommittee staff would be pleased to assist you should you move forward with your decision to opt to have a certified private screening program at your airport , " he said			1
meanwhile , the @entity63 , a civil liberties organization aligned with the @entity66 right , filed suit against homeland security secretary @entity68 and @entity35 administrator @entity69 on behalf of two pilots who refused both the full body scan and the pat - down			1
" @entity35 is forcing travelers to consent to a virtual strip search or allow an unknown officer to literally place his or her hands in your pants , " said @entity63 president @entity63			1
it is not clear whether private screening is more efficient than @entity35 procedures or whether such screenings would meet federal safety standards			1
earlier on tuesday , a public interest research group said it is suing the @entity86 in a freedom of information lawsuit intended to obtain medical records and studies that it says the agency has relied upon for its use of body scanners			1
the @entity95 has also asked authorities to suspend the use of advanced imaging technology and called for public hearings into its use , center spokesman @entity94 told reporters on tuesday			1
consumer advocate and former presidential candidate @entity103 joined @entity94 in the group 's request for more information , calling the agency secretive and unresponsive			1
" [ scanners ] present hazards when they malfunction or when they function routinely , " he said			0
@entity103 said radiation emitted by the machines was potentially hazardous to passengers , but acknowledged that most passengers in 2009 had actually favored the new measures			0
transport authorities say advanced imaging technology meets national health and safety standards			2
" these things ... have been examined six ways to sunday , " @entity123 said on monday			1
" the [ @entity127 ] , @entity128 , the @entity130 @entity129 have all measured the radiation involved in an @entity132 , " she said			0
" it 's almost immeasurable , it is so small			0
" in a report posted on the @entity127 website , scientists say full body x-ray scanners pose " very low health risks			0
" the @entity127 evaluates radiation - emitting products as well as foods and medications			0
but a representative for @entity144 said the group did not evaluate the advanced imaging machines for passenger safety			2
" that was not our role , " said spokesperson @entity148			0
" we measured the level of radiation , which was then evaluated by @entity35			1
" @entity0 could not independently confirm whether scanners pose a risk to passenger health			0
transport authorities say that passengers concerned about the technology can decline the full body scan and instead opt for manual hand - searches performed by @entity35 officials			1
but some passengers and pilots have expressed objections to @entity35 's too - close - for - comfort pat - downs			1
over the weekend , a 31 - year - old man refused a pat - down at a @entity171 , @entity170 , airport			2
after arguing with a @entity35 agent , @entity172 left the airport facing a possible $ 11,000 fine , according to @entity176 , the @entity35 's federal security director in @entity171			1
anyone who refuses to complete the screening process will be denied access to airport secure areas and could be subject to civil penalties , according to a @entity35 statement , citing a federal appeals court ruling in support of the rule			1
the ruling from the 9th @entity188 says " requiring that a potential passenger be allowed to revoke consent to an ongoing airport security search makes little sense in a post- 9/11 world			2
such a rule would afford terrorists multiple opportunities to attempt to penetrate airport security by ' electing not to fly ' on the cusp of detection until a vulnerable portal is found			2
" @entity172 called the incident ridiculous and said he will not fly " until these machines go away			0
" the mood among security officials is " anger over the way the media is playing this story , " according to a senior homeland security official			0
" you had a dutiful [ transportation security officer ] , someone who works on the front lines to protect this country from a terrorist attack , someone who did everything by the book and according to his training , and he was accosted and verbally abused by a member of the traveling public , " the official said			2
" the fact that some in the media would hail the traveler as a kind of folk hero is shameful			0
" the incident sparked a debate over passenger safety and personal privacy that has remained headline news , just ahead of the holiday travel season			0
@entity69 , addressing a @entity237 @entity236 hearing on air cargo safety , veered off topic to plead with the @entity130 public to see airport security " as a partnership			1
" " those security officers there are there to work with you , to ensure that everybody on that flight has been properly screened , " he said			2
" everybody wants that assurance , so just try to be patient , work with our folks			0
they are there to protect you and your loved ones , and let 's make it a partnership			0
" @entity69 also sent a memo to @entity35 staff praising the work of officers -- including those who met with @entity172 in @entity171			1
" everyone involved with these latest incidents put into practice their training and experience , as you all do every day on the front lines to protect our country from terrorist attack , " he wrote			0
" they did their work with calm professionalism even as they were faced with a confrontational situation			0
