@entity1 , @entity0 -- forget your preconceptions			1
erase your stereotypes -- or at least set them aside for a moment			0
the @entity7 , this ancient land battered by powerful forces and mystical passions , is full of surprises			1
i have traveled in and out of various countries in the @entity7 over the course of decades			1
all too often and in too many places , aspects of life made it seem as if the clock became stuck in a different time			0
here are five signs the @entity7 is changing in ways you may not have expected : 1			1
instead of politics and religion , try tango and salsa : it 's true ; politics and religion remain at the core of much that goes on here			1
and it is also true that @entity0 has stood near the front of @entity33 modernity in many respects			1
still , you might be surprised to find that for many , the passion for tango and salsa weigh more than ideology and sectarianism			1
after the sun sets over @entity1 , @entity0 's capital , local nightclubs become thick with smoke and crowded with hip , fashionable , often apolitical young @entity33			1
@entity44 , 32 , an @entity46 exile , is one of a large group that has become a fixture of the @entity1 nightlife			1
these clubbers greet each other with kisses on each cheek and take to the floor as skillfully as any of their counterparts in @entity56			0
they twirl and swing their partners to the rhythm of the music and to romantic @entity61 lyrics that are probably as mysterious to them as @entity63 to the songs ' @entity56 composers			0
there is tango night at the @entity68 , overlooking @entity1 's glinting skyline , and nightly salsa at @entity71 's , with a live band on contract directly from @entity74			1
@entity44 , who casually calls himself a " @entity75 , " says he has no interest in politics and goes out dancing " minimum twice a week			0
" his friends say it 's much more often			2
the nightclub scene , with loud music , swaying hips and lively interaction between men and women , is ostensibly apolitical , but no one would mistake it for anything but a sign of a yearning for a modern , worldly , even secular @entity7			1
humor has become a powerful weapon , and it is terrifying the pious and the mighty			2
since the start of the @entity33 uprisings , the @entity93 has won almost every major election in the region while progressive liberals have looked incapable of mounting a credible campaign			2
now , however , modernizers have discovered a new tactic : if you ca n't beat them , laugh at them			0
satirists and comedians , with immense reach because of the @entity108 , are making fun of @entity111 politicians , particularly in @entity112 , sometimes just by quoting their own words and replaying their fiery sermons before amused young audiences			0
the government is clearly nervous and scrambling for a response , accusing comedians of denigrating @entity118 and insulting the president			0
but it 's hard to defeat someone who is laughing at you , pointing out your hypocrisy			2
authorities are going after comedians , in the case of @entity112 , dancing around its stated respect for free expression			0
and comedians are becoming more popular with every arrest warrant			0
@entity129 , arrested and released on bail a few days ago , is known to many as the @entity112 @entity132			0
he has more than 1.2 million @entity134 followers and is famous across the region			2
his television show has tens of millions of viewers , and his videos are watched on @entity139 by millions more , who laugh at the powerful , the pretentious and the holier - than - thou			0
his humor goes after everyone , including liberals			2
but his biggest success has been in wiping away the aura of sanctity , the claim of divine wisdom that had enveloped religious authorities			0
when his " sin meter " explodes , measuring a government attempt to justify economic policies on religious grounds , when he hugs and caresses a pillow with a picture of president @entity153 , he undermines @entity118 more effectively than any liberal ideologue			0
that 's why prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for him ( he 's out on bail )			2
it 's why satirists have been imprisoned in @entity165			0
it 's why the ultra-religious have prevented comics from performing in @entity169			0
it 's why one recent satirical piece on a @entity7 politics and culture site declares that @entity112 has decided to eradicate humor			1
when an @entity56 president shows up , it 's not that big a deal			1
president @entity178 came to @entity1 , and most people paid little attention			2
there were no throngs in the streets as the motorcade zoomed across town			0
people in rooftop restaurants gazed out curiously , but no one would accuse the @entity56 president of bringing life to a standstill in this city			0
the @entity193 is no longer seen here with the awe -- negative or positive -- that it once inspired			1
conspiracy theorists accuse @entity198 of installing the @entity93 in @entity112 or of starting the war in @entity200			0
others complain that it 's not doing enough to stop the @entity200 slaughter , and many accuse it of being too friendly with @entity206			1
but to anyone who has visited the @entity33 world over the years , it is clear the obsessive thinking about @entity56 is , at the moment , a thing of the past			0
fewer people buy the theory that it 's all about @entity206			1
when it comes to @entity206 , there is widespread and intense animosity			2
and yet in conversations with people here , and even in the views expressed by an @entity33 columnist , the old theory that all the @entity7 's problems originate with the jewish state has little currency			1
it was an old tactic of the dictators : to blame it all on @entity206 while fanning the flames of resentment			2
but two years after @entity231 -- after the toppling of tyrants , amid raging civil wars and worsening economic crises -- people largely dismiss the idea that establishing a state for @entity239 , while desirable , or even removing @entity206 altogether , would repair the region 's economies , improve the status of women and religious minorities , or end fighting between @entity246 and @entity247			1
when @entity111 parties called for a million man march against @entity206 in @entity1 , about 300 people showed up			1
even kings say they want democracy : the @entity254 did not flower quite as fragrantly as people had hoped , and that has reduced the pressure for change in places such as @entity0			1
but demands for reform continue			0
among those calling for more democracy , of all people , are nonelected rulers , such as @entity0 's @entity266 not everyone believes his pledges to democratize , but at least on the surface , the opposition and the king agree that @entity0 should move toward a constitutional monarchy			1
@entity274 's king has ushered in some reform , as have , to a lesser extent , other @entity33 monarchs			0
the @entity7 is not the same			2
change is in the air , but the stereotypes and preconceptions do n't do it justice -- just ask the salseros in @entity1 's nightclubs			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity289 .			0

@entity291 : the @entity7 shows signs of change new to a *frequent* visitor to the region
she says @entity1 , @entity0 , club scene with tango , salsa shows yen for modern , secular world
she says governments chafe at new use of political humor , and @entity193 less an object of awe
@entity309 : @entity206 seen less as root of region 's troubles , and even kings say they want democracy
