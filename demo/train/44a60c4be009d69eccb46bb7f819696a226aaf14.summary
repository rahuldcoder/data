by an 8 - 4 vote , the board chose to reprimand president @entity17 instead of putting him on administrative leave as administrators have done to the band 's director , @entity20			1
during the board meeting , @entity23 trustee @entity22 proposed administrative leave for @entity17 because he said the university " did not act " following the death of @entity28 , who died last month after a halftime performance in a football game in @entity0 , @entity1			1
but @entity22 dropped the proposal , and the board delivered a reprimand instead			1
as he argued to put @entity17 on leave , @entity22 noted how the board of governors of the @entity36 took action before the university 's trustees could			1
" it 's been 19 days since the death of a student occurred , a death of a student that was in our structure of authority			1

what is right is right , " @entity22 told the board thursday			2
" this student was under our care , under our authority			2
we did not act , we did not meet , we generally punted on this issue , " @entity22 added			1
" i 'm of the opinion the ( @entity36 ) board of governors stepped in to fill the vacuum , when they did not have to			0
i believe that had we shown action -- prudent actions -- there would not have been a cause for them to have an investigation because we would have been conducting ourselves in a sound manner			0
the board of governors stepped in in an attempt to do our job , " he said			0

" " we have taken all the actions that are part of policies , practices and procedures in dealing with allegations of hazing			0
once allegations of hazing are ( determined to be ) true , they are immediately referred to our police department if it occurs on campus or to the @entity96 if it occurs off campus , " @entity17 said			0
