-- as power couples go , they have the sparkle to supersede even @entity4 and @entity5			0
he 's a decorated soccer star with a @entity8 title to his name ; she has sold over 70 million albums worldwide			1
no wonder then , that @entity13 and partner @entity14 were included in @entity16 ' 2013 list of the world 's most powerful pairings , with @entity19 and @entity4 nowhere to be seen			1
" maybe it seems like it 's really difficult to manage everything but we are trying to do it as naturally as we can , " @entity13 told @entity0 's human to @entity21			1
read this story in @entity26 " it 's true that maybe sometimes we have to deal with some paparazzi but then i think we are now four years together -- you have to accept it and deal with it and it 's no problem			1
" as a stalwart in defense for @entity26 giants @entity36 , @entity13 can count three @entity37 crowns among his total of 19 domestic trophies , as well as the @entity40 and 2012 @entity41 with @entity42			1
@entity14 had a no. 1 hit single in 55 countries with " @entity45 , " is a judge on @entity48 talent show " @entity49 " and garnered 595 million @entity51 views ( and counting ) for her 2010 @entity8 song " @entity53			1
" it was during shooting for the video that the two met ; four years later they now have a son , @entity59 , and count as one of the most internationally recognized couples on the planet			1
so how do they try to maintain a normal life in the midst of all the attention ? " we do n't do very different things than the others , " @entity13 explains			1
" we are like a normal family and we try to spend a lot of time with our son and before that , just to be a good couple -- going to the cinema , going to have dinner			1
" @entity13 is no stranger to scrutiny , though			2
playing for one of the world 's biggest football clubs means every pass , tackle or movement is magnified and examined in minute detail by a menagerie of pundits and supporters			2
that intensity of spotlight can easily manifest itself into pressure , and also fear of failure -- even though that word is barely part of @entity36 's recent lexicon			2
but if ever the 26 - year - old required a reminder that losing is not the @entity99 , he only needs to look into his young son 's eyes			1
" it changed everything , " @entity13 says of @entity59 's arrival in january last year			1
" you can see that he is new in this world and he does n't have negative connections -- he 's all about laughing , smiling , being happy			0
it 's so funny ; i enjoy a lot playing with him			0
" we lost 3 - 0 against @entity112 in the semifinals of the @entity37 last season and i was really worried and really sad because it was a bad game and then i arrived home , saw @entity59 and everything changed			2
" it 's great because he 's just 12 months now and it 's unbelievable , he is starting to walk and we are enjoying this time a lot			0
" @entity13 insists there will be no obligation for his son to support @entity36 -- even though he was enrolled as a member upon birth -- but it seems inconceivable the inextricable link between the club and his family will ever be lost			1
four generations of the @entity13 clan have been @entity36 members and @entity13 's grandfather , @entity135 , served as a club director for 23 years			1
@entity13 was infused with a love for the team at an early age , recently telling the club 's magazine he sings @entity36 's anthem every night before he goes to bed , explaining that it is " the only song i know all the way through			1
" so what exactly does @entity36 represent for him ? " it means a lot , " he replies			2
" it feels like i 'm at home when i 'm here in @entity150 ( @entity36 's stadium )			2
" for me since i was five or six , i came here with my family to watch every game every weekend and it means a lot to me now to be a first - team player because it was my dream since i was a kid			0
" i 'm enjoying every moment , every year i 'm here , and it 's good because in the last few years we won a lot of titles and i think we are having a really good moment			2
" ' more than a club ' @entity36 certainly lives up to its " more than a club " motto which is rooted in its pride of the @entity167 region it inhabits			2
the club 's axiom allies the promotion of the area 's language and culture alongside good causes ( the players still bear the name of worldwide charity @entity178 on their shirts )			0
their fans even staged a pro-independence protest in october 2012 during one of the biggest games in world football -- " @entity185 " against @entity186 -- by singing the @entity189 national anthem mid-match			0
credited with an estimated 270 million fans worldwide , @entity36 is a global advert for @entity167			2
" i think for @entity167 , @entity36 means a lot because it is one of the top clubs in the world and that means that it 's a way to show what @entity167 is in the world , " @entity13 says			1
" because sometimes , we are really small and @entity36 is an instrument to show to the world that we are good at a lot of things			2
one thing is to play football really , really well so for the @entity189 people , the team is really important			0
" not only the soccer team because we have basketball , handball and a lot of sports			0
i think the @entity189 people really identify with @entity36 -- the fans are really proud of the team and the club			2
" the magic of @entity218 if @entity36 is a symbol of pride for @entity167 , then so is its prized possession -- @entity218			0
the @entity223 striker was crowned @entity224 four times in a row -- that run was ended by @entity186 's @entity228 this week -- and is feted as one of the greatest footballers the game has ever produced			0
he moved to @entity42 to join the famed @entity233 academy aged 11 , alongside @entity13 , and has spearheaded @entity36 's assault on all the glittering prizes club football has to offer			1
the team has claimed 16 trophies since the start of the 2008 season , when @entity13 returned after a four - year spell at @entity241 in @entity242 , and @entity218 's mountain of goals during that time have played an instrumental part in their success			1
and @entity13 says it is a privilege to play with the 26 - year - old , who netted an incredible 91 times in 2012			1
" i was at the @entity251 ( awards ) when he won and it was just amazing what he did , " he says			0
" it does n't matter now if he 's injured and there 's some people that are saying maybe now he 's not the best , but for me he always will be the best			0
" he made all these fans in @entity36 enjoy a lot , playing such a great football and he made us win a lot -- the @entity37 , the league			2
" we understand each other just with a look one to the other			0
people like @entity218 or @entity271 , it 's been like half of my life playing with them since we were 12 or 13 so we know each other a lot			0
" when we are on the pitch , we know what he will do , what @entity278 will do because we 've known each other for a long , long time			0
" move to @entity281 for a spell early in @entity13 's career though , it looked like his @entity36 dream would n't be realized			1
he moved to join @entity241 in 2004 , spending four years under the tutelage of @entity287 , one of the most decorated managers in the history of the game			0
@entity13 credits his time in @entity242 as a steep learning curve , adapting to new methods on the field , and a new language and culture off it			0
" i went there as a kid and i think i came back here in @entity36 as a man , " he says of the time he spent under @entity287 , whose 26 years at @entity241 were littered with trophies			1
@entity8 dream with @entity36 top of the @entity26 league and having made it to the quarterfinals of the @entity37 , another silverware - laden club season awaits			1
but looming large on the horizon is the @entity8 in @entity309 , where @entity42 can become only the third team in history to defend the title			1
" my goal is to try to win it again , " @entity13 says			0
" i think our careers are not very long			0
you can play 12 or 15 , maybe 20 years if you are a good professional and you are lucky with the injuries -- you have to try to win anything you can			0
" there are some really good players that did n't win anything in their careers , and we are really lucky to be part of a team like @entity36 and a team like the national team of @entity42			1
" even if @entity13 's career was to conclude tomorrow , he could still look back on a litany of fond memories and several years of almost unparalleled success			1
and it is almost certainly his deep bond with @entity36 will persist long after he hands up his boots			0
" now i 'm 26 and i hope i can play here for i do n't know six , seven , eight years more but you never know what will happen in the future			0
" maybe as a coach ; i can not see myself now being a coach but maybe as a president , you never know			0
