when a mainland @entity2 tourist heard about a bookstore in @entity4 that sold books banned by @entity6 , he knew he had to check it out			1
the @entity6 native traveled to @entity4 for a weekend in july and stopped by @entity9 in @entity10 to see if the rumors were true			2
" i want to know the inside stories of the party , " said the man , who did not want to be identified because it was illegal to bring the books back home			2
" it has nothing to do with me personally but there is no way you can get those inside @entity24			2
" in mainland @entity24 the government places strict controls on mass media , which often means that political analysis and controversial accounts of @entity2 history are impossible to find within the country 's borders			1
however , entrepreneurs in @entity4 -- a special administrative region of @entity24 that has freedom of press -- are cashing in on the ban to cater to the millions of mainland @entity2 who travel to @entity4 to shop			1
bookstores such as @entity9 stock their shelves with forbidden tales of everything from the @entity46 crackdown of 1989 to the ongoing scandal of ousted @entity49 official @entity48			1
@entity50 , the owner of @entity9 , has seen a growing flood of mainland @entity2 customers since he opened the store in 2003 , the same year @entity4 was opened to an increasing number of independent travelers from @entity24			1
in 2011 , @entity4 had 28.1 million visitors from the mainland , compared to 13.6 million in 2006 , according to statistics from the @entity59			1
now , " 95 % of the customers are from mainland @entity24 , " said @entity50 , a @entity4 native			1
the @entity9 has opened an account on @entity24 's microblogging site @entity62 to inform their @entity2 customers of new selections and to take orders			1
most buyers are from developed cities like @entity6 , @entity68 and @entity69 , @entity50 said			0
they range in age from 30 to 40 years old and are scholars or businessmen			0
even @entity2 government officials and police chiefs have come through his doors			2
" some of them show me their police ids when checking out " to prove they are government officials , @entity50 said			0
as a businessman , @entity50 said he does n't care too much about political rumors and scandal , but his book selection taps a huge potential market			2
" @entity24 is short of information and freedom of expression compared to @entity4 , " @entity50 said			1
" besides luxury goods , i thought it could also be an attraction for mainland @entity2			1
" he said that he sells between 200 and 300 books a month			2
@entity90 , a political professor at the @entity91 , said part of the allure for mainland @entity2 is that reading such books makes people feel like they are political participants , rather than just helpless observers			1
that also explains why many @entity4 locals do n't pay much attention to the bookstores			1
in democratic societies like @entity4 people do n't exhibit the same passion for reading political books since they have adequate ways to get information and be involved in politics , @entity90 said			1
but this information climate also provides lots of room for rumors and falsehoods			0
" @entity113 are more keen to read ( whatever they can ) , " said @entity90			0
" rumors then get the opportunity to spread			0
" on a recent friday night dozens of customers sat in the store browsing selections at @entity9			0
" i found some books ridiculous , " said a stock broker from @entity120 , in @entity121 , who stopped in the bookstore while his wife and daughter shopped nearby			0
" i think our country is the best place to be			0
" when returning to @entity24 , his customers risk having them confiscated at customs , @entity50 said			2
still , many make repeated trips to obtain the books , he added			0
but it 's not a defiance of the @entity49 that fuels his desire to read these books , said the customer from @entity6			1
" just because i 'm reading these books , does n't mean i 'm @entity141 , " he said			0
" in fact , if the people have more access to the decision - making process they can give suggestions and provide their wisdom			0
" as long as it does n't hurt the fundamental well being of its people , i do n't see a reason for the country to ban the information , " adds the man , who left with several political magazines in tow			0
" after all , we want the country to be better and our lives to be improved			0
