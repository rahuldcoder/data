-- most of us wake up from nightmares relieved that we 're safe in bed			0
but a small fraction uncontrollably act out their dreams as they unfold , endangering themselves or others			0
the recent movie " @entity11 , " about a struggling stand - up comedian and his issues with sleep , brings to light a rare condition called @entity10 behavior disorder			1
this film is not a documentary , but lead actor and director @entity18 has said that many events , including the dangerous behaviors while asleep , are based on his real life			0
@entity23 , @entity18 's character , drives hundreds of miles to any comedy gig he can possibly get to , away from the girlfriend he is n't sure he wants to marry			0
in the midst of all this , @entity23 experiences dramatic episodes of acting out his dreams			0
for instance , while staying at a hotel alone , he jumps through the window of his room because , in his dream , he 's being pursued by a missile targeting him			0
although the film is called " @entity11 , " @entity23 is n't sleepwalking per se -- he 's kicking , running , climbing on top of things and falling off them			2
after repeatedly delaying a doctor 's visit , he finally gets the diagnosis of @entity10 behavior disorder , which affects less than 1 % of the population , according to the @entity45			1
unusual patterns of behavior that people exhibit while sleeping are called parasomnias			2
most of them are most likely to happen when a person is sleep - deprived and under stress , said @entity54 , assistant professor of psychiatry at the @entity56			1
sleepwalking and @entity10 behavior disorder are two examples of parasomnias			1
sleepwalking happens during non-rem sleep ; it usually involves walking around and perhaps mumbling			1
comedian @entity18 on truth and fiction in ' @entity11 ' @entity10 is a stage of deep sleep during which certain parts of the body are normally paralyzed temporarily			1
" the brain sends out the signals to move , but at the level of the spinal cord , the motor neurons are inhibited , " said dr. @entity69 , a pioneer in the field of sleep research and professor at @entity74			2
but that inhibition fails in @entity10 behavior disorder , allowing the person to move in the way that he or she is envisioning in a dream			1
" it can be very dangerous , " @entity69 said			0
@entity10 behavior disorder and sleepwalking are defined as separate disorders , but in reality there may be some overlap , @entity69 said			1
@entity69 and dr. @entity93 , associate professor at @entity74 medical school , said they have never seen patients who jumped out of windows , but some have punched windows			0
@entity100 appears as himself in " @entity11 , " sitting in the passenger seat beside the struggling comedian while he 's dreaming / listening to @entity69 's audio book in the car			0
( it 's a little reminiscent of @entity108 's cameo in " @entity109 , " another widely known academic in surreal circumstances			0
) " in the simplistic way of thinking , the brain is either awake , sleeping or dreaming , " @entity93 said			0
" but we know that the brain is complicated enough that one part can be awake while another part can be sleeping at the same time			0
" in sleepwalking , the rational part of the brain is offline , while the emotional part is activated , he said			2
most people with @entity10 behavior disorder are men , and they tend to be older , @entity93 said			1
the disorder can mark the start of @entity128			2
it 's unusual for someone as young as @entity18 , 34 , to exhibit @entity10 behavior disorder , @entity93 said			1
but it 's possible that he has a combination of sleepwalking and @entity10 behavior disorder , he said			1
the film portrayed @entity18 's character exhibiting several risk factors : drinking alcohol , staying up late , sleeping in different environments and being under stress			2
sleepwalking by itself is more common , especially among children			2
research suggests that as many as 30 % of children have experienced sleepwalking			1
most people stop once they hit puberty , @entity54 said			0
sleepwalking has occurred among nearly one in three @entity151 at some point in their lives , a study in @entity148 found in may			1
as for whether someone should awaken people who are in one of these altered sleep states , it 's more dangerous for others than for the sleepers , experts say			2
the sleepers ' brains will not be impaired by waking up , but they may react violently			0
sleepwalking among adults is not necessarily a problem			2
for mild cases , education about the phenomenon and reassurance are enough , @entity54 said			2
but if the person goes outside and gets into dangerous situations , he or she may need to sleep more and undergo stress management interventions			1
if that does n't work , especially among people who have been sleepwalking for their whole lives , medications may be necessary			1
the drug that sleepwalkers tend to start with is the anti-anxiety medication clonazepam , @entity54 said			0
it 's not clear why it works , but it may help people relax and sleep more deeply			0
clonazepam is also prescribed for @entity10 behavior disorder , although it is sometimes not appropriate in older patients because it may aggravate sleep apnea , @entity93 said			1
there 's evidence that the hormone melatonin can be effective			0
some people do n't respond to any medications for sleepwalking , @entity54 said			1
it may help to put a bell on the door so that if they try to leave the bedroom , they will wake up -- or at least their bed partner will , he said			0
in extreme cases , people need restraints so that they ca n't get out of bed during the night , @entity54 said -- something that attaches them to the bed in such a way that only someone who is awake could undo it			0
@entity18 has said in interviews that , as with his alter ego in the film , he takes medication and sleeps in a sleeping bag , and he used to wear mittens so that he could n't open the bag			0
@entity54 has n't had any patients who have tried the bag - and - mittens method but noted , " you have to be creative sometimes			0
" experts say there is n't a lot of research going on into sleepwalking or @entity10 behavior disorder treatments since the available resources are sufficient in most people			1
the next step in @entity10 behavior disorder is exploring the connection to parkinson 's disease , @entity93 said			1
it may be possible to identify patients for whom the sleep disorder is a risk factor for @entity128 's and treat them before the disease gets worse			2
