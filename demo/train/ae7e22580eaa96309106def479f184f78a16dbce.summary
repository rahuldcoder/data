-- it all started with some boxes that had not been opened for 80 years			1
" there was a rumor that there were archives in the @entity9 offices in @entity10 that nobody had known about , " says @entity3 , a photography curator			1
" it was difficult to get access , but when i finally got in , they told me that it had all been sold and nothing was left			2
" but then the archivist rolled out these boxes of 2,000 prints			2
it was one of those great ' oh my @entity23 ' moments			2
" among the prints were photographic portraits of @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , and countless other luminaries of the 1920s and 1930s			1
none of the pictures had seen the light of day for eight decades , and all had been taken by the pre-eminent photographer @entity39 ( 1879 - 1973 ) for @entity40 and @entity41			1
also included in the stash were @entity44 - style portraits of women modeling designs by @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 and many others			1
the photographs are now being exhibited at @entity54 's @entity53 , where they will show until 18 january			1
the picasso of photography " it was a kid - in - a - candy - store feeling , " @entity3 recalls			1
" they were taken almost 100 years ago but the pictures felt so contemporary , that 's what really excited me			2
all the poses were so natural , and the vision was so fresh			2
" many of them were fashion pictures , but the women looked like they 'd been born wearing those clothes , that they wore them every day			0
that was @entity39 's skill : he could make people look natural in every sense of the word			1
" during his lifetime , @entity39 was recognized as the most important photographer of his age			1
even today , says @entity79 , an art historian who co-curated the exhibition with @entity3 , he is " one of the top five photographers of all time "			1
" he was the picasso of photography , " she says			0
" he had a 70 - year career covering the whole @entity86			1
all the genres of modern photography are represented in his work , from the pictorial style of the 1900s to the modernist period			0
" at the height of his fame , @entity39 -- who borrowed from a range of aesthetic movements such as @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 to create a distinctive @entity44 style -- was being paid the equivalent of $ 1 million a year by @entity40 and @entity41 , plus another $ 1 million by commercial clients			1
but after his death he fell from prominence because his widow , @entity106 , was extremely protective of the rights to his work , making exhibitions very difficult			0
now , says @entity109 , the third of the exhibition 's co-curators , the time has come to reintroduce @entity39 's work to the world			1
" the skill of any great portrait photographer is to gain an immediacy , an intimacy , " he says			1
" you feel as if @entity39 lives with his subjects			1
he does n't turn them into gods			0
he brings out their humanity			0
" he turned fashion photography into portraiture			0
he looked first and foremost at a woman wearing a dress , not the dress for its own sake			0
that 's what connected so powerfully with the viewers			0
" from steerage to @entity135 the story of how @entity39 came to take these iconic photographs -- and become a household name -- reads like a @entity140 rags - to - riches story			1
in the early 1920s he had gone through an acrimonious divorce , and had large alimony bills that placed him in financial jeopardy			0
he was determined to dedicate his life to his art , and had changed his style to a modernist approach , with clean lines , strong diagonals , and high contrast			0
but he did n't know how to make it pay			0
in a letter to his sister , he wrote that the outlook was bleak and that he was considering abandoning photography for film , which he thought may have a more secure future			0
he traveled from @entity158 , where he had been during the @entity159 , to the @entity160 in steerage , alongside impoverished immigrants			0
after he arrived , he stumbled upon an article in @entity40 in which , to his surprise , he was named as " @entity160 's greatest portrait photographer "			2
he contacted the magazine and was offered a job			0
within a few weeks he was returning to @entity168 to photograph @entity169			0
but this time he was on a big salary , and traveling @entity135			2
" he went from rock bottom to being on top of the world almost overnight , " says @entity109			2
" you can see this reflected in his pictures , which had a sense of exuberance and confidence			0
" how @entity39 worked his magic it was @entity182 himself who had the vision to attract @entity39 's talents to his magazines			1
in their discussions , @entity39 was quite open about the fact that he had no interest in haute - couture			1
but @entity182 persuaded him that " it 's not about fashion , it 's about photography "			0
" those were the days before professional models , " says @entity109			0
" people used to photograph society women			0
but @entity9 went to @entity200 and hired actors and dancers , who knew how to get into character for the camera			1
" this enabled @entity39 to work his magic			1
" it was this unique approach towards fashion photography , which was firmly rooted in the tradition of portraiture , that was one of the keys to @entity39 's success			1
@entity39 lived the high life for several years , photographing the world 's most famous faces			1
but in 1935 he burned out , and resigned to spend his time on horticultural photography , which was his great passion			2
" he really was one of the greats , " says @entity3			0
" he was the founding figure of modernism in photography and the modern woman in fashion photography , as well as modern portraiture			0
" revealing these secret photographs will finally bring him back to the prominence he deserves			2
" the future underground : @entity54 's new spaceship - style tube trains did artists eerily predict the @entity232 crisis ? would you eat @entity235 soup ? the lost art of the @entity160 pin - up			2
