@entity0 is a man with a mission			1
@entity3 is president of the local archeological society in the picturesque hamlet of @entity7 , on @entity10 's @entity9 coast			1
for the past four years he 's also been self - appointed guardian of @entity7 's claim of being home to @entity10 's narrowest alleyway			1
it 's a boast hotly contested by rival villages , but @entity3 is determined to see off all challengers			1
" i 've known it since the day of my birth , " he says			0
" so i started measuring it over and over again , up and down , down and up			0
i 've covered each single point			0
" @entity7 , a jumble of white cobbled streets and bright - colored houses covered in bougainvillea , is already a draw for visitors to @entity10 's @entity30 region			1
there 's a cathedral and a castle , both of which still bear the signs of pirate attacks -- every august a festival and firework display commemorates one raid in 1566			2
and now there 's the alleyway			1
named @entity44 , or " the little street , " it 's said to date back to a @entity47 invasion of 1799			2
' do n't open an umbrella ' " it 's just 41 centimeters ( about 16 inches ) wide but in some parts it shrinks down to 38 , " says @entity3			1
" if you 're a bit overweight and your tummy sticks out like mine then you 'll have to walk sideways to squeeze through			0
oh , and do n't open an umbrella			0
" since making the discovery , @entity3 has made it his life 's work to promote it , traveling across @entity10 with a meter stick in his suitcase to size up rivals			1
" wherever i go i measure each single street just to make sure we 're the winners			0
so far , no one has beaten us			0
at one end of @entity70 lies a tantalizing glimpse of the shimmering blue @entity9			0
within its walls , a lingering smell of urine indicates that perhaps not everyone shares @entity3 's pride in the alleyway			1
" local authorities should take greater care of if , place a sign and some lights			0
it 's one of the city 's jewels , " he adds			2
@entity3 could have a point			1
two other @entity10 towns , @entity88 in the @entity90 region and @entity91 in @entity92 , have made identical claims about the width of their alleyways			1
both use them to lure in tourists , and bitterly dispute rival claims			0
simply called " the alley " , @entity88 's well - kept 43 centimeter - wide passage has for decades drawn crowds of visitors to what a sign proclaims is the narrowest in @entity10			1
' glowing cobblestones ' the town 's mayor grants a faux - medieval certificate to those who succeed in squeezing through " a place where bodies shrink and dreams come true			2
in @entity88 , townsfolk speak about the alley with pride			1
" who cares about the other towns ? " says @entity119 , a waiter at the nearby @entity121 bar			2
" @entity10 's tightest pathway is here			1
" @entity88 , dates to prehistoric ages , is also home to a necropolis and seven museums			1
the strategic clifftop position that once warded off barbarian invaders gives it superb panoramas across the @entity134 mountains			0
@entity135 , a tourism official who is also curator of the local archeological museum , says many visitors come just for the alleyway			2
" so many people have walked through it the cobblestones glow , " she says			0
" many others probably had to give up because of claustrophobia			0
" they contact ahead the museum for guided tours			0
we 've been listed in the @entity147 and we 'll fight till the very end to defend our top attraction			2
" @entity150 dismisses @entity7 's claim , insisting it fails to meet the criteria of a proper alley			1
to qualify , she says , they must have a window or entrance contain a sidewalk and connect two roads			0
bickering neighbors the third contender , the " @entity163 " in the @entity165 town of @entity91 , fits the bill			2
at 45 centimeters wide , it was originally set up to divide the estates of two bickering neighbors			0
according to a sign at its entrance , the romantic name " springs from the inhabitants ' fertile imagination			0
" " it 's so tight you can easily imagine @entity178 ladies and knights passing by , shyly brushing against each other ... gentlemen kissing ladies ' hands , " says @entity174 at the local tourist office			2
the @entity163 pathway opens up to a spellbinding view over local beauty spots including the @entity188 valley and @entity189			0
here too there 's determination to claim the record			0
" we 'll keep on saying that it 's @entity10 's narrowest alley , or at least among its narrowest			1
it 's part of our identity " , says @entity174			0
back in @entity7 , @entity3 is still brandishing his measuring stick			1
" it 's a matter of historical accuracy			2
people must know that @entity7 has the narrowest alley in @entity10			1
it 's a fact " , says @entity3			1
at least until another town claims the record .			0

@entity0 has made it his mission in life to prove his *hometown* of @entity7 has @entity10 's smallest alleyway
he faces strong competition from rivals in the towns of @entity88 and @entity91
for @entity3 it 's a matter of pride . for others a *lucrative* tourist attraction is at stake
