@entity0 -- @entity3 must start serving a 30 - day jail term next week after admitting that she violated her probation on a necklace theft conviction , a @entity0 judge ordered wednesday			1
" it 's possible she could be booked in and booked out " the same day , @entity8 spokesman @entity7 said wednesday afternoon			1
" it depends on the fluctuations of the day , what 's going on in the jail , " @entity7 said			1
after that , the actress must work at least 12 days a month at the county morgue until she completes the 53 remaining days on her court - ordered community service and she must attend 18 psychotherapy sessions , judge @entity14 told her			1
if @entity3 misses any of those goals , she will be returned to jail for another 270 days , the judge ruled			1

the actress , who admitted violating her probation during a hearing wednesday , must report to the @entity0 jail by november 9 , the judge said			2
" you are not to get house arrest or early release , except for that required by the law , " @entity14 said			0
@entity7 said that the early release program is part of the law , meaning @entity3 would likely get out quickly due to overcrowding			0
when @entity14 sentenced @entity3 to 120 days in jail last may , she ended up serving 35 days of home confinement instead , due to jail overcrowding and state rules that give prisoners credit for good behavior			1
it was not immediately clear how many days @entity3 will actually serve this month , if she ends up getting credit for good behavior			1
prosecutors said @entity3 missed 12 of 20 scheduled workdays at a downtown @entity0 women 's center , part of the court - ordered community service imposed in may when she pleaded guilty to stealing a necklace from a @entity62 , @entity63 , jewelry store			2
@entity3 , 25 , was already on probation for two drunken driving convictions from 2007			2
she also canceled 14 of 19 scheduled appointments for court - ordered psychotherapy , they said			0
" from what i see of you , you need a structure , " @entity14 told lohan wednesday , instructing her to return to court each month , starting december 14 , to show she is complying with the schedule			0
if the actress stays on track , her probation would be eased on march 29 , 2012 , @entity14 said			0
if she does n't keep up with the requirements , she will serve the additional 270 days behind bars , the judge said			1
the full sentence imposed wednesday was 150 days for the necklace theft probation violation and 150 days for violating probation on the 2007 drunk driving conviction in @entity86			0
while the original sentence included 360 hours of community service at a downtown @entity0 women 's center , the judge said she did not want to put the @entity92 charity through the pain of @entity3 again			1
when the judge called @entity95 , the charity refused to take @entity3 on as a worker " saying you were a bad example , " @entity14 said			2
but @entity3 seemed to find a good fit with her work at the @entity0 morgue , where deputy chief coroner @entity101 said she worked four days in the past two weeks cleaning up			1
@entity3 reports for morgue duty " so , the morgue is willing to keep you , " the judge said			1
all of her community service work has been transferred there , she said			0
two weeks ago , the actress ' father , @entity107 , told @entity110 's " issues with @entity114 " program that his daughter should n't be in jail , but in rehab			0
last week , @entity107 was arrested twice in two days for violating a court order to stay away from his former girlfriend			0
@entity1 learned wednesday that he is now in an " administrative confinement " cell in the infirmary section of @entity121 jail in @entity122 , @entity123 , where he 's awaiting trial			2
@entity107 arrested @entity3 's legal woes , which began four years ago with two drunk driving arrests , have been compounded by her failure to attend counseling classes , and alcohol and drug test failures			2
her probation is scheduled to end within a year unless @entity3 breaks any laws before then			0
it has been extended several times because of violations , including the failed alcohol and drug tests			0
" it 's possible she could be booked in and booked out " the same day			0
" @entity1 's @entity141 contributed to this report .			0

if she violates probation again , she must serve another 270 days in jail
the judge said she can not be released on home confinement
