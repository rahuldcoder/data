-- some folks in @entity2 think it would be a good idea if they tore down what has been called the " @entity5 " and replaced it with a park			0
the @entity8 , which opened in april 1965 as an engineering marvel , has n't had a tenant since 2003 when the @entity11 moved to a new stadium next door			1
( the @entity14 scooted away after the 1999 season )			0
last year , @entity17 residents said they were n't going to spring for a property tax increase that would have helped pay to turn the now - dilapidated dome into a spiffy , green convention center			1
25 years on the ' dead stadium ' tour so @entity11 and the @entity24 , who also play at @entity26 , asked two firms to come up with some potential uses of the land			1
one is a $ 66 million greenspace that , if they got started soon , could be ready in time for the @entity32			2
the site would feature columns on which great moments or players or entertainers would be remembered			2
" although the option does include removal of the @entity8 building itself , it pays homage to the history , heritage and culture of the @entity47 , " the rodeo said on its website			1
" the plan is constructed so that anyone who visits the space will have the ability to learn about the relevant events held in the @entity47 and about its unique history			0
" @entity54 100 years later @entity55 , a spokesperson for @entity57 judge @entity56 , said this does n't mean the @entity8 is coming down any time soon			1
" anybody and their brother can make a proposal , " @entity55 said			0
" this is not a county proposal			0
this is coming from tenant @entity66			0
the county does not have a proposal pending nor is there a timetable			0
" on @entity73 , he said that only the commissioners will decide the fate of the first domed sports stadium in the world			1
and he said the judge does n't want the dome knocked down .			2

the @entity8 opened in 1965 but has n't had a tenant since 2003
the world *'s* first sports dome is next to the stadium where the @entity24 play
*architects* drew up plans for a greenspace on the site where fans could *gather*
@entity57 *welcomes* the plan , but *official* says they will make final decision
