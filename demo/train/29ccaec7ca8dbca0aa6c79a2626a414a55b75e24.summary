-- @entity3 leaders have voted to allow women to become bishops , the church announced monday			1
the measure required a two - thirds majority in all three voting bodies of the church : the @entity9 , the @entity10 and the @entity10			1
the legislation was passed at the church 's @entity12 , the three - times - a - year meeting that sets policies for the church , which is being held in the city of @entity17			2
the first female bishop could be appointed by the end of the year , the church said			1
the head of the @entity3 , archbishop of canterbury @entity21 , said he was " delighted " with the result			2
" today marks the start of a great adventure of seeking mutual flourishing while still , in some cases disagreeing , " he said in a statement			0
" the challenge for us will be for the church to model good disagreement and to continue to demonstrate love for those who disagree on theological grounds			0
" the measure is subject to approval by @entity39 's @entity38			0
this is seen as a legal formality			0
the @entity3 first began ordaining women as priests in 1994 and has been debating whether they should become bishops since 2005			1
" to those who ask ' what took you so long ? ' my answer is that every decision has a cost and there will be those within our body who will be hurting as a result of this decision , the archbishop of @entity17 , @entity45 , said			0
" our answer to the hurting should not be ' @entity60 ' but rather ' we will not let go until you have blessed us			0
' " we move slowly because we move together			0
but in moving together we achieve not only what is just but also model what is right			0
" the rev. @entity64 tweeted that she told her 8 - year - old niece that she can be a bishop now			2
the niece said she did n't want to be a bishop			0
" yes but you can , " @entity64 tweeted , who earlier called the decision " wonderful news			1
" two lay members of the church told the @entity74 that they were upset with the vote			0
@entity76 told the network there is " not going to be a smooth road ahead , " and @entity78 said the decision fails 25 % of those in the church who do n't believe women should be bishops			1
previous votes at its @entity12 meeting in 2012 , draft legislation that would have allowed women to become bishops failed by six votes to get a two - thirds majority in the @entity10			1
in 2010 , the church 's governing body narrowly rejected a measure , aimed at satisfying conservatives , that would have allowed parishes that opposed women bishops to have an additional male bishop			1
the @entity3 is the largest church of the @entity98 , with more than 26 million baptized members			1
the communion represents more than 85 million people in 165 countries , including the @entity104 @entity103			0
the @entity105 lists church districts that already have serving women bishops as @entity108 and @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , the @entity103 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115			1
the @entity3 broke from the @entity116 in the 16th century during the @entity117 , which saw the establishment of protestant churches			2
on its website , the @entity3 says it " consciously retained a large amount of continuity with the @entity3 of the @entity125 and @entity126 periods in terms of its use of the catholic creeds , its pattern of ministry , its buildings and aspects of its liturgy , but which also embodied @entity119 insights in its theology and in the overall shape of its liturgical practice			2
