-- it was merely a dream , was n't it ? that whole @entity4 thing of six months ago -- never happened , right ? the headline news of his becoming the first openly gay active male professional athlete in a team sport			1
the supportive tweets from everyone ranging from @entity13 and @entity14 to @entity15 and @entity16			0
the raves ( " game - changing ! " )			2
remember when @entity21 newspaper called @entity4 ' emergence significant for @entity24 acceptance ... " as professional sports had long been seen as the final frontier " ? remember when the @entity27 presented @entity4 with its courage award ? remember when the veteran @entity30 center was being likened to @entity31 ? well , eh , forget it			1
as you read this , @entity4 is likely sitting somewhere inside his @entity37 home , twiddling his thumbs , watching reality tv , waiting , hoping , waiting , hoping , waiting , hoping for the groundbreaking opportunity that looks , increasingly , unlikely to occur			1
put differently : for one to actually become the first openly gay active male professional athlete in a team sport , one must be an openly gay active male professional athlete playing a team sport			0
and @entity4 ai n't playing squat			1
with the @entity30 opening in less than two weeks , it has become clear that the league 's 30 teams have no interest in @entity4 , a 34 - year - old journeyman			1
from a purely basketball standpoint , this is understandable : once a valuable role player on a @entity54 team that reached back to back @entity56 series in the early 2000s , @entity4 is a shell of his former self			1
playing with @entity60 and @entity61 last season , he averaged but 1.1 points and 1.6 rebounds in 38 games			0
he is -- to be blunt -- a slow , nonathletic player with creaky joints and no offensive repertoire of which to speak			2
were this any other similarly submediocre player in any other sport , his departure would register nary a blip on the radar			2
he would vanish , and life would move on			0
@entity4 , however , ceased being ordinary the moment he announced he was gay			1
to thousands upon thousands of @entity75 , he became a beacon of hope and a sign that maybe sexuality would matter not the in machismo - stuffed world of professional sports			0
if @entity16 and @entity87 and @entity88 could embrace a gay man as a teammate , what excuse would the loudmouth , homophobic blockhead at the construction site or law firm have for his close - mindedness ? finally , things were about to change			0
only they were n't because , well , nobody called			0
the @entity30 has been repeatedly defended in its inaction with predictable attacks on @entity4 ' game -- too slow , too marginal , too worthless			1
yet could somebody ( anybody ? ) have at least invited him to training camp -- land of myriad oafs and fringe players itching to land a job ? hell , the @entity105 ' preseason roster included @entity106 and @entity107 , two men with limited skill sets and without @entity4 ' great teammate / dogged worker resume			1
hell , the @entity112 briefly employed @entity113 , a 6 - foot - 6 shooting guard with no redeeming @entity30 attributes			1
hell , the @entity117 , according to @entity119 ' @entity118 , " have basically worked out everyone who has ever touched a basketball this offseason			0
this is n't a hard one to figure out			0
as the late @entity121 of baseball fame repeatedly pointed out , change within the sports landscape does n't come easily			0
just as members of the @entity126 were loathe to share locker space with @entity31 in the summer of 1947 , many @entity30 players ( whether they admit it publicly or not ) were likely not thrilled by the idea of showering alongside a gay man even if they 'd been showering alongside said gay man for more than a decade			1
adding @entity4 to a roster -- even a preseason roster -- would likely have meant awkwardness , confusion and weirdness			2
there almost inevitably would have been conservative @entity139 teammates asking to change in a designated private space			0
special press conferences would need to be arranged			0
gay rights groups would flock to the arena -- and they 'd be loud			0
and what of the slurs that fly across courts during practice with staggering regularity , and without much thought ? what would happen the first time a @entity151 or @entity152 or @entity153 uttered the word " f * * * * t , " even if it were not directed at @entity4 ? could all this trouble ( and it would , inevitably , be trouble ) be worth it for at best a seldom - used 12th man ? answer : absolutely			2
opportunities like this do n't happen often , and the @entity30 -- arguably the most progressive of the four major @entity75 team sports -- is failing miserably			2
where is @entity15 , the @entity54 ' new coach and former @entity4 ' teammate , with a camp invite ? where is @entity166 , the forward - thinking @entity167 owner , with a pen and a contract ? where are the @entity171 , the team whose arena is 18 miles from the spot where @entity175 was murdered ? where are the @entity105 , a franchise desperately in need in grit and toughness ? where are the @entity181 , whose bench could use a bruiser of @entity4 ' ilk ? how in the world could no one think to add @entity4 to a roster , if only to give his courageous first step the conclusion it deserves ? how are we letting this one slip away ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			1

@entity195 : @entity30 player @entity4 came out in april and his move drew support
@entity4 has yet to be signed ; where did all that support go ?
he grants @entity4 ' game is off , but lesser players have been invited to training camp
@entity195 : @entity30 missing chance to give @entity4 ' courageous move the conclusion it deserves
