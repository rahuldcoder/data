it has become synonymous with the glamor and excess of the late seventies			1
but people who 've retained clear memories of @entity7 , the legendary @entity9 nightclub that defined an era , are few and far between			1
@entity11 , the @entity12 photographer , is one of these			1
and not only can he remember the club -- he has a collection of stunning pictures to prove it			1
now those pictures are being released in a new book , " @entity7 "			1
the first edition has already sold out ; a second " silver edition " will be available on 23 december			2
" like so many good things , my involvement with @entity7 was a fluke , " @entity11 tells @entity1 over the telephone from @entity9			1
" my girlfriend at the time was a photographer , and had access to @entity7			1
" they asked me if i would be interested in photographing there , and who would turn that down ? i was very lucky , and took advantage of it			2
" watch : @entity9 in the @entity4 the coolest place on earth in the @entity4 , @entity7 was probably the coolest place on @entity35			1
it was started by the socialites and entrepreneurs @entity38 and @entity39 , and was located at 254 west 54th street in @entity40			2
the building had originally been a theater , which made for an impressive party space			2
and when the @entity47 raided the premises a month after it opened for selling unlicensed alcohol , its reputation for glamor only increased			2
regular visitors included @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			1
to name but a few			2
" the place was like nothing i 'd ever seen before , " @entity11 recalls			2
" it was an extraordinary situation , and i knew it would n't ever be repeated , even moment by moment			2
" people around me were going crazy , basically , and i was trying to be passionate but remain cool enough to take pictures that would be clear and compelling			1
" watch : ' @entity70 is a magical place ' a magical moment in history the intensity of the place , @entity11 says , had something to do with the fact that everybody recognized that they were experiencing a brief moment of magic			2
after all , in its original form it was only open for four years , from 1977 to 1981 ( at the closing party , @entity84 performed to an audience that included @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 )			1
" there was a communal recognition that this was thrilling , remarkable , unique , " @entity11 says			2
" they all recognized it			2
the dancers were dancing wildly , the celebrities were going into the secret rooms for cocaine or sex , and the general feeling was charged with the kind of electricity that you could never find anywhere else			1
" on one occasion , at a @entity106 , four tons of glitter were dumped from the ceiling , forming a four - inch layer all over the floor			2
the owner , @entity39 , compared it to " standing on stardust " , though guests complained that the glitter did not leave their clothes for months			0
" it sort of pooled on the balcony , and got into everybody 's eyes , " @entity11 recalls			0
" but i was so concentrated on what i was creating that i had a sort of force field that resisted the glitter			0
" on another occasion , a net holding gift boxes full of goodies from fashion houses was released above the crowd			1
the power of music " to me , it was partly the music that set the scene , " says @entity11 , " that throbbing disco beat			0
partly it was the architecture of the place , it had very high ceilings and a special geometry			0
but mostly it was the people -- there were a lot of very beautiful and well - dressed people , particularly the women			0
" indeed , @entity7 was one of the most inaccessible nightclubs in the world			1
according to @entity11 , the owners wanted a " salad " of people in the club , comprising a mixture of the rich , famous , young and beautiful			1
the doormen were charged with creating this combination , and they subjected every aspiring clubber to rigorous scrutiny			0
according to @entity11 , this was a " drawn out and difficult " process			0
" people would wait outside for hours , " he says , " waiting to be judged			0
the main doorman was @entity158 , who is now a radio presenter			0
these days he 's a very handsome middle - aged man , but back then he was a beautiful young man			0
by some standards only known by him and the other doormen , it was decided who would get into the club			1
" once inside , however , everybody was equal			0
as @entity52 famously said : " the key of the success of @entity7 is that it 's a dictatorship at the door and a democracy on the dance floor			1
" poignant memories although some of @entity11 's pictures had been exhibited in the past , they had never been gathered together in a single collection			0
two years ago , he went into his archive , pulled out his " yellow @entity179 boxes " of prints and negatives , and started the process of bringing @entity7 back to life			1
" with the intervention of the decades , i was seeing the pictures again with different eyes , and they were actually better than i remembered , " he says			0
" i think they look incredible			0
having let them sit there for 35 years , i 've earned the right to be enthusiastic about them again			0
to me , they hold up very well			0
" remembering the glory days of @entity7 is not without its poignancy			1
the club represented the final moments of a @entity196 world , and the dawn of a new , more cynical age			1
" it was a terrible transition marker , " says @entity11			0
" it was like the last gasp of the @entity202 going down , in a way			0
the owners were charged with tax evasion , and i the summer of 1981 there was a long article in the @entity208 about this mysterious illness affecting the gay community in @entity9			1
" a good percentage of the people in those pictures later died of @entity214			0
it was n't a more innocent time -- you could hardly call it innocent			0
but it was an unreflective , out - of - control , wonderful , stampeding time			0
it will never happen again			0
" unseen photos of @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and others lethal beauty in the @entity227 : @entity229 's rare bejeweled show guns the lost art of the @entity12 pin - up			1
