-- by the end of last week , congressional @entity1 and a few moderate @entity2 succeeded in requiring most employers to include contraception as part of health insurance coverage , in spite of deep opposition from the @entity2 majority			2
across the @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity1 and , again , a few @entity2 moderates were able to soften or kill @entity2 bills that would have put into place humiliating obstacles to abortion			2
thousands of ordinary women across the country have been writing letters , sending e-mails , leaving phone messages , and buttonholing state and national lawmakers in support of cheaper contraceptive methods and greater access to abortion			1
though they did n't get everything they want , many are , i suspect , thankful for the partial victories so far			1
but i have to ask -- where in these recent debates are the voices of ordinary men ? why are n't we hearing publicly even now from husbands who are not ready to have children they would have to support ? or from boyfriends who do not have the means to support a child ? why do n't we hear more from fathers who are working two jobs so that their daughters can attend college and , if they wish , start on a career unencumbered by child - raising responsibilities ? other than female - friendly lawmakers and a handful of tv news / comedians , older men have been curiously slow to publicly support women 's reproductive freedom			1
do they really want their sons and daughters to have to take a second or third job in order to pay the costs of raising an unplanned child , or have to decide whether to risk an abortion ? the truth is , many men of the baby boom generation would prefer not to talk about pregnancy			1
fetuses are not exactly what they chat about with the mechanic who 's fixing their car			2
for baby boomer women , on the other hand , the ability to control when or if you have a baby is nothing short of a miracle			1
we remember , as if it were yesterday , when the pill became available and the diaphragm was improved			2
we happily took charge of preventing pregnancy or resolving an unplanned pregnancy			0
and as a friend of mine remembers , it never occurred to us to talk to the men in our lives about contraception			1
as i 've gotten older , i 've realized there were consequences of not including male partners early in such discussions			0
at my college reunion a couple of years ago , a former male classmate confessed privately that when we were students , his girlfriend , also a student , had gotten pregnant twice			0
both times , she had traveled hundreds of miles to @entity103 , at that time one of a few states where abortion was legal			0
" were n't either of you using birth control ? " i asked him			1
he muttered something that sounded like " no , " his eyes staring at some point over my shoulder			0
had he accompanied her to @entity115 ? he looked surprised by the question , and then shook his head			0
he had the good sense not to appear cavalier about it all			0
but it was clear that he had never thought of birth control or abortion as a guy thing			1
i suspect his girlfriend had n't either			2
could such cluelessness or discomfort help explain -- though by no means exonerate -- the silence of men of a certain age when male lawmakers introduce downright abusive bills relating to female reproduction ? i strongly suspect that conservative lawmakers will continue to attempt to control a conversation that many of us thought had been settled , and they have the money and party support to get re-elected			1
when i read how @entity140 and other states are passing bills that , in the words of columnist @entity146 , " are treating women in ways that are patronizing and humiliating , " i despair			2
then i remember that many of these legislators are part of a generation that is moving off the stage of public life			0
i have hope that the generation that succeeds them will be different			0
men in their 20s and early 30s had more sex education in school than their fathers did , often in coed classes			2
they are more involved in sexual decision - making with their partners than previous generations			2
polls show that the majority of them , like the majority of young women , support contraception and legalized abortion			1
i recently talked to one woman in her early 20s who said her boyfriend keeps up with advances in birth control as much as she does			1
their decision about which method to use is always made together , she said			0
another young woman said she and her partner debated methods for more than a year , sometimes heatedly			0
they recently married , and she is happily pregnant			0
a young man told me that in the beginning of his current relationship , he and his girlfriend split the cost of her birth control pills			1
when he cut back on his hours at work in order to start graduate school , his girlfriend picked up his share because she was earning more money than he was			0
once he 's earning more money again , he 'll resume paying part of the tab			0
it 's only fair , he said , adding , " women may have to give up a little control , but men can share the burden			1

@entity210 : as lawmakers try to *restrict* birth control , little is heard from men who support it
@entity208 says thousands of women have *protested* plans , but men are n't coming *forward*
@entity208 asks : where in this debate are the husbands and boyfriends not ready for kids ?
baby boom men were clueless about birth control , @entity208 says , but younger men are involved
