@entity0 -- after accusations that several insurers have underpaid families of those killed in action , one company is considering changing how it allocates death benefit payments , @entity3 vice chairman @entity2 told @entity1			1
@entity3 may give families the option of accepting a direct lump - sum check , @entity2 said			1
@entity0 attorney general @entity14 launched a fraud investigation into the life insurance industry for " practices that appear to have denied grieving military families and others of millions in life - insurance cash , " @entity14 's office announced thursday			1
the attorney general 's office probed the industry the day after the finance publication @entity23 reported the insurance companies potentially exploited fallen soldier 's families			1
@entity23 said some insurers tell families of fallen military personnel that policy payouts will be placed in an interest - bearing account			1
but the bulk of the interest benefits the insurers , and the cash is not placed in banks insured by the @entity37 ( @entity37 )			1
insurers place cash in their corporate accounts , reportedly earning up to 4.8 percent interest while paying families as little as 0.5 percent interest , @entity23 reported			1
" it is shocking and just plain wrong for these multinational life insurance companies to pocket hundreds of millions in profits that really belong to those who have lost family members and have already suffered immensely , " @entity14 said			1
currently , @entity3 , which met with officials at the @entity50 , gives a family several payment options , including setting up a " lump sum " that , rather than sending a check to the surviving family , sets up an " @entity56 " within @entity3			1
the money stays in @entity3 's hands , which , paying only .5 percent interest to the family , can invest at large profits , @entity14 said			1
@entity14 's office said holders of @entity61 receive what appears to be a checkbook with " @entity64 " on the " checks , " but said the so - called checks can not be used to make purchases and are not bank checks at all			1
" instead , @entity3 must send money to @entity64 before the checks can clear , " the attorney general 's office said			2
" @entity3 beneficiaries are also not informed that , under a 2008 law , they have one year to place the death benefits in a @entity74 and earn tax - free investment gains for the rest of their lives			1
thus , real financial harm is suffered by @entity3 's lack of disclosure			2
" @entity3 says the @entity61 provide a secure , conservative option for survivors			2
beneficiaries who find a better interest rate can move the money at any time , it says			0
subpoenas have been served on eight insurance companies -- @entity3 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , and the @entity97 -- though the entire life insurance industry is under investigation , according to the attorney general 's office			1
the accounts in question include @entity3 's @entity56 and @entity91 's @entity103			1
@entity104 , senior vice president and chief economist at the @entity106 , says the banks are doing nothing out of the ordinary			2
" it 's completely premature , blown way out of proportion			0
what the industry does , what insurance companies do in these cases is exactly what beneficiaries need , " @entity104 said			1
" the opportunity to put off making decisions about the use of large amounts of money without suffering any financial loss			0
that 's exactly what this product , this arrangement does			0
i do n't know why the @entity14 organization would attack it the way they have			2
" in a written statement , @entity3 chairman and ceo @entity133 said , " it is important that the beneficiaries of our fallen service men and women are treated with dignity and respect during a very difficult time			2
given the questions raised over the life insurance program we administer for the @entity146 , we welcome an opportunity to address the concerns and to set the record straight			0
" @entity3 said that while the accounts in question are not @entity37 insured , the accounts are protected by state guaranty funds that provide protection of at least $ 250,000 in most states			2
" @entity3 does not in any way take money from beneficiaries , " the company said			0
in a written statement , @entity91 spokesman @entity160 said thursday he has not seen @entity14 's subpoena and therefore had no comment on it			2
" however we strongly disagree with many misleading statements in recent media reports and want to be clear regarding several important features of @entity91 's @entity103 ( ' @entity103 ' ) , " @entity160 said			0
he said @entity91 is not the issuer of the @entity169 provided to members of the armed forces , but the company does provide life insurance policies for civilian federal employees under a program called @entity176			0
" our materials carefully explain the @entity103 to our customers so that they understand that they can use their checkbooks to withdraw all of their benefits immediately or over time as they choose , " @entity160 said			0
" they have full access to their funds and earn a guaranteed minimum interest rate that exceeds what they could earn on most money market accounts			0
" @entity3 said more than 40,000 @entity56 drafts cleared last year , and the company receives few complaints from beneficiaries about difficulties			0
secretary of defense @entity196 said he learned thursday that families of deceased military members did not get a lump - sum payment for life insurance policies			1
" until today , i actually believed that the families of our fallen heroes got a check for the full amount of their benefit , " @entity196 said during a briefing at the @entity202			0
" so this came as news to me			0
and so i will just say i will be very interested in the outcome of " an investigation			0
the @entity50 said it is conducting " a full investigation " to make sure survivors are fully protected and being treated with care and respect			0
" the possibility that life insurance companies may be profiting inappropriately from these service members ' sacrifice is completely unacceptable , " the @entity50 said in a statement			1
" @entity50 is deeply concerned that military and veteran families may potentially be harmed in some way by the use of the @entity226			0
" at the conclusion of the investigation , the @entity50 said , the agency will determine whether to continue use of the @entity56 program			0
the va also will contact the approximately 10,000 survivors to remind them of their options under the @entity169 program .			0
