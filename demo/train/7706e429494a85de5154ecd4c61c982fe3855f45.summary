-- in my travels around the world i have noted how attitudes toward women are a pretty accurate weather vane indicating what is happening in the wider politics of a country			1
in visits to @entity11 in the past three years i saw rising anxiety about razor - sharp divisions between the secular and those who want a society where women " breed " for their country and wear the hijab			1
in may , @entity22 women 's rights activist @entity20 e-mailed me from @entity23 , " things are fast going down the plughole , it 's pretty depressing			1
the @entity27 twist is becoming suffocating with how the prime minister keeps trying to cajole women to stay home and have three to five children			1
they are offering early retirement to women for having upwards of three kids			2
. ! ! divorce is frowned upon			0
abortion is all but banned			0
i am afraid darker days are yet to come			0
" her predictions were prescient			0
the divisions have now cracked wide open			2
a peaceful protest by @entity43 against plans to chop down ancient trees and transform the city 's largest public park , @entity48 , into a large shopping mall has erupted into a far wider protest			1
@entity52 reports say the unrest has spread to 60 cities and towns across @entity11 , including the political capital @entity57 and popular tourism centers of @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			1
is @entity11 's @entity63 moment ? on saturday i received an e-mail with an eyewitness account from a women 's organization with offices in the heart of @entity23			1
it read : " three days ago at midnight bulldozers charged into @entity48 , home to century - old trees			1
concerned citizens quickly shared this information on @entity75 , @entity76 ( # direngezipark , # occupygezi ) , @entity77 , and other social media , and numerous other people joined them to stop the destruction			0
from then on , protesters have been occupying @entity48 day and night , despite being attacked by police forces with pepper gas and high - pressure water jets			1
" opinion : why @entity11 's protests are no @entity87 @entity22 prime minister @entity88 has for some time been alienating his liberal supporters			1
he seems out of touch			2
last year , he characterized abortions and even cesarean sections as " secret plots " to hinder the country 's growth			0
in january , @entity88 called on @entity22 women to have " at least four or five children " in the name of the country 's " grandeur " and faster economic growth			1
he assigned four government ministers to work on population policy and proposals for family expansion			0
the prime minister 's @entity106 has its roots in political islam , but @entity88 insists he is committed to @entity11 's secular state			1
the protesters , unconvinced by his claim , are waving flags emblazoned with photographs of past president @entity115 , who , beginning in 1923 , began @entity11 's transition from @entity117 into modern , @entity119 - style secular state with a program of political , economic and cultural reform			1
thousands of new schools were built , and primary education was made free and compulsory			0
@entity125 's message to the @entity126 in @entity23 was : " the exercise of civil and political rights by women is a necessity for the happiness and prestige of humankind			2
" the @entity22 media appear slow to respond to the events of the past few days			0
@entity20 e-mailed me on monday : " ...			0
total black - out of @entity22 media			0
... we are quite speechless			0
... never seen the media of any country remain soooo silent while a mini revolution was raging all around			0
... a supposed democratic country that is ! ! " after winning three elections , @entity88 has grown overconfident			2
many complain about his increasing authoritarianism			0
he is scheduled to leave @entity11 this week for a four - day visit to @entity148			1
some hope he wo n't return and will step down so things wo n't escalate			0
@entity88 has been in power since 2002			2
his electoral success was mainly due to the economy ; @entity11 is the sixth biggest economy in @entity155			1
the decade of rule of @entity88 's @entity106 has coincided with a time of prosperity			1
per - capita income has tripled , exports have increased nearly tenfold and @entity22 banks are in good health			2
the opposition parties ( save the @entity165 ) have until now been weak and divided			0
the challenge to both the protesters and the government is to achieve change through the ballot box , not though police brutality nor the bullet			0
the @entity22 government 's future policies toward women will be an indicator of the future direction the country will take			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

@entity181 : treatment of women a good weather vane for wider state of politics in @entity11
she says @entity88 says women should *reproduce* more ; he says he 's secular , does n't sound it
she says @entity48 tumult shows divisions between secular and hinted - at @entity27 state
@entity181 : @entity88 had success leading thriving nation , now out of touch , *over-confident*
