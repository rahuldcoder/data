-- @entity2 's 700 million smartphone users will no longer be able to share stories about politics without official approval , according to new regulations announced by authorities on thursday , which took immediate effect			1
the @entity10 released a 10 - point document detailing new rules for instant messaging ( @entity15 ) service providers and users			1
it is the latest move in an official campaign to " clean up the online environment and rein in rumormongers , " according to @entity2 media			1
although the rules apply to all @entity15 service providers , they are widely seen as targeting @entity25 , the immensely popular mobile app that allows people to share text , videos , photos and audio recording with multiple users at once			1
public accounts on any mobile @entity15 platform will also need to register with authorities using the real names of the owners			1
there are 5.8 million public accounts in @entity2 on subscription - based mobile apps , including celebrities , businesses and other organizations , according to state media @entity43			1
the rules also stipulate that , while the accounts of professional news providers are allowed to post about politics , all other accounts must obtain prior approval from authorities to post -- or repost -- political news			2
dominating the digital " this is just the latest set of rules to remind everyone who 's in charge and provide yet another legal and verbal framework for silencing troublesome voices , " says @entity54 , commentator on @entity55 and founder of @entity57			1
a similar set of regulations was imposed on users of @entity68 two years ago , the micro-blogging platform commonly referred to as @entity2 's @entity69			1
prominent @entity68 users were later detained or prosecuted , on charges both related and unrelated to their online activities			0
lately , " rumor mongers " have become the target of the official online clean - up			0
in april , @entity76 , who goes by " @entity78 " online , was sentenced to two years in prison for spreading false information on @entity68			0
" after the takedown of the @entity82 ( verified accounts with huge follower numbers ) on @entity68 last year , i more or less gave up posting anything to the @entity55 , " says @entity54			0
" the government has successfully brought @entity68 under control and has become the dominant voice there			2
i have no doubt that they will succeed with @entity25 , " he adds			0
another user of a popular @entity25 account on current affairs said that the new regulation " will definitely impact what i 'm going to post in the future			0
" it 's quite obvious now , other public accounts are definitely going to be more cautious about republishing political news because no one knows how strongly the rules will be enforced			2
and the term ' political news ' is not quite clearly defined			0
we 'll wait to see how things go			0
" a balancing act to many @entity2 watchers , the new regulations that target mobile use has come as no surprise			1
the three - year - old @entity25 , owned by @entity114 holdings , is unlike any other mobile app. it has taken @entity2 by storm , with a monthly average of 398.5 million users who rely on the app to get all sorts of things done -- from booking taxis to sending virtual hongbao ( customary gift money )			1
it also extends into e-commerce , gaming , socializing and posting pictures			0
" @entity25 has turned into the extended operating system of @entity2 's mobile millions , " said @entity0 's @entity128 , a technology enthusiast and host of " on @entity2			1
" a @entity114 spokesperson said that it " respects related government policies in all markets " where the company operates			0
" and @entity114 always devotes to create a healthy and secure online environment for our users			0
we 'll take measures against offensive and abusive activities to show compliance with relevant regulations			0
we welcome users to report such instance to us via online channel			0
" staying in the race with its seamless functions , the @entity2 - developed app is fast gaining ground on its @entity153 rivals , such as @entity154			2
but now that the government is showing an ironclad crackdown on smartphone app freedoms , how can @entity2 mobile developers stay competitive on the global stage ? " this is @entity161 's dilemma			1
the government wants to develop the @entity55 to drive innovation and economic growth , while keeping tabs on any potential political risk bubbling up online , " says @entity128			2
@entity167 's @entity54 does n't feel that increased government regulation will have any lasting impact on innovation			1
" the social media and news aspect of @entity25 is trivial compared to @entity25 's personal messaging function that is replacing @entity181 text messages , its taxi booking and payment system , and wealth management product , and the @entity25 - enabled use of qr codes for marketing			2
this is a highly innovative fusion of a variety of different digital services , and it 's beautifully engineered			2
" of course the intellectual repression caused by @entity2 's censorious media , telecom and education systems does hinder innovation , but it does not destroy it			1
" he adds that he sees workarounds to the regulations should users want to disseminate subversive materials : " the point of the rules is not to delete every single vaguely problematic posting , but rather to stop public opinion from being swayed by non-official voices on the @entity55			0
" @entity0 's @entity200 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 issues new rules for uses and providers of mobile @entity15 services
commentator : " this is just the latest set of rules to remind everyone who 's in charge "
will the increased control of mobile use hamper mobile innovation in @entity2 ?
