-- @entity2 president @entity1 has been cleared of any misconduct by an internal investigation into the bribery scandal that threatened to drag football 's world governing body into terminal crisis			1
but his predecessor , @entity10 @entity9 , has now resigned as @entity2 's honorary president for his part in the scandal			1
@entity9 and former executive committee members @entity15 and dr. @entity16 were all found to have accepted illegal payments from @entity2 's former marketing partner @entity19 ( @entity19 )			1
the payments were made between 1992 and may 2000 -- @entity19 went bankrupt the following year			2
@entity2 's @entity21 -- set up by @entity1 after the corruption scandal was investigated by the @entity24 authorities last year -- said it would not take any further action , adding the case was now closed			1
the findings of the committee have been published in detail , following @entity1 's re-election promise in 2011 to make @entity2 's workings more transparent			1
@entity1 , who took over the presidency of @entity2 from @entity9 in 1998 , welcomed the report , saying in a statement : " i have taken note of the report from the chairman of the @entity38 , @entity39 , regarding the examination of the @entity19 case			1
" i note in particular that , in his conclusions , chairman @entity39 states that ' the @entity19 case is concluded for the @entity21 ' and that ' no further proceedings related to the @entity19 matter are warranted against any other football official			0
' " i also note with satisfaction that this report confirms that ' president @entity1 's conduct could not be classified in any way as misconduct with regard to any ethics rules			1
' " i have no doubt that @entity2 , thanks to the governance reform process that i proposed , now has the mechanisms and means to ensure that such an issue -- which has caused untold damage to the reputation of our institution -- does not happen again			0
" @entity9 , who turns 97 next month , was one of the most recognizable figures in sports administration , serving as @entity2 president for 24 years from 1974 and doing much to make football a truly global game			1
prior to @entity2 , he served as president of the @entity68 from 1958 to 1973 and was also on the @entity69 , until his resignation -- because of his links with the @entity2 scandal -- in 2011			0
a report by a @entity24 court last year found that @entity9 had received at least 1.5 million @entity24 francs ( $ 1.53 million ) and @entity15 was paid at least chf 12.4 million ( $ 12.64 million ) from @entity19 , who then owned the tv rights to the @entity77			0
" the acceptance of bribe money by @entity9 , @entity15 and @entity16 was not punishable under @entity24 criminal law at that time , " explained @entity39 in his report into the @entity2 - @entity19 case			2
" i agree with that determination			0
however , it is clear that @entity9 and @entity15 , as football officials , should not have accepted any bribe money , and should have had to pay it back since the money was in connection with the exploitation of media rights			0
" this does not change anything with regard to the morally and ethically reproachable conduct of both persons			0
" i note that mr. @entity9 resigned from his position as honorary president effective from april 18 2013 and that dr. @entity16 resigned from his positions as a @entity101 member , as a @entity2 standing committee member and as @entity103 ( the governing body for @entity105 ) president effective from april 24 2013			1
hence , any further steps or suggestions are superfluous			0
" no further proceedings related to the @entity19 matter are warranted against any other football official			0
" @entity15 -- @entity9 's former son - in - law -- had already stood down from @entity2 last year , shortly after resigning as president of the @entity113			2
@entity1 claimed in 2012 that he did know about alleged bribe payments made to former @entity2 executives , but insisted he did n't think they were illegal			0
at that time @entity1 was working as @entity2 's secretary general			2
the report by @entity2 's @entity21 again cleared the 77 - year - old of any direct culpability but still raised question marks over his behavior			1
" it must be questioned , however , whether president @entity1 knew or should have known over the years before the bankruptcy of @entity19 that @entity19 had made payments ( bribes ) to other @entity2 officials , " the report stated			1
" president @entity1 stated during his interview with mr @entity130 that he ' could n't understand that somebody is sending money to @entity2 for another person , ' but at that time he did not suspect the payment was a commission ( bribe )			2
" president @entity1 's conduct could not be classified in any way as misconduct with regard to any ethics rules			2
the conduct of president @entity1 may have been clumsy			0
" the report from the @entity21 , which was established on guidance from the @entity24 court and is led by @entity144 attorney @entity130 , effectively draws a line under the scandal that first emerged at the end of 2010 .			0
