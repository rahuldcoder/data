@entity0 , @entity1 -- picture the monumental task of counseling strangers affected by a horror worse than they 've ever imagined			1
now , imagine spending an entire career doing that , year after year			2
regularly exposed to the aftermath of deadly attacks and natural disasters , grief counselors face the fury of @entity13 and the worst of humanity -- while leading the effort to counteract it with the best			1
those who sign up for disaster counseling require a demeanor , depth and inner - strength to keep going , experts say			1
" our job is to provide psychological first aid and to help people find their strengths , " says @entity21 , a psychologist who has been handling calls and walk - ins at a hotline center here in @entity0 , @entity1 , since friday 's massacre at a midnight showing of the new @entity33 film " @entity34			1
" remembering the victims " in this type of shooting disaster , the unexpectedness of it is a big part of the difficulty for unsettling families , because they want to know why			1
and we know after we 've done this for a while that there often is n't an answer as to why			1
so you 're trying to help people move past that without being able to know , " she said			2
the center and its partners spoke with about 200 people within 24 hours of the shootings , and more have been coming in since			2
many are locals who knew victims			0
" one woman lost her daughter who had small children , " says @entity59 , one of the counselors here			1
" and she did n't know how to exactly go about talking to the small children about this loss			1
" so far , the task of these counselors has been first to express sympathies for any loss , says @entity59 , " then try to sort out from them what it is that they need in this moment			1
" they listen , offer words of support and encouragement , and focus on helping in pragmatic ways to relieve other concerns -- getting families help for planning memorial services or financial support			0
" so part of it is education , " says @entity59			0
" and part of it is accessing resources for the person who is grieving			0
" while every disaster is unique , this one hit " very , very close to home , " says @entity59			1
" we knew a lot of teenagers who had friends there -- or who were shot , " she said			0
and the gunman targeted what most people feel is a safe place			1
going to the movies is even something disaster counselors often suggest that families do together as a positive experience , she said			1
opinion : can we feel safe in a crowd anymore ? @entity59 herself has a 17 - year - old daughter , and understands the fears many parents now have when their children are going out			1
" you think when you send your child to an event like that , there 's a likelihood of it being safe , " she says			0
the ability to associate with those needing counseling is helpful , but it also speaks to a professional hazard : vicarious trauma , also called secondary trauma			1
counselors can experience their own emotional toll			1
" i have a feeling in a few days i will have a story of vicarious trauma , " says psychologist @entity129 , who has been coordinating counseling efforts at the disaster response site in @entity0			1
just weeks ago she was working with evacuees from wildfires in the state			0
in 2010 she helped those affected by massive wildfires at @entity140 in @entity141			0
counselors these days are given a lot of training on how to handle the stresses , and how to recognize symptoms of secondary trauma in themselves , @entity142 says			1
" that 's why we check in with people " who are offering the counseling , to see how they are , she said			0
and " a part of our professional duty is preparing ourselves			0
" the toll it takes on counselors is a big reason there 's plenty of attrition in the industry , the psychologists say			1
and they 've had times when they chose not to take part in counseling after certain events , because they knew they were n't up to it			1
" i was tired or there were family crises going on that left me without enough reserves , " @entity171 says			0

" it 's rewarding for everyone			0
" " if i was going to be a medical doctor , i 'd be an @entity192 doctor , " adds @entity59 , who has worked in disaster response for 20 years			2
" i like a lot of energy , i think i do well under pressure			0
" whatever the perils of the profession , she says , the work is worth it			2
" if you have a skill you want to utilize it in a way that helps people			0
when they 're having the worst day of their life and you 're there to help them with that , that 's a small personal price to pay			0
" for now , they 're focused on helping the community of @entity0 move on			0
the goal for initial disaster counseling is to help people have " a little less pain at that point , " says @entity171			2
" people have a little more peace , a little more normalcy than before they chatted with us , " says @entity142			0
the result can be enormous			0
about 80 % of those who seek this kind of help often have a " spontaneous recovery , " @entity171 says			0
that does n't mean they suddenly feel fine -- it means the counseling can help steer people in a direction away from developing @entity235			2
they will go through the normal grief process and think about the events for a long time , but then will move on			0
" most people are resilient , " says @entity171 , who has been working in disaster response since 1988 and helped people after the @entity243 massacre , as well as evacuees from @entity245			2

counselors can experience their own emotional toll
there are checks in place ensure they do n't suffer secondary trauma
