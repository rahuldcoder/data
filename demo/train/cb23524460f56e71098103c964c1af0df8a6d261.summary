-- one million people registered for @entity3 's music - centric social network in the first 48 hours it became available in september			1
but some evidence indicates that @entity5 may be having trouble keeping their attention			2
however , a collaboration between @entity10 and @entity3 could open a backdoor to a part of the corporate workforce that has been locked out of @entity5 during the crucial daytime hours			1
with @entity5 -- the social service that lives within @entity3 's @entity17 program -- users can now post links to songs and albums to their @entity10 accounts			1
when you find such a message in the @entity10 stream , you can click the tweet to see a box showing details about that song from @entity17 , along with a button for listening to a short snippet of the track			1
@entity10 announced the changes on thursday			2
the @entity5 features -- available to users in the 23 countries where the @entity37 sells music -- is an extension of @entity10 's site overhaul last month that added a similar preview function for photos and video , a @entity10 spokeswoman said			1
a stroll around dozens of profiles in @entity17 just after the announcement reveals a less - than - vibrant place			2
many @entity5 pages had little recent activity , aside from profile notes about new music purchases , which can be set to post automatically			2
the initial surge in bands creating accounts and maintaining active profiles has slowed , reports say			0
( @entity3 declined to comment for this story			0
) in order to use @entity5 , you must first create an @entity17 account , which requires a credit card			1
@entity3 says it has some 150 million credit cards on file , but that requirement still creates an obstacle for children who do n't have credit cards of their own			2
kids , aged 13 to 17 , made up @entity69 's fastest - growing demographic this summer , according to data from @entity69 , which tracks activity on the social network			1
next , and here 's what could be a major hindrance for office workers , you must have the @entity17 software installed on your computer in order to use @entity5			1
the program does n't typically come packaged with corporate - issued machines			0
companies frequently block workers from installing applications without prior approval			0
they do so because nearly two - thirds of all security vulnerabilities in software from @entity89 can be prevented by disallowing workers from installing programs , according to a report from security research firm @entity92			0
but in many offices , @entity10 and @entity69 are just a few keystrokes away in a web browser			0
the workday has proved to be prime time for @entity69 , the world 's most trafficked social network			1
about a quarter of workers in the @entity102 and @entity103 say they spend more than an hour on social networking sites during office hours , according to a recent survey			0
seven percent of web pages workers accessed recently were to @entity69 , observed internet security firm @entity108			0
@entity5 widens its potential daytime audience thanks to the partnership with @entity10 , which has 175 million registered users			1
but the integration is only a one - way street , a @entity10 spokeswoman said			0
tweets can not be fed into @entity5 .			0

users of @entity3 's @entity5 social network can now post *updates* from within the app to @entity10
messages from @entity5 can contain a small widget on @entity10 containing song previews
this move could open up @entity5 to corporate workers who do n't have access to @entity17
