-- dead baby bottlenose dolphins are continuing to wash up in record numbers on the shores of the @entity4 , and scientists do not know why			1
since february 2010 to april 2011 , 406 dolphins were found either stranded or reported dead offshore			1
the occurrence has prompted the @entity8 to designate these deaths as an " unusual mortality event " or @entity11			0
the agency defines a @entity11 as a stranding incident that is unexpected or involves a significant loss of any marine mammal population			2
" this is quite a complex event and requires a lot of analysis , " said @entity16 , the agency 's marine mammal investigations coordinator			2
@entity16 said @entity8 is working closely with a variety of agencies to try to figure out not only why the bottlenose dolphins are turning up in such large quantities but also why the mammals are so young			2
" these were mostly very young dolphins , either pre-term , neonatal or very young and less than 115 centimeters , " she said			2
marine mammals are particularly susceptible to harmful algal blooms , infectious diseases , temperature and environmental changes , and human impact			2
" the @entity4 is no stranger to unusual mortality events , " @entity16 said			0
sensitivity surrounding marine life in the area is particularly high after the @entity41 oil disaster that sent millions of barrels of crude into the @entity4 nearly a year ago			1
the incident occurred on april 20 , 2010 , when a deepwater horizon rig leased to @entity41 exploded , killing 11 workers and leading to the worst oil spill in @entity49 history			1
as recently as two weeks ago , scientists documented a dead dolphin with oil on its remains , @entity16 said			1
since the start of the oil spill , a total of 15 bottlenose dolphins have been found with either confirmed or suspected oil on their carcasses			1
even after the gushing well was capped , the agency said nine oiled dolphins have been found since november 2 , 2010			1
of those nine , six were confirmed to contain oil from the incident ; one was found with oil that did not match the @entity67 samples , and two have not yet been tested			1
the dolphin deaths may be completely independent from the oil spill , @entity16 said			0
" even though they have oil on them , it may not be the cause of death , " she said			0
" we want to look at the gamut of all the possibilities			0
" the agency said bottlenose dolphins are actually the most - frequently found stranding marine mammal			1
scientists say they are equally concerned about the number of sea turtle strandings			1
similar to the dolphin deaths , an abnormally high number of turtles have been found either floating close to shore or washed up on shores in @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			2
" the vast majority of these are dead , with states in moderate to severe decomposition , " said @entity94 , @entity96 national sea turtle coordinator			1
the majority of them are @entity104 's ridley sea turtles , an endangered species since 1970			0
but some strandings included loggerheads , which are also endangered			0
" since january 1st , we 've had just under 100 strandings , " @entity94 said			0
" about 87 of those have been documented since the middle of march			0
" only about a third of those found were in good enough shape to perform necropsies , she said			0
seven turtles showed indications that they had been in accidents involving watercrafts , while another displayed injuries consistent with being caught on a hook			0
results from the rest appeared to indicate they had drowned near the bottom of the @entity4 -- possibly either from forced submergence or an acute toxic event			0
@entity130 dr. @entity129 said tissue samples from both turtles and dolphins are being carefully documented due to the civil and criminal litigation ongoing with @entity41			1
" we are looking at what is the impact of the oil spill and the response activities to the oil spill event , and what impact they had on the @entity4 ecosystem , " she said			0
" we did not say that the dolphins have died because of the oil , just that they have come back with oil on them			2

since february 2010 , 406 dolphins have been found dead or stranded
sensitivity about marine life in the area is high after the @entity41 oil disaster
scientists are also concerned about sea turtle strandings
