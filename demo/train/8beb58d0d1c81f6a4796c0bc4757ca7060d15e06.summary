-- schools of robotic fish could one day map the ocean floor , detect pollution or inspect and survey submerged boats or oil and gas pipelines , researchers at the @entity2 say			1
@entity2 researcher @entity12 works in his lab on a robotic fish he co-created			1
@entity2 engineers are showing off the latest generation of so - called robofish 15 years after they built the first one			1
the latest incarnation is sleeker , more streamlined and capable of mimicking the movements of a real fish			2
and it 's capable of exploring underwater terrain submersibles ca n't , said @entity12 , a mechanical engineer at the school			0
" some of our sponsors were thinking of using them for inspection and surveillance , " @entity12 said			0
" since these prototypes are very cheap , the idea was to build hundreds -- 200 , 500 -- and then just release them in a bay or at a port , and they would be roaming around taking measurements			0
" @entity2 researchers built their first robotic fish , " @entity37 , " in 1994			1
but @entity37 has gone the way of the dinosaur			2
@entity12 said the new generation -- modeled after bass and trout -- cost only a few hundred dollars and have only 10 parts instead of the thousands used in @entity37			1
at five to 18 inches , the new fish is much smaller than @entity37 and built from a single , soft polymer			1
and unlike @entity37 , the fish is able to be released in the oceans			1
" most of the brains , the electronics , are embedded inside , " said @entity12 , who designed the robofish with fellow @entity2 engineer @entity51			2
" we have built prototypes with the battery inside , but for my experiments , for simplicity			0
we have a lot of prototypes that are simply tethered			0
we have a cable that runs out from the body and connects to a power supply			0
" the new generation has withstood harsh conditions in the lab , including two years of testing inside tanks filled with tap water , which is corrosive to standard robots , according to @entity12 , who says the @entity37 inspired him to take the technology to the next level			2
the oil exploration company @entity73 helped fund the research , but @entity12 says the @entity75 has also expressed interest in the robofish			0
@entity2 's mechanical engineers are now turning their attention to new challenges : a robotic manta ray and a terrestrial robot in the form of a salamander			1
@entity0 's @entity85 contributed to this report .			0

engineers at @entity2 have created a new generation of robotic fish
' @entity92 ' could be used to map the ocean floor , inspect submerged boats or pipes
@entity2 researchers built their first robotic fish , " @entity37 , " in 1994
new robofish are modeled after bass and trout and cost only a few hundred dollars
