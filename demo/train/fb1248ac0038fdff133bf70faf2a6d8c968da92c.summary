as ominous music plays , the @entity3 flag flutters , child fighters wield weapons and graphic images of beheadings flash across the screen			0
at first , it seems like one of the notorious , slick jihadist recruitment videos flooding the @entity12			2
but the tone quickly shifts			0
there are images of @entity17 children crying , dead bodies lying on the floor and dire warnings : " you will discover @entity22 " and " you will die alone far from home			2
" the video campaign , which started this month , is the latest volley in a fierce battle being fought online between the @entity28 government and jihadist groups			1
what 's at stake is nothing less than the lives of the country 's youth			0
it 's an idea that 's catching on			0
online recruiting by extremist groups was among topics discussed this week at a @entity41 summit on countering violent extremism			1
several online initiatives to combat those recruiting efforts are being launched by various countries , including @entity28			1
@entity46 , brutal : 5 terror groups making headlines " this is clearly a communication war against jihadist groups , " @entity49 , head of the independent @entity50 for the @entity51 , told @entity0			1
" and it is going to be a long - term endeavor			0
" and even though the latest " battlefields " are social media platforms and no real bullets are being fired , there are @entity28 civilians already caught in what amounts to a cyber-crossfire			2
@entity63 figures on the number of @entity65 who have gone to @entity67 and @entity17 -- and which jihadist groups they have joined -- are hard to come by			1
the consensus among counter-terrorism analysts is that more than 3,000 have traveled , of whom 500 have returned			0
in @entity28 , officials say the stakes are high			2
recruiting by jihadist groups has been successful there			1
more than 400 of its citizens are believed to be fighting in @entity17 or @entity67 , according to prime minister @entity79 , and another 1,000 or so are believed to have some involvement with those groups			1
president @entity83 's government started its first @entity85 online communication campaign , " @entity86 , " on february 5			2
the effort is aimed at countering recruiting in @entity28 by @entity3 and other jihadist groups			1
the @entity28 government 's campaign , posted on @entity92 , features an online video edited in the style of an @entity3 video -- complete with harrowing music showing screenshots of @entity98 accounts from @entity3 supporters			1
after a few seconds , a @entity98 message from a purported @entity3 supporter pops up on the screen : " hey , i like the stuff you like on @entity98			0
are you interested in what 's going in @entity17 these days ? if you have any question , do n't hesitate			2
the truth is over there , you should go ! ... i can put you in touch with friends who are fighting there			0
" then , the images of crying children and the warning about " @entity22 " play			0
" this is video is very simple and goes straight to the point , " @entity49 said			0
" it is important to counter propaganda			0
it is worse to do nothing			0
" but @entity3 fired back just two days after @entity28 began its new initiative , posting its own material with @entity28 - speaking @entity3 fighters mocking the government 's campaign			1
@entity3 supporters used @entity129 to post graphics with the same typography and the same kind of slogans as the @entity28 government campaign			1
when the @entity28 government used catchphrases such as , " if you go to @entity17 , you will massacre civilians , " @entity3 supporters replied online with slogans telling potential recruits if they go to @entity17 , they would be " happy to kill " their enemies , as opposed to leading depressed lives in @entity28			1
other jihadist groups have joined in the effort to counter the @entity28 campaign			1
@entity146 , purported to be one of the most influential @entity28 jihadist recruiters , released a trailer video focused on the january attacks in @entity151			1
the video , called " @entity154 , " an obvious reference to the satirical magazine @entity153 , features @entity28 - speaking @entity157 fighters , uses special effects , music and voices of male , female and teenage jihadists			2
speakers in the video praise the names of the brothers who carried out the attacks , and they try to argue against the @entity28 government with lines such as , " @entity28 pretends to be a country of free speech but censors all the time our video			1
" last september , the @entity28 government commissioned an anti-radicalization organization called the @entity174 to @entity175 , which goes by the @entity28 acronym @entity177 , to counter online recruitment of @entity28 youths by jihadist groups			1
" the recruitment and the first contacts are most of the time established on the @entity12 , " said @entity181 , director of @entity177			0
according to a study published by the @entity177 , jihadists in charge of online recruitment use specific arguments to attract young people			0
these arguments target five different categories of individuals who could be susceptible to recruitment such as " heroic knight " for men or " humanitarian cause " for women			0
other categories include young people who are avid players of war video games , aimless teens looking for a leader or people who are simply " in need of power			0
" according to the @entity177 , young @entity28 people who get involved with jihadist groups are from a range of economic , social and religious backgrounds			1
in fact , most of the families whose teens become involved with jihadist groups consider themselves to be nonreligious or atheist , the @entity177 says			1
" the jihadist in charge of online recruitment will look for key words on social media , " @entity181 said on @entity28 tv @entity214			1
" they will look for people who have @entity98 or @entity129 statuses mentioning they want to be nurses or social workers , for example			0
" @entity28 journalist @entity226 knows that type of effort well			1
during a recent month , she pretended to be " @entity229 , " a young @entity28 woman converted to @entity175 who wanted to join @entity3			2
in her book " in the skin of a @entity235 , " she tells how she decided to be in virtual contact with @entity28 jihadi already in @entity17 and @entity67			1
one of them , a 38 - year - old man , was especially insistent and did everything he could to get her to travel to @entity240 , @entity17			2
" i had a fake @entity98 account and i wanted to understand why a young @entity28 woman would want to leave her family and her friends to join @entity3 , " @entity226 told @entity0			2
" i was shocked by how the jihadists become quickly ever - present in your daily life			0
when they have a target they wo n't stop			0
" a 16 - year - old @entity28 girl that the government identifies only as " @entity253 " echoes that , saying repeated contacts began after she posted online that she wanted an altruistic job -- she wanted to be a nurse			1
" more than 50 people were contacting me per day			0
they contacted me in the morning , at night			0
they were men , then women			0
they wanted me to attack a synagogue in @entity266 ( @entity28 ) , " said @entity262 , according to the @entity28 government			1
some @entity175 in @entity28 - speaking countries say the government 's new campaign is culturally insulting , and holds @entity175 as a group to ridicule			1
a @entity28 - speaking @entity272 organization named @entity273 said the @entity28 campaign completely is " full of generalizations and conflations			2
" one online graphic in the campaign shows nine signs of radicalization parents should look for in their teens , including " changing the way they dress , " " stopping listening to music " or " eating differently			0
" " it 's not because we have a beard or that we do n't listen to mainstream music that we are necessarily going to attack someone , " @entity286 , a 22 - year - old @entity273 student in @entity151 told @entity0			0
" again , in @entity28 , the @entity273 community is blamed for jihadism			2
" the problem is not @entity12 , the problem is @entity296 in @entity28 ... @entity28 is not fighting against the real social problems that push people to go join @entity3 , " @entity286 said			1
the @entity28 government insists that its campaign is legitimate and is to " prevent young people from turning to terrorism activities			1
" " we know that 90 percent of @entity28 young jihadists started on the @entity12 , " interior minister @entity303 said at a press conference the day the government launched the website			1
some terrorism experts agree with the @entity28 government 's strategy			1
" it is not supposed to stigmatize the @entity273 community , it is supposed to stigmatize terrorists			0
the @entity28 government needed to be shocking and had to make a powerful statement , " says terrorism expert @entity312			2
" this needs to be fought the same way intelligence services would fight against a sect -- with mass mind control through propaganda			0
" experts say it 's too early to tell whether the new campaign is producing results , but they point out that @entity28 is not the first country to have started an online platform against @entity3 propaganda			2
the @entity325 launched the campaign " @entity327 " last september , which also used a graphic video using @entity3 's own pictures			0
" all governments involved in the war against terrorism are trying to find new tools to stop jihadists ' online recruitment , " @entity49 told @entity0			0
" internet recruiting is new , we all grope around and see what could work best			0

more than 400 @entity28 citizens are believed to be fighting in @entity17 or @entity67 , the government says
@entity28 has launched an effort to counter online recruiting by jihadist groups
