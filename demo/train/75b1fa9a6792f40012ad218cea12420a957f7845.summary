-- " we are innocent			0
" for six years , that has been the cry that has united @entity2 and her @entity4 ex-boyfriend , as they have faced trials in the murder of @entity9 's former roommate @entity10			1
but that unity may be crumbling , as she and @entity13 prepare to appeal their convictions before @entity4 's @entity16 next year			1
@entity9 , who is living in the @entity17 , appears to be sticking by the maxim			1
just over two weeks ago , she posted it in a photo to her @entity23 page in @entity4 : " @entity24			0
" but @entity13 , who is still in @entity4 , no longer seems so adamant about it , as the prospect of a long prison term stares him in the face			2
he was sentenced to 25 , @entity9 to 28 years in prison			2
yes , but though he still says that the evidence exonerates them both , he is using more selective language			1
" there is nothing against me and nothing very strong against @entity2 , " @entity13 recently told @entity0			2
" and in my case , i really did nothing wrong , and i do n't want to pay for someone else 's peculiar behavior			1
" @entity9 's behavior on the morning @entity41 was found stabbed to death in the apartment she and @entity9 shared seems to be a new hitch for @entity13			1
that was early november 2007 , and he and @entity9 had only been dating for a week			2
@entity13 expanded on his doubts in a new interview with @entity4 television this week that aired in part on @entity51			2
@entity9 had spent the night with him but went back to her place to shower , he said			2
when she returned , she was " very agitated			0
" she told him that it looked like someone had broken in and that there was blood in the bathroom , @entity13 said			0
but rather than call the police , she showered and returned to his place			0
he finds it odd , he now says			0
" certainly i asked her questions , " he said			0
" why did you take a shower ? why did she spend so much time there ? " he did n't get any real answers from her , he said in the interview			0
lawyer 's advice @entity13 's apparent distancing from @entity9 echoes the position of his lawyer , @entity77			1
" it 's imperative that the @entity4 courts consider @entity13 's case separate from @entity2 's case , " he said			1
" by necessity , he has to distance himself and his case from @entity2 and her case			0
" in a note on her @entity23 page , @entity9 acknowledges @entity13 's new stance and appears to back it up			1
she said he 's a scapegoat			0
" the only reason he has been dragged into this is because he happens to be my alibi , " she wrote			0
since @entity41 's death , @entity9 and @entity13 have gone through a legal odyssey that led to a conviction that was overturned , followed by a second conviction			1
another man , drifter and drug dealer @entity10 from the @entity101 is currently serving 16 years for @entity41 's murder			1
he was tried separately from @entity9 and @entity103			1
he admitted having sex with the young @entity106 woman but said someone else killed her while he was in the bathroom .			0

the united cry of innocence may be crumbling , as @entity13 changes his tone
he finds @entity9 's behavior , the morning @entity10 was found dead , odd
his lawyer advises that his case must be considered separately from hers
@entity13 still says the evidence exonerates them both
