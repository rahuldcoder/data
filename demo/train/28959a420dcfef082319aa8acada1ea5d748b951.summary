the @entity1 prime minister on wednesday reacted strongly to what the @entity2 said was a mistake by president @entity5 during a @entity7 ceremony			1
the trouble came tuesday when @entity5 paid tribute to @entity10 , the former @entity1 officer who escaped @entity12 imprisonment in @entity13 and provided firsthand accounts to the @entity15 of atrocities			1
@entity10 received the award posthumously			0
" before one trip across enemy lines , resistance fighters told him that @entity21 were being murdered on a massive scale , and smuggled him into the @entity23 and a @entity1 death camp to see for himself			1
@entity10 took that information to president @entity27 , giving one of the first accounts of the @entity30 and imploring to the world to take action , " @entity5 said			0
the president 's use of the term " @entity1 death camp , " rather than @entity12 death camp sparked outrage in @entity1			2
@entity5 's words " touched all @entity1 , " prime minister @entity39 said in a statement			1
" we always react in the same way when ignorance , lack of knowledge , bad intentions lead to such a distortion of history , so painful for us here in @entity1 , in a country which suffered like no other in @entity52 during @entity13 " we can not accept such words even if they are spoken by the leader of a friendly power -- or perhaps especially in such situations -- since we expect diligence , care and respect from our friend on issues of such importance as @entity13 remembrance			1
" the @entity2 issued a statement from @entity66 spokesman @entity65 on the president 's wrong word choice			0
" the president misspoke -- he was referring to @entity12 death camps in @entity1 , " the statement said			0
" we regret this misstatement , which should not detract from the clear intention to honor mr. @entity10 and those brave citizens who stood on the side of human dignity in the face of tyranny			2
" @entity2 spokesman @entity78 echoed that message in comments to reporters wednesday			0
" on several occasions -- including his visit last year to the @entity23 memorial , his remarks at the @entity86 just last month and his video message at the 65th anniversary of the liberation of @entity90 -- president @entity5 has paid tribute to the terrible loss of innocent @entity1 in @entity12 death camps during the @entity30			1
" again , we regret the misstatement , but that 's what it was			2
" @entity1 foreign minister @entity98 tweeted tuesday night : " @entity2 apologizes for outrageous blunder			2
@entity100 will take his position in the morning			0
it 's a shame that this important ceremony was overshadowed by ignorance and incompetence			0
" @entity39 said wednesday the incident could pose an opportunity for the @entity108 " to support @entity1 in its efforts towards historical truth , towards the correct phrasings , the right assessment of what happened during @entity13 on @entity1 territory and throughout @entity52			1
... when someone says ' @entity1 death camps , ' it is as if there were no @entity119 , no @entity121 responsibility , as if there was no @entity123 -- that is why our @entity1 sensitivity in these situations is so much more than just simply a feeling of national pride			0
" @entity39 said he is convinced that " our @entity108 friends are capable of a stronger reaction ... than just the correction itself and the regret which we heard from the @entity2 spokesperson			2
" we take note of these words , but it seems that it would be even more important for the @entity108 than for @entity1 to end this with class			2
this is how one acts with regard to tried - and - tested friends , but this is also how one acts in your own , well - defined interest			0
" @entity5 has spoken of the bravery of @entity1 during @entity13 in past speeches			1
last year , he visited the @entity150 honoring those who perished in the @entity30			0
according to the website of the @entity86 in @entity153 , at least 1.5 million @entity1 citizens were sent into forced labor in @entity121 territory between 1939 and 1945			1
" hundreds of thousands were also imprisoned in @entity12 concentration camps , " it says in its @entity158			0
" it is estimated that the @entity121 killed at least 1.9 million non-jewish @entity1 civilians during @entity13 in addition , the @entity121 murdered at least 3 million @entity21 citizens of @entity1			1

@entity5 spokesman : " we regret the misstatement , but that 's what it was "
@entity1 prime minister @entity39 says , " we can not accept such words "
