-- @entity7 's government is waging " a war of extermination " against its own people , the prime minister of @entity5 said tuesday , according to state media , hours after a failed four - day ceasefire during a @entity3 holiday left hundreds dead			1
in strongly worded comments to the @entity15 network , @entity12 also accused foreign powers of standing by while president @entity18 's forces carried out a slaughter			2
" what is happening in @entity7 is not a civil war but a genocide , a war of extermination with a license to kill by the @entity7 government and the international community , " he said , according to the official @entity20			1
@entity12 , who 's also @entity5 's foreign minister , said he had confidence in @entity32 - @entity31 envoy to @entity7 @entity33 -- but that his country did not trust @entity36 's government			1
@entity33 had pushed for government forces and rebels to stop fighting during @entity39 , a major @entity3 holiday that began friday and ended monday			2
but it soon became clear the violence was continuing almost unabated			0
@entity7 rebels , @entity44 militia discuss cease - fire " when the @entity7 government announced that it would comply with the truce , it also announced that its military would respond to anything that took place on the ground , and it was clear from this rhetoric that there was no truce , " said @entity12 , according to @entity20			1
" everyone knows what the solution is and what the @entity7 people want			0
everything that is happening now is a waste of time and just buying time to kill the @entity7 people and to destroy the @entity7 infrastructure			2
" the prime minister said he sensed " a bigger awakening " among @entity69 nations and in the wider international community over the crisis in @entity7 , despite moves by @entity73 and @entity74 to block tougher @entity76 action			1
but , he said , a " paralysis " would prevent action until after the outcome of the @entity80 elections			0
a group that documents the names of those killed in @entity7 's conflict , the @entity86 , calculated the total number of those killed during the failed ceasefire as 407			2
the report from the @entity86 , which works closely with the opposition @entity91 , put the total civilian toll at 32,013 over some 20 months of violence , with 2,900 government soldiers killed in the same period			0
the @entity91 said 163 people were killed tuesday , mostly in @entity96 and its suburbs , and in @entity99 province , where airstrikes pummeled a residential neighborhood in the city of @entity103			2
regime forces inflicted " heavy losses " on rebel fighters in clashes in the @entity96 countryside and @entity111 provinces and near the city of @entity113 , the @entity104 reported			0

the state - run @entity144 newspaper quoted @entity147 spokesman @entity146 as saying the envoy would have " in depth communication " with @entity74 officials during his two - day visit			2
@entity74 backs @entity33 's efforts to find a political solution to the crisis , rather than the use of force , @entity146 is quoted as saying			1
following monday 's meeting in @entity158 , @entity73 accused the @entity32 of double standards for failing to condemn a car bombing in a @entity162 stronghold near the capital , @entity96			1
@entity7 's foreign ministry also wrote to @entity32 secretary general ban ki - moon to criticize the @entity32 's failure to condemn such attacks -- an omission it said " encouraged terrorists to continue committing crimes against the @entity7 people			1
" @entity139 said on his own @entity172 feed that @entity73 was disappointed at the lack of support for @entity33 's call for a holiday truce , but that it appreciated his efforts to try to " find potential collaborative ways for the international community " to help stabilize @entity7			1
the @entity73 - @entity182 @entity181 will meet in @entity183 october 31 , the foreign ministry said			0
speaking after his meeting with @entity139 , @entity33 said neither side in @entity7 is showing signs of backing down			1
" the government says they are fighting terrorists and only terrorists , and that it is their duty to do so -- to protect their people			0
and the other side says we 're fighting a very cruel government that is persecuting us , and we 're defending ourselves , " @entity33 said after the meeting			0
he recalled speaking with a woman who has one son in the @entity7 military and another son in the rebel @entity201			0
" if that is not civil war , i do n't know what is , " @entity33 said			0
diplomacy with @entity73 is a delicate dance			0
@entity73 , along with @entity74 , has repeatedly vetoed attempts at the @entity76 to take stronger action against @entity18			2
