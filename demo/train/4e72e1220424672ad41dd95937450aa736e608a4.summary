a settlement was reached friday with the company at the center of a january chemical leak that contaminated the water supply for 300,000 @entity5 , according to an attorney for the plaintiffs			1
@entity8 would transfer $ 2.9 million into a trust fund that will be used " for the greater good , " according to @entity11 , one of the attorneys in the class - action lawsuit			2
" things like chemical testing and medical studies , " said @entity11 , who called the trust fund " a mechanism to answer some of the things that are still unanswered			0
" on january 9 , more than 7,000 gallons of 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol ( @entity20 ) -- a licorice - odored chemical used to clean coal -- leaked into the @entity23 from a @entity25 storage tank			1
the result was a do - not - use order that left about 300,000 people in and around @entity29 , the state capital , unable to drink or bathe for several days			1
a week after the spill , @entity8 filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection			2
@entity11 said the money for the proposed trust fund would come from the $ 3 million insurance settlement @entity25 received for spill - related claims			0
under the terms of the agreement , which still have to be approved by a judge , 24 pending lawsuits against @entity8 would be settled			1
these were the suits brought by plaintiffs who were customers of @entity43 and whom either lived in , worked in or owned a business in the affected area between january 9 and january 19 , according to @entity11			0

@entity11 -- who was among those affected by the spill -- thinks that a public trust fund is the best way to use the $ 2.9 million , but he said individuals would have the option to receive a onetime payment instead			0
with an estimated 300,000 eligible claims , the most any one person could get would be less than $ 10 .			0
