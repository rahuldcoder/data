gay conservatives are undertaking the most coordinated effort yet to change the @entity3 's position on same - sex marriage			1
their approach : one state and one @entity3 activist at a time			0
while the official stance of the @entity3 says the " the union of one man and one woman must be upheld as the national standard , " conservative same - sex marriage advocates want to change that			1
@entity15 to marry hopes that by the time the @entity3 convention rolls around in 2016 , they will have recruited or persuaded enough like - minded party activists and young conservatives to remove the restrictive language and replace it with this : " we encourage and welcome a thoughtful conversation among @entity3 about the meaning and importance of marriage , and commit our party to respect for all families and fairness and freedom for all @entity30			1
" to accomplish that goal , @entity31 to marry , a nonpartisan advocacy group , has launched a national grassroots campaign targeting @entity3 activists -- the most powerful impediment to marriage freedom in the party -- in key presidential nominating states that they can " agree to disagree " on same - sex marriage			1
@entity41 , campaign manager at @entity42 , said they are not looking for an endorsement of same - sex marriage , " but that it 's a valid point of view			1
" their campaign is targeted and funded			0
they have launched in the first four and arguably most influential of the presidential nominating states : @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			1
and the national organization @entity42 has committed $ 1 million to the effort			0
@entity15 thinks that momentum is on its side			0
more republicans are announcing their support for same - sex marriage			1
three openly gay @entity3 ran for @entity62 this year ( one lost in the primaries ) and @entity3 lawmakers are slowly announcing their support			2
in addition , @entity15 point to a @entity68 public opinion poll that shows 40 % of @entity3 -- and 56 % of @entity3 under age 45 -- support same - sex marriage			1
the group just completed its lobbying campaign in @entity53 , which might be their easiest stop , since the state party , which leans libertarian , has officially made marriage a non-issue by stripping all social issues from its platform			2
@entity82 - minded @entity3 @entity81 assemblywoman @entity80 said she is working with @entity15 to convince the @entity83 to follow @entity53 's lead			2
" if we truly are the party of freedom , we need to be the party of choice , " @entity85 , who was raised by a lesbian couple in @entity87 , @entity88 , told @entity89			0
but not all states share @entity53 's view and not all local @entity3 chapters are run by libertarians			2
in @entity52 , for instance , where @entity100 conservatives are a dominant force in the party , resistance is certain			0
" any entity is more than welcome to try and make their case , " @entity108 , chairman of the @entity109 said , " but marriage certainly is a difficult swallow for our rank and file			2
" @entity15 ' next stop is @entity54 , another state with a socially conservative @entity3 base			0
@entity41 , who is from the @entity54 and is gay , says he understands evangelicals ' and @entity119 ' concerns and believe that he has the ability to at least soften their opposition			0
we 'll find out when the @entity3 finalizes its platform in @entity125 in the summer of 2016 .			0
