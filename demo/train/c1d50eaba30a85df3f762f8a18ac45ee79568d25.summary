she - @entity0 rejoice ! a new @entity3 comic has arrived			1
the comic is one in a series of " @entity8 " character origin digital one - shots published by @entity7			1
not a continuing story of @entity3 , it is rather a dramatic retelling of her beginnings			1
wondering what a one - shot is ? here 's a primer if you 're more a fan of the animated " @entity3 : @entity19 " tv series that began airing in 1985 : " a one - shot is simply an issue ( or digital release ) that tells a full story on its own , " writer @entity20 said			1
" ... all the way up through the 1990s , telling single - issue stories was the norm			2
but today stories are increasingly told over several issues that are later collected into books , so a one - shot is becoming an unusual , special thing			2
" the @entity3 digital one - shot delves into our heroine 's pre-princess of @entity38 's past -- before the @entity39 came to her , before she became the most powerful woman in the @entity8 and before she ever uttered the phrase , " for the honor of @entity43 ! " kidnapped as a baby by the evil @entity49 , @entity3 's alter ego @entity3 -- twin sister of @entity46 ( who later became @entity46 ) -- was raised by the evil @entity50 in the dark dimension of @entity52			1
lord @entity50 renamed @entity53 and brainwashed her into become a villain			0
@entity53 became a force captain in @entity57 's army and @entity57 's own personal assassin			0
upon return to her birth planet , @entity61 , @entity53 was initially @entity46 's enemy			0
female superhero ' @entity3 ' marks 25th anniversary " readers unfamiliar with her history might be surprised to learn that she was a very different person before that transformation , " @entity20 said , " but the hero she would become is there , slumbering inside of her , and that 's what our story is really about			1
" put simply : an unhappy young girl who dreams of a better life discovers she 's a princess and her dreams come true			0
" but @entity3 's story is such a great inversion of that , " @entity20 said , " because rather than being just a passive dreamer , she 's actually already a very powerful character			1
sure she 's a powerful character working for evil , but that only makes her journey all the more heroic and interesting			1
the messages of strength , capability and redemption , those are some really empowering and sophisticated ideas for a princess character aimed at girls from 30 years ago			0
" the new release presents a darker , more unusual take on @entity3			1
" i think the trick for me was drawing this version of @entity3 as not really evil but detached and cold , " artist @entity95 said			1
" she was n't born as this deadly @entity57 enforcer but was made one , and over the course of the story , we can see how she 's been kept in line and made to do things that are against her nature			2
i tried to show in a couple of close - up shots that her eyes are not those of a killer , and in those shots , divided her face down the middle with the panel borders to show her split nature			0
" in creating the planet @entity114 , @entity95 worked with colorist @entity116 to " create the most infernal atmosphere possible			0
" they surrounded @entity3 with fire , smoke , dead trees and hopeless people to get that bleak , drab , uninviting feel			2
an individual dragged down by dire circumstances beyond her control , @entity3 -- in true hero fashion -- rose above those circumstances to become an inspiration to the world around her			2
@entity95 said he believes @entity3 still resonates with audiences because " like @entity132 , @entity3 is iconic			1
she stood , and stands , as a strong and good - hearted character that anyone of any age can get behind			1
" the other " @entity8 " comic releases consist of a printed miniseries in which @entity49 -- having rewritten the laws of reality on @entity61 -- rules from inside @entity43			0
in addition , there is a digital series of 10 - page stories featuring fresh takes on the origins of individual characters that are fan favorites , such as @entity147 and @entity148			2
the new @entity3 is one in a series of full - length one - shots showcasing the origin of a particular character			1
past comics told the back stories of @entity46 and @entity155 : @entity156 ugly @entity158 sweater " the line is diverse , " @entity161 executive @entity160 said , " but every title shares one thing in common : we 're not playing things safe			0
' @entity8 ' is n't just part of our cultural past ; it 's alive and constantly growing			0
" for the most part , fan response has been overwhelmingly positive , but some die - hards resist the retooling of classic characters			0
" fans are thrilled to see @entity174 back in action , " @entity160 said			0
" not everybody wants to see any changes , of course , but @entity156 -- ever since he first premiered -- has evolved			0
hey , when he first came out , there was no prince @entity46 ! so long as you stay true to the core concepts , it 's always fun to explore the possibilities			0

new @entity3 comic is a *revamp* of the story about how the @entity19 came to be
digital release is a dark twist on @entity3 's origin
artist : " @entity3 is iconic . she stood , and stands , as a strong and good - hearted character "
