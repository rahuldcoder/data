@entity0 -- a painting dismissed for years as the work of an unknown artist has been identified as a piece by @entity6 , after x-rays revealed an image of two wrestlers fighting underneath the floral still life			1
" @entity20 with @entity21 and @entity22 " has hung in the @entity12 in the town of @entity14 , in the eastern @entity15 , since 1974 , but doubts over its authorship have dogged the painting for decades			2
experts argued that the large format , the location of the signature , and the huge number of flowers in the composition all suggested the painting was the creation of an unidentified artist , rather than the famed @entity15 painter , and the work was officially " dismissed " from his catalogue in 2003			1
" there were so many questions around this painting , " explained @entity37 , researcher at the @entity38 in @entity39			0
" there were a lot of things about it that were strange -- it could n't quite be trusted [ as a piece by @entity6 ]			1
" but the latest high - tech x-ray imaging has allowed scholars to re-examine an underpainting , featuring two wrestlers fighting , first glimpsed in the 1990s , and confirm that the picture is indeed by @entity6			1
saving @entity6 's home from dereliction @entity6 ( 1853 - 1890 ) created some of the world 's best known and most loved paintings , including " sunflowers , " " irises " and " the @entity61 , " and a number of self - portraits			1
he was virtually unknown as an artist during his lifetime , but his reputation soared in the years after his suicide at the age of 37 following years of mental illness , and his works now hang in major museums and galleries around the globe			2
during the art market boom of the late 1980s and early 1990s , three of @entity6 's works succeeded each other as the most expensive paintings ever sold : " sunflowers " for $ 39.9 million , " irises " for $ 53.9 million , and " @entity80 " for $ 82.5 million			2
" the painting was x-rayed before , so we knew there was something underneath , but the image was not very clear , " he told @entity1			0
" this new technique gave us a much clearer image , and lots of details about the pigments and the paint layers			2
" we know @entity6 painted wrestlers , we know much more than we did 10 years ago about the pigments he used , and we know that at the time , when re-using a canvas , he simply painted over the top of the previous image , without an intermediate layer			1
" this painting was a complete match with all the research that has been done over the past 10 years			0
" @entity6 , @entity100 speak from beyond grave @entity6 wrote about the wrestlers picture -- which he painted as an assignment during his studies at the art academy in @entity106 -- in a letter in january 1886 : " this week i painted a large thing with two nude torsos -- two wrestlers , " adding that he was delighted with the result			1
research suggests that the still life was painted on the same canvas fewer than six months later , while in @entity116			0
" the top layer was applied not long afterwards , " said @entity37			0
" we can tell this because he used a lot of zinc white in the wrestlers picture , and it dries very , very slowly			0
" the x-rays show that it had not hardened completely when the still life was added , causing some cracks in the paint of the flower picture , which suggests it was painted less than half a year later			0
" @entity37 said there was always the possibility of discovering other " unknown " @entity6 works in future			1
" there are other paintings that have n't been x-rayed , " he told @entity1			0
" there are always other opportunities			0

" still life with *meadow* flowers and roses " dismissed as work of unknown artist
large format , *subject* , and signature all pointed to painting being by someone other than @entity6
new high - tech x-ray imaging revealed underpainting of wrestlers , details of pigments used
experts say they are now *confident* that the piece is definitely by " @entity156 " artist @entity6
