think hotels are deliberately blocking your personal @entity2 networks so you 'll buy theirs ? no , it 's not just a conspiracy theory			1
it turns out the federal government is concerned about it , too			0
@entity9 has agreed to pay a $ 600,000 fine after the @entity10 found the company blocked consumer @entity2 networks last year during an event at a hotel and conference center in @entity17			1
at the same time , @entity9 was charging exhibitors and others as much as $ 1,000 per device to access the hotel 's wireless network , the @entity10 announced friday			1
" consumers who purchase cellular data plans should be able to use them without fear that their personal internet connection will be blocked by their hotel or conference center , " @entity24 chief @entity23 said in a statement			2
federal law prohibits people from using a device that interferes with cellular , gps or wireless networks			0
it 's the first time the @entity10 has investigated a hotel property for blocking its guests ' @entity2 , according to a senior @entity10 official with knowledge of the investigation			1
the unlawful blocking is n't " jamming " in the traditional sense , where someone uses a jammer device to block wireless signals			2
instead , @entity9 employees were using the hotel 's own @entity2 system to block other people 's hot spots , the @entity10 official said			1
the order does n't just affect one @entity9 property			2
under the @entity10 consent decree , @entity9 must not block guests ' @entity2 at all of the properties it owns and manages			1
the company must also file compliance plans with the @entity10 every three months for three years			0
a federal investigation of the @entity63 and @entity64 in @entity17 found that @entity9 employees had used " containment features of a @entity2 monitoring system " at the hotel to prevent people from accessing their own personal @entity2 networks			1
" it is unacceptable for any hotel to intentionally disable personal hot spots while also charging consumers and small businesses high fees to use the hotel 's own @entity2 network , " @entity70 said			1
" this practice puts consumers in the untenable position of either paying twice for the same service or forgoing internet access altogether			0
" the @entity83 @entity9 issued the following statement friday afternoon defending its actions : " @entity9 has a strong interest in ensuring that when our guests use our @entity2 service , they will be protected from rogue wireless hot spots that can cause degraded service , insidious cyber-attacks and identity theft , " the statement said			1
" like many other institutions and companies in a wide variety of industries , including hospitals and universities , the @entity63 protected its @entity2 network by using @entity10 - authorized equipment provided by well - known , reputable manufacturers			2
" we believe that the @entity108 's actions were lawful			0
we will continue to encourage the @entity10 to pursue a rulemaking in order to eliminate the ongoing confusion resulting from today 's action and to assess the merits of its underlying policy			0
" in march 2013 , the @entity10 received a complaint from someone who had attended an event at the @entity63 and claimed the hotel was " jamming mobile hot spots so that you ca n't use them in the convention space , " the @entity10 statement said			2
saving a @entity124 blocking a traveler 's personal @entity2 will only serve to aggravate hotel guests further , said @entity127 , who blogs about travel at @entity129			1
" travelers are already annoyed that higher - end hotels continue to charge for subpar @entity2 , which is why they bring their own , " @entity127 told @entity130			0
" so it 's really galling when you hear of a company like @entity9 , which has a good reputation that does something that causes a major inconvenience to its customers			0
and the fact that they profited off of their customers in such a blatant way also does n't help			0
" @entity9 and its brands operate more than 3,000 hotels in the @entity147 , according to the company 's website .			0
