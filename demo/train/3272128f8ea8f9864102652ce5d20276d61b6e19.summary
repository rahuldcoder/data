-- @entity2 's @entity1 , the world 's longest - serving monarch , celebrated his 84th birthday monday , giving the @entity6 country some much - needed cheer after months of devastating flooding nationwide			1
also celebrated as @entity10 , the occasion launched a week of national celebrations , including a birthday speech by prime minister @entity13 on behalf of the @entity2 people , a public audience by the king during a grand state ceremony and the pardon of some 26,000 prisoners			1
a new book celebrating his seventh decade as monarch has also hit stores			0
titled " king bhumibol adulyadej : a @entity32 , " and with an editorial advisory board chaired by former prime minister @entity34 , the book offers a look at the king 's life , work , laws governing the throne , along with hundreds of pictures			1
in a rare appearance , the king on monday addressed the recent floods that have devastated the country , urging people to overcome divisions and set up sustainable water management			2
" it is a duty of everyone to cooperate and help each other , " he said			0
the @entity46 - born and @entity47 - educated king has reigned since 1950 , succeeding his brother @entity48 , whose death in 1946 of a gunshot wound in bed remains a mystery			0
also known as @entity1 , the king commands great love , respect and @entity57 - like status among @entity58 despite his lack of direct power under @entity2 's constitutional monarchy , in which decision - making rests with the prime minister			1
the @entity64 stipulates that the king " shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship and shall not be violated " and that " no person shall expose the king to any sort of accusation or action			0
" he has wielded his moral authority to intervene in political crises over the decades , but his failing health -- he has been residing at @entity77 's @entity76 -- has raised questions about the country 's future , as it struggles to recover from the most recent spasms of political unrest in the aftermath of a 2006 military coup			1
his son , @entity85 , is his heir apparent			0
but talk about the future role of the monarchy -- most especially if it 's deemed less than supportive -- has been hampered by @entity2 's lese majeste laws , which ban criticism of the monarchy			1
last week , @entity92 urged the amendment of @entity2 's lese majeste laws after 61 - year - old @entity94 was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sending four @entity97 text messages considered offensive to the @entity99 and the monarchy -- a case that also drew the concern of the @entity103			1
" the severity of penalties being meted out for lese majeste offenses in @entity2 is shocking , " said @entity92 's @entity104 , @entity105 on the @entity92 web site			0
the group pointed to the @entity1 's own 2005 birthday speech in suggesting he invited criticism : " if the @entity1 can do no wrong , it is akin to looking down upon him because the @entity1 is not being treated as a human being			1
but the @entity1 can do wrong , " according to a translation by the @entity2 newspaper , @entity117			2
the @entity118 has recommended the amendment of @entity2 's lese majeste laws			2
on monday the @entity117 released a @entity120 survey on the king			0
among the findings : 60 percent of those polled most appreciate his kindness for the economy ; 78 percent pledged to be honest in honor of his birthday ; 61 percent would like to light candles and sing songs to wish him well ; and 73 percent believe disunity most upsets the king			0
in addition to @entity85 , @entity1 and his wife of more than 60 years , @entity136 , have three other children : @entity144 , @entity145 , and @entity146 , whose work promoting schools , nutrition and health care for the needy has earned her the nickname " @entity148			2

@entity1 's 84th birthday sparks a week of celebrations
country has been suffering from devastating flooding
king @entity1 's wields moral authority but not political power
laws banning criticism of the monarchy are *controversial* especially after a texter was last week *jailed* for 20 years
