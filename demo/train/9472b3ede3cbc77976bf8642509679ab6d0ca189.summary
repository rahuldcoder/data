-- we do n't yet know all the facts behind the now - infamous , poorly fact - checked story in @entity5 about an alleged gang rape at the @entity7			1
what we do know : @entity5 at first blamed the alleged victim , " @entity11 " -- rather than its own journalistic sloppiness -- for so - called " discrepancies " ( before changing its callous statement )			1
and new reporting by the @entity15 does reveal that @entity11 's friends , cited in the story , say they are skeptical about some of the details			1
still , they all believe that @entity11 experienced something " horrific " that night , in the words of one , and we do know that @entity11 stands by her story			1
most of the doubts about it were apparently raised by those she 's accusing , including the fraternity and main alleged assailant -- whom , i guess , we 're supposed to believe instead			0
but one other thing we do know is that gang rapes just like what @entity11 is alleging do happen -- too often , and all over @entity34			1
here 's one measure : today the @entity37 's @entity36 released a new report showing that 80 % of college rapes and sexual assaults go unreported to police , and 67 % of such attacks by non-students go unreported			1
it would be a terrible and infuriating mistake to use the confusion around @entity11 's story as a convenient way to discount this reality			1
while @entity5 's reporting was clearly shoddy , for example , some writers who initially poked holes in @entity11 's story did so for ideological motives			1
for instance , even before the reporting lapses were revealed , conservative commentator @entity55 called @entity11 's story unbelievable			1
" it is not credible , " @entity55 wrote in the @entity58			0
" i do n't believe it			1
" instead , @entity55 insisted , @entity11 's account was " a convenient conversation for an @entity64 © of rape culture , " something , incidentally , @entity55 also doubts to be real			1
" ' rape culture ' suggests that there is a large and obvious belief system that condones and enables rape as an end in itself in @entity34 , " @entity55 later wrote in @entity66			1
it 's all hogwash , says @entity55 , alleging that the very idea of " rape culture " is just " an elaborate political lie intended to strengthen the hand of activists			1
" in other words , whatever the reality of what happened to @entity11 , @entity55 and others were skeptical because they simply do n't believe rapes like that happen with the participation of groups of assailants , let alone the complicity of bystanders			1
this is where they 're mistaken			0
on october 24 , 2009 , in @entity93 , @entity94 , a 15 - year - old girl was repeatedly raped by a group of young men in a courtyard outside their high school homecoming dance			2
six assailants were eventually tried and ultimately pleaded guilty or were convicted			0
over two hours , as the assault occurred , as many as 20 other people watched			0
" as people announced over time that this was going on , more people came to see , and some actually participated , " said lt. @entity104 of the @entity105			0
the witnesses did n't report the crime to police			2
on august 12 , 2012 , a 16 - year - old girl who was incapacitated by alcohol was raped by two high school football players in @entity115 , @entity116			2
in the backseat of a car and later in the basement of a house , the two assailants stripped their victim naked and took turns , one inserting his fingers into her vagina , the other forcing his penis into her mouth			2
this is not in dispute			0
both football players were convicted of the crime			0
as the crimes were taking place , friends took pictures that were shared with other friends			0
ultimately , @entity116 investigators confiscated 17 cell phones used in sharing the pictures			0
some of those at the party even posted pictures of the unresponsive girl , being carried by her wrists and ankles , on @entity147 with words like " rape " and " drunk girl			2
" in @entity115 , four adults have been indicted after being accused of covering up the incident , including the school superintendent			0
on may 11 , 2014 , an 18 - year - old woman was allegedly sexually assaulted by three students at a party after their high school prom			2
the three alleged assailants , all prominent athletes , have been charged with multiple counts of aggravated assault and are awaiting trial			0
according to police , at least one person witnessed the assault in the room where it took place and several other people at the party knew it was happening			0
but no one stopped it			0
in june 2014 , a 16 - year - old girl went to a party where she was allegedly drugged and raped			2
she does n't remember what happened , only passing out and waking up the next morning with her clothes messed up			2
but weeks later , the young woman received text messages of photos showing her unconscious and undressed , apparently taken at the same party			0
the photos went viral on the @entity180 , with @entity147 users posting photos of themselves in the same awkward position , mocking the alleged victim			2
when the @entity186 asked someone who posted such a picture on @entity147 why he did it , he simply said he was " bored at 1 a.m. and decided to wake up " his @entity147 feed			0
this is by no means an exhaustive account of incidents in which young women have been gang raped while bystanders have either cheered the crime , hidden it or stood by in silence			1
in the case of @entity11 , i believe in innocence until guilt is proven , even as i realize that we have a society where rapists are given the benefit of the doubt , often despite overwhelming evidence , while female victims are shamed ( see multiple @entity209 allegations )			0
the fact is , there does n't appear to be any incentive for @entity11 to have lied			0
she was n't seeking to tell her story in the first place ( the @entity5 reporter found her ) , and she must have known that she would face the usual victim shaming and blaming ( witness the slime " journalists " who have now published what they allege is @entity11 's full name and address )			1
indeed , while @entity11 named the fraternity involved , she left her alleged assailants ' names out of it , so it 's hard to see what sort of " revenge " agenda could be served by fabrication			0
no one , myself included , wants @entity11 's story to be true ( that 's absurd and offensive ) , but we can not apologize for erring on the side of a fair , compassionate and credulous hearing of a woman 's account			1
what feminists want -- as we all should -- is a culture in which it is safe for women to report sexual assault when it happens , where they can trust that their families , their peers , the police and courts and , yes , the media will respond with sensitivity and compassion , not skepticism and shame .			1

@entity259 : facts hazy on @entity7 rape allegations , but victim - blaming is back in the *mix*
she says poor @entity5 reporting gave some license to discredit notion of rape culture
she cites 4 incidents in past few years where bystanders did nothing to stop gang assaults
@entity259 : feminists do n't want @entity7 rape story to be true ; they want women to feel safe to tell of rape
