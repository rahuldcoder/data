-- as @entity2 and @entity3 negotiators prepare to implement their historic interim nuclear deal , a handful of hawkish lawmakers are on the cusp of destroying the last remaining pathway to peace			1
this month , sens. @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 introduced ill - timed legislation -- the @entity14 of 2013 -- that would implement new @entity3 sanctions in clear violation of the recently brokered @entity18 agreement			1
calling such actions in @entity21 " a major setback , " @entity3 foreign minister @entity19 used the opportunity to send a clear message to his @entity26 audience : " it shows a lack of understanding of how to proceed in order to resolve the nuclear issue			1
some people are wedded to the idea that pressure will produce results			2
pressure has produced 18,000 centrifuges in @entity3			1
so if they want to continue that road -- it is open to them , but it does n't produce any results			1
" @entity19 has a point			0
the problem with new sanctions legislation goes beyond the fact that it will kill the diplomatic process			2
perhaps more important , this destructive behavior does the opposite of what we really should be doing : empowering those in @entity3 who want to unclench their fist and meet the extended hand of the @entity2			1
supporters of sanctions legislation in @entity57 say their actions do not violate the @entity18 deal			2
instead , they are needed to retain the infrastructure of sanctions , because it was the sanctions that created this opening for diplomacy in the first place			0
this is a deep misread of how we got here and a very effective way of making sure this opportunity is lost			1
in a new report , " extending hands and @entity82 " ( @entity73 ) -- which relies on in - depth interviews with senior @entity3 political officials , intellectuals and members of business community -- the @entity79 shows that absent evidence , it is difficult to argue that @entity3 's shift to more moderate policies was a result of external sanctions			1
it is more plausible that this shift reflected the continued desire of the @entity3 people to put an end to the mismanagement and failed policies that had endured under the @entity96 government			1
the @entity3 people had pushed for the same shift in 2009 , before the imposition of " crippling sanctions , " but the hardliners resorted to fraud and repression to prevent their votes from being counted			1
in 2013 , circumstances on the ground in @entity3 bubbled over : seventy - three percent voter turnout propelled @entity107 to a landslide first - round presidential victory at the polls with 50.7 % of the vote			2
precisely because the wounds of 2009 were still open , divisions within the political elite remained unsettled , and the intense internal rifts suggested that the system simply could not survive the delegitimizing effects of another election scandal			0
these internal dynamics are a far more powerful -- and far less understood -- dynamic than any sanctions imposed from abroad			0
the same analysis that incorrectly predicted victory by hardliner and former chief nuclear negotiator @entity124 at the polls subsequently attributed @entity107 's victory to sanctions despite no concrete evidence in support of that assertion			0
on the contrary , a poll conducted by @entity132 and the @entity133 ( @entity73 ) immediately after the election revealed that only 2 % of @entity107 's supporters listed the lifting of sanctions as a reason for supporting him			2
twice as many -- 4 % -- voted for him because he was a clergyman			0
seven percent cited his ability to fix the economy			0
the poll also revealed that a key factor behind @entity107 's election was strategic voting by supporters of his rival , @entity152 mayor @entity150			0
since most voters expected the election to go to a runoff , many saw voting for their preferred candidate in the first round as a waste if they expected their top choice to be a shoo - in for the runoff			0
thus , some voters cast their ballots for their second choice in the first round to secure a runoff between two of their most preferred candidates			0
according to the poll , 24 % of @entity107 voters preferred @entity150 but were certain he would make it to the runoff and instead voted for @entity107 to ensure a runoff between these two candidates			0
thanks in part to this miscalculation , @entity107 managed to reach just above the 50 % threshold and evade a runoff			0
a more recent poll by @entity181 ( @entity73 ) conducted 1,200 face - to - face interviews in @entity3 , and the results were equally telling			1
a whopping 96 % said that maintaining the right to advance their nuclear program is worth the price being paid in economic sanctions and international isolation			0
in contrast , a paltry 7 % prioritized resolving the standoff over @entity3 's nuclear program so that economic sanctions can be lifted			1
perhaps more important , the @entity181 poll makes clear what intellectually honest @entity3 observers have long asserted : all top - tier priorities listed by @entity3 respondents were political or governmental reform issues , such as employment , advancing democracy , protecting personal and civil rights , increasing women 's rights and ending corruption			2
@entity3 voters know better than anyone that @entity107 's victory at the polls is fragile			2
boxing in their hardliners is not the same as eliminating them			0
what the outside world -- particularly the @entity211 -- does or does not do can help determine whether the win - win approach of @entity107 and @entity19 will define @entity3 or whether it will once again be relegated to the sidelines			2
thanks to the elections , not sanctions , the win - win narrative of the @entity3 moderates is now dominant			1
but it wo n't be for long if their corresponding policies do not prove successful			0
simply put : proponents of sanctions can deal with the flexibility of @entity107 's team now , or they can deal with the inflexibility of @entity3 hardliners in six months			1
knowing this , their choices in the days and weeks ahead will be telling			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 and @entity234 .			1

@entity233 and @entity234 say the @entity2 is misinterpreting the results of @entity3 election
they write that *threatening* more sanctions is the wrong way to go
continuing down this road will make sure this opportunity is lost , they say
