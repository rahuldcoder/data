@entity0 -- after a deal was hammered out by @entity5 leaders last week on a joint plan to help bail out @entity7 and bolster @entity9 banks , the world looked to @entity10 to help pick up the check			1
in a historical context , it 's a remarkable turn of events for @entity10 , which inside a generation has rocketed from isolation and poverty to become the world 's second largest economy behind the @entity20			1
but as @entity10 president @entity21 arrived in @entity9 to meet with other @entity23 leaders in @entity24 , it became increasingly clear that @entity0 was n't coming into town wearing a white hat to rescue debt - ridden eurozone nations			1
why is the @entity5 turning to @entity10 ? simply put , @entity0 has the money			1
the tumult in @entity7 is over austerity moves that would cut @entity7 services , reduce payback to @entity7 bondholders by as much 50 % and bolster loans to help @entity35 in $ 178 billion deal			0
the end goal of these measures would leave @entity7 with debt equaling 120 % of its total economic output by 2020			0
@entity10 , by contrast , is the largest holder of foreign currency reserves in the world with more than $ 3 trillion in its coffers and an economy whose annual growth rate hovers near 10 %			1
@entity9 leaders are hoping @entity0 will be a substantial contributor to the @entity52 , which under the deal hammered out last week would increase from 440 billion euros to 1 trillion euros ( $ 1.36 trillion )			1
but @entity10 vice finance minister @entity54 told reporters gathering in @entity24 ahead of the summit that it was " too soon " for @entity0 to say whether it would contribute to the fund			2
" the fund has not established details of its investment options so we still ca n't talk about the issue of investing , " he said			0
what 's in it for @entity10 ? the bloc of 17 nations united under the euro currency is @entity10 's largest trading partner , the destination for nearly 20 % of @entity10 goods exported in 2010 ; by comparison , 18 % of @entity10 exports were sent to the @entity20 , according to 2010 @entity76 figures			1
in july , eurozone trade to @entity10 surpassed the @entity20 for the first time to become the @entity5 's largest trading partner , according to @entity80			1
so an unstable @entity9 would undoubtedly hurt the fortunes of exporters here			0
still , any help would likely come with strings attached			0
though @entity20 lawmakers have led complaints that @entity10 unfairly manipulates the value of its currency , similar shouts have been heard from @entity9 officials			1
no doubt @entity0 would like to see those calls silenced			0
moreover , @entity10 wants the @entity5 to give it market economy status , which would reduce the tariffs for @entity10 products sold in the eurozone			2
@entity10 is scheduled to get market economy status by the @entity76 in 2016 , and observers say it 's likely the @entity5 will wait until then			1
" since eruption of the global financial crisis and the debt crisis in @entity9 , @entity10 has offered help to @entity9			1
for instance , @entity10 sent several delegations to @entity9 to purchase huge amounts of goods and services in 2009 , aiming to boost @entity9 's economy			1
since last year , @entity10 has purchased bonds of several @entity9 countries , trying to save nations deep in a debt crisis , " a commentary in @entity10 's state - run @entity109 said last month arguing for market economy status			1
" by contrast , it is a pity that the @entity5 side still shows no sincerity on the issue of recognizing @entity10 's market economy status , " it said			2
why is @entity10 reluctant to help ? there appears to be little domestic enthusiasm in @entity10 to run to the @entity5 's aid			1
" they keep pushing the anti-dumping thing and bullying @entity10 , and now we are helping them ? " one @entity0 man told @entity1 , referring to allegations that @entity10 " dumps " products in markets with unfair pricing			1
" i say we should not save them			0
" @entity10 perceive their currency reserve as a nest egg built on the back of 30 years hard work building its economy , said @entity140 of @entity141			0
" it 's a sensitive issue because @entity0 ca n't be seen to be just investing this money willy - nilly , " @entity140 said			0
" they need to make a case that they 're going to earn a reliable return			0
" economist @entity148 in @entity149 argues it 's not in @entity0 's " political , economic or strategic interest " to come to the @entity5 's aid			2
while some have argued a handout would be a way for @entity10 to increase its " soft power " abroad , @entity148 thinks such a move would backfire			0
" look at @entity7 -- they complain their country is being taken over by @entity161 bankers , " he said			0
" how do you think they will feel if @entity10 steps in ? the average person would n't look at this as aid , but as @entity10 coming in and taking us over			0
" and a slowdown in the @entity5 would hurt @entity10 , it would n't raise the specter of widespread unemployment , he added			2
" @entity10 's labor market is fully employed ... there are widespread shortages of manual labor			0
any economic slowdown ( from reduced @entity5 demand ) is not likely to see widespread unemployment			0
" even more of a signal that @entity0 will let the @entity5 solve its own problems			2
how @entity10 can really help others say that @entity10 's real opportunity to help is n't through bailing out @entity9 , but investing in the @entity5 and boosting domestic consumption of @entity9 products			1
" what the @entity9 lack is n't money , what they lack is growth , " said @entity140			0
" @entity10 can play an important role in saving @entity9 but not in the way that most people think			2
most people think the @entity9 are coming to @entity10 hat in hand hoping for bailout funds			2
" really the way that @entity10 can help @entity9 is not by continuing to run surpluses and turn around to use the proceeds to lend it back to @entity9 to keep them on life support			0
" the real way @entity10 can help @entity9 is by using some of that money , the $ 3 trillion worth of reserves they 've piled up to stimulate consumption ... and help create jobs , earnings and opportunity in @entity9 , " @entity140 said			1
@entity1 's @entity206 contributed to this story			0

@entity5 leaders are hopeful @entity10 will assist in funding the @entity9 debt plan
@entity10 has the world 's largest currency reserves with more than $ 3 trillion
@entity0 is reluctant to spend the reserves for fear of public backlash
" they keep pushing the anti-dumping thing and bullying @entity10 , and now we are helping them ? "
