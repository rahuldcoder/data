-- a tv series ' 100th episode signifies success and , in most cases , a profitable afterlife in syndication			1
shows like " @entity8 " and " friends " coasted past their centenary episodes , leaving fans wanting more			1
but it 's not just ratings juggernauts that reach the milestone			1
sometimes networks and viewers just do n't know when to let go			1
" @entity23 's " climactic 100th episode aired on monday , reminding dedicated fans why they 've held on for so long , and , by the same token , alerting former viewers of the show 's protracted life			1
" they can trot out a cake with 100 candles on it , but let 's be honest , ( ' @entity23 's ' ) ratings have been terrible for years , " said @entity24 , the features editor at @entity25			1
the @entity33 drama has n't attracted more than 1.5 million viewers during its monday night timeslot since the fifth season kicked off in september			1
during its first season , which premiered in 2007 , episodes of " @entity23 " routinely garnered more than 2 million viewers -- a feat for the younger - skewing network			1
and despite disappointing ratings , " @entity23 " executive producer @entity43 told @entity45 that they 're not writing a series finale anytime soon			1
" the actors ' contracts expire at the end of next season , so that feels like probably an organic ending point , " @entity43 said			0
if budding movie stars @entity54 and @entity56 ca n't deliver ratings , there 's a problem , @entity24 said			1
perhaps it 's because the series , based on @entity62 's novels of the same name , is n't playing hard to get			1
" @entity23 " does n't need 24 episodes each season , @entity24 said			1
networks can learn from the model employed by @entity69 's " @entity68 " and @entity71 's " @entity70 , " he added			2
they need to minimize the number of episodes airing each season			2
" some shows only need to last three seasons , " he said			0
" and some shows only need to have 10 episodes per season			2
users can handle that , but the networks ca n't			1
" the show 's creator , @entity83 , has taken heat for this in the past			1
his @entity89 drama " @entity90 " lasted four seasons -- just short of the 100 - episode mark -- before getting canceled in 2007			1
many viewers have argued that " the @entity90 's " jumping point occurred when @entity96 's character was killed off at the end of season 3			2
of course , it 's easy for a high quality show that 's won a ton of awards , like " @entity103 , " to go out on top , @entity24 said , adding , " other shows on network tv will try and wring out every dollar ... they possibly can			0
it 's always happened that way			0
" take , for example , @entity112 's " @entity111 " and " @entity113 " on @entity89 , he said			0
at one point , both shows dominated ratings and awards shows			0
now , with both programs currently in the midst of their eighth seasons , viewership has greatly diminished			0
after hitting a ratings rough patch last season , @entity112 's " @entity126 , " on the other hand , is currently experiencing a resurgence in its eighth season			2
many primetime soaps experience hills and valleys , @entity24 said			0
unfortunately for " @entity23 , " the next hill might be out of reach			2
" to wait five seasons before marrying @entity134 off and announcing who @entity23 is , you 've missed the boat , " he said			2
" they were starting to throw in these gimmicks too late in the game			0
" but the @entity33 , @entity83 and @entity43 have another trick up their sleeves			0
they 're working to bring " @entity144 " prequel " the @entity145 " to the small screen			0
@entity24 says only the really great shows will make it to syndication and last there			0
" @entity150 " and " @entity151 : @entity154 , " he said , " will forever be in syndication because people still tune into them			0
" a show like " @entity23 , " he added -- not so much			2
" there are too many options on tv			0
... and with people flipping around the @entity160 ... ratings have been dropping across the board , " he said			0
" there are shiny , bright new things out there to try			0

" @entity8 " and " friends " coasted past 100 episodes , leaving fans wanting more
" @entity23 's " 100th episode aired on monday , attracting about *1.4* million viewers
