@entity0 -- a @entity5 @entity4 chopper responding to a possibly distressed boater off the @entity8 coast was forced to make an emergency landing when the pilot was temporarily blinded by a laser , the service said			1
the scare on wednesday near @entity13 was the third time in as many weeks that @entity16 pilots in that area , called the @entity18 , have reported being disabled by sharp laser light			1
" we 've been very fortunate that the green laser incidents have n't yet resulted in tragedy , " @entity20			1
@entity23 of @entity24 said in a statement			0

following the emergency landing , another crew took over and continued the search			1

the @entity16 is working with police to try to find out who is responsible			2
the pilot in this case was grounded for 24 hours before being cleared to fly again			2
it is unclear what type of laser might have been used in this case			2
but reports by commercial and private pilots of laser incidents nationally have jumped in recent years as hand - held technology has become readily available and easily used			1
aviation safety officials and law enforcement are trying to curb the activity and are stepping up prosecutions			0
phony @entity53 calls vexing @entity16 @entity16 officials have deemed the @entity18 area of the @entity8 coast where pilots have reported lasers as very high risk , and now require crews to consider the possibility of a laser scenario before responding to a distress call			1
" every time we send our aircrews to the @entity18 , we 're telling them to fly into the equivalent of a storm , where it 's almost guaranteed they 'll be hit , " @entity23 said			0

@entity91 acting administrator @entity90 has said federal authorities will " aggressively " prosecute violators under a new law that makes laser targeting a federal crime , and will not treat incidents with warning notices or counseling			1
the @entity91 and the @entity100 are pushing for stiffer penalties against those responsible for targeting aircraft			0
since june last year , the @entity91 has started enforcement action against 28 people charged with aiming a laser device at an aircraft and has opened " dozens of additional cases " for investigation , the agency said			0
dealing with these incidents on top of an increase in false mayday calls have frustrated @entity16 officials			1
" the biggest downfall is that their night vision is ruined , and they 're flying blind			0
it 's dangerous for the pilots and the crew			0
their lives and the lives of the crew are at risk , " @entity16 lt. cmdr			2
