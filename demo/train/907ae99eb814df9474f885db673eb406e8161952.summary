-- no doubt about it , @entity1 have latched on to a red hot potato when it comes to the controversy of who - did - what - when in @entity9			1
the awful story of a terrible embassy attack , a botched aftermath and finger - pointing about what more could have been done has already been the subject of an exhaustive internal @entity16 investigation and congressional hearings			1
and the truth is that mistakes were made , everyone is somehow to blame and four people are dead who should not have died			2
it 's a terrible mess			2
it seemed to be settling down a bit until last week			2
that 's when the @entity16 -- after a request made under the @entity28 -- released a memo by a senior @entity31 adviser that tried to " underscore that these protests are rooted in an internet video , and not a broader policy failure			2
" republicans cried foul , especially when the @entity31 offered the weak explanation that the e-mail was not specifically about @entity9 but rather about the " general dynamic " of the @entity40 world at the time			1
never mind that it was written as then - @entity44 ambassador @entity43 was about to go on sunday shows to discuss the event			2
so now comes a congressional inquiry -- a new panel with 7 gopers and 5 @entity48			1
this time , it 's the @entity48 who are crying foul , and they 're threatening to boycott the committee			1
i get it : they believe it 's a witch hunt , and they do n't want to participate			0
why legitimize it ? why give it more credence ? why play into @entity1 hands ? here 's why : if you do n't participate , you ca n't defend			1
and if you ca n't defend -- or explain -- you lose			1
it 's as simple as that			0
this is what 's truly going on			0
this is a short - term political play by @entity1 that , they hope , could also have some long - term implications for @entity69 as a presidential candidate in 2016			1
after all , this happened on her watch as secretary of state			0
that job is one of the major line items on her resume			0
if the public 's assessment of that tenure is called into question , then the value of that job experience is diminished			0
but there 's a more immediate political play here			1
midterm elections are occasions for partisan mobilization , plain and simple			0
in presidential years , the candidates are about the business of persuading independent voters to give them a shot			1
in midterm elections , it 's about the partisans			0
of the 40 % of the electorate that generally shows up , almost no one is up for grabs			0
candidates just need to get their party 's loyalists to turn out			2
for @entity1 , @entity106 no. 1 : @entity107 ( or @entity108 )			1
motivator no. 2 : @entity9 ( or @entity69 )			1
so long as the economy keeps chugging along nicely , these issues become even more paramount			0
sure , there 's a danger of overreach			0
( see : @entity116 and impeachment			0
) but @entity1 are n't worried about that now , because their partisans are , well , partisan			1
this is a play for november			2
in presidential elections , there 's often a huge public appetite for a more forward - looking and affirmative candidate with a plan and a positive message and vision			0
they 're about partisan bloodletting			0
so if the @entity48 decide to boycott the committee , it 's at their own risk			1
they will lose out on the conversation , no matter how silly they think it is			2
they will be uninformed about witnesses , strategies , subpoenas			0
as @entity48 learned during their participation in the " @entity145 " investigation , access to documents is a plus			1
you can play the game the way you want , leak what you want , tell your own narrative with the facts as you see them			0
if the @entity48 boycott , they may see themselves taking the high road			1
trouble is , it could lead them nowhere			0

@entity161 : @entity1 in @entity162 name a committee to investigate @entity9
she says @entity48 would make a mistake if they go through with boycott of panel
political *subtext* of @entity9 probe is @entity1 effort to get voters to turn out in november , she says
@entity161 : if @entity48 skip the hearings , they lose their *influence* , access to evidence
