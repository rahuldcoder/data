in 2011 , i was on a panel , organized by the security company @entity2 , with two retired @entity4 directors , @entity5 and @entity6			1
during the course of our debate , i raised concerns , as the only non-american on the panel , that their plans and preferences for having the @entity4 secure cyberspace for the rest of us were not exactly reassuring			2
to this , @entity6 replied that i should not describe myself as " @entity18 " but rather " @entity19			0
" as jarring as his response was , the fact of the matter is when it comes to communications , he 's right			0
practically speaking , there is no border separating @entity18 from @entity29 telecommunications -- though that 's not true the other way around			2
primarily , this one - way dependence is a product of history and economics			0
@entity18 ' communications are inextricably connected to networks south of the border and subject to the laws and practices of the @entity29 over which we , as foreigners , have no say or control			2
for @entity19 citizens , the recent @entity4 scandal has touched off soul - searching discussions about the legality of mass surveillance programs , whether they violate the @entity50 of the @entity51 , and whether proper oversight and accountability exist to protect @entity19 citizens ' rights			2
opinion : massive spying on @entity29 is outrageous indeed , with respect to the case of @entity61 , @entity4 's secret set of tools used to collect data about overseas internet communications , some argue the program actually enhances those safeguards for @entity29 -- because it appears that collection of company data was segregated in such a way to limit the collection to " foreign citizens			1
" as reassuring as this may be for @entity29 , for the rest of us non-americans who enjoy our @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity81 accounts , it 's definitely unsettling : we 're all fair game			1
while cyberspace may be global , its infrastructure most definitely is not			2
for example , a huge proportion of global internet traffic flows through networks controlled by the @entity29 , simply because eight of 15 global tier 1 telecommunications companies are @entity19 -- companies like @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and , significantly , @entity96			1
the social media services that many of us take for granted are also mostly provided by giants headquartered in the @entity29 , like @entity100 , @entity81 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
all of these companies are subject to @entity29 law , including the provisions of the @entity105 , no matter where their services are offered or their servers located			0
having the world 's internet traffic routed through the @entity29 and having those companies under its jurisdiction give @entity29 national security agencies an enormous home - field advantage that few other countries enjoy			1
but there are unintended consequences of the @entity4 scandal that will undermine @entity29 foreign policy interests -- in particular , the " @entity121 " agenda espoused by the @entity119 and its allies			1
opinion : your biggest secrets are up for grabs the revelations that have emerged will undoubtedly trigger a reaction abroad as policymakers and ordinary users realize the huge disadvantages of their dependence on @entity29 - controlled networks in social media , cloud computing , and telecommunications , and of the formidable resources that are deployed by @entity29 national security agencies to mine and monitor those networks			1
for example , in 2012 , @entity140 lawmakers debated a ban on the use by public officials of @entity100 's and @entity146 's cloud computing services			0
although shelved temporarily , this type of debate will almost certainly be resurrected and spread throughout @entity149 and other regions as the full scope of @entity29 - based " foreign directed " wiretapping and metadata collection sinks in			0
already we can see regional traffic to the @entity29 from @entity157 , @entity158 and even @entity159 gradually declining , a trend that is almost certainly going to accelerate as those regions ramp up regional network exchange points and local services to minimize dependence on networks under @entity29 control			1
many of the countries in the @entity168 are failed or fragile states ; many of them are authoritarian or autocratic regimes			0
no doubt the elites in those regimes will use the excuse of security to adopt more stringent state controls over the internet in their jurisdictions and support local versions of popular social media companies over which they can exact their own nationalized controls -- a trend that began prior to the @entity4 revelations but which now has additional rhetorical support			0
in the age of @entity189 , the revelations about @entity4 's intelligence - gathering programs touched many nerves			1
the issue of surveillance wo n't go away , and @entity29 will need to figure out the appropriate safeguards for liberty in their democracy			0
it 's an important debate , but one that does n't include us " foreigners " that now make up the vast majority of the internet users			0
@entity29 would do well to consider the international implications of their domestic policies before they come home to bite them .			1

@entity208 : for non-americans , @entity4 's massive surveillance is unsettling
@entity208 : while cyberspace may be global , its infrastructure most definitely is not
he says much of global @entity176 traffic flows through networks controlled by the @entity29
@entity208 : @entity29 needs to *rethink* the global implications of its domestic surveillance policies
