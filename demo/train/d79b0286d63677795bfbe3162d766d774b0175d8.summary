-- @entity2 theater shooting suspect @entity1 will wear a hidden harness under his clothes to restrain him during his trial , which will have the largest jury pool in state history			1
@entity1 is accused of killing 12 people and wounding dozens more in an @entity10 movie theater			1
he will wear the harness , which will be anchored to the floor , because of the violent nature of his alleged crimes , a judge said			2
judge @entity16 will send out 5,000 jury summons and expects at least 3,200 people will end up in court , he ruled on thursday			1
that would mean each of the 450,000 @entity24 residents eligible for jury duty would have a 1 in 90 chance of being called , for this one case alone , court spokesman @entity20 told @entity0			1
the idea is to bring in 800 prospective jurors at a time on thursdays and fridays early next year , a process that @entity20 says could take three to four weeks			0
those thousands will be winnowed down to 12 men and women for the start of the trial , which is set to begin february 3			1
it is expected to last four months			0
judge accepts theater shooting suspect 's insanity plea asking more people than usual to come to court for high - profile cases is common in the @entity44 justice system , given concerns many of them already know the story and have strong opinions about it			1
in @entity51 , for example , there was a 500 - person jury pool for the now - ongoing murder trial of @entity54 , who is accused in the killing of teenager @entity56 -- a case that drew national headlines for weeks			1
so too , of course , did what happened just after midnight the night of july 20 , 2012 , in the @entity61 suburb of @entity10			0
it was then and there , authorities say , that a man walked through an exit door into a crowded @entity68 movie complex as a late - night premiere of the @entity71 sequel " @entity72 " played			0
the former neuroscience graduate student wore all - black , a ballistic helmet , a tactical ballistic vest , protective leggings , a throat and groin protector , and a gas mask , police say			0
and he carried an arsenal that included two glock handguns , an ar - 15 rifle , a shotgun and 6,295 rounds of ammunition , @entity82 agent @entity81 has testified			0
" he did n't care who he killed , " prosecutor @entity89 told a judge during a preliminary court hearing in january , adding @entity1 chose his venue carefully to cage his victims			1
" he intended to kill them all			0
" after the carnage and @entity1 ' subsequent capture outside the theater , he was charged with 166 counts of murder , attempted murder and weapons violations			2
rescue workers were n't prepared for chaos of @entity10 shooting since his arrest , much of the in - court discussion has resolved around @entity1 ' mental state			2
judge @entity16 earlier this month accepted the defense 's plea of not guilty by reason of insanity			0
he was then taken to the @entity115 in @entity116 for evaluation , and is expected to be back in @entity118 on august 2			0
prosecutors in @entity24 announced in april they would seek the death penalty			0
despite the notoriety of the mass shooting , the judge ruled thursday that the empaneled jury will not be sequestered , as @entity1 ' defense team requested			1
making it so they could n't go home throughout the prolonged trial , @entity16 said , was an " unnecessarily drastic , expensive and impractical remedy that ... will create an extreme and undue hardship for jurors			0
" the judge also ruled against the defense 's attempt to prevent jurors from using phones or computers , barring their use in court but saying preventing them from using them outside is " unreasonable and unfair			2
" one thing jurors wo n't be able to see is restraints on @entity1			1
as someone accused of " multiple violent crimes , " @entity16 says that @entity1 must be restrained carefully during his trial			2
but the judge said he need n't wear handcuffs or shackles			2
instead , the judge ruled , @entity1 will " wear a harness under his clothing which will not be visible to the jury " and will be anchored to the floor			1
@entity0 's @entity156 contributed to this report .			0
