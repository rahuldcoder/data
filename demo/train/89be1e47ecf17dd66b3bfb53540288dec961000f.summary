-- the @entity2 @entity1 for now has blocked @entity3 from implementing its voter identification law			2
after a federal appeals court upheld the law earlier this week , a coalition of private groups had asked the high court to intervene on an emergency basis , complaining the newly - implemented procedures could cause confusion , causing many voters to either not bother to cast a ballot or be mistakenly turned away at the polls			1
the order issued thursday evening was opposed by justices @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
" it is particularly troubling that absentee ballots have been sent out without any notation that proof of photo identification must be submitted , " said @entity17			0
the state had argued the law reduces voter fraud and promotes accurate record - keeping , saying that producing a government - issued photo identification , such as a driver 's license , would not unduly inconvenience most citizens			2
@entity3 officials have not announced their next steps to comply with the high court 's one - page order			1
the issue could affect the gubernatorial race between incumbent @entity40 gov. @entity40 , who backs voter id , and his @entity43 challenger @entity42			1
the @entity3 cases are @entity45 ( @entity46 ) and ( @entity47 )			0
meantime in @entity49 , a judge struck down that state 's voter id law , saying it would disenfranchise minority voters and therefore could not be implemented			1
" we are extremely pleased with today 's ruling , a ruling that was compelled by the facts of this case			0
following a two - week trial that included testimony from nearly 40 witnesses , @entity49 failed to identify a single instance of in - person voter fraud -- the purported justification for @entity49 's photo id law , " said @entity58 , president and director - counsel of the @entity60 , the nation 's leading civil rights law firm and a separate entity from the @entity60			1
" @entity70 today effectively ruled that racial discrimination simply can not spread to the ballot box			0
" the office of state attorney general @entity74 said in a statement it would appeal " and urge the @entity76 ( federal court ) to resolve this matter quickly to avoid voter confusion in the upcoming election			0
the @entity2 @entity1 has already ruled that voter id laws are constitutional so we are confident the @entity49 law will be upheld on appeal			2
" @entity2 attorney general @entity84 lauded both the @entity3 and @entity49 decisions			0
" this @entity87 will never yield in its commitment to protecting that most sacred of @entity2 ' rights -- the right to vote , " he said in a statement .			0
