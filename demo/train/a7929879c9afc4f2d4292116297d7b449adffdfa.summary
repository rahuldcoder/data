-- as one woman in glittering @entity2 gently bends her legs backwards over her head , another balances on top , slowly twisting her own limbs into a human pretzel			0
they move as one -- a fantastical insect bewitching the @entity13 crowds in @entity15 's legendary stage show , called simply " @entity16 " but despite their ethereal demeanor , each petite performer possesses a rare herculean strength and snake - like flexibility			1
and almost all hail from one country : @entity25			1
" when you want a top baseball player , sometimes you look in @entity28			0
where we need a contortionist we look to @entity25 , " said the show 's artistic director , @entity29			1
" when they dance they have a natural flexibility , even in their folk dance			0
it is just part of their culture to have this extra bend in delivery with their movement			0
" why @entity25 ? the bright lights of @entity13 are a long way from the plains of @entity25 , a sparsely populated country bordering @entity49 and @entity50			1
but in the last 70 years , @entity25 has become a breeding ground for the world 's top contortionists , who have performed everywhere from @entity50 's @entity55 to the @entity56			1
indeed , while other well - meaning parents around the world might send their little girls to ballet or piano lessons , in @entity25 they 're more likely to drop them off at contortion school			1
watch : the art of contortion while @entity25 contortion has some similarities to ancient folk dances and yoga poses , it was the launch of the @entity71 in the 1940s that saw it really take off as a professional art form			2
when the contortion school 's first official trainer , the now legendary @entity76 , began performing across the country , she quickly inspired a generation of girls hoping to quite literally mold themselves in her likeness			0
one of those children was then - eight - year - old @entity84 , now the trainer for @entity15 's " @entity16 " " we 'd never seen anything like @entity76 before , " she said			1
" it was her combination of strong technical skills and the beautiful way she moved to the music -- she made it look so easy			0
" after that , every little girl wanted to be a contortionist			0
" child 's play of course , training to be a contortionist is far from easy			0
students as young as five train for around three hours a day , five days a week			1
they build up their strength , flexibility and balance through various exercises such as handstands , splits , and push - ups			0
" my homework was 300 push - ups a day , " said 29 - year - old @entity107 , former contortionist and @entity109 director at the @entity110 of @entity25			1
but by eight years old i could do most of the technical moves -- i was considered a professional			0
" there are some risks -- @entity107 suffered a knee injury after falling from a human tower three meters high			0
but many contortionists insist that much like any sport , it is safe if done properly			0
" @entity124 is not dangerous , " said 55 - year - old @entity15 trainer @entity84			2
" it 's like yoga -- if you 're stretching every day you stay young			2
" naturally gifted ? such rigorous training regimes have been a huge factor in the @entity25 ' success around the world			1
but how much of a role does genetics play ? " some people are naturally more flexible and this is often due to genetics -- if one of our parents is flexible , we 're more likely to be flexible too , " said @entity134 of the @entity135			0
" that said , a naturally flexible person would not be able to get themselves into positions that contortionists can without extensive training -- it is only very gradually , over many months and years , that the ligaments and muscles lengthen , allowing the joints to become more mobile			2
" world of opportunity for many youngsters in @entity25 , contortion is seen as more than simply a hobby -- it 's a golden ticket to the world			1
" @entity25 contortion is globally competitive -- today many performers work for @entity15 and other international circus companies , " said @entity107 , who also researched the history of @entity25 contortion at the @entity160			1
" that is why so many girls would like to become contortionists and travel around world and make living from it			2
" so what is it about these mysterious performers that continues to beguile audiences across the world ? @entity84 perhaps summed up their allure best : " it 's the realization that an individual can do things that seem impossible			2
