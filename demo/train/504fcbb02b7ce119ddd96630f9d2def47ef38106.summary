-- lawyers for @entity2 will face off against those with @entity4 in a @entity6 federal court monday after the animal rights group filed a lawsuit to declare that five killer whales are being held in slavery or involuntary servitude in violation of the 13th amendment			1
@entity4 has called the lawsuit a baseless publicity stunt by @entity2 , which is known for provocative advertisements and public demonstrations on behalf of animal rights			1
@entity2 filed the 20 - page compalint in october on behalf of the whales -- @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
a @entity2 statement at the time contended that constitutional protections against slavery are not limited to humans			1
" plaintiffs were forcibly taken from their families and natural habitats , are held captive at @entity37 and @entity38 , denied everything that is natural to them , subjected to artificial insemination or sperm collection to breed performers for defendants ' shows , and forced to perform , all for defendants ' profit , " the lawsuit states , arguing that those conditions amount to enslavement and / or forced servitude			0
at the heart of the lawsuit is the question of whether a non-human entity can sue for a violation of constitutional rights			1
the 13th @entity13 outlaws slavery and " involuntary servitude " in the @entity57 without any specific mention that it applies only to people			2
" neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the @entity57 , or any place subject to their jurisdiction , " the amendment 's first section states			2
in its statement , @entity2 called the lawsuit " the first ever seeking to apply the @entity13 to non-human animals			1
" the lawsuit seeks an order for the release of the whales " from bondage " and a permanent order against holding them in slavery , as well as appointment of a legal guardian to carry out the transfer of the whales to a suitable habitat			2
it also seeks attorneys ' fees and costs			0
in a statement responding to the lawsuit , @entity88 said in october that the court case challenges " the public 's right to enjoy and learn more about marine mammals			0
" " this effort to extend the @entity13 's solemn protections beyond human beings is baseless and in many ways offensive , " the statement said			0
@entity4 is " among the world 's most respected zoological institutions , " it continues , adding that @entity4 parks " are fully accredited by the @entity102 and the @entity103 " with legal permission to display marine mammals			0
" @entity2 has once again showed that it prefers publicity stunts to the hard work of caring for , rescuing and helping animals , " the @entity4 statement said			1
state and federal courts have traditionally understood laws dealing with animal ownership and cruelty as applying only to human actions , meaning the animals themselves could neither be prosecuted nor act as plaintiffs or defendants			0
that would include litigation and legislation involving hunting and breeding of animals and plants , as well as zoo and circus displays			0
@entity0 's @entity131 and @entity132 contributed to this report .			0
