gets an alien 's attention in " @entity13			1
" but the alien - infested " @entity13 , " opening in theaters friday , takes things in a different direction -- if the producer may say so himself			1
" it 's utterly original , " producer @entity19 -- yes , " @entity20 " helmsman @entity19 -- told @entity21			0
" in an industry that 's looking to make movies out of every obscure tv show , or sequels , or video games , you look at ' @entity13 ' and it 's unlike anything you 've ever seen , " he said			1
with its inventive plot and crowd - pleasing special effects , the low - profile , relatively low - budget ( $ 30 million , a pittance these days ) film was a hit at @entity38 , creating a buzz before the film 's release			1
the brainchild of newcomer @entity43 , " @entity13 " is a mash - up of the director 's love for science fiction with his rearing in an apartheid - divided @entity48			1
set and shot in the shantytowns of @entity52 , the film is a mix of action - movie shock and sociological food for thought			1
the mayhem begins when an alien spaceship runs out of fuel over @entity48 in 1981 , and simply hovers idly in the sky			1
with no attack forthcoming , officials finally evacuate a group of aliens -- it turns out they 've fled their home world -- and corral them into barbed - wire ghettos , effectively separating the shrimp - like creatures from the human populace			1
overseeing the aliens ' camp is the corporation @entity13 ( @entity13 )			1
it 's an obvious nod to @entity48 's own violent and divisive history , but director @entity43 says he is n't aiming for political commentary			1
" this is an organic thing that has grown out of me living in @entity48			2
i did n't want to go , ' here 's a whole bunch of people that have been oppressed by this apartheid-esque society ' and beat people over the head with it , " he told @entity0			0
" i wanted to say , ' this is the city i grew up in , and this is what it felt like , ' with a science fiction veneer to it so that it does n't take itself that seriously			0
" documentary - like authenticity was of prime importance to @entity43 , and was the reason for his casting of fellow @entity48 unknown @entity10 as leading man			1
@entity10 has no prior acting experience , but critics have lauded his portrayal of @entity99 , a private - sector employee who goes from being the oppressor to one of the oppressed after an accidental run - in with some @entity104 - transforming alien goo			2
" having grown up in @entity48 , i was exposed to the tail end of apartheid as a child , [ and ] it 's something i felt i could relate to , " @entity10 said			1
" playing the character , i saw so clearly how you discriminate			0
... the film deals with things that are fundamentally human			2
" " @entity13 " is also fundamentally a thriller , and there 's no shortage of gory , gritty scenes and clever special effects that will appeal to fans who like a little action with their sci - fi			1
indeed , the film has been praised for its masterful use of special effects , weaving the technology seamlessly into the documentary - style scenes			1
sometimes the two are in the very same shot , @entity43 said			0
" one of the first shots completed was a motherboard shot , where [ computer - generated imagery ] was incorporated into some of the handheld footage , and it felt like it was working , this idea of handheld stuff with [ @entity138 ] , " @entity43 said			2
" it set a good tone ; it captured the essence of what i was going for			0
" not bad for a 29 - year - old novice , who had previously directed short films and commercials			2
but that body of work was impressive enough to catch the eye of a-list producer @entity19 , who originally had @entity43 in mind for feature version of @entity153 , the video game			0
" [ @entity19 ] had received all of the crazy short films and commercials i had done , and once i met him and hung out and got familiar with the kind of filmmaking universe he set up down there , he did sign off on me as director of ' @entity153 , ' " @entity43 recalled			0
but , five months into the project , the plug was pulled on " @entity153			0
" " right away , [ @entity19 ] said , ' if you want , you can stay in @entity165 and we can just keep the momentum going and allow another film to take place , ' " @entity43 said			2
one of @entity43 's friends suggested his short film , " alive in @entity52 , " for feature treatment			2
@entity43 ran with the concept , developing it alongside fellow screenwriter @entity175 into " @entity13			2
" " it 's pretty cool , " @entity43 said			0
" i would 've packed my bags and left had [ @entity19 ] not said that			0
" it 's been more than two years since @entity43 started the project , and though he 's found the experience exhausting , he has quite a final product to show off			0
" there is nothing better than to come out the end of that process and have it play in a movie theater , " he said			0
" for that first film , i got what i had set out to do , [ and ] that 's a pretty awesome feeling			0
" @entity0 's @entity191 contributed to this story .			0
