-- to look at an ancient globe is to look at the @entity2 as it was seen by the people of another time			2
it reflects their understanding of the continents and seas , and it captures political divisions that have long since shifted			2
even the typography and colors of a globe are indicative of the time and place of its origin , says @entity19 , a @entity20 - based conservator of ancient globes			1
often , it 's a thing of remarkable craftsmanship and beauty			0
" if you go into a room and there 's a globe , your attention is immediately drawn to it , " @entity19 said			1
in her lavishly illustrated new book , @entity31 : 400 years of exploration , navigation , and power , @entity19 traces the history and making of globes and showcases dozens of fine examples drawn largely from the collection of the @entity40			1
contrary to the popular misconception that nobody knew the @entity2 was round before @entity44 , the ancient @entity41 described the making of globes ( in verse , no less ) in the third century @entity49 the oldest surviving globe dates back to 150 a.d. but they really took off between about 1500 and 1900 , and it 's this period that 's the focus of @entity31			1

for one thing , any globe that 's small enough to be brought on board would have to be scaled down to the point of being useless for charting a course on the high seas			0
" they 're more a symbol of navigation than a tool for navigation , " she said			1
in the book , she writes that in the 17th century , globes were sold as " handsome objects of status and prestige to a comfortable merchant class			1
" not that ancient globes do n't convey some useful information			2
much of it is contained in the horizon ring that surrounds many of them			0
@entity82 circles printed or engraved on the ring indicate the degrees of the compass , the months of the year , zodiac signs , and sometimes information about winds			0
they can be used , for example , to determine the sunrise and sunset on a given day of the year , @entity19 says			1
" most of the globes were like little calculating machines			2

" the constellations were very much used for navigational purposes , " @entity19 says , so being able to study pairs like this would have been very instructive for mariners in training			1

" they 're just delightful little things , " she said			0
the smallest is just 1.5 inches in diameter			0

the concave surface of the case often contains a matching celestial globe			0
