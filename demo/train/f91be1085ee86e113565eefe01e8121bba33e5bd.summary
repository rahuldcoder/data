-- at 35,000 feet , the orange glow of a @entity3 sunrise begins to pierce the horizon from beneath a tufted layer of clouds			2
unfortunately , it will be only a matter of minutes before that glow transforms into a pupil - penetrating annoyance through the windscreen of our 777			2
the irritating glare wo n't , of course , affect the way we navigate our way to @entity18 's @entity17 ; a complicated and well - engineered computer system using gps positioning provides information to air traffic controllers			1
but what if this well - oiled machine breaks down ? do we need to start worrying ? that was a question facing pilots in airspace over the @entity28 on friday , when @entity29 , a part of the @entity28 's @entity32 system of air traffic control , developed a computer glitch			1
@entity35 is the airspace that most flights transit to or from not only @entity28 , but also from @entity38 and other @entity3 countries , covering airspace from south of @entity42 to north of the @entity43 , and just west of @entity38 to almost the middle of the @entity45			1
so when @entity35 develops a computer glitch , air traffic arriving and departing into the @entity28 is most affected			1
but while a malfunction affecting the flight of objects hurtling through the sky at 600 mph might sound scary , rest assured that @entity53 celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary are n't at any risk of colliding with another airliner en route			1
it just means they might be a little late arriving for their vacation			2
airplanes that are already airborne receive priority by virtue of the fact controllers understand that only a finite amount of fuel remains in the tanks			2
as airline pilots , it becomes a matter of calculating whether our fuel on board is sufficient to fly a few circles in a holding pattern or divert to our alternate airport			0
traditional radar is still available once the flight travels in range of a land - based facility			0
departures , however , will be delayed until the situation is rectified or mitigated			0
so , why is n't there a risk of collision ? as it has been since the days of the @entity88 , the track system is a nonradar environment			1
radar signals do n't have the capability of traveling out to the middle of the ocean , so before airplanes enter the @entity45 track system , from either east or west , a specific speed is assigned along with a specific altitude			1
in other words , airplanes are separated both vertically and laterally based on their known performance			0
this is still the case			0
before the latest computer technology became prevalent , oceanic controllers would track airplanes manually based on verbal pilot position reports at designated degrees of longitude			1
with the advent of more precise navigation , more precise onboard automation and more exact ground - based air traffic control systems , the separation limits have decreased , allowing for more flights between @entity114 and @entity3			1
all this means that airplanes can still maintain this separation even if the ground - based oceanic computers take a temporary vacation			0
how ? because we are required to maintain our assigned altitude and our assigned airspeed			0
and since the actual tracks change daily according to weather and winds , the performance of all the participating airplanes will be affected exactly the same			0
when the current technology system breaks down , the solution is either to increase separation limits or just wait until it is fixed			1
verbal position reports would be required because our onboard ads - b system would n't be able to communicate with the particular oceanic facility			2
unfortunately , stopping departures that will be transiting the airspace is the simplest solution rather than temporarily resorting back to the old methods -- hence the delays on departing flights that were experienced friday			1
this of course raises the question of whether the global air traffic control system has become computer dependent			1
the simple answer is , absolutely			0
but it is also worth remembering that the technology has also increased efficiency			0
and , more importantly , it has added another degree of safety to air travel			2
with all that in mind , we are just going to have to suffer through the compromise of inconvenience when the technology breaks down			0
or find another way to get to our intended destinations .			0

air traffic control system for @entity18 airspace has technical *failure* friday
@entity167 : malfunction was inconvenient , not *dangerous*
