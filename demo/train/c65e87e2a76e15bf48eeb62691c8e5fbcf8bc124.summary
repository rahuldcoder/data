-- almost everything that can be said about tuesday night 's elections has been said , so with some trepidation , a few afterthoughts : the verdicts in the 2014 midterm races make it clear that president @entity6 can not simply blame @entity9 losses on a bad map , as he did tuesday			1
( the president passed off the elections as taking place in states least favorable for @entity9 " since @entity15			2
" ) it should be sobering for the @entity17 that when @entity6 took office , @entity9 had 59 senators and 256 @entity17 members ; after tuesday night , they will likely have 45 - 47 senators and some 190 @entity17 members			1
that is one of the biggest slides in congressional seats of any modern president			2
surely , his @entity17 has to take serious responsibility -- and look for ways to leave a better legacy			0
this was an unexpectedly big night for the @entity32 : predictions for @entity32 were already high , but they blew the doors off			2
who could have imagined republicans winning the governorships of @entity38 and @entity39 , winning @entity41 seats in @entity6 states such as @entity42 and @entity43 , and assembling their biggest coalition in the @entity45 since the 1940s			0
conservatives will likely disagree , but one takeaway for @entity32 is that they were well served this year by recruiting conservatives whom voters saw as less hard right than the tea party			2
look at @entity52 of @entity42 : the @entity32 establishment intentionally promoted him as an alternative in @entity42 who -- unlike @entity55 , a tea partyer who lost a few years ago ( but won the conservative 4th @entity58 this year ) -- would appeal to moderates as well as conservatives			1
even the @entity62 endorsed him -- just as the @entity63 endorsed @entity32 @entity64 , who wrested the @entity65 from @entity9			1
a bright spot from tuesday night that needs more attention : the @entity68 at @entity69 reports @entity70 will now have at least 100 women in @entity72 -- a three-fold increase over 25 years			1
women such as @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 also won pivotal @entity41 races			0
past experience says that the more women leaders in @entity72 , the more likely the two sides will find common ground			1
tuesday night also witnessed the election of a fourth generation of the @entity86 family elected to public office			1
@entity86 , the son of @entity88 , won statewide office in @entity90 as land commissioner			2
his great - grandfather was @entity93 , a @entity70 senator ( and almost @entity15 's vice presidential running mate ) ; his grandfather was president @entity97 ; his father was governor of @entity99 and his uncle was president			0
will his dad now declare his own candidacy for the presidency ? tuesday night 's results probably make it more likely			0
for this observer , this election night was especially sweet because of the breakthrough victory by a young man i have known and supported for 15 years : @entity112 , a @entity113 who swept to a double - digit victory as a new congressman from the @entity116 of @entity39			0
@entity112 has three degrees from @entity118 and four tours in @entity120 as a @entity122 infantry officer			0
more than that , he is a model among a rising generation of leaders who i believe can transform our politics			0
i wrote about him and others of his generation in a recent column on @entity0			0
congratulations , @entity112 ! ( note : an earlier version of this article said there will be at least 100 women in the @entity17 ; that number applies to the entire @entity72			1

@entity139 : president has to find *shrinking* @entity9 ranks in @entity72 sobering
@entity139 says @entity32 were smart in their choice of more moderate candidates this year
at least 100 women will serve in @entity72 , a threefold increase over 25 years
@entity139 : here comes another generation of the @entity86 family in public office
