-- president @entity2 soon will nominate a new director of national intelligence , a position originally envisioned as overseer of the entire @entity6 intelligence community			1
@entity7 , a retired @entity8 admiral , resigned as @entity2 's intelligence director thursday			2
in the days before his resignation , @entity7 had responded to a @entity13 committee report 's criticism by saying that " institutional and technological barriers remain that prevent seamless sharing of information " among the 16 agencies he oversaw			0
and that 's the problem , a former @entity22 homeland security adviser said friday			0
@entity24 , a @entity0 contributor who was a homeland security adviser during the @entity28 administration , said the director 's position lacks the authority to match its responsibilities			1
" they either have to fix it or do away with it , but one way or another , what we do n't need it to be is just an added layer of bureaucracy that impedes progress , especially when we have such serious threats out there , " @entity24 said on @entity0 's " @entity42			0
" @entity45 created the position in 2004 as part of an intelligence overhaul recommended by the @entity49			1
@entity50 , ambassador to @entity51 , became the first director in april 2005 and held the position until february 2007 , when he became deputy secretary of state			1
@entity56 @entity55 , a retired @entity8 vice admiral , succeeded @entity50 and served until a week after president @entity2 's inauguration , when @entity7 took over			1
according its website , " the @entity58 of the @entity60 's goal is to effectively integrate foreign , military and domestic intelligence in defense of the homeland and of @entity6 interests abroad			1
" however , the legislation that created the post did not invest it with authority to direct the budgets of any of the 16 intelligence agencies or tell them what to do			0
before the director position was created , the director of central intelligence called most of the shots , and @entity78 directors have continued to wield considerable power , generating tension with the @entity60			1
time : position not well defined or well rewarded " anytime you have organizations that have similar interests , you 're going to have disputes , " @entity82 said on his way out the door			0
" and particularly if the two leaders are n't working together and having a partnership and so on , the warfare at the trench level gets to be pretty much a raging battle			0
" @entity82 said he had a good professional relationship with then - @entity78 director @entity97 , so they made it work			1
but , he said , " we do n't have a department of intelligence			0
if this were the @entity106 , there would n't be any question , but it is n't			0
" @entity7 's resignation is said to be the result of a power struggle with @entity78 director @entity112			1
but even @entity112 seemed unclear on the intelligence hierarchy during his @entity13 confirmation hearing in 2009			0
initially , @entity112 said he reported to the @entity60 and performed the tasks assigned to him by the @entity60 , but then he said : " we are an operational arm , just like the [ @entity118 ] , just like the [ @entity58 ] , and i believe the role of the @entity60 is to coordinate all our activities			2
" in fact , the @entity118 and the @entity58 are part of the @entity106 and report directly to the defense secretary , not the @entity60			2
the @entity78 is the only intelligence agency that is not part of another department			2
sen. @entity126 , @entity127 , asked him directly , " is the @entity60 your boss or not ? " " the @entity60 is my boss , " @entity112 answered			2
@entity0 national security producer @entity132 and writer @entity133 contributed to this report .			0

job was created on recommendation of @entity49
@entity78 director answers to @entity60 on paper , but not in practice
