-- referee @entity1 was understood to have been smuggled out of @entity2 by police after receiving a number of death threats following his officiating of the @entity8 semifinal second leg between @entity9 and @entity10 -- according to the @entity12 @entity11			1
@entity1 's refereeing of the semifinal between @entity9 and @entity10 has proved controversial			1
@entity12 police were said to be so concerned about his safety they changed his hotel before organizing his secret exit while , in @entity1 's home city of @entity22 , police said they were investigating threats made on the internet			1
an @entity22 police spokesman told @entity27 : " we are watching closely what is being posted on the internet			0
anything we believe would threaten his personal safety will be taken seriously			0
" following the reports , @entity9 released a statement making clear they condemned any form of threat against players , officials or supporters			2
bad decisions or bad losers ? - join the debate the statement on the club 's web site confirmed @entity9 would take the strongest action possible against any season ticket holders or members who were proven to have participated in threatening activity , but stressed that no evidence had been received implicating @entity9 fans			1
four years ago @entity53 referee @entity52 retired after receiving death threats following his sending - off of @entity9 striker @entity55 in a @entity8 game against @entity10			1
@entity9 issued a statement condemning the actions of those who had abused @entity52 at the time			1
meanwhile , controversy still surrounds @entity9 's exit from this year 's competition , with @entity65 striker @entity55 confronting referee @entity66 after the game			1
however , @entity9 and @entity2 captain @entity68 felt that @entity55 had been justified to act in the way he did			1
" i am fully behind @entity55 for the way he reacted , " @entity68 told @entity11			1
" the man wants to win			0
you can see the passion that he played with during the game and the passion afterwards			0
" the 28 - year - old slammed the @entity78 referee and accused @entity79 of making a mistake by appointing @entity66 to referee the semifinal second leg			2
@entity9 looked to have set - up a repeat of last year 's @entity8 final against @entity84 before @entity86 93rd minute equaliser saw the @entity87 through on away goals			2
but it was @entity66 's performance that left @entity68 and his @entity9 team - mates fuming after the @entity78 refused to award @entity9 two spot - kicks in the first half when @entity94 and @entity55 were both brought down			1
then , in the second half , he turned down two handball penalty appeals after @entity99 handled as @entity100 tried to go past him and in the final seconds , after @entity86 's leveller , @entity96 's shot hit @entity104 's arm			2
@entity96 was so incensed he protested alongside the referee for 40 yards before getting a yellow card			2
@entity0 's @entity108 : " @entity10 deserved to win " - do you agree ? @entity55 , who had been substituted in the second half , then confronted the official after the game and received a yellow card for his protest before yelling an obscenity straight at the tv cameras			1
" it is difficult when players are so high on emotions after the game and people were saying in the tv studios that we should n't be reacting the way we did , " added @entity68			2
" that 's impossible after having six or seven decisions go against you at home in front of your own fans			2
i 've seen them all and two were clear penalties and you do n't get one			0
how are you supposed to feel ? " it 's a shambles really			0
players dream of playing in these finals but we ca n't through bad refereeing			0
we get a referee who has refereed 10 @entity8 games in his career and for him to be given the semifinal at @entity144 is not good enough			0
" not one player made a mistake over the two legs but we come away with a referee making four or five big errors and now we are out of the competition			0
maybe that referee would have been good enough in the group stages of the @entity8 but on a big stage , with a big game and big players , he simply was n't good enough			0
" @entity55 has since apologized for his behavior in a statement on @entity9 's official web site			1
" i was very upset at what happened during the game , but having seen the pictures on tv i accept that i overreacted , " said @entity55			2
the statement continued : " i also accept that the language i used did not set a good example for those watching at home , especially children			0
i regret that in the heat of the moment i let out my incredible frustration and disappointment in this way , and for that i apologize			0
" @entity9 also released a statement praising @entity55 's apology and claiming his actions were fuelled by frustration			1
" @entity9 welcomes @entity55 's statement which was made honestly and after reflection			1
" we are all acutely aware of the responsibilities that lie with both the club and its players towards setting a good example as role models			0
" while it is clear that some of the events last night were regrettable , they occurred only because of the high emotions and frustrations which arose from the disappointment of a controversial defeat in such an important game			0
" we made representations to @entity79 immediately after the game and we await their comments following a review of the match report			0
