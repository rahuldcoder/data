-- as i waited in the cafe at @entity3 in @entity4 , the sound of laughter filtered through the front door			1
it was just past 8 a.m. on a friday , and the @entity10 team was already having a good time			1
" our team came together quickly , " @entity12 said later			1
" by the end of the morning it seemed as if we had all known each other for years			2
" every year @entity0 selects six @entity18 to race in a triathlon with dr. @entity20 and the @entity10 team			1
we give them a road bike ( with all the necessary accessories ) , a wet suit and a gym membership to help them prepare for the @entity28 on september 14			2
as they train for their first triathlon with support from our fitness and nutrition coaches , they blog , tweet and share their workouts online			1
@entity0 readers follow along as the team gets ready to swim a half - mile in the ocean , bike 18 miles and run 4 miles along the @entity41			1
6 people who will inspire you this year that friday morning was the start of the team 's second day at @entity46 , where they met each other , their coaches and the @entity50 for the first time			1
" after a couple of sessions with april , our coach , any fear and uncertainty that i had prior to arriving in @entity4 had gone away , " @entity12 said			1
" that weekend solidified in my mind ... the plan that is being laid out for me and my team will be more than sufficient to make us successful			1
" their confidence was evident as the @entity10 team ordered breakfast -- veggie egg white omelets or a protein smoothie -- and headed down the hall to a nutrition lecture			1
as they settled in , the friendly banter continued			0
for the past few years , the @entity10 team has been called the " 6 - pack			1
" this year they 're branding themselves a little differently			2
" we came up with the name ' @entity75 ' as our team name because we all have a little sassiness inside of us , " says @entity73			1
" that compelled us to believe in ourselves enough to submit that video -- even though we 'd all been beaten by our struggles with weight and health and other emotional issues ( before )			2
" @entity73 knows these struggles well			0
the @entity87 woman once weighed nearly 400 pounds			0
when she developed type 2 diabetes , she decided enough was enough and has since lost 100 pounds			0
each member of the team has a different story to tell			2
but they all have the same goal : to learn how to live a healthier lifestyle , and to inspire others to do the same			0
" a journey to wellness can be long and lonely when done individually , " @entity96 says			0
" i have started the journey to wellness before , but when i was confronted with stress i reverted back to my unhealthy habits			0
( now ) the power of the entire @entity105 team will be there to hold me accountable , encourage me , pick me up and put me on the right track again			2
" @entity108 will find strength in @entity110 , who is taking advantage of this opportunity to no longer be " the guy who wanted to do things but physically could n't			0
" @entity110 will be inspired by @entity116 , who wants to lose 50 pounds by the time september rolls around			0
and all will try to inspire friends and family at home			0
" what does @entity10 mean to me ? it means responsibility to my fellow ' @entity125 ' team members , friends , family and supporters all over the world , " @entity110 says			1
" my story is reaching a global audience , which is amazing to think about			0
i can not let the people who are supporting me down			0
" " i know now that i am not alone , " @entity132 adds			0
" that i am supported and encouraged			0
and i wish to be that for anyone out there who is reading this and has lost hope and is considering giving up			0
" during kick - off weekend , the team underwent several physical fitness tests , spoke with @entity20 about their goals , and climbed @entity141 just outside of @entity4			1
they left the city sunday ready to start their training			1
" we have a long hard road ahead of us , but the camaraderie we have is undeniable and confidence we have in our abilities as a team is growing , " @entity145 said			2
" together , we know we can do this			0

the @entity10 team has named themselves the " @entity75 "
the six @entity18 bonded quickly during @entity156 in @entity4
they 're ready to start training for their first triathlon -- follow along !
