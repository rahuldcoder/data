@entity0 -- @entity2 on wednesday became the first state to pass a law saying no thanks to part of president @entity8 's health care proposal			1
the @entity9 says in part , " every person within the state of @entity2 is and shall be free to choose or decline to choose any mode of securing health care services without penalty or threat of penalty			2
" gov. @entity19 , a @entity20 , said wednesday he signed it because he believes any health care laws should ensure people are " treated as an individual , rather than as an amorphous mass whose only purpose in this world is to obey federal mandates			2
" several other states may follow suit			0
the governor of @entity32 is expected to sign a bill passed in his state last week , and according to @entity36 , similar proposals have made it through one chamber of the legislatures in @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42			0
while such bills have recently failed in six states , 22 additional states have seen proposals introduced			1
these state laws would directly conflict with the national health care bill that @entity49 are trying to pass , which includes a requirement that all individuals get health coverage or face a tax penalty			1
several legal analysts said if @entity56 enacts a national health care law , it would supersede any state laws written to block them			1
" i think most of the states that are passing these laws understand that they ca n't trump federal law with state law , " said professor @entity59 at @entity60			1
" but what they get out of it is symbolic effect			0
they 're sending a message to the federal politicians that they do n't like the health care mandate			0
" such state laws might not be the only legal challenge to @entity49 health care legislation			1
@entity78 attorney general @entity77 , a @entity20 , on tuesday sent a letter to the other 49 state attorneys general , asking them to join him " in preparing a legal challenge to the constitutionality of whatever individual mandate provision emerges , immediately upon the legislation becoming law			1
" states have previously challenged federal laws and regulations in areas aside from health care			2
five states have passed a @entity92 , according to @entity93 , including @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity42 and @entity97			0
the law declares that any guns that are manufactured and kept in - state are not subject to federal gun laws passed by @entity56 under interstate commerce authority , because the guns never crossed state lines			2
a number of states have also passed laws trying to wrest more control from @entity0 over issues such as how public lands are used or how a state 's @entity112 forces are deployed overseas , according to the @entity114 , which advocates for states ' rights			2
while such laws may face an uphill path in court , supporters describe them as a sign of public opinion , which can still have impact			0
they point to last year 's announcement of federal policy on medicinal marijuana , after 14 states passed laws to allow its use			0
while federal drug law makes no exception to allow medicinal use of marijuana , attorney general @entity131 said in october that prosecuting the use of medicinal marijuana users would n't be a priority			1
he said the @entity144 would instead " effectively focus our resources on serious drug traffickers , while taking into account state and local laws			0
" @entity1 's @entity145 and @entity146 contributed to this report .			0
