-- a buzz ripples through the packed stadium as word quickly spreads : " he 's here			2
" the jostling crowd surges forward , camera phones held high to catch a glimpse of the superstar flanked by a dense entourage			0
but it 's not an a-list actor or musician throwing the fans into a frenzy			0
instead , a four - year - old horse called @entity16 is about to make history by winning his 14th -- and final -- consecutive race			1
a sold - out crowd of 32,500 people watched @entity23 at @entity24 in october -- the highest number for an autumn flat racing event in @entity27			1
it 's a testament to the popularity of the celebrity colt who , much like @entity31 , @entity32 or @entity33 , needs no last name			2
but it 's also an indication of just how far horse racing has come in 2012			1
changing perceptions it 's the second biggest spectator sport in @entity27 after football , with around 6 million people heading to the track every year			1
but the pomp and pageantry of racing -- think silly hats , freeflowing champagne and manicured gardens -- means that the general public has long viewed it as a fun day out , rather than a competitive sport			2
this year however , racing attracted a new audience who knew the names of horses , recognized industry heavyweights and understood the importance of big competitions			1
" probably the most amazing moment of the year was @entity16 winning the @entity61			1
you had 32,000 people all on their feet , cheering him on , it was just the most emotional moment , " @entity62 , chief executive of @entity63 , said of the horse 's last race			1
" it 's a bit of an eccentric world , horse racing			1
but once you understand the theater of it , once you know the big names , it becomes so much more enjoyable			2
" rise of the celebrity horse a lot of the hype was due to celebrity horses such as @entity16 and @entity85 's @entity84 , who remains unbeaten in 22 consecutive races and even appeared on the front cover of @entity89			1
these were champions of a caliber rarely seen in one generation , let alone competing at the peaks of their careers in the same year			2
in a new digital age , their fame was carefully cultivated			0
marketing teams set up @entity101 accounts , @entity103 profiles , and pedaled merchandise online			0
and it seemed to work			0
attendance at races starring @entity16 were up 20 % on last year			1
similarly , a small army of @entity84 fans -- draped in the horse 's native @entity85 flag or salmon pink silks -- cheered on the mare to victory at the @entity114 at @entity24 in june			1
however , the overall figure of 280,000 for all five days was down 14,000 from last year			2
meanwhile , a record 130,000 punters attended the prestigious @entity117 in july , which launched @entity119 's official jubilee celebrations , making it the largest sports crowd in @entity27 in 2012			1
more people were also watching horse racing on tv , with 11 million tuning in to @entity27 's biggest competition , @entity126 -- up 2 million on last year			1
@entity128 's shame however , it was n't a flawless year for racing			1
the sport 's poster boy , @entity133 jockey @entity128 , was given a six - month ban earlier this month after failing a drugs test in @entity136			2
the three - time champion , who earlier announced the end of his long tenure with the @entity141 stable , said it was not a performance - enhancing substance			0
" he 's admitted it was a moment of madness , " @entity62 said			0
" it 's a shame			0
he 's an important face in horse racing			1
" " when it comes to talking to the media , jockeys are a bit of a challenge			2
these guys are living and breathing the sport , putting in a huge number of hours			0
they can be difficult to pin down			0
" far better recognized were celebrity owners such as tv entertainers @entity158 , actress @entity160 and @entity27 's @entity119			1
@entity16 's trainer @entity161 , who is battling cancer , was also " hugely loved , " @entity62 added			1
ladies ' day one jockey not shying away from the camera this year was @entity167 @entity166			1
the 36 - year - old made history after becoming the first woman to compete in the world 's richest horse race , the $ 10 million @entity172 , in march			1
but the model perhaps garnered more attention off the track for her naked photoshoot on a horse in @entity179 in june			1
@entity180 , who did much to raise the profile of female jockeys in a traditionally male - dominated sport , retired in october			2
not just a pretty face , she had more than 900 wins in a career spanning 12 years			0
a weighty issue @entity180 said she was now looking forward to " cutting loose and having a cheeseburger or some pizza			0
" " those types of indulgences are not allowed when you constantly have to monitor your weight , " she added			0
jockeys are put under enormous pressure to meet miniature weight requirements , with sweat suits , saunas , hot baths and starvation are some of the methods used to keep trim			0
but some relief is in sight -- albeit slight -- after the @entity207 last month raised the minimum weight by two pounds to 8 stone ( 50 kg ) , from january next year			2
international highlights across the @entity215 , the winner of the @entity213 ' premier race , the @entity214 , was denied the chance of a @entity217 after being forced to retire ahead of the @entity218			0
i 'll have another developed a foreleg injury that trainer @entity222 described as " freakish			0
" the three - year - old had been seeking to be the first horse in 34 years to win the treble , having triumphed at the 138th @entity214 showpiece in may and then the @entity227			2
racing authorities also confirmed that the legendary @entity229 set a record time in winning the 1973 @entity227 event , ending a controversy that had lasted almost four decades			0
in @entity85 , the @entity232 was won by a home horse for the first time since 2009 as @entity235 headed off a strong field of " international invaders			0
" @entity136 's @entity238 was won by four - year - old filly @entity239 , who denied @entity242 's @entity241 in his bid to become the first @entity245 trained victor			0
@entity246 was unable to defend her title due to an outbreak of equine infectious anaemia at the racing yard in the @entity252 city of @entity253 where she is trained			0
@entity256 's ruler @entity255 celebrated as @entity257 rode @entity258 to victory in the the emirate 's @entity172 in april , but the result was somewhat overshadowed by the death of another @entity141 horse , @entity264 , in the inaugural @entity265 held earlier in the meeting			0
weathering the storm the biggest challenge for the @entity27 racing industry this year ? the great @entity27 weather -- which forced the cancellation of 119 races up to the start of december			1
" after the @entity275 weekend it did n't stop raining until the end of july , " @entity62 said			0
" there was a good six weeks when we lost meetings			0
" whatever the weather , the outlook looks bright for horse racing in 2013 .			1

2012 is a big year in horse racing as 6 million people head to the track
rise of celebrity horses @entity16 and @entity84 helps create buzz
