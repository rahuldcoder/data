-- @entity1 returned to his native @entity2 on friday where he created a stir with a comment about birth certificates , reopening a thorny issue pushed by some republicans who question whether president @entity9 is a @entity10 - born citizen , a requisite for the @entity12			1
separately , embattled @entity14 congressman @entity13 formally announced that he would remain in the @entity16 senate race despite widespread calls from his party to step down after his controversial remarks about rape and pregnancy			1
and a new national poll showed @entity1 and @entity9 remain deadlocked just days before the opening of the @entity24 in @entity25			1
appearing in @entity26 , @entity2 , with his running mate , rep. @entity27 , @entity1 sought to preview the personal narrative that will be a major focus of next week 's nominating convention			1
he began his stump speech reminding voters of his roots in the @entity34 suburbs			0
" i love being home in this place where @entity37 and i were raised , where both of us were born , " @entity1 said			2
" @entity37 was born at @entity40 , i was born at @entity41			0
no one has ever asked to see my birth certificate			1
they know that this is the place that we were born and raised , " he said			0
although @entity1 was talking about his own birth certificate , the comment amounted to an indirect zing at @entity9 and the so - called " birther " controversy that has followed him since the last presidential campaign			1
the thousands who turned out to see @entity1 roared at the punch line			2
the @entity12 released @entity9 's full birth certificate in 2011 , showing he was born in a @entity56 hospital on august 4 , 1961			1
only " natural born " citizens of the @entity10 are eligible to be president in a statement responding to @entity1 's comments , @entity9 campaign spokesman @entity59 mentioned real estate magnate @entity62 and others who have pursued the issue			1
" throughout this campaign , governor @entity1 has embraced the most strident voices in his party instead of standing up to them , " @entity59 said , adding that @entity1 's " decision to directly enlist himself in the ' birther ' movement should give pause to any rational voter across @entity10			2
" the @entity9 campaign used the comment in a campaign appeal to supporters , encouraging them to think about " what he 's actually saying , and what it says about @entity1			1
then make a donation of $ 5 or more to re-elect @entity9 today			2
" a @entity1 aide said after @entity1 's remarks that the former @entity84 governor has " repeatedly said " that he believes @entity9 was born in the @entity10			1
" he was only referencing that @entity2 , where he is campaigning today , is the state where he himself was born and raised , " the aide said			2
the comment resonated with some supporters gathered for the campaign event			0
" there 's been a lot of talk about it one way or another , " said @entity90 of @entity91 , @entity2			2
" the truth is @entity9 probably has n't released all the documents he could			0
" i thought it was great because why should we have to worry about whether the president has a birth certificate or not , " said @entity100 of @entity101 , @entity2			1
@entity2 is a battleground in november			0
@entity9 won the state four years ago and authorized the massive taxpayer - sponsored rescue of failing @entity34 automakers and suppliers in 2009			0
@entity1 's father was a former auto industry executive and governor of the state			0
he also sought the @entity14 presidential nomination in 1968			0
new presidential poll shows virtual tie , @entity13 remains in race separately , a @entity0 / @entity119 poll showed @entity1 and @entity9 in a dead heat as the campaign approached its fall stretch drive , placing heavier importance on the @entity14 gathering that starts monday and the @entity126 convention the week after in @entity127			1
according to the survey , 49 % of likely voters said they were backing @entity9 and 47 % supported @entity1			1
the margin is within the survey 's sampling error , meaning the race is a statistical tie			1
further , 48 % of likely voters who are independents said they supported @entity1 , with 45 % backing @entity9			1
in the race for @entity136 in @entity16 , @entity13 told a news conference that he would not abandon his campaign despite widespread calls from fellow @entity14 to do so since unleashing a political firestorm in a @entity142 television interviewed aired on sunday			1
a six - term member of @entity144 with deep ties to @entity147 conservatives , @entity13 initially apologized and said he would not drop out			0
he made it official on friday			0
" we are going to be here through the november election , and we are going to be here to win , " he said			0
" i may not be the favorite candidate of some people within the @entity14 establishment , but the voters made a decision and this is an election , it 's not a selection , " @entity13 said			1
@entity14 have been counting on @entity13 , who won a three - way primary fight , to defeat incumbent democrat @entity160 in the campaign considered crucial for any @entity14 hopes of capturing control of the @entity136			1
@entity1 came out more forcefully in an interview , calling the remarks " deeply offensive			0
" " i ca n't defend what he said ; i ca n't defend him , " @entity1 said			0
more waves before convention , @entity172 delegates with convention planning in the home stretch , @entity1 's campaign is considering a dramatic scheduling change to guarantee @entity177 a much larger national audience - but the shift could also cause tensions with a rising @entity14 star and @entity182 , @entity0 has learned			2
if @entity177 is moved from monday to thursday night , she would introduce her husband and bump sen. @entity185 , @entity186 from that role			1
@entity14 sources confirm such a move is under consideration but stress that no final decision has been made			0
a @entity1 campaign spokeswoman declined to discuss any hypothetical scheduling moves			0
@entity177 is considered by many to be one of her husband 's strongest surrogates by helping to soften up his image as a calculated businessman			0
convention organizers and attendees also watched to see if a storm churning through the @entity203 with ferocious winds and heavy rains would head for western @entity206 just as 50,000 people open the convention			2
planners were confident that @entity210 would not disrupt the four - day event and that @entity1 would be nominated as scheduled			0
@entity1 got some good news on friday ahead of the convention			2
@entity172 , who at one point was @entity1 's top challenger for the nomination , officially released his delegates and encouraged them to back the presumptive nominee			0
