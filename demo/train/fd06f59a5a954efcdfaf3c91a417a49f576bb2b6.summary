-- the problem of planes hitting birds comes down to a key fact : " we 're competing for airspace , " says @entity7 , a biologist who spent 20 years studying the problem at the @entity10 @entity9			1
@entity7 says " bird strikes that would disable both engines on an aircraft is fortunately a rare event			1
" populations of large birds have increased dramatically since the 1970s , when environmental regulations were instituted in the @entity10			1
birds have become more accustomed to living in urban environments near airports and the number of airline flights has risen sharply , according to @entity7			1
@entity7 , who retired in september 2008 and is now a consultant on the issue , spoke with @entity0 hours after a @entity25 plane crash - landed in the @entity27 in @entity28 after an apparent bird strike			1
he retired as @entity30 for the @entity31 and was chairperson of @entity33 from 1997 - 2008			0
@entity0 : how big a problem are bird strikes ? @entity7 : every year , approximately 7,000 to 8,000 bird strikes are reported to the @entity37 primarily by commercial airlines nationwide			1
the reporting is a voluntary system			0
it 's not mandatory , so we know that not all of the bird strikes are being reported			1
we estimate that as much as 80 percent of the strikes are not reported			1
it 's a fairly common occurrence to have bird strikes , but to have bird strikes that would disable both engines on an aircraft is fortunately a rare event			1
@entity0 : what are some of the most serious instances of bird strikes ? @entity7 : in 1995 , at @entity55 in @entity56 , a @entity57 , a wide - bodied jet adapted to military use as a surveillance plane , ingested @entity62 geese into two of four engines			1
it crashed a mile away and killed 24 airmen			0
in @entity68 , @entity69 , in november , a @entity66 , which is very similar to the @entity67 320 , flew through a flock of starlings and both engines were disabled			0
the pilot was able to land the plane on the runway , but it collapsed the landing gear and did extensive damage to the aircraft			0
there were a few injuries , but no one was killed			0
last march in @entity84 , a business jet was taking off and it struck a flock of white pelicans , which is another species which is increasing			1
it crashed into a wood lot and killed all five businesspeople aboard			0
the root of the problem right now is that because of the very successful wildlife conservation programs in @entity95 since the 1970s , we 've seen a tremendous resurgence of many wildlife species , particularly large bird species -- species that weigh over 4 pounds , including @entity62 geese , snow geese , bald eagles , great blue herons , double - crested cormorants , turkey vultures and black vultures			1
in fact , of the 36 species of birds in @entity95 that weigh over 4 pounds , 24 of those have shown population increases , nine have shown stable populations and only one has shown a decline in the last 30 years			1
the @entity62 goose population in the @entity10 -- the resident @entity62 geese , not the migrant birds from @entity62 -- has increased from 1 million birds in 1990 to about 3.9 million in 2008			1
in addition to these populations increasing , they 've also adapted to urban environments			2
they 're not afraid to associate with people			0
traffic does n't bother them , aircraft do n't bother them			0
so they 're more likely to be seen near airports			2
another important factor is modern turbofan aircraft like the @entity67 320			0
their engines are much quieter than older aircraft			0
and almost all the noise comes out of the back of the engine			0
birds are less able to hear or see modern aircraft			2
there are more airplanes in the sky , more birds in the sky and this is where the conflict comes in			2
the number of strikes being reported is definitely increasing			1
in 1990 , the @entity37 had approximately 1,750 strikes reported			2
and in 2007 , the last year we have data , we had 7,600			0
some of that may be due to a little better reporting , but there are also more aircraft flying today			0
@entity0 : what can be done to prevent these strikes ? @entity7 : there are three basic things that airports can do and many airports are doing			1
one is habitat management at the airport to make it as sterile as possible for birds -- by eliminating standing water , keeping grass where you do n't have weeds producing seeds which attract birds , reducing perching areas for the birds , posts and things birds can perch on , covering up garbage , not allowing landfills close to an airport , making an airport as sanitary as possible			2
that would also include rodent control -- eliminating small mammals that owls and hawks might be attracted to -- and insect controls			0
habitat management is the no. 1 defense			0
the second is dispersal of birds by a trained bird control crew that goes out and uses pyrotechnics and other means to scare the birds away when they do come onto the airport			1
some airports use trained dogs			2
a few airports train falcons			2
the idea is to scare the birds , harass the birds			2
the third area is removal of birds when the habitat management and dispersal do not work			2
sometimes @entity62 geese become accustomed to the harassment and they 're not scared by it anymore			2
airports get permits to remove some @entity62 geese by using a shotgun to demonstrate to the other birds that this is not a place to be			1
these are very selective lethal controls			0
now , with regard to aircraft , there is research under way looking at can you enhance the visibility of aircraft to birds , using uv reflective paint since birds can see in the uv - range and using flashing lights			2
are there things which can be mounted on aircraft to make them more visible to birds ? this is just in an experimental stage			0
one final area of research is the use of bird - detecting radar to help air traffic control and pilots to detect the birds and help drive planes around concentrations of birds			1
this is not operational , it 's in a developmental stage			0
none of these things are going to be silver bullets			0
no one technique or procedure is going to solve the problem			0
@entity0 : are enough resources being applied to solve this problem ? @entity7 : it 's an area that needs more attention			1
airports have bird control programs to varying degrees			1
it has not been a high - profile area of work			0
we need to devote more resources to this problem , particularly given the increasing number of birds we have			1
we 're competing for airspace			0
it 's a complex issue			0
this incident will perhaps really focus peoples ' attention to do a better job of solving the problem .			1

@entity7 : planes are contending with an increasing number of birds
environmental rules have led to large jump in numbers of big birds like geese
@entity7 says airports are taking steps to reduce risk of bird strikes
he says more attention should be paid to solving the problem
