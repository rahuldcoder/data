the extraordinary revelation this week that the @entity1 targeted tea party groups for more aggressive enforcement highlights exactly why caution is needed in any response to the much - vilified @entity7 decision in @entity8 v. @entity9			1
it also shows how all @entity12 , from the most liberal to the most conservative , should closely guard their first amendment rights , and why giving the government too much power to limit political speech will inevitably result in selective enforcement against unpopular groups			1
to the agency 's credit , @entity19 , a senior official at the @entity1 , apologized on friday for these unconstitutional practices , which are as unseemly as the @entity25 administration 's targeting of the @entity26 and the @entity28 ' defunding of @entity29 on purely political grounds			1
@entity19 said that career @entity1 staff who were reviewing applicants for tax - exempt status took a harder look at applications with " tea party " or " patriot " in their names			1
she stressed that the added scrutiny was done as a " shortcut , " not out of " political bias			0
" but her admission calls into question earlier claims by the agency that @entity1 scrutiny was n't politically motivated , and it comes in the face of repeated complaints by right - wing groups that they have been treated unfairly			1
@entity50 says @entity1 revelations will fuel distrust in government before addressing the obvious constitutional concerns with the selective use of the tax code against political opponents , here 's some background			1
certain public interest groups , like charities and nonprofit athletic organizations , do not have to pay federal income tax on their donations or dues			2
these tax - exempt groups include 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organizations ( named for the relevant section of the code )			2
to qualify , a group must be " operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare			0
" the definition of " social welfare " is broad , and applies to all points of view			0
the @entity79 's lobbying arm , for which we work , is a 501 ( c ) ( 4 )			0
these social welfare groups are forbidden from engaging in too much partisan political activity			2
how much is too much , however , is controversial and remains uncertain			0
an organization that crosses over the fuzzy line will be denied tax - exempt status			2
crucially , 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organizations , in most cases , need not publicly disclose their donors			0
that policy is driven by the same concerns that prompted the @entity7 in a civil rights - era case , @entity26 v. @entity95 , to prohibit that state from forcing the @entity26 to out its members as a condition of operating			0
the court reasoned , rightly , that such disclosure could lead to violence against existing members and would dissuade potential members from joining at all			0
now , during the past couple of elections there has been a surge in applications for 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) tax - exempt status			0
some argue that these new groups are being created specifically to help elect or defeat candidates , which would otherwise prompt full donor disclosure to the @entity9			0
opponents claim these groups are abusively claiming tax - exempt status to keep their donor lists secret			2
some further claim that these groups then allow wealthy individuals , corporations , and unions to anonymously funnel large amounts of money into ads supporting or attacking political candidates			0
as a consequence , the @entity1 has been under enormous pressure to speed up and aggressively investigate applications for tax - exempt status -- both reasonable demands , if carried out impartially			1
but much of this outside pressure has come from the left and has been directed at conservative groups , who have an advantage in this " dark " political money			1
it sounds as though the events surrounding the @entity1 announcement can be partly attributed to this growth in applications and the pressure to uncover " sham " 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) groups			1
although the @entity1 claims this was an honest mistake , these revelations are troubling on many levels			2
for instance , there are several proposals circulating in @entity151 right now that would make it much easier for the @entity1 and other regulators to force political groups to disclose their donors			1
these disclosure requirements would apply even when the group is advocating purely on an issue of public interest , from clean air to abortion , and would apply to groups of all political persuasions and not just to groups supporting or opposing candidates for office			0
the @entity79 has expressed concern with these disclosure requirements precisely because they open the door to selective enforcement			0
such concerns are often dismissed as speculative and overly pessimistic , but the @entity1 apology shows that concerns over selective enforcement are prescient			1
those in power will always be tempted to use political speech restrictions against opposing candidates or causes			0
the @entity1 announcement demonstrates that we should carefully consider any new policy that allows the government to restrict or chill political speech , including broader donor disclosure requirements			2
@entity184 and the administration should also act immediately to create ironclad checks on the @entity1 to prevent this from ever happening again			1
it should n't need to be said : even the tea party deserves @entity191 protection .			1
