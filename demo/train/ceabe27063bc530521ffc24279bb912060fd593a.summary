-- @entity2 counterterrorism officials are closely watching an @entity4 fighter in @entity5 who could become the next @entity2 to be targeted for killing by a drone strike , @entity0 has learned			1
the person has been the subject of debate among military commanders and intelligence officials for several weeks as they decide what to recommend			0
president @entity14 would make a final decision			2
@entity0 has also learned key members of @entity17 have been aware of the internal debate			0
the officials spoke to @entity0 's @entity20 on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation			0
the current discussions involve both military commanders in the special forces community and intelligence officials			0
a key point being discussed is whether it is better to maintain surveillance to see what added intelligence can be gained about any threats to the @entity2 , and whether additional monitoring might lead to other operatives or @entity4 elements to target			1
under the @entity14 administration 's policy for targeting @entity2 , a person would have to pose an imminent threat to the @entity2 and there would be no reasonable prospect of capture			1
a @entity2 official said drone targeting inside @entity5 is very sensitive because of the fragile state of the @entity5 government , which is under pressure to ban such strikes			1
as a potential strike is weighed , some officials contend that good relations with the @entity55 government is a priority so the @entity2 can maintain some type of long - term surveillance operation of potential @entity4 targets there			1
if all @entity2 troops leave neighboring @entity63 at the end of 2014 , the concern is it may be harder to maintain high priority efforts such as conducting further drone operations over @entity5 and to also monitor @entity5 's nuclear programs			1
as the @entity2 considers a strike in @entity5 , there are also recent indications that @entity4 in @entity5 and its affiliate in @entity73 , @entity74 , have stepped up their links , a second official told @entity0			1
@entity76 , an @entity2 citizen , is currently with @entity74			2
he is the highest - ranking @entity2 in the group , believed to be in a remote part of southern @entity73			2
the @entity79 currently has a $ 5 million reward on his head			0
@entity0 terrorism analyst @entity82 said there are indications @entity76 has contacts with senior @entity4 leadership in @entity5			1
the @entity2 failed to kill @entity74 leader @entity87 in a drone strike in southern @entity73 just a few weeks ago			1
and last october , @entity89 failed to capture a third key leader , a man named @entity91			0
they assaulted a compound he was said to be at in southern @entity73 but withdrew under heavy fire			0
although @entity96 and @entity87 were said to be involved in the deadly attack last year on a shopping mall in @entity99 , @entity2 officials have told @entity0 that one reason @entity96 was targeted was there was critical intelligence he had been communicating with operatives of @entity105			1
that @entity107 based @entity4 group is considered the most dangerous of its affiliates to @entity2 security			1
former official says @entity2 justified the @entity14 administration would be justified using drones to kill @entity2 terrorists abroad and at home , former @entity2 attorney general @entity111 told @entity0 on tuesday			1
" they 've been very , very effective in the war on terror , " the former @entity117 appointee told @entity0 's " @entity121			0
" " it 's a wonderful technology			0
" two key decisions would be involved -- whether to put an @entity2 on a kill list and whether to execute on the kill order , said @entity111 , who is now in private practice with a law firm in @entity128			1
" as to the second , i think the president has the authority -- as the commander in chief -- once you identify where an ' enemy combatant ' is , to take action , to take him out on the battlefield like you would any other enemy , " he said			0
due process would be a concern only in designating someone as an " enemy combatant , " he said			0
once that decision has been made , " then the commander in chief should be able to execute on that order at the moment of his choosing , because you never know when you might locate that individual -- you might only have minutes , you might only have hours			0
" but the administration has reportedly taken months to decide whether to target someone , a pace that might wind up working against it , @entity111 said			1
" i think the courts are going to ask , if they finally take up this issue , you have months to make this determination , why is n't there more due process given to the individual , to the @entity2 citizen ? " @entity2 targeted before the @entity2 has targeted an @entity2 before , most notably @entity107 - @entity2 cleric @entity160 , a key member of @entity105 killed by a drone in 2011			1
another @entity2 , @entity162 , was killed in the same strike , though he was not the target of the operation			1
@entity162 was behind @entity4 's english - language @entity166 , which aimed to influence jihadis and wannabe jihadis around the world			2
" what i would worry about is that the courts have seemed to indicate that , when you 're talking about the rights of @entity2 citizens , there are certain due process considerations that have to be taken into account before you designate someone as an enemy combatant , " @entity111 said			1
" i would have advised the president that @entity183 is an enemy combatant and , mr. president , you do have the authority to take him out in a drone strike			2
but i would also caution that , given recent @entity187 decisions , i 'm not sure there are five votes on the court that would agree with that assessment			0
" @entity111 , who supported the @entity117 administration 's policies that many derided as torture , said @entity17 ' continued funding of anti-terrorism efforts " indicates tacit agreement that the war on terror can continue , and that these kinds of actions are in fact lawful			2
" he noted that @entity17 gets periodic briefings on such matters and " apparently has no issues , no major problems with these kinds of tactics			0
" asked whether drones might be used to kill @entity2 who have been determined to be pressing , imminent threats to @entity2 safety on @entity2 soil , @entity111 said doing so was probable , even though it might worry civil libertarians			1
" it 's very likely that we 're going to confront more terrorists here in this country ; it 's very likely they are going to be @entity2 citizens			2
and if , in fact , this is an effective technology , why would n't you use this technology to eliminate this threat ? " @entity228 says government abusing power the @entity228 contends the administration abuses its power , particularly when it comes to drone strikes			2
" even in the context of an armed conflict against an armed group , the government may use lethal force only against individuals who are directly participating in hostilities against the @entity2 , " the group says on its website			2
" regardless of the context , whenever the government uses lethal force , it must take all possible steps to avoid harming civilian bystanders			0
but these are not the standards that the executive branch is using			0
" unofficial estimates based on reports by human rights groups and media accounts indicate the @entity14 administration has carried out hundreds of drone strikes that have killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of people , including civilians , in an escalation of the practice the @entity117 administration started			1
most have occurred in @entity63 , but others have taken place in countries with no ground war , including @entity107 , where @entity160 was killed			0
critics say the government oversteps the legal boundaries of the @entity271 and international law , particularly by making decisions on targeted killings in secret without going before any court			1
@entity277 , who directs the @entity228 's @entity278 , told @entity0 that the @entity14 administration was " fighting hard " to prevent a judicial review of the strikes that killed @entity160 and the other @entity2 , including the terrorist 's 16 - year - old son			1
until allegations in classified documents can be assessed in court , she said , the question of whether they amount to real evidence remains unanswered			0
@entity289 called the @entity2 actions " one of the most extreme and dangerous forms of authority that the executive branch can claim -- the power to kill people based on vague and shifting legal standards , secret evidence and no judicial review even after the fact			2
" critics : @entity14 's anti-terrorism strategy confusing @entity14 has insisted his responsibility as commander in chief to protect @entity2 from attack justified targeted killings such as the drone strike on @entity160			1
in a may speech , he rejected targeting an @entity2 citizen without what he called due process , meaning adherence to full legal procedures			0
critics , including congressional @entity315 , argue the president 's anti-terrorism strategy , which in many ways extended programs and practices started under the @entity117 administration , have failed to curtail @entity4			2
asked last week at a congressional hearing if @entity4 was stronger or weaker than before the 9/11 attacks , director of national intelligence @entity324 conceded the terrorist network was more widespread			0
at the same hearing , @entity328 chairman @entity327 argued that tighter restrictions on targeted killings announced last year had weakened the government 's fight against terrorism			0
@entity0 's @entity20 contributed to this report .			0
