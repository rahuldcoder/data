-- before the curtain rose for " @entity3 " at @entity5 's @entity4 last night , an announcer listed the house rules and then added , " by the way , the role of @entity3 will be played by @entity9			1
" the subsequent shrieking was likely the loudest ever for a @entity12 stand - in			2
@entity14 's buildup to the ' breakdown ' : a look back at the punk trio 's career it was an impressive @entity12 debut for the @entity14 frontman , whose character is an evil influence on the punky protagonist @entity22 ( played by @entity23 ) it was also a rare opportunity to see @entity9 in the role : he is filling in for @entity12 vet @entity28 ( who is on short leave for a family matter ) for eight performances , the last one of which happens sunday night			1
his lines were few , but the 38 - year - old fell naturally into the flow of the choreography , and of course , he gave inimitable , passionate performances of his own songs ( " homecoming , " " she 's a rebel , " " @entity41 , " and " @entity42			1
" ) ' @entity3 ' musical : meet the show 's rocker cast @entity9 appeared 30 minutes into the show , atop a moving staircase , where he howled the " 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 " count - off during " @entity3			1
" the applause was deafening as he sang the first lines : he strutted down the stairs , grabbed his crotch during the thrashing breakdown , and joined the rest of the cast in their choreographed moves , shooting them up with heroin			2
as the track 's final note was struck , he grasped hands with @entity23 , and remained in the position for a full minute , to huge applause			2
video : @entity14 on ' @entity3 ' " it turns out he 's a really good actor , " @entity66 , a fan in his early twenties , told @entity0 after the show			1
there was choreography , and i believed his character			1
" since the musical ( which is based on the 2004 @entity14 album of the same name , which itself sold five million copies and won a @entity78 for @entity79 ) debuted in april , @entity9 has promoted it tirelessly , once surprising the audience with a short @entity14 set , performing with the cast on @entity84 and appearing on local @entity86 television			1
" these people were on a stage singing my songs -- it was kind of like being invited to your own funeral , " @entity9 told " @entity0 " after witnessing the play last spring			0
" it blew me away			0
" @entity95 reviews ' @entity3 ' playing @entity3 amounts to @entity9 's biggest show of support yet for the show , which last week played to half - full houses			1
( last night appeared to be sold out			0
) he was respectful of the role , and seemingly intent on not overshadowing the cast -- he never broke character or sang numbers outside of his role			2
still , he brought 20 years of stage experience to the role			0
he stood on a television during " @entity42 , " making his trademark bug eyes and pantomiming a gun to his head , and ripped off his shirt during " the death of @entity3 " ( revealing plenty of chest tattoos ) as the cast crowded around him until he fell backward into their arms			1
after the full - cast bow ( @entity9 did n't take his own ) , the curtain reopened while the full cast held acoustic guitars			0
@entity9 picked the opening notes to for " @entity126 ) , " taking the full first verse -- typically , the cast trades lines -- then left rest of them to the actors			0
afterwards , the audience spilled onto @entity133 and a massive mob waited for @entity9 to emerge ( he eventually did , but went straight to his car			0
) " it was surreal to see [ @entity9 ] singing what he wrote up close and personal , " 19 - year - old @entity138 said outside			0
" from the first moment he was there , i was in awe			0
