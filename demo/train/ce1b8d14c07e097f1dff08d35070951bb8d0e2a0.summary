-- in decades past , your grandfather may have taken granny to the park , got down on one knee and proposed to her , with a sparkling ring in hand			2
nowadays , some suitors are reaching out to their brides - to - be through their computer , pushing a button and proposing : right through the internet			1
as technology continues to touch on almost every aspect of social life , there is no stopping this generation 's use of the internet as a tool -- even for marriage			2
but with these nontraditional methods of courtship , can we help but wonder : is chivalry dead ? @entity27 was surfing the net recently when he was inspired to propose marriage			1
the engagement ring for his long - time girlfriend had been hidden in his home for four months , and it was while chatting with other filmmakers that he figured out how he would propose to his wife			1
" i saw @entity39 tweet about the @entity41 's personalized video responses and that 's when the idea popped in my head to ask him to propose to my wife , " said @entity27 , a producer and director in @entity38			1
he tweeted to @entity47 , the shirtless shower man who plays the @entity41 , " can u ask my girlfriend to marry me ? her name is @entity51			0
" three hours later the deal was done			0
the @entity41 , wrapped in his towel , appears in a bathroom , dims the lights , rolls in candles , holds out a ring and reads the proposal in a deep , chivalrous voice			0
the video proposal went viral and @entity27 is now on his way to becoming a married man			0
@entity65 ' proposal is one example of the power the internet can have in personal lives , and raised the question about how technology impacts the tradition of the marriage proposal			0
@entity74 , owner of @entity75 , said that as time passes , proposals are becoming more elaborate and that technology encourages more opportunities for lovers to express their creativity			1
however , she finds the idea of proposing online as a substitute for the traditional act of getting down on one knee a bit puzzling			1
" any proposal where the girl says yes is a great proposal , " @entity74 said			0
" but would i recommend proposing on @entity89 or online to my clients ? never			1
" the current world of technology pressures people to do things bigger and better than they were done in the past , she said			2
yet she believes that by using social media or the internet as a sole medium to propose devalues the wedding proposal and denies the man the true creative buzz that comes from planning a wedding proposal			2
" proposing online may work for some people , but i think there are just so many other creative ways that you can pop the question and still embrace the tradition of getting down on one knee , " @entity74 said			1
it is men 's fear of rejection that pushes them to want to go public with their proposals online , said @entity113 , an associate professor of sociology at @entity115			1
just like proposing on a jumbotron at a baseball game , proposing in public gives men control by creating a situation that pressures women into saying yes			1
watch her propose during commencement speech " proposing online or in any public space has something to do with power in the relationship , " @entity113 said			1
" there might be fear if you ask them one - on - one because the woman might say no. proposing in public helps to reduce that risk			2
" what also makes proposing online more attractive is the economic benefit and feasibility			1
" the internet is a lot more accessible -- it 's more difficult to get a billboard at a baseball game or to hire a jumbo jet , " said @entity139 , whose fiancé proposed to her on @entity89 in january 2009			1
" grand gestures can be made online at little to no cost , and depending on the people that are involved , the proposal becomes more meaningful , " @entity146 said			2
the reporter for @entity153 and her computer programmer fiancé are self - proclaimed computer nerds whose obsessions with all things tech made their online proposal feel appropriate			2
yet it is this dramatic sense of efficiency , @entity113 said , that supports technology 's " obsessive and overtrumping culture			0
" the meaning behind the tradition of the wedding proposal and the chivalrous man coming to court his lady 's hand gets lost in a whirlwind of information that appears to be attempts at just being noticed			0
" with the internet , people tend to be less concerned with privacy , " @entity113 said			0
" they want to be obsessively public about something that people may think of as a private matter			0
" " fame and notoriety is something that people always have sought			0
in the internet age , the border to fame and notoriety is much lower , and because we live in an age of very gratifying self promotion , online proposals can sometimes devalue tradition			1
" watch man propose on live tv but for those who fame has hit for venturing online with a wedding proposal -- such as @entity197 and @entity198 , who became the first couple to propose on @entity89 -- chivalry is still alive			1
" i did n't feel any different than women whose boyfriend proposes on the jumbotron or billboard in @entity205 feel , " said @entity200			2
" is it the method that matters or the thought and outcome ? " @entity113 said he agrees with the latter			0
" i think that people can still have a very old fashioned view of relationships and the pursuit of marriage			0
the way people meet and are doing things are rapidly changing , and the internet is increasingly becoming the intermediary for all that			0
" so chivalry is n't dead			0
i think it is every bit of alive as it has ever been			0

some couples use sites such as @entity89 or @entity227 to propose
sociologist says that proposing online pressures women into saying " yes "
online proposals might be appropriate for a couple , some say
