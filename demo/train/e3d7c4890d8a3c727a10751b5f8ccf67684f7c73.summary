-- when you 're in a relationship -- and have been for quite some time -- you and your love bird are bound to have gone on all the usual dates many , many times over			2
so for @entity7 this year , do n't visit the restaurant the two of you eat at on a regular night and order the usual			1
we gathered romantic spots from around the country , along with some ideas that 'll work wherever you live , to help you plan a memorable day ( and night ) together			1
because even though there 's a lot of emphasis on buying presents that are pink , red , and covered in hearts and roses , @entity7 is about showing how much you appreciate your honey			1
spend the day enjoying each other 's company and think of the rest as trimmings			0
@entity29 , @entity30 for great food , delicious wine , and a hip , sexy atmosphere , visit @entity35			0
but do n't eat too much ! you 'll want to save room for dessert at @entity39 next door			1
pop over some for decadent , gourmet goodies before heading back to your love nest			0
@entity35 , 3939 @entity46 , 602 - 852 - 3939 @entity39 , 4410 n 40th st. , 602 - 840 - 7777 @entity47 , @entity48 there are plenty of romantic restaurants in @entity47			1
in fact , almost everything in @entity47 is swoon - worthy , save for @entity54 at 3 a.m. @entity55 is singular for both its ambiance and location			1
the piano bar is dimly lit , so it 's obviously got that going for it , and it also features delicious food and an intimate courtyard festooned by plants , a fountain , and fairy lights			0
but perhaps its most attractive quality is that it 's hidden in the @entity67 , which is a lovely , picturesque neighborhood around the @entity69 area that 's close enough to walk to from the @entity70 , but far enough away to weed out the tourists			0
@entity55 , 2600 chartres st. , 504 - 945 - 2222 @entity72 , @entity73 the @entity74 of @entity75 is an under - appreciated romantic gem located in @entity77			1
built in 1879 , it 's the oldest building in @entity77 , and the grounds around it are perfect for taking a daytime stroll while holding hands , of course			0
@entity74 of @entity75 , @entity77 , 100 @entity84 , 415 - 831 - 2090 the @entity0 : goodwill wants your relationship baggage @entity88 , @entity89 the @entity90 , a jazz bar on the north side where @entity94 's henchman hung out in the ' 20s , is full of history and has sexy lighting , great music , and does n't really get going until well after dark			1
@entity90 , 4802 n @entity100 , 773 - 878 - 5552 @entity101 , @entity102 if you 're the type who believes food is the ultimate aphrodisiac , @entity103 is the place to get you in the mood			1
@entity102 and weekenders from all over the eastern seaboard travel to come sample their how - do - they - do - it grilled pizza , which rivals any of the best pies in @entity114			1
because the wait is usually long , here 's a trick : put your name on the wait list and travel across the street for a drink at the @entity122 , which overlooks the water			1
@entity103 , 577 s main st. , 401 - 273 - 9760 @entity122 , 575 s water st. , 401 - 861 - 9007 @entity125 , @entity126 in a city that built its reputation on quickie divorces and casinos , it 's best to avoid tourist destinations and romantic casino packages for a memorable date			1
@entity125 has an attraction that 's getting harder to find across the country : a drive - in movie theater			1
the @entity138 , which opened in 1971 , is one of two drive - ins in the state			1
while you can pick up a tub of popcorn or a hamburger at the concession stand , part of the fun is packing food that you would n't be allowed to enjoy if you went to the local multiplex			0

you 'll hear jazz , rock and country tunes filling the night air			2
a favorite spot for lovers around the corner from @entity169 is the @entity180 , which features interesting new artists and taste bud - tingling @entity183 food			2
the @entity180 , 57 n. claiborne st. , 251 - 694 - 6853 @entity114 while the cocktails at the @entity187 are n't cheap ( around $ 10 - $ 20 ) , it 's a small price to pay to sit in one of the most gorgeous hotel lobbies in @entity190			2
@entity194 @entity193 rugs , @entity191 touches , and rich mahogany and leather furnishings lend the place a unique kind of hunter 's - lodge - in - @entity201 feel , and there 's nothing dreamier than sipping hot spiced wine beside the cozy fireplace			2
the @entity187 , 335 @entity206 , 212 - 505 - 9100 the @entity0 : when is the ideal time to get married ? @entity208 , @entity209 the most obvious way to express love is physically , with hugs , kisses , and other good stuff , but on the @entity218 's special @entity7 tour at 4 p.m. , you and your honey will see how love has been depicted with a paintbrush			1
