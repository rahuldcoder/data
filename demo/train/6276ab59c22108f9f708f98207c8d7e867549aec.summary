-- a @entity2 man who put up a website asking people to help him and his wife decide whether to have an abortion admitted tuesday they never intended to terminate the pregnancy			1
@entity9 , who describes himself as a conservative / libertarian and has stirred controversy for his conservative posts on several websites , said he wanted to stimulate conversation about the politically charged subject			1
@entity9 told @entity0 he bought the domain name " birthornot.com " before wife @entity17 became pregnant about four months ago			2
he said he had been mulling the idea " for some time , " adding that his wife is pro-choice but agreed that abortion was not on the table for them			0
" we chose our words very carefully , " @entity9 told @entity0 , insisting the site was not a hoax even though there were never any plans to accept the vote results if abortion won			1
" a lot of people elect representatives based on this issue alone , yet nothing happens , nothing comes of it , nothing changes			0
" he said , adding that the couple called the baby " @entity41 " to give people more to think about			2
" my intent is not to deceive people , but at the same point , i do want people to talk about this			2
this seemed like a pretty good way to further the discussion , because people do n't ever seem to want to talk about it for real if there 's no name on it , no @entity55 , " he said			1
media reports have identified @entity9 as a regular commenter -- frequently anti-abortion -- on such websites as @entity59 and the @entity60 , typically using the name " @entity62 , " which is also the name on his vanity license plate			1
he also has a website by that name and a channel on @entity67 , but both were offline tuesday afternoon			0

" last week , the @entity72 insisted that their website was legitimate and that they had no agenda			0
@entity9 said the couple intended to end the vote december 7 , two days before the last day @entity78 could legally get an abortion , their blog says			1
but on tuesday , @entity9 said , " we 're talking about ending it early			0
i think people are getting it			0
" @entity9 said that the site has brought the couple about $ 225 through @entity87 ads but that he 's spent $ 500 on it			1
