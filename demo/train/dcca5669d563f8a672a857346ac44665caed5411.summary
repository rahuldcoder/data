-- the battle over " @entity3 's " r rating rages on			1
@entity4 , a 17 - year - old high school student from @entity5 , delivered a petition ( with more than 200,000 signatures ) wednesday to the @entity9 's office in @entity10 , @entity11			2
her message : lower the @entity9 rating of the upcoming @entity15 documentary from @entity16 to @entity17			1
" @entity3 , " a look at the rise of adolescent bullying in @entity25 , was rated r for " some language " -- specifically for the f - word , which is used a reported six times in the film			1
an r rating means that adolescents under the age of 17 -- the documentary 's intended audience -- can not see the film without an adult guardian			1
@entity4 , who came out as a lesbian in middle school and has been the victim of repeated bullying , launched the online petition on february 26			0
since then , she has been featured on @entity38 and @entity39 , and was in the audience during today 's taping of " the @entity42 , " during which @entity43 urged her viewers to also sign the petition			0
but will all of this media attention have any effect on the @entity9 's decision ? in response to @entity53 's petition , the organization released the following statement from @entity55 , the chairman of its @entity17 : " @entity4 's efforts in bringing the issue of bullying to the forefront of a national discussion in the context of this new film are commendable and we welcome the feedback about this movie 's rating			1
the @entity9 shares @entity4 's goals of shining a light on the problem of bullying and we hope that her efforts will fuel more discussion among educators , parents , and children			1
the voluntary ratings system enables parents to make an informed decision about what content they allow their children to see in movies			0
the r rating and description of ' some language ' for @entity3 does not mean that children can not see the film			1
as with any movie , parents will decide if they want their children to see @entity3			2
school districts , similarly , handle the determination of showing movies on a case - by - case basis and have their own guidelines for parental approval			0
the r rating is not a judgment on the value of any movie			0
the rating simply conveys to parents that a film has elements strong enough to require careful consideration before allowing their children to view it			2
once advised , many parents may take their kids to see an r - rated film			2
" with " bully 's " march 30 release date quickly approaching , the @entity15 is running out of time			2
the studio lost its appeal to overturn the movie 's r rating , falling one vote short of the two - thirds requirement			2
as a result , the company was left with three options : ( 1 ) release " @entity3 " as is with an r rating ; ( 2 ) edit or mute the profanity in order to obtain a pg - 13 rating ; or ( 3 ) release the film without a @entity9 rating , which could result in some theaters treating " @entity3 " as though it were actually rated @entity129 - 17			1
the film 's director , @entity130 , has already voiced his opposition to making any edits			1
" to cut around [ the profanity ] or bleep it out , it really absolutely does lessen the impact and takes away from what the honest moment was , and what a terrifying feeling it can be [ to be bullied ] , " @entity130 told the @entity134 and the @entity15 believes an r rating would similarly diminish the film 's influence on adolescents			1
" if your parents take you or make you go [ to the movie ] , it 's like forcing a child to take medicine , " @entity146 , the studio 's coo , told @entity0			0
" but if a kid has the ability where he can go on his own , it becomes a movement			0
that 's one of the reasons why we need this rating changed			0
" so far , the @entity15 has n't decided how to move forward with " bully , " besides the decision to continue keeping pressure on the @entity9			1
" we 're contemplating all options right now regarding what 's best for the movie , " said @entity146			0
" in an ideal world , it 'd be great if the @entity9 would say , ' look , they got the majority vote , and in context , [ the film 's language ] is fine			1
' and then everybody goes on their way and we 're able to get a very powerful movie out the door			0
