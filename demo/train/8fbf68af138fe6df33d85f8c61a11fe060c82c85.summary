-- @entity3 , the one - time @entity5 enfant terrible who portrayed such indelible characters as " @entity9 's " biker @entity8 and " @entity10 's " huffing villain @entity11 , died of prostate cancer saturday morning at his home in @entity14 , @entity15 , his wife said			1
@entity3 , who was diagnosed with prostate cancer last october , was surrounded by his children when he died , his wife , @entity16 , told @entity0			1
funeral arrangements have not been decided , but @entity3 's wish was to be buried in @entity21 , @entity22 , " his heart home , " @entity16 said			1
the @entity27 film icon made his last public appearance on march 26 , 2010 , when his star was dedicated on @entity5 's @entity30			1
over almost six decades as a performer and director , his career spanned a range of @entity5 trends : @entity45 's live " @entity44 , " films about disillusioned teenagers , a variety of @entity39 , anti-establishment dramas , offbeat indie films , action blockbusters and edgy cable series			1
he often played villains , occasionally lost souls , almost all with a force and empathy			0
share your tributes , memories of @entity3 there was @entity3 before " @entity9 , " generally known as a clean - cut , if rebellious , character actor who had built a career of supporting roles in @entity39 , youth - oriented films and tv shows			1
there was @entity3 after " @entity9 , " for years one of @entity5 's wild men , an actor with a penchant for alcohol , drugs and outlandish behavior , and later a go - to performer to play villains and commanding misfits			1
and then there was " @entity9 , " the 1969 film that he directed and co-wrote , and in which he played a dissolute , countercultural biker named @entity8			1
thanks to the film , @entity3 helped blaze a trail for the young , aggressive filmmakers who would take @entity5 by storm in the 1970s			1
@entity3 was born in @entity80 , @entity81 , on may 17 , 1936			1
he grew up in @entity82 , @entity15 , and established an early reputation for stage work			1
making his way to @entity5 while still in his teens , he quickly earned roles in tv shows and films , including " @entity91 " ( 1955 ) , in which he met @entity92 , who became a friend and lifelong model , @entity3 once said			1
@entity92 was " a guerrilla artist who attacked all restrictions on his sensibility			0
... i imitated his style in art and in life			0
it got me in a lot of trouble , " @entity3 recalled			1
@entity3 also appeared in " @entity105 " with @entity92 , who died in a car accident in september 1955			2
" he 's the greatest actor that i ever saw			2
i never saw anyone that could even touch him , " he told @entity0 's @entity107 in 2005			2
" he moved better than any actor			0
he 's like an expressionist to me			0
he not only filled himself with emotion , but he , like -- he did things that were so unbelievably physical			0
" @entity3 maintained a somewhat uneven career through the mid- ' 60s , appearing in such films as the @entity118 vehicle " @entity122 " ( 1965 ) and the @entity120 classic " @entity123 " ( 1967 ) as well as several tv shows -- often @entity39			1
but it was 1967 's psychedelic " @entity125 , " directed by " @entity127 's " @entity126 , that exposed the actor to an anti-establishment audience and two of his " @entity9 " colleagues , actor @entity133 and " trip " writer @entity134			1
in early 1968 , @entity3 led the group through his own low - budget film , a biker road movie about two disenchanted riders who -- thanks to some drug money -- travel from @entity143 to @entity144			1
" a man went looking for @entity149 and could n't find it anywhere , " went the words of its famous tagline			0
" @entity9 " was finally released in the summer of 1969 , and became a sensation -- after 1967 's " @entity153 " and " @entity152 , " the breakthrough that set free the @entity156 generation on @entity5			1
( ironically , another of @entity3 's 1969 films was " @entity160 , " an old - fashioned @entity39 that earned @entity118 an @entity159			1
) the film , made on the fly by @entity3 and co-star @entity163 for less than $ 500,000 , became one of the highest - grossing movies of its time and helped make a star of @entity134 , who played an ill - fated , alcoholic lawyer			1
" it was just a very special time when the lunatics really got to take over the asylum for a minute , " @entity3 told @entity169 in 2008			2
" for a brief moment there , there really seemed to be an independent film movement			0
" @entity178 captures @entity30 ceremony but even at the height of " rider 's " success , @entity3 was developing a reputation as a difficult artist , using drugs and drinking heavily			1
he and @entity163 -- best friends in the movie -- were n't that way in real life , he told people in 2002			0
" @entity191 were n't friends			0
by the time we started the film , @entity191 tried to have me fired			0
he considered me out of control , and i was , " @entity3 said			2
" we made a good film , but it was n't made out of love			0
" given carte blanche to direct his next movie , @entity3 made " @entity199 " ( 1971 ) an indulgent failure that made the list of the @entity204 brothers ' " @entity202 " in their 1978 book of that name			2
@entity3 descended into drug and alcohol abuse in the ' 70s			2
a marriage to @entity210 and @entity212 singer @entity211 famously lasted eight days in 1970 , and he barely sustained his career as an actor , though he gave a notable turn as the crazed photographer in @entity218 's " @entity217 " ( 1979 )			2
" the alcohol was awful			0
i was a terrible alcoholic , " @entity3 told @entity221 ' @entity220			2
" i mean , people used to ask how much drugs i did			0
i said , ' i only do drugs so i can drink more			0
' i was doing the coke so i could drink more			0
i mean , i do n't know any other reason			0
i 'd start drinking in the morning			0
i 'd drink all day long			0
" after hitting bottom -- he had a breakdown in a @entity27 jungle -- @entity3 entered rehab in the early ' 80s , and his career began a renaissance			1
he was determined to do 1986 's " @entity10 , " about the sordid underbelly of a small town , reportedly telling writer and director @entity236 , " i 've got to play this part , @entity238 , because i am @entity11			1
" @entity11 -- fond of profanity , @entity240 and inhaling a mysterious gas -- earned @entity3 wide acclaim			2
he received a best supporting actor @entity159 nomination for his next film , " @entity248 " ( 1986 ) , in which he played the drunken father of a high school basketball player			2
@entity3 never strayed far from the a-list after that , giving notable turns in " @entity254 " ( 1994 ) , " " @entity255 " ( 1996 ) , " @entity250 " ( 1999 ) and the tv show " crash			1
" @entity256 : @entity3 became honorary mayor in 2009 in recent years , @entity3 was as well known for his political views -- he self - identified as a @entity259 in liberal @entity5 -- as his work			1
( he did play a @entity262 presidential candidate in 2008 's " swing vote , " however			0
) among his recent roles were a villain in the tv series " 24 " and an officer in the short - lived tv show " e-ring			1
" he was starring in the tv version of the @entity159 - winning film " crash " at his death , playing a conniving record producer			2
he was named a chevalier of @entity276 's @entity275 in 2008			0
@entity3 was married five times and had four children , ranging in age from 47 to 6			2
his personal life continued its ups and downs to the end			0
in january , while @entity3 was suffering from prostate cancer , he filed for divorce from his fifth wife , @entity286			1
@entity3 's lawyer argued in the divorce case that his estranged wife 's presence was hampering his fight with cancer , but the judge allowed her to continue living in the family 's @entity14 compound with their daughter			1
but it 's his films for which he 'll be remembered -- and there was something for everybody , he told @entity303 in 2002			0
" i can be in the 24 - hour grocery store at midnight , and suddenly someone come up and says , ' man , you know i loved you in ' @entity310 2 , ' " @entity3 said with a laugh			2
" well , ' @entity311 ' is not my favorite film to be remembered for			0
then there was ' @entity248 , ' which was a very likable , inspirational sports film			0
kids will come up asking for the coach 's autograph			0
" somewhere in my strange career , someone has liked something			0
" @entity0 's @entity321 contributed to this report .			0
