@entity0 -- @entity3 died because dr. @entity4 failed to notice that his patient had stopped breathing while he was hooked up to an iv drip of the surgical anesthetic propofol , an expert anesthesiologist testified thursday			1
dr. @entity9 , probably the last witness before the prosecution rests in dr. @entity4 's involuntary manslaughter trial , said @entity4 should have realized @entity3 had stopped breathing about 11:45 a.m. on june 25 , 2009			1
" when you 're there , you see it , you know it , " @entity9 said			0
phone records and testimony showed that @entity4 was on the phone with one of his clinics , a patient , and then a girlfriend about the time that @entity9 calculated the oxygen in @entity3 's lungs became depleted , causing his heart to stop beating			1
" had @entity4 been with @entity3 during this period of time , he would have seen the slowed breathing and the compromise in the flow of air into @entity3 's lungs , and he could have easily turned off the propofol infusion , " @entity9 said			1
@entity4 could have then easily cleared @entity3 's airways and restored his breathing by lifting his chin , he said			1
earlier testimony from paramedics and emergency room doctors said @entity3 was clinically dead by the time an ambulance arrived at the pop icon 's @entity0 home nearly a half - hour after @entity4 realized there was a problem			1
the last three prosecution experts , all medical experts , focused the @entity4 trial on the science surrounding @entity3 's death , a contrast to earlier testimony from @entity4 's girlfriends and @entity3 employees			1
after the defense cross-examination of @entity9 on friday afternoon , @entity4 's lawyers will start calling witnesses , including their own anesthesiology expert			1
@entity9 demonstrated for the jury how he believed @entity4 set up the propofol infusion by hanging a 100 - milliliter vial from a stand with tubing attached that would have led to a catheter port in @entity3 's left leg			1
" this is the only scenario that i could generate " that would produce the high level of propofol found @entity3 's blood during his autopsy , @entity9 said			2
" this fits all of the data in this case , and i am not aware of any data that is consistent , " he said			0
@entity9 examined and ruled out other scenarios , including @entity3 injecting himself with propofol or @entity4 administering a fatal dose with a syringe			2
computer model projections could not identify a scenario that would duplicate the high blood levels found , he said			0
although @entity4 told police he used an iv drip to give @entity3 propofol on previous nights , the defense contends that he did not use it the day @entity3 died			1
instead , they say , @entity4 put @entity3 to sleep about 10:40 a.m. with a single injection			2
sometime after that , @entity3 woke and used a syringe to inject himself , the defense contends , @entity9 said the theory makes no sense			2
" people just do n't wake up hell bent to grab the next dose in a syringe , draw it up and shove it in their iv again , " @entity9 said			0
" it 's just a crazy scenario			2
" the @entity104 coroner ruled that @entity3 's death was caused by a combination of sedatives with the propofol , which @entity4 admitted in a police interview that he used to help @entity3 sleep			1
the defense contends that @entity3 swallowed eight lorazepam tablets , a claim based on testing of lorazepam levels in @entity3 's stomach contents			2
@entity9 discredited the defense lab tests , saying a new test showed the equivalent of only " 1/43rd of a tablet " of the sedative in the stomach			0
the level of lorazepam in @entity3 's blood was far higher than what would be expected based on the dosages dr. @entity4 told detectives he gave @entity3 in the hours before his death , @entity9 said			1
@entity4 said he gave @entity3 a total of 4 milligrams of lorazepam in two separate doses starting 10 hours before his death			2
toxicology results indicated that @entity3 was given 40 milligrams -- not four -- in a series of 10 doses , he said			0
although the defense recently abandoned the theory that @entity3 may have swallowed propofol , the prosecution still worked to use its old theory to discredit dr. @entity142 , the anesthesiologist who will testify soon for the defense			1
a report prepared by @entity142 in march concluded that oral ingestion of propofol could have killed @entity3 , but @entity9 testified that it ignores the " first pass effect " that is taught to first - year medical students			1
the liver is a " powerful mechanism " for filtering propofol from the digestive tract so that only a very small percentage can reach the blood , @entity9 said			0
@entity9 cited several studies on rats , mice , piglets , dogs , monkeys and humans that he said proves swallowing propofol would have no effect			0
" there was no sedation at anytime following oral consumption of propofol , " @entity9 said , describing the results of research he commissioned on university students in @entity167 over the summer			0
the human study was done not only to prepare for the @entity3 trial , @entity9 said , but also to counter an effort by the @entity175 to consider tighter restrictions on propofol			0
the drug is not currently a controlled substance , but publicity over the theory that @entity3 's death might have been caused by oral ingestion prompted federal regulators to considered a new requirement that " it to be handled almost like morphine , " he said			2
" patients will be hurt if it is restricted , " he said			0
" anesthesiologists have to have ready access			0
" the new study assures that if the drug is abused , it would be done only with the intravenous route , which only health care providers have , he said			0
@entity9 testified wednesday that @entity3 would be alive now but for 17 " egregious deviations " by @entity4 from the standard of care required of physicians			0
@entity4 's use of propofol almost every night for two months to help @entity3 sleep was so unusual , there is no documentation on the dangers , @entity9 said			1
" we are in pharmacological never - neverland here , " @entity9 said , " something that 's only been done to @entity3			0
" the trial , in its fourth week , is expected to conclude with the start of jury deliberations near the end of next week .			0
