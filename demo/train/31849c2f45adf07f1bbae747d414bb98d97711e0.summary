-- @entity1 has moved quickly to deny claims its president , @entity3 , suggested @entity4 is unfit to host the @entity5 -- despite his admission that it was " a mistake " to schedule a summer tournament in the @entity8			1
@entity3 , who oversees the game 's global governing body , appeared to cast doubt over @entity4 's right to welcome the football world , following an interview with a @entity16 television station friday			1
when asked by @entity17 if it was an error to award @entity4 the @entity5 , @entity3 said : " of course , it was a mistake			1
you know , one makes a lot of mistakes in life			0
" the technical report indicated clearly that it was too hot in summer , but despite that the executive committee decided , with quite a big majority , that the tournament would be in @entity4			1
" in october 2013 , @entity3 set up an executive committee taskforce to examine whether the @entity5 in @entity4 should be switched to winter because of extreme summer temperatures			1
a decision is expected to be made following the conclusion of the upcoming @entity5 in @entity32			2
@entity3 's comments sparked a frenzy on social media and led to criticism of the 78 - year - old and the organization 's decision to award the tournament to @entity4			1
but speaking to @entity0 , a @entity1 spokesman said : " the comment by the @entity1 president concerning the organization of the @entity5 in @entity4 to @entity16 tv station @entity17 is in line with previous comments on this matter			1
" as explained in his answer to the journalist , the president reiterated that the decision to organize the @entity5 in summer was an ' error ' based on the technical assessment report of the bid , which had highlighted the extremely hot temperatures in summer in @entity4			1
" at no stage did he question @entity4 as the host of the @entity5			1
" @entity59 led the @entity1 inspection team which examined each of the bidding countries for the @entity5 before delivering his report in october 2010			1
@entity59 concluded that @entity4 was a high - risk option because of its soaring temperatures -- but it was still chosen by 14 of the 22 executive committee members in the final round of voting in december that year			2
" in june and july you can not play , " @entity59 told @entity0 last november when asked about the conditions in @entity4			2
" it 's not for the players			0
the players will be ok with the cooling system but what about the fans ? " you 'll have 50,000 fans walking three , four , even six blocks or more like in @entity80 where i walked 10 blocks			0
" they will be walking in 40 degrees and it 's too much			0
one or two crucial cases will damage the entire image of the @entity5 and we must be careful			2
" if the @entity5 was to be held between november and january , it would probably create a logistical headache for many major @entity91 leagues -- such as the @entity92 -- and for the prestigious @entity93 , organized by the continent 's @entity95 confederation			0
@entity99 broadcaster @entity97 , which paid $ 425 million for the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 tournaments , has expressed concern that a " winter " @entity5 could clash with the @entity104 's regular season and the @entity105			0
the decision to award @entity4 football 's showpiece event has drawn widespread condemnation and focused attention on workers ' rights in the state			0
a report released by @entity115 last november alleged that the abuse of migrant workers was rife within @entity4 's construction sector , while @entity121 newspaper @entity119 likened the conditions for such workers to " modern - day slavery			0
" the furor which surrounded " stranded " footballer @entity126 also raised questions regarding @entity4 's @entity129 law			0
@entity3 himself described the conditions for migrant workers in @entity4 as " unacceptable , " but has so far refused to entertain the idea of moving the 2022 competition to another location			2
in response to @entity115 's allegations , the director of the @entity137 at @entity4 's @entity138 said laws are in place to protect workers from mistreatment .			0
