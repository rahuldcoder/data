-- " did you hear the news ? @entity8 came out , " i heard one guy tell another on the elevator at the magazine where i work			1
" is it really ' coming out ' when everyone already knew you were gay ? " the other guy joked			1
to media insiders in @entity14 , @entity8 's sexuality may have been no secret , but to the rest of the world , his romantic inclinations were a mystery -- an ever - present and provocative question mark			1
as an out lesbian and journalist , i 've always felt conflicted about the uncertainty of @entity8 's sexuality			1
on the one hand , i can delight in the mystery of a person 's unspoken and enigmatic preferences , wondering : is he gay ? straight ? @entity29 ? maybe he 's asexual			1
on the other , before he came out i could n't help but wonder if he 'd felt the need to veil his homosexuality to make himself palatable to the masses			2
it 's irksome to think that he 'd have to cater to the ignorant until he could secure a large following			2
hopefully his coming out will blast the perception that you ca n't be openly gay and a widely respected public figure			1
when i put on my journalistic hat , i can definitely vouch for his point in an e-mail to @entity43 's @entity42 about the advantages of remaining unreadable to your interviewees			2
it 's easier to forge a bond and to gain the trust of your subjects if the conversation is n't crowded with your slant on hot - button issues			2
if they see you as neutral -- or a blank page -- they can assume ( albeit , often falsely ) that you share their core values and beliefs , which elevates their level of comfort and opens them up			0
@entity8 : the fact is , i 'm gay the truth is i can see the massive benefits of @entity8 wanting to secure his professional standing before coming out			1
as a nationally beloved commentator , he 'll successfully test the hearts and minds of viewers who may not be comfortable with homosexuality but respect and admire him			0
he could n't have managed that had he come out before amassing a large and loving audience			0
the political impact of him revealing his same - sex preferences now , as opposed to when his career first launched , are far greater			0
but even now that he 's out , i ca n't quite put away the idea that there 's something wildly subversive and compelling about people who refuse firm categorization			2
i 'd even argue that it 's more radical -- maybe even more progressive -- to resist publicly categorizing one 's sexuality , especially given the dark underbelly of those categories , which work to classify , police , target and judge bodies , particularly those imbued with desires and pleasures society terms " deviant			2
" it may unsettle people to not know whether they are looking at a lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgendered person , but in the space of uncertainty and discomfort is a possibility for growth			0
my take : will there be gays in heaven ? we 're forced out of lazy habits of thought and compelled to keep questioning and wondering when the nature of something or someone is uncertain			0
in some ways , sexual identity categories foreclose this opportunity by locking us into place and stemming the possibility of reconceiving and reimagining the world			0
that said , i know that there 's a pragmatic purpose and power in numbers and visibility -- and that gay role models are as important as ever			1
with the epidemic of bullying in our country and the shocking number of high - profile gay teen suicides in recent years , @entity8 's announcement is no small coup for gay youths			1
role models are important for all kids , but especially for those who 've been maligned and marginalized because of their difference			1
i can testify firsthand how important they were to me			0
@entity140 : the cost of coming out i did n't have any gay role models until i got to college			1
at @entity144 , in the late ' 90s , i majored in @entity145 with a concentration on gender and sexuality			0
my professors were a wild pack of queer and feminist thinkers intent on dismantling social hierarchies and trying to reassemble the world for the betterment of the misfit and mistreated			0
it was like living in a @entity159 film , where all the freaks got center stage and were made to relish their queerness and triumph in their status as outsiders			0
being in a room with an openly lesbian professor and knowing that i was valued , rather than vilified , for the ways in which i did n't fit in was a soothing antidote to all those adolescent years of self - loathing and doubt			0
when powerful pop cultural icons like @entity8 affirm their homosexuality , it serves a similar purpose for gay kids			1
they are better able to see their way toward a brighter future and drum up the strength and courage to withstand the scorn and alienation that come -- far too often -- with being gay			0
but i 'm still fixing my hopes on the day when you wo n't be marked -- for better or worse -- for whom you choose to love			0
opinion : thank you , @entity8 overheard : @entity192 , readers ' proud ' of @entity8			1

*writer* @entity194 says she 's felt conflicted about @entity8 's silence on his sexuality
as a journalist , @entity194 understands @entity8 's not wanting to become the story
as a gay youth , @entity194 found she lacked role models
she hopes @entity8 's coming out *encourages* gay youths to be proud of their identity
