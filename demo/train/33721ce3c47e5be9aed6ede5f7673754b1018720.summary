-- can we predict the future of medicine ? although designer babies and a disease - free world may or may not come to pass , you can get a glimpse of the most promising and upcoming medical innovations each year , via the @entity9			1
the clinic 's @entity11 list , which has been an annual undertaking since 2007 , contains treatments and technologies that are expected to significantly change patient care and save lives			1
to be considered , each innovation must have a good chance of being available to the public in the upcoming year , says dr. @entity20 , chief wellness officer at the @entity9 and chairman of the committee that decides the list			1
the committee must also expect it to have a significant impact on a large part of the population			0
the process starts with a panel of @entity9 physicians and scientists who submit their ideas			1
these suggestions , which @entity20 said totaled about 700 for the 2015 list , are then narrowed down and voted on by 40 physicians in a variety of health fields			1
here 's what they selected for 2015 : 1			1
mobile stroke unit videoconferencing has made its way into ambulances , specifically for treating stroke victims on the go			1
hospital stroke neurologists can interpret symptoms via a broadband video link and instruct an onboard paramedic , critical care nurse and @entity51 on treatment			2

the disease is a leading cause of death and illness in children in some countries			0
a new vaccine has been developed and tested , and is expected to be available in 2015			2
painless blood testing for those who hate large needles , a nearly painless way to sample blood will be a welcome relief			0
plus , it will be cheaper and provide faster results than today 's blood test			0
the new technology takes blood from your fingertip , and the @entity9 reports that over 100 tests can be performed on just one drop of blood			1

a welcome breakthrough in the world of cancer treatment , antibody - drug conjugates can deliver targeted treatment without damaging healthy tissue			2
immune booster for cancer patients immune checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to prevent cancer cells from " hiding " from the immune system , allowing the body to more effectively fight these abnormal cells			1
combined with chemotherapy and radiation treatment , the drugs have shown significant , long - term cancer remissions for patients with metastatic melanoma , one of the most deadly forms of cancer			1
wireless cardiac pacemaker until this point , wires have been a necessary component in pacemakers			0
a new wireless pacemaker about the size of a vitamin can now be implanted in the heart without surgery			2
its lithium - ion battery is estimated to last about seven years			0
new medications for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a life - threatening disease that causes scarring in the lungs , leading to breathing difficulties and a shortage of oxygen in the brain and other organs			0
life expectancy is only three to five years after diagnosis , but those numbers may change now that the @entity100 has approved two experimental drugs that slow the disease : pirfenidone and nintedanib			0
single - dose radiation therapy for breast cancer the @entity163 estimates that 40,000 women in the @entity165 will die from breast cancer in 2014			2
