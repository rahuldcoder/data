@entity0 -- the family of olympian @entity3 said monday they are " shaken " by the " graphic images " leaked to the media last week that purportedly show the blood - spattered bathroom where the double amputee track star fatally shot his girlfriend in february			1
" it has always been our plea that the legal process be allowed its run its course with integrity , " the @entity3 family said in a statement			1
" the leaking of evidential material into the public domain , before the court case , does not advance this process			1
" the statement comes a day before @entity3 is due to appear in court where prosecutors are expected to ask magistrates to postpone the case pending further investigations			1
@entity3 , 26 , is charged with killing girlfriend @entity28 in the early hours of february 14			1
the graphic photos of the crime scene were published by @entity31 on friday and show a trail of blood leading from a bathroom ; blood on the walls , stairs and a couch inside the house , and a @entity41 card with " @entity42 " -- @entity28 's nickname for @entity3 -- written on it			1
the photo of the bathroom shows a toilet covered in blood , a door with a missing panel and what appear to be two police - marked bullet holes below the level of the door 's handle			0
@entity1 has not been able to independently confirm the authenticity of the photos , and police spokesman @entity58 declined to comment on how @entity31 obtained the pictures			0
@entity3 , known as the " @entity3 " for competing on carbon fiber blades fitted to his amputated legs , has said he thought there was an intruder in the house			0
afraid of being attacked , he ran on his stumps to the bathroom , where he shot through the door from a relatively low angle four times			0
it was only upon returning to his bedroom , @entity3 says , that he realized @entity28 was not in bed and that she had been the one in the bathroom			2
the state alleges it was premeditated murder : @entity3 had an argument with @entity28 then put on his prosthetic legs , walked to the bathroom and shot through the door from a relatively higher angle , intentionally killing her			2
his uncle told @entity1 last week that @entity3 is a broken man over the incident and described his nephew 's grief as " unthinkable			2
" " what can you say if the person you love the most dies , and you were the instrument ? how would you feel ? it 's unthinkable , " @entity89 said			0
his family said monday they " fully stand behind @entity3			2
" " we believe in him , love him and will support him every step of the way in what lies ahead , " the statement said			0
