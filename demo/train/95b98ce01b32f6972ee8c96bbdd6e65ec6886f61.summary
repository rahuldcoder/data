-- " moments like these , terrible as they are , do n't show our weakness ; they show our strength			0
" these words were spoken by @entity6 , @entity7 , district attorney @entity8 after monday 's terror attack in @entity10			2
a day later , signs of that strength are seen in the stories of people -- you might call them heroes -- who were near the @entity18 finish line when two bombs exploded seconds apart			1
honoring a son @entity22 's story began nearly nine years ago , when he doused himself with gasoline and used a welder 's torch to set his body on fire			1
@entity22 , a @entity28 immigrant living in @entity29 , had just been told his 20 - year - old son , @entity30 cpl. @entity30 , was killed in combat in @entity32			1
@entity22 initially thought the three @entity33 pulling up to his home were bringing his son to surprise him on his 44th birthday			1
@entity22 , now 52 , recovered from his burns and became a peace activist , traveling the @entity39 with a coffin filled with his son 's possessions			1
this journey brought him to the marathon finish line to watch someone who was running in honor of his son			1
@entity22 handed out @entity39 flags to spectators			1
he wore two buttons on his shirt with photographs of @entity30 and his other son , who committed suicide at age 24			0
what happened next could have been a scene familiar to his @entity33 son : a bomb exploded			0
@entity22 is seen on video , wearing a cowboy hat , helping @entity62 troops , police and firefighters wrestle a fence open to allow emergency responders to reach the dozens of wounded people bleeding on the @entity10 sidewalk			1
once there , @entity22 found a young man -- perhaps the age of his son -- bleeding from serious leg wounds			1
" i just concentrated on that young man and tied him up , his legs , and talked to him , " @entity22 said , his hands trembling , in a video posted on @entity76			1
he used part of his clothing to make a tourniquet to slow the blood loss from the man 's severed artery			1
" he was conscious , " @entity22 said			1
" i let him know the ambulance is on the way , that it 's ok			0
" when paramedics arrived , @entity22 helped put the man in a wheelchair			1
a news photo that has become an iconic image of the tragedy shows @entity22 , his hands covered in blood , running alongside as the man is rushed to an ambulance			1
" there were so many people who lay next to me begging me for help , begging me for help , but i only can help one at a time , " he said			0
" so i just helped that young man			2
" the man told arredondo his name , but he could n't remember it later			0
hours later , he still held on to an @entity39 flag , now stained with blood			0
running to help dr. @entity111 was 25 yards away from finishing the 26.2 - mile run when the first bomb exploded to his left			1
he was n't sure " whether it was the fireworks gone bad or something that was supposed to happen , " @entity111 said tuesday			2
" then , after the second explosion went off , we knew something was wrong because all of the spectators and fans started running away from us , " @entity111 said			2
@entity111 's story represents the heroism of many other medical professionals who were close by when the terror began : doctors , nurses and paramedics who were running , spectators in the stands or waiting at the finish line to treat exhausted runners			1
sources : bombs were likely in pressure cookers " my whole family was on that side where the explosions had gone off , " @entity111 said			2
" so i started running towards where the bombs had gone off to check on my family and see if there was anything i could do to help			0
" what he found on the sidewalk was beyond anything he 's seen as an orthopedic surgeon			0
" it 's nothing that you can ever describe , " he said			0
" in all of my medical training , i 've never seen anything like the amount of trauma i saw yesterday on the sidewalk there			0
" when @entity111 reached the wounded , he was not alone			1
" by the time i got there , there were so many first responders and volunteer physicians , " he said			0
" i 've never seen anything like it in terms of the quickness of the response to that tragedy			0
" time is vital in saving lives , according to @entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity171			2
doctors call the first 60 minutes the " golden hour " in trauma response , he said			0
within the first 15 minutes , 15 patients were at @entity176 , a @entity178 trauma center , @entity171 said			0
seven operating rooms were immediately cleared for the nine patients needing surgery , he said			0
already a hero @entity183 could be called a hero even before monday			1
the former @entity186 lineman helps children with brain cancer and their families pay for their treatments through his foundation			0
the @entity192 had a team of runners in the @entity18 to raise money to help more patients			2
@entity183 , who was near the finish line when the bombs exploded , rushed to help , along with many others			1
when football fans recognized him in photos , carrying a wounded woman to a triage tent , @entity183 was quick to downplay his role			1
" while i appreciate the interest in hearing our perspective on today 's horrific events , the spotlight should remain firmly on the countless individuals -- first responders , medics , @entity213 , runners who crossed the finish line and kept on running straight to give blood , and the countless civilians who did whatever they could to save lives , " he said in a statement monday			0
" they were the true heroes			0
our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected by this senseless tragedy			0

@entity240 -- he did n't give her last name -- was scared and , " as she described it , hysterical " when a firefighter carried her to the medical tent near the finish line , @entity237 said at a news conference tuesday			2
" there was a person who helped calm her down , who described himself as an @entity254 sergeant , an @entity255 vet , " @entity237 said			0
" i do n't know whether he was assigned to medical tent or , like so many people there and elsewhere in the commonwealth , just jumped in to help			2
" @entity236 helped @entity240 in a way few people could			1
" one of things he said to her to calm her down was to show her his own shrapnel wound or scar from ... when he was in @entity255 , " he said			0
an ambulance took @entity240 to @entity239 , but her memory of @entity236 followed			2
" @entity240 very , very much wants to thank @entity236 personally , " @entity237 said			2
" so , if @entity236 is out there and listening or reading your reports , we would love to hear from @entity236 so that we can connect him to @entity240			2
