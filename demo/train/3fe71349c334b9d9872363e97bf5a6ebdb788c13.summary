-- investigators found " widespread cracking " on the skin of a @entity6 @entity5 that made an emergency landing in @entity8 after a hole opened on top of the aircraft during flight friday , a @entity2 member said sunday			1
a flight attendant received minor injuries when the hole opened and the cabin depressurized 18 minutes after the plane took off from @entity19 bound for @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity2 member @entity22 told reporters			1
the flight data recorder indicated the plane was cruising at 36,000 feet when it depressurized , but it dropped to 11,000 within 4 1/2 minutes , @entity22 said			1
the pilot initially planned to return to @entity19 to land , but after the flight attendants reported seeing blue sky through the jet 's roof he made an emergency landing at a military base in @entity33 , @entity8 , @entity22 said			1
the initial inspection found " clear evidence that the skin separated at the lower rivet line " where " the skin comes together on the aircraft , " @entity22 said			1
the cracking would likely not be visible during routine inspections , but could have been seen when the plane underwent major maintenance and was disassembled in march 2010 , @entity22 said			1
the hole that opened up was 5 feet long and 1 foot wide , he said			1
southwest mechanics cut away the section of the plane containing the hole and are sending it overnight to the @entity2 laboratory in @entity50 , the board said			1
@entity6 grounded 79 of its planes for inspection for " aircraft skin fatigue " saturday			1
as of sunday afternoon , 19 planes were returned to service after " intense inspection , " the airline said in a statement			1
however , " small , subsurface cracks " or indications of cracks were detected in three other aircraft			1
" further evaluation and potential repairs will be necessary before those planes are returned to service , " the statement said			1
the additional cracks found sunday were no more than 1/4 inch in size , the @entity2 said			1
the inspections of the remaining aircraft are expected to be completed by late tuesday			2
@entity5 is sending a service bulletin to airlines with recommendations for how to inspect their planes for similar cracks , the @entity2 said sunday			1
@entity6 canceled about 300 flights saturday and sunday to accommodate the inspections			1
it advised customers to check the status of their particular flight or rebook their trip before heading to the airport			2
representatives from the @entity2 , the @entity85 , @entity5 and the airline organized into teams to investigate the aircraft 's structure , metallurgical aspects of the plane , flight data recordings and its maintenance records , @entity22 said			1
meanwhile , some of the 118 passengers who were aboard the crippled @entity5 said they had feared for their lives			2
" we were in shock , " passenger @entity97 told @entity0 saturday			2
" we were in row 16 and my husband and i could see blue sky ... the wiring , the cabling			2
" she said , " a lot of people were crying and holding hands " but had trouble hearing due to the noise of air rushing through the plane 's opening			2
" it was very , very scary			2
" " i heard a loud popping sound about three or four minutes before it blew open on us , " passenger @entity114 said			2
" ( then ) a big explosion happened			2
a big noise , and from there , you felt some of the air being sucked out			0
it happened right behind me , in the row behind me and it covers about 2 1/2 rows , " he said from seat @entity123			0
@entity114 , 41 , a regional sales manager for a biotech company , was flying home to @entity20 , @entity21 , from a business trip			0
some people panicked and screamed as the blue sky and sun began to shine through the cabin in midflight , he said			0
" most people were just white knuckles holding onto the arm rests			0
the pilots did a great job and were under control to get us to a manageable level , " he said			0
but just behind him , @entity114 said he could see the jagged edge of the aircraft where the rivets used to be			0
" you can see the insulation and wiring			0
the interior ceiling panel was bouncing up and down with the air , " he said			0
" it was surreal , when you 're riding in a modern aircraft			0
you 're used to being enclosed and not having the window rolled down , " he said			0
passenger @entity155 told @entity0 affiliates @entity158 and @entity159 she began to fear for her life			0
" i was texting my sister to make certain that she told my kids that i loved them , " @entity155 said			0
@entity163 , which had a five - member crew , then made an emergency landing at @entity167 at 5:07 p.m. ( 7:07 p.m. et. ) the @entity85 said the captain made a rapid , controlled descent from 36,000 feet to about 11,000 feet after the cabin lost pressure			0
@entity6 said it provided a full refund , an apology and two complimentary round - trip passes on the airline for future flights			1
the second flight landed in @entity20 on friday night			0
@entity5 spokeswoman @entity178 declined to comment on possible causes of the incident			0

" small , subsurface cracks " found in three other @entity6 planes
fatigue where " the skin comes together " would not be *easily* seen by mechanics , the @entity2 says
