-- a president 's most solemn duty is to protect @entity3 and her people -- a responsibility that , in a time of evolving security threats and unsustainable debt , will only grow harder for the next administration			1
in the aftermath of the failure of the super committee , we are facing cuts in defense			1
yet there has still been little discussion about overall defense spending priorities and how we must transform our defense infrastructure for the 21st century			2
some of my opponents suggest maintaining the status quo , thus avoiding the tough decisions			2
others advocate retrenchment and isolationism through draconian across - the - board cuts , which brings greater instability and risks			1
still others revert to the oft - repeated pledge to eliminate waste , fraud and abuse from the @entity35 -- a worthy cause yet one of minimal consequence			2
cutting wasteful spending alone amounts to only pennies on the dollar and leaves in place the same archaic defense infrastructure			1
these approaches miss the target in two respects			2
first , they let resources drive strategy , rather than using strategy to drive force structure and capabilities			1
second , they fail to fundamentally alter our defense posture -- so any short - term savings will be quickly erased			2
in recognition of the growing asymmetrical threats we face and the evolving requirements of counterterrorism , we need a different set of capabilities			1
the world may have seen its last heavy armor battle between two nation - states			1
the relative importance of counterterrorism , intelligence , training and equipping foreign security forces , and special forces operations will continue to grow			2
our forces must be designed appropriately			2
this means a greater focus on intelligence gathering and more agile special forces units , which can respond swiftly and firmly to terrorist threats in any corner of the globe			1
we must be prepared to respond to threats -- from @entity80 and other terrorist cells -- that emanate from a much more diverse geography , including @entity83 , the @entity84 , @entity85 and the @entity86			1
we must also transform our orientation			2
by almost any objective measure -- population , economic power , military might , energy use -- the center of gravity of global human activity is moving toward the @entity86			2
embracing this reality may bring a dramatic change to the look of our military			0
the @entity86 is a maritime theater whereas @entity101 was mostly a land theater			0
for the @entity3 , the @entity86 features a collection of bilateral military alliances in contrast to our involvement with the multilateral @entity108 in @entity101			1
we are a @entity110 nation living in a @entity111 , and our vital interests in that region can not be compromised			0
we can cut our base force and transition more responsibility for contingency operations to our @entity117 and @entity118			0
in addition to being our most precious and valuable resource , our troops are also the most expensive part of our military			1
if we simultaneously transform our capabilities and posture while enhancing our guard and @entity118 , our active duty army could be reduced to around 450,000 troops , from the approximately 565,000 we now have			1
our @entity35 civilian work force can also be cut by 5 % to 7 % of its current size			0
at the same time , we should conduct a global posture review with the goal of closing at least 50 overseas military installations			0
the @entity3 military maintains more than 700 installations outside the @entity3 , the vast majority of which were opened during the @entity138			1
with a more mobile and flexible force , we simply do n't need as many facilities overseas			0
we must risk @entity3 blood and treasure overseas only when there exists a vital national security interest			1
i have consistently called for our troops to return from @entity145 as soon as possible			1
but i also believe president @entity146 has been too quick to commit forces to other missions not core to our security interests			0
within the same week of announcing a troop drawdown in @entity151 , the president announced a deployment of a small number of combat forces to @entity155 -- an unnecessarily risky and costly mission			0
@entity3 alone can not police the world			1
we should increase burden - sharing for the protection of the global commons among countries that share our values and security objectives			0
unfortunately , we are not the only democracy stuck in a @entity138 mentality			0
it is time for countries such as @entity168 and @entity169 to play a greater role in regional security matters			0
we must also throw out the old map and forge new security arrangements with regional partners such as @entity175 and @entity176			0
as we prepare to fight in the new battle spaces , we need to let go of old " sacred cows			0
" our military and defense establishment must be effective in the cybersphere , dominant in space and able to handle the increasingly lethal and accurate ballistic and cruise missiles being acquired by many of our potential foes			0
this will likely mean trade - offs away from heavy armor units , fighter air wings and aircraft carriers toward a more advanced cyberwarfare infrastructure , more capable unmanned aerial vehicles and more flexible sea - based assets			0
for @entity3 to remain a global force for good , we must maintain the world 's most capable military			1
and being the best is not simply a function of spending the most			0
staying on top will increasingly depend on our willingness to adapt to the realities of the 21st century security environment			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			1

@entity204 : presidents must place priority on protecting @entity3
he says new threats and *budget* cuts will make the task harder for next presidency
@entity204 says *smarter* strategy could enable @entity3 to make do with fewer troops , bases
he says @entity3 alone can not police the world
