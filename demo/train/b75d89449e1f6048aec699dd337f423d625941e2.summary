-- stereotypes can rumble around in our collective brains for decades , sometimes centuries , before finally being edged out by a more nuanced understanding of reality			1
it 's been that way with our views about race , creed , sexual orientation and gender roles			1
the @entity14 's announcement this week that it has changed the definition of rape to include men is one such step on the long road to better understanding			1
the last few years have seen a growing shift in the way men are perceived , under the collective weight of celebrity bad boys , stay - at - home dads , written scholarship on the supposed " end of men , " an epidemic of male incarceration , two decade - long wars fought mostly by men and a nascent men 's movement that is not about proclaiming male power but male capacity for depth and goodness			1
we see men rejecting the stick - figure representation of manhood that gets played out in @entity42			2
we 've gone from " @entity43 " to " @entity44 " in no more than a couple of tv seasons			0
at the front line of this transition is men 's understanding of what it means to be a victim			1
historically , rape has been viewed narrowly as a crime against women			2
when i interviewed the first victim to come forward in the @entity61 sex - abuse scandal in @entity62 , he legally was n't talking about rape			1
nor were the countless other men we have featured on the @entity65 who have been sexually assaulted			2
why ? because of the belief that real men do n't get raped			2
but in fact they do			0
what we know from working with thousands of men in our community of readers and writers is that men are often ashamed to come forward and say they were raped			2
as the victim in @entity62 told me : " i do n't think that people in general realize the long - term effects that it has on people			0
i think some people think just , ok , that happened 20 - 40 years ago			0
buck up , things happen			0
" for some victims of male attackers , homosexual rape adds a layer of shame and confusion to the violent trauma itself			1
then there is the misperception that men 's sex drives are so high that they " must have liked it " when forced to have sex with a woman or even another man			1
there is a completely antiquated and inaccurate assumption around male sexuality and how damaging forced sexual contact is no matter who you are			0
without acknowledgement that rape of men exists , there is less help and support for them to overcome the trauma			1
the very reason for the @entity14 's decision is to more accurately count rapes and to better allocate government resources , which up until now did not include programs to help male rape victims			1
sexual abuse often follows a tragic pattern in which a victim , if left untreated , ends up becoming an attacker			2
the fact that so many rapists were themselves abused does n't excuse their behavior			0
but as a society we have to break the silence about victims to break the cycle of abuse			0
clearly , there are still far more women who are raped than men			0
but justice is no zero - sum game			0
acknowledging male suffering does n't diminish the need to stop sexual violence against women			0
it just sheds a stereotype that no longer serves men or women			0
for men to be thinking hard about how to be better fathers and husbands can only benefit women , as can the acknowledgment that men are all too often victims of rape			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity158 .			1

@entity158 : @entity160 's including men in definition of rape *challenges* stereotypes
he says this *reflects* a growing shift in perceptions about men , in media and the social realm
he says the *priest* abuse scandal has helped confront the reality of victimized males
@entity158 : rape of men must be acknowledged for men to be given help overcoming trauma
