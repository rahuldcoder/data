-- so is this the " new normal " ? that 's the question i keep hearing as people try to comprehend the tragedy at the @entity6 and its chaotic aftermath			1
the answer is yes -- in more ways than you might think			2
i do n't mean that we 're supposed to get used to explosions , school shootings and other threats arising seemingly randomly and without warning			1
but we should accept that the old ways of understanding and responding to conflicts and threats no longer apply			1
in an always - on , post-narrative age , 24 - hour cable and internet news and @entity23 feeds offer a steady stream of opportunities for panic and misinformation			1
we have a suspect ; no , we do n't ; yes , we do			1
the school is on lockdown ; no , it 's not			2
false alarms are still alarms , after all			2
it 's like we are all living in newsrooms , or as 911 operators or air - traffic controllers , for all the emergency interruptions and bulletins we navigate practically every hour			1
then consider the equally unnerving limbo we endure once there 's nothing new to report			2
the stakes are too high to return to regular programming , so we just sit there , poised on high alert along with the police and journalists			0
this time , it was flashing blue lights and the search for a suspect			1
before that , it was the live feed of @entity56 in the corner of the screen for weeks , belching oil into the sea			0
whether interruptive or chronic , the anxiety keeps pouring in			1
we live in a state of " present shock			1
" that was the week from hell and even if network anchors still had the authority they once did , they would not be able construct a satisfying story around the onslaught of neverending news			0
when the journalists cheered as the police caught the marathon bombings suspect in the boat , it seemed that they were mostly relieved at reaching a definitive conclusion to a neverending news cycle			0
one news anchor actually declared " justice won " as she was at last permitted to cut to commercial			0
it rang false , because there 's no genuine finality anymore			0
the story just does n't end			1
for it 's not so much a matter of responding to a particular crisis , threat or tragedy but of coping with the persistent flow of urgency itself			0
some of the unease we feel with the @entity98 bombings comes from the nagging sense that we have no way of gauging where we are in the arc of violence			0
is this the beginning of a new series of attacks , a rare event like the @entity109 bombing or part of some greater conspiracy yet to be revealed ? of course , none of the usual narratives apply , for we no longer live in a world with beginnings , middles and ends			0
that quaint structure went out with the @entity118 and the moon shot			0
we no longer design career paths ; we no longer invest in the future			0
we occupy ; we freelance ; we trade derivatives			0
everything happens in the now			0
while there are certainly groups such as @entity128 with political goals and a modicum of organization , for every plotted attack with strategic goals , there are many more that arise haphazardly , randomly -- by either sympathizers , copycats or mentally ill nihilists with no political justification whatsoever			2
@entity98 's week of terror we 're no longer fighting enemies in the normal sense			1
we can not begin a war on terrorism and then declare victory when we 're done			0
we ca n't stick a flag in it and call it won			2
no , the challenges of a post-industrial society are less like conquests with clear endpoints than they are steady - state concerns			1
crises are never quite solved for the future so much as managed in the present			2
but accepting the essentially plotless and ongoing nature of crisis need n't compromise our ability to respond appropriately and effectively			1
in fact , by freeing ourselves from the obsolete narratives we used to rely on , we can begin to recognize the patterns in the apparent chaos			0
we may not get answers to rally around or satisfyingly dramatic finales , but neither will we need to invent compelling , false stories to motivate ourselves into action			0
in a world where crises are constant and perpetual , we might as well begin to develop more sustainable approaches to solving them in real time , rather than once and for all			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity176 .			1

@entity176 : new normal is constant info stream ; we do n't really know how to respond
he says terror attack *coverage* kept us in state of unending anxiety with little understanding
he says new era of 24/7 crises offers steady - state concerns rather than ones with endpoint
@entity176 : we might as well develop sustainable approaches to solving crises in real time
