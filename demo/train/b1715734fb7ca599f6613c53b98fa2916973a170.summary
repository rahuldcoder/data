-- when an elected official whose heart seems to be in the right place offers a courageous perspective on an important subject , i 'm inclined to try to find some good in it			2
but in the case of @entity11 's off - the - cuff statement that police officers across the country should threaten to go on strike until citizens pressure lawmakers to pass more gun control laws , the search was arduous			1
after a shooting rampage at a movie theater in @entity19 , @entity20 , that killed 12 people and wounded 58 others , @entity11 said this on @entity0 's " @entity24 " : " i do n't understand why the police officers across this country do n't stand up collectively and say we 're going to go on strike			1
we 're not going to protect you unless you , the public , through your legislature , do what 's required to keep us safe			2
apparently , @entity11 forgot a couple of things			1
like the fact that , in @entity37 , a law specifically prohibits police officers from putting public safety at risk by going on strike			1
or that pulling police officers off the streets would likely lead to more gun violence , not less			1
or that while a private citizen can say something like that , the mayor of @entity46 's largest city needs to choose his words more responsibly			2
the comments were out of line , but they were not out of character for the @entity37 mayor			2
@entity55 is a co-founder of @entity57 , a national organization of 600 mayors who support stronger gun laws , and a frequent critic of the @entity62			2
still , the day after his remarks , @entity11 tried to head off a public relations headache by clarifying his statement			1
he insisted he " did n't literally mean " that police ought to go on strike and , in any case , he knew that it was against the law			1
that 's all well and good			0
yet there is one aspect of his statement from which @entity55 should not back away			0
he needs to stand behind the link he made between the safety of police officers and the ready availability of firearms			1
when you 're a police officer answering a domestic violence call , the last thing you want to find out is that someone in the house has a stockpile of weapons			1
and when you 're in a shootout , you should n't have to worry about being outgunned by the bad guys			0
welcome to the new front on the gun control debate			1
we should hear more from elected officials and the media about how dangerous police officers ' jobs have become thanks to loophole - ridden gun laws , a pop culture that glorifies gun violence and a powerful gun lobby that terrifies gutless politicians in both parties			1
we should also hear more from police officers themselves , whose associations usually talk more about protecting pensions than keeping their members safe from gun violence			1
i do n't believe that firearms are singularly responsible for mass shootings such as the one in @entity19			0
still , i 'd like to think that if someone purchases a semiautomatic ar - 15 rifle ; a 12 - gauge pump shotgun and a semiautomatic pistol ; 3,000 rounds of ammunition for the handgun and another 3,000 rounds for the semiautomatic rifle , law enforcement authorities might be aware of it before reading about it in the newspaper after a slaughter			0
but if we 're going to blame guns , we could just as easily blame dark movies and violent video games			0
years of exposure to that sort of thing undoubtedly desensitize young people -- and particularly young men -- to killing and violence by blurring the line between what is real and what is n't			2
it 's probably significant that the shooter chose as his venue the midnight showing of " @entity139 , " the latest installment in the @entity142 series			0
police say suspect @entity144 , who had been a @entity145 student at the @entity146 , had a @entity142 mask and poster in his apartment			0
he also colored his hair and , in conversations with police , referred to himself as " @entity153			0
" do n't buy that about movies ? now you know how gun enthusiasts feel			0
one of the frustrating things about this debate is that there is no consistency			0
people who object to generalizations and snap judgments about guns will accept them when they 're about pop culture , and vice versa			1
but this much we should be able to agree on			0
police officers should n't go on strike			1
but they should n't have to			0
they swear an oath to keep the public safe			0
the least we can do is return the favor			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180			2

mayor @entity11 said police officers should go on strike for better gun control
@entity180 : mayor was *wrong* about strike , but right about dangers police face
police face gun lobby , *cowardly* politicians , pop culture that glorifies violence , he says
elected officials and police unions should act to keep police safe , @entity180 says
