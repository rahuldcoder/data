@entity0 are generally excited about the new technology they expect to see in their lifetimes			1
but when confronted with some advances that already appear possible -- from skies filled with drones to meat made in a lab -- they get nervous			0
those are the findings in a report released thursday by the @entity11 , which sought to gauge public opinion about our rapidly changing world of science and tech. " the @entity0 public anticipates that the coming half - century will be a period of profound scientific change , as inventions that were once confined to the realm of science fiction come into common usage , " reads the report			1
overall , respondents to @entity11 's survey were upbeat about how technology will shape the near future			0
in the report , 59 % of @entity0 think tech developments will make life in the next half - century better , while only 30 % said they will make life worse			1
more than eight out of 10 respondents ( 81 % ) said they think that in the next 50 years , people who need transplants will be able to get them with organs grown in labs			1
and more than half ( 51 % ) think computers will be able to create art as skillfully as humans do			0
they 're a little less optimistic about some science - fiction staples , though			0
only 39 % think it 's likely scientists will have figured out how to teleport things ( or , presumably , people ) , 33 % say we 'll have long - term space colonies by 2064 and a mere 19 % expect humans will be able to control the weather			1
interestingly , some of the advances that may be closest to becoming reality are the ones survey respondents were most worried about			0
nearly two out of three @entity0 think it would make things worse if @entity0 airspace is opened up to personal drones			1
a similar number dislike the idea of robots being used to care for the sick and elderly , and of parents being able to alter the dna of their unborn children			0
meanwhile , only 37 % of respondents think it will be good if wearable devices or implants allow us to be digitally connected all the time			1
with the advent of @entity72 and other wearable technology , that may not be such a distant dream			0
and already , researchers are developing robots to provide elder care , 3d printers are replicating parts of the human body and government regulators are considering allowing nonmilitary drones to legally operate in @entity0 airspace			2
" in the long run , @entity0 are optimistic about the impact that scientific developments will have on their lives and the lives of their children -- but they definitely expect to encounter some bumps along the way , " said @entity84 , a senior researcher at @entity11 and the author of the report			2
" they are especially concerned about developments that have the potential to upend long - standing social norms around things like personal privacy , surveillance , and the nature of social relationships			0
" other responses shined a light on what may be our cautious human nature			0
while generally excited about future tech , many survey participants were n't so keen on testing out those advances themselves			2
people were split almost evenly ( 48 % -50 % ) on whether they would ride in a driverless car			0
but only 26 % said they 'd get a brain implant to improve their memory or intelligence , and a mere 20 % said they 'd try eating meat made in a lab. while they were imagining the future , @entity11 gave respondents the chance , in their own words , to share the one piece of futuristic technology they 'd most like to own			1
some 9 % said they 'd like to be able to time travel			1
a similar number said they 'd like something that would keep them healthy or extend their lives , 6 % said they wanted a flying car ( or bike ) , 3 % said they 'd take a teleportation device and a mere 1 % said they want their own jetpack			2
the report was based on telephone interviews conducted february13 - 18 with 1,001 adults from all 50 @entity0 states and the @entity144 .			2

survey : many @entity0 are wary of futuristic tech advancements
drones , robot *nurses* and always - on devices concern people
but 59 % still think tech developments will make future life better
nearly 1 in 10 say they 'd most like to be able to time travel
