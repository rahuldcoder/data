-- once again , the @entity2 family is complete			1
after six months in the hospital fighting for her life -- during which her parents fought to change national policy on organ donation to save their now 11 - year - old daughter 's life -- @entity2 returned home to @entity13 , @entity14 , on tuesday			1
" she just wanted to be with her brothers and sister , " her mother , @entity15 , told reporters			0
" i mean , she really just wants to be with her family			2
" then again , life has never been easy for young @entity2			1
she suffers from cystic fibrosis , a disease of the secretory glands that 's passed through genes -- even if the parents of the person afflicted do n't have it			1
according to the @entity31 , the disease often affects sufferers ' lungs , pancreas , intestines , liver , sinuses and sex organs			2
in mild cases , a person with cystic fibrosis may not be diagnosed until they are teens or , perhaps , adults			1
but for others , it can have a debilitating impact			0
that was the situation with @entity2 , who has been in and out of hospitals her entire life			1
speaking tuesday , @entity48 credited the diagnosis with making her daughter especially tough			0
" it 's a disease that 's really demanding -- ... it takes everything from the minute you 're diagnosed until you 're at the point where @entity2 is at , " the mother said			1
' she 's spent her whole life fighting			2
it 's just a different mentality than your average kid			0
" even then , the past year has been particularly difficult			0
@entity2 's lungs had deteriorated rapidly -- much faster than anyone in her family expected -- and in may doctors told the family that @entity2 had less than five weeks to live			1
despite her dire condition , though , @entity2 could n't get a lung transplant			1
she was the first candidate on the priority list for children in her region			0
but children 's organs rarely become available			0
in 2012 , there were just 10 transplants in @entity2 's age group , according to the @entity75			1
comparatively , there were more than 1,700 adult transplants in the same year			1
her family felt transplanting an adult lung was their best hope			1
but it was n't possible : @entity2 fell just shy of the requirement that anyone who gets adult lungs must be at least 12 years old			1
perhaps taking a cue from their daughter , the @entity85 fought vigorously to change that stipulation -- and like her , they succeeded			1
on june 5 , a federal judge issued a restraining order to prevent the @entity92 @entity91 from having the agency that oversees transplants apply the policy			1
@entity91 secretary @entity96 then directed the @entity75 to waive the rule			0
even after that move , the @entity2 family is vowing to keep working so youngsters get every medically sound opportunity available to get transplants			1
" kids on the system have died at three times the rate , " @entity48 said			0
" so we 're not letting go of it			0
" june happened to be a particularly tough month for the @entity2 family in many ways : not only were they initially waiting for a policy change , but @entity2 -- then 10 -- was clinging to life			1
their dreams appeared to come true that month as well , when she received transplanted lungs -- from an adult			1
but it did n't take , the family revealed later			0
for several days , a machine kept @entity2 alive			2
she got another chance in the form of a second lung transplant , which again came from an adult			2
speaking more than two months after that happened , @entity48 said " the lungs are doing fabulous			0
" " she 's weaned off the oxygen , " the mother said			0
" but she has the tracheotomy , ( which ) is helping her breath ... they just ca n't do it by themselves yet			0
" with her discharge and ambulance ride home from @entity136 , @entity2 is back where she belongs			2
but it 's not like things are all of a sudden easy for her			0
she still has trouble walking , relying on a walker to move			0
she will head off to rehab several times a weak			0
but @entity2 will also start school -- from home , initially -- the week of september 9			2
if all goes well , things will keep on progressing , says her father , @entity146 , who adds hat the goal is " getting more back to regular life			2
" each day , she gets stronger , " he said			2
" we 'll be doing more and more normal things			0
" given all that she 's gone through , for @entity152 , doing " normal things " will be an extraordinary accomplishment .			0

@entity2 has cystic fibrosis ; her condition and her lungs deteriorated rapidly
her parents fought to change a policy *barring* those under 12 from getting adult lungs
the family won in court , as @entity2 fought for her life ; she had two lung transplants in june
" each day , she gets stronger , " her father says
