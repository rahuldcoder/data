@entity0 -- ten @entity4 allegedly involved in intelligence gathering will be expelled from the @entity6 in short order , in exchange for @entity4 's release of four @entity4 prisoners accused of spying for the @entity6 , officials from both countries said thursday			1
the elaborately choreographed announcements emanating from both nation 's capitals described a case evocative of the @entity15			2
in @entity17 , attorney general @entity16 said none of the 10 had passed classified information and therefore none were charged with espionage			1
" they were acting as agents to a foreign power , " he told @entity22 , referring to the @entity4 who had been under observation by federal authorities for more than a decade			1
all of their children have been repatriated , he said			2
but @entity31 chief of staff @entity30 told @entity32 " that , although they did n't plead guilty to being spies , they " were clearly caught in the business of spying			1
" @entity37 , a lawyer representing two of the @entity4 , told @entity1 thursday night that all 10 were in a detention center in @entity0			1
they were to be taken to an airport in the city later thursday or friday , put on a plane provided by the @entity4 government , and flown directly to @entity45 , he said			1
in a conference call with reporters , senior administration officials said the 10 @entity4 agreed never to return to the @entity6 without permission from the @entity6 government			1
holding them would have conferred no security benefit to the nation , they said			2
this " clearly serves the interests of the @entity6 , " one official said			2
a second official said the four prisoners in @entity4 were in failing health , a consideration that prompted quick completion of the deal			1
under the plea agreements , the defendants disclosed their true identities in court and forfeited assets attributable to the criminal offenses , the @entity63 said in a news release			2
" the defendants known as ' @entity73 ' and ' @entity74 ' admitted they are @entity4 citizens named @entity75 and @entity76 and are agents of the @entity4 , " it said			1
" @entity79 ' @entity78 ' and ' @entity80 ' admitted they are @entity4 citizens named @entity81 and @entity82 , and are agents of the @entity4 ; " @entity79 ' @entity83 ' and ' @entity84 ' admitted they are @entity4 citizens named @entity85 and @entity86 , and are agents of the @entity4 ; " ' @entity87 ' admitted that he is a @entity4 citizen named @entity88 and is an agent of the @entity4 ; defendants @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93 , who operated in the @entity6 under their true names , admitted that they are agents of the @entity4 ; and @entity92 and @entity93 admitted they are @entity4 citizens , " the @entity63 said			1
authorities have lost track of an 11th suspect , who was detained in @entity98 , released on bail and then failed to check in with authorities as he had promised to do			0
in @entity45 , @entity4 president @entity103 signed a decree friday pardoning the four individuals imprisoned for alleged contact with @entity108 intelligence agencies , the @entity102 press service said , according to state - run @entity109			0
though the four @entity4 were released to the custody of the @entity6 , that does not necessarily mean they would go to the @entity6 , an embassy spokesman said			0
" three of the @entity4 prisoners were convicted of treason in the form of espionage on behalf of a foreign power and are serving lengthy prison terms , " the @entity63 said in a letter to @entity6 district judge @entity114			1
" the @entity4 prisoners have all served a number of years in prison and some are in poor health			0
the @entity4 government has agreed to release the @entity4 prisoners and their family members for resettlement			0
" it added , " some of the @entity4 prisoners worked for the @entity4 military , and / or for various @entity4 intelligence agencies			0
three of the @entity4 prisoners have been accused by @entity4 of contacting @entity108 intelligence agencies while they were working for the @entity4 ( or @entity136 ) government			0
" the individuals pardoned by @entity4 are @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141			0
all four appealed to the @entity4 president to free them after admitting their crimes against the @entity4 state , press secretary @entity142 said			0
the @entity4 @entity148 said the move was made " in the general context of improving @entity4 - @entity6 relations , and the new dynamic they have been given , in the spirit of basic agreements at the highest level between @entity45 and @entity17 on the strategic character of @entity4 - @entity6 partnership			0
" meanwhile , a lawyer for @entity141 , who was convicted in @entity4 in 2004 for spying for @entity6 intelligence services , said her client arrived thursday in @entity162 , @entity109 reported			1
@entity141 was convicted in 2004 of passing secret data to members of @entity6 intelligence services acting as employees of a @entity168 company called @entity169 , in exchange for monetary rewards in 1998 - 1999			0
but in @entity17 , @entity173 spokesman @entity172 denied thursday that @entity141 had been a spy			2
@entity1 's @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			0
