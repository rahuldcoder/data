-- a $ 10 million payout is not bad for four days ' work			1
that 's the potential prize on offer for one lucky golfer at the @entity7 course in @entity8 , @entity9 in the final leg of the @entity11			1
after three grueling back - to - back playoff events -- the @entity14 , the @entity15 and the @entity16 -- 125 starters have been whittled down to a select few			2
just 29 now remain -- 30th - ranked @entity17 is on a leave of absence -- going into thursday 's @entity19 , but only one can hit the jackpot			1
" retirement would happen a lot quicker if i win the @entity11 , " @entity21 champion @entity21 told the @entity23 's official website			1
@entity21 is one of just five men -- @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 are the others -- who are in control of their own destiny			2
that elite quintet have earned their stripes after earning enough points in the earlier stages of the @entity11 , as well as over the whole of the @entity40 season			1
due to the way the competition is structured , victory sunday for one of the five would secure them the $ 1.44 million @entity19 as well as the @entity11 , which brings with it that elusive $ 10 million jackpot , as @entity47 managed to do last year			1
that victory was made all the more sweeter for the @entity49 given that he 'd reportedly lost several million dollars in @entity51 's $ 7 billion @entity50 , which was uncovered in 2009			1
a slip - up in @entity53 , meanwhile , will not discount them from golf 's biggest prize completely , but they will be relying on their overall points tally for the season to ultimately prove superior to any of their rivals earning $ 3 million for a second - placed finish or $ 2 million for third would not be the @entity64 , either			1
" we 're trying to challenge ourselves , and this is what we have to play , this is what we have to do if we want to improve on the @entity11 or win a golf tournament , " @entity21 adds			1
" we have to play well			0
" the rest of the field , however , will be left sweating on the performances of others even if they become the latest name to be inscribed on the @entity77			0
while sixth - ranked @entity78 -- 1,100 points off leader @entity27 -- could well come out on top with a win or even a second - place finish , 29th - ranked @entity82 -- 2,280 points behind @entity27 -- would need something of a minor miracle			2
@entity87 , @entity27 and @entity28 go into thursday 's opening round with confidence off the back of their respective @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 wins			0
likewise @entity29 is still basking in his summer of success which brought with it the @entity93 and @entity94 , as well as the @entity95 , in the space of four weeks			0
the world @entity98 's best finish in the playoffs was a tie for fifth two weeks ago in @entity102			2
it has been a relentless summer , not just for the @entity104 , but for all involved in the world of golf -- 13 weeks have passed since the @entity107 began on june 12 , and in that time three majors , a @entity110 event and three of the four @entity11 playoffs have all come and gone			1
of the field in @entity8 , @entity113 has teed up the most often in that period , starting 11 times			0
this year 's @entity117 , starting on september 26 , has meant the @entity11 playoffs have had to take place back - to - back straight after the @entity94 -- a schedule the @entity123 tour 's commissioner @entity121 admits has been something of a mistake			1
" four in a row does n't really work , " @entity121 told the @entity23 's official website			0
" so we understand that			0
we did n't like it this year			0
we 're not going to do it going forward			0
" but @entity21 , who topped the @entity123 @entity117 qualification standings , professes to being unconcerned about the lack of a bye week in the playoffs schedule this year			2
" it 's just something that we have to deal with			0
think about it ; the money they are putting up , the money we are playing for , the retirement dollars , you make it work , " he told reporters			0
" you 'll figure out a way to show up on the tee			0

twenty - nine competitors will *battle* it out for the @entity11 this week
the @entity19 leg of the playoffs takes place at the @entity7
a prize fund of $ 10 million is on offer for the winner of the playoffs
the fourth and final tournament also offers its own $ 1.44 million prize
