editor 's note : @entity2 is an associate professor of international relations at @entity4 , directs the university 's @entity5 and @entity7 , and is a research fellow at the @entity9 at @entity10			1
she is the co-author , along with @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , of " @entity14 : lessons from @entity16 and @entity17			0
" @entity18 says the @entity19 recognizes the predominant power of the @entity21			1
( @entity22 ) -- as an @entity21 of @entity25 descent , i swelled with pride when i heard that the @entity27 selected president @entity28 to receive the @entity29			1
the award further validates what the 2008 presidential election demonstrated : the @entity21 is the most mature and fully functioning multi-ethnic democracy in the world			1
despite its emphasis on multilateralism , the @entity27 's statement also recognizes the predominant power of the @entity21			1
the accepted wisdom among diplomats is that the international system is multipolar because of the increasingly multilateral governance structure of the world 's numerous international institutions			1
in reality , however , the @entity21 is by far the single greatest economic , military and political power on earth			1
furthermore , many international institutions are dependent upon the @entity21 for their survival			2
announcing the award , the @entity27 said " multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position , with emphasis on the role that the @entity55 and other international institutions can play			0
" the @entity19 thus joins a chorus of international forums that contend that multilateralism is the hallmark of the international system			0
today there are more formal and informal international institutions than ever before , and they share a common theme			0
leaders attending the @entity66 summit in @entity67 , @entity68 , on september 24 - 25 declared that the @entity66 , a collection of advanced economies and fast - growing developing economies , would replace the @entity72 - 8 , the long - standing group of advanced economies , as the " premier forum for our international economic cooperation			0
" this decision is seen in no small measure as bowing to pressure from states such as @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 that have powerhouse economies but have been left out of key international economic meetings such as the @entity86 , which includes the @entity87 , the @entity21 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			2
the @entity66 leaders also agreed to increase the voting power of developing countries in the @entity97 by at least 3 percent and to shift the quota share in the @entity99 from developed countries to countries in economic transition by at least 5 percent			0
the @entity19 's sentiment was expressed at the @entity86 in @entity104 , @entity91 , in july when the @entity86 countries joined with the @entity106 ( @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity107 , and @entity108 ) , @entity109 and the @entity110 to declare : " our purpose is to foster a genuine partnership , in the context of a strengthened multilateralism			0
" that is similar to what @entity116 -- @entity81 , @entity93 , @entity83 , and @entity82 -- stated at its first summit on june 16 in @entity118 , @entity93 : " we underline our support for a more democratic and just multipolar world order based on the rule of international law , equality , mutual respect , cooperation , coordinated action and collective decision - making of all states			1
... we express our strong commitment to multilateral diplomacy with the @entity55 playing the central role in dealing with global challenges and threats			0
" the very next day , the members of the @entity136 ( @entity82 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity93 , @entity139 , and @entity140 ) put the matter more starkly as they concluded their summit : " the tendency towards true multipolarity is irreversible			0
" an increasing number of regional and international institutions with evolving memberships and leadership are multilateral			0
the world , however , is not multipolar			2
consider some important facts : the @entity21 has the largest gross domestic product defined in terms of purchasing power parity of any single state in the world ; it is surpassed in @entity155 only by the @entity110 , a collection of states ; and its gdp is twice that of @entity82 , its nearest competitor			1
the @entity21 accounts for approximately half of the world 's defense spending and it provides extended military deterrent cover for many of its allies , especially @entity166			1
whether it is the subject of positive or negative international public opinion , the @entity21 is a major source of cultural , political and social power in the world			1
in its recently released @entity172 , the @entity171 placed the @entity21 just behind top - ranked @entity173 , hardly a nation best positioned to lead the global economy			1
it is reasonable to expect that the @entity21 will soon regain the number - one position it held in earlier @entity171 competitiveness reports			2
international political , economic and military realities are not changed merely by declaring that they are something different from what they are			0
i believe the @entity19 knows this better than those writing communiqu√©s for the various international institutions			0
the @entity19 asserts that president @entity28 has " created a new climate in international politics			2
" in other words , it recognizes the @entity21 ' predominant global power -- power that does not appear to be diminishing and that is capable of shaping many of the multilateral institutions that depend on it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity18 : it 's become *fashionable* to talk of a " multipolar " world
she says @entity21 economy and defense forces still dominate the world
@entity2 : @entity28 's @entity207 recognized the *primacy* of the @entity21
