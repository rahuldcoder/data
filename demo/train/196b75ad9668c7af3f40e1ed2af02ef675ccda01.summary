the @entity0 is considering changing its longstanding policy against allowing openly gay members , according to a news release from the organization			1
the organization , which has 2.7 million members , is " potentially discussing " doing away with its national policy after months of protest , including hundreds of angry @entity8 renouncing their hard - earned awards and mailing back their red - white - and - blue medals			1
many parents of @entity8 across @entity13 found the national policy excluding gays confusing -- and at odds with basic scouting ideals			1
social media were abuzz with outrage over the policy ; gay men who used to be @entity8 spoke out in first - person blogs			1
on her tv talk show , @entity23 featured a @entity26 scout who had been denied his @entity8 rank because he is gay			1
members of the organization 's national board are expected to bring up the issue at a regularly scheduled biannual meeting in february			2
any change would be announced after that			0
scouting goes through a rough patch in the @entity8 ' statement monday , the group indicated that the national board may consider passing any decisions on gay membership to the local level			1
each troop 's charter organization would be able to decide " consistent with each organization 's mission , principles , or religious beliefs			0
" " the policy change under discussion would allow the religious , civic , or educational organizations that oversee and deliver @entity36 to determine how to address this issue , " the statement said			2
the statement itself is remarkable			0
some members will see the fact that @entity36 's national leadership is even discussing a policy change as a softening of its stance on gays and lesbians			2
but some @entity8 and @entity25 parents say that passing the decision to the local level will have little effect on the ground , because many troops have been ignoring the national policy anyway			1
the announcement comes after @entity36 's national headquarters received numerous complaints from a grass - roots campaign targeting the policy			2
in april , the @entity78 started calls for the @entity8 to end the ban			0
the group applauded monday 's announcement			0
" @entity0 have heard from scouts , corporations and millions of @entity13 that discriminating against gay scouts and @entity25 leaders is wrong , " @entity78 president @entity83 said			1
" scouting is a valuable institution , and this change will only strengthen its core principles of fairness and respect			0
" opinion : @entity0 , time to end discrimination the protest was sparked last year after @entity97 cub scout den leader @entity96 was forced to step down from her position in her son 's @entity25 pack because she is openly gay			1
the father of a gay @entity102 whose application for @entity8 rank was rejected by a @entity25 council hailed the @entity0 statement as " a step in the right direction			1
" " it 's interesting that the @entity0 is leaking this beforehand , " said @entity109 , whose son @entity110 was denied the @entity8 rank after being a scout for more than a decade			1
" we feel if they are going out with this much publicity they could n't possibly say no now , " said the elder @entity109 , adding that his son sees the move also as " a step in the right direction ... it 's about time			2
" meanwhile , conservative @entity122 president @entity121 released a statement in response to monday 's announcement saying the @entity8 organization " would be making a serious mistake to bow to the strong - arm tactics of @entity129 activists and open the organization to homosexuality			0
" @entity121 added : " what has changed in terms of the @entity0 ' concern for the well - being of the boys under their care ? or is this not about the well - being of the @entity8 , but the funding for the organization ? " some critics who say that scouts have failed to change with the times blame the connections to organized religion			2
approximately 70 % of scout troops are affiliated with some kind of church or religious group , according to @entity0 spokesman @entity151			0
@entity143 reports that 11 organization councils , which include more than 260,000 scouts , have publicly protested the policy , according to @entity78			0
the @entity155 and the @entity156 are among scouting 's biggest backers , @entity0 says			0

more than 200,000 scouts were members of units affiliated with the @entity155			0
