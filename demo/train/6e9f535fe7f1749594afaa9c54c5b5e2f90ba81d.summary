the ball is now in @entity2 ' court			1
less than one week after president @entity3 asked @entity2 for $ 3.7 billion to address the tens of thousands of immigrant children who have crossed the southern border in recent months , @entity2 is now tasked with doing something about it			1
it can pass it , do nothing or craft a new bill			0
it looks as if the latter approach is the most likely			0
the path to a solution , however , does n't appear easy			0
democrats and @entity17 are deeply divided on both the causes of the problem and the ways to solve it			1
republicans appeared on the political talk shows sunday with a mostly unified message , and their message contrasted starkly with the @entity16 ' position			1
republicans indicated that @entity3 's request , which includes $ 1.8 billion to care for the children in @entity31 custody , is not going to advance beyond their in - boxes			1
while they support the allocation of some money , numerous @entity17 said sunday that any money should be " targeted " to quickly deport the youths and to beef up border security			1
fast deportations " we should do targeted appropriations where it 's needed to make sure that we are able to detain people and send them back to their countries , " rep. @entity39 , @entity40 , chairman of the @entity41 , said on @entity43 's " @entity42			1
" his colleague , rep. @entity48 , @entity49 , chairman of the @entity50 , is a member of a group appointed by @entity54 speaker @entity53 to come up with border crisis solutions			2
he said funding should " provide more swift removal and return " to immigrants ' @entity59 countries			0
change the law ... a 2008 law that unanimously passed the @entity54 and @entity64 and signed into law by president @entity66 is prohibiting most of the unaccompanied children from being immediately sent back to their home countries			2
the @entity70 was written to protect young victims of human and sex trafficking			0
it states that minors must be humanely cared for , united with relatives living in the @entity31 if possible and given a day in court to present their need for asylum			1
" we think that law needs to be changed , " @entity48 said on " @entity80			0
" sen. @entity82 , @entity83 , who is considered a moderate voice on immigration and was a leading @entity17 to help pass comprehensive immigration reform through the @entity64 last year , said the children must be quickly sent home by the planeload			1
@entity82 : stopping child immigrant nightmare must include returning children , securing border " all we need to do is change the act , the @entity100 , to treat these children the same way as we do with @entity103 and especially @entity104 , " he said on @entity95 's " @entity94 , " noting that children crossing borders from @entity31 's two neighbors can be immediately turned away			1
... but do n't but as violence is pandemic in @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 , the countries from where most of the children are coming , democrats are reluctant to change the law , as some children are escaping violence and possible death			2
many democrats want to ensure that those who are facing life - threatening situations at home are given the opportunity to stay in the @entity31			0
" i will say this : follow the law , and the law said that we must put the children 's interests first , which is what president @entity3 is doing , " rep. @entity124 , @entity125 , said on @entity127 ' " @entity126			2
" rep. @entity135 , @entity136 , agreed			0
he said the children should be able to make their cases for asylum			2
" i think we 've got to be care when we consider completely doing away that that law			0
" but @entity48 hinted that he did n't support wiping out the law , just altering it			0
" those ( children ) with a fear of persecution and violence will have a legal basis to possibly stay , " he said			2
not much time while @entity48 said the border crisis " demands action " that should occur " soon , " time is slipping away			2
@entity2 ' monthlong august break is quickly approaching			2
@entity53 last week said he will wait until his self - appointed working group comes up with a proposal before the @entity54 moves forward			0
coming to agreement in a @entity2 where the @entity64 is controlled by @entity16 and the @entity54 by @entity17 is not usually a quick process			1
while 57,000 immigrant children have entered the @entity31 since october , another 30,000 are expected in the next 2Â½ months			1
secure the border the two sides are also sharply at odds over the issue of border security			1
@entity17 say too little money is in the president 's emergency request to protect the border			1
of the $ 3.7 billion request , $ 433 million would be for @entity167 , the agency in charge of border security			1
" the way to deal with it is to secure the border first , " rep. @entity170 , @entity171 , said on @entity95 's " @entity94			2
" @entity173 gov. @entity172 is leading the @entity17 charge for additional resources at the border			1
perry to @entity173 reps : do n't approve @entity3 's border proposal " if you have a patient who is bleeding profusely , the first thing you have to do is stop the bleeding , and that 's the reason we have been so adamant about securing the border , " @entity172 said on " @entity126			2
" he is calling on @entity3 to send 1,000 @entity186 troops to the border that could " show the force			0
" those troops would be temporary , until an additional 3,000 @entity190 agents would be permanently placed			1
" gov. @entity172 's just wrong , " is @entity124 's reaction			0
" the border is secure ; the fact is , the children are handing themselves over to the @entity190 agents			1
" @entity82 said the @entity31 needs to spend " about $ 6 billion " to secure the borders			0
since 2002 , spending on border security has more than doubled			1
the budget for @entity167 has ballooned from $ 5 billion to $ 12.4 billion in just over a decade , with steady increases each year , according to @entity203 budget documents			0
the number of @entity190 agents have also more than doubled			1
more than 18,611 agents patrolled the southern border in 2013 , which comes to about 9.7 agents per mile , according to @entity167			0
but on " @entity80 , " @entity172 insisted that more money needs to be spent			0
@entity3 needs to be " realistic about the problem and how you deal with the problem -- and it is a border security issue			1
" " you can keep throwing money and talk about enforcement , enforcement , enforcement , but you 've got to put money also into your judicial system , and you 've got to put money in a comprehensive program that deals with the issue , " @entity124 responded			0
rep. @entity224 , @entity225 , succinctly framed the dynamics of the current debate on @entity229 's " @entity228			0
" it " certainly appears most of the parties have gone to their mutual corners , " he said			0
" we 've got to get past that			0
" is the immigration crisis @entity172 's second act ? immigration statistics facts			0

@entity17 say more money should be " targeted " to quickly deport immigrant children
@entity16 say the youths *deserve* their day in court
republicans also say that *lax* border security is the problem
@entity16 point out that many children turn themselves in to the @entity190
