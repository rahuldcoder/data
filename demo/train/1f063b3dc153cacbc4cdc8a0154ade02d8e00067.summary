@entity0 , @entity1 -- while authorities do not yet know what killed @entity5 , the possibility that anesthetics -- particularly the drug diprivan -- might be involved continues to swell with each new revelation			1
@entity11 induces a coma , not sleep , an anesthesiologist told @entity2			1
on friday , the @entity14 quoted an unnamed law enforcement source saying investigators found @entity11 in @entity5 's @entity18 home			1
a nutritionist , @entity19 , said earlier in the week that @entity5 pleaded for the drug despite being told of its harmful effects			1
sources close to @entity5 told @entity2 's dr. @entity24 that the singer , who suffered from a sleep disorder , traveled with an anesthesiologist who would " take him down " at night and " bring him back up " during a world tour in the mid- 90s			1
the @entity1 state attorney general 's office has now said it is helping the @entity32 in @entity5 's death investigation			1
the @entity35 is also looking into the role of drugs , two federal law enforcement sources said			1
the drug @entity11 , known by its generic name @entity11 , is administered intravenously in operating rooms as a general anesthetic , the manufacturer @entity42 said friday			1
" it is neither indicated nor approved for use as a sleep aid , " said spokesman @entity43			2
the drug works as a depressant on one 's central nervous system			2
" it works on your brain , " said dr. @entity51 , the chair of the anesthesiology department at the @entity53			2
" it basically puts the entire brain to sleep			2
" however , once the infusion is stopped , the patient wakes up almost immediately			2
" so if you 're going to do this , you 'd have to have somebody right there giving you the medication and monitoring you continuously , " @entity51 said			2
dr. @entity67 , chairman of the @entity68 for the @entity69 , said he administers the drug during office procedures such as urology , dentistry and gynecology			2
it is also the most common anesthetic for colonoscopies , he said			0
both doctors said that while they have heard of the drug being abused by health care professionals , who have ready access to it , they had not heard of it being used as a sleep aid medication			0
" @entity11 induces coma , it does not induce sleep , " @entity51 said			1
" i can put you in a coma for as many days as you want			0
and , in fact , in intensive care units who have patients who are on a ventilator , that 's one of the drugs they use			0
" dr. @entity98 , of the anesthesiology department at the @entity100 , said the drug can lead to cardiac arrest without proper monitoring			2
" @entity11 slows down the heart rate and slows down the respiratory rate and slows down the vital functions of the body , " he said			1
not enough carbon dioxide exits the body ; not enough oxygen enters			0
and the situation can cause the heart to abruptly stop			0
" [ it is ] as dangerous as it comes , " @entity51 said			2
" you will die if you will give yourself , or if somebody will give you , @entity11 and you 're not in the proper medical hands			1
" @entity0 police have interviewed @entity5 's cardiologist , dr. @entity119 , who apparently tried to revive the singer after he was found unconscious on june 25			1
they also impounded @entity119 's car , saying it might contain evidence -- possibly prescription medications			0
police did not say whether they found anything			2
through his lawyers , @entity119 has released several statements saying that he would not be commenting until the toxicology results into @entity5 's death are released			1
the tests are due back in two to three weeks , the @entity132 coroner said thursday			2
" we are treating all unnamed sources as rumors			1
and , as we have stated before , we will not be responding to rumors or innuendo , " @entity119 's lawyer , @entity137 said friday			0
" we are awaiting the facts to come out and we will respond at that time			0
" the anesthesiologist who accompanied @entity5 during the @entity143 tour in the mid- ' 90s also refused to comment , although he acknowledged @entity5 suffered from a sleep disorder			1
" i 'm very upset			0
@entity5 was a good person			1
i ca n't talk about it right now , " dr. @entity145 said outside his @entity147 , @entity148 , home thursday			0
" it 's really something i do n't want to talk about right now			0
i lost a good friend			0
" on thursday , the @entity1 state attorney general 's office said it will assist @entity0 police in sifting through information in a state database that monitors controlled medication			0
the database , known as @entity159 ( @entity160 ) , contains an estimated 86 million records that list all doctors who prescribe such medication , the amount , the date and the person who receives it			0
authorities said the database was used in the investigation after the death of former model and reality tv show star @entity170			0
a day earlier , federal law enforcement sources said @entity35 agents would be looking at various doctors involved with @entity5 , their practices and their possible sources of medicine supply			1
a number of people close to @entity5 have expressed concern that medication could have contributed to the singer 's death at age 50			1
in 2005 , after he was cleared on charges of child molestation , @entity5 spent a week at a center run by dr. @entity188 , a physician who focuses on spirituality and the mind - body connection			1
during that week , @entity5 asked @entity188 for a prescription for a narcotic , the doctor said			1
" i said , ' what the heck do you want a narcotic prescription for ? ' " @entity188 said			0
" and it suddenly dawned on me that he was probably taking these and that he had probably a number of doctors who were giving him these prescriptions , so i confronted him with that			0
at first , he denied it			0
then , he said he was in a lot of pain			0
" @entity207 , a former attorney for the @entity5 family who was with the family in the hospital emergency room on june 25 , also expressed concern about medications the pop star was taking			1
" i talked to his family about it , i warned them -- i said that @entity5 is overmedicating and that i did not want to see this kind of a case develop , " @entity207 told @entity2 the next day			1
earlier this week , the nutritionist @entity220 , a registered nurse , said @entity5 suffered from severe bouts of insomnia and asked her to find him some @entity11			1
" i told him this medication is not safe , " @entity220 said			0
" he said , ' i just want to get some sleep			0
i just want to be able to be knocked out and go to sleep			0
' " @entity220 , however , said she did not know of any doctors who would have given @entity5 the drug nor had she seen him use it			2
@entity2 's @entity234 and @entity235 in @entity236 , @entity237 , and @entity238 in @entity0 , @entity1 , contributed to this report .			0
