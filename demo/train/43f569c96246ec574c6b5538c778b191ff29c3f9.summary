@entity0 -- it happens more often than you might think : streets cordoned off and bomb disposal experts called in to deal with unexploded bombs that were dropped on @entity7 nearly 70 years ago			1
commuters in @entity0 wednesday were the latest to suffer the inconvenience of dealing with ordnance dating back to @entity11 this time the culprit was a @entity14 - made aerial bomb weighing in at 100 kilograms ( 220 pounds ) , unearthed just two meters away from a train track leading into the city 's main train station			1
nearly 840 people were evacuated from the central @entity0 area , police said , before bomb disposal experts moved in to defuse the device			1
about 25 minutes after they started their delicate task , the mechanical fuse was unscrewed and the bomb was disabled			0
alert over , @entity27 could return home and go back to their everyday business			0
a member of the bomb disposal team told @entity1 the bomb could have blown a crater 3 to 4 meters wide and 3 meters ( 10 feet ) deep , had it gone off			1
the device was discovered by @entity35 , a lightly populated street with an industrial feel in the former " @entity38 " between @entity0 and @entity39			2
" they do risk a lot , but they have a lot of experience , " @entity0 police spokesman @entity40 told @entity1 as the bomb disposal team set to work			1
" here in @entity0 it is a fact of daily life to defuse bombs , but without question they are risking a lot			1
" wednesday 's operation was made more complicated because there was a depot for freight trains on one side of the site and houses on the other , @entity54 said			0
the device was found tuesday afternoon by a bomb disposal team that was checking out a construction site near the @entity66 , the central station			2
roads were closed in the area overnight as the experts assessed the best way to deal with the device			0
some train services were delayed wednesday , said @entity74 , spokesman for national railway operator @entity76 , but @entity0 's metro system , or @entity78 , was not affected			1
it may seem surprising that unexploded bombs remain undiscovered in @entity0 and other @entity7 cities decades after @entity11 ended			1
but so many were dropped by @entity83 forces during the war that finding them all will still take years			0
from the archives : @entity11 bombs defused , allowing 45,000 evacuated residents to return their presence is sufficiently common that private bomb disposal teams are contracted by @entity7 railway operator @entity76 and other companies to check that sites are safe when building works are planned			2
some bigger devices have been found elsewhere			0
a 250 - kilogram ( 550 - pound ) bomb discovered in central @entity96 last august had to be detonated where it lay because the fuse was unstable			1
the explosion damaged nearby buildings			0
in 2011 , 45,000 residents were evacuated from the city of @entity103 , situated on the @entity105 and @entity106 rivers , as bomb squads dealt with two bombs and a military fog - producing device that were dropped by @entity111 and @entity112 warplanes in the last years of the war			2
one was a 1.8 - metric ton @entity112 air bomb that could have wiped out the city center , according to the local fire brigade			0
they were exposed 65 years after being dropped when water levels in the @entity105 fell to record lows , prompting what officials said was the biggest evacuation since the war 's end			0
sometimes the bombs can have a more deadly impact			0
three members of a bomb - disposal squad were killed in 2010 when the device they were trying to defuse in the @entity7 town @entity130 went off			1
unexploded munitions a dangerous legacy of war @entity1 's @entity135 reported from @entity0 and @entity136 from @entity137 , while @entity138 wrote in @entity137 .			2
