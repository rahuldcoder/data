" that 's good news for @entity8 , a career expert and author of the in - stores - next - week " @entity9 : your guide to @entity12			1
" the media storm surrounding @entity2 , she says , is bringing to the forefront an issue that 's as relevant and pervasive as ever			1
" eight million @entity24 every year enter into at least one romance starting from work , " she said , quoting a statistic from @entity22 , an online career site			1
this number does n't tell the whole story , she added , estimating that 50 percent of workplace dalliances go unreported -- though they 're likely fodder for whispers and speculations			1
" the chemistry and energy of flirtation and sexuality , " whether people act on it or not , she said , " is a driver in the workplace			1
" @entity0 spoke to @entity8 about this touchy dynamic , the rules that can make this reality less dangerous and the questions she has about what 's happened in the " @entity43 " offices			2
here are excerpts from that interview : @entity0 : why should we assume workplace romances and flings are happening as often as ever ? have n't we moved away from that ? @entity8 : it is human nature			1
sex is on men 's brains ; we know this			2
... to think that -- during , in some cases , a 12 - hour day -- this is n't going to come up in the workplace is naiveté			1
@entity0 : if the goal of your new book is to help woman succeed professionally , should n't there be general rules when it comes to sex and the workplace ? @entity8 : at the end of the day , it is very dangerous to have sex with your boss			1
your reputation can be hit in a way that 's unrecoverable			0

what 's appropriate for one person , though , may not be appropriate for someone else			0
@entity0 : when it goes beyond flirtation and someone gets burned , do n't women more often than men pay the price ? @entity8 : the majority of managers are still , by and large , men			2

it 's hard to go up against a @entity2			1
even if [ a woman ] was legitimately taken advantage of , there are those who say , " did she call it sexual harassment for money 's sake ? " men are saying [ vis - a - vis the @entity2 issue ] , " so what ? " and women are saying , " did she really have a choice ? " @entity0 : given what we know so far about the @entity2 story , what is the biggest takeaway at this point ? @entity8 : there 's so much that 's left to be revealed			1
that no one 's complained -- he 's never had a complaint of sexual harassment -- is interesting			0
it either means we 're so much more evolved and no one cares or [ women have n't had ] the voice with which to complain			2
@entity0 : in cases where true love grows and ca n't be avoided in the workplace , how should a couple proceed ? @entity8 : companies are trying to institute love policies and love contracts -- guidelines on how to act			1
but that requires that they [ couples ] come forward			0

@entity0 : what other practical suggestions do you have for workplace couples ? @entity8 : you sit down and say , " what are our rules ? no necking in the lunchroom			2
we 're not going to have fights publicly			0
" the answer is n't do n't [ have the relationship ]			2
really , it is n't			2
it 's how to best manage it			0
@entity0 : given the tough economy and possible backlash , is n't flirting with a co-worker even more dangerous ? @entity8 : [ laughs ] yes , but i 've heard from women who are using that tactic to ensure they still have the job			1
maybe i need to start flirting with my boss , so he 'll keep me around ?			0
