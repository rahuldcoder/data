@entity0 -- a former @entity0 cop with military training vowed war against other men in blue thursday , leaving one officer dead days after he allegedly killed two other people to begin a wave of retribution for being fired , police said			1
the focus of the intensive , expansive manhunt is @entity13 , a 270 - pound former @entity14 lieutenant who has professed his venom against @entity17 officers he claimed ruined his life by forcing him out of his dream job			1
@entity13 blames one retired officer for bungling his appeal to get his job back in an 11 - page manifesto , in which he also complained of mistreatment by the @entity17			1
in that letter -- provided to @entity1 by an @entity17 source -- he vowed to violently target police officers and their families , whoever and wherever they are			1
" i will bring unconventional and asymmetrical warfare to those in @entity17 uniform whether on or off duty , " @entity13 wrote			1
" i never had the opportunity to have a family of my own , i 'm terminating yours			0
" authorities believe he followed through on his threats early thursday by shooting a @entity40 , @entity41 , police officer and two others			1
a day earlier , @entity44 police named @entity13 a suspect in the double slayings sunday of a woman -- identified by @entity0 police as the daughter of a retired @entity17 officer -- and her fiance			1
" my opinion of the suspect is unprintable , " said @entity40 police chief @entity52 , hours after one of his officers was killed			1
" the manifesto , i think , speaks for itself ( as ) evidence of a depraved and abandoned mind and heart			2
" the violence , as well as @entity13 's background as a police officer and military trained marksman , left police on edge around @entity41			1
in @entity70 , @entity17 officers guarding one of @entity13 's alleged targets mistakenly opened fire on a blue pickup truck that resembled one @entity13 was thought to be driving , said @entity0 police chief @entity73			1
the gunfire left two people wounded , @entity73 said			0
@entity70 police also fired on another blue pickup , but no one was injured in that incident , according to a senior law enforcement source			0
in downtown @entity0 , police wearing body armor patrolled outside their own iconic headquarters			0
police have good reason to be fearful , the chief said			0
" of course , he knows what he 's doing			0
we trained him , " @entity73 said			0
" he was also a member of the armed forces			0
it is extremely worrisome and scary , especially to the officers involved			0
" the manhunt for @entity13 spanned hundreds of miles and numerous counties			2
by thursday afternoon , it was largely centered around @entity97 -- about 100 miles east of @entity0 -- where authorities found the truck the suspect allegedly used in the @entity40 shooting			1
@entity102 : manhunt for former cop after officers shot police confirmed that the vehicle , which was burnt out when it was found , belonged to @entity13 by its vehicle identification number , @entity109 sheriff @entity108 said			1
this discovery spurred more officers to converge on the area to conduct beefed up patrols , staff checkpoints and go to every residence in the mountain community			0
@entity108 acknowledged the fire may have been set as a diversionary tactic , though law enforcement is n't taking any chances			0
early thursday evening , he said that aerial and @entity123 searches on the ground will " continue as long as we can " -- though snow is coming -- and urged locals to be on alert			1
" he could be anywhere at this point , and that 's why we 're searching door to door , " the sheriff said			0
1 cop dies in ' cowardly ambush ' it all started sunday when @entity13 allegedly killed two people in @entity44 , according to police			1
police identified the victims as @entity140 and her fiance @entity141			0
@entity142 , 27 , was the daughter of retired @entity0 police officer @entity142 , @entity17 officer @entity144 told @entity1			1
in his manifesto , @entity13 said @entity142 handled his appeal			1
on tuesday , @entity13 checked into the @entity147 on @entity149 's large naval base , @entity150			1
@entity13 likely had access to the hotel because he 'd been honorably discharged from the @entity154 , said the @entity14 spokesman			2
having retired february 1 as a lieutenant , @entity13 worked with mobile inshore undersea warfare units and provided security on oil platforms in @entity160 , according to @entity162 records			1
he was rated as a rifle marksman and pistol expert			0
" he did not physically check out " wednesday as expected , @entity151 told reporters			0
police in @entity149 say a man who could have been @entity13 tried to hijack a boat there on wednesday			1
someone later found a wallet containing @entity13 's identification and an @entity17 detective 's badge near the @entity149 airport , according to police			1
it was unclear whether the badge was legitimate			0
timeline in manhunt for former @entity0 cop by about 1 a.m. thursday , the scene had shifted about 100 miles north to @entity183 , @entity41			0
there , a pair of @entity17 officers on a protection detail were flagged down by a citizen who reported seeing the suspect 's vehicle , @entity17 deputy chief @entity184 said			1
the officers chased the vehicle and caught up to it on an @entity194 off - ramp			2
" the officers were fired upon with a shoulder weapon , " @entity184 said , with one of them suffering a " graze wound " to his head			0
the police returned fire , while the suspect set off once again			2
about 20 minutes later , two police officers were in their car at a stop light in @entity40 when @entity13 allegedly pulled up beside them			1
that driver unleashed " multiple rounds " from a rifle at the officers , riddling the cop car with bullets and leaving a 34 - year - old officer , who had been on the @entity40 force for 11 years , dead , according to @entity52			1
the other officer , 27 , was " seriously wounded but we expect a full recovery , " the @entity40 police chief said			2
@entity218 : @entity40 officer fatally shot it was " a cowardly ambush , " said @entity52 , claiming @entity13 has " no connection " to his city			1
a good @entity224 picked up one of their police radios and called dispatchers to send help , @entity40 police said			0
suspect calls attacks ' a necessary evil ' in addition to posting his manifesto online , @entity13 reached out directly to @entity1 , mailing a parcel to @entity237 anchor @entity236 's office at @entity1 in @entity238			1
the package arrived on february 1 and was opened by @entity236 's assistant			0
@entity241 was a hand - labeled dvd , accompanied by a yellow post-it note reading , in part , " i never lied " -- apparently in reference to his 2008 dismissal from the @entity17			1
the package also contained a coin wrapped in duct tape			0
the tape bears the hand - written inscription : " thanks , but no thanks , @entity254			0
" it also had letters that may be read as " @entity257 " , which could be a commonly used internet abbreviation for " @entity259 , " or possibly " 1 @entity260 , " which means one minute of angle , perhaps implying @entity13 was notably accurate with a firearm			2
the coin is a souvenir medallion from former @entity17 chief @entity265 , of a type often given out as keepsakes			2
this one , though , was shot through with bullet holes : three bullet holes to the center and another shot nicked off the top			0
the editorial staff of @entity237 and @entity1 management were made aware of the package thursday			0
upon learning of its existence , they alerted @entity254 and law enforcement			0
@entity254 headed the @entity17 at the time @entity13 was dismissed			1
the dispute centers on a 2007 incident in @entity283 involving a man 's arrest at a @entity287 hotel			0
two weeks later , @entity13 accused his training officer of kicking the man after he 'd given up			2
the investigators ' report said " the delay in reporting the alleged misconduct coupled with the witness ' statements irreparably destroy @entity13 's credibility			2
" the report cited contradictory accounts from the arrested man and his father and denials by the accused officer and three hotel employees that the arrested man had been kicked			0
@entity13 claims he was wrongly ousted for blowing the whistle on what he insists was police abuse			2
suspect 's grudge dates back to 2007 complaint @entity13 challenged his firing for years , losing at every turn			1
first , the police department 's @entity314 rejected his appeal			2
then , in october 2011 , a judge ruled against his appeal , according to court records			0
@entity73 , the @entity0 police chief , said thursday that @entity13 's case had been " thoroughly reviewed " and said the department would not apologize to @entity13 or clear his name			1
but as his manifesto shows , @entity13 is showing no sign of relenting			2
he complained he had been railroaded out of the department after reporting police brutality by another officer			2
@entity13 also complained of a continuing culture of racism and brutality in the @entity17			1
attacks on other police officers and their families , he said , are " a necessary evil that i do not enjoy but must partake and complete for substantial change to occur within the @entity17 and reclaim my name			1
" " look your wives / husbands and surviving children directly in the face and tell them the truth as to why your children are dead , " @entity13 wrote			2
such a chilling warning prompted @entity0 police to set up 40 protective details in an effort to safeguard people listed in @entity13 's letter , @entity73 said			1
the chief acknowledged that this effort was taxing the department , which has been placed under tactical alert , meaning all officers must stay on duty			0
" it 's extremely , extremely manpower intensive , " @entity73 said			0
" but the safety of my employees , people that come on the job to protect the lives of strangers , is extremely important to me			0
and i will expend whatever resource is necessary			0
