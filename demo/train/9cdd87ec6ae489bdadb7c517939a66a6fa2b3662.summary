-- assertive and bold , strong and courageous			1
these are the words we use when we think of our leaders -- the characteristics we look for when we elect politicians , vet ceos or select captains of sports teams			2
yet throughout history , these terms have been primarily applied when men have occupied leadership roles			2
we expect men to lead and assert themselves , and we encourage and reward these behaviors when young boys exhibit them			1
so why is it when a young girl exhibits these exact same characteristics , we often resort to a different word to describe her behavior ? a word that says to young girls : these are not the behaviors we expect from you			1
why do we call her " bossy " ? it seems like a little thing -- it 's just a word after all			2
plus , should n't we be teaching our children that words matter less than actions or deeds ? but words have power and meaning , especially during the critical early grade - school years , when boys and girls alike are developing their sense of self and finding their place in the world			2
according to the @entity50 2014 , more than a third of girls who are called " bossy " lose interest in leading and stop making decisions or suggestions			1
children begin to establish gender role stereotypes as early as 2 years old and generate an emerging career identity by middle school			0
as early as the third grade , girls report anxiety about taking leadership roles , become overly concerned about pleasing others and aspire to be perfect			1
by the time they reach middle school , the damage is done			0
a 2003 study by @entity65 notes that by the early teen years , more boys than girls report that they aspire to leadership roles in future careers , and millennial women are less likely to say they " aspire to a leadership role in whatever field i ultimately work			1
" whether intentional or not , the message is clear : society is both actively and passively discouraging girls from exhibiting leadership qualities , and that is translating to a generation of girls afraid to take the reins of leadership for fear of being disliked			1
and that is a loss for all of us			0
we can no longer afford to have half the population sidelined , their skills and their insight ignored , because of the messages they received as girls			2
that is why at @entity50 , we have teamed up with @entity98 's @entity97 and former @entity100 secretary of state @entity99 to launch our " @entity109 " campaign : a call for society to stop calling girls who exhibit leadership " bossy " and instead encourage and reward those behaviors the same way we would for boys			1
opinion : @entity97 wrong on bossy ban as the premier leadership organization for girls in the country , the @entity50 have been doing this for 102 years			1
we 've found that women 's leadership journeys begin as girls , and their future depends on receiving the same kind of encouragement and support boys receive when they demonstrate leadership capacities in life			1
i know how limiting words can be			0
as a young @entity128 growing up in small - town @entity129 , i watched as my mother tried to break the conventions of her time and place , running for the local school board when it was unheard of for a female , let alone a @entity128 female , to do so			0
i watched and listened as people , including family and friends , tried to discourage her from running			0
but i was fortunate , because i also saw my father support my mom and her ambitions			0
when he was told he had to make sure his wife knew her place , he responded that her place was to lead			0
words can hurt or heal ; they can shape our perceptions and either encourage our ambitions or limit our understanding of what we can become			0
when we refer to a girl who demonstrates leadership qualities as " bossy , " she receives a message she is doing something wrong , that somehow , the same behaviors we praise and reward in boys are inappropriate for her , and we are limiting the scope of her potential as a result			1
so the next time you have the urge to call a little girl " bossy , " stop , take a breath and say , " she 's a leader			0
" it 's time to redirect the power of words to girls themselves , so that " girl " and " leader " mean one and the same			0
it 's time to " @entity109			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2

@entity182 : leadership traits include being assertive , bold , strong and courageous
*author* : why is it young girls are called " bossy " when they exhibit these qualities ?
by communicating to girls that " bossy " is *bad* , it limits future leaders , @entity191 says
