@entity0 , @entity1 -- power lines crackled in the solid black night as the @entity4 rushed ashore			2
a sandy strip of a neighborhood called @entity0 was about to go underwater			2
" we 're gon na drown if this goes any higher ! " @entity10 remembers yelling to her four children			2
superstorm @entity12 hit a year ago this week , shocking this tiny community with its force			1
on one side of @entity0 , the ocean poured through homes and met @entity19 on the other side			0
the @entity22 ' home was right in the middle			1
but one glimmer of hope emerged from that dark and scary night : a hero was born			0
" i jumped into the water and went for help , " said @entity27 , 13 at the time			1
he swam like a little fish to the neighbors ' homes looking for people			0
his mother remembers how the little kids were screaming with fear			0
she pulled them atop a bed but the water was rising too high			0
@entity27 finally found someone on the second floor of a neighbor 's house			1
he swam back with them through the debris , he said , " not even thinking about what i was doing but just about my family			1
" everyone got out alive			0
they laughed later that he 'd made time to pull on his swim trunks			0
" it 's hard to explain how you feel about your son after that , " @entity10 said a year later			1
" i 'm so proud of him			0
even more after what he 's endured ever since			0
" @entity27 's exploits have become a footnote to his endurance , a high point at the beginning of his journey from heroism to heartache			1
in the days after @entity12 , he and his family evacuated to temporary housing an hour away in downtown @entity69			1
his storied community was a wreck			0
@entity0 has been home to @entity1 's rescue workers -- firefighters , police , military and medical -- for generations ; getaway neighborhoods of beach bungalows converted into permanent homes			1
it sits along the @entity81 , which juts into the @entity4 with majestic views of @entity84 's signature skyline			0
@entity85 , who combed its beaches here as a child , famously sang about " @entity89			0
" the sun is out , i want some it 's not hard , not far to reach we can hitch a ride to @entity89 in the days after @entity12 crashed ashore , the sun did seem out of reach			1
the historic community was awash with water from a bay , an ocean and even a massive sewage treatment plant that overflowed into @entity27 's school , @entity102			1
it was one of the worst hit among the 1,750 schools so badly damaged by @entity12 that the @entity1 school system -- the nation 's largest -- closed for several days for the first time in recent memory			1
immediately after the storm , @entity27 's house looked fine from the outside , though a boat had floated onto the adjacent lawn			1
but inside , a lifetime of memories were soaked with saltwater , the foundation was soggy and the walls were quickly crawling with mold			0
a family home rebuilt , then destroyed despite the damage , it was the @entity124 's lifelong home , so they began rebuilding at once			1
the family moved to a temporary apartment in @entity69 where @entity27 and his two brothers and sister would rise before dawn for a trip to the closest school bus stop , where private bus companies had been enlisted to fill in for the 300 lost in the storm			1
a half - hour later , the children were sitting in workrooms and auditoriums and even hallways , crammed into every available space in already crowded schools around the city that had welcomed 73,000 displaced kids			0
when school wrapped at 3 p.m. , they would make an hourlong commute to their wounded home , pulling out dirty wet clothes , useless appliances and furniture , and photo memories that would never be recovered			1
the @entity10 family was n't alone : more than half the @entity102 students had also lost homes , even the principal and many of the teachers			1
" it was heartbreaking to watch that kid and so many others , " said principal @entity155 , who also lost his home			1
" but they remained so resilient			0
" 7 years to build @entity102 , 15 minutes to destroy it " it 's just too much , " @entity27 said one day , breaking into tears at his desk in the temporary school			1
the teachers did their best to not miss a beat , but scattered friends and families , lost notebooks and lost books crippled the learning process for @entity27			1
he feared he might not keep up			0
then 2013 rolled around and @entity27 had " the best day ever " when the @entity172 reopened , with students wearing t - shirts emblazoned with the words , " @entity176			1
" with the ups came the downs			0
six months after @entity27 and his family started banging away at new wall supports and installing drywall in their wounded home , the city condemned the house and the menacing claws of a giant excavator chewed @entity27 's birthplace to pieces			1
" i would want to be here to see it but i did n't know it was going to be so tough , " said @entity27 , as machinery put an end to efforts to save their family home			1
@entity12 bringing down homes , families vow to be back as the family began the process of building a new home on their now vacant lot , the obstacles they faced were substantial			1
" the city required us to have two trees in place for a year before we could start unless we got an exemption			1
the new flood maps require us to build 10 feet over the sidewalk with at least a 5 foot foundation with flood vents , " @entity10 said			2
new flood maps issued by the @entity217 aimed to prepare for another big storm by stepping up building requirements in areas likely to flood			0
new homes had to be built higher and stronger and the @entity27 family was among those who did n't know where they would get the money			1
the @entity227 were among the @entity1 who applied for assistance from the federal " build it back " program			2
the federal government had allocated $ 648 million to the city for housing , but almost none of the money has reached the 24,000 people who registered for the program			0
this week , the federal government allocated another $ 650 million to the program and announced the first recipient			0
" they are taking such a long time and we are $ 100,000 short of money to rebuild , " said @entity10 , her voice cracking with frustration			2
" we 're going to put up whatever we can put up , rebuild whatever we can , grab money paycheck to paycheck , " she said			2
" we ca n't wait			0
we want to come home			2
" a new beginning plan a for the @entity227 is to buy an inexpensive modular home , which comes without a kitchen , flooring or appliances			2
" that is what we opted for since we would run out of money and we wanted to at least get a home rebuilt , " @entity10 explained			2
" it is those things along with front steps and back steps that we will have to still work on , along with the plumbing and electrical hookups			0
" she said the family has spent additional funds to meet the new building codes , including having a fire sprinkler system inside the house and other pricey extras that they did not expect when they filed with their insurance after the storm			1
" the house has to be @entity275 rated , which was an increase in the cost to rebuild as well -- all things not taken into consideration when the insurance company is paying out , " she said			1
they hit another hurdle this week , when the city rejected their architect 's plans			2
the family believes a few revisions will get them approval			2
they are living in rented housing paid for by an assistance program			0
@entity10 said she avoids visiting the spot where they used to live , an empty lot punctuated by a single mailbox			0
the children have only gone back once in many months , to pose for a picture for this article			0
" all that we can hope for is that a storm like this never comes this way again , " she said			0
" the only thing i 'm sure of is that me and the kids will never , never , ever be in this home again when a storm is on the way			2
" @entity27 , now 14 , expresses his frustration to his family daily , even as he brings home high grades and a perfect attendance record			1
he set up his own paper route and signed up 38 customers , insistent that he would help his family with money			2
" he wants his home back just like we all do , " @entity10 said			2
" i truly thought things would move quicker			0
there are days when we are just angry at the whole system and think something has just failed us			0
" then , just as she and her husband and children begin to fall into a state of dark despair , their glimmer of hope shines again			0
@entity27 was recently awarded a medal of honor from the @entity331 , something given rarely			1
it was to applaud him for risking his life to save others			2
they posted a video on @entity338 about his exploits			0
" the motto is ' be prepared , ' " said @entity27			1
" which really helps , because you never know what life is going to throw at you			0
" or what one teenage boy will throw back .			0
