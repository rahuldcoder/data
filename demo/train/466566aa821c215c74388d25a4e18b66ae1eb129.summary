in 2012 , her views made her the target of the @entity1 @entity3 , which tried to assassinate the then - 15 - year - old as she traveled home from school			1

after her meeting with @entity52 , @entity64 asked @entity0 if he had said whether any progress had been made in finding the girls			1

" let us not forget that one book , one pen , one child and one teacher can change the world			0
" in may , @entity0 told @entity64 's @entity138 that women were targeted by those who feared a society in which women are empowered			0
@entity0 's activism started after the @entity3 banned girls from schools in @entity1 's @entity146 in 2009			1
she anonymously blogged for the @entity147 in opposition to that order and became an open advocate for girls ' education			2
in 2011 , @entity0 told @entity64 , " i have the right of education			2
i have the right to play			0
i have the right to sing			0
i have the right to talk			0
