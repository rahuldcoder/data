remember when woolly mammoths roamed the planet ? no ? well do n't worry if you missed the last ice age -- scientists have moved one step closer to possibly bringing the beasts back to life with the discovery of liquid blood in a well - preserved mammoth carcass in @entity11			1
researchers from the @entity13 in @entity14 found the 10,000 - year - old female mammoth buried in ice on the @entity17 off the coast of northeast @entity19			2
scientists say they poked the frozen creature with a pick and dark liquid blood flowed out			1
" the fragments of muscle tissues , which we 've found out of the body , have a natural red color of fresh meat			0
the reason for such preservation is that the lower part of the body was underlying in pure ice , " said @entity29 , the head of the expedition and of the university 's @entity31 , in a statement on the university 's website			1
" the blood is very dark , it was found in ice cavities below the belly and when we broke these cavities with a poll pick , the blood came running out , " he said			2
" interestingly , the temperature at the time of excavation was -7 to @entity50			0
it may be assumed that the blood of mammoths had some cryoprotective properties			2
" ice age baby mammoth goes on display in @entity57 @entity58 is a substance found in modern fish and amphibians living in the @entity62 and @entity63 that minimizes the damage to the creatures ' tissue in freezing temperatures			0
@entity29 told @entity69 newspaper it was the first time mammoth blood had been discovered and called it " the best preserved mammoth in the history of paleontology			1
" " we suppose that the mammoth fell into water or got bogged down in a swamp , could not free herself and died			0
due to this fact the lower part of the body , including the lower jaw , and tongue tissue , was preserved very well , " he said			0
@entity29 called the liquid blood " priceless material " for the university 's joint project with @entity89 scientists who are hoping to clone a woolly mammoth , which has been extinct for thousands of years			1
the controversial @entity91 is headed up by @entity92 -- the disgraced former @entity93 scientist who claimed in 2004 that he had successfully cloned human embryonic stem cells before admitting he had faked his findings			0
@entity92 , who also cloned the world 's first puppy , was forced to admit he had fabricated the stem cell data and apologized in january 2006 after a panel of scientists found he had not derived human stem cells from eggs , as he claimed			0
a one - hour documentary about the joint @entity19 - @entity89 quest to clone a mammoth from the creature 's remains aired on the @entity107 in the @entity108 in april			1
@entity29 says the mammoth carcass has not been moved yet for fear of damaging it -- and that his team will join foreign researches in @entity11 for further research in july			1
