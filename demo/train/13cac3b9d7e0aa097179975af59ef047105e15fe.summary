-- with tuesday 's debut of @entity4 , a new social network , comparisons to @entity2 are inevitable , and immediate			1
@entity0 has yet to demo the service , which lets users gather and organize contacts through such @entity9 products as @entity10 and @entity11			2
but based on what @entity9 has posted about it online , here are some initial impressions			2
punch for punch , @entity4 reproduces some of @entity2 's most popular tools but adds one distinctive function : video chat			1
@entity9 refers to the video service as @entity21			1
several friends can join a room , and the live feeds from their webcams appear as separate blocks along the bottom of the window			0
the main video box shows the person who 's speaking the loudest at any given time			2
hangouts can also integrate with @entity9 's @entity33			2
by contrast , @entity2 has n't made video conferencing available on its website			2
but the social networking giant has a close relationship with @entity39 , which acquired @entity40 last month			0
recent versions of the @entity40 desktop software tie into @entity2 's services			0
with hangouts , @entity4 has at least one technological advantage over @entity2			1
but @entity9 's apparent ambition is not to unseat @entity2 right away			1
@entity9 has set up barriers to fast adoption , as it has done with some of its other products , by only allowing people who have been invited by friends to use @entity4			1
how tech bloggers are reacting to @entity4 when crafting a service to take on @entity2 , @entity9 was wise not to ignore what that popular network , with its more than 600 million users , already does well			1
@entity4 has photo sharing , which places a large emphasis on smartphone usage			0
for example , photos taken from an @entity62 phone can be automatically dumped into a private folder in the @entity4 web service , a la @entity67 's @entity66			0
the circles section in @entity4 is like @entity2 's friend lists			1
each user can organize friends into categories and limit which group sees which parts of his profile			0
with circles , users can more quickly send certain messages to a particular crew , such as siblings or frat buddies , that they would n't want to share with their entire list of contacts			0
a @entity4 group - messaging feature , similar to @entity2 's newer messages and @entity87 products , is called huddle			1
the +1 button , which was previously made available as an optional program for @entity9 account holders , ties this all together , not unlike @entity2 's " like " button			1
clicking +1 on @entity9 search results , embedded on other sites or from within @entity4 pages , allows you to share links with friends or selectively with groups of friends			1
unsurprisingly , @entity9 has tapped its prowess in web search for a section called @entity106			2
it 's like @entity108 , for receiving updates on favorite topics			0
@entity2 's search engine is @entity39 's @entity112 , but users of that site ca n't subscribe to updates in this way			0
the video conferencing ability may be @entity9 's sharpest edge over @entity2 's current product			1
however , video chat alone likely wo n't spark a mass exodus from @entity2			1
@entity9 appears to be rejecting the idea that @entity4 is meant to take @entity2 head on			1
@entity9 says its service is for more tight - knit groups , rather than for all types of online interactions			0
" the problem is that today 's online services turn friendship into fast food -- wrapping everyone in ' friend ' paper , " @entity9 executive @entity128 writes in a blog post			0
" we 'd like to bring the nuance and richness of real - life sharing to software			0
" @entity142 , @entity9 's executive chairman and former ceo , took a more directed swipe at @entity2 last month			1
at a technology conference , he described the service as catering to " every friend you 've ever had , including the ones you ca n't quite remember			0
" @entity9 suggests that it has plenty more to show			0
the company repeatedly refers to @entity4 as a " project , " indicating it will change over time			0
" this is just the beginning , " @entity9 said tuesday			2
" we 're just getting warmed up , and we 're already pretty excited about what 's coming next			0

@entity9 is beginning to roll out a new social network called @entity4
@entity4 packs many of the same features as @entity2 but adds video chat
the video chat feature puts the *spotlight* on whoever is talking the loudest
