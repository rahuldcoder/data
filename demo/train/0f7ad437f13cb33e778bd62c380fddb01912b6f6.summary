@entity0 -- a simmering dispute over islands in the @entity4 began to bite into trade between @entity6 and @entity7 on tuesday as @entity6 protests prompted @entity7 companies to suspend work there			1
the latest demonstrations included a protest by hundreds of @entity6 outside the @entity7 @entity13 in @entity14 on the 81st anniversary of an incident that led to the @entity7 invasion of @entity6 in 1931			1
flanked by a heavy police presence , the @entity6 demonstrators marching past the embassy were vocal but orderly , shouting that the disputed islands belong to @entity6			1
rowdy demonstrations also took place near @entity7 consulates in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , according to @entity1 affiliate @entity28			0
the protests appeared to be much more orderly than those that took place in many cities over the weekend , some of which turned violent			0
but they spurred some of @entity7 's biggest manufacturers -- @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 -- to halt production at some of their plants in @entity6			1
@entity43 reported monday that it would stop work at three @entity6 plants after two of them were damaged during saturday 's protests			2
@entity53 widens from island dispute between @entity6 , @entity7 @entity6 normally clamps down on public demonstrations , but has allowed the protests to go ahead			1
protesters carried banners that read " do n't forget the @entity62 , " according to photographs distributed by the state - run news agency @entity60			0
meanwhile , on the disputed islands , two @entity7 men carried out a small - scale protest of their own tuesday when they jumped from a fishing boat and swam to shore , spending a short amount of time on land , the @entity63 reported			1
@entity6 and @entity7 are the world 's second - and third - largest economies , and trade between the two @entity75 powerhouses amounted to about $ 300 billion in 2010 , according to the @entity77 - @entity76			1
but political ties between @entity0 and @entity14 have been strained over a cluster of islands that both countries claim , known as the @entity82 to the @entity7 and the @entity82 to the @entity6			1
they sit between @entity84 and @entity85 and have been under @entity7 control for more than a century , but @entity6 claims they have been a part of its territory " since ancient times			2
" @entity6 reasserted that claim last week , sending ships to patrol the area after the @entity7 government announced it would buy several of the islands from a @entity7 family			1
that move revived an issue left unsettled by a peace treaty between @entity6 and @entity7 in the 1970s , @entity97 , the administrator who led @entity98 after @entity6 regained possession of the onetime @entity101 colony in 1997 , told @entity1 's " @entity105			1
" when that treaty was hammered out , " there was one item on which they could not agree , so they agreed to disagree , " @entity97 said			0
" they shelved that argument but agreed there would be status quo , and there would be a joint effort to search for natural resources			0
" but @entity7 's decision " really inflamed public opinion in @entity6 , " he said			2
background : how remote rock split @entity6 , @entity7 the waters around the islands are a common fishing ground for @entity6 trawlers , with more than 1,000 of them working in the area every year , @entity6 says			1
and the ocean floor may hold as much as 100 billion barrels of oil , according to the @entity130 , as well abundant natural gas reserves that the @entity6 are already seeking to tap			0
@entity6 needs fuel to supply its rapid industrialization -- but @entity7 , which is almost entirely dependent on imports of oil and gas , is concerned it 'll be cut off from those resources			2
@entity6 termed the deal " illegal " and sent six surveillance vessels into @entity7 territorial waters on friday , drawing protests from the @entity7 government			1
a total of 11 @entity6 government ships were near the islands on tuesday afternoon , the @entity63 said , adding that it had warned the vessels not to enter @entity7 territorial waters			1
the dispute dates back to 1895 , when @entity7 captured the islands at the end of that year 's @entity151			2
in 1932 , it sold the islands to descendants of the original settlers			0
then the @entity77 occupied them from the end of @entity157 until 1972 , when it signed a treaty returning them to @entity7			0
" the @entity77 handed over the islands to @entity7 for its own purpose during the @entity164 , " @entity160 , the deputy director of the @entity161 , told @entity1			2
" so , personally , i think the @entity77 should take the blame for the dispute of @entity82 island			0
" @entity168 is @entity7 's leading military ally and @entity6 's leading trade partner , and defense secretary @entity171 has called on both sides to resolve the dispute peacefully during a visit to the region this week			2
" it 's in no country 's interest for this situation to escalate into conflict that would undermine peace and stability in this very important region , " @entity171 said after his meeting with gen. @entity177 , the @entity6 defense minister			0
for his part , @entity177 reiterated that the islands are part of " @entity6 's inherent territory			2
" " we reserve the right to take further actions , but we hope the issue will be properly resolved through peaceful ways and negotiations , " he said , according to the state - run news agency @entity60			0
@entity75 's disputed islands -- who claims what ? a public initiative begun in april this year by the outspoken governor of @entity0 , @entity202 , to raise money to acquire the islands for the city authorities set off a new cycle of tensions that included civilian protesters from both sides landing on the islands to stake their nations ' claims			1
@entity202 's move put pressure on the government of @entity7 prime minister @entity216 to step in with its own bid , which resulted in the controversial deal last week with the @entity220 family , the private owners up until that point			0
@entity7 's attempts to portray the purchase as a routine internal real - estate transaction , with the islands passing from one @entity7 owner to another , has failed to placate the @entity6 authorities			1
messages and photos posted on @entity6 social media sites showed angry mobs in numerous cities ransacking @entity7 stores and restaurants as well as smashing and burning cars of @entity7 make			1
the authorities rarely permit protests in @entity6 , prompting suspicion that the nationwide rallies over the weekend were government - sanctioned			0
in @entity14 , police walking alongside the demonstrators were seen to ask spectators to join in instead of blocking the street			0
but by saturday night , @entity6 's state - run media had started appealing for restraint , running commentaries that condemned violence and lectured the public on the expression of patriotism			0
@entity1 's @entity252 reported from @entity0 and @entity253 from @entity98			0
@entity1 's @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 in @entity14 contributed to this report .			0
