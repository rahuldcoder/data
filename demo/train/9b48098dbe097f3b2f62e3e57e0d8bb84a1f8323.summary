@entity0 , @entity1 -- a restaurant shut down by police last week for repeatedly violating @entity1 's tough new anti-smoking law will reopen next month smoke - free , the owner of the establishment said thursday			1
@entity8 , the owner of @entity9 , defiantly vowed a week ago that no one would close his business			1
but thursday he said he had decided to obey the law out of concern for his 16 employees and their families			0
" i have decided to accept the law , " @entity8 told reporters at a news conference at his restaurant , hours after regional health authorities said he had written to them , agreeing to adhere to the law that prohibits smoking in all indoor bars and restaurants			1
authorities said he still faces a nearly $ 200,000 fine for allowing smokers in his locale for nearly six weeks after the new law took effect january 2			1
@entity8 last week told @entity1 media he would never pay the fine , and health officials sent police on february 10 to close his restaurant , located near the popular southern @entity38 resort of @entity39			1
the closure of the restaurant was believed to be the first nationwide since the law went into effect , a @entity1 health ministry spokesman said last week			2
before the shutdown , @entity8 said , " i am using my constitutional rights as a citizen and i 'm not going to be run over by this dictatorial , @entity49 , terrorist government			0
" the twice - elected @entity51 government won backing for a law in 2006 that essentially allowed many bars and restaurants to choose if they would prohibit smoking			0
but as smoking continued across @entity1 , parliament followed up with the tougher one that banned such indoor smoking			0
the law puts @entity1 in line with the strictest @entity63 countries -- @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 -- which prohibit smoking in all enclosed public spaces			0
the @entity1 government says most of the nation 's 300,000 bars and restaurants are complying with the new law			0
many have added to their outdoor terrace space , or put in outdoor heating , so that clients can step outside for a smoke , where it is allowed			0
regional health inspectors visited @entity8 ' restaurant wednesday to confirm that large signs which previously stated " this law will not be applied in our establishment " had been replaced with others that say smoking is prohibited , a regional health service spokeswoman told @entity2			1
@entity8 , at his news conference on thursday , claimed he faced the potential fine because of the signs stating his disobedience to the law , and not for letting people smoke in his restaurant			2
he vowed to continue a signature - gathering campaign across @entity1 to rally support to overturn the law , which @entity1 's hotel and restaurant federation says has caused a loss of business for many establishments			2
@entity8 said his restaurant will reopen march 10			1
until then , he added , the staff will have a vacation .			0

@entity9 will reopen in march and comply with the smoking ban , owner says
@entity8 defiantly vowed last week no one would close his business
he still faces a hefty fine for breaking the law , authorities said
