-- they were the liars			0
" the bitter , vindictive and jealous			0

and he was very powerful and influential and did take them down , " @entity26 told @entity34 radio host @entity33 on tuesday			1

" he 's a chameleon			0
" other @entity4 critics also are likely to be watching the interview closely			1
@entity4 's former masseuse and personal assistant , @entity131 , told @entity0 last year that she went through " two and a half to three years of hell " after first speaking out about doping			1
" i got subpoenaed , i got ... kind of ostracized			0
and just the stress levels , " she said			0
" ... and all for telling the truth			0
as well as feeling feelings of guilt because i knew then that there were certain people now who would not speak to me again , and have never spoken to me again , and it 's a shame because i lost those friendships			0
" reports : @entity4 admits to @entity43 he cheated during cycling career former @entity4 teammate @entity146 also accused @entity4 and others in cycling of intimidating him into staying quiet about his own doping , which he finally admitted in 2011			1

@entity4 later sued over the book , including a libel lawsuit against @entity180 , which published excerpts			2
the @entity180 is now suing to recover the settlement it paid @entity4 in the case			2
how @entity4 will make money now " my feeling is that he came forward because he 's been in a pretty bad place since the truth has emerged , and the only way that he can rebuild to begin his life is to make a full confession of all the things he did , " @entity172 said			1
unlike some of the other critics , @entity172 said he did n't feel any vindication at @entity4 's expected about - face			1
