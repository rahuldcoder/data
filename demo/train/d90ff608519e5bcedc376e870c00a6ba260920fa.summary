@entity3 may need only a month to produce enough weapons - grade uranium for a nuclear bomb , a @entity2 - based anti-proliferation group says in a new assessment of @entity8 's enrichment program			1
but that is only if the country were able to take the most extreme and direct enrichment path , says the @entity12 in @entity13			0
under other scenarios , it would take significantly longer for @entity8 to produce the material -- more than 11 months in one estimate			1
and that would still not give @entity3 a nuclear bomb			1
turning enriched uranium into a usable weapon would take a great deal more time , the report suggests			2
the warning thursday from @entity12 was released as @entity2 lawmakers consider legislation that could tighten sanctions on @entity3 until a deal is reached on the @entity31 country 's nuclear program			1
it also comes after talks resumed on the program between @entity3 and six world powers -- the @entity2 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 -- known as the @entity41			1
the report examines scenarios under which @entity3 could produce enough weapons - grade uranium to make a nuclear bomb -- and " break out " of the @entity46			1
in a statement that described the report as " extremely alarming , " @entity48 majority leader @entity47 , @entity49 , urged the @entity2 to consider all options , including the use of military force , " to prevent @entity3 from acquiring the world 's most dangerous weapons			1
we all want negotiations to succeed , but time is clearly running out			0
" the report adds to the sense of urgency over the talks , said @entity64 , a research fellow at the @entity66 - based @entity65			1
but , he noted , not all analysts share the group 's view			0
he said it would be difficult for @entity3 to secretly work toward a bomb without kicking out international inspectors			2
@entity12 appears to have overestimated the pace of @entity3 's nuclear development in the past , however			2
in a december 2008 report , it said @entity3 was expected to reach a nuclear weapons capability " during 2009 under a wide variety of scenarios			1
" the @entity3 government declared the report baseless			1
" this is a huge lie because , according to @entity3 's supreme leader @entity84 , production , storage and use of weapons of mass destruction are haraam ( forbidden by @entity90 ) , " said @entity81 , a @entity82 spokeswoman			1
" @entity91 have no place in the @entity94 's doctrine			0
this kind of report is totally false			0
" @entity99 / @entity98 @entity97 important for negotiations according to @entity12 , the quickest route to a usable amount of weapons - grade uranium in the current circumstances could take @entity3 " as little as approximately 1.0 -- 1.6 months			1
" it said it updated its estimates based on the view that @entity3 has increased the number of centrifuges at its @entity110 and @entity111 plants and has begun installing a more advanced centrifuge model at @entity111			2
" the shortening breakout times have implications for any negotiation with @entity3 , " the report says			2
" an essential finding is that they are currently too short and shortening further , based on the current trend of centrifuge deployments			0
" the @entity2 government has said it believes @entity3 is about a year away from a nuclear weapon -- a more advanced stage than the one the @entity12 report is forecasting			1
@entity12 says that its estimates do n't factor in the time @entity3 would need to convert enriched uranium into weapons components and to build a nuclear missile			1
" this extra time could be substantial , particularly if @entity3 wanted to build a reliable warhead for a ballistic missile , " the report says			2
" however , these preparations would most likely be conducted at secret sites and would be difficult to detect			0
" @entity3 would face considerable hurdles to manufacturing a viable weapon without alerting @entity98 inspectors			0
the inspectors frequently visit @entity3 's declared nuclear stockpiles -- sometimes with less than two hours ' notice -- and check that @entity3 are not carrying out other enrichment activities or diverting nuclear material , @entity64 said			2
" so if @entity3 was trying to bust the rules , it would not in two hours be able to conceal what it had been doing , " he said			0
@entity3 officials optimistic after @entity146 talks painful sanctions @entity3 , whose economy is suffering severely under the @entity2 and @entity151 sanctions imposed because of its nuclear program , has long maintained that it is developing nuclear energy capabilities for peaceful purposes only			1
but amid a tentative thaw in relations between @entity8 and @entity13 since @entity3 president @entity159 took office in august , @entity156 prime minister @entity155 has urged the world community to be skeptical of @entity159 , calling him " a sheep in wolf 's clothing			1
" and members from both parties in the @entity167 have urged the @entity169 administration not to prematurely loosen any of the sanctions on @entity3 's economy			1
senior congressional staff members met thursday with @entity48 officials over @entity3			0
" @entity167 has been an important partner in our efforts thus far , " said @entity174 , a @entity175 spokeswoman			0
" we will continue our close consultation , as we have in the past , so that any congressional action is aligned with our negotiating strategy as we move forward			0
" @entity3 nuclear talks the next round of talks between @entity3 and the @entity41 is scheduled to take place next month in @entity146			1
a statement after the previous round , last week , described the talks as " substantive and forward - looking			0
" the tone of the negotiations appeared to signal a shift , a departure from the diplomatic standoff that prevailed under former @entity3 president @entity194			0
but details on the substance of the talks were scarce			0
@entity2 secretary of state @entity198 said this week that the @entity2 will not let up its pressure on @entity8 , despite the recent diplomatic overtures between the two countries			0
" we will pursue a diplomatic initiative with eyes wide open , aware it will be vital for @entity3 to live up to those standards other nations that have nuclear programs live up to as they prove those programs are indeed peaceful , " he said in @entity202 during a meeting wednesday with @entity155			2
" no deal is better than a bad deal , " @entity198 said , echoing comments from @entity155			0
" but if this can be solved satisfactorily , diplomatically , it is clearly better for everyone			0
" @entity155 , who has said @entity3 's nuclear program poses an existential threat to @entity156 , has listed a series of measures he says @entity8 needs to undertake , including a prohibition on centrifuges that can be used to enrich uranium to a weapons - grade level			1
tensions over @entity2 policy on @entity3 have emerged with another regional ally , @entity229			0
the @entity231 nation is wary of any rise in influence by the @entity235 theocracy of @entity3 across the @entity31 and has pushed behind the scenes for greater @entity2 involvement in @entity238 , whose president , @entity239 , is propped up by the regime in @entity8			0
are @entity243 sanctions against @entity3 to blame for playwright 's death ?			2

the @entity3 government says the report " is a huge lie "
the report says it could take @entity3 one to 11 months to make weapons - grade uranium
the estimate comes amid *renewed* nuclear talks between @entity3 and world powers
@entity167 is considering legislation that could tighten sanctions on @entity3
