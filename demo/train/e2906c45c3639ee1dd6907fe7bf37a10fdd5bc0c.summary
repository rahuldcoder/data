@entity0 will have to wait at least one more day to see how its new @entity2 spacecraft flies			1
the space agency scrubbed thursday morning 's test launch in @entity5 after a series of delays , the last of which happened because some liquid - oxygen fuel and drain valves failed to open during the countdown , @entity0 said			1
the launch tentatively has been rescheduled for 7:05 a.m. et friday			1
the launch of @entity2 -- a craft designed to eventually explore deep space -- is to be one of @entity0 's biggest moments since the shuttle era ended in 2011			1
@entity0 spent most of thursday morning 's nearly 2Â½ - hour launch window trying to work out various obstacles and kinks before scrubbing the launch around 9:40 a.m. et. the first delay involved a boat that came too close to the launch area ; more delays came because of wind gusts			1
when the countdown resumed , valves failed to open in the boosters , eventually leading to the scrubbing			0
a new beginning @entity0 hopes @entity2 will usher in a new era : eventual human exploration of deep space			1
" we have n't had this feeling in awhile , since the end of the shuttle program , " @entity33 , @entity2 flight director at @entity34 , said in a preflight briefing on wednesday			2
@entity2 looks like a throwback to the @entity43 era , but it is roomier and designed to go far beyond the moon : to an asteroid and eventually to @entity46			2
" it is , i think , consistent with those -- the beginning of shuttle and beginning of @entity43 , " said @entity48 , @entity2 program manager			2
" i think it 's in the same category			0
" when it becomes fully operational , @entity2 's crew module will be able to carry four people on a 21 - day mission into deep space or six astronauts for shorter missions			2
by comparison , the @entity43 crew modules held three astronauts and were in space for six to 12 days			0
@entity2 's crew module is 16.5 feet in diameter and @entity43 was 12.8 feet in diameter , @entity0 said			1
@entity2 is expected to take up its first crew in 2021			2
during this test flight , @entity2 will climb to an altitude of 3,600 miles ( 15 times higher than the @entity70 ) and will orbit @entity71 twice			1
four and half hours later , it will splash down in the @entity73 about 600 miles off the coast of @entity75			1
two @entity77 ships , the amphibious transport dock ship @entity79 and the @entity81 rescue and salvage ship @entity82 , will help @entity0 recover the capsule			0
@entity85 : @entity0 's @entity46 milestone once in orbit , @entity2 should send back some amazing pictures of @entity71 , @entity0 said			1
if the weather cooperates , @entity0 said a drone will provide a live video feed of the splashdown			0
though @entity2 's first flight wo n't have people on it , it wo n't go up empty			0
it will carry the names of more than a million people packed on a dime - sized microchip			0
" @entity105 " is sending up some mementos to inspire students about spaceflight , including @entity102 's cookie and @entity104 's rubber ducky			0
also going up : an oxygen hose from an @entity108 lunar spacesuit and a small sample of lunar soil			0
a tyrannosaurus rex fossil from the @entity112 will be on board and lockers will be filled with flags , coins , patches , poetry and music .			0

valve *problems* leads to scrubbing of @entity2 test launch
@entity0 now hopes to launch @entity2 on friday
@entity2 would orbit @entity71 twice and will splash down in the @entity73
