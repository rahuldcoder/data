@entity0 needed $ 950,000 from @entity1 in less than a month to make her dream of an affordable , free - to - play gaming console a reality			1
she got it in eight hours -- and nearly $ 8 million more after that			1
" it was the opposite of ' @entity13 , ' " said @entity9 , a gaming - industry veteran and former vice president at @entity11			2
" it was , if you come , we will build this			0
" and so was born @entity0 , a $ 99 console that 's shaped like and is just a hair bigger than a @entity20			1
it runs on @entity24 's @entity23 operating system and requires developers to offer a version of their games for free			1
@entity1 backers will be getting their @entity29 later this month and they 'll go on sale to everyone else in june			1
speaking here at the @entity34 festival , @entity9 said she got the idea for @entity0 ( pronounced @entity36 ) in response to a video - game industry that to her had grown stale			1
no new consoles were announced at last year 's @entity41 gaming conference by the big three console makers ( @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 )			1
in recent years , almost all the most hyped and popular games have been sequels			0
and the rise of mobile gaming has been limited , turning video gaming into a solitary exercise rather than the social one she remembered growing up			1
" the tv is the best screen for playing games , " @entity9 said in an interview - style keynote with editor @entity56 of tech blog @entity58			1
" i remember growing up , playing with my sister ... i feel like we 've lost that			0
i want to bring back the world of tv gaming			2
" for gamers , the strength of a console often boils down to the games they can play on it			2
to that end , @entity9 said 7,000 developers have signed up for @entity0 accounts , from big publishers who create multi-million - selling titles like " @entity77 " down to the smaller independents			2
the only requirement , she says , is that the game must be free or offer a free trial before the player has to buy it			0
how the game will make money -- whether it 's through ads , in - game purchases or sales after a free trial -- is up to the developer			2
" you should n't have to pay so much money to try out a new game , " she said			0
" we believe that every single game you should try before you buy			0
" during the hour - long interview , @entity56 pushed @entity9 on whether the @entity0 , which will have @entity99 of @entity100 and run on an @entity102 3 chip , will be powerful enough to run the kind of immersive , expansive shooters that have made big gaming releases as lucrative as blockbuster movies			1
her answer came in two parts			0
" yes , " she said			0
" and why would we ? " those experiences are great on those devices			0
you would n't want to play those games anywhere else			0
but we are going to have exclusive games			0
... we 're going to have inventive , creative , exciting content that no one else has			0
at $ 99 , it 's not an either - or decision			1
" @entity9 said some top developers will be reworking popular titles for the @entity0			2
others , some of whom have never made games before using @entity23 , are crafting new titles , she said			1
" we 're going to have our version of those games , but it 's going to be different , " she said			2
" we will have a first - person shooter ... game that you are going to want to play for hours on end			0
" @entity0 also has partnered with game - streaming site @entity135 , meaning that some graphic - intensive games could be playable on the device via the cloud			1
throughout its development , @entity0 has been open to its public , inviting them to help make suggestions			2
when backers pointed out on @entity146 that the color - coded buttons on the console 's controller were no good for color - blind players , @entity0 replaced them , making the four buttons correspond with the @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and a in its name			1
an ethernet port was added when some backers outside the @entity158 said they had no access to @entity160 , and a usb port was added for the " hardest of the hardcore " players who will want to store more games than the console can handle			1
increasingly , gaming consoles are becoming all - in - one entertainment hubs for the living room , and @entity0 will try to compete in that arena as well			1
the company already has partnerships with @entity172 and @entity173 and is in talks with major players like @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 and @entity24			2
" we 're pretty confident we 're going to have ( that content ) at launch or close to launch , " @entity9 said			0
between now and then , she 'll be focusing on two goals			0
" we want you to love it , " she said			0
" and we want it to work			0

@entity0 is a $ 99 gaming console that will require all games be offered for free
the console , which runs on @entity24 's @entity23 system , raised $ *8.6* million on @entity1
*founder* @entity0 says she wants gaming on tv to be social , fun again
@entity1 backers get @entity198 late this month ; it 's on sale to everyone in june
