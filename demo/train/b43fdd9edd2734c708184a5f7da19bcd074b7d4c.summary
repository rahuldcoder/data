-- there are times when political ambition spurs political leaders to reach new heights of courage and creativity			0
to date , the @entity9 outbreak of 2014 is not proving to be one of those times			1
by chance , the deadly infection first arrived on @entity15 shores in two states , @entity17 and @entity18 , where powerful governors are each nurturing dreams of the presidency and eager to posture as men with the right stuff to lead the nation			1
but @entity26 in @entity17 and @entity27 in @entity18 are both being tripped up by a dilemma that has bedeviled recent presidents : they are trying to govern an irritable , politically polarized electorate that demands and rewards certainty and bombast from its leaders , even in situations that cry out for flexibility and calm			1
forced to choose between narrow political advantage and the broader public good , @entity26 and @entity27 both showed they are willing to take the easy way out			1
from the very start , it 's been clear that the only logical way to stem the @entity9 crisis is to contain and control the disease at its source			2
that means getting medical materials and personnel to the @entity52 nations of @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 without delay -- battling the virus overseas so we do n't have to contend with it here			0
that 's a tricky , complex logistical task			0
even before the @entity9 outbreak , all three nations suffered from poverty , civil wars , rickety infrastructure and a weak health system			1
aid workers from @entity15 and other nations are frantically trying to build a public health system in places where none existed before ( in the hard - hit @entity75 region of @entity53 , for instance , there are only two doctors for 89,000 people )			2
the virus could conceivably overwhelm the heroic efforts under way			0
the @entity81 estimates that the three affected countries already have 10,000 confirmed , probable and suspected cases of @entity9 -- but that number could explode to as many as 10,000 new infections per week by the end of this year			2
in addition to causing a global humanitarian crisis , an epidemic of such proportions would be far more likely to spread to @entity91 and the @entity92 , which to date have treated only 18 @entity9 patients			2
the simple - minded reaction here has been to propose banning travel to and from the affected countries and quarantining anybody entering the @entity15 from those places			0
but that , according to health experts , would be a disastrous mistake			2
" we have been reiterating at every opportunity that we do not recommend travel and trade restrictions			0
we need outsiders to get in to combat this outbreak , " says @entity107 , a spokesman for @entity81			0
" we need expert logisticians , epidemiologists , communications experts			0
if the flights are being cut off they ca n't get in			0
" but the men who would be president are responding to very different considerations than the health experts are			2
" this is all hands on deck , " @entity26 declared at a press conference on october 1 , shortly after the news that a @entity53 man in @entity121 , @entity120 , had been diagnosed with @entity9			1
" professionals on every level of the chain of command know what to do to minimize any potential risk to the people of @entity17 , " @entity26 said , seeking to project an image of quasi-military efficiency that turned out to be a mirage			1
@entity120 's death was followed by the news that two nurses attending him also contracted the virus -- and had entered the dangerous , contagious phase of the disease while traveling outside of @entity17			2
reporters soon discovered holes in @entity26 's chain of command			2
at @entity146 , where @entity120 succumbed , a nurse said that boasts about training and preparedness were a myth : " we never talked about @entity9 , and we probably should have , " said one nurse , according to the @entity152			2
" they gave us an optional seminar to go to			0
just informational , not hands on			0
it was n't even suggested we go			0
... we were never told what to look for			0
" @entity26 ended up apologizing for his state 's shortcomings -- and , in a crucial concession to the politics of the situation , reversed an earlier position and called for creation of a no - fly list and suspension of travel to and from @entity9 - struck countries			1
in @entity18 , medical authorities handled the state 's first and only case of @entity9 more effectively than in @entity17 -- but that did n't stop @entity27 from doing a flip - flop of his own on the issue			1
about a week after a courageous physician named @entity177 returned from helping @entity9 victims in @entity179 , he developed an elevated temperature -- one sign that the virus may be present -- and was transported to @entity183 , one of the 11 city - run hospitals in @entity18			1
@entity27 , along with @entity18 mayor @entity187 , told @entity18 to be calm and staged photo ops of himself riding the subways -- something @entity27 almost never does -- to show the public that the chances of being infected with @entity9 through casual contact are slim to none			1
but the next day , @entity27 and his @entity196 counterpart , gov. @entity195 , announced without warning that any health workers arriving at @entity18 - area airports who had dealt with @entity9 victims will be held in quarantine for 21 days , the incubation period of the virus			1
the decision , made hastily , went into effect immediately			0
" since taking office , i have erred on the side of caution when it comes to the safety and protection of @entity18 , and the current situation regarding @entity9 will be no different , " @entity27 said			1
that was a 180 - degreee spin from october 7 , when the governor said he would oppose restrictions on travel			0
" i do n't think it works mechanically to say , ' shut off entry from any country , ' because what happens is you just fly to another country and you then you come in from that country , " he said back then			0
what changed in the meantime ? @entity27 , running for re-election on november 4 , has been hammered by his @entity227 opponent , @entity226 , on @entity18 's @entity9 preparedness			1
and the governor 's not - so - secret presidential hopes also depend on selling an image of forcefulness and strength to the nation -- an image that could suffer if he seems " soft " on border control			0
but the story did not end with this weekend 's stepped - up quarantine			0
sunday night , amid intense criticism from medical professionals -- including @entity241 , the nurse quarantined in @entity196 under that state 's rigorous new protocols -- @entity27 once again changed course			1
he backed down from the strict mandatory quarantine policy he 'd just instituted , according to an article in the @entity247 , and adopted a less severe one -- allowing home quarantine for those not showing symptoms of @entity9 and compensating them for lost income			1
make no mistake about it : forcing volunteers to sit in a quarantine center for three weeks -- @entity241 said she was confined to a makeshift tent and treated like a prisoner -- will discourage , and in some cases halt , the desire of good - hearted professionals to volunteer to fight the war against @entity9			1
@entity27 's hastily modified quarantine - at - home policy is less harsh , but could have a similar chilling effect			1
@entity195 continues to embrace the original , more severe quarantine			0
the great irony is that the politicians , driven by ambition , are going to contain , quarantine , hassle and discourage the people who really do have the right stuff : men and women willing to put their lives on the line to save the rest of us .			2

@entity279 : @entity17 , @entity281 governors took easy way out on @entity9 returnees
he says medical experts ' ability to fly in and out of @entity179 is key to stemming @entity9
he says @entity26 blustered about @entity17 ' ability on @entity9 , @entity27 played politics on quarantine
louis : effect will be to discourage *generous* health workers who are best hope
