-- it 's been a bad year for the @entity3 rhino , particularly for those that call @entity3 home			1
in 2013 , over 1,000 rhinos were poached in @entity3 alone			1
it 's a dangerously high number , when you consider there are only 5,000 black rhinos left on the continent ( a 97.6 % reduction since 1960 )			1
the white rhino story is a happier tale			1
rescued from the brink of extinction , the species now numbers 20,000 -- though conservationists worry they too are in danger , as rhino horn continues to sell for a hefty sum on the black market			1
" a rhino is killed every seven hours , and when you mention rhinos to anyone , they tend to shake their head in desperation , " says @entity25 , who , along with his wife @entity26 set up @entity27 , a charity that has recently come up with a novel approach to saving one of @entity3 's most iconic creatures			1
in 2015 , the charity will move 100 rhinos from @entity3 -- which holds 80 % of @entity3 's rhino population -- to @entity42 , which has the lowest poaching rate in the continent			1
the rhinos are mainly donated from private sellers and the @entity3 government			1
" it 's a bad idea to keep all your high - value assets in one place			0
ecologically and genetically , it makes a lot of sense to spread them around , so if there 's a catastrophic event in one place , you do n't lose everything , " he explains			0
@entity42 : ' shoot to kill ' one of the reason 's @entity42 's poaching levels are so low is that they have zero tolerance when it comes to poachers			1
@entity66 is handled by the @entity67 , who have a " shoot to kill " policy			0
" if poachers are apprehended , and do n't immediately put down their weapons , the military basically treats them like an aggressive military threat , " @entity25 notes			0
" the risks are very high for poachers , and the rewards are very low			0
" @entity42 is also more remote and less populous -- two factors that he says helps keep poaching at a minimum			1
" a group of foreigners walking through with @entity84 are very quickly identified , " he explains			0
making the move rhinos without @entity87 has partnered with tourism venture @entity88 , who moved rhinos from one of their private reserves to @entity42 in 2011			1
@entity96 candidates are sedated and their blood samples studied to make sure they 're strong enough to make the trip			0
the rhinos then recover during a six - week quarantine before they 're moved by plane to a secret location in @entity42			1
" they wo n't be going in reserves near the borders either , because the president and the @entity67 do n't want to attract poachers , " explains @entity104			0
because rhinos ' first instinct is to seek out other herds , and @entity42 has a low density of the species , synthesized rhino dung is used to help the relocated animals establish their territory			1
the process costs about $ 45,000 per rhino			1
busting the horn myth rhinos are killed almost exclusively for their horn , which currently sells for $ 65,000 per kilo ( 2.2 pounds )			2
the demand is driven primarily by buyers in @entity125 , who ( inaccurately ) ascribe various medicinal cure - alls to the horn			0
in addition to running their charity , the @entity129 are also filmmakers and photojournalists for @entity133			0
together , they have made several films dispelling the myths concerning rhino horn 's supposed medicinal properties , in the hopes of changing attitudes abroad			2
" it 's been claimed that rhino horn cures cancer , reduces fevers and is an aphrodisiac , and it 's been proven that none of those things are true , " says @entity26			2
" really , it 's like chewing your own finger nail			0
it 's keratin , that is all			0
" the ivory link the history of the rhino horn trade is closely intertwined with that of the ivory trade			2
in 1989 , the contention on @entity157 ( @entity158 ) succeeded in implementing an international ban on ivory			0
the price for the material crashed overnight and poaching of elephants mainly came to a halt			2
in 2002 , trade opened back up when a handful of nations , including @entity3 , were allowed to sell their ivory stockpiles			1
" the minute that happened , we saw an influx of poachers			0
at the same time , the market shifted straight across to include rhinos as well , " says @entity25			2
some conservationists have proposed farming elephants and rhinos to meet the global demand -- an idea the @entity129 view as hopelessly misguided			2
" if the strategy is to flood the market , the economics do n't add up , " he says			0
" maybe you could produce 6kg of horn a month from farming , but the market is over a billion strong			0

the black rhino population has *plummeted* 97.6 % since 1960
poaching is on the rise in @entity3 . over 1,000 rhinos were hunted last year
@entity196 without @entity87 is planning to populate @entity42 with rhinos
@entity42 has the lowest poaching level in @entity3
