@entity0 -- an @entity3 party that once supported @entity5 president @entity4 met wednesday with a prominent opposition group to talk about a solution to the political strife that has wracked the country in recent days			1
the ultraconservative @entity2 had backed @entity4 and the @entity10 , rallying support for the country 's new constitution and its emphasis on @entity16 law			1
but on wednesday , members of @entity2 met with the opposition @entity20 , a group composed primarily of @entity22 parties opposed to @entity4			1
the two sides are discussing a proposal by @entity2 to end the crisis			2
@entity5 has been embroiled in violence since last friday after a series of seemingly unrelated events last week			2
on wednesday , protesters faced off against police in downtown @entity0 , with police clad in riot gear chasing demonstrators into alleys			2
the latest anti-government furor stems from a limited state of emergency declared by @entity4 that imposes a 30 - day curfew on areas of violence , including the provinces of @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44 along the @entity45			1
but on tuesday , @entity4 appeared to back off from his orders , allowing local governments to decide whether to impose the curfew			1
critics have accused @entity4 , @entity5 's first democratically elected president , of hoarding power			1
in a speech this week , he acknowledged the legitimate dissent in @entity5 , saying " dialogue is the only way to bring about stability and security			0
" he invited representatives from 11 political parties to a meeting to try to solve the conflict			0
but @entity61 , head of the @entity62 and a member of the @entity20 , reiterated two demands before the front would engage in dialogue : the formation of a new government and a committee to amend the constitution			2
@entity4 on wednesday was in @entity71 , where he referred to the strife in his country during a joint news conference with @entity76 chancellor @entity75			1
the @entity5 president said he was working to establish constitutional institutions but vowed not to go beyond what he is empowered to do			2
" i do n't want to use any extraordinary measures in the transitional period , and i would not allow myself or anyone else to go against the law , " he said			1

" @entity5 will achieve a state of law and order that we all aspire to , " he said			0
" a civil state that is not run by the military , but its civilians with institutions , with democracy and also the transfer of democracy			0
a modern country in every sense			0

" it 's very difficult going from enclosed regime -- essentially one - man rule -- to a democracy that is trying to be born and learn to walk , " she told @entity1			0
the government must represent all of the people ; the rule of law must apply to everyone ; and the constitution must not marginalize any one group , she said			0
