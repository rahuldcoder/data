-- when @entity3 executive editor @entity2 told @entity0 in december that " something new " would come out of the recent death of the @entity6 's @entity5 , he was n't kidding			1
for starters , they wo n't even be using the name @entity6			1
on wednesday , @entity3 announced that the team is now going to be called the @entity11 , debuting in " @entity6 " no. 1 in march			1
gone are the traditional blue costumes			0
the team will now be wearing white - and - black costumes ( with three hexagons replacing the trademark number " 4 , " as well )			0
and then there 's the cherry on top : @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity25 " @entity20 will now be joined by the superstar of the @entity24 , none other than @entity27 ( also wearing a new white - and - black costume )			1
reaction to the news from comic book fans has run the gamut			1
here 's a sample : @entity27 joining " @entity6 " makes perfect sense ! " i think it 's a great idea , " said @entity35 of the @entity37 podcast			1
" the association between @entity27 and the @entity6 goes all the way back to ' @entity42 ' no. 1 in 1962			1
" one of the most memorable examples of this on - again , off - again partnership with the @entity6 involved a very different kind of costume change			1
in a 1984 issue of " @entity42 , " the webhead ended up putting on the iconic original @entity6 costume ... and they got around the problem of his mask by having him wear a brown paper bag on his head			1
@entity35 thinks that @entity27 joining the team makes sense on another level : " given that @entity5 ( @entity60 , the @entity5 ) has long been @entity61 as a superhero , it just feels right for him to step in and round out the roster to four			1
" comic book historian @entity64 agreed : " @entity27 is a scientist with a different perspective than mr. @entity21 , and he specializes in different fields , so it could be very interesting to see how his own expertise rounds out this new @entity11			2
and from another angle , it could be interesting to see how @entity27 feels about essentially replacing a person he considered a friend and what kind of pressure this will place on him			2
" on @entity78 , @ solidcolt put it this way : " ' @entity42 ' is possibly better then it 's ever been			0
and now he 's joining ( writer @entity5 ) @entity82 's @entity6 so that third movie is totally forgiven			1
" too much @entity27 ? " that 's enough @entity27 ! you are everywhere already ! " wrote @ kodok_biroe on @entity78			2
he might be the most recognizable character from @entity3 , and it 's not hard to imagine why @entity27 is so ubiquitous			2
he 's even a current member of the @entity89			0
there 's a lot of buzz around the new " @entity27 " film reboot starring @entity94			2
and then there 's that @entity97 musical that made so many headlines before it even officially opened			0
still , some fans might be left to wonder : why @entity27 ? why not a new character for the team ? " injecting @entity27 into the @entity6 will probably boost sales , but it feels like @entity3 is kind of pimping out the character and spreading him too thin , " @entity102 wrote at @entity103			1
" normally , the addition of @entity27 to a ' team ' comic might worry me a bit			1
@entity27 is -- along with @entity114 -- one of the most oversaturated characters in the @entity24 , " @entity112 's comic book guru @entity113 said			2
" but this new version of the @entity6 comes to us from @entity82 -- one of the most innovative voices working in comics today -- so i 'm actually really looking forward to it , white suits and all			2
and if you 've read @entity82 's other work , the new title and costumes seem to fit his science - based vision of the @entity6 perfectly			2
" yes , about those new costumes ... @entity6 's new costumes are true to its roots @entity37 podcaster @entity131 is a fan of the team 's new look : " the new costumes look great			1
" @entity64 , who often blogs about superhero fashion , looked at what makes the @entity6 special in his assessment of the costumes : " ( the @entity6 ) spend their spare time looking for other planets and dimensions to explore rather than patrolling for criminals to stop			2
so the new @entity6 suits work for me as a compromise between customized @entity147 flight suits and ' @entity149 ' uniforms			0
" white costumes ... really ? ( and what about @entity27 ? ) " i 'm not too thrilled about the move away from traditional blue , but i 'm sure ill get over it , " @entity35 said			0
" the new costumes are sleek , if not colorful			0
" and even though @entity64 liked the @entity6 costumes , he is not as thrilled about @entity27 's look			1
" it 's off - putting at first			0
@entity27 has such a unique costume design , with interesting line work and shape , and now most of that 's been removed			0
black and white works for the rest of the @entity6 , because it 's supposed to symbolize their stark look on reality following the @entity5 's death , but @entity27 's faced personal death and tragedy many times and has maintained a colorful sense of humor and the belief that eventually things will get better , " he said			1
" on the other hand , it would be boring to have him wear his classic costume and just add the hexagons to his shirt , so i can accept this as his @entity6 outfit that he wears when he 's representing their interests			0
if he were wearing this in his own comics as well , i 'd have a bigger problem with it			0
" is this really a permanent change ? as @entity64 noted not too long ago on @entity190 , the @entity6 have had a lot of costume changes over the years , though this one may be the most drastic			0
there have also been a number of changes with the @entity6 over the years , particularly the " @entity198 " storyline in the ' 90s			0
which begs the question , how long will these changes last ? " while i am sure i 'll continue to enjoy the title as it becomes ' @entity203 ' for the next year , i fully expect that a year from now , the big news around the title will be that it is reverting to @entity6 just in time for issue no. 600 , " speculated @entity131			1
" moreover , there is a strong possibility that issue will feature the heroic return of the @entity5			0
" permanent or not , it will be interesting to see whether these radical changes will ultimately be accepted			0
@entity2 promises a " unique , powerful new series that 's going to surprise a lot of fans with its combination of mind - blowing ideas and visuals			0
" if it lives up to that promise , you 'll be sure to hear exclamations of " @entity225 ! " from readers .			0
