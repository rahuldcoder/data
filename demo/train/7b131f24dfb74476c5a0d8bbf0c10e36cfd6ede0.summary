-- two billion dollars to buy the @entity1 ? ? ? come on , now			1
you might pay two billion to buy a @entity3 but not to buy @entity4			1
you might pay two billion to buy a yacht but not the @entity6			2
you might pay two billion to buy the @entity7 -- and somebody not long ago did -- but not to buy @entity11 's basketball - playing comedy club			1
would you ? uh , well , if your name is @entity13 , and you 've got money to burn , and the next goal on your bucket list is to own a basketball team , and you 're the kind of guy who loves this game so much that you 've even got " ball " in your surname , $ 2 billion is the price you 're prepared to pay , even if it means buying the worst franchise in the history of @entity26			1
@entity28 , are you sure about this ? you want to bounce these numbers off your banker ? two billion ... with a b ? yep , apparently the hoop - happy mr. @entity13 , who made much of his money by being one of the big brains at @entity38 , was in earnest when he told @entity40 , semi-estranged wife of the 100 % strange @entity41 , he would give her $ 2 billion for her @entity43 team , assuming it 's for sale			1
oh , and assuming it 's hers to sell			0
not so fast , says mr. @entity41 to mrs. @entity40 through his attorney , @entity48 , giving every indication that he intends to cling to his ownership of the @entity1 by any means necessary , even if it means filing a lawsuit against the @entity43 for a not - exactly - peanuts one billion dollars			1
disgraced , disgusted , dysfunctional ( delusional ? ) @entity41 is deadly serious			2
ok , so i said some bad stuff			0
ok , so my " girlfriend " got me on tape , blithering and blathering about black people and do i want her to bring them to my team 's basketball games and all ? ok , so i had to give up that nice @entity63 award they were going to give me , and that comedian @entity64 went on tv and said , " instead , they 're giving him the ' reason we still need an @entity70			1
' " @entity71 : the hypocrisy of @entity63 that does n't mean @entity74 , @entity75 , am giving up my clipper ship without a fight			0
ok , so @entity13 , the ex-ceo of that @entity38 computer business , is making a whopping offer of $ 2 billion for my basketball guys ? well , i may not know a laptop from a lap dance , but i do not intend to bail on my @entity1 just quite yet , @entity43 fans ! you ca n't miss me if i do n't go away ! a couple billion dollars for a basketball team might not be such a shocker if that team were , say , the @entity89 or the @entity90 , organizations with a long history of success , a loyal fan base and a general reputation for integrity and respectability			1
they are the @entity99 and @entity100 of this particular market , whereas the @entity1 are the @entity102 , the flops , the lemons , the clunkers that catch fire			2
number of @entity43 championships for the @entity1 ? zero			2
number of appearances in the @entity109 for the @entity1 ? zero			2
number of people you have met who said they want to see just one @entity114 championship before they die ? zero			0
oh , maybe @entity115 said something like that in his life , because ( a ) he is a comedian and a very funny guy , and ( b ) he happens to be one of the few people from @entity122 who has been true - blue to the @entity1 since practically the beginning , through one dog of a season after another , through thin and thin			2
700 sundays ? was that the name of @entity115 's hit @entity129 show ? well , this poor fellow has probably sat through 700 @entity131 , which makes him one of the most magnificent ( or most masochistic ) sports fans in history in my book			2
some of their season records since the @entity1 have been playing in @entity63 : 31 - 51 , 32 - 50 , 12 - 70 , 17 - 65 , 21 - 61 , 30 - 52 , 31 - 51 ... brief pause for a slightly better season or two , followed by : 27 - 55 , 17 - 65 , 29 - 53 , 36 - 46 , 17 - 75 , 9 - 41 , 15 - 67 ... you get the idea			2
it is true , amazingly , that the @entity1 of late have become a much better team			1
they have @entity145 and @entity146			0
they do not trip over their own shoelaces as often as before			0
but $ 2 billion worth ? no way			1
opinion : @entity150 is no @entity151 i used to go to @entity114 games once in a while , just to break the monotony of going to @entity89 games all the time and seeing how good basketball is played			0
i used to go to garden parties at @entity41 and @entity40 's home in @entity161 , where we would eat and drink and have a laugh about the @entity164 being behind this team forever because the @entity1 were about to get some newer , better players and become , you know , what 's that word they like to use about other teams ? oh , yeah : winners ! and did they win ? @entity173			1
i remember the season of 1994			0
the @entity1 lost their first 16 games			2
i mean , when your team 's record in the standings is 0 - 16 , you could make a case that any five tall people with tickets in the stands could beat you			1
@entity184 , one of the clip players at that time , said one day , " i have this picture in my head of a big headline screaming , ' worst team ever , ' and then they have a picture of our team underneath it , and we 're all sitting there smiling			0
" you would n't have given two hundred dollars for that team			0
@entity41 bought them in @entity198 for the nice 1982 price of $ 12 million and moved them to @entity201 , where they established themselves immediately as the slowest guns in the @entity205			1
i mean , some sports fans think of bad teams like the @entity208 as lovable losers , but the @entity1 were n't lovable , just laughable			0
they were regulars in @entity211 's and @entity213 's monologues			0
and still are , more because of their owner than their play on the court			0
@entity218 , another of the late - night tv comedians , said after word of @entity13 's $ 2 billion offer for the @entity1 got out , " @entity41 paid only $ 12 million to buy the @entity1			1
this deal is very uncomfortable for the former owner because it puts him in the black			0
" race - related jokes abound while racially insensitive remarks by the man himself got @entity41 in this fix in the first place			1
the @entity43 wants him to sell the team			0
his own players want him to sell the team			0
his own wife wants him to sell the team			0
just about everybody except @entity41 wants @entity41 to sell the team			1
this guy has all the popularity of a termite in a lumber camp			0
will he sell it ? will he give in and go away ? that remains to be seen , because what @entity41 says and @entity41 does are not the kinds of things ordinary people say and do			0
offering $ 2 billion for a middling sports team is also something a normal person does n't normally do			1
so , really , what would somebody like a @entity13 offer if , say , the @entity253 baseball team ever did come up for sale ? a trillion ? ok , a trillion - one , but not a penny more .			1

*ex-microsoft* ceo @entity13 offered $ 2 billion to buy the @entity1
@entity261 says it 's hard to imagine how the team could be worth that much
despite recent *uptick* in team 's *quality* , it has long history of *woeful* play , he says
@entity261 : owner @entity41 's racist remarks have further *tarnished* the franchise
