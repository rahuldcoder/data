as a journalist hailing from the @entity3 state of @entity4 , the epicenter of a violent @entity7 insurgency , @entity0 was regularly confronted with the shortcomings of his profession			1
the uprising , described by prime minister @entity11 in 2006 as @entity3 's " single biggest internal security challenge ever , " drew much of its strength from the disenfranchised indigenous communities who are a majority in @entity4			1
numbering perhaps as many as 100 million across @entity3 , the " tribals " live in impoverished rural conditions comparable to or lower than those prevalent in @entity19 , according to the @entity20			1
yet despite their centrality to the conflict , the voice of the tribal people was almost completely absent from the national media conversation			1
" there 's not a single tribal journalist , " said @entity0			1
" there 's a complete disconnect : reader , writer , ( media ) owners all on one side , this 100 million population on the other			2
the journalism is completely one - sided			2
" not only were the tribal people absent as voices in the media -- they had no access as consumers either , said @entity0			1
there were any number of barriers			0
they spoke different languages to those used in the mainstream press			0
many did not read or write			0
they lived in remote , inaccessible villages , without electricity			2
" to reach one village you typically need to cross five rivers and five hills -- and there are no roads , " said @entity0			2
" the only communication they have is with their wife or husband or people from neighboring villages if they go to market , because there is no radio , tv , magazines -- nothing in those languages			2
" @entity0 , a former @entity73 journalist , saw a link between the rural poor 's exclusion and the violence wracking the region			0
" it is natural when your concerns are not heard you find another avenue -- that avenue has happened to be a violent ideology called @entity85			0
" and so with support from the @entity88 , with whom he is a @entity89 , @entity0 began an experiment in citizen journalism			1
" we understood it would have to be cheap and that voice would be key -- because people are not comfortable with reading and writing , " he said			1
the initial phase of the experiment , which revolved around the internet and community radio stations , " failed completely , " he admitted			0
but then he took a different tack , focusing on mobile phones , which have a 74 % penetration rate in @entity3			1
" @entity105 is the most democratic tool in @entity3 today , " said @entity0			1
although the mobile penetration rate in rural areas was about half the national level ( 36 % ) , phones were still a common sight even in the most remote villages			1
" when we started working in 2004 - 5 in the villages , we did not see mobile phones			0
but there has been a sea - change			0
mobile phone use has exploded			1

the operation is simple : on dialing the service 's number , users press " 1 " to record a report , or " 2 " to listen to one			1
once a report is recorded , it is verified and edited by a team of moderators before being made accessible on the service			0
the service " did better than we ever expected , " said @entity0			0
he added that in the two years since it began , @entity142 has had 9,000 users , logged more than 30,000 phone calls and published 750 news stories , including a number which have had a big impact			0
for example , in january last year , @entity142 published a citizen journalist interview with @entity151 , a disabled man who said he had not been paid wages for 100 days of work on the government 's flagship rural job guarantee scheme			1
@entity151 's infant son had died as he could not afford to bring him to a hospital for treatment			0
national dailies picked up the story and a light was shone on what activists say is a common complaint of unpaid wages			0
@entity151 now contributes reports to the service himself			2
other stories have shared allegations including villages being razed in raids by security forces , police brutality , food programs for poor children going months without receiving supplies , and resistance to land being taken over for mining			0
" it is the first communication platform of any type for these people , " @entity0 said			0
" when they raise their concerns in their own language , some journalist or lawyer picks it up or authorities hear about it and solve their problem then the circle is completed			0
" the service has also played a role in preserving the tribal languages , he said			2

" @entity142 uses an innovative mobile phone system to help isolated communities for the first time have access to local news			1
and it provides an outlet that allows the people in these communities to be heard , hold governments accountable and create transparency			2
" @entity142 works because of the low cost and prevalence of the mobile phone , said @entity0 , and its success has seen it replicated in other parts of the world			1
in @entity225 , @entity224 provides a similar service in @entity227 , while an affiliated service , @entity229 , uses text messages to facilitate citizen reporting in @entity232 and @entity232			2
other projects modeled on @entity234 are being developed in @entity235 and @entity236			0
@entity0 is continuing to tinker with the model , with aspirations to overcome legal hurdles and incorporate a shortwave radio component into @entity121 's operations			1
for that reason , he said , @entity142 needs to be especially careful about the accuracy of its reports			0
" we are extra cautious not to give the authorities any reason to close us down , because we are the ones bringing out unpleasant stories for them , " @entity0 said			0
" there are people in power who would be very happy to shut us down			0
