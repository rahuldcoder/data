@entity0 -- in the end , the @entity2 did n't work			2
@entity4 , the multimillionaire who touted his business credentials as the @entity7 presidential hopeful , failed to convince voters that he was the man to unseat president @entity9 and jump - start the economy			1
" we have given our all to this campaign , " @entity4 told supporters in his concession speech			1
" i so wish that i had been able to fulfill your hopes to lead the country in a different direction , but the nation chose another leader , and so @entity22 and i join with you to earnestly pray for him and this great nation			2
" the result brought an end to @entity4 's longtime ambitions to become the nation 's commander - in - chief			1
he had come up short in the @entity7 primary in 2008 , but maintained his ambition and launched his 2012 candidacy on a farm in @entity33			2
opinion : @entity4 could n't overcome contradictions he stumped across the nation , focusing on key swing states such as @entity38 and @entity39 , selling himself as the ultimate alternative to @entity9 -- a man who understood how to fix the economy and who had worked across the aisle as governor in largely @entity47 @entity46			1
" @entity48 is a land of opportunity			2
but lately , for too many @entity48 , opportunity has not exactly come knocking , " @entity4 wrote in a recent opinion piece on @entity1			1
" we 've been mired in an economic slowdown that has left millions of our fellow citizens unemployed			2
the consequences in dreams shattered , lives disrupted , plans deferred , and hopes dimmed can be found all around us			2
" the son of a former @entity61 governor and auto executive , @entity4 has long been known among friends for his leadership skills			1
" this guy is impressive as far as executive ability goes , " @entity4 friend @entity65 wrote his mom in 1982			1
" i think he could be president of the @entity48			0
" reflecting on that note now , @entity65 said , " i was that impressed with his executive abilities and him as a leader			0
" @entity65 is a professor of mormon history and culture and the director of the religious studies program at @entity77			0
he served as one of two counselors to then - bishop @entity4 in the @entity80			1
portrayals of @entity4 as " being out of touch with the poor seem kind of silly to me , " @entity65 said			1
" i knew him on that level of real human stuff as opposed to the public image , " @entity65 said			1
" the man that i knew is not a caricature			2
he 's not a man without compassion for the poor			0
" but it is that image of @entity4 -- an out - of - touch rich guy who shipped jobs overseas as the head of @entity98 -- that stuck			1
during various stages along the way , @entity4 said " corporations are people " and that he " likes being able to fire people			1
" and that was long before his now infamous 47 % moocher line			0
@entity4 's @entity7 opponents in the primaries , and the @entity9 campaign and democrats after that , helped create that caricature , defining @entity4 to the electorate before @entity4 tried to show them who he was			1
at one point , senior @entity4 aide @entity115 said the fall campaign is " like @entity2			1
you can shake it up and we start all over again			0
" it was a comment that dogged the campaign and only served as political fodder of @entity4 as a flip - flopper , waffler and a candidate with no core values			1
@entity7 expands majority in governors ' mansions but even then , he won the @entity7 primary , although evangelicals initially were lukewarm to embrace a mormon who seemed disconnected with the @entity7 base			0
trailing @entity9 in polls through the summer , @entity4 did try to shake up the @entity2 picture he had created of himself as a " severely conservative " candidate , as he once described himself before a gathering of conservatives , tacking to the center in the last weeks of the campaign			1
but that might have only hurt him , contributing to the image of a politician with no firm convictions			2
the fallout late tuesday was almost immediate within the party			0
how could @entity9 have won in an electoral landslide when the economy is sluggish , the country is polarized and a sizable chunk of @entity48 believe the nation is on the wrong track ? " the takeaway is that a candidate can run for office with a lot of money , but when it takes him until march of 2012 to even get 25 % support within his own party , you 're running a weak nominee , " said @entity155 , @entity156 editor and @entity1 contributor			1
the tea party was quick to jump on the defeat			0
" what we got was a weak moderate candidate , hand - picked by the @entity176 elites and country - club establishment wing of the @entity7 , " said @entity170 , the national coordinator of @entity171			0
the strong language served as a salvo to the @entity7 and a sign of the potential civil war ahead within the party			0
@entity4 had emerged from the primary season as the best alternative after the @entity7 cycled through a series of hard - line conservatives			1
in doing so , the once - moderate @entity46 governor turned to the right , on abortion , health care and immigration			0
even within the @entity7 , many wondered what @entity4 's principles were : was he the pro-health care governor who supported abortion rights , or the @entity7 candidate who pledged to repeal @entity198 and spoke against abortion rights ? and why was he not touting his economic vision for the country more ? " you can make the case against @entity4 that he did n't sell those business credentials well enough , " said @entity202 , @entity1 's chief political analyst			1
" there will be some republicans who say it was n't us			0
" " there 's pretty common agreement , " @entity155 added , " that he really did n't run a campaign on the big ideas that he claims			2
he was rather guarded , even through the debates , on what exactly he was and was not going to do			0
the @entity9 campaign hounded him a lot on what his plan was			1
" the presidential election results are seen as a repudiation of the @entity7			2
most pundits predicted a bitter battle within the party on immigration -- that if the far right does n't change its intractable position , then the @entity7 is doomed down the road			0
@entity7 retains control of the @entity230 " the @entity7 needs to move forward , not sideways , " said @entity231 , a @entity7 strategist and @entity1 contributor			0
@entity231 , who was a @entity4 adviser in 2008 , compared this moment to the early 1990s for @entity47 , when @entity234 brought the party closer to the center			1
" they transformed their party			0
republicans are still seen as the party of not having enough solutions , " @entity231 said			0
" we 've got a failing , tanking economy going over the cliff -- and the opposition party was not seen as an alternative			0
" @entity1 senior political analyst @entity247 agreed , saying it 's imperative that the @entity7 transform itself			0
" it 's extremely unhealthy for the country to have a @entity7 that relies on whites for about 90 % of their national vote , " he said			0
@entity202 said president @entity253 was rebuffed by the @entity7 base when he pushed for immigration reform 10 years ago -- a stance she said haunted this election for @entity7			2
" when you look back on this election , when you look back to the primaries , when you look back to @entity4 moving to the right on immigration , " @entity202 said , " i think it was a huge opportunity that they missed			1
" there will be gnashing of teeth in the days , weeks and months ahead			0
what lies in store for the @entity7 remains a long way off			0
shortly before 1 a.m. wednesday , @entity4 walked onto a stage in @entity0 and told the crowd he had called @entity9 to congratulate him on the victory			1
" i pray that the president will be successful in guiding our nation , " he said			0
at the end , he walked from the podium to the middle of the stage and gave his wife , @entity22 , a kiss			2
running mate @entity281 and his wife , @entity283 , and @entity4 family members joined him			1
the crowd chanted , " @entity4 ! @entity4 ! @entity4 ! " he and @entity22 then walked hand - in - hand			1
the @entity287 exited stage right			0
five things we learned on @entity291 @entity1 's @entity292 reported from @entity0 and @entity293 reported and wrote from @entity294 .			0

@entity4 says he gave all to his campaign
he concedes election to @entity9
@entity4 had to fight an image of being out of touch
but a friend says the nominee was far from the caricature he was portrayed to be
