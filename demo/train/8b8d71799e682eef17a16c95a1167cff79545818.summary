@entity1 's presidential election season is underway			1
in a sign of genuine political progress , the government has begun accepting nominations for candidates to succeed president @entity7			2
this process started just weeks after the nation 's @entity9 passed legislation providing a legal framework for the presidential , provincial council and parliamentary elections			1
nothing is more important for @entity1 than building on the liberalizing achievements of the past decade and preventing a slide back toward repression			2
this is why it is crucial to retain and expand the hard - won rights of @entity1 women			1
gender equality is n't just a matter of moral fairness -- it 's essential to the country 's economic and political health and to ensuring that the nation has a secure , peaceful and stable future			1
since the fall of the @entity34 , @entity1 women 's rights have expanded significantly			1
the country 's current constitution affords equal protection to men and women , guaranteeing women the right to education , political participation and economic opportunity			1
@entity1 women are now employed at jobs ranging from doctor to police officer -- unthinkable under the @entity34			2
an @entity49 report found that school enrollment among girls has increased from roughly 5,000 to 2.4 million			0
but there is so much more progress to be made			0
@entity1 women are still the targets of institutional discrimination and gender - based violence			1
here in the last half of 2013 , two consecutive @entity60 chiefs were assassinated			0
in august , female parliamentarian @entity62 was kidnapped by @entity34 militants			0
a few days later , the vehicle envoy of female sen. @entity65 was ambushed , leading to the death of her 8 - year - old daughter			0
and in mid-september , @entity1 's top female police officer was shot as she left her home			2
@entity72 , head of the @entity73 of @entity1 , has noted that by targeting high - profile women , the @entity34 seeks to " limit the active presence and activities of women in their society			2
" indeed , a new @entity80 report finds that in the first six months of 2013 , the deaths of women and children jumped 38 compared to the same period last year			0
@entity85 forces will be drawn down next year			0
it 's absolutely imperative that their exit not bring on a backslide			0
the country 's government must be expected to keep its commitments to women and girls			1
gender equality is about affirming human dignity , and it starts with improving access to education			1
the statistics tell the story			0
mortality rates for children younger than 5 are 50 % lower for mothers who have attended primary school			0
educated women are less likely to die during childbirth and more likely to send their own children to school			0
these children then grow up to be the educated young citizens essential to sustained economic growth			1
these facts should n't be surprising			0
education is a basic human right and its impact is transformative in any society			0
educated women are major contributors to @entity1 's economy			1
each additional year of primary school improves a woman 's earning potential by 10 % to 20 %			0
women also provide an indispensable voice in political institutions			0
here in the @entity85 , after gaining the right to vote , women drew attention to underappreciated issues such as maternal health and child care , resulting in policy shifts that significantly reduced child mortality rates			2
given the enormous challenges that @entity1 faces , the country can not afford to regress back to a system in which some of its brightest minds are left out of the political process or any part of society			2
@entity1 's elections and the impending drawdown of @entity85 troops mark a new era in the country 's development			1
the international community must work to ensure that women 's gains in recent years are protected and that @entity1 women continue to make political and economic progress			1
any future support for the country 's government must be explicitly tied to continued defense of equal rights and continued progress of female citizens			1
for peace and prosperity , we must not abandon the women of @entity1 .			2

@entity163 , @entity164 : @entity1 vote must preserve gains by women
they say *post-taliban* women 's rights have grown , but recent violence has targeted them
they say gender equality and education for women is crucial to nation 's economic growth
*writers* : future support for country 's government must be tied to defense of equal rights
