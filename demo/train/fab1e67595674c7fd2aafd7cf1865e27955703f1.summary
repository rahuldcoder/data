-- the events on @entity3 's @entity2 that resulted in the death of five people and the injury of dozens more were tragic , but are they representative of a serious terrorist threat to the @entity12 state as is now being suggested by official sources ? according to @entity12 security organs , this act of driving a jeep into a crowd of people and setting it on fire was a " carefully planned , organized , and premeditated " terrorist attack carried out by a group of @entity23 extremists from @entity24			1
unfortunately , given the lack of transparency historically in the @entity12 state 's conviction of @entity30 on charges of political violence , we may never know whether this characterization of monday 's events is accurate			2
what we do know is that @entity12 security organs claim that the attackers in the truck , all of whom died , were a @entity23 man , his wife , and his mother			2
additionally , @entity12 state sources claim to have arrested an additional five suspects in connection with the alleged plot			0
were these alleged attackers members of a cell belonging to a large transnational @entity50 network like @entity51 ? are they representatives of a well - organized militant movement like @entity54 , which recently led an armed hostage - taking operation at a mall in @entity57 ? looking at the crude instruments allegedly used by these people -- gasoline , knives , iron rods , and an suv , it is difficult to argue that this was the work of any highly organized and well - armed militant group or terrorist network			1
there were no sophisticated explosives used in the attacks , and the alleged attackers did not even possess guns			0
furthermore , although @entity30 are @entity73 , there is no evidence that they have ever been involved substantively in a global @entity76 militant movement			1
so , how do we understand this act of violence if it was indeed carried out by a family of @entity30 ? the obvious answer is to look at what is happening in the @entity24 itself where such violent acts have been occurring with increasing frequency ever since the ethnic violence between @entity30 and @entity87 that spread throughout the regional capitol of @entity89 during the summer of 2009			0
life for @entity30 inside @entity24 is not like that of most people in the @entity12 ( @entity12 )			1
for the last decade , the @entity12 government has created a virtual police state within @entity24 , employing enhanced surveillance of @entity23 citizens , actively repressing @entity30 ' political voices , and greatly curtailing @entity23 religious practices			1
it has also vastly reduced @entity30 ' access to education in their own language and has limited uyghur language publications of original reading materials			0
officially , the @entity12 state explains most of these measures as part of its anti-terrorism measures to protect national security			0
these measures also regularly include arresting large numbers of @entity30 on charges of engaging in " illegal religious activity " or of having ties to terrorist organizations			0
in fact , during this month alone , security organs in @entity24 were involved in the fatal shooting of suspected @entity23 militants on several separate occasions and arrested at least one hundred more they suspected of trying to flee the country			2
although the government characterizes its ongoing and expansive confrontation with @entity30 in @entity24 as anti-terrorism , it is equally related to the @entity12 's larger plans for @entity24			1
the region is of critical strategic importance to the state as it is @entity12 's primary gateway to the west , both in accessing western markets for @entity12 goods and in securing natural resources , such as oil , gas , and uranium from @entity139 and locations further west and south			0
in this context , the @entity12 is presently funding enormous development projects in @entity24 that are also bringing a large influx of @entity87 migrants and are uprooting uyghur communities and displacing them from traditional lands			0
the state may not care to rid @entity24 of @entity30 , but it would like the @entity30 living there to willingly yield their perceived homeland to a @entity87 - dominant state culture			2
as a result , the future of the @entity24 appears destined to be neither @entity152 nor autonomous			0
with these events unfolding in the region that @entity30 view as their historical homeland , one feels compelled to question whether monday 's alleged attack was a well - prepared terrorist act or a hastily assembled cry of desperation from a people on the extreme margins of the @entity12 state 's monstrous development machine			1
however , given that this is allegedly the first instance that @entity30 have carried out such desperate acts outside @entity24 , and in this case in the very symbolic seat of central power , we may also be witnessing a sharp escalation in the @entity12 state 's confrontation with the @entity30			1
in the midst of this escalation , it is also possible that the @entity12 's long - maintained , but largely unsubstantiated , claims of a @entity23 terrorist threat are perhaps becoming a self - fulfilling prophecy			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180			0

@entity12 government has created a virtual police state within @entity24
crude instruments used in attack suggest not work of well - organized group
no evidence @entity30 involved substantively in a global @entity76 militant movement .
claims of a @entity23 terrorist threat maybe becoming a self - fulfilling prophecy .
