it 's safe to say @entity2 nailed it during his audition for " @entity5			1
" we already know the actor went on to become a superstar who immortalized the words " all right , all right , all right , " but thanks to the wonders of the @entity13 , we can watch the magic begin during his tryout for the film			0
a video of @entity2 's audition is making the rounds in honor of the @entity22 release of the 1993 @entity24 film			1
there 's the young actor looking majorly relaxed ( he is playing a stoner , after all ) and tossing off lines like " that 's what i love about high school girls , man			2
i keep getting older , but they stay the same age			0
" here are some other stars who also set out to wow casting directors with their takes on characters			0
@entity40 auditions for ' @entity41 ' @entity40 did n't snag the role of @entity43 ( that went to @entity44 ) in the epic film , but we suspect that director @entity47 saw something he liked in the then - lesser known performer , as @entity40 was cast as the young @entity50 in " @entity51 " @entity54 's ' @entity53 ' audition even as a little girl , @entity54 had star power and beauty			1
she makes going out for the role of @entity59 look effortless ( though the part eventually went to @entity61 )			0
@entity63 's ' snl ' audition " @entity66 " made him a star , and now he 's a big - time talk show host			2
but years ago , @entity67 used his celebrity impressions of stars like @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 to get his foot in the door			0
@entity78 's ' @entity77 ' audition @entity78 slayed when he tried out for the role of @entity80			2
you can hear the delight in the room when he sings " mr. @entity84			0
" @entity86 's ' precious ' audition this one is pretty deep			1
@entity86 shows off her acting chops as she reveals , in character , that she is hiv - positive			2
@entity93 's ' @entity92 ' audition it now seems incomprehensible that anyone but @entity93 could have played @entity96 in " @entity92 , " but who knows what would have happened had he not done as well in his 1977 audition			0
@entity100 audition for ' the notebook ' you 'll probably have a better reaction to @entity100 ' tryout for " @entity106			1
" the film made her a part of pop culture , but the actress cringed when " today 's " @entity112 surprised her with her audition tape .			1

@entity2 's audition tape shows the actor before he was a star
@entity40 , @entity54 , @entity86 among those with audition tapes *online*
@entity100 cringed at her audition for " @entity106 "
