there are 34 years of reasons to be skeptical about any negotiations that may emerge from friday 's historic phone call between president @entity4 and @entity6 president @entity5			1
there are scores of broken promises and outright lies about @entity6 's nuclear program itself			1
there is @entity6 's state sponsorship of terror and its efforts to extend its influence across the @entity17 at the expense of peace , human dignity and @entity22 's allies			1
but there are no reasons not to be appreciative of the significance of the call , the courage it took for president @entity4 to seek it , or the good common sense that is to be associated with the @entity22 talking to its enemies			2
earlier this week , a flurry of speculation surrounded a possible meeting between @entity4 and @entity5 on the edges of the @entity37 meeting in @entity38			1
during a session with @entity22 media that i attended , @entity5 said a handshake between the two leaders did not take place because the @entity6 did not want the gesture without a plan for following up on it			2
he said the @entity48 had proposed the meeting but @entity6 declined simply because there was not enough time to prepare such a plan , and added that he welcomed better communication with the @entity22			2
frankly , i was skeptical			0
but then , after two days of exchanges , the two countries hammered out a preliminary plan			0
with that in place , the historic exchange , the first by leaders of the two countries since 1979 , took place			0
both agreed to instruct representatives to begin negotiations toward an agreement regarding @entity6 's nuclear program			1
the @entity22 seeks to ensure the program does not lead to @entity6 's development of nuclear weapons			1
@entity6 , according to @entity5 , seeks to have the ability to pursue the peaceful use of nuclear power and nothing more			1
there have been negotiations in other forums in the past			0
@entity78 here and abroad have long asserted that @entity6 has been trying to move closer to the capability to develop nuclear weapons , despite years of passionate denials by its leaders			1
president @entity4 has said he would use whatever means necessary to stop @entity6 from acquiring nuclear weapons			1
@entity22 's closest ally in the region , @entity89 , has declared @entity6 's pursuit of such weapons an existential threat			1
@entity6 's neighbors in the @entity94 have watched its programs warily and offered telling indications that a nuclear @entity6 would trigger a nuclear arms race in the region			1
president @entity4 came into office citing this as a top national security concern			2
even as other @entity22 policy initiatives in the region have met with mixed success , he and his team stepped up a sanctions program that squeezed the @entity6 economy hard , contributing to a national economic crisis in that country			2
it was one of the things president @entity5 was elected to help fix			2
( of course , the choice of who could run in that election and what he could then do once in office was ultimately determined by that country 's ruling clerics , most notably , @entity122 ayatollah @entity121			0
) whether there was a benefit to be had from direct contact between @entity6 's president and @entity22 's was raised as early as the 2008 presidential campaign			1
strong voices in both @entity22 political parties counseled against such exchanges			0
@entity4 argued as president - elect that there was merit to more rather than less interaction , telling @entity136 's @entity135 in january 2009 , " we are going to have to take a new approach ( regarding @entity6 )			1
and i 've outlined my belief that engagement is the place to start			0
" since then , having overseen @entity22 's withdrawal from @entity142 , having set a date for withdrawal from @entity145 , and having appeared hesitant to aggressively engage in crises from @entity147 to @entity148 , @entity4 has found himself using " engagement " in a different , more defensive sense			1
critics , including myself , have argued he appears to be leaning away from the region and its myriad , complex problems			0
this week at the @entity156 he said , " the danger for the world is that the @entity22 , after a decade of war , rightly concerned about issues back home , and aware of the hostility that our engagement in the region has engendered throughout the @entity167 world , may disengage			0
i believe that would be a mistake			0
" now , it seems , at a time when the president has seen his foreign policy approval numbers hit new lows , he has reverted to his old idea of actively speaking to our enemies as the best way to prove he is not turning away from the region			0
he has collaborated with circumstances to choose this option in @entity148 -- and @entity6			0
both situations defy easy solution			0
the @entity6 have changed their tone but must go a long way to prove they are changing their intent , embracing transparency and adhering to international standards			0
even if they do , if they continue to support terrorist groups like @entity191 they will be at loggerheads with the @entity22			0
but as @entity195 said , " to jaw - jaw is always better than to war - war			1
" if talks come with the skepticism they deserve -- and a tough timeline that does n't let @entity6 use them as a stalling tactic to further develop weapons programs -- they are a risk well worth taking			2
and they may just demonstrate that the best adviser of the new @entity4 is the old @entity4 .			0

@entity207 : call with @entity6 's @entity5 historic , significant , and courageous for @entity4
he says fears that @entity6 has pursued nuclear weapons have led to *crippling* sanctions
he says in 2009 @entity4 said he wanted engagement with @entity6 , then appeared to lean away
@entity207 : @entity195 said " jaw - jaw " better than " war - war . " @entity4 seems ready to risk it
