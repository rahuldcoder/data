@entity0 , @entity1 -- sniffer dogs in @entity1 are being trained to help the fight against poachers of endangered species in a new way			1
dogs have long been used to help police find contraband substances , including ivory and rhino horn			1
however , there are times when it is not practical to use dogs on the ground , as the tarmac at border posts gets too hot for them during the day , or if there could be a danger to the animal			1
now researchers at the @entity1 company @entity24 are adapting their @entity25 to the fight against poachers			1
the technology involves using a vacuum device to suction air from a suspect area			2
the filter in the vacuum is then given to the dogs to smell , disguised among blank control filters , and the dog 's nose does the rest			2
@entity24 says this technology helps to get round all the problems that sniffer dogs traditionally face by " taking the odor to the dog rather than taking the dog to the odor			1
" @entity24 's @entity25 was first developed in the 1980s to detect landmines , weapons , ammunition and drugs			0
it has now been improved and adapted to detect illegal substances taken from protected species			0
dogs trained at @entity24 are now helping the police where conventional canine units are struggling			1
inspector @entity54 , of the @entity55 , said : " when we work at @entity58 for instance , the tarmac is so hot , it starts melting so you ca n't get a dog to work from 12 o'clock in the afternoon			0
" and the smugglers , they know about it , so then they know you ca n't bring a dog to the border posts because the dog of course will burn			1
" with this machine you take the samples , and give it to the dog in a controlled environment , an air - conditioned facility			0
it 's cool for the dog so the dog can work longer and more			0
" the stakes are high			0
poachers are smuggling rhino horn to the lucrative @entity83 market where it 's thought to have medicinal qualities and can fetch about $ 7,500 a kilo			1
conservation groups estimate that there are now only 18,000 rhinos in @entity1 today , down from 65,000 in the late 1970s			2
dr @entity90 , @entity24 's animal behaviorist and a former police officer , said : " we can search hundreds of cars and the dog will detect the odor that he was trained on			0
" so if the dog is trained on your protected species , or your narcotics , or your explosive detections , when your dog indicates we will know that you would then search for the specific contraband			0
" @entity105 said the dog would detect the substance , as long as it had been collected correctly in the vacuum sampler			0
@entity24 is working with the @entity1 police to research the feasibility of rolling the system out to all their canine units			1
@entity113 , colonel in the @entity55 , said : " i 'm very excited because it seems that we have a concept there that can work through all our points of entry in @entity1			2
it can assist all the dog handlers ; make their task a little bit easier for them as well			0

technology helps dogs sniff out ivory and rhino horn
it *avoids* practical problem of using dogs at border posts
@entity1 police are keen to roll it out to all their canine units
