@entity0 is a foreign affairs analyst who hosts " @entity1 " on @entity2 at 1 and 5 p.m. et sundays			1
@entity0 says @entity4 's elections could mark its debut as a great power			1
( @entity2 ) -- @entity4 prime minister @entity7 took the oath of office friday for a second consecutive term after winning a mandate for his @entity12			1
president @entity13 administered the oath to @entity7 , seen as the architect of @entity4 's economic reforms in the 1990s			1
nineteen other lawmakers also were sworn in as members of the new federal @entity19			0
the @entity12 , headed by @entity21 - born @entity20 , won 206 of 543 boroughs in the april and may general elections			0
that is the party 's best performance in almost two decades that saw mostly coalition governments running the country			1
@entity2 spoke to author and foreign affairs analyst @entity0 about the results			1
@entity2 : what do you think of the outcome of the @entity4 elections ? @entity0 : these elections i think may be looked upon as @entity4 's debut as a great power -- the way the opening ceremonies of the @entity41 heralded @entity43 's debut			1
they are also the perfect symbol , in this case , of @entity4 's unique strengths -- which are defined not by government power but people power with all the messiness and chaos that implies			1
with 420 million people voting , @entity4 's recent polling was the biggest exercise of democracy ever			1
@entity2 : but the exercise of democracy in @entity4 is n't new			1
what makes this one special ? @entity0 : you are right			1
it was the result of these elections			0
over the last two decades , @entity4 has been consumed with its internal divisions -- of caste , ethnicity and religion			1
this has made if difficult for a government in @entity69 to mobilize national power to any purposeful and responsible end internationally			2
a decentralized , divided , and diffuse polity has punched well below its weight internationally or adopted policies abroad for purely domestic reasons			0
that 's bad for @entity4 and bad for the world			1
this could all change , starting with this election result			2
for the first time in three decades , a single party -- the @entity12 -- was given a clear and large mandate			1
@entity2 : why were there so many problems in the past ? @entity0 : it was mainly two issues			2
first , populism trumps economic reform			0
promising the voters goodies works better than imposing budgetary discipline			2
two , in the age of terrorism , fear was an easy way to mobilize political support			0
( these problems have affected democracies in rich countries like @entity101 just as much as poor ones			0
) the @entity4 results contradict both notions			2
the @entity12 has been reasonably reform - mined economically and highly responsible on issues of terrorism			0
it chose not to react violently to the recent @entity109 terror attacks and was vilified as weak by the opposition			0
the voters did n't buy it			0
@entity2 : can you think of why things have changed for the voters ? @entity0 : i ca n't be certain but i will put some of the credit for providing a new option to voters on the shoulder of @entity121			1
he is the 39 - year - old son of the former prime minister of india , @entity122 , and the current head of the @entity12 , @entity20			0
he spent the last few years reviving the grassroots base of the @entity12			0
he also made a series of big strategic bets during the campaign such as to field young candidates , not to ally with caste - based parties which proved to be right			0
he , along with his mother and the current prime minister @entity7 , are reviving the @entity12 , and have done all this while maintaining a commitment to secularism , economic reform and clean government @entity2 : so the voters in @entity4 got it right ? @entity0 : i think so			1
but i also do want to take a minute to impress on readers the scope of elections in @entity4			2
it really is amazing to see the largest democracy at work			0
first of all , look at the scope			0
that 's more than all the people ( men , women and children ) who live in the @entity101 , @entity151 and @entity152 combined			2
then the process -- there are five election days over the course of a month ; votes are cast in almost 1 million polling places			2
it is by far the biggest exercise in democracy in the history of the world			1
but all of that is only part of what makes it really remarkable			0
the @entity4 electorate is one of the poorest , least educated in the world but they actively participate in the political process			2
and they voted in a very intelligent way			0
something they should be very proud of .			0

@entity0 : election shows @entity4 's unique strength , people power
420 million voters make this biggest democracy exercise ever , he says
@entity0 : for the first time in three decades , one party has a clear mandate
