when @entity1 unveiled not one but two new @entity3 last month , it was the dawning of a new strategy for the company , which for six years had championed its single iconic smartphone even as competitors rolled out an array of shapes , sizes and features			0
but a month later , there are questions about how effective this strategy has been , particularly in regards to the @entity15 , the cheaper , colorful plastic counterpart to @entity1 's higher - end @entity16			1
though some observers see a long game in which the " fun " version of the @entity16 will still prove popular , others are skeptical , based on some early signs			1
@entity1 has not released figures breaking down sales of the @entity15 versus the @entity16 ( an earnings report on october 28 may change that )			1
but independent analysts estimate that the fancier @entity16 is outselling its candy - colored cousin by 3 to 1 or , in some cases , even more			2
@entity28 , an analytics and marketing platform creators say samples apps on 1 billion devices , says the @entity16 is winning 3 - to - 1 in the @entity33 and a whopping 5 - to - 1 ( 72 % to 28 % ) worldwide			0
reports from generally reliable sources in @entity36 say @entity1 has cut production of the phone there , less than a month after it went on sale			1
@entity41 , a @entity36 site that ran accurate photos of the @entity15 and @entity16 before they were released , quotes insiders who say daily production of the @entity15 has been cut in half -- from 300,000 to 150,000			1
part of the problem , some analysts say , is the price			2
although the @entity15 starts at $ 99 with a mobile data plan , many had predicted that it would need to be even cheaper to appeal to buyers in emerging markets like @entity36 and @entity54			1
in @entity36 , where phones are n't subsidized by mobile carriers , the @entity15 is selling for 3,500 yuan , or about $ 560			1
and though its style is all new , the @entity15 does n't sport features significantly upgraded from the @entity16 , which can be had for as low as $ 199			1
the two - year - old @entity59 can be had for free with a data plan			0
@entity61 , an analyst with @entity62 , says that selling the more expensive @entity16 , which starts at $ 199 , is good for @entity1 's bottom line in the short term			2
" but in the longer term , " she said , " it 's bad news			2
" @entity1 needs new customers to keep growing , and the @entity15 was supposed to appeal to a new , more price - conscious consumer , " she said			1
" turns out that acquisition is a lot harder than retention			0
" some retailers have responded by slashing prices on the @entity15			1
this month , @entity75 ran a promotion offering the phone for $ 50			0
@entity78 has discounted it to $ 45 through the holidays , and @entity81 is giving customers who buy one $ 50 gift cards through early next month			1
but some say it 's not quite time to write the phone 's obituary			2
" rumours on order cuts ( or increases ) from parts of @entity1 's supply chain tell us absolutely nothing either way , " @entity89 , an independent analyst , wrote recently on @entity90			2
" too many moving parts			0
" in another post , he made light of people comparing @entity16 and @entity15 sales as an indicator of @entity1 's success			1
" @entity16 outselling @entity15 ? @entity1 's growth strategy a failure			1
sell ! " he wrote			0
" @entity15 outselling @entity16 ? @entity109 and ( revenue per user ) collapse			2
sell ! " this year , @entity1 ceo @entity113 himself downplayed the amount of weight observers should place in supply - chain rumors			2
" i suggest it 's good to question the accuracy of any kind of rumor about build plans , " @entity113 said during an earnings call			0
" the supply chain is very complex , and we have multiple sources for things			0
... there is an inordinate long list of things that can make any single data point not a great proxy for what is going on			0
" and there is something to be said for your top - end phone leading the way			0
the @entity16 has hit the streets to almost universally high marks from both reviewers and users			0
@entity1 announced last month that first - weekend sales of both phones combined topped 9 million , a record for the company			0
still , @entity1 does nothing accidentally			0
the @entity15 clearly was released to appeal to customers in a way that the @entity16 could n't			1
only time will tell whether @entity1 will succeed , but it will need to see improvements before it does			0
" @entity1 has more work to do to attract the next generation of @entity16 customers , " @entity61 said			0
" the @entity15 is n't resonating as @entity1 hoped it would			1

analysts *expected* the @entity15 to appeal to customers with its low price
but , especially in emerging markets , it has n't been significantly discounted
reports say production has *slowed* , and retailers are slashing its price
but some observers say it 's way too early to predict success or failure
