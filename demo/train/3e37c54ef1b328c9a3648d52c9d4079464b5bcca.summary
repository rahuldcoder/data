-- shortly after 9 a.m. on friday , a man identified as @entity2 shot a former co-worker outside the @entity4 with a .45 - caliber weapon			1
a courageous civilian saw what happened and alerted two @entity9 officers			1
after the police caught up with @entity2 , he pulled his weapon out of a bag and pointed it at the officers who had been performing counterterrorism duties			2
the officers fired 16 shots , killing @entity2			0
in the exchange of fire , nine bystanders were injured			0
as a rule , it takes a lot to get @entity9 officers to fire their guns at anyone			1
despite a handful of isolated , but highly publicized , exceptions to this rule when officers have shot unarmed individuals over the past decade and a half , @entity27 's 35,000 - officer force remains a worldwide model of firearms restraint and veneration for human life			1
the nation 's largest police department instills in its officers that the decision to fire a weapon is momentous and should only be considered after every reasonable alternative has been exhausted			2
only when officers feel that a suspect is a clear and imminent danger to them or others can they resort to using their firearms			0
then , they must take care to not needlessly endanger innocent people who might be in the way			0
in rapidly unfolding and completely unpredictable situations , assessing the need to use firearms is often a split - second decision			1
it can mean the difference between life and death			0
officers have to sift through confusion , fear and fragmented information			0
in the incident outside of the @entity4 , it is made more difficult because the street is one of the busiest in @entity69			1
the officers had to take into account the risk of the gunman hurting potentially many people in the vicinity were he not stopped			2
when @entity27 officers do use firearm , it is a matter of great importance to the department			0
officers are questioned thoroughly and can be ordered to undergo additional training			0
they can be disciplined and even terminated			0
the police department pores over each shooting and tries to glean insights that can help better train cops			0
the message is clear : firing a gun must remain the rarest of rare events			1
for prosecutors and police executives reviewing events when all the facts are known afterward , it is a different story			2
officers can be criticized for too much action or for too much restraint when things do n't go well			0
fortunately , in the incident today , the bystanders who were shot were not seriously hurt			2
street officers are always interested in better ways to handle unpredictable situations , and police departments everywhere can not provide enough quality hands on training for front line cops			1
excellent training in firearms restraint is a vital tool that has helped drive down @entity9 shootings over time			1
in 1972 , @entity27 's finest were involved in almost 1,000 incidents in which firearms were discharged ; in 2010 , that number was just 92			0
good thing , too , because no matter the training or innate restraint of the police , there really is no safe way to deal with shootings in a crowded city			1
ultimately , the outcome is always uncertain			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity127 .			1

on friday *morning* , a gunman shot a former co-worker outside the @entity4
@entity127 : for the @entity9 , firing a gun must remain the rarest of rare events
he says it is hard to make the right decision in rapidly unfolding and unpredictable situations
@entity127 : ultimately , there really is no safe way to deal with shootings in a crowded city
