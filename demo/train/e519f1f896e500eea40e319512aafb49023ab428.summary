for many years , it was a rite of fall			0
you moved into your dorm room or new apartment			0
you started unpacking the car			0
and the first thing you set up in your new place was the stereo system : receiver , turntable or cd player , tape deck and speakers			1
the wires could get tangled , and sometimes you had to make shelving out of a stack of milk crates			0
but only when the music was playing on those handpicked cds , mix tapes or ( geezer alert ! ) vinyl records did you move in the rest of your stuff			1
to the 23 - year - old , new dorm rooms and new apartments have meant computers , @entity28 , @entity29 and miniature speakers			1
" all i had to bring was my laptop			0
that 's pretty much what everyone had , " says @entity23 , who attended @entity33 in @entity34 and now works for a local marketing and communications firm			1
" it was actually pretty good sound			2
it would get the job done			0
" " get the job done " ? that sounds like the white flag for an era that used to be measured in woofers and tweeters , watts per channel and the size of your record collection			0
related : old lps get second life indeed , the days of the old - fashioned component stereo system are pretty much over , says @entity54 , an audiophile and former columnist for the music trade publication @entity56			1
" what 's happened in the marketplace , the midmarket for audio has completely been obliterated , " he says			1
" you have this high - end market that 's getting smaller all the time , and then you 've got the convenience market , which has taken over -- the @entity64 , the @entity66 devices , playing on laptops			1
" he wishes more people knew what they were missing			0
at its best , he says , audio reproduction has " a religious aspect			2
" " there 's a primacy to audio , " he says			1
" it 's a form of magic			2
" wires and jacks of course , new technology changes things all the time			0
when was the last time you bought a roll of film for your camera ? still , for a long time -- and for a certain , often youthful , audience -- the stereo system was a point of pride			1
@entity91 , the author of the audio recording history " @entity93 , " remembers the process			2
there were boxes of tapes and cds. there might even be some vinyl			0
it could be a pain , no question			0
there were all those wires , plugs and jacks -- @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , cd , keeping track of the positive and negative strands of speaker wire			2
it was an effort just to break down and set up the stuff , never mind moving it			0
@entity91 , for example , grew up in @entity121 , and when he went away to school in @entity123 , he had to figure out what he was going to do with his system			2
" i remember agonizing , what do i do ? i ca n't take my stereo , " he recalls			1
" there was this thing that , looking back on it , took up a ridiculous amount of psychic energy			0
" audiophiles vs. am radio however , he observes that the history of audio technology has often been one of convenience			1
even in the ' 50s and ' 60s , when stereo sound first became widespread , the audiophiles had their hi - fis -- and the younger generation listened to tinny am radios and cheap phonographs			1
indeed , music styles had a lot to do with music consumption , he points out			2
audiophiles listened to classical and jazz , music from clubs and concert halls			2
on a good system , you could hear every pluck of a violin pizzicato , every inflection of a jazz singer 's vocal , recreated in your living room			1
the kids , on the other hand , listened to cruder rock ' n ' roll			0
" the seeds of the decline of what it meant to own a stereo were planted way back then , because the original audiophiles were people who were baby boomers ' fathers and mothers , " he says			2
" as rock ' n ' roll starts to become more of a thing , a lot of that stuff is produced so it 's meant to be heard on am radios			2
" a @entity181 @entity183 production -- in glorious mono ! -- would probably have driven a hi - fi enthusiast up a wall , says @entity91			2
the mass market moves on in the ' 70s and ' 80s , the twain did meet , for a time			0
rock and pop music production techniques improved			2
at the same time , grown - up baby boomers , now working adults , invested in better audio equipment , all the better to listen to @entity194 's " @entity193			1
" there were whole mass - market stores devoted to audio gear -- @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 -- and no issue of @entity202 was complete without several ads for turntables , cassette decks and equalizers			1
but technology marched on , and so did change			0
some was for the sake of convenience : cassettes had more hiss and less range than @entity214 , but were more portable -- especially when listening on your handy @entity215 or boombox			1
however , we also started focusing more on visuals			0
@entity54 traces the decline of the stereo system to the early ' 80s rise of the music video , which brought visuals to the fore			1
suddenly , the concert hall in your living room -- or the audio imaging in your head -- was gone , replaced by surrealist pictures overwhelming the television 's tiny speaker			1
that branch of consumption has helped lead to the home theater			0
@entity54 has nothing against hdtvs and 7.1 systems , but believes that , for the most part , it 's a " sonic compromise			0
" with a pure audio system , " there was no way that television , even today , simulates the realism of visual experience the way ( good ) audio can simulate an audio experience			1
" sure , technology has adjusted			0
new materials and processing technology have improved the sound of small and inexpensive devices , says @entity256 , president and ceo of the consumer electronics giant @entity258 , which manufactures such brands as @entity260 , @entity261 and @entity258			0
headphones and an @entity263 and there 's still a consumer market for good audio , adds @entity266 , an executive at the high - definition audio company @entity267			1
the top - selling products in @entity269 , after @entity269 's own devices , are headphones , he says			1
( @entity267 recently introduced technology for an immersive system called @entity273 : @entity274 , intended for mobile devices			1
) still , convenience still rules			0
which means it 's out with the component stereo system and in with the computer			1
that suits @entity23 , the @entity33 graduate , fine			0
he grew up in a house with a component system but does n't believe he 's missing anything			1
" all you need is a good pair of headphones and an @entity263 and that 's pretty much it , " he says			1
@entity91 , the author , ca n't question his decision			0
" now , why even bother ? " he asks			0
" if you can take your entire music collection and more in something that fits in your pocket , why would you not do that ? "			0

for decades , the component stereo system was the way to listen to audio
now it 's all about computers and @entity64 devices
has quality been lost ? maybe -- but convenience has n't
today 's young music *fan* : " all you need is a good pair of headphones and an @entity263 "
