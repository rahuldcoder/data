gun debate ? what gun debate ? @entity2 seem to have this settled			1
yes , we witnessed on our tv screens this week yet another parade of children being evacuated from their school â€” this time in @entity9 -- their arms held high to show they were not armed as they fled a 15 - year - old shooter who police said took the life of their 14 - year - old classmate			1
but @entity2 , ever more desensitized to the school / mall / navy yard attacks that come , weekly , into their lives , do n't seem to want to talk about a gun problem			1
@entity2 remain pleased for the general population -- even 15 - year - old kids -- to have nearly unfettered access to all manner of firearms , including assault rifles			1
even the president seems to have acquiesced			0
a tweet from @ @entity29 : " ' if public opinion does not demand change in @entity32 , it will not change			0
' -- president @entity34 on legislation to prevent gun violence			2
" what this means is that we 've accepted school shootings and other random mass shootings as a normal part of life in @entity2 , no matter how they affect the life , liberty and pursuit of happiness that was first announced in the @entity48 , some 13 years before our oft - quoted @entity49 and the @entity51			1
i guess that 's not surprising : we accept collateral damage for other privileges we enjoy			2
we tolerate a certain number of drunk driving deaths , more than 10,000 in 2012 , and there 's little public outcry for greater restrictions			0
we 've been willing to sacrifice nearly 7,000 soldiers ( and tens of thousands wounded ) in two wars to maintain our political influence in the @entity65			0
about 400 children drown each year in pools and spas , but we 're not scrambling to outlaw summer fun			0
why should guns be any different ? in the @entity2 only about 10 people out of every 100,000 are killed by guns , or a little more than 30,000 per year ( as a reference , we lost about 60,000 soldiers in the @entity74 )			1
this is clearly an acceptable sacrifice to make to maintain our sacred , un-infringed right to bear arms , no ? after all , i 've been told by some gun - rights advocates that reasonable restrictions on gun ownership will undoubtedly send us down a slippery slope to the abolition of all guns in @entity2			1
and if we did n't have unfettered access to guns , think about what would happen : we would be overrun by a foreign power ; our government would assume totalitarian control and burn the @entity49 ; and criminal gangs , the only people left with guns , would run roughshod over all law - abiding citizens			1
if you suggest , as i have , that we should place reasonable restrictions on guns , then you are clearly a delusional or ignorant pacifist who has been dropped on his head			2
what part of " shall not be infringed " do n't you understand ? they ask			2
( for the record , i 'm a responsible gun owner			0
) i 'm confident that in the next few weeks there will be another school shooting			1
i 'm confident because there have been 74 shootings on or around schools or colleges in the year and a half since the @entity110 massacre			0
that 's averaging one a week			0
i 'll repeat : we have a gun problem in this country			0
reasonable restrictions on guns will not lead to totalitarianism and anarchy			2
suffering 30,000 gun deaths annually is not a reasonable sacrifice to make in order to blindly maintain our unrestricted gun culture , particularly when the rallying cry is an outdated reference concerning infringement which , known to anyone who has actually studied the @entity49 and our founding fathers who drafted it , was a reference to the then - existing reality that young men , when called upon to defend the state and the laws of the state , were expected to provide their own arms			1
listen , reasonable restrictions are necessary to assure the continued viability of our @entity140 rights , and to curb the unnecessary bloodshed caused by the proliferation of guns into hands of irresponsible people who care little about constitutional rights , and less about the sanctity of life			0
like that of a boy in @entity9 , who was shot dead .			0

@entity153 : @entity2 appears to have settled its gun debate
he says *inflexible* owners must view school shooting as collateral of " right " to bear arms
he says we do n't further restrict *drinking* because of @entity164 . have we made that deal on guns ?
@entity153 : face it : restricting guns wo n't hurt @entity49 , cause anarchy ; it will *protect* us
