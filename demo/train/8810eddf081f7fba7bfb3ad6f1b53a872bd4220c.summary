if anyone calls current events in @entity2 a civil war , do n't believe them			1
this has been a war between the @entity2 people and elements of their government , a battle for their freedom and against tyranny and dictatorship			1
much more like a revolution			2
it started like a carnival , a peaceful demonstration , an expression of people 's will to join @entity19 and shift away from @entity20			1
but the @entity2 @entity21 was over very soon			1
then the troops moved in and death took over			1
this was no longer a carnival			2
on february 18 , the war reached it bloodiest peak , and i was there , at the @entity32 -- the main square in @entity34 -- bearing witness to the drama and bravery of my own people			1
earlier that day , protesters supporting a free @entity2 had met the requirement set down by government officials -- that they release their hold on @entity43			1
and they expected the @entity45 , in turn , to meet their requirements -- deliver the resignation of president @entity48 , release political prisoners , restore of the constitution of 2004 , and investigate the repression of peaceful protesters			1
but , so far , they had n't			1
instead , the deputies were not making any decisions			2
we watched as many of them instead chose to flee the @entity45 building , which was protected by four rows of governmental special forces			2
across from them was just one row of self - defense guards -- protecting the civilians -- armed with just shields and wooden sticks			2
people in civilian clothing were beyond them			1
and then there were the protesters			1
@entity72 , our coordinator from our self - defense group , was with us when we returned to the @entity45 building			0
@entity72 told us to beware , that this most likely was a trap			0
it looked as if the deputies -- representing the president 's party -- had no intention of meeting protester demands			0
instead , they were just luring protesters from the @entity84 -- where they were protected by the barricades -- out into the open , where they could be captured and arrested			1
more and more special forces surrounded @entity87 , moving in from all sides			0
we went closer to the right flank of the special forces on the corner of @entity93 and @entity94 alley			0
i saw them approaching about 100 meters ( 110 yards ) away			0
suddenly we heard people screaming and ambulance sirens			1
some of the injured protesters were dragged to safety			1
i could not find my colleague in the crowd			0
some people began running away from the front line shouting , " they are killing us , they are using kalashnikovs and real bullets ! " special forces started attacking			1
running forward with their shields , beating people by their batons			1
there were not enough guys from our self - defense group there ; most of them were near the @entity45			0
here we saw mostly civilians -- men and women , old and young -- being beaten and chased and shot			0
none of them were prepared for what was happening to them			0
then , people started panicking , screaming and running away			1
the narrow street was jammed			0
i kept filming , but @entity72 was begging me to leave			0
suddenly , i saw special forces less than 5 meters away			0
@entity72 was leading me through			0
he kept saying " when the crowed pushes , walk slowly , make baby steps , pay attention to all details , do n't let agonizing crowd push you down			1
" when the crowd bumped me and my the camera against the car , @entity72 yelled at me -- " run ! " we ran toward the square			1
it was safer there , but just for a moment			0
we saw that the four rows of special forces that were protecting the @entity45 were now breaking though the line of self - defense guards and starting to attack , beating people without mercy			1
and then they started shooting			0
they were also attacking us from the left and from the right			0
our only chance to escape was through the narrow street			0
opinion : what the @entity161 owes @entity2 the panic was increasing , people shouting and kicking , many faces were covered by blood			1
i saw @entity168 -- the riot police , the elite and most cruel unit of special forces -- approaching a few meters away			0
@entity72 told me to run as fast as i could			0
the crowed pushed people to the wall of the building and i almost smashed my head over the corner of a balcony			1
i dived under it and the @entity168 passed me by			0
in that moment , @entity72 , a guard from our self - defense group , had just saved my life			0
meanwhile , people ran to the @entity32			2
a state official proclaimed that anyone who stayed in the square would be considered a terrorist and the special forces would clean up the square over the next hour			2
pretty soon they started to attack the heart of the revolution -- the main square , the @entity194 of @entity195			1
in the evening the whole square was burning			2
protester tents , flags , and key buildings were destroyed by fire			0
i 'll never forget the voices of the girls ringing from the stage , still singing heroic @entity2 combat songs while the square was being eaten by fire			1
that day , february 18 , many people were killed , many injured			2
but the @entity32 remained free , for the people			2
we were exhausted , but we were victorious			0
two days later , the government 's special forces chose a different tactic to try to stop the protestors			1
they planted snipers on the roofs of the buildings			0
the snipers would fire down into the crowds			0
on that day , about 80 more people were killed			2
but even that did n't stop the people			1
on february 22 , the brutal dictator , president @entity48 , fled @entity34 in the middle of the night			1
but he did n't get far			2
but this victory was bitter			0
so many people died and many more disappeared			2
flowers and candles now cover the center of the city that burned			0
protesters who were once beaten now roam freely along the @entity84			2
a dictator has fallen , and the @entity2 people have risen			1
join us on @entity240 / @entity239 .			0

@entity242 , a *filmmaker* from @entity2 , was in the main square in @entity34 when violence erupted
she said she saw government troops attack , beat and shoot at protesters
@entity242 : attacks did n't stop people ; they stood their ground ; would not retreat
