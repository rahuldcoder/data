-- on sunday , november 2 , it will again be the end of @entity2			1
many of us will be muttering to ourselves as we wander around resetting all of our various clocks -- on the thermostat , clock radio and stove , among other places			2
sure , you 'll get an extra hour of sleep by turning back the clock by an hour in the fall			0
but if you have a regular day job , you 'll be commuting home in the dark instead of in daylight come the following day			0
why do we do this every fall ? and why do we dial forward the clock by an hour every spring ? @entity2 has been around for a good part of 20th century , but there 's no really good reason why we should continue with the status quo			1
the @entity26 government started moving into and out of " @entity2 " during @entity27 to copy the @entity28 , who said they were doing it to save fuel			1
when the war ended , the @entity26 government wisely repealed the law since it proved unpopular			0
during @entity34 , it came back -- again with the notion that it would somehow conserve resources			0
after the second war , the @entity26 converted factories from making bombs to making cars and consumer products			0
but @entity2 just stuck around			1
numerous polls show that people want to stay in @entity2 year round , or at least just stick with either @entity47 or @entity48 time and stop switching clocks around			1
two states , @entity51 and @entity52 , already keep their clocks the same all year long			0
we may have reached a tipping point to end the clock - changing madness			1
first , the @entity26 @entity58 issued a report in 2008 that examined the impact of extended @entity2			2
a four - week extension would save approximately 0.5 % of electricity per day for the country			2
put in perspective , it 's enough energy to power 100,000 households for a year			2
the second strong case for staying in @entity2 year round is that we can save lives			1
a recent study shows the switching of clocks in the spring causes a 25 % jump in heart attacks in the few days following the switch , confirming earlier research that point out the shift in time can disrupt the quality of sleep and biological rhythms			1
taking away an hour of sleep and jolting you awake in the predawn darkness is simply bad for your health , especially if you are elderly or have a heart condition , researchers noted			0
so here 's the question : if you have a chance to save lives and save electricity , would you do it ? sure you would , right ? but you have n't , and neither have i. why ? maybe because we 're all a little too sleep deprived and discombobulated to do something after all that clock - changing			1
last year , a member of the @entity101 legislature proposed moving the state to permanent @entity2 if 19 other states would join its effort			1
the @entity105 voted to approve the measure , @entity107 , but it did n't go anywhere in the @entity109			0
the idea is smart and worth revisiting			0
the hard part is how to get this more traction			0
here 's an alternative proposal : legislatures pass a bill whereby if at least 31 other states pass similar bills , their state will then switch to permanent @entity2			1
with @entity51 and @entity52 already in , that adds up to two - thirds , or 33 , states			2
thirty - three is the number of states needed to pass a constitutional amendment , and while this is not a constitutional issue , it seems like a good standard to meet			2
so how can we convince all these local governments to take on this initiative ? we need help from students , who can create interdisciplinary projects combining science , math , social studies and government , to show why we need to get rid of this outdated concept			0
if we all pitch in a little , we 'll be able to save energy and lives			1
in short , it 's about time .			0

on sunday , november 2 , it will again be the end of @entity2
@entity146 : stop the clock - changing madness and move to permanent @entity2
he says extending @entity2 could save energy and reduce heart attacks
@entity146 : let 's try to get at least 31 states to form a pact to keep @entity2
