@entity0 -- tears rolled down my cheeks when i hung up the phone after interviewing @entity6 , the sister of @entity8 , who was gunned down mercilessly last week in @entity9 in front of his two sons , ages 9 and 11			1
@entity13 heard a woman scream as he was waiting by the school bus stop with his children			0
as a member of the citizens 8th @entity18 in the @entity21 neighborhood , @entity13 naturally jumped to the aid of his neighbor			1
when the woman tried to enter her car , a man attempting to carjack her pulled out a gun			2
@entity13 ran over and jumped on the front hood to try to stop the crime , only to be shot by the gunman			1
the gunman fled on foot , but left @entity13 stumbling a short distance away , suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest			0
he collapsed in a neighbor 's yard			1
moments later , before emergency help could arrive , @entity13 died , with his sons beside him			1
i could have been faced with that choice			0
i have two children , ages 6 and 4 , along with my wife , that i would give my life to protect			0
but @entity13 's love , not only for his children and their mother , but also for a neighbor , showed me i have a lot more love to give			1
now , waiting at the bus stop with my 6 year - old , i think about what i would do if faced with a similar situation			0
i 've thought of myself as a courageous person , but after covering the story of @entity58 , i feel very small			1
@entity13 's heroism sparked a lot of discussion			2
one friend of mine even asked me , " would i prefer to be a dead hero or a live witness ? " my initial thought was that it was a cold response to such a tragic situation , but i took a day to think about how i would answer that			0
and i decided that if my wife , my mother or daughters were the potential victims of a would - be carjacker and someone had the courage to intervene , i would be eternally grateful			0
no one should judge @entity58 by suggesting he made a bad decision to put himself in harm 's way			1
if people had the heart this man displayed through his actions , we all would be living in a better place			2
as we go about living our daily lives after @entity58 gave the ultimate sacrifice , his own life , to protect his neighbor we should think about what we can do to make another person 's life better			1
i know what i 'm going to do			0
i have a list of many heroes who are part of my history and have become famous in time			0
i 'm just going to add the name @entity58 to that list			2
i can imagine that @entity13 's sons are having a difficult time understanding why their father is no longer with us , but the power of his spirit will live on , particularly with many other caring fathers			2
@entity13 's story should be an inspiration that encourages people to think less about how difficult their days are and more about taking a little bit of extra time to read to their children , answer as many questions as they have and hug them a little longer than they may want			0
i never met @entity58 , but i sure wish i did			2
his story has helped me come out of my shell and given me new purpose and a determination to use whatever strength i have to help others			0
we report on acts of death and dying every day and that can harden you as a journalist and make you numb , but it seems i do n't report enough on the impact of life and living			0
covering the story of @entity58 this past week has shown me how to open my heart a little wider , feel a little more compassionate and care a little more about others before it 's too late			1
i hope and pray that @entity13 's two young sons and their mother , @entity137 , realize that @entity13 was not only a pillar of strength in the community but that his actions provide a rock solid foundation to support the rest of their lives			1
thank you @entity58 for showing us how to love thy neighbor and live our lives as a pillar of strength			1
