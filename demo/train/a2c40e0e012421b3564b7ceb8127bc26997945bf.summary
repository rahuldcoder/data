@entity0 -- @entity3 gov. @entity2 said in an interview released wednesday that he was " a bit arrogant " when he launched his ultimately failed bid for president in 2011 , but that after spending nearly two years " in preparation " for another , he feels " substantially more prepared to run			1
" @entity2 told the @entity10 that he may have drawn undue confidence because of his experience as governor of an expansive and economically influential state			1
during a sit - down at the @entity17 meeting in @entity18 , he said that experience made him feel he could " step into that role of candidate and stand up in front of the @entity25 people			0
" " i was mistaken , " @entity2 admitted			1
the @entity17 governor entered the 2012 presidential race to high expectations and great fanfare in late 2011 , quickly rising to the top of the polls before plummeting to the bottom after a series of gaffes and missteps derailed his bid			1
perhaps the most infamous -- his declaration of " oops " when he forgot the final federal agency he 'd nix if he became president -- continues to dog him as he contemplates another bid			2
@entity2 acknowledged the fact that his 2012 failures will shadow his political future , but he said he believes @entity25 would give him another chance if he decides to run again			1
" it 's never going to go away , " he said of his failed bid			2
" it 's always there , just as @entity53 's 1988 [ long - winded @entity52 ] convention speech is always there			2
it 's always part of your past			0
i 'm a big believer that @entity25 ... are interested in how do you perform after you 've been knocked down			0
" but he was satisfied with how his 14 - year tenure as governor of @entity3 had turned out , as @entity3 continues to boast a strong economy , he said			2
@entity2 also expressed pride in @entity3 ' transformation from " an intellectual and cultural backwater to a place that is very much on everyone 's radar screen on where would be a good place for us to either relocate or expand			1
" the governor said that experience would be part of his main pitch as he runs again , something he said @entity25 wo n't find in " another relatively young , inexperienced @entity25 senator or a congressman for that matter			0
" @entity2 , if he does run , will likely face a wide array of challengers for the @entity83 nomination , many of them members of the @entity85 or @entity86			1
and he said he 'd perform much better in a second presidential campaign after spending " the last 22 months in preparation			1
" " i 'm comfortable i 'm substantially more prepared to run for the presidency , " he said			0
" i know the challenges			0
and so , again , i 'm not ready to pull the trigger and say i 'm in , but i 'm comfortable that the process i 've put in place here is a proper , timely and thoughtful process			0
" " the decision [ about running ] may be no , but it will not be a no because i 'm not prepared , " he added			0
those preparations have included multiple trips abroad and chats with policy experts , including former secretaries of state @entity101 and @entity103			0
and he 's become a more outspoken critic of president @entity105 on immigration in recent months , framing his own experience governing a border state as a competent alternative to @entity105 's handling of the nation 's immigration problems			2
on wednesday , he told the @entity10 that the president 's expected executive order delaying deportations of thousands of illegal immigrants is " unconstitutional " and " unlawful			2
" " it is bad public policy , and the @entity25 people are not for it , " @entity2 added , calling on @entity117 to send various immigration reform measures to @entity105 's desk to put him on record explaining his opposition to any such reforms			1
but he framed himself as a pragmatist against the more conservative voices in the @entity83 calling for the president 's impeachment over the executive order			1
" no , " he said , asked about whether impeachment should be on the table for the @entity83 in the party 's response			1
" i think the @entity25 people want to see government work			0
... i do n't think the vast majority of people see impeachment as government working			0
that is a last ditch effort to stick a finger in the eye of the president			0

gov. @entity2 of @entity3 says with 22 months of preparation , he 's ready for another bid
*voters* will give him a chance to *overcome* 2012 campaign gaffes , @entity2 believes
he says impeachment should be off the table for the @entity83 response to executive action
