-- @entity1 atoned for an embarrassing second half penalty miss to complete a hat - trick and give @entity4 a dramatic 3 - 2 win at @entity6 sunday in the @entity7			1
@entity4 had to come from behind twice to claim the three points at @entity9 's but it was tough on the newly promoted home side , who played a full part in a pulsating early season encounter			1
they went ahead after 16 minutes when @entity15 headed home at the far post after a fine cross by @entity19			0
the lead did not last long as @entity1 , signed from @entity21 in close season , chested home a cross and fired across @entity25 in the @entity6 goal			1
the visitors looked uneasy in defense throughout -- despite @entity29 and @entity30 being re-united in the center -- and in the second half a slip by @entity34 allowed @entity35 to head @entity6 ahead again			2
@entity37 's men looked set to level for the second time after @entity39 had fouled van @entity1 to earn a penalty			2
the @entity42 got up to take the spot kick but appeared to change his mind halfway through his effort and could only chip a weak effort which @entity25 tipped away			0
" i do n't know what i was thinking of with the penalty , " @entity1 told @entity47 at the end of the match			2
" i was going to blast it but at the last second i just changed , that was n't good enough			0
" but it did not take long for him to make amends , reacting quickly after a @entity29 header came off the home woodwork			0
then in injury time he met @entity60 's near post cross with a perfect header to win the match and score his 100th @entity7 goal			1
@entity37 was delighted with the three points and gave particular credit to second half substitute @entity66 , who turned the match their way			0
" he changed the game completely , his vision and consistency of passing gave us complete control , " said the @entity4 boss , who was winning his 599th out of 1,000 league games			0
in the earlier kick off , @entity21 showed they could do without @entity1 's goals with a 2 - 0 win at @entity81 , who have made their worst start to a top flight season since 1963 - 63 with one point from three games			1
@entity88 's men had failed to score in their first two @entity7 games , but two of his summer signings came good at @entity92			2
@entity94 striker @entity93 scored his first goal for the club in the first half while @entity99 midfielder @entity98 grabbed the second for the @entity101 in the second half			0
@entity81 goalkeeper @entity103 was at fault for the goal to complete a lackluster display by new manager @entity108 ' team			0
the other game sunday saw @entity110 held 1 - 1 at home by @entity112 , needing a superb equalizer from @entity115 star @entity114 on the hour mark to salvage a point			1
@entity119 's first - half opener had given @entity112 the lead and @entity121 had to produce good saves to deny @entity123 and @entity124 as the visitors pressed for a second .			1
