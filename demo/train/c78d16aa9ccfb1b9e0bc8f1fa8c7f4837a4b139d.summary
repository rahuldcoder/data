-- is there room for one more music - streaming service on the @entity4 ? some music - industry heavyweights are betting the answer is " yes			1
" @entity8 , an offshoot of the uber - successful headphone company @entity7 , launched on tuesday with a focus on mobile			1
it 's available for @entity15 's @entity14 and @entity16 , @entity18 devices and @entity20 phones			2
a specialized @entity22 version is in the works			2
it enters a crowded landscape populated with the likes of @entity27 and @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 and numerous other competitors			2
the difference , according to its creators , will be beats ' human touch			0
" no one was doing a music service ; everyone was building a music server , " beats music chief executive @entity37 told @entity38 , a @entity0 content partner			1
while other streaming platforms will have bigger music catalogues , @entity7 is banking on its more robust suggestion engine -- or , as a blog post tuesday said , " bringing you the right song for right now			1
" like other music services , @entity7 will use a computer algorithm to help suggest new music for you based on what you 've already listened to			2
but that system factors in things like gender and age in addition to your current playlist			0
it even considers which songs you crank up the volume on , compared to which ones you listen to quietly , and what you play during the work day compared to what you stream at home			0
and there 's a team of curators and behavioral scientists participating in the process as well			0
in their blog post , the company plays up their involvement , while taking a shot at competitors			0
" in our experience , it 's always been a living , breathing human who has brought us that song we fell in love with , " the post reads			0
" we tried to remember a time a robot found us magic , but all we could find were the times the robot made us laugh : ' you like @entity89 ? have you heard of @entity90 ? ' ' you like @entity91 ? here 's another song with banjos ! ' " @entity8 definitely brings some music - industry clout to the web - streaming wars			1
super-producer @entity96 , the chairman of @entity98 who has worked with artists from @entity101 to @entity102 , is chairman of @entity8 and co-founded @entity7 with dr. @entity103 in 2006			1
@entity104 , of @entity106 fame , is the company 's chief creative officer			2
the company is trying something else that 's different for the music - streaming business			1
unlike competitors like @entity28 and @entity27 , @entity8 will not have any free options			1
the service will cost $ 10 a month			1
( there 's currently a special for @entity118 customers offering service for up to five people for $ 15 per month )			1
@entity37 says it 's a model @entity7 is confident about			0
" we know people will pay for something where there is value , " he told wired			0
" enough people pay for headphones , it 's an exciting business			0
we think we can do the same thing here			0

@entity8 is the latest entry in @entity4 music streaming
service is *backed* by music - industry heavyweights like @entity96 , @entity104
service launched tuesday , will cost $ 10 per month with no free option
