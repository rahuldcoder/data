-- @entity1 rode to his second stage win of this year 's @entity3 friday as @entity4 moved ever closer to overall victory in the centenary edition of cycling 's most famous race			1
@entity9 's @entity1 backed up his triumph in tuesday 's 16th stage into @entity12 with a similar victory			1
the @entity15 rider burst out of a chasing group to catch long time leader @entity17 of @entity18 ( @entity19 ) on the final big climb of the @entity21 and finished clear in @entity22			1
@entity24 veteran @entity23 ( @entity25 ) was 47 seconds adrift			0
it was also a familiar situation among the leading contenders , with @entity28 's @entity4 protecting his five minutes 11 second advantage over @entity30 of @entity31			1
@entity30 's @entity33 team again launched numerous attacks , but @entity4 , who had shown signs of weakness on the previous day 's finish up @entity38 , easily countered the moves			2
@entity4 , all set to succeed fellow @entity40 and @entity42 teammate @entity41 as @entity3 winner , was again grateful for the support of his loyal lieutenant , @entity45 of @entity46 , in a dramatically whittled down main bunch			1
" i felt pretty tired after yesterday to be honest but i 'm really relieved to have today behind us , " he told the official @entity3 website			2
" this is an incredible position for me to be in			0
i mean , to be here one day away from @entity51 with a five minute advantage on the second place on @entity54 is really a good position to be in but , having said that , i do n't want to be too complacent at all			0
" saturday will see the @entity56 - born @entity4 tackle his final challenge in the @entity58 over 125 km from @entity59 to the summit of @entity61			0
@entity30 is likely to come under pressure from @entity64 @entity63 ( @entity15 ) , who is third overall at five minutes 32 seconds adrift , but has been showing fine late form in the mountains			0
meanwhile the specter of drugs cast a shadow on proceedings as former @entity73 winner @entity72 was among 28 people connected to the @entity76 team to be charged with doping - related offences , by prosecutors in @entity79			1
@entity72 , who is riding this year 's @entity3 , but languishes in 56th position , one hour 42 minutes behind @entity4 , is the biggest name caught up in the potential scandal			1
former world champion @entity83 is also implicated with a clutch of officials and team doctors			0
they are accused of a large scale doping operation , involving the blood - boosting @entity89 , anabolic steroids , human growth hormone and testosterone			0
@entity76 mounted a stout defense of its riders and team on its official website , saying they would be able to mount a strong defense when the case is heard in december			2
in a statement , the team expressed its " full confidence in team members involved in this affair			0
