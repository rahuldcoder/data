-- i first saw the headline early tuesday on @entity3 , a political news site where i generally start my morning			0
it 's not where i expect to see a story on breast cancer			1
then i checked my e-mail messages -- they all seemed to be about @entity9 's op - ed. students in my undergraduate class wanted to discuss it in our next session			1
colleagues expressed concern and wondered what the right response was			0
people i do n't even know sent e-mails			0
one , from a research fellow at the @entity21 , nicely summed up the general concern : " i fear that this disclosure will motivate other women to undergo preventive mastectomy , even though they do not need it			2
maybe i should read it			0
i found it to be a moving story and understood her choice			0
what i could n't understand initially was the concern expressed by others			0
as the day wore on , the story dominated the news			0
i did n't fully appreciate how much ms. @entity9 is admired and respected and had neglected to consider just how powerful a celebrity personal anecdote could be			2
if @entity39 women saw themselves in @entity9 -- then that would be a problem			1
because the logical next question is : should i get a preventive mastectomy ? then i realized something was missing in her piece ; something that should have been printed in big black letters : note : this story is not relevant to more than 99 % of @entity39 women			1
why ? because more than 99 % of women do not have the @entity52 mutation -- or the @entity54 mutation , for that matter			1
let 's be clear , the @entity52 mutation is a bad thing			1
although i might quibble with the exact numbers in the piece , the big picture is this : the mutation increases the risk of developing breast cancer about five fold and increases the risk of ovarian cancer more than 10 fold			1
it is a powerful risk factor for these cancers -- almost as powerful as cigarette smoking is for lung cancer			2
when people are at very high risk for something bad to happen , preventive interventions are more likely to be a good deal ; that is , the benefits are likely to exceed the harms			2
i 'm not saying that prophylactic mastectomy is the right choice for a woman with @entity52 , simply that it is a reasonable one			2
when people are at average risk , the deal changes			0
the opportunity for benefit is less , simply because the bad event is less likely to happen			0
but the harms of preventive intervention remain roughly the same			0
it is a fundamental precept of medicine -- one i hammer home with undergraduates ( future patients ) and medical students ( future doctors ) : patients with severe abnormalities stand to gain more from intervention than patients with mild ones			0
patients with mild abnormalities are more likely to experience net harm from intervention , simply because they have less opportunity to benefit			0
the vast majority of women do n't have the @entity52 mutation			1
they are at average risk for breast cancer			1
they should not have a preventive mastectomy			0
a few weeks ago , in a @entity119 piece , @entity117 related her first instinct when facing breast cancer recurrence : take the other breast too			1
her oncologist responded with a simple question : " would an average woman cut off her breasts ? " i hope not			0
but there is a second question for women raised by ms. @entity9 's piece : should i be tested for @entity52 ? she seems to believe the answer is yes , pointing to the half - million women who die from breast cancer worldwide each year			1
but she neglects to point out that 90 % of these deaths have nothing to do with the @entity52 mutation			1
that 's because most women do n't have the mutation and because most breast cancer is sporadic			1
opinion : @entity9 's choice : risks and benefits the few women who are likely to have the mutation are also likely to know they may have it based on the oldest genetic test of all : a strong family history of cancer			1
population - wide screening raises complex issues			2
we would want to know more about how often the test is wrong , particularly how often the test is falsely positive			0
that 's important because women falsely diagnosed as a mutation carrier might undergo prophylactic mastectomy unnecessarily			2
then there are the psychological effects , not only for the patient but also for her siblings and offspring			0
we 'd also need to know more about what a @entity52 mutation means in the absence of family history			1
ms. @entity9 's mother died of ovarian cancer at age 56			1
i 'm no geneticist , but i can guess that puts her at higher risk -- both for having the mutation and for developing a bad cancer			2
and we 'd certainly want an answer to the question : must the test cost so much ? there 's no one right choice for a woman in @entity9 's position , but she may well have made the right choice for her			1
luckily it is a choice most women do n't have to face			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			0

*professor* of medicine @entity194 *surprised* by huge reaction to @entity9 's op - ed
@entity191 fears women might wonder if they , too , should have preventive mastectomies
@entity191 : but 99 % of women do not carry the @entity52 mutation that raises the risk of breast cancer
he says women should look at family history before getting tested for the mutation
