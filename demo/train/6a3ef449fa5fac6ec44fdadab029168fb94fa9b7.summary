@entity0 -- congressional negotiators reached a bipartisan budget compromise on tuesday that would prevent another government shutdown , if approved by the @entity5 and @entity6			1
@entity8 chairman @entity7 said tuesday the deal with his @entity6 counterpart , @entity10 , would set spending levels , reduce the deficit , and relieve some of the arbitrary , forced spending cuts -- known as sequestration			1
the pair found common ground just days before a friday deadline to settle the matter			1
" we have broken through the partisanship and the gridlock , " @entity19 said			0
@entity7 said the deal was " a clear improvement " over the status quo			0
the budget deal in plain @entity27 " this agreement makes sure that we do n't have a government shutdown scenario in january			1
it makes sure we do n't have another government shutdown scenario in october			2
it makes sure that we do n't lurch from crisis to crisis , " the @entity34 @entity33 said			0
president @entity37 called the development a good first step			0
" this agreement does n't include everything i 'd like -- and i know many @entity33 feel the same way			0
that 's the nature of compromise			0
but it 's a good sign that @entity47 and @entity33 in @entity48 were able to come together and break the cycle of short - sighted , crisis - driven decision - making to get this done , " @entity37 said in a statement			2
will @entity48 approve it ? both the @entity5 and @entity6 must still weigh in , but opponents in both parties immediately raised concerns about the agreement , which , if passed by @entity48 , would mark a significant departure from repeated budget showdowns in recent years			1
sen. @entity59 , a @entity60 @entity33 , said the proposal " continues @entity0 's irresponsible budgeting decisions " by spending too much			0
" in the short run , this budget also cancels earlier spending reductions , instead of making some tough decisions about how to tackle our long - term fiscal challenges caused by runaway @entity0 spending , " @entity59 said in a statement			2
@entity7 and @entity19 have spent the past two months working on an agreement that would set government spending levels and replace the next round of deep automatic cuts -- known as sequester			1
negotiators were tasked with reaching a deal following october 's budget drama in @entity0 , when inaction by @entity48 on spending for the current fiscal year led to a 16 - day federal shutdown			1
the temporary federal spending agreement that ended the shutdown this fall expires in mid january			2
crossfire : both sides skeptical with the @entity33 - led @entity5 leaving town on friday for the holidays , negotiators worked for a deal this week to give both houses of @entity48 their best shot at quickly weighing the new proposal			1
@entity7 said they would like to get it before the @entity5 leaves town at the end of the work week , and @entity19 indicated the @entity6 wanted to consider it before it , too , recessed for the holidays next week			1
" i think conservatives should vote for it , " @entity7 said of @entity33 , especially tea party members in the @entity5 , who have focused most aggressively on spending cuts and who have tangled most fiercely with @entity37 and @entity47			1
@entity5 minority leader @entity105 said she looks forward to discussing the deal with the @entity47 caucus			2
" any budget agreement must ensure that we create jobs , grow the economy , strengthen the middle class , and reduce the deficit in a balanced and responsible way , " she said in a statement			2
should @entity37 get credit for the @entity37 economy ? details of agreement " this deal does n't solve all of our problems , " @entity19 said , noting the compromise both sides made with government spending authority expiring in mid-january			1
the proposal will raise 2014 spending for the full fiscal year to $ 1.012 trillion			0
it would save $ 85 billion while eliminating $ 63 billion in forced spending cuts to the military and other programs through sequestration to achieve total deficit reduction of $ 23 billion , budget leaders said			1
specifically , it rolls back sequestration cuts to education , medical research , infrastructure investments , and defense jobs for the next two years , @entity19 said			0
she wanted the negotiations to close corporate tax loopholes and @entity33 had hoped for a chance to make changes to entitlements			0
negotiators also did not include a proposal to extend unemployment benefits , which @entity47 were pushing for this week			0
@entity7 : fiscal dealmaker @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
