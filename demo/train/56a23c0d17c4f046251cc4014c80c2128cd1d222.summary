-- increasingly , it feels like there is no reprieve from the assault of natural disasters			1
month after month , we go from winter storms to spring floods , to tornado and hail storms , to hurricanes , to wildfires , with an earthquake thrown in every so often just to remind us that the seasons do n't always dictate the disasters			2
as a hazard scientist , i am in tune daily with the looming threats of nature and the the places that are most susceptible			0
many people , however , do n't realize the full extent of the risk they face in their own hometowns and neighborhoods			2
all it really takes is one catastrophe , like @entity28 , or the tornado that ripped through @entity30 , @entity31 , to turn everyone 's attention to the true reality of hazard risk			1
no place in the @entity37 is risk - free			1
some regions of the country are more prone to certain events than others , so in those cases it is never a question of " if , " but rather a question of " when " and " how severe will it be ? " walking the path of a killer tornado we hear about earthquakes and wildfires in @entity51 , hurricanes in @entity52 or @entity53 , floods along the @entity55 , and probably most well - known , tornadoes in the @entity58 states that make up " @entity59			1
" but it would be shortsighted to think these regions have cornered the market on natural hazards			1
a deeper investigation reveals just how widespread these natural disasters can be			1
wildfires burned more than 9 million acres in the @entity37 last year			1
although @entity51 certainly felt the heat with nearly 900,000 acres burned , three other states each lost more than 1 million acres to wildfires in 2012 as well			0
@entity69 had 1.6 million acres scorched and in both @entity70 and @entity71 , 1.2 million acres burned			0
yet we do n't hear as much about the fires in those states as we do about the blazes near @entity76 or @entity77			0
in fact , 49 states are listed on the @entity81 website as having lost acreage to wildfires in 2012			0
even @entity84 lost 3 square miles of land in 2012 , though few people would likely consider the islands to have any wildfire risk			0
opinion : how can we be safe from tornadoes ? @entity92 - driven storm surge was the lead story when @entity28 pushed ashore in @entity94 and @entity95 in 2012			1
but @entity96 had braced for the threat of @entity98 just the year before , a reminder that nature does not space these events to fit our expectations of how often surprising weather events happen			2
aside from our heightened awareness of risk in the @entity111 , 19 coastal states along the @entity106 and @entity108 shorelines all have some degree of flooding risk from hurricane - driven storm surge , stretching from @entity114 to @entity115			1
not a single one of these states has less than $ 2 billion worth of residential property located in a storm - surge zone			2
the potential of a devastating hurricane is not limited to the states we think of as traditional targets			0
and of course , there are tornadoes			0
they hit with less warning than wildfires or hurricanes and are capable of producing tremendous , almost instantaneous damage			0
it would be comforting for us who live outside @entity59 to think that wo n't happen to us			2
but the numbers tell a different story			0
from 2000 to 2011 , about 6,700 tornadoes hit in the eight states typically identified as @entity59 : @entity141 , @entity31 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity114 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			1
but 8,800 tornadoes touched down in at least 16 other states during the same time period , in @entity149 , @entity53 , @entity55 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity52 , @entity160 and @entity161			2
the @entity59 states lost $ 2.5 billion in residential property damage from 2000 to 2011 -- but consider that the 16 states outside the @entity59 suffered nearly $ 15.5 billion in damage during that same time			1
opinion : the making of a nightmare tornado are there more severe weather events now than in the past ? there 's no clear answer			1
media coverage has made us more aware , and scientific methods of detection and analysis are much better than 50 years ago			0
because disasters are reported more extensively now than ever , it might skew our perception of their frequency			0
but whether the number of tornadoes , fires , hurricanes and the like is on the rise , it 's a sure thing that the population has risen , and continues to rise each year by about 2.5 million a year , according to the @entity190			1
this means that more people will be living in areas at risk , and the number of homes , buildings and infrastructure will be greater			0
the value of the properties has increased over the years , so any disaster will cause more damage in dollars and cents			0
more often than not , people outside of traditionally perceived hazard risk regions are not prepared for a weather related disaster			1
the solution to this inattention begins with awareness and getting familiar with the best tactics to prevent or minimize damage			0
it 's impossible to prevent many of these natural hazards , yet homeowners who are aware of risk can prepare for it -- clearing brush around the house and building with fire resistant materials if they happen to live somewhere where fires have struck , for example			1
though you most likely wo n't be able to build a structure that can withstand an @entity226 tornado , you certainly can prepare and have a safe location to ride out a storm until the threat passes			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232 .			2

@entity232 : it seems like natural disasters are hitting with no reprieve
@entity232 : no place in the @entity37 is risk - free , but in some regions , it 's not " if " but " when "
from 2000 to 2011 , he says , almost *9,000* tornadoes hit states outside @entity59
@entity232 : as @entity37 population grows every year , so does the cost of severe weather
