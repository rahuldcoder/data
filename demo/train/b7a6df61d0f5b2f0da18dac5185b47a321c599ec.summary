for centuries , the lush national parks of southern @entity1 and northern @entity2 have been called home by the @entity5 , one of @entity7 's most culturally district tribes			1
being traditional pastoralists with a nomadic bent , the @entity5 have used the sprawling grasslands and forested slopes of the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 as a grazing ground for their cattle , which provide them with the milk , meat and blood they need to survive			2
but lately , these rich lands have also lured many outsiders , including large - scale hunting companies , threatening the traditional @entity5 way of living			2
" the riches and the wealth that come out of it is actually flying away from @entity5 land by the rich and powerful people , " says @entity28 , with a wry smile			1
" @entity5 land is a very rich country , or rich region , but the owners , the inhabitants , are amongst the poorest in the world			1
it 's very sad but that 's the reality			0
" read this : @entity5 tribe 's ' last stand ' aware of the precarious position his tribe finds itself in , @entity28 , a well - respected @entity5 community leader , has made it his life 's work to save his people and their way of life , whilst helping them adapt to a changing world			1
as one of the few of his generation to make it through high school and further education , @entity28 started his work as a social development activist in the early 1990s , after spending time studying in @entity63			1
upon his return to @entity2 , he organized a legal campaign opposing a government - forced eviction of @entity5 people from the country 's @entity70 plains			1
the @entity72 of @entity2 ruled in favor of the @entity5 and soon @entity28 was working to improve the economic conditions of his people too			1
" around 2000 we started to think that despite the whole struggle for land rights and human rights of the @entity5 people , poverty is growing and so many of our young people are rushing into cities , " recalls @entity28			1
" that 's when we actually said we have to find a way to create opportunities for community economic empowerment			0
" read this : ' education is the road out of poverty ' @entity28 's first idea for self - sustainability was to turn the resources available to the @entity5 -- their animals and abundant milk -- into an opportunity to create wealth for his people			1
working together with a @entity101 , a @entity100 ngo dedicated to promoting sustainable development in rural regions of the developing world , they launched a company and established five small milk processing units in five locations around the @entity5 plains			2
from milking the herds to processing the milk and producing the dairy products , the business is run entirely by women			0
the units can process up to 2,000 liters a day , making cheese , yoghurt , butter and ghee			0
" we started the milk processing plant as one way of finding a ready market for the women , " says @entity28 , who 's based his social development plan on gender equality			1
" as an economic project that will create a market where women can sell milk and engage in a cash economy , " he adds			0
" it has been going on now for the last five years and the life of the people , the life of the families have changed dramatically and women are making so much money			0
" today , the company has grown to include many arms , from an energy and water firm , to a media house producing broadcasts tailored for the @entity5 , to a community ranch that helps improve access to quality breeds			2
they are all growing organically , based on a strict business model			0
" the social investor who is investing in us is investing as an investor , not as a donor , " explains @entity28 , who is a strong opponent of handouts			0
" this social business mentality is actually creating opportunities to awaken our entrepreneurial nature ; that we use our own locally available resources to create wealth and to create sustainability within ourselves to come out of poverty , rather than depending on aid , " he says			0
read this : good @entity7 coffee wants trade , not aid it 's all part of @entity28 's determination to help his people adapt , intact , to the 21st century and avoid extinction			1
" we have created facilities here -- the radio station , the milk processing plant , the energy and water company , the internet , the library -- all these facilities to bring modern life to people , so they do n't have to rush to towns , " says @entity28			2
" when we lost our sons and daughters , rushed into towns , our women going to towns , then our lands will become empty and we might end up in an extinction			0
" he adds : " culture is not static ; culture is dynamic , it grows ; it 's like a fire -- in order for the fire to keep on burning and giving light and heat , somebody has to be putting new fire wood			0
and the culture is like that -- so generations come and go , and each generation puts its own firewood on the fire and the fire is the culture			0
