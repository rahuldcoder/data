-- @entity1 left his @entity3 audience confused and angry on saturday night when he abruptly left the stage and ended the show after only playing for about 55 minutes			1
over the short course of a 12 - song set backed by his all - male band , @entity1 stuck mostly to his new material with high - energy takes on " @entity11 " and " @entity12 , " plus four @entity14 songs ; he sprinted to the piano for a new version of " @entity17 " and strapped on his @entity18 for an epic " @entity20			1
" despite the crowd 's visible enthusiasm , @entity1 seemed displeased with its energy level			1
" @entity28 , is this an @entity30 convention ? " he asked after " @entity25 " -- a perplexing statement , since the entire floor was standing and cheering			0

) @entity1 regularly eggs on his crowds with sarcastic banter			1
at one point , he also suggested performing the rest of the show acoustically , which he joked only ten percent of fans would want			2

the audience stuck around for several minutes after @entity1 's disappearance , expecting him to return even as roadies emerged to unplug instruments and shut off the amps			1
the waiting crowd broke into a " @entity57 " singalong , but once the curtain went down , the song quickly devolved into booing and some shouting of " @entity61 --- @entity1			2
" premiere : @entity63 in the @entity64 at @entity65 according to the @entity68 , the ushers at the concert seemed equally mystified by its early ending , and a member of the security team later offered an explanation to the reporter			0
" he was n't happy with the sound , " he said			0
" i do n't know why he pulled that			0
" the paper also noted that @entity1 had several " angry exchanges " with a shirtless fan in the front row who was removed by security			2
