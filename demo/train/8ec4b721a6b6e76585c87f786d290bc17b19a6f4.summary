what 's killing the @entity2 dolphins ? the carcasses of dozens of the marine mammals , seven times more than normal , have been washing up on beaches this summer , and scientists are struggling for answers to the die - off			1
in @entity11 alone , at least 164 dead dolphins have been found this year , said @entity12 , public relations manager for the @entity13 in @entity14			1
almost half of those , 78 , have washed ashore in august , she said			1
as of tuesday , federal authorities say , they have recorded 228 dolphin deaths this year from @entity20 to @entity11			1
in all of 2012 , 111 deaths were recorded			1
the @entity22 has issued an @entity23 in response to the deaths			2
the declaration brings special federal attention to deaths as something that serves as an indicator of ocean health and may give " insight into larger environmental issues which may also have implications for human health and welfare , " according to @entity22 's website			1
the current declaration for the @entity40 bottlenose dolphins is one of 60 @entity42 the agency has issued since they were established under the @entity44 in 1991			2
causes , including infections , biotoxins , human intervention and malnutrition , have been determined for the 29 of those cases			0
early speculation into the latest deaths , which have spiked this month , is focused on an infection			1
" based on the rapid increase in strandings over the last two weeks and the geographic extent of these mortalities , an infectious pathogen is at the top of the list of potential causes for this @entity23 , but all potential causes of these mortalities will be evaluated , " @entity22 said in announcing the mortality event			0
" @entity65 is underway to determine whether an infectious agent affecting these dolphins is present in collected tissue samples			2
" @entity69 , research coordinator for the @entity13 and @entity70 , said necropsies are providing clues			0
" we 're starting now to see lesions in their lungs that are consistent with some sort of a respiratory infection , " she said			1
" we 're seeing very active lymph nodes , which means they 're actively fighting an infection			2
" both @entity81 and @entity82 , marine mammal collections manager of the @entity85 's @entity84 , said scientists are looking at the morbillivirus , which was thought to be behind a die - off of 740 dolphins along the @entity2 in 1987			1
it has been found in some of the animals studied this year , @entity82 told @entity92			0
" @entity93 is a group or family of viruses , and it includes things such as measles and distemper , " @entity82 told @entity92			0
" so that one of the big questions are facing us right now is the extent of this infection and whether or not the infection is something that 's always been there and what we 're just picking up because of increased surveillance , or is this perhaps the smoking gun that we 've been looking for ? " @entity69 said there could be other causes			2
" lung infections is one of the characteristics of morbillivirus , but it 's not the only thing that can cause a lung infection			2
so again , we 're not sure these animals are sick animals , and we 're finding problems in many of their organ systems , and we are concerned that they may be immuno - suppressed , and they may be getting any number of things that are causing them to die			0
" on the @entity85 's blog , @entity82 said the virus may be something that is exacerbated by other stresses in the dolphins ' environment , mainly pollution in the form of pesticides , heavy metals and hydrocarbons			1
the preponderance of males and calves among the dead dolphins gives rise to those suspicions			2
" males do n't have a mechanism for shedding contaminants , " @entity82 said on the blog			0
" the females shed significant amounts of their lipid - soluble contaminants through lactation , so the calf gets a hell of a dose early on in life , and some of the most outrageous levels of contaminants we 've seen have been in calves			0
" whatever the reason , dying dolphins send a warning to humans , @entity69 said			1
" bottlenose dolphins are a higher - order predator			1
they 're often referred to as ' ocean sentinels of health			2
' so when our bottlenose dolphins are healthy , it would probably indicate that we have a fairly healthy ecosystem			0
when our bottlenose dolphins are not healthy , it may very well indicate that our ecosystem is not healthy , " she said			0
dolphins may be calling each other by name the aquarium researcher also said she fears that the disease and deaths could spread south			1
" we suspect , as dolphins move , that the event will move , too			0
unfortunately we 're afraid this is going to continue for a little while , and this will continue through the fall migration , " she said , possibly reaching as far as @entity188			0
that state has its own @entity23 this year , with bottlenose dolphin strandings in the @entity196 system at three times historical averages			1
@entity199 deaths are also up there , and no cause has been determined , according to @entity22			0
for the @entity85 's @entity82 , who has been working with stranded dolphin response teams in @entity11 , the die - off takes a personal toll			1
" when you sit back and think about it , it does stick with you , " he told @entity92			0
" unfortunately , a number of the animals we 've looked at have been neonates , that is , infants			0
and as a father , that 's always hard to do			0
" @entity216 's white dolphins headed for extinction ? @entity216 netizens decry treatment of dying dolphin			1
