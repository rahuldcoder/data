-- " something there is that does n't love a wall , " wrote @entity1			0
this something is someone now : pope @entity7			2
in a strong , apparently unscripted move on his recent visit to @entity11 , the birthplace of @entity12 , on sunday the pontiff suddenly waved to the driver of his @entity14 , asking to get out			1
surrounded by guards and by children waving @entity18 flags , he got out , walked over to the wall that separates @entity20 from its @entity18 neighbors , and he did something remarkably simple but with astonishing power : he prayed			1
this symbolic gesture occurred at a well - known portion of the wall , a segment covered with graffiti			1
somebody had spray - painted a message in black : " @entity7 we need some 1 to speak about justice @entity11 look like @entity35 ghetto			1
" in bold red letters the @entity7 could read : " @entity37			2
" while @entity20 guards looked anxiously down from a nearby tower , wondering what on @entity41 was going on , @entity7 touched the wall with his right hand , bent his head , and prayed for several minutes			1
afterward , he kissed the wall , then walked slowly back to his vehicle			0
i 've myself experienced several times the haunting power of @entity11 for @entity49			1
my father was a @entity51 minister , and once -- in 1989 -- i took him to the @entity52 , the spot where ( by tradition ) @entity12 was thought to have been born			0
this is a place of pilgrimage for those devoted to the @entity49 path , and it 's also an important city on the @entity60 for @entity18 ( among them a mix of @entity62 and @entity49 , with @entity62 the vast majority )			1
this holy city , described in the hebrew scriptures as the @entity66 , was under @entity67 and @entity69 rule for centuries			0
the @entity71 controlled much of @entity72 from 1920 - 1948 during the period known as the @entity74			0
the @entity75 partitioned @entity72 after the war , but @entity77 took possession of @entity11 after the @entity79			2
it became a refuge for @entity18 at this time , largely under the control of @entity77 until the @entity83 in 1967			2
the @entity20 kept control until 1995 , when an agreement was reached with the @entity86 , although it has been a place of unease , especially during the 2000 - 2005 era known as the @entity89 , when for a period ( in 2002 ) the @entity52 itself became a battle zone for 39 days			1
some 150 people then ( mostly @entity18 civilians , with numerous @entity93 and @entity94 monks and nuns ) took refuge in the @entity52 from an @entity20 siege known as @entity99			1
a tense stalemate occurred , with the @entity101 asking the @entity20 government to let everyone inside the church go free on the 10th day			2
there was no response , although an @entity108 monk was shot and wounded that day			0
ultimately , @entity20 snipers shot dead eight people in or around the church ; they wounded at least 22 , all of them designated as terrorists by the @entity20 army			2
against this history , this pope exercised his unerring sense of symbolism			0
it 's not for nothing that he took the name of @entity7 , in memory of a saint who , in the 12th century , was regarded as the person who most embodied the life and teachings of @entity12			1
although born into a rich merchant family , he humbled himself , trying his best to conform to the pattern of life established by @entity12 , with a dedication to peace , to bringing down barriers , to expressing love in whatever ways he could			0
pope @entity7 invites @entity20 , @entity18 leaders to @entity138 peace talks @entity7 lived without pretense			1
he understood symbolic gestures like @entity12 himself , who washed the feet of those around him , who sought out those -- such as prostitutes , lepers and beggars -- on the margins of society			0
through the @entity151 , that earlier @entity7 was commonly known as alter @entity152 -- " the second @entity150			0
" one could say that @entity155 , in turn , follows him as a man who lives without pretense , who understands symbolic gestures			2
in stopping to pray by this wall of separation , he implicitly cries : tear down this wall ! he has pointedly asked @entity162 and @entity163 -- the @entity18 and @entity20 presidents -- to join him for a time of prayer and reconciliation in @entity168			1
he has called the conflict in @entity20 " increasingly unacceptable , " which is a marvel of understatement			0
( in a gesture of reconciliation , the pope did â € ” on monday â € ” accede to an @entity20 request to pray before a memorial to @entity20 victims of the conflict as well			1
as ever , he understands that it will be necessary to listen carefully to both sides in this tragic dispute			0
) as the pope 's unexpected pause by the wall near @entity11 makes terribly clear , this ugly partition that weaves through the @entity60 has become a potent symbol of the @entity20 occupation , and it 's an affront to all reasonable @entity49 , @entity62 , and @entity186			1
good fences do not , in this case , make good neighbors			0
it 's time to pull down this barrier to freedom .			0

@entity194 : on @entity11 trip , @entity7 makes significant gesture by praying at separation wall
he says @entity11 *hugely* powerful for @entity49 , a place of pilgrimage for @entity18
@entity11 a long disputed site among @entity18 , @entity20 . @entity7 's move symbolic , he says
@entity194 : in stopping to pray there , @entity155 implicitly cries : tear down this wall !
