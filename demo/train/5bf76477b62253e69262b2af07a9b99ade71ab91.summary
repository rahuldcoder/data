@entity0 -- diagnosed last year with diabetes , the rev. @entity3 point - blank refused the medicine his physician initially suggested to regulate his out - of - whack blood sugar			1
" when i got the diagnosis , i said ' i do n't receive that			2
' my doctor said , ' i do n't care if you receive or not , you 've got diabetes			2
... i 'll give you 90 days to control it on your own , " recounts @entity3 , 50 , pastor of @entity13 in @entity0			1
the city is home to more obese people than any other @entity19 city , according to the @entity20			1
at the start of that 90 - day countdown , @entity3 , his two daughters and , marginally , his wife devised their own " biggest loser " contest			1
they nixed a whole slew of comparatively high - calorie , low - nutrient favorite foods from their grocery list , ramped up their exercise -- and started talking , more candidly than ever , about how overconsumption of certain fare causes illness , injury and premature death			1
" i used to have this slogan : ' i 'm 280 pounds of cornbread - , collard green - eating man , ' " says the 6 - foot - 2 @entity3			1
" and the bigger i got , the more i laughed it off			2
then , i got this wake - up call			1
" now 27 pounds lighter than he was a year ago -- and with his blood sugar levels now normal -- @entity3 also is founder and lead facilitator of @entity46 , one in an arsenal of organizations immersed in a community - wide campaign to move @entity0 out of that notorious no. 1 slot			1
more to the point , the organized @entity52 say they aim to be exemplars of health and fitness in a nation where obesity is so pervasive that many a municipality finds itself only fractionally behind @entity0 on the obesity rankings			1
girl loses 65 pounds in fight against childhood obesity that 80 pastors of @entity0 megachurches and modest congregations alike attended the network 's last monthly meeting is a marker of progress in what is -- by consensus of a complement of doctors , dietitians , public health experts , politicians and grass - roots organizers -- a tough but winnable fight against fat in @entity81			1
it 's true that a special ambulance designed to ferry up to 1,800 pounds of human flesh broke down within months of hitting the road earlier this year in @entity0			1
but it 's also true that the city and surrounding @entity88 -- 650,000 of the county 's 935,000 residents are @entity91 -- are forging ahead in a fitness effort that has yielded a record number of bike paths and farmers ' markets			1
the " greenline " is hundreds of miles of multiuse trails for runners , bikers , walkers , strollers and such being developed on old @entity103 easements			2
there are " shared areas of fitness , " or safe zones , and a push for more sidewalks in a car - dependent region not known for being pedestrian - friendly			1
" in a city and region where deep - frying is an art form and barbecuing pork is almost a religious experience , we have made some notable steps in promoting healthy living and lifestyles , " says mayor @entity114 , one of several elected officials who have backed what he terms an " every nook and cranny " approach to fighting fat			1
more than a third of residents in @entity0 are obese , which the federal @entity132 defines as having a body mass index of 30 or higher			1
that translates , as one example , into a 5 - foot - 9 - inch adult who weighs 203 or more pounds			1
people age 19 and younger with a @entity139 higher than 95 % or more of their peers are considered obese			1
@entity0 ' protracted work against that scourge appears to be paying off			1
after exceeding the statewide obesity rate for all but four years since 1997 , @entity88 's tally of overweight adults dropped below the statewide rate in 2011 , according to the @entity148 at @entity149			0
that year , 61.5 % of adults countywide and 66.5 % of adults statewide were obese , according to @entity150 , the institute 's administrative director and executive director of the @entity153			1
the institute does not calculate city - by - city rates			1
video : corner stores help clean up obesity in @entity159 @entity149 demographers caution that two years of data are needed to affirm that what 's going on in @entity88 is a bona fide trend			0
if it is , the change results from clarifying what 's at stake , says @entity167 , chief executive officer of the decade - old @entity168 , one of the nation 's 50 regional health improvement collaboratives			1
such groups convene physicians , employers , hospitals , insurers and others with the goal of optimizing community health			2
@entity180 is the sole such collaborative in the @entity182			0
" we 've certainly captured the attention of policy - makers on this issue , " @entity183 says			2
but policy - makers alone wo n't be the deciding factor in areas such as @entity0 and @entity88			1
there , @entity191 - @entity19 comprise 52.3 % of residents , whites 43.6 % , @entity195 5.8 % , @entity196 2.4 % and those from other races make up less than 1 %			1
a fifth of the population -- across lines of race , though the poor disproportionately are black and brown -- lives at or below the federal poverty level			0
" there is such a correlation between poverty and obesity , " says @entity149 's @entity206			0
" people who are poor try to stretch their budget by buying cheaper food , processed food			0
they also live in pockets of metropolitan or rural areas where they do n't necessarily have access to healthy food			2
... there 's also a correlation between physical activity and income level			0
" with sufficient education on topics including health and nutrition also lacking , especially among the poor , says @entity229 , battling the bulge requires help from many sectors			0
a food truck vendor at an 800 - person 2012 holiday party that @entity180 helped arrange on behalf of @entity234 ended up modifying his recipes after @entity180 ' dietitians revealed the caloric and nutritional values of what he was serving			2
your brain on food : obesity , fasting and addiction " we 're trying to establish a practice , " says @entity248 , @entity180 ' manager of equity and neighborhood transformation			0
" it 's to jar people enough for them to begin to think , ' oh , i did n't even know that ' and , from there , to make adjustments			0
" in addition to those vendors , @entity183 and @entity248 cite the activities of such grass - roots players as retired corporate cost - accountant @entity261 , 77 , a full - time volunteer who donates time to , among others , @entity180			1
for a nonrelated charity fundraiser this @entity263 , @entity261 is replacing the refined sugar and some of the water in her tried - and - true recipe for strawberry cake with frozen strawberries sweetened artificially and selling that version			2
she once enlisted fellow shoppers ' help in a successful yearlong bid to get the @entity277 store where she has been shopping since 1961 to re-stock its shelves with fruit canned in natural juices instead of high - fructose corn syrup			2
she has dropped 40 pounds from a 5 - foot - 3 - inch frame that carried 238.6 pounds at its peak			2
her goal ? " @entity286 , " she says , then guffaws			0
" or , really , 130 pounds , which , on me , really is n't skinny			0
... mainly , i 'm determined to feel good -- and even now , i tend to feel good -- and to share what i 've learned about the glycemic index and so on			2
" broadly speaking , that 's an apt communal approach , says the rev. dr. @entity292 , the physician - founder of @entity293 , which operates pay - what - you - reasonably - can medical clinics for the uninsured and working poor and similarly priced memberships to its two - story , state - of - the - art gym , 10 minutes ' drive from downtown @entity0			1
every member gets a monthly consultation with a trainer and nutritionist at @entity293 , where blood pressure gauges are on the gym floor			0
center staffers run the tests and keep files of members ' fitness trajectories			0
health care costs to bulge along with @entity19 waistlines " we expect the people to work this program , " says @entity292 , a family practitioner and pastor of @entity0 ' @entity314			1
" this is not a place to come and get on the treadmill with your headphones on			0
there are probably 10 people here at this very moment who weigh 300 pounds			0
... we also probably have more success stories than i can count			0
" @entity293 has a mind - body - spirit ethos , says @entity292 , the doctor who diagnosed @entity3 's diabetes			2
it considers the everyday financial , social and cultural concerns that can and sometimes do factor into obesity			0
collectively , the @entity3 clan has dropped 97 pounds thus far			0
( @entity3 's youngest daughter , a college freshman , leads the pack , shedding 50 pounds			0
at 5 feet 8 inches tall , she used to weigh 230 pounds			0
) " the data shows that @entity0 is one of the most obese cities in the nation			1
when i look around , i see that			0
i saw it on myself , " @entity3 says			0
" even now , i 'm still overweight and i 'm still working at this			0
... we saw what could happen within our own family , then we took it to our church , to other churches			2
the @entity350 says ' people perish for lack of knowledge			0
' sometimes we 're just ignorant to things			0
... that ignorance is part of what we 're trying to change			0
" like @entity358 on @entity359			0

more than a third of @entity0 ' residents are obese
church leaders and other groups are determined to slim @entity0 down
" we have made some notable steps in promoting healthy living , " the mayor says
grass - roots activists are also playing a role
