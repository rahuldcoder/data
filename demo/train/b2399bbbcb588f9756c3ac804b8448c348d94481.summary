-- airport stopovers are seldom the highlight of any business traveler 's journey			0
hours whittled away in generic fast food outlets or tacky themed bars , which in many cases represent the extent of terminal building entertainment , ensure onward journeys ca n't come quickly enough			0
for those passing through @entity14 in @entity15 , however , a brief window between connecting flights is a great opportunity to explore one of @entity20 's most happening destinations			1
the city - state 's condensed landscape -- the entire country is squeezed into a land area smaller than most big cities -- means visitors can quickly tour some of @entity15 's most famous attractions and be back at the airport in a matter of hours			1
@entity14 itself offers free city tours to passengers with a stopover of five hours or more but visitors can also leave the airport to traverse the city on their own accord			2
with the help of @entity40 , travel editor of @entity43 's @entity42 edition , we highlight some of the must - see @entity15 sights for those with a few spare hours between flights , whatever the time of the day			1
see also : @entity20 's budget airlines spread their wings early morning a stroll in @entity15 's lush @entity52 at sunrise provides a great opportunity to catch the normally bustling metropolis in one of its more tranquil moments , says @entity40			1
dense green foliage is complemented by a selection of finely manicured greens and picturesque lakes , a genuine oasis amidst the concrete jungle of high rises and skyscrapers			0
from here , a short trip down the nearby @entity68 , one of @entity15 's main retail thoroughfares , allows for a spot of shopping			1
it also has good transport links back to the airport			0
" gadgets are particularly cheap " in @entity15 , says @entity40 , and there are plenty of bargains to catch the eye , especially at @entity81 on @entity82			2
all those splashing out while in the city should be mindful not to forget they are eligible for a @entity87 refund ( worth 7 % of their total purchase value ) when they pass through customs at the airport , he adds			0
afternoon in the shade the @entity15 sun is at its strongest between lunch time and late afternoon , with temperatures regularly reaching as high as @entity96 ( @entity97 )			2
indoor activities at this time of day can therefore offer a more comfortable pursuit for those dashing around on a tight time scale , says @entity40			2
fortunately , the city 's art galleries and cultural centers provide plenty to see and do whilst offering an air - conditioned sanctuary away from the midday sun. the @entity108 , @entity109 , and @entity110 are within walking distance of the city 's famous @entity112 , which is easily accessible from the airport by either bus , tour bus or taxi			2
for those less charmed by artistic endeavors , the area 's many stylish restaurants , coffee houses and bars offer an equally quaint cultural experience			0
spectacular sunset a good way to get a sense of @entity15 's vibrant skyline is to find a perch on one of the city 's many rooftop bars come sundown , says @entity40			1
@entity134 at the @entity136 complex and the @entity137 at the @entity138 offer particularly appealing vistas , as well as highly agreeable @entity140 , he adds			0
those looking for a panorama of the city without the alcoholic beverage can take a ride on the @entity146 , a 165 meter - high observation wheel -- similar in concept to the @entity149 -- that enables spectacular 360 degree views			0
suitably impressed by the city 's vast neon silhouette , visitors can then head down to the neighboring @entity156 district for a genuine @entity15 eating experience , says @entity40			1
see also : business traveller in @entity15 restaurants such as the @entity160 offer local specialties such as crab bee hoon ( mud crab cooked with rice noodles ) while cramped food stalls and bustling coffee houses crackle with the chatter of locals late into the night			0
@entity169 like all major modern cities , @entity15 offers just as much to see and do come night time as it does during the daylight hours			2
low highlights the @entity169 at @entity15 's world renowned zoo as a particularly fun attraction for families and wildlife lovers alike			1
visitors can get up close and personal with a variety of nocturnal animals -- @entity15 zoo is famed for its policy of keeping animals in open enclosures rather than in cages -- before hopping in a taxi back to the airport			0
low also singles out @entity189 , home to @entity15 's vibrant ex-pat @entity191 community and a remnant of the city 's previous incarnation as a @entity196 colonial trading port , as a particularly authentic night time activity			1
" ( @entity189 ) is as close as you 'll get to the @entity15 of the old days , " says @entity40			1
he says friday nights and weekends , when the streets throng with market stalls and " the redolent scent of spices and colorful flowers " are the best time to visit .			0

@entity15 's condensed nature means it is possible to explore the city in just a few hours
@entity43 's @entity40 says there are scores of activities for those short of time
he highlights visiting the @entity52 and @entity189 as two genuine @entity15 experiences
