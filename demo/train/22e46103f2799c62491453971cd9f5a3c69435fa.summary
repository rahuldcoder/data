a @entity1 state legislator is proposing to ban the captivity of killer whales for entertainment at @entity5 in the wake of @entity8 's controversial documentary " @entity9			1
" " it is time that we embrace that the long - accepted practice of keeping orcas captive for human amusement must end , " state assemblyman @entity10 , a @entity11 from @entity12 , said at a press conference friday at the city 's oceanfront pier			1
@entity10 was joined by " @entity9 " director @entity9 , two former @entity5 orca trainers and an animal welfare activist			1
" this is about greed and this is about corporate exploitation , both of the whales and the trainers , but most importantly the whales , " said @entity24 , a former @entity5 orca trainer who resigned in august 2012			1
a @entity10 statement described the proposal as " landmark legislation calling for comprehensive improvement to orca protection laws in @entity1			2
" currently , there are no laws prohibiting the captive display of orcas , but there are federal laws governing the care , capture and research use of the killer whales , @entity10 said			1
the documentary , produced by @entity49 and acquired by @entity50 , recounts the 2010 death of longtime @entity5 trainer @entity52 by a killer whale named @entity54 , a 12,000 - pound bull , in @entity56 , @entity57			1
@entity5 also offers orca shows at a third site , in @entity60 , @entity61 , but the @entity1 legislation would apply only to @entity5 's @entity64 facility			1
the film challenges the concept of keeping killer whales for entertainment and implies @entity54 had been driven to madness by captivity			0
since then , a fiery controversy has erupted			0
@entity5 strongly disputes the allegations that " @entity9 " makes and called the film grossly one - sided and the product of animal activists			1
on friday , @entity5 spokeswoman @entity76 criticized the bill			2
" the premise behind this proposed legislation is severely flawed on multiple levels , and its validity is highly questionable under the @entity83 and @entity84 , " @entity76 said in a statement			1
" we trust that our leaders who are responsible for voting on this proposal will recognize the clear bias of those behind the bill			0
" @entity76 added the participants joining @entity10 were well - known " extreme animal rights activists , many of whom regularly campaign against @entity5 and other accredited marine mammal parks and institutions			1
" " included in the group are some of the same activists that partnered with @entity98 in bringing the meritless claim that animals in human care should be considered slaves under the 13th amendment of the @entity104 -- a clear publicity stunt			0
this legislation appears to reflect the same sort of out - of - the - mainstream thinking , " @entity76 said in a statement			0
" we engage in business practices that are responsible , sustainable and reflective of the balanced values all @entity83 share			0
" the proposed law would end performance - based entertainment for all killer whales in @entity1 , captive breeding programs and the export and import of genetic material , and the import and export of orcas within the state			2
also , the proposal would retire all captive killer whales to sea pens if available and would allow retired orcas to be on display , but not perform			0
the bill would limit the amount of human interaction for trainer safety , according to @entity10 's fact sheet			1
" like the elephant -- the largest land mammal in captivity -- we have realized that orcas are more complex than most other marine mammals and require more space , have a more complex social structure and most importantly need their family network ( pod ) for a happy and healthy life , " said a fact sheet by @entity10			2
currently , @entity1 has 10 captive killer whales , and seven of them were captive - born , according to @entity10			2
in the past 50 years , @entity1 has lost 14 orcas , 12 of which were caught in the wild , @entity10 said			2
" after the tragic death of @entity5 trainer @entity52 , the public has begun to question the moral justification of keeping orcas in captivity for our general entertainment , " @entity10 's fact sheet said			1
" as a state we should lead the way in ending captivity for entertainment purposes and should be ensuring our current captive population general welfare needs are taken care of , and that we end any future captivity whether it be by capture or captive breeding programs here in @entity1			0
" @entity98 said the proposed legislation " has the potential to end the deep injustice of exhibitions of captive marine life , " said spokesman @entity173			1
" @entity98 and kind people around the world have called on @entity5 to retire these deprived orcas to a seaside sanctuary , but the park continues to defend its overt cruelty , " @entity173 said in a statement			0
one animal trainer , @entity181 of @entity183 's @entity182 , criticized the proposed law , which he said " collapses under its own weight of inconsistencies , particularly with respect to animal welfare and future breeding			0
" " we still have a lot to learn about the killer whales , " said @entity181 , who used to train orcas			0
the killer whale shows ensure the animal and its ocean habitat remain in the public consciousness			0
" i am more concerned about the welfare of all species , " @entity181 said			0
" out of sight means out of mind			0

" the premise behind this proposed legislation is severely flawed , " @entity5 says
" keeping orcas captive for human amusement must end , " @entity10 says
" this is about greed and *...* corporate exploitation , " former @entity5 trainer says
@entity214 's bill comes in the wake of @entity8 's documentary " @entity9 "
