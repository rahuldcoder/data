@entity0 -- the @entity3 @entity2 on wednesday took the opposite action on tax cuts as the @entity6 , rejecting a @entity8 proposal championed by president @entity9 to extend lower tax rates for middle - income @entity3 , and then passing a @entity13 plan to maintain the lower rates for everyone for a year			1
in separate votes that amounted to political posturing in an election year , @entity2 @entity13 joined by more than a dozen @entity8 passed the @entity13 measure by a 256 - 171 margin			1
minutes earlier , a similar tally defeated the @entity8 alternative that would maintain the lower rates for income up to $ 250,000 for families and $ 200,000 for individuals for a year			0
wednesday 's votes extended a congressional stalemate over the @entity30 tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 that has come to symbolize legislative inaction in @entity0			1
why @entity2 tax vote is really about drawing battle lines for the fall last week , the @entity6 passed the @entity8 version in a sharply polarized 51 - 48 vote , while the @entity13 plan was defeated 45 - 54			1
normally , a congressional conference committee would negotiate a compromise between the measures passed by each chamber , but the volatile tax issue has little chance of receiving further consideration before the november election			1
republicans seeking to shrink the size of government oppose any higher taxes and argue the @entity8 plan of allowing rates to increase on higher - income @entity3 will stunt economic growth			2
@entity13 leaders say anything short of renewing all the current tax rates amounts to a massive tax increase on small businesses whose owners report their income through personal rather than corporate returns			0
@entity8 contend republicans are holding hostage tax breaks for the middle class -- including 97 % of small business owners -- in order to keep lower tax rates for 2 % of @entity3 taxpayers earning in excess of the $ 250,000 threshold			0
both sides agree on extending the lower rates for middle - income @entity3 , @entity8 argue , but they say @entity13 are preventing that from happening out of allegiance to a dogmatic opposition to any kind of tax increase on even the wealthiest @entity3			2
opinion : why are tax hikes politically radioactive ? @entity8 also point to polling that shows a majority of @entity3 support their approach			0
wednesday 's votes completed each party 's opening bid in what is sure to be a frenzied legislative negotiating session after the november vote			0
the economy is approaching a so - called " fiscal cliff " brought on by the looming expiration of several tax cuts as well as the approach of a series of mandatory spending cuts			2
@entity6 votes on competing tax plans @entity1 's @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity2 measure extends the @entity30 tax cuts for everyone
@entity2 @entity13 reject a @entity8 version to extend most but not all tax cuts
the @entity6 did the opposite last week , passing the @entity8 plan
no further action on possible tax *reform* is *expected* until after the november election
