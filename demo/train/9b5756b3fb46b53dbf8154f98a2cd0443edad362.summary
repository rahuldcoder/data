-- when president @entity3 declared in tuesday 's @entity4 that a " woman deserves equal pay for equal work " and it 's time for the nation to " do away with workplace policies that belong in a ' @entity12 ' episode , " the @entity2 chamber erupted in an apparent display of bipartisan support rarely seen in today 's @entity15			1
you saw both vice president @entity17 and @entity2 speaker @entity18 leading @entity19 in a standing ovation			1
@entity21 reported a massive spike -- 33,000 % -- in conversations immediately after the president 's remarks about women and the gender wage gap			1
@entity28 exploded with more than 33,000 tweets per minute			0
and i 'm pretty sure that wherever he was , even @entity31 put down his @entity33 cigarette , stirred his @entity35 whiskey , and rose to his feet in support			0
@entity3 's soft sell on income inequality but as welcome as this seemingly bipartisan display of support for women may be , it stood in stark contrast to what has happened in the real world			1
it 's been five years to the day since the president signed his first piece of legislation , the @entity50 , which restored legal protections for women who are victims of pay discrimination			2
that law was intended to be a first step			0
but since then , @entity19 has been sitting on its hands when it comes to closing the gender wage gap			1
we need measures that will support women as they increasingly fill the role of both primary caregiver and primary breadwinner in today 's @entity66 families			2
a standing ovation in a joint session of @entity19 will not put food on the table for 42 million @entity66 women living on poverty 's edge			1
a standing ovation wo n't create workplace policies that keep them from having to choose between caring for their families and bringing home a paycheck			1
and a standing ovation certainly wo n't change the fact that women as a group still make only 77 cents on the dollar as compared to men -- even less if you are black or @entity88			2
if 2014 is to be , as the president calls it , the @entity91 , there are things we can do right now to close this gap and help millions of women fully participate and thrive in our economy			2
@entity4 : @entity99 vs. political reality @entity19 can start by passing the @entity101 so that women ca n't get fired for asking their co-workers about their pay			1
as @entity106 pointed out this week , " how will a woman know she 's being paid less if she ca n't ask ? " today , nearly half of all workers labor in jobs where they are either prohibited by policy or discouraged by their employers from talking about their pay			2
they can face severe consequences if they do , including termination			0
the good news for @entity19 in this election year is that this issue has the support of most @entity66 , regardless of geography , gender , race or party affiliation			1
and if @entity19 fails to act , the president has been clear that he will			1
he 's already raised the minimum wage for federal contractors			2
another opportunity for action is an executive order that protects employees from retaliation by federal contractors for discussing their wages with co-workers			0
an executive order may not have the staying power of legislation , but it will move the needle for the approximately 25 million @entity66 working for federal contractors , many of whom are women			0
states can also be leaders in creating more gender equity in today 's workplace			1
several states have adopted legislation strengthening their equal pay protections beyond what is required by federal law			0
additionally , @entity151 , @entity152 and @entity153 are providing paid family leave , and @entity155 now offers paid sick days			0
these states are demonstrating that change is not only possible , but can be profitable : businesses have reported that with these policies in place , they have experienced reduced turnover and increased productivity and morale			2
and businesses need not wait on @entity15 -- as some are already proving			0
many have revised workplace policies to provide flexible schedules , paid family leave and paid sick days to help ensure women are not penalized in the pocket book for shouldering the lion 's share of their family 's caregiving responsibilities			1
together we can close the gender wage gap and in so doing cut the poverty rate for women and their families in half and add nearly half a trillion dollars to the national economy			1
when we lift women , we lift @entity66			0
but now it is up to us to act			0
we ca n't just tune out			0
you see , @entity31 is fiction			0
but the gender wage gap is very real			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			0
