@entity0 , @entity1 -- when you think of protection from the h1n1 flu virus , you may not think the hog population is what needs protecting			1
but that 's precisely the concern among pork producers and those who use swine in research studies			1
professor @entity14 wears specially issued gear as he checks on the hogs at the research facility			1
forget any worries you may have had about catching the often - called " swine flu " from a pig			1
@entity22 professor @entity14 , a swine nutrition and management expert at one of the school 's swine research facilities , says it 's actually the other way around			2
" if we are sick and we come in here , we can easily transfer [ diseases ] , especially flu , to these pigs , " @entity14 says			2
@entity14 took @entity2 on a tour of the university 's research facility to demonstrate the precautions in place year - round to make sure its pig population remains safe			1
for starters , anyone who wants to visit the facility has to shower and put on specially issued overalls and boots and that rule applies to reporters and even the hog farmers themselves			2
" they will shower to go and see their own pigs , " @entity14 says			0
this university 's swine research barn is typical of most large - production hog facilities , @entity14 says , stressing that it 's so secure " flies can not even come in here			1
" " @entity57 can be transferred by flies , by birds			0
there 's no way a bird can get into this building			0
so these pigs are very , very safe , " he explains			0
" we are more a risk to them than they to us			0
" so let 's say a pig does happen to come down with a disease , specifically with @entity73			0
then what happens ? @entity14 says the first sign that something is wrong is usually lack of appetite			0
" they go off feed , so we know there 's something not right			0
" if it does turn out to be a flu virus , @entity14 says , the treatment is very similar to what humans undergo			2
" we put them on medication and within three days it 's over			0
just like when we get [ the ] flu -- we go to the doctor and then they prescribe medication and we get well			2
" @entity14 points out that since @entity73 is a respiratory illness , the actual carcass of the pig -- the pork we eat -- is still harmless			2
still , @entity14 says he understands the initial knee - jerk reaction			0
after all , " swine flu " was what everyone called it at first -- before health organizations began referring to it as @entity73			1
" i also see the concern of consumers			0
when there is this situation everybody tends to connect the two			0
but there is no connection at all between the flu and pork , " he says			1
" there 's no fear in eating pork based on the scare of the flu pandemic			1
" the disease most people in the @entity119 and worldwide have been calling swine flu is actually a combination of human and animal strains			1
it has not been shown to be transmissible through eating pork			0
in an already suffering market , the negative news is something the @entity119 pork industry says could have been prevented			1
" this flu is being called something that it is n't , and it 's hurting our entire industry , " @entity130 , communications director for the @entity131 , said last week			1
" it is not a ' swine ' flu , and people need to stop calling it that ... they 're ruining people 's lives			2

researchers say hog population needs protection from human diseases
fear over so - called " swine flu " has hit pork industry hard -- and *unfairly* , many say
@entity1 facility says humans must wear special suits to keep hogs disease - free
" no connection at all between the flu and pork , " researcher says
