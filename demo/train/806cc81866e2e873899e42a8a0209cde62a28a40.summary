i love being spoiled by my kids , but something 's missing : a chance to hug my own mother			1
" @entity8 , what did you used to do with @entity11 on @entity12 ? " asks my four - year - old as we sat down to brunch			1
" well , we did lots of things , " i reply			2
" we were lucky to have a lot of @entity18 with her			2
sometimes we used to take her out to brunch or make her a special meal at home ... sometimes we went to a jazz concert with her , since that was one of her favorite kinds of music ... " i trail off			2
" @entity30 ? i do n't like jazz , " he sniffs , and then turns to his dad to ask for the syrup			2
the moment passes without my dissolving into tears , a minor triumph for me			2
parenting.com : yummy breakfast - in - bed ideas for @entity12 the last @entity12 i got to celebrate with my mom was may 10 , 2009			1
she was in a rehabilitation center after several weeks in the hospital , following the discovery that her breast cancer had metastasized and necessitated a colostomy			2
her illness aside , it was a harrowing time for our family : my husband had lost his job due to the recession ; we had had to move a few hours away as a result , my toddler son was melting down regularly as his world zigged and zagged , and , to top it off , i was very , very pregnant			2
my mom wallowed in self - pity for a few days , thinking about how uh , crappy , it would be to have to walk around with a bag of stool taped to her stomach for the rest of her life , but did her best to clutch at her usual spunky , snarky self			0
she was focused on regaining the strength to climb the stairs of her townhouse in @entity71 and hoped to make it home in time for the birth of my second son several weeks later -- which she had graciously allowed to take place in her home			0
on that particular @entity12 , she was tired from everything she had been through in the previous weeks , and i was exhausted from waddling around the city as my due date loomed			1
while my husband and toddler went exploring in the hallways of the rehab center , my mom and i sat together , trying to enjoy our time but looking forward to better days			0
i gave her a card that day that read , " i was really worried there for a bit , but i should have known that you still had some fight left in you			0
i am so grateful for the almost 23 years since your initial diagnosis , but i 'm greedy for more time with you			0
you are a remarkable woman and an amazing mom -- i really do aspire to be like you and to have my kids feel about me the way that @entity99 [ my brother ] and i do you			0
" little did we know what was to come			0
parenting.com : my most precious @entity12 gift she did n't end up making it out of the rehab in time to witness her grandson 's birth , but she eventually made it home a few weeks later			1
when her strength did n't resume as we had all expected , her oncologist paid a housecall to let us know that the cancer had spread even further , and that she should cease all treatment and start hospice care			0
she slipped into a coma one evening as my newborn son , @entity120 , and i lay beside her , and she died the next evening , with my brother and me by her side , having given us time to say our goodbyes , tell her how much we loved her , and reassure her that we would be okay			0
the @entity18 since have been tinged with bittersweet longing			0
while i 'm crazy about my boys and appreciate however they want to celebrate the day , i miss having someone to honor			1
sure , i call my dad 's partner and wish her a happy @entity12 and send my favorite aunt ( my mom 's youngest sister ) a pair of earrings much like ones i would have chosen for my mom , but there will always be something missing			1
maybe it 's because i was raised by a single mom , but i always felt the need to really make something of the day for her -- to show her how deeply i felt she was doing a great job			1
and now i also miss her vote of confidence in my parenting , since it felt like it was coming from the pro. parenting.com : the most awkward pregnancy photos ever i try to keep or create who she was for my boys , who did n't get to really know her			1
my older son , @entity151 , has vague memories of her ( or maybe just memories of what i 've told him they did together , since he only two when she died ) , but my younger son @entity120 just a few weeks old when she passed away			0
she was too weak to even hold him			0
i tell @entity151 of how my mom used to chuckle when i would call her nearly crying in frustration at his stubbornness ; not only would she would remind me that i had been similarly temperamental , but she genuinely reveled in his strong personality			0
and her laughing , while maddening , helped me to better appreciate him by seeing him through someone else 's eyes			1
when he rides his balance bike , i remind him that @entity11 gave it to him , somehow foreseeing that a gift that would grow with him would allow her to remain tangibly present in his life after her death			1
in the evening , when @entity120 climbs into his big brother 's bed to cuddle and read before bedtime , i might ask him if he knows that he was born in that bed , his grandmother 's bed and a bed that had welcomed two other generations of my family a century ago			1
and as my boys fall asleep , it 's to the sound of my off - key rendition of lullabies she made up and used to sing to me , songs i had n't heard or thought of in years but which began to ring in my ears after her death			2
and of course we keep photos of her around the house -- her house , actually , since my brother and my family and i moved back in following her death			0
parenting.com : top baby names of 2012 although @entity12 is one where i ca n't help but feel her loss , the times i miss her most are during the highs and lows of parenting -- when one of my sons reaches a big milestone like walking or learning how to read , or at the end of a long day when i 've lost my temper			1
it 's at those moments that i wish i could hear just how proud she would be , or be reminded that having a bad day does n't make you a mom failure			2
i miss her take on it all			0
and so , on this @entity12 ( and the other 364 days this year ) , i 'm trying to be the mom my mother taught me how to be , both for my sons and for myself , even as i wish she could cheer me on			1
i was taught by one of the best that it 's not about doing it all ( she could n't , as a single working mom ) or being there for every minute ( again , it literally was n't possible ) , but it 's about being fully present for the stuff that matters			1
i try to hear her voice in my head and give myself a break when i know she would have encouraged me to do so , congratulate myself for my part of the incredible mini-men my sons are becoming			0
mostly , i just remind myself to slow down and enjoy the kids that she would have so adored			0
