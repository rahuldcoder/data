-- mr. @entity1 , congratulations on your nomination to lead the @entity5			1
as a good citizen you have agreed to take on one of the most demanding and important jobs in @entity9			2
as a veteran yourself , you can appreciate how shaken veterans and their families are by the scandals and corruption that has been exposed throughout the @entity5			1
i know you will agree that we owe our veterans the best care and we have failed to deliver			2
given the scale of the challenge , i hope you will not mind if , as someone who has spent nearly five decades in politics and government and has seen scores of cabinet secretaries come and go , i share a few thoughts on the position to which you 've been nominated			0
should the @entity28 confirm you to this post , you will take command of the @entity5 at the most troubled time in its history			1
the reports of corruption , incompetence , and corruption to hide incompetence have drawn the nation 's outrage and caused your predecessor to resign			0
how might you succeed at reform where so many others before you have failed ? given your lifetime spent in business , probably you are familiar with @entity46 's famous " @entity45			0
" @entity46 used to carry around a bin full of red beads and white beads mixed together			0
he would describe to audiences his intention to gather up just the white beads , and then he would blindly plunge a scoop into the bin			0
to his ostensible frustration , the scoop would always emerge with a mix of both kinds of beads			0
feigning disbelief , he would appoint a new person to wield the scoop			0
invariably , he or she would fail as well			0
then @entity46 would proceed to the next candidate , and so on			0
the point of the @entity46 demonstration was to illustrate that a systems problem could n't be solved with new people , new slogans and new speeches			1
when the system is broken , the personalities do n't matter			1
people will fail one after the next until the system is changed			0
the range and scale of the misconduct at the @entity5 shows that the corruption there , like the doomed attempt to isolate white beads , is not just a problem of personalities but more importantly of systems , and it goes to the very core of the bureaucracy			1
the @entity5 's @entity82 is investigating at least 70 facilities nationwide for allegations that administrators altered appointment data or used secret waiting lists to make patient wait times appear shorter			1
when you have that many facilities in trouble simultaneously you are not dealing with a few bad apples , a failure of a few leaders , or a need for better inspections			2
with that many places simultaneously in trouble , you have a system and a culture that have been corrupted and are collapsing			0
the agency 's own audit found that 70 % of @entity5 medical facilities were using improper scheduling practices to hide long wait times by falsifying data			1
the wait times persist despite ( or more likely because of ) the fact that @entity5 doctors see fewer than half as many patients as doctors in the private sector			1
this is a department that has 40 % more employees and costs 90 % more money than it did in 2006			0
operating rooms close at 3 p.m. so the union cleaning staff can leave by 5 p.m. @entity118 get bonuses no matter what their performance , apparently ( though 100 % of them were given " fully successful " performance reviews or better last year -- a remarkable achievement in light of the agency 's widespread mismanagement )			2
it takes 175 days to transfer a veteran 's medical records from the @entity131 to the @entity5			1
the @entity131 and the @entity5 spent $ 1.3 billion and four years trying to build software to solve this issue before announcing in february that they had given up			1
failure this thorough points to a system -- the giant , fossilized bureaucracy -- that is hopelessly broken and must be replaced rather than repaired			1
unfortunately , the entrenched bureaucrats , the unions , and the president , along with many others in @entity142 who are ideologically committed to a failed model of delivering health care , all oppose the systemic changes that could actually work			0
mr. @entity1 , you are about to become the next guy holding the scoop at the @entity5			1
the prison guards of the past might write legislation to give you a bigger scoop , and then they will call the problem solved			0
your job , as the new champion of our nation 's veterans , will be to focus the public 's outrage and to marshal support for real change			2
opportunities to force the kind of transformation the @entity5 needs come along once or twice in a generation			1
it would be a tragic mistake if , after the enormous human pain that led to your appointment , you allowed the moment to pass			0
what would systemic change look like ? it would begin with enforcing the right metrics , with measuring success not by how well the @entity5 serves the bureaucrats but by how well it serves our veterans			1
this would mean insisting the @entity5 meet the standards our veterans are accustomed to as consumers in every other aspect of their lives -- the world where services work and are increasingly digital , mobile , virtual and personal			2
the @entity5 is a long way from that today , and to get there it will have to become a radically different agency with many fewer bureaucrats operating under a new set of assumptions			2
the fight to change the @entity5 will be big			1
but the ramifications could extend well beyond your single department			0
the whole federal bureaucracy is broken , swollen into an unrestrained fourth branch of government			2
if you can harness public support to transform the current @entity5 into a system based on choice , accountability and efficiency , you could be setting the pattern for replacing the entire bureaucratic state with a government for the modern world			2
it would be a fitting conclusion to a century plagued by bureaucracy if the renewal of @entity219 governance were to begin at the @entity5 , a department which exemplified the system 's worst tendencies from the start			1
@entity224 , the first person to hold the position to which you have been nominated , stole tens of thousands of dollars from the bureau after @entity228 , as did many of his cronies			0
the corruption is not new , but nearly 100 years of it is enough			0
i hope you will be the secretary with the courage to demand the fundamental change our veterans need			2
the @entity219 people will be with you , even if many in @entity9 are not			0
sincerely , @entity240 @entity5 boss plans ' personnel action ' this week in wait - list case @entity244 taps @entity1 to head @entity5 veterans waiting longer for cancer care join us on @entity249 / @entity248 .			1

@entity240 writes an open *letter* to @entity252 , the nominee to head the va
he says changing leaders or staff is n't enough ; systems must change
@entity259 : @entity5 is a giant , fossilized , broken bureaucracy
