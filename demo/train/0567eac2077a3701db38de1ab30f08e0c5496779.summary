-- the @entity3 could have acted sooner to designate @entity4 a foreign terrorist organization , a @entity2 official told @entity6 on thursday , adding that " resolving this crisis is now one of the highest priorities of the @entity3 government			1
" @entity11 , the principal deputy assistant secretary for african affairs , told a @entity13 subcommittee that the initial debate within the @entity2 over a terror label " was really about the @entity15 attitude towards designation " for the @entity18 extremist group that advocates @entity20 law			1
" the government of @entity15 feared that designating these individuals and the organizations would bring them more attention , more publicity and be counter productive , " said @entity11			1
" for some time we accepted that point of view			0
" pressed by sen. @entity30 , a @entity32 @entity31 , @entity11 acknowledged that " in retrospect , we might have done it earlier			0
i think the important thing is that we have done it and that we 've offered a reward for the top leadership of @entity4 's location			2
" the group , which has claimed responsibility for kidnapping more than 200 school girls in northern @entity15 last month and threatening to sell them into slavery , was added to the terror list last november by secretary of state @entity45			2
the timing of the action has triggered a political controversy around @entity49 , who preceded @entity45 as @entity3 's top diplomat and is weighing a potential run for president in 2016			1
a formal terror designation provides greater access to a group 's finances and more ability to limit its movements			1
officials said @entity4 does not have financing in the @entity3			2
some in @entity6 , the @entity61 and others called for the @entity2 to apply a terror label to @entity4 in 2012 following a bombing in @entity65 and amid growing concerns that it had @entity69 links			1
but the agency , then led by @entity71 , rejected that approach			0
officials cited the reasons raised by @entity11 , which also included the possibility that doing so might heighten threats against @entity3 and @entity79 interests			2
a letter to @entity71 at the time by the 24 academics , including former @entity3 ambassador to @entity15 @entity84 of the @entity85 , also said such a move would raise the group 's profile and possibly link the @entity3 to abuses by @entity15 forces cracking down on the group			2
republicans are now seeking to use the @entity4 terror case as well as the deadly september 2012 terrorist attack on the @entity3 diplomatic compound in @entity96 , @entity97 , to depict @entity71 as complicit in what they argue is weakened foreign policy under president @entity100			1
but former assistant secretary of state for african affairs @entity101 , who served under @entity71 , told reporters last week that the convoluted socio - economic dynamics of @entity15 required a more holistic and nuanced approach than the security focus of anti-terrorism efforts			0
" this is a very complex situation , " he said			0
still , there was swift political reaction to @entity11 's comments			0
correct the @entity111 , a @entity112 rapid - response group , said " the facts are clear and hindsight does n't change " things			0
it noted the @entity2 under @entity71 placed three @entity4 members on a terror blacklist			1
the @entity119 also weighed in , saying @entity4 was " another hard choice where @entity49 made the wrong decision			0
" @entity0 's @entity122 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 official says there was debate within agency about terror designation
there was concern that terror label would bring @entity4 more attention , status
the official said @entity4 *abductions* in @entity15 are now a top @entity3 priority
the timing of the terror label for @entity4 has now become a political issue
