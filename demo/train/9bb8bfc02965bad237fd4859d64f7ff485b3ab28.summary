@entity0 -- a @entity4 trolley operator killed in a crash last year likely had a sleep disorder and fell into a " micro-sleep " shortly before the collision , the @entity2 ruled tuesday			1
since last year 's trolley crash in @entity4 , @entity10 , there has been another incident on the same line			0
the safety board , completing a 14 - month investigation , faulted operator @entity15 for ignoring a red signal along the tracks but directed harsh criticism at the @entity19 which operates the train system			1
the transit authority failed to screen operators for sleep disorders while enforcing a work schedule that could prevent train operators from getting enough sleep , the @entity2 said			1
the @entity2 's conclusion that @entity29 fell asleep is partly conjecture , the board acknowledged			1
@entity29 , a part - time trolley operator , had an opportunity for adequate sleep the day of the wreck , although investigators were not able to determine her sleep history			1
in addition , @entity29 had been given a break earlier in the day , had not complained to co-workers about fatigue and was found to be free of drugs and alcohol			0
" we can not say for certain that she did have it ( sleep apnea ) , " board member dr. @entity42 said			1
but the @entity2 concluded there was a " high likelihood " that @entity29 had an undiagnosed sleep disorder , largely because she was obese and because tests showed she had taken doxylamine , an ingredient commonly found in sleep aids , suggesting she had trouble sleeping during at least one of the nights leading up to the accident			1
in addition , there is a lack of other evidence to explain why @entity29 failed to slow or stop the train , the board concluded			1
tests showed that the stopped train could be seen at a distance of 764 feet , and that " there were multiple opportunities to slow and stop this ( advancing ) train , " @entity2 investigator @entity61 said			2
" there was not any evidence that brakes were applied			2
" @entity73 ' westbound train was traveling at 38 mph when it struck the other train , which was traveling at 3 mph in the same direction			0
an estimated 185 to 200 passengers were on the two trains during the collision in the @entity4 , @entity10 , suburb of @entity80			0
damage was estimated at $ 8.6 million			0
the board also noted that the @entity19 had not installed systems on its @entity84 to prevent two trains from occupying the same stretch of track , the @entity2 said			1
the systems , known as " positive train control " systems , would have prevented the accident , the safety board said			2
one year after the fatal accident , more than 50 people were injured in another accident on the same line			0
the @entity4 accident highlights two issues that have risen to the top of the @entity2 's concerns in recent years , positive train control and operator fatigue			1
the safety board says positive train control issues were involved in two other light rail incidents this year , a may 8 wreck on the same @entity84 and a june 22 wreck which killed nine on @entity0 's @entity108 system			0
" if technology exists ... on the other ( @entity19 ) lines , why would the @entity84 not have everything possible ... to prevent accidents from happening , " @entity2 chairman @entity109 asked			1
" i do n't understand that as an operator ; i just do n't			0
" the metro system had a form of positive train separation , but investigators are exploring whether that crash resulted from a circuit malfunction			0
the safety board said fatigue issues affect all forms of transportation			2
it noted that two pilots fell asleep during a flight over @entity129 and that sleep issues played a role in a @entity133 ship incident in @entity134 , @entity135 , and a fatal bus crash in @entity137 , @entity138			0
@entity109 said details that surfaced in the @entity4 trolley crash will guide the @entity2 in the future			2
" now it is up to us , because we now are the advocates for these changes , " @entity109 said			0
recommendations resulting from the @entity4 crash " raise the bar of safety not only in this system , but across the @entity148			0

obesity , evidence that operator was taking sleep aid leads to conjecture
transportation board criticized for failing to screen for sleep disorders
@entity2 also notes lack of systems to prevent trains from using same stretch of track
