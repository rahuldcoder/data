@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 appeared at two recent fundraisers with some serious sticker shock			1
about 200 people ponied up at least $ 5,000 per ticket for an event hosted by @entity9			2
that was followed by a function at a private home where 60 people spent $ 38,500 each to get through the door			1
just last week , @entity3 -- with @entity15 -- raised $ 15 million in one night			1
this makes me wonder how in the hell our political process became so distorted that @entity3 needs this much money to run for re-election			1
i thought we were broke ? and yet , at the end of march , @entity3 and his presumed general election opponent , @entity24 , had raised nearly a combined $ 300 million , almost enough to fund @entity26 's annual budget by themselves			1
forget @entity28 , it 's the campaign trail that needs to be occupied			0
the median income in the @entity32 is about $ 50,000 , so i doubt very many 99 percenters are able to meet the $ 75,000 minimum that was expected at a recent @entity24 fundraiser			1
did you know the goal of the @entity38 is to raise $ 800 million by november ? imagine how many families could be helped if just half of that was used to train people for the new job market , as opposed to being spent to help one guy get hired ? face it , the president and @entity24 may have different political and economic views , but they are both propped up by highly affluent power brokers who are expecting big returns for the big checks they are writing			1
this is why the worst thing to happen to our process was the @entity59 's 2010 @entity58 decision , which allows corporations ( and unions ) to spend unlimited funds to promote a candidate			0
this is akin to handing the keys of a bakery to the @entity67			0
these big spenders are not just involved in shaping dialogue			0
they get involved with shaping policy , which inevitably makes the good of the people secondary to the good of the deepest pockets			0
we do n't just need campaign reform , we need roadblocks to prevent special interest groups from turning the democratic process into more of a sham that it already is			2
let the @entity59 keep its ridiculous ruling , but set a limit on the amount of money candidates can raise and spend on their campaigns			2
require all ads and debates to be aired on public television , and then cap the number of hours each party is allowed to use during the general election			0
by putting it on public television , we stop large media conglomerates from profiting from the process			0
so , ideally @entity3 and @entity24 would both get $ 10 million and 40 hours of advertisement to state their case			1
let 's take away the $ 200 million war chests that @entity3 has been able to amass in both 2008 and 2012 , and force him and future candidates to find a way to persuade the country to vote for them without relying on their ability to outspend their opponent			1
i know , i know , @entity24 would n't even be in the position he 's in without outspending -- and dare i say , bullying -- his opponents			1
by leveling the economic playing field , our politicians have a chance to return to being representatives of the people , not just the ones who know the right people or make the right promises			0
before making the rounds in @entity123 on monday , president @entity3 tweeted a sentence from the commencement speech he gave at @entity126 : " do n't just get involved			2
fight for your seat at the table			0
better yet , fight for your seat at the head of the table			0
" he left out the part about needing $ 5,000 to get in the door so you can even see the table			0
but i guess those messy details are easy to overlook in a country with an 8.1 % unemployment rate , whose leaders still find it appropriate to hold fundraisers for rich people			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity148 .			2

@entity148 : as of march , @entity3 and @entity24 had raised combined $ 300 million
@entity151 asks , since when did candidates need this much money to campaign ?
limits should be put on the time and money spent to *win* office , he writes
@entity151 : so many people do n't have jobs , and we *'re* fundraising for the rich
