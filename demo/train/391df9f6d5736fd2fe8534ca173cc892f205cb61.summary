-- media magnate @entity1 will meet journalists at his @entity5 subsidiary in @entity6 friday , to take charge of the crisis surrounding the embattled @entity10 newspaper , with some speculating whether he will " sacrifice " @entity13 staff to prevent the controversy from spilling across the @entity15			1
" at the moment it appears he is ready to sacrifice the journalists and journalism in @entity6 to do whatever it takes to be seen to be cleaning up his act there so that it will play better in the @entity28 , " @entity16 , a former editor of @entity1 paper @entity18 , told @entity0			1
" the consequence of that is quite amazing -- @entity10 , which is the most loyal newspaper @entity1 has ever owned -- now believes it is being hung out to dry and the @entity10 journalists are turning against them			1
" @entity1 issued a personal assurance to one of his executives that he 'll continue to own and publish @entity10 newspaper , according to an internal staff memo sent by @entity5 chief executive @entity38			1
allegations of pay - offs to public officials by @entity10 employees -- five of whom were arrested saturday -- threatens to bring the @entity13 crisis across the shores to the @entity28 , where the @entity47 prevents companies from paying bribes overseas			1
" this is for @entity1 no longer about journalism			2
this is about defending @entity53 , his @entity28 based parent company , from judicial action and investigation in the @entity28 , " @entity16 said			1
such actions could put broadcast operations , the most profitable part of the @entity53 operations , in jeopardy , said @entity62 of @entity63 in @entity64			2
" if it can be proven that anybody working for @entity53 bribed or gave money to an official of a foreign government -- i.e. the @entity13 -- that 's a clear violation and the @entity71 will start the wheels in motion , and i think that 's what @entity1 has been gearing up for in the past few months , " @entity62 said			1
all of the @entity10 employees were released on bail , and none so far have been charged			1
a wave of scandals this latest controversy surrounding @entity1 newspapers in the @entity13 also raises a larger issue of journalists protecting confidential sources and paying to get information			1
if the case moves to the @entity28 , it raises the specter of anti-bribery laws in a showdown with the @entity91 , which protects freedom of the press			2
" it 's really ironic that the greatest threat to @entity92 in @entity103 today , and around the world today perhaps , has come from @entity1 because of his excesses , " said @entity93 , the @entity94 winning journalist who , along with @entity95 , broke the @entity97 series of stories that eventually led to the resignation of @entity28 president @entity100			1
the arrests of the @entity10 employees comes after @entity1 - owned newspaper @entity107 was found to have hacked into private voice mails of a widespread range of public officials , celebrities and victims of crime			1
the phone - hacking scandal prompted @entity1 's son , @entity53 executive @entity115 , to shut down @entity107 in july			2
the best - selling @entity13 newspaper was 168 years old			1
so far , @entity53 and its subsidiary companies have paid more than $ 200 million in legal fees and settling of 59 of 60 lawsuits that have been filed in the phone hacking case			0
phone hacking : how the scandal unfolded @entity115 is now facing new e-mail evidence that would have made him aware of widespread phone - hacking at the newspaper			0
the younger @entity1 has appeared twice before a @entity13 investigatory committee and said he has no knowledge of the practice			2
while @entity1 started in newspapers , the @entity13 division of his @entity53 empire -- which includes movie studio @entity132 , the @entity133 and @entity134 -- is only a $ 1.6 billion slice of the $ 32 billion empire			1
dark side of the @entity10 " i ca n't imagine a corporate crisis that is larger than this , " said @entity139 , a contributing editor to @entity140 and author of " the man who owns the news : inside the @entity146 of @entity1			1
" " there are essentially two parts of the company : there 's the @entity28 company which comprises most of the assets and earnings , and then there is the @entity13 company that is composed mostly of newspapers , " @entity139 told @entity0			1
" that 's kind of a legacy company			0
it 's one of the places where @entity1 got his start and one of the places where his heart is			0
" @entity166 executives in @entity28 have been saying for a long time , ` why do we have newspapers ? ' " @entity139 said			2
" the legal jeopardy of his son and heir , @entity115 , gets more and more dire every day			0
i think they need to do something big and final , and i think it 's going to be getting rid of his @entity13 business			2
" the @entity10 's editor , @entity178 , has said the paper has a readership of more than 7.7 million			0
paying for stories the arrests of journalists have spread alarm , and prompted an editorial by the @entity10 that police dawn raids against its journalists were part of a " witch - hunt " that had left @entity103 behind former @entity191 states on press freedom			0
but there is a sense that the practices that helped @entity1 build his media empire are now threatening to bring it down			0
" this is a system that @entity1 set up , these are his values that the @entity10 has practiced , let 's not kid ourselves about it any more than the atmosphere in the @entity204 was about his aids and underlings , " @entity93 said			2
" it 's both a tragic story and story of real corruption -- institutional corruption , moral corruption of a journalistic institution , but at the same time we need to protect the principal of protecting sources			0
" " @entity1 had tabloid view of journalism , probably still does , that you do whatever it takes to get the story			0
the end will justify the means			0
you 've got to destroy the competition , " said @entity16 , who worked with @entity1 for 11 years			0
@entity93 said there are circumstances where paying for information is permissible			0
" such as if you are in @entity229 and you say to somebody , ' take me to a mass graves , i want to see the mass graves site '			0
( but ) is it permissible while following the royals around to say , ' here 's 100 pounds , tell me what the royal family was doing last night ' ? no. but at the same time , these bums ought to be protected along with those who practice real journalism			0
@entity0 's @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this story			0
