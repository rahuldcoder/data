-- they 're everywhere here : on the sides of buses and along the walls of subway stations , posters for the upcoming film " @entity8 " bearing little else than the three words " punk , billionaire , genius " and a partial headshot of lead actor @entity14			1
likewise , buzz about the @entity17 - directed film about the contested origins of @entity19 , based on @entity21 's book " @entity22 , " has been growing now that its hyped premiere at the @entity24 is less than a month away			2
its wide theatrical release is on october 1			0
this week , at least in the mainstream press , the narrative has taken a turn for the speculative : will the film actually be both a box - office hit and an awards contender ? will @entity19 's chilliness toward the movie , which it did not sanction and has characterized as " fiction , " affect its performance -- or will a strong performance at the box office affect the public 's perception of @entity19 ? igniting all these questions is the fact that " @entity8 " is apparently not just good , but excellent			1
the sole long - form review of the film comes from @entity46 , a publication operated by @entity24 parent @entity48			1
critic @entity50 characterized " @entity8 " as a " portrait of a self - made outsider marking his territory in the @entity56 jungle " akin to @entity59 @entity58 's classic " @entity57 , " and speculated that it may come to be considered a microcosm of the @entity62 in the same way that " gatsby " encapsulates the @entity64			1
" ' @entity8 ' offers a despairing snapshot of society at the dawn of the 21st century , so advanced , so ' connected , ' yet so closed and constrained by all the centuries - old prejudices and preconceptions about how our heroes and villains are supposed to look , sound , and act , " @entity50 wrote			2
" for @entity76 has arrived , and yet still seems unsettled and out of place			2
" a few others have seen it , too			0
in a tweet , @entity81 magazine critic @entity80 gave the movie four stars and called it " the movie of the year that also brilliantly defines the decade			0
" whether it actually is as good as a handful of early reviewers say it is , " @entity8 " could really be the first major , zeitgeisty film that portrays the " digital generation , " or @entity95 , or whatever you choose to call it , as adults -- the film that will be evoked for decades as emblematic of the climate that caused whatever generational neuroses that the " millennials " experience down the road			1
that 's something that the film 's excellent theatrical trailer , scored with a haunting choral cover of @entity113 's " creep , " starts to drum up with its emphasis on social status , the enormous amount of deeply intimate information shared online through social networks like @entity19 , and a snippet set in a nightclub in which @entity120 , portraying former @entity19 executive @entity121 , declares confidently , " this is our time			2
" the cast alone may be sufficient to draw crowds			0
@entity14 , cast as @entity19 founder @entity76 , is shaping up to look like a more astute choice than some of the better - known actors who were said to be up for the part -- a young a-lister like @entity129 or @entity130 could come across as too played - out by now , or overshadow the rest of the film			1
the supporting cast may be a big draw , too , in part because of the roles that some of the relatively unknown young actors have lined up for next year			0
@entity139 , portraying spurned @entity19 co-founder @entity138 , will be the next @entity140 ; @entity141 , playing a fictionalized version of a girl @entity76 had been dating around the time that he founded @entity19 , will be the eponymous " @entity145 " in the film adaptation of @entity148 's bestselling novel ( also directed by @entity17 )			1
some speculators had wondered whether @entity120 , a pop singer who was gracing the cover of teen magazines with the rest of boy band ' @entity154 at the time when his character @entity121 was an executive at @entity156 , would be the film 's weak link			0
perhaps not : @entity50 said that the quality of @entity120 's performance is " surprising			0
" so what of the concerns about accuracy ? " inside @entity19 , they think the movie will not be good for @entity76 's image , and that worries them , " journalist @entity164 , who wrote the @entity19 - authorized " the @entity165 , " said in an interview with @entity167			1
the article explained that @entity164 had spoken to the producers of " @entity8 " about signing on to a consultant role for the film , but that he " objected to the story " and @entity19 " said it would not cooperate on his book " if he took the gig			2
in the same interview , @entity164 said that " @entity8 " will " fundamentally misrepresent @entity19 's origins " but that its only real impact will probably be to " make @entity76 ( @entity76 ) a celebrity			1
" entertainment blog @entity186 brought up the fact that while some believe that straying from history cost the 1999 @entity192 film " @entity193 " the @entity195 accolade at the @entity196 , fictionalizing some detail did n't derail 2001 's " @entity198 " from winning the same award			0
a story in the @entity201 about @entity19 management 's grappling with the potential success of " @entity8 " -- including attempts on behalf of the company to lobby for modifications to the script -- mentions that a " mostly made up " scene " that depicted @entity121 ... delivering his dialogue while a pair of teenage girls offer partygoers lines of cocaine from bared breasts " was in cutting - room limbo			1
but while this allegedly contested scene in " @entity8 " sounds sleazy enough to make the film seem a little bit more lowbrow than your average @entity196 contender , it certainly has been pulling in more buzz			1
when it started to look like the scene was staying in the picture , it instantly became headline - worthy			0
" @entity120 's naughty party scene uncut in ' @entity8 ' , " a @entity186 headline read			2
@entity228 was a little bit blunter : " boobs and cocaine wo n't get cut from ' @entity8 ' after all			0

critics ask : will " @entity8 " be a box - office hit and an awards contender ?
@entity48 could be the first major , zeitgeisty film that portrays @entity95
*facebook* executives are concerned it will be bad for @entity76 's image
