-- if your coach airline seat is uncomfortable , it 's your fault			1
that 's the gist of one of hundreds of responses to a @entity0 report about airline seat comfort , configuration and cost			1
coach fliers may complain about airline seats , but @entity15 airlines are filling those seats pretty successfully			1
a commenter called @entity18 suggests that consumers are getting what they ask for			1
" i will continue to blame the passengers that will sit in any crappy seat as long as it 's a little bit cheaper			1
that is why the airlines are doing this			1
not because they are mean , because that is what most travelers want ... " in the report , a top body measurement expert says @entity15 are getting bigger , and seat - makers have been basing their designs on the wrong body parts			1
a seat maker says the industry simply builds what the airlines want			1
an airline spokesman says passengers are more interested in cost rather than comfort			2
have you seen the new numbers for airline passenger traffic ? @entity50 ! from the looks of it , seems like carriers are n't having any trouble selling seats , even if they are less than royal thrones			1
@entity15 airlines hauled 53.1 million passengers in february			1
that 's an increase of 6.1 % over traffic in february 2011 and 9 % above the same month in 2010 , according to the @entity15 government			1
but the numbers also show that airline profits are down a bit , probably due to higher fuel prices , according to the @entity66			2
@entity67 says airlines have some work to do			2
" the domestic airlines need to get back into the customer service business			2
spread the seats out , get rid of the flight attendants with an attitude or have behinds wider than the drink cart , trash the toy airliners and get the real ones back , and start serving real food again			2
then , charge whatever you need to so you can make a reasonable profit			2
those who can afford to fly - will - and those who ca n't - wo n't			0
then , at least flying wo n't approximate the pain of a root canal any more			0
" are there any new ideas out there that can spread some sunshine among grumpy fliers ? @entity91 suggests bringing in @entity92			0
" sometimes , we need the government to save us from ourselves			2
there should be a mandated minimum width of seats and legroom			2
do you really think it is safe with all those people packed in like sardines ? we needed the government to mandate auto safety , and should have the same on airlines so that everyone is reasonably comfortable and safe in flying			1
i am not a fat person , but the way they jam us on airplanes , it is just not fun to fly anymore			0
" speaking of the government , @entity113 is predicting a slight dip in domestic passenger traffic this year , before it starts to rise again in a steep slope that will ultimately see air travel nearly double during the next 20 years			1
hopefully , passenger size and weight wo n't be doubling			1
@entity15 's battle with weight is bleeding over into airline cabins			1
commenter razorback10 , who wanted to do the right thing , was faced with a difficult choice			0
" i flew this last weekend			0
i am overweight and so looked at the website to see if there was anything i needed to do			0
it recommended buying two tickets , so i did in the section with extra legroom			0
get to my seat and it turns out i do n't need the seatbelt extension , i was suprised and informed the stew that i had purchased the 2nd seat so they would n't be looking for the person who was n't showing			0
the flight is full and there is a waitlist			0
they actually bring a guy on the plane to ask if i was willing to give my 2nd seat up for him			0
i politely said no , nodded at him and resumed reading my book			0
i was terrified of flying because of the bigotry , i sure as hell was n't going to give up the extra seat i paid for so some guy to take it and then likely complain later			0
" it 's hard to know whether commenter @entity156 was being serious or facetious when he suggested this : " i think they should charge fares based on weight			1
you and your luggage get on a scale when you get to the airport			0
you get a refund or have to pay more compared to the ' average ' price you paid			0
i weigh significantly less than the ' average ' @entity15 so why should i supplant the cost of flying those who are larger than i am ? want to save money lose weight			1
" of course , frustration is n't the only emotion travel inspires			0
otherwise , why would we do it ? we want to hear about your greatest travel moments , whether serendipitous or carefully planned			0
what sticks out to you as your biggest travel success ? share your stories below .			0
