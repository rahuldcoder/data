-- it was a quiet sunday morning in @entity2 and i was photographing people who were registering to vote			1
it was my third day in @entity6 and i was wondering if i 'd made a mistake , hopping on a plane and flying for over 20 hours to document a struggle that i had made my struggle since i was 10 years old , growing up in @entity11			1
then the serenity of the scene was pierced by a thunderous noise and a succession of pops that i thought were gunshots			1
i ran for cover behind an open van door			2
i looked up and realized that a bomb had exploded			2
i paused in fear , then touched the small cross that my grandmother had placed on me before i left the @entity24 , clutched my camera tightly and ran towards the bomb -- as if i 'd been doing that all my life			2
on that sunday morning , the struggles for freedom in @entity6 became all too real to me			1
as an only child raised by a single mother in the inner city of @entity11 , i was fascinated with @entity6 , her racial divide and her struggles			1
i was in middle school when i first really understood what apartheid in @entity6 meant			1
black children , just like me , being beaten and segregated by the ruling government			2
it just was n't fair			2
so , i could n't imagine that years later i 'd be standing next to and ultimately spend significant time with the hero of that struggle , @entity43			1
as a photojournalist , i 've had the privilege of covering @entity43 nearly a half dozen times over the past two - and - a - half decades			1
i was there when he was elected in 1994			2
and when he was inaugurated a few days later			2
i watched as he raised his hand and took the oath , rising from prisoner to president			2
i was with him for his retirement in 1999 and his 90th birthday celebration at his tribal home in @entity57 in 2008			2

i 'm so grateful to have met and briefly gotten to know him through my lens			2
i first covered @entity43 in 1990 right after his release from prison , when he visited @entity11 where he was honored and received his @entity66 union card at the @entity68 factory			1
he was honored for his work with and support for organized labor			0
on his visit i was at once touched by how amazingly pleasant he was after having been imprisoned for 27 years			1
there was n't even a hint of the bitterness or anger			0
i understood clearly that he had struggled through great oppression , but how could he have emerged so at peace ? how could anyone endure such pain and forgive his enemies ? it was 1997 , three years after i witnessed @entity43 become president of @entity6			1
i had decided to attend @entity86 's presidential inauguration , but was n't sure what angle i was going to take			0
while journalists and everyone else were obviously there for @entity86 , i found out " @entity43 " -- a term of endearment for @entity43 -- was going to be there			1
i said to myself , " that 's who i 'm interested in			0
" as i wrestled through the logistics and security , i was told by someone at the door , " not only will you not get a photograph of him , you wo n't be able to get in a room with him			0
" in a moment of self - doubt , i believed that			0
then i remembered his own struggle , what he went through			0
in that moment i determined i would not -- i could not -- be deterred			0
well , i not only got in a room with @entity43 -- thanks to the encouragement of a man named @entity116 who worked in rep. @entity118 ' office -- i photographed him and was able to talk with him			1
after i was initially turned away , it was @entity116 who told me that i could do anything i set my mind to			0
i have always been believed that you have to act like you belong , so with that in my mind and the extra encouragement , i managed to talk my way into the room			0
i explained to president @entity43 that i had been selected to be in the motorcade when he was in @entity11 a few years earlier , and that i was honored then , as now , to photograph him			1
i do n't remember what he said , his lips moved but i probably could n't hear him over the loud beating of my heart			0
i do remember he smiled			0
although my heart was fluttering , i was able to stand right in front of @entity43 as he smiled and patiently waited for me to take the picture			1
i did n't just photograph him ; he graciously let me take pictures with him			0
the last time i photographed @entity43 was at his home in @entity57 , for his 90th birthday celebration			1
during the party , there was a special moment for me when i just waved at him and he smiled at me			0
i could n't believe it			0
the way he smiled , i was in awe			0
he was so gracious , so down to earth , so real , that there was no logical reason for me to feel awestruck			0
@entity43 comes into the world only once			1
he was someone who not only wanted peace , but lived his life full of love , so much so he was able to forgive his enemies and strive for unity			0
when you were in his presence , he gifted you with his genuine smile and strong spirit ; he generated a sense of calm serenity			0
it was as if he knew something the rest of us did not , and clearly , he did			0
in my eye -- and in my lens -- his is the standard for leadership based in love			0
i look at things differently because of him			0
the experience of being exposed to @entity43 has made this little girl from @entity11 grow into an unapologetic , world - travelled woman , inspired to remain fearless in the face of adversity			1
@entity43 changed my life , my world and how i see it			1
