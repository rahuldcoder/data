@entity0 , @entity1 -- keep your shoes and belts on : waiting in long airport security lines to pass through metal detectors may soon be a thing of the past			1
airport security checkpoints may become opportunities for screeners to study passengers ' intentions			1
security experts say focus is shifting from analyzing the content of carry - ons to analyzing the content of passengers ' intentions and emotions			1
" we are seeing a needed paradigm shift when it comes to security , " says @entity23 , ceo of @entity24 , an @entity1 - based security company			1
" this ' brain - fingerprinting , ' or technology which checks for behavioral intent , is much more developed than we think			1
" nowhere is the need for cutting - edge security more acute than @entity1 , which faces constant security threats			1
for this reason , @entity1 has become a leader in developing security technology			1
several @entity1 - based technology companies are developing detection systems that pick up signs of emotional strain , a psychological red flag that a passenger may intend to commit an act of terror			1
speedier and less intrusive than metal detectors , these systems may eventually restore some efficiency to the airplane boarding process			2
one firm , @entity49 ( pronounced " we see you " ) technologies , employs a combination of infra - red technology , remote sensors and imagers , and flashing of subliminal images , such as a photo of @entity59			2
developers say the combination of these technologies can detect a person 's reaction to certain stimuli by reading body temperature , heart rate and respiration , signals a terrorist unwittingly emits before he plans to commit an attack			1
with these technologies , the emphasis is on speed and seamlessness			0
@entity75 , ceo of @entity49 , envisions a day when a passenger can breeze through a security checkpoint in 20 to 30 seconds			1
although traditional security profiling can discriminate by race and religion , security experts say behavioral profiling is more fair , more effective and less expensive			0
@entity49 has received grants from the @entity84 within the @entity86 @entity85 , which hopes to implement a system to pinpoint internal threats such as airline employees intending terrorist acts			0
once these technologies are in place , a passenger may pass through a security screening without realizing it			1
for example , passengers could use an automated check - in system or gaze at a screen with departures information without realizing they 've just been exposed to the words " islamic jihad " written in @entity102			0
these stimuli , explains @entity75 , will intrinsically elicit some sort of biometric response -- whether the passenger knows it or not -- that can be picked up by @entity49 's strategically placed sensors			1
" i believe that we introduce a new layer in security , " @entity75 says			0
" this is something that could n't be done in the past : finding the connection between a certain individual and the intent to harm			0
" the orwellian - sounding startup has gone further to develop a system that detects a passenger 's behavioral intentions by scanning their every step , literally			1
while walking around certain parts of the airport terminal , a passenger may not realize he has stepped on a " smart carpet " filled with hidden biometric sensors			2
the technology is still under development , says @entity75 , who believes it will be strong enough to pick up biometric information from a footstep			0
if a passenger is wearing heavy hiking boots , for example , @entity49 will rely on biometric sensors combined with video and thermal biometric imaging to detect malicious intent			1
another option from @entity49 is a " smart seat , " or cushion full of hidden biometric sensors that could provide a more detailed read on someone sitting in an airport waiting area , @entity75 says			0
while the technology sound like something from a @entity150 flick or even " @entity151 , " @entity75 insists that passengers will not find the techniques intrusive			2
" we do n't want you to feel that you are being interrogated , " he says			0
@entity75 is negotiating contracts with airports worldwide and believes his company 's technology may be implemented as soon as 2010			2
@entity160 , another @entity1 - based technology company , believes the key to a person 's emotions and intentions lies in their voice			1
the company 's patented @entity168 , or @entity160 , technology can pick up verbal cues from a passenger who may pose a threat			1
unlike a polygraph test , which checks for lies , @entity160 's systems work as an " emotion detector , " says @entity160 ceo @entity177			2
in other words , it 's not what passengers say , but how they say it			2
@entity160 's devices use a series of patented signal - processing algorithms that can differentiate between a " normal " voice and a " ' stressed " voice			1
if emotional stress is detected , officials can determine if the passenger should be taken aside for further questioning			1
the system works on the premise that all voices have a certain frequency , and any deviation of that baseline frequency can indicate stress			0
@entity177 says it takes approximately five to 10 seconds for their system to capture a " normal " voice in casual conversation , which establishes a baseline			0
their system then measures changes from the baseline voice that signify an increase in stress , excitement , anticipation , hesitation or other emotions that can indicate a potential terrorism threat			2
a computer processes the voice patterns and then flashes words such as " high risk , " " medium risk , " " excited " and " highly stressed			1
" through his system , @entity177 says , he " can see what 's going on in your brain			0
" versions of @entity160 's system already have been successfully tested at @entity227 , where officials used it to target criminals and drug traffickers			0
a version was recently implemented at another major international airport which @entity177 declined to identify			0
@entity160 also has been used to test for insurance fraud and on the tv program " big brother @entity236			0
" @entity160 has limitations , including the inability to trace the vocal patterns of a person with a speech impediment			0
but the system is more effective than current security measures , claims @entity177 , who believes a terrorist currently can pass through airport security with explosive material " that can take down any plane			1
" in fact , many experts express little confidence in the current state of airport security			1
@entity255 , @entity256 - based editor of @entity257 , says would - be terrorists could easily slip through security checkpoints , even with new regulations that check for liquids			0
" the archaic system of an x-ray machine and metal detector can not pick up other potential threats posed by passengers , " @entity255 says			0
" i can have a ceramic weapon or chemical weapons and walk through an archway metal detector and it wo n't be picked up			0
yet we have huge faith in these metal detectors that can only pick up one substance			0
" @entity23 , whose consulting firm focuses on securing mass transportation systems , is equally skeptical			0
" it is possible today to hijack an aircraft using only five or six able - bodied passengers who are well - trained in @entity280 fighting , " he says			0
" there is no technology in place in airports to detect a threat like that			2
" the question is , should our desire be to look for each and every threat agent , rather than focus our efforts on identifying the [ violent ] intention of the passenger ? "			2

airport security screeners ' focus is shifting towards studying passengers ' intentions
@entity1 companies have become leaders in developing security technology
systems can detect signs of emotional strain , which may signal a passenger 's intent
other programs can study passengers ' voice patterns for signs of stress
