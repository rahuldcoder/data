@entity0 -- think this current climate of political polarization is bad ? things could get even uglier in 2013			2
with a third of the @entity7 and every seat in the @entity9 up for election this year , each side is already bragging about how likely it is they will win back or take over the next @entity12			1
but if the past three years are any indicator , no matter if the @entity14 or @entity15 control the @entity9 or @entity7 -- or both -- gridlock , brinkmanship and stalemate could continue to plague the next president and frustrate the @entity22 electorate			1
the ongoing back and forth friday between the @entity9 and @entity14 leadership over exactly who is at fault for the weak economy offers a glimpse into what 's in store			1
" one of the things that people get so frustrated about is that instead of actually talking about what would help , we get wrapped up in these political games			2
that 's what we need to put an end to , " president @entity37 said on friday , a day when politicos on both sides of the aisle played the blame game over the country 's fiscal troubles			2
voters have been clear in expressing their displeasure with @entity12 , whose approval ratings -- currently only 15 % of @entity22 polled think @entity12 is doing a good job -- have been in the basement for much of the past few years			2
and it does n't stop there			2
just look at , for instance , @entity12 ' work habits			2
the @entity14 - controlled @entity9 's frequent election - year recesses do little to clear the mountain of legislative work off their plates and have rankled such @entity15 colleagues as @entity9 minority leader @entity61 , @entity62			1
" instead of recessing yet again , the @entity9 should remain at work and pass critical legislation that will create jobs for the middle class that will actually be signed into law			1
republicans must not run out the clock on the economy , " @entity61 wrote in a letter to house speaker @entity69 , @entity70 , this week , adding that the upcoming recess is the ninth weeklong break this year			1
whether president @entity37 or @entity14 @entity77 occupies the @entity78 next year , both men are facing an indigestion - inducing plate full of domestic problems			2
either one could , for instance , have to preside over a dramatic overhaul of the health care reform law if the @entity84 strikes down the individual coverage mandate as unconstitutional this month			1
the original law passed in 2010 without a single @entity14 vote in the @entity9 or the @entity7			1
the backlog of bills that have passed in one chamber but are in limbo in another include the hotly debated transportation bill			0
many @entity9 @entity14 want any deal on the transportation construction measure to include approval of the @entity98 oil pipeline			0
in the @entity7 , both parties are at loggerheads on the best way to address mushrooming student loan rates			1
if the balance of power in the @entity7 shifts to the @entity14 , as some political analysts expect , or @entity15 and @entity14 end up with a near equal number of seats , partisan gridlock could become even worse			1
both the @entity108 and the @entity109 suggest that at least two to four @entity7 seats are in play , including open seats in the battleground states of @entity114 and @entity115			1
seats in @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 are also competitive			0
" you can expect these bitter times to continue , " said @entity121 , a senior fellow at the @entity122 and co-author of the book " it 's even worse than it looks : how the @entity22 constitutional system collided with the @entity128			1
" it 's little wonder why			0
a new @entity132 study found that the nation is more politically polarized than it has been in the past 25 years and " the values gap between @entity14 and @entity15 is now greater than gender , age , race or class divides			0
" so , there 's little chance of compromise on solutions for shoring up the ailing economy and stanching job losses as the country braces for the impact of more than $ 1 trillion in mandatory budget cuts set to kick in next year			1
should @entity37 win re-election , he 'll be a second - term president facing a narrow window to accomplish policy goals before he enters the lame duck phase of his office			0
" if president @entity37 is re-elected he will have to work with a @entity14 @entity7 to define his legacy , " said @entity154 , deputy editor of the @entity109			1
@entity37 's " big opportunity will be 2013			0
" that 's the same year sequestration , massive mandatory across the board budget cuts , are triggered as part of a congressional deal that allowed @entity37 to raise the debt ceiling			0
the large defense budget , which many @entity14 lawmakers defend as necessary to maintain , will face substantial cuts			0
ironically , @entity37 may have to take a harder , more partisan line in order to get his agenda passed , @entity121 said			2
" it 's his second term			0
the country is facing serious problems , " @entity121 said			0
" if the @entity14 are playing an opposition game i ca n't imagine he can peacefully engage in constructive negotiations with ( @entity14 )			0
he would find the same problem he faces today			0
" things are n't likely to go much easier for @entity77			0
if @entity77 should win the general election and his party maintains control of the @entity9 and ekes out a @entity7 majority , the newly minted president may still face some political headaches			1
candidates down ballot may get a boost from a @entity77 win , but it is unlikely his party will net the 60 seats needed for a filibuster - proof @entity7 majority			1
he 'll also face intense pressure from his party to keep his campaign promises and steer clear of compromise			0
" if @entity77 is elected he 'll have a brief honeymoon period , " said @entity193 , director of the @entity195 's @entity194			0
" in this polarized era i see no reason for optimism there .			0

partisan *bickering* likely to continue after elections
health care , economy remain wedge issues
@entity7 power shift could happen after 2012 election
