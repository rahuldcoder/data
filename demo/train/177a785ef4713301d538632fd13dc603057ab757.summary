@entity0 was 19 years old , 5 feet tall and around 180 pounds when she remembers her boyfriend saying the thing no boyfriend is supposed to say : " you know , you 'd look better if you lost weight			1
" " no duh , " she thought			2
like many teenage girls , it was nothing she had n't thought to herself , every hour of every day			0
in @entity0 's case , she said she knew she was overweight and just figured she 'd always be that way			1
" he was the tall , blonde , skinny type of guy who had no idea what it was like to be a short , @entity19 , chubby teenage girl , " @entity0 wrote on @entity12			1
" i shopped in the ' missus ' section of @entity22 and felt like an old lady at 19 , trying to fit into ' mom jeans , ' thinking that crying in the dressing room was totally normal and how i was supposed to live			0
" it was the summer of 2003			0
it was n't that @entity0 , who wore a size 16 in most clothes , ate so much -- she just ate all the wrong things			1
convenience store junk food , meals at @entity33 , big family dinners heavy on pasta , rice and bread , and doughnuts on saturdays before soccer games or swim meets			0
it was how all her friends ate too , and half of them were skinny			0
" i 'm just made to be bigger , " she would tell herself			0
" i 'm just built this way			0
" she did n't think it would work , but when that tall , skinny boyfriend of hers suggested she lose weight , she felt obligated to try			1
" but how ? " she asked			0
he told her his mom had lost a bunch of weight on the high - protein , low - carbohydrate @entity54			1
she cut out carbs and switched to meals consisting of mostly meat and vegetables ; cut all soda and juice , and drank only water and unsweetened tea			0
@entity65 : try it now ! fill half your plate with fruit and vegetables " though it was difficult to explain to my family that i could n't eat tortillas or plantains for a while , they were supportive of my goals , " she wrote			0
each night in her room , she exercised to belly - dancing workout tapes she picked up at the mall			1
a year later , she had lost 60 pounds			1
she sported a 27 - inch waist , an hour - glass figure and a new aura of self confidence			2
" i might never be the skinny @entity86 - doll figure i had in mind , but neither would i allow myself to fall into bad habits that would make me think less of myself			2
i finally could shop in the ' normal ' sections of the stores , though it never became any less surprising to find myself looking for clothes marked medium , " @entity0 wrote			1
" here i was , in college , feeling healthier and happier than i ever had in my entire life , with the realization that i had the power to do whatever i put my mind to			0
" and the guy ? " it probably wo n't surprise anyone that i broke up with the boyfriend			2
" she reached an all - time low of 125 pounds by the time she finished college in 2005 ; she currently weighs 130 pounds and wears a 6 or 8 dress size			1
@entity0 , 30 , now lives in @entity108 , @entity109			1
she got married , became a graphic designer and tours as a heavy metal vocalist with the band @entity113			0
her legal name is @entity115 , but she kept @entity0 , the name she grew up with , as her stage name			1
the low - carbohydrate diet is her way of life			1
a typical day consists of two scrambled eggs with spinach for breakfast ; a salad with tuna and oil and vinegar for lunch ; some cheese , pickles or cucumbers for snacks ; and some kind of protein and vegetable for dinner			2
" i know that to sustain my weight i have to keep foods heavy in carbohydrates like cookies and cupcakes to ' treat ' status			2
... sometimes events like birthdays and holidays crowd each other , and i find myself eating treats more often than i should , " she said			0
" it can be difficult when all of my friends are doing it , so i have to make sure to work out extra hard to make up for the extra carbohydrates			0
" @entity0 works out three to four times a week to make sure she 's fit for the stage			1
" not only has my weight improved , but so has my stamina , " she said			2
" my dream now is to be able to run around the stage with the energy of ( @entity160 lead singer ) @entity161 until i 'm too old to scream			0
until then , heavy metal is my life , and the demons associated with my weight are the enemies i will never let conquer my brain , ever again			2
