-- the @entity1 tuesday overturned a lower court ruling that terminated the parental rights of a @entity5 woman whose son , the woman says , was adopted without her consent while she was imprisoned following an immigration sting in 2007			1
the court ruled that the state violated its own laws in terminating the parental rights of @entity14 , but the supreme court sent the case back to the lower court for retrial rather than return the boy to his biological mother			1
" the trial court plainly erred by entering judgment on the adoption petition and terminating @entity28 's parental rights without complying with the investigation and reporting requirements ... , " judge @entity21 wrote in the court 's principal opinion			1
" the trial court 's judgment terminating @entity28 's parental rights , allowing the adoption to proceed without @entity28 's consent to the adoption , and granting of the adoption , although supported by clear , cogent , and convincing evidence on the record , is reversed			1
the cause is remanded for a new trial in which @entity41 and @entity28 will have the opportunity to present evidence on all claims in all counts of the petition that pertain to @entity28			0
" @entity14 was caught up in an immigration sting in may 2007 , six months after her son was born			1
she was not deported , however ; instead , she was imprisoned as an illegal immigrant who used a stolen @entity50 number to work at a poultry processing plant			0
her brother and sister took care of the boy at first , attorneys in the case said			2
eventually they sought help from a clergy couple who offered baby - sitting services			0
when that couple asked to adopt the boy , @entity14 said no , her attorney , @entity62 , said			0
rebuffed , the couple introduced the boy to @entity64 and @entity65 and eventually put him up for adoption -- something the boy 's biological mother said they lacked the legal ability to do			1
the @entity72 soon asked a judge for temporary custody , said their lawyer , @entity75			0
@entity14 -- in prison at the time -- did not contact the @entity79 or their attorney or object to them having custody , he said			2
after a judge granted the @entity79 temporary custody , they waited a year -- rather than the six month minimum stipulated by @entity86 law -- before asking to adopt the boy , @entity75 says			1
@entity14 said she did not fully understand what was going on and certainly did not give her blessing for them to adopt her son			2
in october 2008 , a judge approved the adoption , ruling that @entity14 had abandoned her child by not trying to contact the @entity79 for a year			2
@entity14 said she does n't speak @entity94 and was left with no way to ask for help to plead her side			0
in addition to the clergy couple not having the authority to put up her son for adoption , @entity62 has argued that @entity14 was deprived of due process because she had no consular access or access to legal documents in her language			1
he also says an attorney who represented her at one point did not represent her well			0
in july 2010 , a court ruled that the adoption was invalid , a ruling appealed by the @entity79 , who argue that they are the only parents the boy has really known			1
all seven of the court 's judges agreed to reverse the termination of @entity14 's parental rights , although some members thought the now 4 - year - old boy -- called @entity120 by his mother and @entity122 by the @entity79 -- should have been returned to @entity14			1
@entity123 addressed those concerns in a footnote to her opinion			0
" every member of this court agrees that this case is a travesty in its egregious procedural errors , its long duration , and its impact on @entity28 , @entity41 , and , most importantly , @entity134 , " she wrote			1
" the dissenting members of this court rely significantly on information outside the record to find that @entity28 has been victimized repeatedly and that her rights have been violated			2
the dissenting members believe passionately that custody of child should be returned to @entity28 without further proceedings			0
that result can be reached only by disregarding the law			0
" the federal government intends to deport @entity14 to @entity5 , where her other two children live , but has delayed the proceedings until this case is complete			0
@entity0 's @entity149 contributed to this report			0

@entity152 was in prison when her son was put up for adoption
@entity86 's supreme court sends the case back for a retrial
the state failed to comply " with the investigation and reporting requirements , " the court says
