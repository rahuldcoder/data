-- while @entity5 banking 's reputation was tarnished in the wake of the global economic crisis , @entity2 finance is being touted by some as a more ethical alternative , with the potential to appeal to customers beyond its @entity13 base			1
what sets @entity2 finance apart from other models is that it complies with @entity19 moral and religious law , including not charging or paying interest			1
and with more than 700 @entity2 financial institutions around the world , the sector is already worth up to $ 1.3 trillion globally			1
@entity0 's @entity24 sat down with @entity25 , @entity26 specialist and partner at @entity28 , to discuss what @entity2 finance really is and where it is growing			1
@entity0 : how would you describe @entity2 finance ? @entity25 : @entity2 finance is an alternative form of finance			1
it is something that is trying to cater to a particular segment of the population , in this case the @entity13 segment , because they are ethically constrained from participating in the conventional banking industry			1
but the aim is to try and offer to this segment as much as possible of what is available in the conventional sphere -- so in terms of your regular financial services and products , but overlaying that with certain rules which are derived from the @entity2 jurisprudence			2
and the chief among these rules will obviously be the prohibition of charging and paying interest			0
@entity0 : i imagine those who 're trying to offer these products are trying to explain that they 're not just @entity2 , they 're just different			2
ah : absolutely -- i think that 's the way they are being pitched , and you know , 20 years ago , yes it was very exotic , but i think these days they 're much more a feature of the global financial industry			0
@entity0 : do you think we will see an exponential growth in this ? ah : certainly where i sit i can see @entity2 finance moving into newer markets			1
it 's coming out of its sort of traditional dominion in the @entity72 and @entity73 and moving into places like @entity75 , @entity76 , and also @entity77 to some extent			2
@entity0 : is it going to be a slow growth ? what would be your projection ? ah : you have to look at a number of factors behind what drives growth in these markets			0
@entity88 , obviously , is the population			0
i think the second factor is that there are political issues around what 's happening in those markets			0
there 's uncertainty ; we 've all seen what 's happening in @entity99			0
it 's places like @entity102 and @entity103 -- a significant population in both countries , and particularly in the case of @entity103 , a case of instability in the last 10 to 20 years			1
if that ever gets resolved , who knows ? that could be a very fertile land for growth			0
and there 's obviously @entity114 in the middle , which is not an @entity2 country but again has a huge @entity13 population , which is a potential growth area			1
@entity0 : @entity73 and @entity118 are obvious places , and i know it 's growing , but i wonder if there 's a lot of untapped potential there as well ? ah : @entity73 is very well established			1
i think that 's a very mature market and they are one of , i would say , the pioneers of this industry			0
so there does n't seem to be that much further room to grow in @entity73			0
but @entity118 is largely untapped			2
i mean , the @entity118 government is moving in that direction			2
they have passed some legislation , i understand , to try and facilitate @entity2 banking			0
and some of the @entity73 clients that i work with , the @entity73 banks , they see @entity118 as the last frontier for them to expand their operations and grow .			0

@entity2 finance is @entity19 compliant and does n't charge or pay interest
population growth in @entity13 countries has meant a boost in @entity2 finance
@entity75 , @entity103 , @entity102 and @entity118 are potential growth areas
