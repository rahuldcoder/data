the recent and ghastly botched execution of a man in @entity2 has rekindled my thoughts on capital punishment -- a practice outlawed in most civilized countries			1
indeed , most of the industrialized world looks with horror on the @entity11 , in this regard , as a primitive and backward country			1
just in passing fact , capital punishment was banned in the @entity15 in 1870 , in @entity16 in 1877 , in @entity17 in 1910			0
in allowing the death penalty , the @entity11 stands with @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , among our other peers			1
it 's a sad commentary on justice in this country that , in a nation so plagued by capital murder , we should make it a state practice as well			2
do we not see the connection ? you would guess that a nation obsessed with guns and violence -- just read the papers -- might at some point notice that when the state participates in this brutality , there is a tacit agreement that the most complete response to provocation is death			1
two of the greatest writers of the19th century , @entity46 and @entity48 , passionately opposed the death penalty			1
both were also @entity51 , and they understood perfectly well that the @entity52 makes it clear that , under the old dispensation , an @entity53 was appropriate			0
but @entity56 said bluntly that not only should we never kill anyone , but we must turn the other cheek , resisting evil in a nonviolent way			0
this was n't something @entity56 imagined was up for grabs			0
@entity46 , the @entity64 of the novel , argued against capital punishment on many grounds , but he was especially concerned about the matter of determining guilt in such an absolute way			1
can we ever really know for sure that someone did something ? the death sentence is inevitably delivered by " men of fallible judgment , whose powers of arriving at the truth are limited , and in whom there is the capacity of a mistake or false judgment			2
" @entity48 wrote a stirring essay in 1908 called " @entity83 " in which he described a multiple hanging , and found it repulsive on every level			1
he noted the priest who attended the execution and how he mumbled something about @entity91 and @entity92 to the condemned			2
after a vivid account of the hanging , he says with an ironic twang : " all this is carefully arranged and planned by learned and enlightened people			0
" he notes that the government who commits this killing is involved in the process " from the lowest hangman to the highest official -- all support religion and @entity104 , which is altogether incompatible with the deed they commit			0
it has always struck me as bizarre that many of those who object most strenuously to abortion because it involves taking a life will quite happily condone capital punishment , as if this is somehow not taking a life			1
does it make it less immoral for the individual , in its collective guise as " the state , " to kill someone ? killing is killing , and when you give this ugly deed an official name -- capital punishment -- it 's still killing , and is grotesque for a supposedly humane nation to condone such a practice			2
as if we needed reminding , our @entity130 bans punishments that are deemed " cruel and unusual			0
" in the eyes of the civilized world , murder is cruel and unusual punishment , best left to vigilante outlaws , the criminally insane and rogue states			0
state - sponsored murder fosters a culture of violence that permeates our society , creating a punitive state of mind that does nobody any good			1
and it has surely proven ineffective in preventing further killings			0
indeed , it generates them .			0

@entity150 : botched @entity2 execution reminder that few civilized countries do this
he says state - sponsored killing fosters a culture of violence in @entity11
@entity150 : @entity46 , @entity48 found death penalty repulsive , *hypocritical* , *unchristian*
@entity150 : odd that many who oppose abortion are ok with the state taking a human life
