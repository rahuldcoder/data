-- eagles may be thin on the ground for most golfers at the @entity5 course at @entity6			1
but up in the treetops , it 's a different matter			0
bald eagles @entity10 and @entity11 have been par for the course at the @entity14 club for the past three and a half years , scoring highly with both local and global audiences thanks to a camera installed by their nest in a pine tree behind the 10th green			1
" the eagles came in and started building a nest in december 2010 , " explains golf course superintendent @entity21			1
" the first year they had two eaglets and both fledged successfully			1
we were just watching them from the ground not really knowing what was going on until about mid-may when two black heads popped up out of the nest			0
" the discovery prompted @entity21 to install an @entity34 which has been live since early 2012			1
this year , the pair -- who were given their names by @entity21 's daughter -- welcomed two more eaglets who go by the more functional names of @entity42 and @entity43			1
bald eagles were once on the @entity46 endangered species list , but numbers of the nation 's symbol have risen since the government banned the pesticide ddt -- which contaminated the birds ' food sources			1
the wingspans of the female eagles , which are larger than the males , can be up to eight feet			1
" @entity14 has had some good success with its eagle population , but this is the only one on a golf course that i know of			1
we are trying to show that golf courses can be a sustainable habitat for wildlife , " @entity21 told @entity0 ahead of @entity61 -- an initiative started in 1970 aimed at improving the world 's environment , and marked globally this year on april 22			2
@entity5 's round - the - clock live feed has received almost a million views to date			2
the virtual presence has also helped business at the club			2
" i 've been in the pro shop several times and people come in and ask which hole @entity34 is on , " @entity21 says			1
" we 've definitely had a considerable amount of play off it			0
" the project is one of many environmentally - minded measures @entity21 and his colleagues have tended to in recent years			0
" it 's not just about how we mow the grass or what fertilizer we 're putting down			0
we have an education center which has environmental information , awards and pictures of the course , " he says			1
@entity21 , who also writes about environmental improvements on a blog and gives talks , was recently recognized for his green leadership			1
last november , @entity98 awarded the course its @entity100 and in february @entity21 was crowned overall winner of the @entity102 in @entity103 for 2013			0
the prestigious prize , which is open to golf courses around the world , is jointly run by the @entity107 and @entity98			2
historically , golf courses have n't attracted praise for their green credentials but rather criticism , often being held up as examples of resource profligacy for over-watering and widespread use of chemicals			2
but this view may now be outdated says @entity117 , curators professor of biological sciences at the @entity119			0
" golf courses are aware of some of these negative things and actually they have done a very good job over the last 10 - 20 years of trying to improve environmental practices , " says @entity117 , who recently led a study on the effects of golf course development on salamander populations in the southern @entity124			1
" we studied 10 golf courses interviewing golf superintendents and managers			2
these were young , highly educated people -- many had degrees in biology , turf science or wildlife management			0
" they are well aware of these problems and very excited and very willing to make changes and use environmentally sound practices			0
" @entity21 says things have shifted " 180 degrees " since 2001 when he started at @entity5 , a @entity145 - designed course -- noting that the club has substantially reduced mowing , fertilizer use and water consumption			0
" we 've removed over 50 acres of highly maintained earth in the last decade			0
when you figure that out from a water standpoint , we save 7.39 million gallons annually			0
" as individuals and organizations around the globe mark @entity61 , it 's good to know that people like @entity21 are keeping an eagle eye on the environment not just today but all - year - round			0
