-- a series of spooky lights above parts of the northeastern @entity4 saturday sparked a flurry of phone calls to authorities and television news stations			0
@entity9 said strange lights seen in the @entity11 on saturday were caused by an experimental rocket			1
@entity0 affiliate stations from @entity14 to @entity15 heard from dozens of callers who reported that the lights appeared as a cone shape shining down from the sky			2
however , the lights were the result of an experimental rocket launch by @entity9 from the agency 's @entity25 in @entity27 , a spokesman told @entity0			2
@entity28 said the @entity29 was launched to study the @entity31 's highest clouds			1
the light came from an artificial noctilucent cloud formed by the exhaust particles of the rocket 's fourth stage about 173 miles high			1
natural noctilucent clouds , also called " polar mesospheric clouds , " are " found in the upper atmosphere as spectacular displays that are most easily seen just after sunset , " according to a @entity9 statement published earlier in september			2
" the clouds are the highest clouds in @entity31 's atmosphere , located in the mesosphere around 50 miles altitude			1
" normally , noctilucent clouds are not visible to the naked eye and can only be seen when illuminated by sunlight below the horizon			0
the launch took place at 7:46 p.m. saturday , just as the sun was setting for the day			0
observation stations on the ground and in satellites will track the artificial noctilucent clouds created by the rocket for months , @entity9 said			0
" data collected during the experiment will provide insight into the formation , evolution , and properties of noctilucent clouds , which are typically observed naturally at high latitudes			0
" in addition to the understanding of noctilucent clouds , scientists will use the experiment to validate and develop simulation models that predict the distribution of dust particles from rocket motors in the upper atmosphere , " the @entity9 statement said			1
