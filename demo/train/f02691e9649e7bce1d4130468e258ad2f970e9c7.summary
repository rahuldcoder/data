-- you would think that president @entity3 's surprise trip to @entity4 yesterday and speech to the troops would have quieted -- at least for one night -- the latest installment of the @entity9 's " @entity8			1
" while most of the president 's critics were silent or praised him for the trip , others did n't disappoint in following along with the fad			2
faux anger : it 's all the rage			1
the president 's speech honored and thanked our troops , reviewed our strength and resolve in @entity4 and in killing @entity23 -- who planned the 9/11 tragedy in that country -- and also in getting rid of 20 of 30 of @entity28 's top lieutenants			1
it provided a slight break in the action from the @entity9 temper tantrum that began earlier this week			1
that one was over the @entity3 campaign 's ad , which had the audacity in using the president 's decision to move forward on the raid to bring down @entity23 , no doubt a tremendous accomplishment for the administration and the country			1
the ad appalled @entity9 critics because we all know the @entity9 would never have " gone there			2
" oh wait , they would and they have			0
do we remember 9/11 ? with president @entity50 holding the megaphone , standing atop the rubble of ground zero ? with caskets draped in the @entity56 flag ? these were not postcards being sold on the street corners of @entity60 to commemorate the event that changed our lives forever			0
these were images of president @entity50 's 2004 campaign ads. back then of course , @entity66 cried foul , and @entity9 stood their ground			2
the difference now is that @entity66 have taken a page right out of the @entity9 playbook , using strength on foreign policy to remind people of the courageous decision @entity3 -- a @entity76 -- made , ordering the raid on the bin laden compound in @entity79 ( more on that later )			1
the @entity9 do n't much like being shown up on what has historically been their turf			0
as i say to my children whenever they throw a temper tantrum : tough noogies			0
those who worked for sen. @entity90 in 2004 and saw their candidate get bloodied by @entity50 and allies have even harsher words			0
if the tables were turned , does anyone think @entity9 would n't have used this accomplishment ? no. does anyone think that if -- @entity101 forbid -- the mission had gone sour , @entity3 's opponents would not have used it as the no. 1 reason to get him out of office ? no. this is exactly what happened to @entity108 and why it is so bizarre that @entity110 actually brought up @entity108 in his response when asked if he would have ordered the mission to kill @entity23			1
we know @entity108 would have , because he did order a difficult mission like this before			0
unfortunately , @entity116 failed , as did @entity108 's presidency because of it			0
what we do n't know is whether @entity110 would have ordered the @entity23 raid			1
according to @entity110 in 2008 , he actually would n't have done so under the exact same circumstances that president @entity3 said he would and in fact did			1
let 's remember that after the @entity50 administration went into @entity126 looking for @entity23 and did n't find him , the search took a back seat to going into @entity128 and getting @entity129			2
@entity50 actually de-prioritized the search for @entity23			0
and this became the line that many @entity9 candidates would follow in the 2008 campaign			0
before then , in 2007 , @entity110 had said he would not move @entity135 to find @entity23			1
he did clarify his statements a couple days later and also in a debate , saying that getting @entity23 was important , but so was focusing on other top tier @entity28 leaders			0
but the more damning statement came afterward , when he strongly criticized then - sen. @entity3 for saying he would go into @entity79 to get @entity23 without the help of the @entity79 if he had actionable intelligence to do so			1
@entity110 called those statements " ill - timed " and " ill - considered			0
" @entity110 needs to learn that words matter			2
when he says in no uncertain terms that he would not in fact order a mission in @entity79 without the knowledge of the @entity79 , and then criticizes his opponent for saying he would , why should we not judge him on exactly those words ? so mr. @entity110 , if you would like to now take back those words and concede you were wrong , you should do so			2
but do n't expect the @entity56 people to buy into your faux anger when your opponent is questioning how you would have acted when you yourself have provided the words that lead to that legitimate doubt			1
additionally , the @entity110 campaign and mr. @entity110 himself is saying any president would have made the same decision president @entity3 did			1
defense secretary @entity164 has said he thought it was " gutsy " and one of the most courageous calls he has seen a president make			0
the intelligence available at the time was 50 - 50 at best that @entity23 was even in that compound			0
vice president @entity172 said he had advised against it and that in fact the only person in that room that told the president to go was then @entity180 director @entity179			0
so in the infamous words of the @entity9 's beloved @entity182 : spare me the pious baloney			1
or at least the faux anger -- even if it is politics ' newest fashion craze			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity189 .			0

@entity189 : some in @entity9 have criticized @entity3 's @entity4 trip this week
she says @entity9 using faux anger , same as earlier criticism of @entity3 's @entity23 ad
she says @entity110 had said killing @entity23 not a priority ; he should own his words now
@entity189 : @entity9 *hypocritical* ; would *gladly* claim credit if its candidate had killed @entity23
