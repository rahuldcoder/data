whenever there is an uprising among the people of this country in the form of protests and organized dissent , especially with a presidential election 13 months away , the discussion inevitably shifts to what it will mean for one of the nation 's two political parties			1
no matter how hard they 've tried to suggest that they are n't partisan , the tea party is nothing more than a sub-group of the @entity17			1
if there were a healthy number of tea party @entity21 , then that would be true			1
but there is n't , so it 's nonsensical to waste time not calling the tea party @entity17 exactly what they are : tea party @entity17			1
from @entity27 the movement aligned itself with the @entity17 , and that is true today			1
yet the attempt by @entity30 , conservative radio show hosts and the @entity17 presidential candidates to associate @entity34 protesters with the image of far - left radical hippies being in lockstep with the @entity21 is wrong , shameful and pure intellectual dishonesty			1
being concerned about the nation 's well - being , and the depths to which the big - monied interests are driving the nation 's policies is not a partisan question ; it is a moral one			2
@entity17 presidential candidate wants to cheapen the discussion by suggesting @entity34 protesters hate capitalism			1
i sense they despise a nation that has come to be one in which @entity55 companies and big banks run ads talking about how great @entity59 is , but work hard to destroy @entity59 by shipping jobs overseas and engaging in shameful business practices that require the taxpayer to bail them out			2
it 's really simple , and insanely stupid , to examine the real anger of @entity34 as a bunch of young folks with nothing to do			2
if we recall march 2009 when the @entity73 bonuses came to light , every corner of this nation was angry with what we heard			2
political ideology did n't matter			1
it was seen as a matter of right and wrong			2
that 's why the various leaders of @entity34 , no matter how local and decentralized , must look at their effort as not being a galvanizing force to put one party into office			0
instead , it should be about candidates of both political parties , as well as independents , speaking to their needs and desires			1
this tea party vs. @entity34 construct is a ridiculous one			0
from a media perspective , it 's a cheap and easy narrative that , in the end , does n't tell the full story			1
as someone who is more enamored with studying the intricacies of the civil rights movement rather than memorizing key speeches of its leaders , what was clear from @entity27 was that it was n't about getting a @entity106 or @entity17 elected			1
it was always about ensuring full freedom and equality for @entity110 who were denied their rights as citizens			2
at different points , @entity17 and @entity21 were allies of the civil rights movement , while at the same time some @entity17 and @entity21 were virulent opponents			1
it was n't about party for civil rights leaders ; it was about principle			1
and that is exactly where we sit today			0
as i listen to the @entity34 protesters and watch as their protest spread across the country , similar to the lunch counter sit - ins that spread like wildfire across the @entity131 in 1960 , the goals and ideals sound eerily familiar			2
while in the 1960s it was about race , the civil rights battlefront today is about class			1
it is about the widening gap between the rich and poor , and how the middle class is being pushed down to the poor , rather than being helped upward			0
this struggle is the moral dilemma the rev. @entity141 frequently discussed			0
if folks would stop focusing on the last part of his " @entity147 " speech and read all of what he said at the @entity150 on aug. 28 , 1963 , they would understand that			0
so what if @entity152 , @entity153 and other celebrities have millions and are showing support for @entity34 ? when @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and other celebrities attended the 1963 march , no one said how dare those individuals with big bank accounts stood in solidarity with those with no bank accounts			0
when it comes to fairness , your values matter more than your tax bracket			0
if labor unions and politicians want to stand in solidarity with @entity34 , that is a good thing			0
if individuals who work on or used to work on @entity181 want to show their support for the need to systemic changes to this system , more power to them			0
if self - identified @entity21 and @entity17 want to show their moral outrage , praise @entity188			1
moral movements are n't supposed to be poisoned by politics			2
when they do , that 's when their legitimacy is lost			0
if politicians want to use their voices in support , they should			0
but at no time should occupy @entity181 be about getting one party elected to local , county , state and national office			0
the time has come for men and women of conscience in this nation to stand up			0
it 's vital that we elected individuals , regardless of party , who choose not to be an incestuous relationship with the rich in this country who are only about fattening their bottom lines while ignoring the plight of others			0
as dr. @entity141 said : " an individual has not started living until he can rise above the narrow confines of his individualistic concerns to the broader concerns of all humanity			0

@entity227 : saying protesters are in lockstep with @entity21 is intellectual dishonesty
candidates of both political parties should peaking to their desires , @entity227 says
@entity227 : the civil rights movement was n't about electing candidates ; neither is this one
