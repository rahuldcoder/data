-- the @entity2 health care system needs to be overhauled because of unresponsive leadership and a " corrosive culture " that affects the delivery of medical care , said a report delivered friday to president @entity8			1
" it is clear that there are significant and chronic systemic failures that must be addressed by the leadership at @entity2 , " said the report prepared by @entity10 , who is @entity8 's deputy chief of staff and who the president dispatched to assess the situation at the troubled agency			1
the @entity2 , a massive bureaucracy with more than 300,000 full - time employees , is under fire over allegations of alarming shortcomings at its medical facilities			1
the controversy , as @entity0 first reported , involves delayed care with potentially fatal consequences in possibly dozens of cases			0
nabors and acting va secretary @entity30 met with @entity8 to discuss the findings			1
excessive waiting periods at the @entity2 medical center in @entity36 , for example , a preliminary report made public last month indicated that at least 1,700 military veterans waiting to see a doctor were never scheduled for an appointment and were never placed on a wait list			1
@entity0 has reported that in @entity36 , the @entity2 used fraudulent record - keeping -- including an alleged secret list -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans , some of whom died in the process			1
but the problems go well beyond @entity36			0
dozens of others of @entity2 centers , all around the country , also face a host of allegations like possible abuse of scheduling practices			1
the report mentioned the inspector general is now investigating 77 va facilities , more than were previously reported			2
' corrosive culture ' hurts morale the report issued friday stressed that the vast majority of employees are dedicated and hard - working			0
yet , it cited a " corrosive culture " that created personnel problems across the department and hurt morale and , by extension , timeliness of medical care			0
when problems occur , they are transferred to other departments minimized or not acknowledged at all , the report said , and the culture " encourages discontent and backlash against employees			0
" " the department must take swift and appropriate accountability actions , " the report said			0
" there must be a recognition of how true accountability works			0
" lack of transparency cited the report called for an overhaul of leadership at the @entity89			0
" it currently acts with little transparency or accountability with regard to its management of the @entity2 medical structure , " the report said			1
the @entity2 central office could solve this problem with more transparency and by taking a more hands - on approach with regional leaders , the report said			1
other key findings of the report : -- the 14 - day scheduling standard for a medical appointment is " arbitrary , ill - defined , and misunderstood			2
" the goal was deemed unrealistic and " is a poor indicator of either patient satisfaction or quality of care " and should be replaced			0
-- the technology behind the basic scheduling system is " cumbersome and outdated			0
" -- additional resources , including doctors , nurses , trained support staff and other health professionals , are needed			0
-- many of the resource issues facing the @entity2 are similar to what exists in the private sector			2
but the @entity2 has not clearly articulated its funding needs			2
the @entity2 health system is the nation 's largest , with more than 1,700 sites serving 8.76 million people annually			1
the scandal has already created political waves			0
@entity130 resigned in may as the head of the @entity2			2
@entity8 has requested an appropriation of $ 163.9 billion for the department in the 2015 budget , a 6.5 % increase over the 2014 budget			2
@entity138 rep. @entity137 of @entity139 , chairman of the @entity140 , said , " it appears the @entity142 has finally come to terms with the serious and systemic @entity2 health care problems we 've been investigating and documenting for years			1
