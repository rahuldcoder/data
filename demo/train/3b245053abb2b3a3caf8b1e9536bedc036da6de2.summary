-- at dinnertime the other evening i walked into a seafood restaurant in a small strip mall off @entity4 41 in southwestern @entity5			0
the @entity6 © cor was faithful to an under - the - ocean theme , right down to bubbling water behind portholes built into one wall			0
along a corridor , on the door to the men 's room , was a framed photograph of a young , smiling @entity15			1
you could n't look at it without grinning			0
even if you had never set eyes on him in your life , you would know in a glance that this guy was some sort of star			0
the business he was in -- the movie - star business -- has always been built on instant visceral reaction			0
you 've got star quality , or you do n't			0
with @entity15 , there was never a question			1
i bring this up because sunday is @entity15 ' birthday			1
he is turning -- believe it or not -- 96			2
he is the last man standing of all the great name - above - the - title stars of @entity40 's so - called @entity39			1
@entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 -- all of them , except him , gone			0
i knew exactly why that photograph of @entity15 was on the door to the men 's room in the submarine - themed restaurant			1
one of @entity15 ' most unforgettable movies was 1954 's " @entity52 , " adapted from the @entity54 saga			1
@entity15 played the swashbuckling seafarer @entity55			1
from the archives : @entity15 , 92 , takes stock of his life it was the first favorite movie of my life			1
i must have seen it at least six times in the big palace of a downtown theater in our @entity66 hometown			0
i kept making my parents take me			0
the whole movie was thrilling , but one scene topped them all : @entity15 , in a red - and - white - striped t - shirt , a guitar in his hands , sang a song called " @entity78 " to his shipmates : " got a whale of a tale to tell you , lads			1
. " no textbooks are needed to define what constitutes star quality			0
that one bit of film contains all the information necessary			0
about 25 years ago , i saw in the paper that " @entity52 " was scheduled to be broadcast in prime time on @entity91			1
this was in the @entity95 , @entity94 era ; if a wonderful old movie was going to be aired , your one shot at seeing it was at the whim and convenience of a network			0
i eagerly awaited -- especially for the chance to see and hear @entity15 sing " @entity78 " one more time			1
i watched the movie -- every minute of it			2
no " whale of a tale			0
" they had cut it out , for time reasons			2
" i could n't believe they 'd done it			0
the next morning , i remembered that i knew someone who knew someone who claimed to know @entity15			1
i made a few phone calls , and was given a @entity117 number that i was told was @entity15 ' business office			1
i called , expecting to leave a message			2
and @entity15 picked up the phone			1
i asked him if he 'd heard about how the movie had been edited			0
" i rarely watch my own films , " he said			0
" they 're for other people , not for me			0
" i told him that " @entity78 " had been taken out of the tv version			1
" that 's a sacrilege , " he said			2
" i had no idea they 'd done that			0
if they ca n't use ' @entity78 , ' then they should n't run the picture at all			0
" i could barely concentrate on what he was saying , because it was hard enough processing the fact that i was talking with @entity15			1
" it was really a rollicking song that everyone liked , " he said			2
" ' @entity52 ' holds a very special place in my heart , because it was the movie that made me a star to young kids			1
in my earlier movies i had played rather rough characters -- characters that kids probably should n't have seen			2
but when i played @entity55 in ' @entity52 , ' all of a sudden i had a whole new audience			1
" from the archives : @entity15 deals frankly with stroke , depression and then , in the middle of our conversation , without prompting , he did something that will stay with me forever			1
he started to sing " @entity78 " over the telephone : " got a whale of a tale to tell you lads , a whale of a tale or two			0
" the sound of that voice , across all the years			0
the magic of a movie star : "			0
' bout the flapping fish and the girls i 've loved , on nights like this with the moon above , a whale of a tale and it 's all true , i swear by my tattoo			2
" being 96 is often not much fun for those who make it to that age , and @entity15 has battled health problems in recent years			1
the last of those legends with the special something that turns out to be eternal			2
all those indelible roles , in " @entity183 " and " @entity184 " and " @entity185 " and " @entity186 " and " @entity187 " and " @entity188 "			0
. when @entity15 started making pictures , @entity189 was still acting in movies			1
@entity15 ' son @entity192 has already had a long and full movie career			1
i stood in that restaurant and looked at him grinning off the painted door , the wattage of the smile above his cleft chin undimmed			0
what a life for @entity15 , as he was named by his parents on december 9 , 1916 , in @entity202 , @entity203 -- what a life for the self - described ragman 's son who decided he would be @entity15 , and see where that might take him			1
a whale of a tale , and it 's all true			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity213			2

@entity213 says @entity15 is @entity40 's last remaining @entity39 idol
in " @entity52 , " he played a seafarer and sang a memorable song
@entity213 watched a tv version in which song was cut ; he called @entity221 , who was *appalled*
@entity213 : @entity15 turns 96 today , has come far from his early @entity224 days as @entity15
