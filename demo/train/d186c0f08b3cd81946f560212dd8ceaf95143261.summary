-- not too long ago , the @entity2 stage belonged to @entity3			1
in flowing robes and wraparound sunglasses , he crisscrossed the continent in flashy caravans as throngs of supporters waved and cheered from the roadsides			1
fellow @entity2 leaders bestowed upon him endearing nicknames : " brother leader , " " king of kings of @entity15			1
" and @entity16 was among the @entity18 's largest contributors , paying dues for some of the 54 member nations			1
but @entity3 's regime now sits in ruins , leaving @entity15 without a major investor who disbursed billions of dollars for roads , mosques and luxury hotels			1
" he was known for handing out large sums of cash			1
wherever he thinks he can buy friendship , he hands out large sums of cash , " said @entity31 , executive director of the @entity32 , a @entity33 - based group that aims to foster a better understanding of the continent			1
" his investments bought him loyalty			1
it 's a very @entity2 thing to do : ' he helped us , so let 's help him ' " in @entity46 , which has given refuge to his son , @entity48 , the ousted leader 's influence is evident			1
a gleaming mosque built by the @entity16 government in the 1970s stands tall in the capital of @entity52			1
thousands attend prayers at the mosque -- a valuable gift to the poor @entity58 country where crowds pack into limited worship spaces			2
next door in @entity62 , @entity3 funded the construction of a popular mosque in the capital @entity66 , and helped pay for a @entity62 government complex that 's under construction			2
@entity3 also poured money into neighboring @entity70 and @entity71 as well			2
such investments sealed @entity3 's clout in @entity15			2
it came as no surprise that some leaders were initially reluctant to endorse the new @entity16 interim government , analysts say			1
" whoever ... builds infrastructure , provides cheap products for markets and loans to support government initiatives will always have an influence over @entity15 affairs , " said @entity79 , director of @entity80 , an organization that sells content about @entity15 to media outlets internationally			2
another reason many in the continent backed @entity3 was self - preservation , analysts say			1
" some @entity2 leaders think that if they do n't support @entity3 now , next time round it could be them and who will take them in ? " @entity79 said			1
" this move guarantees some protection should there be an uprising in their countries ... they can count on each other			2
" for their part , some continent leaders say they did not rush to recognize the new @entity16 leadership because the international community overstepped its boundaries			1
@entity2 president @entity111 , who joined the @entity18 in recognizing the new leadership last month , said @entity114 's military intervention in @entity16 undermined efforts by the pan-african body to find peaceful solutions for member states			1
in @entity15 , @entity3 's influence extended beyond his generosity			2
his ideas and eccentricity were also a big draw , analysts say			2
during his term as chairman of the @entity18 in 2009 , he renewed his calls for a " @entity128 " that would use a single passport , a single military and a single currency			1
he had proposed a similar concept for @entity134 unity , but was rebuffed			2
" the @entity134 world did not like him , and he had no choice because they were not as easy to push around , " said @entity135 , a professor of @entity2 politics at @entity137			1
" he turned to @entity15 ... they had a lot of struggling nations " so , while some @entity15 leaders considered @entity3 's vision of a unified @entity15 unrealistic , they nevertheless hailed it as one advocating pan-african cooperation			1
" he sang the liberation song very well , and a lot of people connected with that because that still strikes a chord , " @entity31 said			2
also propelling @entity3 's popularity in the region : his anti-western tirades			2
" both @entity3 and @entity159 's @entity158 dare to stand up against the @entity160 ... they are seen as @entity15 bad boys and wear their medals with pride , " @entity79 said			0
" he who stands up and shouts the most is usually revered			0
" @entity79 described @entity3 as " the rogue school bully " who , despite the fact that his actions may not be condoned , commands respect for challenging the status quo			0
and there were plenty of @entity3 investments that were condemnable , analysts say			0
his support of brutal dictators , such as former strongman @entity176 of @entity177 , helped intensify the bloodshed in the region , @entity31 said			0
@entity176 , who led @entity177 from 1997 to 2003 , is accused of fueling a bloody civil war in his nation and neighboring @entity182 that led to widespread murder , rape and mutilation			0
@entity3 is also accused of helping arm @entity134 militias in @entity191 's violence - wracked @entity189 region			0
and he backed rebel groups in several countries including the @entity194 in @entity62 and @entity46 , who were responsible for violence in the 1990s			0
the new @entity16 government has said it believes the @entity194 tribe is currently protecting the fallen leader			1
" @entity3 supported a lot of @entity202 revolutions that led to a lot of bloodshed and civil wars , " @entity31 said			0
" he funded and helped create those revolutions			0
" during @entity16 's civil war , the gambit paid off			0
as rebel forces advanced , seizing town after town , @entity3 called in fighters from @entity214 nations for backup , analysts say			0
some fighters are from countries " beholden to him " and those fleeing the grinding poverty in their homelands , @entity135 said			0
on the other hand , @entity3 also financially supported the @entity222 in its fight to end apartheid in @entity2 , according to @entity31			1
" even while he was funding rebels , he was also funding liberation movements			0
we can not take that from him , " @entity31 said			0
this dichotomy makes @entity3 's legacy in the continent a tricky one , analysts say			1
" whoever writes the final chapter will have a difficult balancing act with a man who has a complex schizophrenic relationship with the world , " @entity79 said			0
" love him or hate him			0
madman or god ? " so what awaits @entity15 now that @entity3 is no longer in power ? " there are two big elephants in the room , " said @entity243 , director of @entity244 , a global firm that works with companies looking to invest in @entity15			0
will @entity3 's absence lead to gaps in infrastructure investment in some of the countries ? and if so , how will those countries cope ? " according to the @entity255 , the infrastructure funding gap in @entity15 is approximately $ 31 billion per year			0
it also appears that @entity3 has invested in some of the poorest and most fragile regions in @entity15 , " @entity243 said			0
in the long run , the international community may have to step in to fill the gaps , he said			0
but for now , the ripple effects are already reverberating			0
in @entity46 , long a recipient of @entity3 's largesse , a road funded by the ousted leader lies unfinished			1
@entity0 's @entity266 contributed to this report from @entity52 , @entity46			0

some @entity2 leaders bestowed endearing nicknames on him
they included " brother leader " and " @entity275 "
the *toppled* ruler was among the largest contributors to the @entity18
he disbursed billions of dollars for mosques , roads and luxury hotels in the continent
