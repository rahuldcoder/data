-- through some highly successful crowdfunding and skillful negotiation , the last remaining laboratory of futurist inventor @entity4 is now in the hands of a nonprofit group that wants to preserve the site and make it a museum honoring " the father of the electric age			1
" the @entity12 announced that it 's completed the purchase of the building and land of @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , after trying for more than 18 years			1
the original asking price was $ 1.6 million , but the deal closed for $ 850,000			0
last year , the nonprofit made a plea on the internet for donors			0
@entity4 fan @entity25 , creator of the web cartoon " @entity25 , " started an @entity30 crowdfunding effort irreverently titled " @entity12			1
" fans of @entity4 's responded , raising more than $ 1 million in about a week before wrapping up with $ 1.37 million			1
the @entity16 was to be where @entity4 realized his dream of developing wireless communications and clean , free energy for the world			2
it was never completed , and the building was later used by a photo processing company , leaving the area tainted with chemicals			0
the money left over after the purchase will be used to clean up and renovate the property			0
the ultimate goal , an interactive science museum honoring @entity4 , will require much more cash			1
" now begin the next important steps in raising the money needed to restore the historic laboratory , " @entity49 , treasurer of the @entity12 , said in a statement			0
" we estimate that we will need to raise about $ 10 million to create a science learning center and museum worthy of @entity4 and his legacy			1
we invite everyone who believes in science education and in recognizing @entity4 for his many contributions to society to join in helping to make this dream a reality			2
" on his website , @entity64 thanked donors and said an event is planned this summer in @entity17 to help finance the science center			2
musical performances , lectures , interactive exhibits and tours -- with @entity64 as one of the guides -- are planned during the two - day event			2
@entity64 also plans a special @entity4 demonstration during the event			1
" i own a fully functional @entity4 coil cannon and i plan to bbq some sriracha - bacon sandwiches by shooting them with its 20,000 volt electric arc , so the event will be both scientific and delicious , " @entity64 wrote on his site			1
" again , we 're shooting for this summer but we have n't pinned down a date yet			0
" the @entity12 is also calling on volunteers to come out saturday to assist in the cleanup along the perimeter of the site			0
interested people can sign up using @entity90 , which is helping organize the event			0
largely forgotten for decades in the shadows of inventors like @entity94 , @entity4 has emerged in recent years as a sort of unsung hero among the science - minded			1
@entity4 foresaw the need for wireless transmissions in the late 1800s -- a hundred years before anyone picked up a cell phone			2
but @entity4 's work lost much of its financial backing after inventor @entity104 sent radio signals across the @entity106 , and the lab site was lost in 1915			1
now , the nonprofit group hopes to soon be welcoming visitors who can understand and appreciate all the accomplishments and ideas envisioned by the inventor			1
" this is a major milestone in our almost two - decade effort to save this historically and scientifically significant site			0
we have been pursuing this dream with confidence that we would eventually succeed , " said @entity119 , vice president of the @entity12			0
" we are very excited to be able to finally set foot on the grounds where @entity4 walked and worked			0
" more information about fundraising events and the @entity16 site can be found on the @entity12 website , @entity129 page and @entity131 feed .			0
