-- endurance swimmer and record - holder @entity1 arrived in @entity4 tuesday morning , but not in the manner she hoped			1
the 61 - year - old arrived in @entity7 aboard a boat , hours after abandoning a 103 - mile swim from @entity10 to @entity4 at about the halfway point			1
she had attempted to become the first person to swim between @entity10 and @entity4 without a shark cage , but ocean swells , shoulder pain and asthma forced her to give up the swim			1
@entity1 was vomiting when she was brought aboard a boat at 12:45 a.m. tuesday -- 29 hours after she jumped into the water sunday			1
" i would be lying to say i 'm not deeply , deeply disappointed , " she told @entity0			0
" this was a big dream , not just of the last two years but some 30 years ago when i tried it			0
" " the swim was in me , " she said , but the conditions were not on her side			1
after all of the work and effort that her supporters and followers invested in the last two years in preparation for the swim , @entity1 said it was unlikely that she would attempt the @entity10 to @entity4 swim again			1
after much consideration , @entity1 made the decision to call off the swim and was quickly taken aboard the @entity36 , the 75 - foot yacht that carried her handlers , drivers , photographers , as well as friends and family			1
once on the boat , under her own power , @entity1 worked her way up the stairs and into a waiting chair , overwhelmed with exhaustion and emotion			1
she was given intravenous fluids as she battled nausea			0
some three hours later , she rose to her feet and walked inside the boat			1
there , lying down , she talked to those on board , a mini-press conference of sorts with half a dozen cameras at work			0
@entity1 said that as early as the third hour of her journey she began experiencing pain in her right shoulder			1
by hour 15 , asthma was a problem			2
as hour 28 approached , the pain was so great that she had to rest every 30 to 40 freestyle strokes , rolling onto her back to breathe			2
her doctor , @entity69 , would swim to her on breaks to monitor vitals or administer medication			2
" i 'm hurting , i 'm hurting , " @entity1 told him , clutching her shoulder and looking to the stars			1
then , she 'd turn back into the water , struggling through another stroke or two , pushing and pushing and pushing			0
by hour 29 , she was weighing the math between belabored strokes			0
she asked : " do i have to swim all night and all day and all night again ? " the answer was yes			1
@entity1 switched to a breast stroke , a last hope to find a way to propel herself to land			1
and , finally , she made the decision			0
" asthma took so much out of me , " she told @entity0 chief medical correspondent @entity90			2
" i could n't overcome it			0
" @entity1 said she took at least 40 inhaler puffs and even took oxygen to help improve her breathing			1
" we did everything we could to get out of asthma distress , but i could n't have gone another hour , could n't have done it , " she said			2
" i really believed willpower would get me through , but the asthma really shafted me , " she added			2
she willed herself to go as far as she did , and was willing to doggy - paddle to the end if necessary , she told @entity0			2
after the seas kicked up and she was ailing , however , she knew mental toughness alone would not be enough			0
" i just knew it was n't mind over matter anymore			0
i was absolutely spent , " she said			0
after her rigorous training -- which included a 24 - hour swim for practice , ending her swim was " a bitter pill to swallow , " @entity1 said			1
it was an end to a journey that started off looking much brighter			0
" earlier in the evening , she was surrounded by dolphins and a beautiful @entity116 sunset			0
but strong currents blew her 15 miles off course , " her team posted on her @entity119 account			0
the attempt to swim from @entity10 to @entity4 was the second for the swimmer , who said at a news conference sunday that she is fitter today than she was in 1978 , when she first attempted the crossing but was unable to finish			1
it took several months to gain permission for the swim from @entity10 and @entity131 authorities			2
bureaucratic snags repeatedly threatened to call off the effort -- already called off in 2010 because of weather			0
" to swim between these two neighbors , @entity10 and the @entity131 , who 've been strangers all these years , is a moving thing for me , " @entity1 had said			1
she had been training for the event for two years , swimming up to 12 hours a day			2
a team of more than 30 people supported @entity1 as she attempted the crossing			1
she had 10 handlers to advise her as she swam , ocean kayakers towing devices to repel most sharks and divers and safety officers trained to distract sharks that were not turned away			0
the lesson that others can take away from her journey is to be your best self , she said			0
" you have to live your life with passion , you show your will , you feel proud of yourself when you go to bed at night , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity158 contributed to this report .			0
