-- so there he was , sitting on the queen 's bed , wearing a soiled t - shirt and jeans , holding a broken ashtray and bleeding from a cut on his hand : a man named @entity12 , who was 31 at the time , had climbed a wall of @entity14 , crawled through an open window and made his way to the bedroom of @entity18 , who was sleeping			1
when she awakened to find the guy sitting there staring at her , it is fair to surmise that she was not pleased			0
especially when @entity12 asked her if she had a spare cigarette			0
this happened on july 9 , 1982 , generating international headlines , and only because the queen survived unharmed does it read like a comedy of errors			1
the errors were plentiful , including the queen 's repeated attempts to summon help , at first to no avail			1
but now , 30 years later , during the celebration of the @entity37 in @entity38 this week , it is instructive to recall the monarch 's rude awakening by the bleeding intruder who was in search of a smoke			1
we assume that the handful of people at the absolute pinnacle of life -- the queen being the lead example -- have the means and the staffs and the security teams to insulate themselves from indignities that mere mortals have to put up with			1
analysis : why @entity18 's jubilee celebrations matter to @entity58 and , most of the time , they do			2
but when there are breaches of presumed privacy , boy , does it cause a commotion			2
follow @entity0 's live jubilee blog we do n't have to go back in history to look for instances of this			2
just consider what pope @entity72 is thinking right now in the wake of the news that his butler , @entity76 , has been arrested , accused of having the pope 's confidential documents in his home			1
the investigation is still playing out in @entity81 , but if the allegations prove true and it turns out that @entity76 , one of the few people who had access to the pope 's living quarters , including the pope 's desk , lifted the information , then the pope will know with certainty that even with his rarified position , he ca n't count on personal privacy behind the guarded walls of the @entity94			2
in the @entity101 , president @entity100 , after an assassination attempt on a @entity97 sidewalk in the second month of his first term , was assured that efforts would be redoubled to make certain no one who wished to hurt him would be able to get that close again			1
@entity105 was said to be especially adamant that her husband be kept out of harm 's way			2
so it was almost beyond belief one afternoon in april 1992 when @entity100 , out of office but still being protected by the @entity111 , was in @entity112 to receive an award and was accosted right onstage			1
@entity100 had just been given the award -- a 2 - foot - high crystal statue of an eagle -- when a man named @entity118 , 41 , walked through the ring of security around the former president and onto the stage , grabbed the crystal eagle , smashed it forcefully to the floor ( with @entity100 being struck by the flying glass ) , and commandeered the microphone			1
@entity100 was hustled offstage by the @entity111 , and @entity118 , too , was hauled away			1
but there was widespread incredulity that someone could get past all the federal , local and private security that is always on hand for an appearance by a president or former president			2
some breaches are more comical than frightening			2
@entity137 was famously kept away from the gazes and grasping hands of his admirers when he was not performing			0
his privacy at home was especially important to him			0
but his old friends and employees sometimes tell the story of what happened when a crate arrived at his home with ventilation holes punched into it			0
the delivery service said that fans had sent him , as a gift , a top - pedigree dog			0
so , according to the story , the crate was carted into the house , and was opened			0
out climbed two young women			0
they were escorted off the property			0
the persistence of those who infringe upon the privacy of the exalted can be astonishing			0
it turned out that @entity12 , the queen 's uninvited visitor , had managed to sneak into @entity14 a month earlier and had helped himself to a bottle of wine			1
for that he was charged with theft -- but was not charged criminally for the subsequent trespass that took him to her sleeping quarters , because at the time it was considered a civil violation			0
and @entity176 , sent to prison for a failed assassination attempt on president @entity179 in 1975 , wrote to him while she was incarcerated -- a letter described as " strange " by @entity179			0
she was able to reach the president once he had left office -- the letter made it to his home , and he read it -- even while she was locked away from society			1
the oddity of these encounters that happen when the personal space of the most protected people on the planet is violated -- the bizarreness of the moments when they are reminded that nothing in life is guaranteed -- can be both mesmerizing and haunting			1
just ask @entity18 , in the unlikely event you ever get close enough			0
but you probably should n't ask her for a cigarette .			0

@entity202 : in 1982 a man got past everyone at @entity14 into the queen 's bedroom
it made headlines , showing that even the protective *bubble* of the exalted is not *airtight*
other breaches -- the @entity215 's butler , @entity100 's stage *crasher* -- show this , he says
@entity202 : bizarre *incursions* are mesmerizing and show life has no guarantees
