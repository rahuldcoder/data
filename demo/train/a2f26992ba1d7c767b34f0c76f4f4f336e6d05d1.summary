in the process , she had to succeed where others had tried and failed in the face of an entrenched monopoly : @entity26			0
" people thought it was not possible to break the monopoly of the existing company that was there , because it has been there for 80 years , " says @entity8 , who launched her company 's first beer product , called @entity29 , in 2008			1
" people thought it was normal for us to have only one company in this country , " she adds			0

for the next 10 years she came up against big names in @entity13 's wine industry , but in 2007 , taxes imposed on alcohol manufacturing made it difficult to keep prices low			1
@entity8 says the hikes made her product too expensive for her target customers , forcing her to stop producing fortified wine			2

" before the end of this year we laid a foundation stone of expanding the brewery to ten-fold of whatever we have now , " she says			0
" the support of the @entity13 has kept me going all this time because i think that without their support it would have been very hard for anybody to continue doing the business , " adds @entity8			1

" a model for aspiring young entrepreneurs across @entity13 , @entity8 's business skills and efforts to liberalize the country 's industry were recognized in 2010 with an award from the president of @entity13			1
