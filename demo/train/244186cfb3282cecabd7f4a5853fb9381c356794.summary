@entity0 says he 's unsure if he will play at this month 's @entity2 after slumping to defeat in the opening round of the @entity4 in @entity5			1
the world @entity6 was dumped out of the season opener by 34 - year - old @entity10 qualifier @entity9 1 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 in a match lasting a little under two hours			1
@entity0 , who defeated @entity12 in the final 12 months ago , admitted to being nervous in his first tour match since undergoing appendix surgery last november			1
" i was playing with more nerves than usual			0
i knew that winning a couple of matches here will help me , so that makes me play a little bit more under more tension , " @entity0 said , the @entity17 website reported			0
his second defeat inside a week -- @entity0 lost in straight sets to @entity26 at an exhibition tournament in @entity28 on january 3 -- has cast doubt in his own mind if he is ready for the season 's opening grand slam in @entity33 which gets underway on january 19			2
" this is the third comeback of my career after injury , so we will see how it goes in a couple of months			2
i wanted to start well , but it was not the case today , " @entity0 said , @entity40 reported			0
" i also want to play in the @entity2 which is a tournament i like a lot			1
i do n't know if that will be the case either , but i am going to work for it			0
if not i will be playing at @entity48 and @entity49 ( @entity17 clay court tournaments taking place in february )			0
" the season is long			0
after coming back from injury you ca n't see the immediate moment , you have to look further ahead a little bit			2
" after suffering a back injury in last year 's @entity2 final defeat to @entity59 @entity58 , and missing the @entity60 in september with a wrist injury , @entity0 could be forgiven for being cautious about his return			1
tsonga out of @entity33 while @entity0 's participation remains in doubt , @entity64 will definitely not be in the draw for @entity33			2
the 29 - year - old @entity68 , who reached the final in 2008 , has yet to recover from an arm injury sustained during @entity68 's defeat to @entity72 in the @entity74 final last november			1
" it is with great disappointment that i have to postpone today the start of my season , pulling out of the @entity2 , " @entity64 said wednesday			1
" i 'm still suffering from a forearm inflammation ( intersection syndrome ) and that prevents me from being at full capacity			0
" there seem to be no such health worries for world no. 1 @entity85 who was forced to withdraw from last weekend 's final against @entity26 in @entity28 with a fever			0
the @entity88 cruised through his opening match in @entity5 , seeing off his compatriot @entity91 6 - 2 6 - 1 in 59 minutes			1
