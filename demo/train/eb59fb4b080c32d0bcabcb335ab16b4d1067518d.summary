-- the apprentice became the master as the wheels stopped turning in the 100th @entity4 on a balmy @entity5 evening			1
the man they called " super domestique " for his selfless service in helping sir @entity10 to the 2012 crown is now top dog			1
@entity13 won the world 's greatest cycling road race sunday to become the second successive @entity16 to win the @entity4			1
the 28 - year - old , runner - up in 2012 , had pulled on the yellow jersey for the first time after the eighth stage of the 21 - leg epic and from then on was never really challenged			2
@entity13 , who won three stages , finished four minutes and 20 seconds ahead of the field			1
fellow climber @entity26 @entity25 -- a future prospect at just 23 years old -- finished as @entity28 and second overall			1
@entity31 's @entity30 took the final place on the podium , finishing third ahead of @entity31 stalwart @entity35			2
for the second year running , @entity37 @entity36 claimed the green jersey			0
the 23 - year - old led the sprint category for 38 out of the 41 days he has raced in the @entity4			1
a twilight finale saw the peloton parade past some famous @entity5 landmarks , including the royal palace of @entity45 and the @entity47 museum , before a 10 - lap loop of the @entity49 came down to an intense sprint that was won by @entity52 @entity51 ahead of @entity53 and @entity54			2
@entity13 finished the day - night stage in 114th place but after the glitzy centennial celebrations fizzled out he stood alone , shaking his head in disbelief , under the @entity60 as the @entity4 champion			1
" i 'd like to dedicate this win to my late mother who without her encouragement to follow my dream i 'd probably be watching this event on the television , " @entity13 said on the podium			2
" to win the 100th edition is an honor beyond any dream			0
this is one yellow jersey that will stand the test of time			0
" @entity13 certainly learned valuable lessons supporting @entity77 in last year 's tour but his raw talent was forged cycling in the rural highlands of @entity82 , where he was born			1
@entity82 cycling champion @entity83 was @entity13 's first mentor -- long before @entity85 maestro sir @entity84 began to shape his career			1
" he was just funny and happy , a white boy who accepted our village and ate our food , " @entity83 recalled on @entity88 radio station 5 live			0
" he would want to complete each and every training ride and he would n't stop			0
if he decided he wanted to complete the whole 100km he would do exactly that			0
" no matter how much pain or how many hours he went through he would keep riding to the end			0
" @entity84 has also credited @entity13 's steely ambition to his battle with bilharzia -- a parasitic disease which he contracted during his childhood in @entity104			1
@entity13 himself struggled to describe his feelings as he reflected on his route to success			2
" for me , what this represents -- the journey i 've taken to get here from where i started , riding on a little mountain bike back on dirt roads in @entity82 , " he told reporters in @entity110			0
" to be right here , the yellow jersey at the @entity4 , the biggest event on our cycling calendar ... it 's difficult for me to put into words			1
" the @entity4 may have finished in glory and glitter under @entity5 lights but the world 's most famous cycle race is still ridden in the shadow of @entity130 's dubious legacy			1
the @entity131 was stripped of his seven @entity4 titles after admitting earlier this year to persistent use of banned substances during his halcyon days of domination			2
it was almost inevitable that some of @entity13 's performances raised eyebrows during his ride to victory			1
in this year 's first mountain stage , the @entity16 won the energy - sapping 195 - kilometer ( 121 - mile ) ride from @entity143 to ax 3 @entity144 51 seconds ahead of his closest rival			1
there was another dominant performance from the 28 - year - old as he conquered the gruelling @entity149 -- at 150 miles the longest stage of the @entity4 -- just days later			2
@entity13 had to be given oxygen after his arduous efforts but his obvious fatigue did not stop questions being asked			0
in an attempt to end the finger - pointing surrounding @entity13 , @entity85 gave @entity110 newspaper @entity157 data of 18 of his climbs since he made his major breakthrough in 2011			1
the @entity110 newspaper 's sports science expert , @entity161 , was satisfied the results were consistent with doping - free riding			0
commenting on the spectre of doping on broadcaster @entity166 @entity13 said : " on the back of the history of the sport and recent revelations whoever was wearing the yellow jersey was going to come under a lot of scrutiny			0
" i hope i 've shown the sport has changed and we as the peloton wo n't stand for it any longer			0
" @entity77 , who pulled out of this year 's tour because of a knee condition , told @entity0 that cycling 's troubled history is now most useful when it is used in a light and shade comparison to where the sport was -- and where it is heading			0
" it 's had a tainted history but i think all that is a reminder of where the sport was and where it is now , " he said			0
" and it 's in a great position			0
" and after emerging from shadows of his own , @entity13 will agree the future is bright .			0
