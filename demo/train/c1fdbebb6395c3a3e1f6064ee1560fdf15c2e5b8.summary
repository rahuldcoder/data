-- the suicide bombing in @entity2 is a reminder to counterterrorism agencies that it 's not just jihadist groups who threaten @entity9 governments and their interests overseas			2
pockets of the extreme left and extreme right still consider political violence legitimate -- among them the @entity17 's @entity16 in @entity18			1
@entity18 authorities have blamed the @entity22 @entity21 attack on the group , better known as @entity24 , and are in the process of identifying the bomber			1
analysts say it is likely the attack had two aims -- to embarrass the @entity18 government and to demonstrate the group 's hostility to the deployment of @entity36 anti-missile batteries on @entity18 soil			1
several members of the group are thought to be close to the @entity41 regime			0
@entity43 terror group claims responsibility for @entity22 @entity21 bombing @entity24 has a relationship with the @entity18 @entity48 separatist group @entity47 , which is also close to the @entity41 government			1
about one - third of the @entity47 's fighters are said to be @entity41 , according to regional analysts			0
@entity24 is viscerally hostile to the @entity18 state , the @entity22 and @entity53 , and has had links with the far - left in @entity55			1
in recent days , @entity18 police have arrested several dozen people suspected of links with @entity24 , among them a number of lawyers			1
however , @entity62 called the arrests an " arbitrary and abusive use of anti-terrorism laws in @entity18			2
" @entity18 authorities believe the suicide bomber friday was @entity68 , a longtime member of the group			1
dna tests are being conducted to confirm his identity			0
@entity68 received bomb - making training somewhere in @entity55 in the mid- 1990s , according to @entity73 , a security expert at the @entity75 in @entity76			2
@entity18 officials say that as a result of counterterrorism operations on @entity18 soil , @entity24 became increasingly active among the @entity18 diaspora in @entity55			1
@entity68 returned to @entity18 in 1997 and was subsequently involved in attacks on the @entity84 police headquarters and senior military officials using anti-tank weapons			2
after being arrested , @entity68 went on a lengthy hunger strike and was released from jail in 2002 because of a neurological disorder			0
a @entity91 dynamic in @entity18 attack @entity24 has been active for more than 30 years and espouses a @entity94 philosophy reminiscent of the @entity91			1
it grew out of another far - left group , @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , formed when @entity18 was in political turmoil , with clashes between militant left - and right - wing groups undermining a weak political system			1
@entity24 claimed responsibility for gun attacks that killed two @entity22 , including a @entity22 military employee , and an attack that wounded a @entity22 military officer in early 1991 in protest of the @entity105			1
among other attacks attributed to the @entity24 was the assassination of a former justice minister , @entity108 , in 1994 , as well as the murders of a number of senior police and military officials and , 1996 , a prominent businessman , @entity114			0
among its more recent operations was an attempt to kill another former justice minister , @entity118 , in 2009			0
the female suicide bomber 's main explosive charge did not go off			0
security analysts say the latest attack is very similar to one launched on an @entity84 police station last year			0
again , a former hunger striker who was critically sick with cancer arrived at the police station wearing a belt stuffed with explosives and triggered the bomb just before passing through an x-ray machine			0
@entity130 told @entity0 he is unaware of any links between @entity24 and @entity133 - type actors , but the possibility ca n't be entirely dismissed because @entity133 sympathizers have become increasingly active in the region			2
the @entity138 assessment of the group says , " @entity22 , @entity55 and @entity141 companies and enterprises are also among the targets of @entity24 since they are considered by the terrorist organization as assets of global imperialism			2
" it says the group is also involved in drug trafficking to finance its operations			0
analysts consulted by @entity0 do not believe the organization has the capacity to launch a sustained terrorist campaign , nor penetrate security at well - guarded installations			0
its last known attack aimed at a @entity22 target in @entity18 was in 1999 , when two men tried to fire a rocket at the @entity22 consulate general building in @entity84			1
both were killed in a subsequent firefight .			0
