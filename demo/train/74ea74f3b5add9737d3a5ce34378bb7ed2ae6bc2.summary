-- the head of world soccer @entity2 has again been caught up in controversy -- but this time it was all the fault of a fake @entity6 president			1
@entity2 's @entity8 account was hacked on monday as was @entity6 's official account for the @entity10 in @entity11			1
as well saying he was stepping down as @entity6 president , the bogus tweets referred to @entity2 and @entity15 's winning 2022 @entity10 bid			1
" some @entity6 accounts , including @ @entity19 and @ fifaworldcup , have been hacked , " said @entity6 in a statement			1
a group calling themselves the @entity22 -- said to be supportive of the country 's leader @entity23 -- claimed responsibility for hacking the accounts			2
" this sort of attack is about getting a point across , " @entity27 , security strategist at software and security firm @entity29 , told @entity0			0
" @entity33 comes back to manipulation			0
some groups do it to gain money and some of them to do it to get a point across			0
there are different motivating factors			0
" last month , the @entity22 hacked into several of @entity45 broadcaster the @entity43 's accounts			1
prior to the hacking of @entity2 , another @entity8 account emerged -- @ @entity48 -- which threatened to disclose confidential @entity6 documents , though it was quickly deleted or suspended			1
it is unclear whether the account was genuine or a hoax			2
" at no time did an account with this name come up in any discussions with @entity8 , " a @entity6 spokesman told @entity0			1
other high - profile victims of hacking include @entity60 and @entity61 , whose @entity8 accounts were both hijacked in february			1
@entity8 's own systems were hacked earlier this year , with attackers gaining access to usernames as well as encrypted and randomized passwords for about 250,000 users			1
" as we are online so much more now , i 'd expect to see more high - profile attacks , " added @entity69			2
" it 's not a reason to panic but a reason to take a step back and think how we should protect ourselves online			2
" i spend most of my time trying to encourage companies to make information security a priority			0
people used to see it as an it problem -- but now they see it as a business problem			0
" the challenge for businesses now is how they manage the impact on their brand if they were to have an attack			0
" @entity2 may have been targeted because he divides opinion , regularly attracting controversy over his leadership but also helping promote soccer across the globe			1
a series of corruption scandals within @entity6 , his botched re-election campaign -- where his only opponent was barred from standing after another corruption scandal -- and the failure of @entity102 's bid to host the 2018 @entity10 to attract any interest in @entity6 's corridors of power ( despite having the best technical report ) led to an outpouring of criticism of @entity2			1
however , his dedication to grassroots football and the game 's growth in @entity114 , the @entity108 and @entity109 are widely regarded as positives of his presidency			2
when @entity2 joined the federation , 146 countries were members			2
now , there are 209 member nations , earning @entity6 the nickname the " @entity123 of football "			2
despite the embarrassment for @entity6 and @entity2 , security expert @entity69 urged him to continue tweeting			1
password panic " open attacks are most often down to the users themselves , " @entity69 explained			0
" strong passwords are crucial to prevent hacking			0
" i ask friends five questions and if any of the answers they give me are part of their passwords then they have failed the test			0
" the questions are spouse 's name , significant birthdays , favorite sporting team , siblings and pet 's name			2
many a dog has died and lived on in a password			0
" the key is not panicking			0
there 's no need to stay off social media or the internet -- it 's about thinking about the dangers			0
" secure your password , do n't use social media on free public wifi , do n't let people see what you 're typing -- and do n't say something on social media which you would n't be prepared to shout out at in a public space			0
" a @entity8 spokesman was not immediately available for comment on the hacking of the @entity2 and @entity6 's accounts			1
@entity6 president since 1998 , the 77 - year - old @entity2 has not yet announced whether he will be standing for a fifth term when his current term ends in 2015			1
but if he does , he may want to set a new password first .			0
