-- with its iconic @entity2 and world - famous @entity3 , @entity1 is easily @entity5 's most recognizable city			1
it 's also a hot property market			0
the country 's low interest and mortgage rates have driven sales of affordable middle income housing in recent years			0
but with demand so high there is barely enough stock to satisfy hungry homebuyers			0
now one company believes they have the solution that will both save space and keep city living cost effective -- shipping containers			1
from its base in the town of @entity24 , @entity21 is transforming the durable metal boxes into comfy homes that will eventually be transported to locations across @entity5			1
according to @entity29 , the company 's ceo , the concept provides a clean and productive way to provide affordable urban housing			2
shipping containers as homes have already appeared in various guises in the likes of the @entity36 , the @entity37 , @entity38 , the @entity39 and @entity40			1
" i started the business because i thought there was a need for affordable housing and a cleaner and greener option , " @entity29 said			0
" i 'd seen ( containers being used ) overseas and i think it 's something that needs to be done and i 'm doing it			2
" so far , business for @entity29 has been brisk			0
annual turnover last year was over $ 1.5 million dollars and the company expects to double that going forward			2
from $ 565 per square meter ( $ 52 per sq ft ) to $ 1,400 per square meter ( $ 130 per sq ft ) , the cost of construction and overall sale price is lower than a brick building			1
according to @entity29 , there are environmental and construction advantages as well			1
" the ecological advantages of building with a container is the recycling of a container ... we try to use as many eco-friendly products as possible including solar composting toilets , " he said			1
" there 's virtually no on - site work to build it so there is less use of tradesmen going to site and there 's a lot of savings for the client like scaffolding , safety fences , portaloos all that stuff that you need to construct on site			0
" given the time saved by excluding these processes , a house can be built from scratch in as little as three weeks			0
windows are cut out , containers are welded together and stacked on top of each other to provide multiple floors and rooms while insulation panels are installed to contain heat			2
clients can also personalize the design to give their new abode a bespoke feel			0
many still doubt whether people will want to live in recycled steel boxes , but with more than 34 million shipping containers either in use or lying dormant around the world , an increasing number of architects are aware of the possibilities they provide .			1
