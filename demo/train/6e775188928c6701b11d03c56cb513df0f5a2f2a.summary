@entity2 @entity1 's most vocal critics have long tried to tie the former secretary of state to president @entity5 , hoping that her 2016 run would be dragged down by the somewhat unpopular president			1
but ahead of tuesday 's @entity10 address , critics say @entity11 is making their job easy			0
@entity13 , the executive director of @entity14 , an anti-clinton communications and research super @entity15 , argues in talking points to other @entity19 that @entity11 is tying herself to @entity5 by working with and hiring many of his staffers ahead of her all - but - certain 2016 run			1
" by hiring his key political and policy staff and making no public moves to place clear distance between herself and the president on issues likely to be front and center in the coming @entity33 , @entity11 is signaling that she 's not just from the same party as the president , but that she 's an @entity5 @entity36 , who will back his policies , pursue his agenda , and represent a third term of the @entity40 , " @entity13 argues in a memo to the group 's supporters			1
since last year , @entity11 has been meeting with a broad array of @entity43 operatives and possible campaign staffers ahead of a possible 2016 run			1
but in the last month , @entity11 has reportedly began to tap certain @entity43 operatives -- many with ties to @entity5 's two successful presidential runs -- for certain jobs on her nascent campaign			1
@entity52 , a top aide on the @entity5 @entity53 , has said a number of times that he plans to leave the @entity53 in early february and would happily work for @entity11 is she runs			2
" if she runs , as i hope she will , i will do whatever she asks me to do , " @entity52 , who previously worked as chief of staff to former president @entity11 , said on the @entity58 in november			0
" right now she has n't made a decision to run , so i am expecting to return to what i was doing before			0
" @entity43 widely expect -- and other outlets have reported -- that @entity64 will serve as @entity11 's campaign chairman , should she run			2
in the memo , @entity13 argues that @entity52 's inclusion on team @entity11 is the biggest sign of her joining with @entity5			2
" he [ @entity52 ] will bring that same policy agenda , willingness to subvert @entity33 and rhetoric to @entity74 , " he writes			0
what 's more , @entity11 has reportedly selected pollsters @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 and media adviser @entity80 for top roles in the campaign			2
all have worked in similar capacities for either the president 's 2008 or 2012 campaigns			2
@entity11 allies have long expressed concern that one of the most effective critiques could be that her presidency , should she run and be elected , would be nothing more than president @entity5 's third term			1
but @entity11 allies have become more upbeat about being tied to @entity5 in the last few months given improved economic indicators			0
@entity94 , spokeswoman for @entity95 , a @entity15 , said @entity13 's energy behind the @entity11 memo could have been dedicated at another possible 2016 candidate			0
" @entity14 , â € ‹ the @entity109 where @entity13 works , is essentially a @entity100 organization founded by staffers from @entity102 's failed 2012 presidential campaign			0
they would serve themselves better to focus on their growing @entity102 shadow campaign for their party 's nomination			0
" republicans have been closely watching for @entity11 to break with @entity5 on certain issues , while at the same time labeling her 2016 run as " @entity5 's @entity114			1
" " beyond @entity11 's issues agenda , her campaign 's political leadership is shaping up to be staffed not by her own former campaign advisers , but rely heavily on president @entity5 's 2012 campaign leadership , " @entity13 writes			1
" put bluntly : the state of the @entity5 - @entity123 is strong			0

a key @entity19 *attack* on a would - be @entity1 presidential run would be that she *'d* be @entity5 's third term
@entity11 has been talking with a number of high *profile* @entity43 operatives while considering a presidential run
@entity11 has also reportedly hired advisers from @entity5 's 2008 and 2012 runs for top jobs in her campaign
