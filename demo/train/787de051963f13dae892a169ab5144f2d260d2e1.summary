-- @entity1 was precisely as we had remembered him			1
provocative , outspoken , manipulative , supremely confident , and utterly compelling			0
the only thing lacking in the @entity5 's first campaign back in charge at @entity7 was the usual glut of trophies			1
but if you listened to the former @entity13 and @entity14 coach opine on the @entity17 title race last season , his side was never in the running			1
despite managing a club owned by @entity21 , who is worth a reputed $ 10 billion , @entity1 decried his team as the " little horse " in the scurry for the finish line			1
this season , ominously , his tone is different			2
the acquisition of two big names from @entity30 -- @entity31 of @entity32 and @entity33 from @entity36 champion @entity34 -- has taken his squad onto a different plane , while the return of stalwart @entity40 adds an unashamedly sentimental sheen			1
" we have the squad that we want to have , " @entity1 told reporters on the eve of the new season			1
" it is a squad for tomorrow , for next season and also a squad with big possibilities for the next five or 10 years with so many young people			1
" @entity7 may have finished third last season , but @entity1 's tactical prowess was still in evidence			1
not only did he propel the @entity55 to home and away wins over eventual champion @entity57 , he did the same to @entity59 -- a morale - crushing 2 - 0 victory at @entity62 in late april was @entity63 for the @entity65 ' title aspirations			1
it was against the lesser lights @entity7 faltered , but with his squad now bolstered by yet more quality , @entity1 's charges wo n't be as generous this time around			1
verdict : surely , a third @entity17 title under @entity1 awaits			1
@entity57 champion twice in the past three seasons , @entity57 might have to play second fiddle to @entity1 and @entity7 in 2014 - 15			1
last season 's triumph was a mass of contradictions -- for large parts of the campaign big - spending @entity57 was considered favorite but became ultimately reliant on @entity59 's last - gasp stumble to claim top honors			1
@entity85 's charges spent just 15 days at the top over the whole campaign ; the irony of this season may well see it spend more time at the summit without finishing as top dog			2
the club 's @entity93 coach is a year older and wiser as to the travails of @entity97 football however , and it has lavished more cash on fleshing out a squad that already has more depth than an @entity102 swimming pool			2
@entity57 has raided @entity103 to prise @entity104 and @entity105 from @entity106 , while goalkeeper @entity107 and @entity108 have arrived from @entity30			2
that quartet 's lack of @entity97 experience has been offset to a degree by the arrival of two seasoned @entity17 campaigners plucked from @entity57 's rivals			1
@entity116 , a three - time title winner , has joined on loan from @entity57 's subsidiary club @entity119 after being released by @entity7 , while @entity121 defender @entity120 has signed from @entity122			1
as ever , @entity57 's success will hinge on its twin titans : midfielder @entity125 , who has resolved to stay at the club despite threatening to leave after he received a modest birthday present ; and prolific @entity129 striker @entity128 , who has signed a new five - year contract			1
verdict : close but no cigar as @entity57 settles for second best			2
@entity133 this is where the waters become muddied			2
can @entity137 transform @entity133 into a serious title contender by sheer force of personality alone ? the great @entity141 was able to , propelling his team to title success in his final season despite notable deficiencies in his squad			1
but those holes remain -- not filled by @entity148 in his disastrous sole season in charge -- even if june 's purchase of @entity152 from @entity153 in @entity30 will add some much - needed creativity in the middle of the park			2
promising @entity97 left - back @entity157 has also been added for what many believe to be a vastly inflated sum , but the 19 - year - old will miss the opening month through injury			2
for all its limitations , this is still a team that boasts a strike force as lethal as they come			0
@entity168 , newly installed as @entity170 's captain , needs 15 goals to move third on the @entity17 's all - time scorers list			1
and @entity174 's four goals at the @entity175 were crucial as @entity170 led @entity176 to third place in @entity178			0
there are no @entity181 distractions for @entity133 after last season 's malaise , finishing a lowly seventh , so the squad should stay fresh and hungry			1
whatever happens , it wo n't be dull with @entity170 around			0
verdict : an up - and - down season to end in third place			2
@entity122 the @entity188 have become masters of deception in recent years			0
promising @entity17 campaigns have frittered away and shots at silverware squandered			2
that is precisely what happened in the top flight last season			0
@entity122 spent 128 days atop the division in 2013 - 14 but suffered maulings at the hands of @entity7 and @entity59 as a familiar @entity202 slump took hold			1
a spike as spring emerged helped usher in @entity181 qualification for the 17th straight year but then came a watershed moment in may -- an @entity208 triumph			0
victory over @entity210 in @entity97 's premier knockout competition slaked a nine - year thirst for a trophy and eased the pressure on @entity215 that had been steadily mounting throughout that time			0
a change of direction that began with the marquee signing of @entity220 from @entity13 this time last year has continued , with Â £ 66 million ( $ 110m ) spent ahead of the new campaign			0
the purchase of @entity224 from @entity32 after his fine @entity175 with @entity225 has convinced many fans the @entity188 can stay in title contention as 2014 - 15 reaches its business end			1
in taking right - back @entity229 from @entity231 , @entity215 has replaced departing @entity232 @entity120 with an equally competent compatriot			0
@entity235 @entity175 star @entity234 represents competition for @entity237 in the race for the goalkeeper 's jersey and teenage defender @entity241 -- who cost a reported $ 25 million from @entity243 -- indulges @entity215 's " one for the future " passion			0
another couple of signings before the window shuts on september 1 could catapult the @entity250 side into the title reckoning , but a top - four finish should still be comfortable even without			2
verdict : a fast start before a predictable fade to fourth place for the third successive season			0
@entity59 how do you replace @entity258 ? the simple answer is you ca n't			0
the @entity261 's move to @entity32 may have engendered an $ 128.5 million windfall , but he takes with him wistful memories of a luxuriant season that reaped 31 goals and 12 assists			0
manager @entity268 has chosen to disseminate that cash liberally , rather than try to plug the gap with one marquee signing			0
that has one obvious advantage and one undeniable negative			0
eight new arrivals means @entity59 's options are now rich and plentiful but , as @entity278 found out so painfully when trying to replace @entity279 last season , it is rare they all hit the ground running			0
add to that a phalanx of extra games now that the @entity65 are in the @entity181 after an absence of four seasons , and repeating last year 's push for the title seems unrealistic			0
the likes of @entity290 and @entity291 , both plucked from @entity243 , have @entity17 and @entity175 experience while the likes of midfielder @entity294 and striker @entity295 have huge potential -- though the latter , who scored @entity300 's winner against @entity301 at @entity178 2014 , has been loaned back to @entity232 club @entity302			1
@entity268 ' renowned man - management skills will be tested as he and aging captain @entity305 attempt to bed the new arrivals into the @entity59 way			0
unless assimilation takes less time than expected , this season is destined to become one of transition for the @entity65			0
verdict : a fifth - place finish after a long winter of adjustment			0
