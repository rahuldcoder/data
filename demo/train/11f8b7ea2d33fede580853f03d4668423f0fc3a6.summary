-- @entity2 sci - fi fans are missing something			1
after roughly 20 years on television , the " @entity5 " franchise is defunct			2
the " @entity8 " franchise is still waiting to launch its latest iteration , " @entity13 , " and the resurrected " v " franchise , which ran on @entity11 , ended after two seasons			2
where are all the aliens on television ? this weekend , at least some aliens will be on @entity18 , as " @entity27 " premieres sunday at 9 p.m. et. @entity19 and @entity20 have been working on the show ( an apocalyptic science fiction show about an alien invasion that decimates @entity25 's societies ) for three years , and fans have been waiting			1
( @entity18 , like @entity0 , is owned by parent company @entity28			2
) the " @entity27 ' " preview at last year 's @entity30 sparked excitement from a packed room of fans , but series star @entity34 knows the stakes are high			1
" i was amazed at the turnout we got , " @entity34 said			2
" and just how closely that particular audience pays attention to detail			2
how wounded they feel ( after ) being jilted in the past ( by other science fiction shows ) and so they have an apprehension about embracing a new project			1
" but once that audience is won over , i do n't think there 's a more loyal following anywhere			2
they seem to be the most vociferous letter writers in the country to support shows they enjoy , and hopefully we 'll be one of them , " he said			1
sci - fi fans say they have been burned by @entity55 in the past and are cautious with their excitement for shows like " @entity27 " and @entity61 's upcoming " @entity60			1
" fledgling shows with ardent fan support have not been lucky in prime time in the last year			1
" it seems like if a show does n't come out of the gate blazing white hot and maintain that ' wow ' factor , they 're gone in two episodes , " sci - fi fan @entity65 said			2
@entity65 , who works in the it security industry , spent 13 hours getting a stargate tattooed around his elbow			0
" i feel like @entity2 networks do n't get it , " said @entity75 , an insurance agent in @entity77 , @entity78 , and an avid science fiction fan			1
citing @entity83 's recent pass on " @entity84 , " a supernatural show created by " @entity8 " alum @entity86 , which would have ostensibly been a cross between " @entity88 " and " @entity89 , " @entity75 said , " the networks are not catering to the people who want to see something intelligently written			0
i think they 're absolutely missing out and @entity93 and @entity94 get it			0
" in order to fill the programming void , plenty of fans who tuned in to long - established franchises are turning to " @entity101 " on @entity102 and " @entity103 , " " haven , " " sanctuary " and " @entity105 " on the @entity94 channel			1
" @entity27 " executive producer @entity107 knows what sci - fi fans have been missing and said it was a specific design of the show to get writers who could offer compelling stories			1
" we literally had writers from ' @entity8 , ' ' lost , ' ' heroes ' and for the second season , a writer from ' @entity5 , ' " @entity107 said			0
" we specifically went out there to pursue people who could tell those types of stories			0
but then we also wanted to make sure the people that were tuning in weekly who did n't know about the mythology because maybe they missed a week or two could still get on for the ride , " he said			0
@entity125 , a co-executive producer and writer for " @entity27 " is one of those people			1
he 's worked on " @entity8 , " " @entity127 " and " heroes			0
" " one of the big differences i think with ' @entity27 ' from many other invasion shows is that we 're actually starting six months after the main ' shock and awe ' invasion has happened			1
so our survivors have had six months for the shock to fade and now they 're faced with a series of choices			0
they 're essentially under occupation from this alien force , which is very strange , " @entity125 said			0
the aliens are mysterious , he said , because they are n't talking or negotiating with the captive @entity25 population			1
" these are n't the @entity143 , who look like us and we can talk to and try to talk our way out of it or negotiate or something			0
these creatures are very complicated and strange			0
" @entity34 admits the aliens seen in " @entity27 " are " really freaky			1
" " we did n't have the benefit of knowing what they were going to look like when we shot the pilot , " he said			0
instead , the actors reacted to an image of one of the giant spiders from the movie " @entity158 " that was blown up on a piece of cardboard and carried around by a prop guy			0
freaky aliens and end - of - the - world scenarios are often catnip to the sci - fi fan community , something executive producer @entity162 knows all too well			2
" @entity169 ( @entity20 ) spoke about from the beginning is , it should feel incredibly authentic and incredibly grounded in real human emotions			2
people should be able to posit the question , ' what would you do if you were in this scenario ? ' " he said			0
apocalyptic science fiction uses out - of - this - world circumstances to describe human struggle , @entity162 said the most interesting area for " @entity27 " creators to explore was the human character , he said			1
" everything in terms of how we judge people in society -- socioeconomically , education-wise , all those things -- they go away immediately given what 's happened here , " he said			0
it 's one reason why science fiction fans love the genre so much			1
stories that envision the future can focus on how society evolves and what fantastic technology could exist , like @entity201 's vision in " @entity202 , " but they can also show a more directly relatable side of future humanity			0
" everyone pulls together for the good of all mankind " in apocalyptic science fiction , said @entity75			1
" there 's a lot more pulling together in science fiction than really any other genre			1
" " and you do n't see that every day			0
with a tragedy you do , you see people pull together for a little while and it gives you hope that people do have that in them , " she said .			0

apocalyptic science fiction focuses on aliens and the human condition
fans wonder why science fiction shows seem to be first on the network *chopping* blocks
