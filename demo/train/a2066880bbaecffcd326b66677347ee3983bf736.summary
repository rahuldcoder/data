@entity1 @entity0 revealed his strategy for dealing with the polarizing foreign policy legacy of his brother : make a quick declaration of independence then pivot to a searing attack on the failings abroad of president @entity10			1
" i love my father and my brother			2
i admire their service to the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make , " @entity0 said wednesday in @entity14 during the first major foreign policy speech of his prospective @entity17 presidential campaign			1
" but i am my own man			0
" the appearance offered @entity0 a chance to show how he will balance a desire not to dismiss @entity27 's presidency while insulating himself from @entity29 attempts to paint him as a clone of the man who led the nation into a bloody , prolonged era of foreign wars			1
@entity0 did concede that the previous @entity0 administration made " a mistake " by not providing security for @entity37 in the wake of the @entity40 invasion in 2003			1
but he also argued that his brother 's surge strategy forged political stability in @entity37 that @entity10 squandered in his eagerness to get @entity40 troops home			1
it 's too early to tell whether @entity0 's appearance answered the key question facing his campaign : can a third man with the name " @entity0 " win the presidency in a nation exhausted by war and suspicious of dynasties ? but his message seemed clearly tailored towards the activist base of the @entity17 , which likes its foreign policy hawkish , and has significant doubts about @entity0 on issues including immigration reform and education which could hamper his chances of winning the primary race			1
@entity29 quickly tried to stamp out any progress @entity0 had made with the wider electorate which he would ask to entrust him with @entity40 national security if he becomes the @entity17 nominee			1
" today , @entity0 made his first foray into explaining and attempting to recast his foreign policy , " said @entity71 spokeswoman @entity70			1
" but despite @entity0 's claim that he will be his ' own man ' , there is little evidence that @entity0 's foreign policy agenda is much different than his brother 's			1
" she added : " embracing decisions that made the world more dangerous , and then trying to shift the blame -- that 's the @entity84			2
" @entity0 is not the first presidential candidate forced to differentiate himself from a powerful predecessor in a desire to strike out on his own			1
vice president @entity88 famously declared he was his " own man " as he tried to shuffle out of the shadow of @entity91 's impeachment shame in 2000			2
@entity10 jabbed @entity92 in 2008 over her famous husband 's intervention in the campaign , saying he could not sometimes tell who he was running against			2
she responded : " i 'm here			0
" @entity0 is a more cerebral , cautious character than his brother and his speech lacked the bristling rhetoric of @entity27 which @entity29 often decried as a symptom of cowboy diplomacy			1
but the hawkish global vision he laid out sat squarely in the muscular foreign policy that has dominated the @entity17 since his brother went on the offensive following the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks			2
@entity0 made a case that @entity10 was being misled by @entity108 on nuclear talks , said the president had been too soft on @entity111 , sided with @entity113 prime minister @entity112 in the row over his address to @entity116 and condemned the administration 's opening to @entity119			1
he said @entity10 's failure to do a deal to keep @entity40 troops in @entity37 created a " void " exploited by extremists			2
" this administration talks , but the words fade , " @entity0 said			1
" they draw red lines , and then erase them			0
with grandiosity they announce resets and then disengage			0
@entity133 campaigns replace actual diplomacy and engagement			0
" @entity0 offered few surprises			1
this was exactly the kind of speech a prospective @entity17 presidential candidate would be expected to make 21 months before a general election			2
@entity0 made a case that @entity10 's politics had tipped the world into chaos , played to the @entity17 's base and avoided unveiling new policies that could get ripped to shreds in the long months on the campaign trail			1
despite the inclusion on list of foreign policy advisors released by his camp of @entity17 gurus @entity154 and @entity155 , @entity0 had little in common with the subtle internationalism of his father @entity157			1
" the great irony of the @entity10 presidency is this , someone who came to office , promising greater engagement with the world has left @entity164 less influential in the world , " @entity0 said			1
" everywhere you look , you see the world slipping out of control , " @entity0 said , blaming @entity10 for the rise of @entity167 , the breakdown of @entity37 and @entity169 , @entity108 dominance of the @entity171 and and @entity111 's belligerence			1
" under this administration , we are inconsistent and indecisive			0
we have lost the trust and confidence of our friends			0
we definitely no longer inspire fear in our enemies , " @entity0 said , in a speech delivered at such a breakneck pace that he at one point confused @entity108 and @entity37			1
this was clearly an act of political positioning rather than an attempt to chart a meaningful foreign policy strategy			2
" we policy wonks like wonkish speeches and politicians like political speeches , " said @entity192 , head of the foreign policy program at the @entity194			0
" there was nothing very surprising about the speech			0
i think there would be nothing very surprising about president @entity0 's foreign policy			1
this was a do no harm speech			0
" @entity0 did little to deviate from @entity17 foreign policy orthodoxy			1
he said a strong economy was crucial to @entity40 national security , advocated increased military spending , rebuilt alliances with @entity214 members and in @entity215 and an effort to reengage with traditional @entity40 friends in the @entity171 like @entity218			0
while he repeatedly criticized @entity10 , he did not say if he would use military force against @entity108 if nuclear diplomacy failed or make a decisive intervention into the debate about whether to deploy ground troops to @entity169 to help fight @entity167			1
he did however advocate arming @entity224			0
it was the kind of speech that every single @entity17 running for president is likely to give during the campaign -- with the possible exception of the more isolationist @entity231			0
the goal seemed to be to show @entity0 could be trusted with national security but was not extreme			2
and it likely did little to scare off other possible @entity17 candidates -- especially someone like @entity238 sen. @entity237 , who is positioning himself as a foreign policy expert			0
" nobody is going to be running for eight more years of @entity10 foreign and defense policy , " said @entity240 of the conservative @entity241			0
" everybody is going to sound like they are not a neo-con and not an isolationist			0
this would check the box of what you would expect a responsible speech to sound like			0
" @entity0 argued that he had come by his foreign policy views in a grounding in global affairs that started when he lived overseas with his wife @entity257 in @entity258			2
as governor , he said , he led multiple trade missions to @entity164 and had visited @entity113 five times			0
he said he had " forced " himself to visit @entity215 four times a year to experience the region 's explosive growth -- and complained that people he met said @entity10 's @entity215 " pivot " policy was all talk and no action			0
he ended his speech with a message to @entity17 isolationists and @entity10 's foreign policy backers			2
" @entity164 does not have the luxury of withdrawing from the world , " @entity0 said			2
" our security , and our prosperity , and our values demand that we remain engaged and involved in -- often distant places , " he said			0
" we have no reason to apologize for our leadership , or our interest in serving the cause of global security , global peace , and human freedom			0
nothing and no one can replace strong @entity40 leadership			0
" @entity2 's @entity290 contributed to this report			0
