-- rep. @entity1 must be ruing his bad luck			0
the hearing he carefully orchestrated to pick at the scab of @entity5 was stepped on by the verdict in the @entity8 murder trial and by the story of three women held captive and brutalized for a decade in @entity11			1
he was out - sensationalized and out - tawdried this week despite his own best efforts and those of his committee colleagues and staff members			1
that is not to say that the tragic events that unfolded last year in @entity5 are not worthy of serious investigation			1
they just did n't get them from @entity1 's committee			2
as secretary of state @entity23 said in her passionate testimony in december , we need to know what went wrong to prevent future tragedies			0
that 's why she began an investigation immediately after the attacks			0
but @entity1 and his co-inquisitors were more interested in the arithmetic of 2016 presidential politics than with the events of last september 11 in @entity34			0
the testimony of @entity36 , the former @entity34 deputy chief of mission , was striking and at times moving , and offered useful additional perspectives			0
he said he had suffered negative repercussions because he challenged the @entity41 line on what happened in @entity5			2
but even while some of what he said was new and resonant , the @entity43 on the committee were n't listening			0
they focused less on learning what could have been done differently than on trying to establish that @entity48 and her closest associates had tried to cover up the tragedy			1
@entity52 : @entity5 investigation both legitimate and partisan on this point , very little was revealed that was either material or new			1
@entity36 said a @entity48 aide had been angry at him over how he conducted himself with investigators after the incident			2
he disputed the way the attack and its origins were depicted by senior officials on television			0
he deplored the losses that took place			0
but to say that any of this points at a cover - up " has all the elements of @entity69 - class fiction attached to it , " as former ambassador @entity71 , co-chairman of the committee that first investigated the attacks suggested			1
that @entity48 's team might want to have a clear sense of how what was clearly a politically motivated congressional investigation was being conducted seems only logical and responsible			1
that the origins of the attack were framed as related to an inflammatory amateur video that appeared on the @entity83 has long ago been established as wrong and misguided			0
that the losses were terrible and that @entity86 diplomatic outposts in dangerous places need more security is absolutely true , and if they really cared about such things , @entity1 and his team would devote more of their attention to reaching consensus on how to find the funding needed to ensure that security is available nothing spoken of in the hearing suggested a cover - up by a @entity99 secretary , who instantly took personal responsibility for the attacks and swiftly appointed an independent commission led by two of the most distinguished , nonpartisan career civil servants in recent @entity86 history to investigate them			1
to say otherwise is more than a reach			0
it 's an effort by the @entity43 to damage the person most likely to be the next @entity111 presidential candidate			0
in the calculus of @entity113 today , @entity48 is a bigger and more valuable target even than her former boss , the president			2
having said that , it is almost certainly the case that the reason the initial focus in these hearings was not on the @entity123 or elsewhere in the executive branch was that there was no evidence of a cover - up or of a politically spinning of the @entity129 message there either			1
indeed , even @entity43 sen. @entity130 said that having reviewed all the evidence he felt there was nothing new to be revealed by these latest hearings			1
no , this is just the latest example of the fine @entity113 art of promoting an enduring scandal out of not very much , demonstrating the ability of microphones in congressional hearings to turn scattered inconclusive facts and emotion into innuendo and blips in opinion polls			1
that the process also debases and , perversely , distracts from the very serious issues associated with protecting our diplomats and our interests overseas is hardly important , it seems , to the political attack dogs whose appetites are so insatiable that any nutrition - free scrap of half - truth looks like a meal			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity160 .			2

@entity160 : @entity5 hearing *upstaged* by @entity8 verdict , @entity11 story
he says @entity5 worth investigating , but committee 's aim was to *undermine* @entity48
he says little new revealed in hearing and no evidence of cover - up shown
@entity160 : hearings an attempt to turn innuendo into blips on opinion polls for 2016 race
