@entity0 -- a satellite whose orbit is degrading will fall back to @entity7 friday afternoon , but only some of its pieces will survive the fiery ride through the atmosphere , @entity3 scientists said thursday			1
the pieces are not expected to come down over @entity13 , scientists said , but where they 'll likely land is something @entity3 expects to narrow down over the next 24 hours			1
most of the @entity18 ( @entity18 ) is made of aluminum and will burn up on re-entry , @entity3 said			1
of the satellite 's 6 tons , only about half a ton of it will make it back to @entity7			1
the components that wo n't burn are made of stainless steel , titanium and beryllium			2
@entity3 has identified 26 pieces they expect to survive , ranging in size from around 10 pounds to hundreds of pounds			1
@entity31 of @entity3 's @entity33 team in @entity34 told @entity1 there 's no way to know exactly where those pieces will come down			1
" keep in mind , they wo n't be traveling at those high orbital velocities			2
as they hit the air they tend to slow down and travel , they 're still traveling fast a few tens to hundreds of miles per hour but no longer those tremendous orbital velocities , " he explained			2
because the satellite travels thousands of miles in a matter of minutes as it orbits -- even just before it hits the @entity7 's atmosphere -- it will be impossible to pinpoint the exact location the pieces will come down			1
on top of that , @entity31 said , the satellite is not stable			0
" part of the problem is the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it 's coming down even right before the re-entry			0
" because water covers 70 % of the @entity7 's surface , @entity3 believes that most , if not all of the surviving debris will land in water			1
even if pieces strike dry land , there 's very little risk any of it will hit people			1
however , in an abundance of caution , the @entity76 on thursday released an advisory warning pilots about the falling satellite , calling it a potential hazard			0
" it is critical that all pilots / flight crew members report any observed falling space debris to the appropriate ( air traffic control ) facility and include position , altitude , time and direction of debris observed , " the @entity76 statement said			0
the @entity76 said warnings of this sort typically are sent out to pilots concerning specific hazards they may encounter during flights such as air shows , rocket launches , kites and inoperable radio navigational aids			0
@entity3 says space debris the size of the @entity18 components re-enters the atmosphere about once year			2
@entity107 astrophysicist @entity106 noted that @entity18 is far from being the biggest space junk to come back			0
" this is nothing like the old @entity111 scare of the ' 70s when you had a 70 - ton space station crashing out of the sky			2
so , i agree with the folks in @entity34			0
it 's nothing to be worried about , " @entity106 said			0
pieces of @entity111 came down in western @entity119 in 1979			1
the only wild card @entity106 sees is if somehow a chunk hits a populated area			0
" if the thing happens to come down in a city , that would be bad			0
the chances of it causing extensive damage or injuring someone are much higher			0
" @entity3 says once the debris hits the atmosphere 50 miles up , it will take only a matter of minutes before the surviving pieces hit the @entity7			1
@entity1 's @entity135 contributed to this report .			0

pieces of the satellite will crash back to @entity7 friday
@entity3 ca n't predict the exact location of where they 'll hit
in 1979 , @entity111 fell from orbit and some pieces hit @entity119
