@entity0 , @entity1 -- the competitive spirit between @entity1 and @entity4 rarely dims , but @entity4 has sprinted ahead of its trans - @entity6 rival to become the first country in the @entity9 to legalize same - sex marriage			1
the move has left @entity1 's gay community feeling behind in terms of gay rights			1
the @entity4 @entity15 passed legislation with a convincing 77 to 44 vote amending the @entity18 to permit gay , lesbian , transgender , bisexual and intersex couples to marry			1
the vote caused the supporting @entity4 lawmakers to erupt into applause and an overjoyed public gallery to burst into song			1
the lawmaker responsible for the bill , @entity30 , thanked her female partner as she grasped a bouquet of rainbow - colored flowers			2
" nothing could make me prouder to be a @entity35 than passing this bill , " @entity30 said			0
meanwhile in @entity1 , the rainbow symbol -- long associated with gay activism -- has taken on a more militant meaning with a social media - fuelled rainbow revolution underway in which activists across @entity1 have been " chalking " the colors of the rainbow in public spaces			1
the nationwide protest was triggered by a @entity47 government decision to remove a rainbow - painted pedestrian crossing in the city 's gay heartland			1
painted at a cost of 110,000 @entity1 dollars , and with the permission of the authorities during the last @entity55 in march , it was ordered to be removed by the state 's roads minister , @entity56 , soon after the partying ended			2
@entity56 said removing the crossing , at a cost of 30,000 @entity1 dollars , was necessary because it was a distraction to drivers and posed safety risks			2
the move gave rise to a @entity67 protest page that garnered widespread support and surprised even its instigator , @entity70			0
" i just thought it would be really funny to put on @entity67 , i thought i 'd get 50 likes on my wall , " @entity70 told @entity71			0
shops have reported depleted stocks of chalk as hundreds of rainbow crossings have appeared across the country , including small towns			0
the phenomenon , meanwhile , has spread worldwide			0
rainbow crossings have appeared in @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			0
but the chalk protest and the vote in @entity15 have not moved @entity1 politicians			1
prime minister @entity93 said she could n't see @entity1 following @entity4 , although she has permitted a conscience vote on a same - sex bill when it was debated and failed last year			1
'' i doubt we 're going to end up agreeing , '' she told a member of the public at a community cabinet meeting in @entity101			0
@entity93 believes marriage is an act between a man and a woman			0
she has , however , said she would allow another conscience vote and has urged the opposition coalition leader @entity107 to do likewise			0
although several @entity109 frontbenchers support it , @entity109 lawmakers were denied a conscience vote during last year 's same - sex marriage bill vote			1
@entity107 , like prime minister @entity93 , remains unmoved by @entity4 's decision			2
' we had a parliamentary vote on this just a few months ago ... and it was fairly decisively rejected , " he said			0
while @entity1 's political leaders have not been swayed , @entity4 's vote has given new hope to @entity1 's gay community			1
@entity122 national convener , @entity124 , said the @entity4 move could be a ' game changer ' because @entity1 and its nearest neighbor are so culturally inter-linked			1
" growing international pressure takes it up a notch , " @entity124 said			0
" those @entity1 who support this reform will be inspired and encouraged to redouble our efforts in trying to achieve this for @entity1 , " he said			2
@entity124 said the fact conservative @entity4 prime minister @entity136 allowed his parliamentary colleagues a conscience vote and voted for the law himself , could change the political appetite for reform in @entity1			1
" it sends a direct message that this is an issue conservatives can support			0
it will increase support for a conscience vote despite what @entity107 says , " @entity124 said			0
" i would n't be surprised if there 's a push for a conscience vote before the election , " he added			0
@entity124 predicts thousands of @entity1 gay couples will begin to make their way across the @entity6 to marry because the @entity4 legislation does not limit the right to marry to residents			1
" they 'll be returning to @entity1 to find that their solemn vows of lifelong commitment are not recognized in @entity1 law			2
they will be one of the important catalysts for change in this country , " he told @entity2			0
nevertheless , he said he wo n't be amongst those leaving @entity1 to tie the knot			2
" i want to marry in my home state , @entity170 , " he said			0
the benefit to the @entity4 economy is expected to be big			0
@entity124 's @entity174 lobby estimates it will be in the order of 700 million @entity1 dollars while @entity176 of @entity177 believes it will be worth between 150 and 160 million @entity1 dollars			2
" @entity4 is set to reap a massive economic dividend from the wedding - spend of those @entity1 same - sex couples who are tired of their country 's failure to act , " @entity124 said			1
@entity1 census statistics show that some 1,300 gay couples had traveled to @entity187 and @entity188 to take advantage of same - sex marriage laws			1
a sizeable proportion of couples using @entity4 's civil union law since it was passed in 2005 , have been @entity1 too .			1

@entity4 @entity15 votes 77 to 44 to allow same - sex couples to marry
lawmakers erupt into *spontaneous* song after the amendment is passed
@entity1 's gay community feels it is *lagging* behind its more *progressive* trans - @entity6 rival
@entity1 has started a ' rainbow *rebellion* ' chalking *streets* with rainbow symbols
