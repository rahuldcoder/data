-- @entity2 agreed to temporarily relocate members of an @entity5 opposition group , considered a terrorist organization by the @entity7 , while a @entity1 refugee agency begins efforts to resettle the exiles , the @entity1 announced on its website monday			1
under the @entity1 agreement , @entity2 will relocate the residents of @entity14 , also known as @entity2 -- the home of the opposition group @entity15 , or @entity15 -- to a temporary camp			1
there , the @entity1 high commissioner for refugees will begin efforts to resettle the group outside of the country , the statement said			0
the @entity23 government has said it will close the camp by december 31 , and without a @entity1 agreement there were no clear assurances the exiles would be protected against attacks by @entity23 forces , or reprisals from neighboring @entity5			1
@entity5 and the @entity7 consider the @entity15 a terrorist organization			0
it has been on the @entity7 terrorism list since 1997 because of the killing of six @entity7 in @entity5 in the 1970s and an attempted attack against the @entity5 mission to the @entity1 in 1992			1
a memorandum of understanding between the @entity1 and @entity2 was signed sunday , the same day that the @entity5 exiles claimed in a statement that two rockets struck their camp in northeastern @entity2			1
" i want to make it very clear that this memorandum of understanding is about voluntary relocation and its implementation is based firmly on all sides acting peacefully and in good faith , " said @entity44 , special representative of the @entity1 's secretary - general and head of the @entity47 ( @entity47 )			1
@entity44 , who signed the agreement , also called on member nations to accept the @entity5 exiles in to their countries			1
the agreement includes " a clear commitment from the @entity59 to ensure the safety and security of the residents at the new location , " according to the @entity1 @entity7 secretary of state @entity64 welcomed the agreement , calling it a viable solution and urged the @entity5 group to accept it			1
" to be successful , this resettlement must also have the full support of the camp 's residents , and we urge them to work with the @entity1 to implement this relocation , " @entity68 said in a statement released late sunday			2
" all those who want to see the people at @entity14 safe and secure should work together to see that the agreed upon plan is carried out			0
" @entity79 , spokesman for the @entity80 , the political coalition that includes @entity15 , said the group was waiting to see an official document from the @entity1 regarding @entity14			2
" we hope that it would officially include the minimum assurances so that it would be acceptable to @entity14 residents , " @entity79 said			0
" @entity14 residents had repeatedly emphasized that they would in no way accept forcible relocation			0
" @entity79 said his group welcomed @entity68 's statement			0
" but we reject and consider unacceptable anything contrary to her statement , " he said			0
the agreement also calls for @entity95 to immediately deploy a team to the temporary camp and provide " around the clock monitoring " of the group until it is resettled outside of @entity2 , the @entity1 said			1
@entity14 was established in 1986 after @entity100 invited members of the @entity15 to relocate to @entity2 in an effort to undermine the @entity5 government , which was at war with @entity2			1
since 2004 , the @entity7 has considered the residents of @entity14 " noncombatants " and " protected persons " under the @entity108 , though the group remains on the @entity7 terror list			0
a @entity1 commission on refugees has described the residents as " formal asylum seekers " against persecution by the regime in @entity5			2
the group believes the current regime in @entity2 , under orders from prime minister @entity120 , has twice staged deadly attacks against the camp that resulted in the deaths of almost 50 people			2
more than 3,000 exiles , described as @entity5 resistance figures and their sympathizers , live at the camp			2
under the plan , the @entity14 residents will be moved to a camp near the @entity132			0
the facility will remain open for an unspecified period of time , though a senior @entity7 administration official said last week that there were plans to keep it open until all of the camp residents were resettled			0
@entity0 's @entity141 and @entity142 contributed to this report .			0
