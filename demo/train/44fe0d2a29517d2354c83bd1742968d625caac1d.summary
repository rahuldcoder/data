@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 search - and - rescue teams have found another body aboard the partly sunken cruise ship @entity8 , civil protection office spokeswoman @entity3 said sunday			1
the woman is the 13th confirmed victim of the wreck on january 13			1
divers are working to recover the body , which was found underwater on bridge number 7 , @entity3 said			1
the victim was wearing a life jacket , she said			1
the discovery leaves about 19 people still missing since the ship hit rocks in the shallow waters off the coast of @entity22 , according to @entity2 count			1
a 12th body was found within the ship saturday afternoon , according to @entity5 authorities			1
the body of a woman wearing a life jacket was discovered in an area of the ship that was under water , @entity3 said			1
a committee comprising the parties involved in the rescue told a briefing for reporters and residents on the island that search and rescue efforts will continue -- but that the environmental risk is also becoming urgent			2
officials said they can not predict how long it will take to clear the wreckage , since that depends on maritime conditions and technical difficulties , but all legal , environmental and human factors will be taken into account			0
" it 's time for @entity1 to show it can do something right and do it well , " said @entity52			0
@entity52 , who leads @entity1 's civil protection agency , warned that the task ahead was complicated and daunting , not least because it takes about 45 minutes to search each cabin , using special cameras and divers			2
the giant @entity8 had 1,500 cabins on board			2
@entity52 said no fuel oil had yet leaked from the ship -- only kitchen and engine oil -- and that he did not see an immediate risk of the 2,400 tons on board escaping			1
a plan to remove the fuel oil has been approved , he said , and will begin once experts give the go - ahead			1
booms have been put in place around the ship to stop the spread of oil and other pollutants such as detergents and sewage chemicals			2
with 4,000 people aboard , the ship was the size of a small town , @entity52 said			1
fuel will be replaced with water as it is removed from the ship 's tanks to keep the ship balanced , said adm. @entity89 , head of coastal authorities for the port city of @entity92			1
@entity52 said @entity93 , the company that owns the cruise ship is cooperative and was proving responsible , despite past errors			0
both @entity93 and authorities have criticized capt. @entity97 , who is under house arrest and faces possible charges of manslaughter , shipwreck and abandoning ship			2
an audio recording obtained by @entity1 's @entity107 newspaper and published saturday shows that the captain , at least at the outset of the incident , assured authorities he would do the right thing			0
according to the recording , an @entity5 @entity113 official asks @entity116 how many people needed to be evacuated to the top of the ship to be rescued on life boats			1
" about two of three hundred people still , " the captain says			0
the @entity113 asks -- will everyone evacuate , or will someone stay behind ? " i will stay here , " @entity116 answers , saying that he believed that the boat was done leaning over			0
other audio recordings previously released , however , indicate that @entity116 did not stay on board , but left the ship , to the anger of authorities			2
the office of prosecutor @entity130 said it would lodge an appeal against the investigating judge 's decision to grant the captain house arrest			0
@entity130 has said he that the captain should be in jail given the flight risk , and the gravity of his crimes			0
@entity116 's lawyer , @entity141 , spoke to @entity5 news channel @entity142 on friday , urging people to reserve judgment on the captain until they have all the facts			0
@entity116 's leadership has been repeatedly questioned			0
earlier this week , a cook from the ship told a @entity150 television station that the captain ordered dinner for himself and a woman at about 10:30 p.m. -- less than an hour after the collision			2
however , a @entity155 woman , @entity97 , 25 , who also works for the cruise line but said she was on the @entity8 as a passenger , defended the captain in a tv interview			1
" i 've heard in @entity161 media that the captain left the ship first , or among the first			0
but this is not true , " she said			0
prosecutors have accused the captain of piloting the ship too fast to allow him to react to dangers , causing the shipwreck , according to legal papers			0
there were roughly 4,200 people on the @entity8 when it ran aground -- about 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members			1
the vast majority fled the ship safely			0
@entity2 's @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 and journalist @entity181 contributed to this report .			0
