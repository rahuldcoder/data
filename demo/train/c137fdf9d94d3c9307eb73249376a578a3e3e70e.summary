@entity0 -- when president @entity3 addressed the nation in the hours following monday 's @entity5 , he did not use the word " terror , " immediately raising questions			1
when he took the podium at the @entity11 less than 24 hours later , his phrasing changed			0
but he still was very careful about what he said , making separate points			0
" any time bombs are used to target civilians , it is an act of terrorism , " @entity3 said			1
he said it was unclear who carried out the attack and why , but that the @entity22 bombings were a " heinous and cowardly act " that the @entity24 is investigating as an act of terrorism			1
the two bomb blasts near the downtown finish line of the storied marathon killed three people , including an 8 - year - old boy , and sent more than 170 others to local hospitals , some with critical injuries			0
with developments unfolding late on monday , @entity3 spoke to the nation from the @entity11 , saying " we still do not know who did this or why " and cautioning @entity38 against jumping to any conclusions			1
" but make no mistake , we will get to the bottom of this and we will find out who did this			0
we 'll find out why they did this , " he said			0
@entity3 , calling attack ' terror , ' shifts to response though @entity3 did n't mention " terror , " federal investigators and a @entity11 official later classified the bombings as such			1
those close to the case have said it is not clear whether the attack was domestic or foreign in origin			0
it makes sense @entity3 would be cautious in his initial public remarks and then clarify matters later with more information known , said @entity66 , a former assistant @entity38 attorney who helped prosecute the @entity68 bombing case			2
" the president is absolutely right in cautioning people we do n't know who did this , " @entity66 said			2
' @entity22 will overcome , ' mayor vows amid bombing investigation careful decision - making in communicating information to the public seems to reflect lessons learned by a chief executive who has had to navigate the aftermath of attacks or threatened attacks where @entity38 lives were lost or threatened			1
" there were three attacks in the first 17 months of the administration , four if you count @entity94 , " said @entity88 , who served as a director of the @entity90 for the @entity91 during @entity3 's first term			1
" what we learned in dealing with each of those is it 's important for government officials to communicate early and reassure the public , " he said			1
the president learned that lesson on christmas day in 2009 when a passenger attempted to detonate a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard an international flight heading into @entity108			1
the @entity11 called it an attempted terrorist attack and it took @entity3 three days to address the incident publicly , delay that some @entity113 in @entity114 criticized			2
a thwarted attempt to detonate explosives in @entity119 's subway system in september 2009 , the november 2009 shooting massacre at @entity94 , @entity116 , and a failed bombing of @entity119 's @entity118 in may 2010 offered valuable lessons on communicating early , often and cautiously , @entity88 said			2
the administration has also benefited from consistency in staffing			0
key officials , including @entity11 chief of staff @entity128 , who in 2009 served as @entity131 chief of staff , and homeland security adviser @entity132 , who formerly served as a senior @entity91 official , are at @entity3 's side now			1
the administration also learned a tough political lesson around the word terror when @entity3 was hesitant to say it outright when first describing the deadly attack on the @entity38 diplomatic mission in @entity141 , @entity142 , last september			1
details emerge : @entity22 bombs may have involved pressure cooker , timer the president did call the attack one of several " acts of terror			1
" the administration 's reluctance to clearly label that attack terrorism and comments blaming events initially on a response to an @entity158 film ignited partisan bickering and an election - year showdown with @entity113 over his administration 's handling of the matter			2
politics aside , experts point out that classifying an attack as terrorism carries important legal and investigative meaning			0
" you know , there 's been much discussing about the parsing of words : is this terrorism , is n't it terrorism , it 's criminal ? first of all , terrorism is a crime			2
so it 's automatically a criminal case if it 's a terrorism case , " said @entity180 , a former @entity24 assistant director and @entity1 contributor			2
" but secondly , if it was not terrorism , the @entity24 would not be in charge			0
it would be @entity188 running this case			0
so it 's clear the authorities are absolutely clear			0
this is a terrorism investigation			0
it 's a terrorism case , " he said .			0
