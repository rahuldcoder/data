@entity0 -- families of @entity4 passengers on board missing @entity6 have engaged in a rare late - night act of civil disobedience in this tightly - controlled city			1
after unsuccessfully demanding a meeting with the @entity13 ambassador at their hotel for more than eight hours , angry relatives pushed past police officers who tried to stop them from making a midnight march across the @entity4 capital			1
their destination : the @entity19			2
" the ambassador kept saying he would come but he never showed , " an elderly man told @entity1 as he and scores of others walked quietly through @entity0 's streets			2
as has been the practice of many other @entity4 passengers ' next of kin , the man asked not to publish his name			2
they 're lying to us , " the man repeated			0
" and now we 're going to the embassy			0
if they wo n't come to us , we 'll go to them			0
" the surreal late - night procession was followed closely by police squad cars			0
around midnight , more than one hundred relatives staged a pre-dawn sit - in outside the embassy gates			1
though vastly out - numbered by @entity4 security forces , the family members continued their stubborn vigil throughout the morning			2
they remained camped out by the diplomatic mission more than 15 hours later			0
periodically , they chanted " fulfill your commitments ! no more delays ! no more lies ! " throughout the sit - in , no @entity13 diplomat came out to meet with protesters			1
the demonstrators finally dispersed peacefully before sunset on friday , after camping out by the diplomatic mission for more than 17 hours			0
the small gathering departed after delivering a letter of protest to the embassy demanding an explanation for how the prime minister of @entity13 has concluded that the plane ended its flight over the @entity61			0
broken promises for weeks , distraught next of kin have requested face - to - face meetings with @entity13 officials			1
they are demanding a briefing on details of the last moments before flight 370 was believed to have disappeared over the @entity61			0
in the absence of information from @entity13 authorities , many relatives continue to believe their missing loved ones are still alive			1
on several occasions within the last two weeks , @entity13 officials in @entity0 and @entity78 publicly pledged to meet the @entity4 families within a matter of 24 hours , but then failed to show up for talks			1
" we just want them to stop breaking their promises again and again , " said @entity83 , a spokesman for the families , whose mother went missing when the @entity86 disappeared on march 8			0
he spoke to @entity1 in a " journalist 's area " located out of sight of the @entity13 @entity19 protest			1
even at the early hour of 1 a.m. on friday , @entity4 police had cordoned off an area for media around the corner from the sit - in			1
during the day , security forces continued to prevent journalists from reaching the families			0
public protests are extremely rare in @entity4			0
the @entity103 crisis , which has involved the highly emotional disappearance of 153 @entity4 nationals who were on board the plane , has put @entity4 authorities in an uncomfortable position			2
the @entity4 government has tolerated -- but stopped far short of endorsing -- the political mobilization of the flight 's next of kin			0
families have organized committees , issued press releases , and printed t - shirts and hats with the slogan " pray for @entity6			1
" but they have also been largely prevented from organizing public displays outside the windowless hotel conference room that serves as the families ' improvised headquarters			0
on friday a spokesperson for the @entity4 foreign ministry , @entity126 , called on the families protesting outside the embassy to " express their appeals in a legal and rational way " while pledging to give them further assistance			1
he urged the @entity13 authorities to " actively " pursue the investigation			1
