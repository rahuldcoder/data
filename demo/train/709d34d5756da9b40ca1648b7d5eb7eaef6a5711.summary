@entity0 -- a divided @entity2 has ruled the government has the power to criminalize " material support " of a foreign terrorist organization			1
the 6 - 3 decision monday preserves a key provision of the 2001 @entity9 , amid claims it threatens the free - speech rights of @entity13 who would assist non-violent activities of certain militant and terror groups			1
at issue was the portion of the federal law that allows prosecution of those who provide " any service , training , expert advice or assistance " to a foreign terrorist organization , as designated by the @entity13 government			1
" providing foreign terrorist groups with material support in any form , " wrote chief justice @entity29 , " furthers terrorism by straining the @entity35 's relationship with its allies and undermines cooperative efforts between nations to prevent terrorist attacks			1
" justice @entity40 authored a powerful dissent , fearing the law could be interpreted too broadly by the government in the name of protecting @entity13			1
" precisely how does application of the statute to the protected activities help achieve that important security - related end , " he asked			1
since the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks against the @entity13 , federal prosecutors have pursued " material support " cases against at least 125 individuals or organizations , winning convictions in about half of those cases			1
nearly every domestic terrorism - related prosecution has included the charge as part of the indictment			1
groups listed as " foreign terrorist organizations " by the @entity64 include @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
a federal appeals court in @entity69 , @entity70 , struck down several parts of the legislation , finding them too vague to satisfy the @entity73			2
the government then asked the high court to intervene and uphold the law			2
the key plaintiff in the appeal is the @entity79 , a @entity80 , @entity70 - based non-profit that says its mission is to advocate " for the peaceful resolution of armed conflicts and for worldwide compliance with humanitarian law and human rights law			1
" it sought interaction with the @entity89 , a group active in @entity90			2
known as @entity89 , the party has been labeled a terror organization by the @entity13 and the @entity93			2
its leaders have called for militancy to create a separate @entity98 state in the parts of @entity90 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 where @entity103 are a majority			0
in its appeal to the high court , the government noted that " since its inception , the organization has waged a violent insurgency that has claimed over 22,000 lives			0
" @entity79 claimed it wanted to advocate on behalf of the @entity89 before the @entity112 , and conduct other advisory sessions and public awareness campaigns			0
@entity40 , in an unusual step , read a portion of his dissent from the bench			0
he said the majority wrongly read the law " to forbid the teaching of any subject where national security concerns conflict with the @entity124			1
the @entity73 does not allow all such conflicts to be decided in the government 's favor			0
" @entity40 was supported by justices @entity128 and @entity130			0
the court 's majority opinion was not a complete victory for the government and came with an important caveat			0
the activity in question can be banned only if " coordinated with , or controlled by foreign terrorist groups			1
" the justices gave no specific guidance on how that distinction should be made			0
the court also said the law does not extend the ban on material support to domestic groups			1
" the government is wrong that the only thing actually at issue in this litigation is conduct , " said @entity29			0
" plaintiffs want to speak to [ certain foreign designated groups ] and whether they may do so under [ the federal law ] depends on what they say			1
if plaintiffs ' speech to those groups imparts a ' specific skill ' or communicates advice derived from ' specialized knowledge ' -- for example , training on the use of international law or advice on petitioning the @entity162 -- then it is barred			2
on the other hand , plaintiffs ' speech is not barred if it imparts only general or unspecialized knowledge			0
" @entity2 nominee @entity174 had argued the administration 's case as solicitor general , back in february			0
that was before she was tapped by president @entity179			0
" @entity67 builds bombs , " she said of the @entity181 militancy group			0
" @entity67 also builds homes			0
what @entity184 decided was when you help @entity67 build homes , you are also helping @entity67 build bombs			0
that 's the entire theory behind this statute , and it 's a reasonable theory			0
" @entity192 , a 79 - year - old civil rights lawyer who founded @entity79 25 years ago , told @entity1 he feared being arrested if he continued his international outreach efforts with groups designated as terrorists			1
" my mission would be to work with these groups , to try and convince them to use peaceful means to resolve these ongoing conflicts , " he said after the arguments			2
he filed the lawsuit against the government			0
there was no immediate reaction from his group or the government			0
but human rights groups criticized the ruling			1
" the @entity2 has ruled that human rights advocates , providing training and assistance in the nonviolent resolution of disputes , can be prosecuted as terrorists , " said @entity209 of the @entity210			2
" in the name of fighting terrorism , the court has said that the @entity124 permits @entity184 to make human rights advocacy and peacemaking a crime			1
" the @entity9 was passed six weeks after the 9/11 terrorism attacks			1
it included amending a previous anti-terror law to strengthen the " expert advice and assistance " provision , making it a crime punishable by a 10 - to - 15 year prison sentence			2
the case is @entity233 ( 08 - 1498 ) .			2

new : applies only to activities coordinated or controlled by foreign terrorist groups
6 - 3 ruling upholds provisions of the 2001 @entity9
providing support in any form " furthers terrorism , " chief justice writes
dissenting justice says @entity124 should sometimes prevail
