-- while the @entity2 gets ready to crown the best films of the past year , we 've got something else for your consideration			1
from " @entity7 2 " to " @entity8 , " @entity0 presents your guide to the biggest , best and buzziest movies of 2013			1
comic book heroes comic book franchises will be flying by us faster than a speeding bullet this year , from a reboot of the @entity15 ( replacing @entity16 from " @entity17 " with @entity18 for " @entity19 " june 14 ) to the set - in - @entity20 " @entity21 " july 26 to " @entity22 : @entity23 " november 8			1
but topping all of these on the anticipation meter ( and hitting theaters first on may 3 ) is " @entity27 3 , " which brings @entity27 back from the epic team - up of " @entity7			1
" it also kicks off the next phase of @entity33 movie standalones like " @entity22 " and " captain america : the winter soldier " that lead into " @entity7 2			1
" the stakes are more personal for @entity27 this time out , and although comic book fans will recognize the classic characters , @entity27 's got new on - screen villains to contend with such as @entity41 / @entity41 , played by @entity42			1
" the level of security that i got to go through to learn my own lines is out of control , " @entity42 told @entity0			1
" they have a @entity33 security guy whose job it is to run around and find photographers hiding in the forest			1
" hence the minimal leaks			1
still , if 2012 is any indication , it 's safe to say we 'll all be watching			1
funny guys @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 will be back in " anchorman : the legend continues " on december 20 , just in time to keep @entity65 classy for @entity66			1
of his dim - witted character @entity68 , @entity61 said that he hopes he has n't changed at all since the first film , which came out in 2004			1
" i think it 's such a great ensemble piece that i would hope that our roles are the same as they were the first time around , " @entity61 said			1
" the storyline is going to be different , but i hope the people in it are exactly the same			1
" " great " books " oz : the @entity83 and @entity84 , " " @entity82 , " " @entity81 " -- sense a theme there yet ? all of these films based on classic literature have , well , great expectations associated with them , but the anticipation around the @entity90 story starring @entity91 as @entity92 has dimmed a bit since its @entity95 release ( its release in the @entity97 is tbd )			1
then " @entity82 " had its release date shuffled from december 2012 to may 10 , 2013 , curtailing potential @entity2 nominations this time around ( although the trailers still look promising )			1
this leaves @entity105 's " @entity78 " film , out march 8 , to take the lead			2
in this origin story , @entity107 stars as the would - be wizard who leaves @entity110 and lands in @entity78 where he meets a bevy of witches played by @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116			2
" it 's otherworldly , " @entity115 said			2
" it 's not just a different country ; it 's like a different planet			2
" @entity123 with no more " @entity124 " or " @entity125 , " movie studios have been scrambling to create new teen - oriented franchises , and only " @entity129 " has caught fire so far			2
the second installment of the series , due november 22 , just wrapped shooting in @entity133 ( the new game , featuring survivors of @entity129 past , has a water - and - jungle theme )			1
fans are eager to see @entity140 ' wedding dress , the clock - structure of the arena and the confrontation with president @entity144			2
( not to mention some extra kissing this time around ! ) but hot on the heels of " @entity147 " are some worthy contenders , including boy - centric " @entity149 " ( out november 1 ) , " the @entity151 : @entity152 " ( out august 23 ) , and the first of the @entity155 books to be adapted , " @entity156 " ( out february 13 )			2
the latter two are good - versus - evil supernatural stories : " @entity151 " is about half - angel demon hunters , or @entity160 , and " @entity156 " is about light and dark witches , or casters , who discover what they are during a ceremony at age 16			2
" we 've really loved everything we 've seen so far in the film , " said " @entity156 " co-author @entity168			2
audiences will likely love @entity173 's take on the lollipop - wielding @entity174 , who casts her siren spell with each lick			2
@entity178 the first nine minutes of " @entity179 , " out may 17 , are already showing in select theaters , which has amped up @entity182 speculation about plot points : could this be a contemporary " @entity184 ? " will @entity186 's mysterious " @entity187 " character become @entity187 ? pointing in this direction is the casting of @entity190 as @entity191 , @entity193 's long - lost love and inventor of the dangerously powerful @entity196 device , which could turn uninhabitable worlds into class @entity199 planets suitable for humans but could also destroy all pre-existing life			2
@entity203 's " gravity , " which features " two people floating in space , " as @entity206 put it , is also enticing			2
@entity206 's co-star is @entity208 , who dominates the film , and together , they are the two survivors of a damaged space station			0
reports from early test screenings suggest the film , out october 18 , is gorgeous and awe - inspiring , but also divisive along the lines of " @entity216			0
" reboots 2013 will see its fair share of familiar properties getting new life in the form of remakes and reboots			1
" @entity229 " series ( which has existed as radio and tv shows and several film incarnations ) becomes a @entity231 movie ( out july 3 ) with @entity232 and @entity233 aboard for a @entity235 - centric story			1
@entity238 - created @entity237 agent @entity236 has been played by @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 , and now @entity242 is getting his turn , with a release date set for december 25			0
@entity245 hands the " @entity248 " baton over to @entity247 on october 18			1
and @entity250 's @entity97 remake of the @entity252 thriller " @entity253 , " out october 11 , stars @entity254 as an executive who has been mysteriously confined for years and is now freed , and sets out to find out who stole his life			0
will there be any eating of live octopus like in the original ? they 're not saying , but producer @entity263 promised other " treats " for fans			0
" if you look carefully , you 'll see some of the cast from the original , " he said			0
dragons there 's no competition for " @entity271 , " the second installment of which is due out december 13 as the @entity274 get closer to their goal of reclaiming @entity276 ( after getting captured by both giant spiders and elves )			1
" the @entity281 " will feature @entity186 as the dragon @entity279			0
" he 's absolutely fantastic , " gushed co-star @entity282			0
@entity279 will be the first performance - captured dragon , and thanks to advancements in technology , we should be able to see more emotion and musculature in his face in the same manner in which @entity294 was improved for " @entity271 : an @entity295 , " only on a much bigger scale			1
also look for some more elf action in the second " @entity271 " film , with the return of @entity300 as @entity301			1
@entity302 @entity304 fans have three ways to see their favorite actor in 2013 : in " @entity307 , " " @entity308 " and " @entity309			0
" the third of these , due march 29 , reunites @entity304 with his " @entity312 " director @entity311 and kicked off his romance with co-star @entity314			0
the movie has been getting rave reviews on the festival circuit , even if @entity304 's role as a motorcycle stunt rider who resorts to bank robbery sounds like a rehash of what he did in " drive			0
" this time , however , it 's more of a family drama ; @entity304 really only carries one third of the film			0
( meanwhile , " @entity308 " is a reunion with his " drive " director @entity329 , but has yet to screen )			0
@entity332 there wo n't be a bigger zombie apocalypse than " @entity8 , " and it 's got one of the biggest stars ( @entity337 ) to anchor it			0
@entity340 's book featured interviews from various survivors of the @entity343 , which gave both a time line and a sensation of the global nature of the catastrophe			1
@entity337 's character has the unenviable job of tying up disparate storylines , but if anyone can do it , it 's him			0
on the comedic side , it 's a toss - up between @entity357 's directorial debut " @entity358 , " out june 14 , and @entity360 's " @entity359 , " out october 25			0
in " @entity358 , " an unspecified global cataclysm wipes out many famous actors playing themselves ( including @entity363 ) , so @entity357 and friends hole up at @entity107 's house and try to ride it out			0
" we joke about ( the potential for a sequel ) , but i do n't know where it would exist , " @entity357 laughed			0
" but they 'll make a sequel out of anything			0
there 's a script for " @entity377 " lying around somewhere			0
" then , in the bound - to - be - self - referencing " @entity381 , " @entity378 , @entity379 and friends try to do a pub crawl on their last night alive			0
fans of " @entity384 " and " @entity385 " know this will be epic			0
@entity387 what is it with all the films this year about @entity122 becoming an inhospitable planet ? " @entity397 " ( starring @entity398 , out march 1 ) , " @entity399 " ( starring @entity400 , out april 19 ) , and " @entity401 " ( starring @entity402 , out june 7 ) share common themes , but only the first two seem to blame rampant corporatization and wealth discrepancies instead of nature			1
" after @entity122 " focuses on survival ; " @entity399 " is about an underground resistance ( led by @entity406 )			0
but " @entity397 , " directed by @entity407 ( of " @entity409 " fame ) has the most socio - political overtones			0
in this scenario , the rich live on a luxurious new world called @entity397 , and the poor live on @entity122 , which has become overpopulated , diseased and crime ridden			0
@entity398 's character fights to make a better life for himself , and inadvertently , everyone else .			0
