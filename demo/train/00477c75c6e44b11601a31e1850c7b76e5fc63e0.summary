, but he gets my vote as the greatest practitioner of good bad movies working in @entity9 today			0
i do n't mean that as a backhanded compliment			0
it takes a certain kind of genius to crank out blockbusters as spectacularly silly as " @entity16 , " " @entity17 " and " 2012			0
" and the main difference between @entity1 and fellow maestros of mayhem like @entity21 is that he actually seems to be in on the joke			2
he knows his movies are preposterous nonsense , and he embraces it			0
@entity25 explains why men in action movies wear those white tank tops in his latest big - budget excuse to blow up @entity30 , " @entity42 , " @entity1 does n't waste time with anything as conventional as a setup ; he just dives right in , introducing us to @entity36 's @entity35 , a divorced @entity37 police officer itching to be a @entity39 agent to impress his daughter ( @entity41 )			1
while his job interview in the @entity45 is going south , right - wing mercenaries take over the @entity46 demanding $ 400 million			2
meanwhile , @entity35 's daughter has been taken hostage and the president ( @entity49 ) is left unguarded			1
guess who steps in to protect the @entity51 ? ' @entity52 ' of @entity53 : actors who will not star in ' @entity52 ' @entity1 and screenwriter @entity55 ( " @entity56 " ) rip off " @entity58 " beat for beat			1
but when you 're having this much fun , why quibble ? the entire film is merely an excuse for @entity36 to squeeze off machine - gun rounds in a muscle - baring tank top , @entity49 to do his cool - cat @entity67 impression right down to chomping on @entity68 , and @entity1 to revel in what he does best â € ” blast the sets ( and plausibility ) to kingdom come			1
comparisons between this and last march 's similarly themed " @entity75 " are going to be inevitable , so let me just say that @entity1 's is the @entity78 disaster flick to see			1
skip it , and you 'll be depriving yourself of one of the summer 's most satisfyingly stupid pleasures			2

" @entity42 " stars @entity49 as @entity51 and @entity36 as a police officer
when mercenaries take over the @entity46 , @entity36 dives in to protect the president
@entity1 's " @entity42 " blows up sets and plausibility
but when you 're having this much fun , why quibble ?
