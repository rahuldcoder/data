-- when @entity2 and @entity3 began planning their wedding , they also looked for ways their guests could share photos of their ceremony and reception			1
" we thought about using disposable cameras , putting them on all the tables , and letting people take pictures , " said @entity3			0
but the thought of collecting cameras and developing film seemed antiquated			0
then they came across @entity20 , one of several photo - sharing apps for weddings			1
the app lets guests upload images directly to a private album viewable online by the bride and groom , wedding guests and other invitees			1
" everyone 's got their phone in their pocket at all times , " said @entity3			0
" they 're snapping pictures , they can immediately upload the photos , and now we have all the pictures to share with everyone else			1
" since the @entity46 signed up for @entity20 , 423 photos have been uploaded to their page			1
the pictures range from their courtship to the engagement party and all the way to their april wedding in @entity54			2
" now we have pictures just in one place to remember our entire wedding , " @entity55 said			1
no longer do brides and grooms have to rely on a single official photographer to capture all the key moments from their big day			0
increasingly , couples are crowdsourcing their wedding photography through @entity20 and similar photo - sharing apps such as @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
most wedding apps are free and are available for @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity75 devices			1
guests can also upload images to the apps ' websites from a desktop or digital camera			2
online wedding albums are kept private unless couples enable social sharing , which allows guests to share photos and videos back out to their existing social networks			1
" it enables every couple to create a private social network around each of their individual weddings , " said @entity89 , ceo and co-founder of @entity20			1
" we see people uploading photos and videos from early on in their engagement all the way through the honeymoon			2
" incorporating technology at weddings has become increasingly popular			2
according to a recent survey from wedding site @entity107 , 19 % of couples are using wedding apps to crowdsource their photos and another 41 % are considering doing so			1
other couples are taking this a step further by inviting guests to share their wedding photos in real - time streams on social media			1
" a lot of couples are creating their own custom hashtags for their wedding and then encouraging guests to take photos and upload them to @entity125 and sometimes @entity126 , " said @entity118 , site director for @entity107			1
still , @entity118 does n't see apps or hashtags replacing the professional photographer at weddings			0
" the one gripe i might hear is that guests kind of get in the way , " she said			0
" if you have a bunch of guests with their phones up , it changes the look of the photo entirely			0
on the other hand , i do n't hear photographers who are worried that this is going to take away from their business			0
" wedding photos : when snap - happy guests go too far the prospect of a sea of smartphones and point - and - shoot cameras sticking out of the aisles has led some couples to want to unplug			1
according to @entity156 's survey , 28 % of brides have either asked or are planning to ask their guests not to take photos during the ceremony			2
" unplugged weddings have become sort of a trend because it 's so common for everybody to have their phones out , " @entity118 said			0
" the idea there from the couples ' perspective is that everyone is going to be really present			0
" even so , a lot of couples still want as many photos as possible to remember the big day , she added			2
since 2012 , more than a million people , including couples and their guests , have signed up for @entity20 , @entity89 said			1
@entity89 started the company in his basement in @entity177 , @entity178			0
he had 12 people working for him full time when his young company was featured in the local newspaper			0
" the day after ( the story ) was released , we got a knock on the door with somebody showing an eviction notice , " he said			0
" it turned out to be a blessing in disguise because we landed our first tech angel investor			0
" since then , @entity20 has moved offices and raised even more money			2
the company recently closed their first round of venture - capital funding , and future prospects look bright			0
after all , said @entity89 , " people are always going to be getting married			0
