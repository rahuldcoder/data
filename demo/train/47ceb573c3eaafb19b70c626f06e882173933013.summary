@entity0 , @entity1 -- heart - wrenching cries echo through the halls of the neonatal intensive care unit at @entity6			1
nearly half of the newborn babies in the hospital 's @entity9 are suffering from prescription drug withdrawal			1
for over a year , the @entity0 hospital has been dealing with a dramatic increase in the number of newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome , or @entity18 , which is the withdrawal process a newborn baby goes through after in utero exposure to certain medications			1
" when i first got into neonatology the most common problem -- and still the most common problem -- that we take care of is premature babies or babies with respiratory distress , " said neonatology director dr. @entity22 , a 17 - year veteran at @entity23			1
" but i had no idea that we would be seeing this issue , to this degree			0
" narcotics used during pregnancy pass through the placenta to the baby			0
once the baby is born , he or she no longer has access to the drugs and will likely go through withdrawal			1
according to @entity22 , opioids -- like oxycodone -- are the worst offenders for the babies suffering from @entity18 at his hospital			1
between 55 % and 94 % of babies exposed to opioids prior to birth exhibit signs of withdrawal , according to the @entity53			1
the babies are easily agitated and cry constantly , and many can not be near sound and light			2
other symptoms can include a distinct , high - pitched cry , tightening of the muscles and seizures			0
while prescription drug abuse is a problem in nearly every neighborhood in @entity65 , it is particularly epidemic in @entity1 , which ranks among the top states in the overuse of prescription pain medications			1
study : every hour , a baby is born with @entity18 a recent @entity1 health department survey found that about a third of pregnant women in state treatment programs are addicted to prescription pain meds			1
as a result , the number of babies born with @entity18 at @entity6 doubled from 2010 to 2011			1
this epidemic is tearing apart families in eastern @entity1 , according to @entity84 attorney @entity83			1
" in @entity87 , we 're drowning , " she said			0
" we 've seen the number of children in foster care increase by almost 50 % over the last few years , and that 's just the tip of the iceberg because we 're trying to keep the children out of foster care			2
we 've got lots and lots of relatives who are raising drug - exposed infants			2
" state caseworkers are called in to handle the worst cases of babies suffering from @entity18			1
" we come and talk to the mom and try to find out , what 's the level of her abuse , what 's the level of her addiction , what can we do to get her clean so that she can be in a position to take care of her baby , " @entity83 explained			2
since the epidemic is relatively new , there is no national protocol on how to treat @entity18			2
@entity6 focuses its treatment on two areas : environmental and medicinal			0
last year , the hospital created a wing of private rooms that is quieter , darker and easier to control for the massive influx of babies suffering from drug withdrawal			1
the hospital also trains volunteers , called cuddlers , to hold and comfort the babies			2
@entity129 , a retired marketing professor and grandfather , spends six hours a week giving these babies a little extra love			2
" it 's tremendously rewarding to take a stressed baby and work with that baby until that baby is feeling better or sleeping , " @entity129 said			0
" it also makes the job of the nurses a lot easier			0
it 's a lot easier for them to come into a room and deal with a calm baby , rather than a crying baby			0
so i feel like i 'm really helping the nurses , as well as helping the babies			0
" in addition to improving their environment , the hospital has also developed a successful drug treatment program for these babies , according to pharmacist @entity155			1
" when i first arrived , we were treating the babies and stabilizing them on methadone and then discharging them to have outpatient treatment , " he said			0
" then we decided that probably was n't the safest and most effective way to treat them			0
so we decided to switch to the morphine			0
" treatments are individualized based on the severity of withdrawal and babies are given small doses of morphine every three hours with feedings			2
over the following weeks , doses are gradually decreased to wean babies off the drugs			2
since adopting the morphine protocol , the average hospital stay for these infants has decreased by several days , now averaging 24 days			0
as @entity6 continues to treat these defenseless drug - dependent babies and chip away at the underlying causes of drug abuse through education and proper medical care , @entity22 admits that the future for these newborns with @entity18 is uncertain			1
" there is no doubt that they are at an increased risk for problems with their learning and development throughout their childhood , and problems with behavior once they reach school age , " he said			0
in the meantime , the hospital has become a pioneer in the treatment of babies with @entity18			1
other states are turning to them for guidance			0
" this problem is faced all over the country ... and people are interested in what we 're doing because we know it 's a safe , successful plan to administer , " @entity155 said			0
" the process is complex to wean these babies and we think that what we 've developed has helped make the complex , simpler			0

@entity1 ranks among the top states dealing with prescription drug abuse
about half of all babies in intensive care at one hospital suffer from drug withdrawal
opioids , like oxycodone , are the main drugs in these babies ' *systems*
most are *diagnosed* with neonatal abstinence syndrome , or @entity18
