-- as casualties mount before the brutal onslaught of @entity5 's forces against @entity7 's pro-democracy protesters , the @entity1 are being unhelpful again			1
in @entity9 and @entity10 , even habitually cool diplomats have been showing frustration			0
on january 31 @entity1 joined with @entity12 to block a plan presented to the @entity14 by @entity15 and supported by the @entity16 that called on @entity5 to hand power to his deputy , who would then call a general election			1
if @entity5 did not comply within 15 days , the resolution threatened undisclosed " further measures			1
" @entity23 already had vetoed one resolution denouncing @entity5 's use of force in october			1
as @entity29 leaders sought to pry the @entity7 dictator from power , his old friends in @entity23 sent an aircraft - carrying missile cruiser to @entity7 waters in a show of support last month and shipped his troops a consignment of @entity40 cruise missiles			2
such actions are just the latest in a litany of obstructionist maneuvers and spoiler ploys whose goal often appears merely to undermine @entity29 international objectives			0
from @entity9 , @entity23 has seemed determined to soften or delay sanctions on @entity49 aimed at curbing its nuclear ambitions , to stall in talks with @entity53 over its nuclear weapons , to intimidate pro-democracy movements in neighboring states , and to egg on anti-american dictators such as @entity60			0
@entity29 commentators typically attribute such behavior to @entity64 's personal paranoia or to attempts to rekindle the nation 's wounded pride and assert @entity1 's superpower status			1
look a little closer , however , and @entity1 's actions seem motivated more by calculated -- albeit sometimes miscalculated -- realpolitik than by psychological impulses			1
first , strategic interests are at stake			0
in @entity74 , @entity7 hosts the sole remaining @entity1 naval base on the @entity76 , currently being refurbished by 600 @entity1 technicians after long disuse			1
to have to give up this @entity80 beachhead would be a shame , as far as the @entity1 are concerned			2
second , although limited , @entity1 has real commercial interests in @entity7			1
contracts to sell arms to @entity85 -- both those signed and under negotiation -- total $ 5 billion			0
having lost $ 13 billion due to international sanctions on @entity49 and $ 4.5 billion in canceled contracts to @entity90 , @entity1 's defense industry is already reeling			1
besides arms exports , @entity1 companies have major investments in @entity7 's infrastructure , energy and tourism sectors , worth $ 19.4 billion in 2009			1
counting pennies while protesters are gunned down may seem cynical			0
" how many people need to die before the consciences of world capitals are stirred ? " @entity104 's foreign secretary @entity103 demanded on january 31 , clearly thinking of @entity23			0
but @entity1 policymakers have developed an allergy to @entity29 leaders ' moralizing			2
just as it was pressing @entity5 to resign , the @entity109 quietly lifted a ban on military aid to the @entity113 dictatorship in @entity114 , which had butchered its own protesters a few years earlier			2
( @entity114 is important for supply lines to @entity118 troops in @entity119			0
) neither did @entity9 press the king of @entity121 -- where the @entity122 has a port -- to step down after he crushed popular demonstrations in his capital			0
from @entity9 , the @entity128 's recent interventions in the @entity80 seem unplanned and responsive , with modest goals			0
from @entity23 , it is easy to see a pattern in the repeated use of force to overthrow leaders -- from @entity119 and @entity135 to @entity90 -- and diplomatic pressure to dislodge others -- in @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			0
president @entity141 may be gone , but his " @entity143 , " it sometimes seems , lives on			0
@entity90 is a particularly sore point			0
@entity1 's leaders felt they were tricked into supporting a resolution to protect civilians only to see it used to provide cover for airstrikes to overthrow @entity151			1
vague phrases like " further measures " now set off alarm bells			0
beyond commercial and strategic interests , the @entity156 's greatest fear is of instability in the @entity80 and @entity159			2
@entity1 policymakers already worry about the northward spread of @entity163 militancy and opium if the departure of @entity118 from @entity119 leads to @entity167 resurgence and state collapse			2
rather than a fairytale struggle between the people and a dictator , they see a potentially explosive religious conflict between @entity7 's ruling @entity174 ( close to @entity175 ) and majority @entity176			1
the zeal with which rulers of the @entity180 and some in @entity9 call for @entity5 's ouster seems part of a broader project to isolate @entity49 , @entity7 's ally			1
still , unless @entity5 manages to decisively defeat his opposition in short order , the @entity1 are likely to soften their position -- not because of moral arguments , but simply because they do not want to end up on the losing side			1
if they alienate @entity5 's successors , the very interests they seek to protect could be in jeopardy			1
@entity1 foreign secretary @entity193 hinted at a shift on january 31 , saying : " we are not friends or allies of president @entity5			1
" picking the perfect moment to dump a congenial dictator is never easy -- consider @entity9 's contortions over @entity201 in @entity139 and the @entity203 embarrassment over their late coddling of @entity151			0
walking out too soon risks alarming other allies			0
waiting too long creates the image that one is both reactionary and out of touch			0
the @entity156 's policymakers are hardly adept at this , and certainly may wait too long			0
so far , they believe @entity5 still has a reasonable chance of survival			2
if his prospects dim -- as seems likely -- some minor rephrasing of the @entity14 resolution will likely be enough to satisfy @entity1 concerns and bring them on board			1

@entity1 is standing in the way of a @entity14 resolution against @entity7 's leader
@entity225 : @entity1 has strategic and business reasons to favor the *regime*
@entity225 : @entity1 is betting on @entity5 , but if he *wavers* , it may join in opposing him
