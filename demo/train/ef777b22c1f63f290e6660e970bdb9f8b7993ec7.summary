" now he 's in the queue with everyone else trying to get on a train , " @entity110 said			0
" and the trains simply are n't going at the moment and it 's unlikely they 'll be going really in sufficient numbers for days to come " security is tight at the railway station as people occasionally stampeded the barricade in an attempt to get closer to the train platforms , to no avail			0
armed riot police entered the station on wednesday to regain control of the situation			0
so far , @entity1 authorities have managed to persuade nearly 470,000 people to abandon their travel plans and accept a refund for their train tickets			2
