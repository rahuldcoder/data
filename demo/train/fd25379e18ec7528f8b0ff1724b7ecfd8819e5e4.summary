-- will elementary and middle school students soon be able to put up their own @entity3 pages ? it looks like it			1
according to news accounts , @entity3 is considering doing away with its rule that no one under age 13 may have a @entity3 page			1
cranky math instructors and tyrannical @entity12 coaches must be at least a tad nervous at the thought of what the little darlings might post about them			0
but the change could be a good thing if it encourages a reasonable amount of parent involvement			0
the things the rest of us do on @entity3 -- reveal what we had for lunch , post way too many photos of our kids and pets , comment on what @entity29 wore for her 60th anniversary jubilee -- are considered too dangerous for 10 - , 11 - , or 12 - year - olds to do , even if their " public " consists only of people they 've invited to be their friends			1
one result is that millions of pre-teens -- 7.5 million , according to a @entity39 account last year -- have established profiles on @entity3 , some using fictitious names			1
five million of them are younger than 10			1
what 's most disturbing is that in many cases , parents have helped their kids circumvent the rules			1
what , pray tell , does that teach their children ? the parameters of the policy under consideration at @entity3 are undetermined but would work something like @entity56 movies			1
one idea is that the child 's page would be linked through the parent 's page -- a sidecar , if you will			1
savvy parents would give their children as much privacy as possible even if wincing sometimes at what they saw			1
but they 'd also have the opportunity to step in if they noticed something that was hurtful , dangerous or inappropriate			0
schools of thought : my kids wo n't be on @entity3 anytime soon despite what some adults might think or read , teens , at least by their own account , are pretty responsible when it comes to social networking			2
according to the @entity81 's internet and @entity82 , more than 7 out of 10 teens say that other teens with whom they 're online are kind , not mean			1
of course , they 've seen instances of cruelty			0
but let 's not forget they see that in school , too ; in fact , according to what they told @entity81 , most of the bullying they see or experience happens in person			2
only 15 % say they 've been victims of online cruelty -- interestingly , the same proportion of adults who report being hurt by other adults			0
according to @entity81 , teens are receiving lots of counsel about @entity80 safety and responsible behavior			0
@entity107 , who directs @entity109 's research on teens , children and families , was struck by how many different advisers there were			2
kids on @entity3 ? some people think otherwise " teens average five sources from which they receive advice about online safety and responsibility , " she said			1
parents give the most , followed by teachers , the media , siblings or cousins , friends and older relatives			0
@entity81 also found evidence that many parents and other adults are monitoring teens ' online profiles			2
" the village is active , " @entity107 says			0
that 's on behalf of teenagers			0
just think how much guidance the under - 13 set would receive			0
some people will find it hard to believe @entity81 's findings			0
we do n't hear or read much about what adults are doing to ensure , as much as possible , the safety of children and young people who go online			2
what we do hear about , particularly from companies that want to sell certain kinds of software to protect users , is the cruelty and misbehavior that the @entity80 makes possible			0
@entity156 certainly , one can buy commercial software that can , for example , track a child 's texts , block texting altogether and monitor a child 's location			2
but such software should be a last resort			0
a better first step is to share questionable online experiences with our preteens on sites like @entity3 , in order that they learn how to handle such situations on their own			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

@entity3 is considering changing rule to allow preteens to have their own pages
@entity179 : 7.5 million preteens are already on @entity3 , 5 million under 10
children 's pages could be linked through their parents ' pages , she says , allowing *supervision*
@entity173 : letting your child have a @entity3 page is a chance to teach safe online behavior
