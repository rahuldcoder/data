-- it 's a beautiful fall morning looking out over the @entity2 © ber , just a few blocks from the @entity4			2
i 've checked into @entity6 , a @entity7 at @entity8 , on a brisk , blue - sky day that makes you want to stroll the streets with a stop at the boulangerie for a pain au chocolat , or two			1
but that might prove difficult			0
i 'm not in @entity8			1
i 'm in @entity16 , in an identical mock - up of the hotel 's @entity8 rooms			1
the room 's large , with three - meter ceilings you might find inside a century - old @entity24 building			1
there 's a dressing room that 's as big as the oval - shaped white marble bathroom next door , where the clock above the vanity is set to @entity8 time			1
in the bedroom , there 's a stack of @entity35 magazines in a rack next to the sofa			2
it does feel like i 'm in the @entity35 capital , even down to the exact street views you get from the real property			2
@entity44 's @entity8 hotel does n't open until august , but the project team at @entity46 ( @entity47 ) , @entity44 's parent company , designed and built this fully functioning model room back in 2011			1
test before release this is where @entity44 tries out new ideas and technology for a full year , before releasing its designs into the world			1
i 'm the first journalist allowed access to see how the concept works			1
such is the confidentiality surrounding these unseen rooms , i 'm sworn to secrecy as a condition of my visit			2
the @entity8 property 's pictures are n't even made available to me			1
this is basically a place to make mistakes , so they do n't get made in the real world			2
" what happens if you wake up in the middle of the night ? do you bump your knee on anything ? if you 're in the bathroom , does it all work ? " asks @entity76 , ceo of @entity47			0
for example , the " @entity81 " carpet originally laid will never see action			0
when the housekeepers came in to vacuum , it grew bald patches			0
the built - in television cabinet flanked by a hidden mini-bar and built - in espresso machine ( with bilingual instructions ) replaces a design that featured a fireplace and an in - mirror hidden tv			2
the team learned that watching tv during daylight hours was impossible , due to the glare from the mirror , which stretched up to the ceiling			0
eventually the fireplace was cut too , and the single - panel door design was revised because it was too heavy to lift			0
what i see , and what will appear in @entity8 , are two ivory - colored panels that split and slide up and down			1
@entity44 has been building these rooms at a location in @entity16 with every new property or major renovation since the 1990s , including the construction of its tower rooms in @entity16 ( 1994 ) , and its hotels in @entity112 ( 2007 ) and @entity113 ( 2009 )			1
to visit @entity113 , i just have to go next door , where the colors are richer and bolder , and the accents @entity116 , in keeping with the hotel 's location on the @entity120			1
@entity112 's modern lines and zen touches must be around here somewhere , though my hosts remain tight - lipped			2
rooms full of secrets i later learn the @entity112 tester room has been demolished			0
with construction in its final stages in @entity8 , and the @entity113 hotel open for more than three years , these rooms have n't seen as many visitors lately			1
but in 2011 and 2012 , the @entity8 mock - up would have been busy with members of management teams and special guests staying one or two nights			1
chairman sir @entity138 , whose family opened the first @entity44 in @entity16 85 years ago , has stayed overnight in the @entity8 , @entity113 and @entity112 models			1
even couples have shared the king - sized bed			0
at the end of their stay , guests are asked to fill out a questionnaire that can take hours to complete			0
executives give their suggestions directly to the project team , or , in the case of coo @entity152 , experiment with changes themselves onsite			0
@entity44 says @entity152 moved around and angled different sofas , armchairs , and coffee tables until he was satisfied with the setup			0
there was also debate over the look and feel of the curved bathroom in @entity8 and whether it was worth the wasted space ( its predecessors in @entity113 and @entity112 are rectangular , though the guestrooms have a similar overall layout )			2
other changes were initiated from feedback that the room did n't feel " parisian " enough			0
the color scheme was changed from beige and bronze , to grey and chrome , and the wall coverings , carpet , and some of the furniture was adjusted			0
and there were lots of other small tweaks , including the addition of a built - in reading light in a floor lamp			0
a world of mock - ups @entity44 is n't the only hotel company to build and test model rooms			1
@entity190 which owns @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , and others brands , has a design lab at its @entity197 headquarters that features test rooms for some of its hotel lines , though not for each new property			0
and while @entity44 wo n't disclose how much it costs to build , test , and maintain the model rooms , its ceo says they are an investment worth making			0
" the purpose of doing all of this is not to add more gold and silver into the design , " @entity76 explains			0
" it is very focused on ergonomics , which is the sheer convenience of staying in that room and whether everything works			0
" my @entity8 stroll and fresh croissants will have to wait			2
i head down a short hallway past some @entity223 - inspired art , open a mirrored door , and step back into the @entity16 sunshine			1
the @entity8 , the luxury hotel group 's 10th hotel , is set to open on august 1			1
@entity44 is also planning properties in @entity228 and @entity229 , @entity230 .			0
