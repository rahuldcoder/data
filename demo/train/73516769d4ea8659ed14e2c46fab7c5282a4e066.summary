-- whether it 's a weekend barbecue or roasting marshmallows on a camping trip , cooking over an open fire is a novelty that many @entity6 enjoy			1
but for nearly half the world 's population , building and maintaining a fire is a daily -- and often deadly -- chore			2
in remote villages and city slums , women tend to fires for hours on end , breathing in smoke that is the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day , according to the @entity20			2
many of these women have their children close by or strapped to their chest or back , and the dangerous pollutants from the smoke can result in severe damage to their lungs as well			0
@entity28 witnessed this firsthand while working with a medical team in @entity31 more than a decade ago			1
" there were doctors on the medical team who could not put tubes down the babies ' throats because the throats were so choked with creosote , " said @entity28 , a 70 - year - old grandmother who lives in @entity32 , @entity33			1
" imagine you 've got a new baby and you could n't save that baby 's life ... and it 's because of cooking			1
" inhaling this polluted air has also been linked to pneumonia , heart disease , lung cancer , low birth weight and respiratory infections , just to name a few			0
@entity28 spent years working with engineers to create the @entity55 , a stove that burns cleaner to make it safer for people and better for the environment			1
in 2008 , she founded @entity60 , which she says has established factories that have produced more than 37,000 stoves and improved the lives of more than 280,000 people in @entity65			1
" cooking should n't kill , " she said			0
an estimated 4 million people each year die from exposure to cookstove smoke , according to the @entity70 ( @entity71 )			1
but @entity28 and her group are trying to help change that			1
by using a cleaner combustion process , the @entity55 stove reduces carbon emissions and particulate matter by 70 %			1
the quick - cooking unit is also cost - efficient and portable , and it requires no installation or external chimney			1
" it 's kind of a little miracle , " said @entity28 , explaining that the " e " stands for environmental and " cocina " is the @entity82 word for kitchen			1
@entity28 ' stoves also provide an economic boost to the communities where she works , because they are all built by local laborers using local materials			1
in the last five years , her group has helped start six factories in five countries : @entity95 , @entity31 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98			0
" it not only employs the people in the factory , but obviously they 're buying all their supplies locally			1
so anything they need , they 're helping boost the local businesses , " @entity28 said			1
" also , some of the individuals who buy stoves are starting their own catering businesses			0
" today , 45 people are employed at the factories that her group has helped establish			0
" on one of my recent visits , one of the guys came up to me and wanted to have a picture taken , " @entity28 said			1
" he said very proudly , ' before i had this job , i was picking coconuts -- and now i am a welder ! ' " it 's an impressive accomplishment for @entity28 , who did n't begin working in this area until a little more than 10 years ago			1
she 'd spent most of her life as a stay - at - home wife and mother , but after losing her husband to cancer in 2001 , @entity28 was looking for a change			2
her inner " travel bug " kicked in , and when she heard about a local medical team that was planning to volunteer in @entity31 , she signed up to go as a cook			0
" it 's an awful situation down there , " @entity28 said			2
" the homes are made out of whatever material is around			0
sometimes they 're made out of plastic bags woven together with sticks			0
... rarely do they have windows or ventilation			0
" she was stunned to realize that women often spend more than 14 hours a day inside tending to an open fire , and she was horrified to see entire families suffering from chronic coughs and respiratory infections , not to mention burns			2
one woman 's story was a turning point for her			0
@entity151 , 18 , had fallen into an open fire as a toddler , and her hands were literally burned shut			0
the medical team treated @entity151 and was able to restore the use of her hands , but @entity28 said she knew she needed to do more			2
" i thought : ' this is crazy			0
so what can we do to prevent it ? ' " she said			0
@entity28 teamed up with rocket engineer @entity162 , who created the original @entity55 design			2
then she joined forces with @entity165 around the world , and together they began partnering with local entrepreneurs to start factories			2
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity172 not only are the stoves improving and saving people 's lives -- they are also saving forests			1
in much of the world , @entity28 says , a household will use 50 - 100 pounds of wood to cook each day			1
the @entity55 requires 50 % less wood than a traditional open fire , and twigs and fallen branches can be used to heat the stove			2
even the stove itself is designed to be environmentally friendly			0
" we wanted it made out of local materials , biodegradable materials , so if anything happened to the stove or if someone abandoned it , the materials would just go back to nature , " she said			1
the stoves typically cost between $ 40 and $ 45 to make , including labor and materials , @entity28 said , and they sell for $ 50 - $ 60 depending on the factory site and their specific costs			1
@entity204 received a free @entity55 as part of a community grant in @entity95			0
his daughter @entity207 suffered from asthma so severe she was hospitalized often twice a week , but the @entity55 changed that			0
now , @entity207 needs far fewer trips to the hospital and the entire family breathes easier			0
" @entity207 's health has improved dramatically since we 've had the stove , " @entity204 said			0
" the new stove has helped improve her health and the health of our family			0
" @entity28 is not paid for her work , and occasionally she dips into her own her savings to contribute to the project			2
it 's her passion -- or as she calls it , her obsession			0
" if anyone told me i 'd be doing all this at this age , i would n't have believed them , " @entity28 said			2
but @entity28 -- who plans to open new factories in @entity230 and @entity97 in the next year -- intends to spend the rest of her life doing this work			1
with 3 billion people , mostly women and children , facing health risks from open fires or leaky cookstoves every day , @entity28 says there are just too many who need help			1
" the best part of doing it is seeing the people who benefit , " @entity28 said			1
" anybody can do this			0
you just have to have a purpose and a passion			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity60 website and see how to help .			0

across the world , cooking smoke is killing an estimated 4 million people every year
@entity28 is trying to save lives through a portable stove that burns cleaner
the stoves are built locally using local materials , so they also provide an economic boost
