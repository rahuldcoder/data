@entity0 -- rep. @entity4 has said he has no plans to resign over a " sexting " scandal , and that his wife wants him to stay in @entity9 , a @entity3 source told @entity1 thursday			1
@entity4 made the remarks to a @entity12 @entity3 colleague from @entity13 on wednesday afternoon , rejecting growing calls from fellow legislators -- including key @entity3 -- for him to step down , said the source , who was familiar with the conversation			1
@entity4 also cited polling data showing a majority of @entity13 voters want him to remain in office , the source said , describing @entity4 as " dug in			1
" the source spoke to @entity1 on the condition that the name of the @entity3 @entity13 lawmaker to whom @entity4 spoke would not be made public , because it was a private conversation			1
after more than a week of bad news that began over @entity29 weekend with the first reports of his sexual - tinged online communications with several women , @entity4 got some good news thursday : new polling information showed 56 % percent of constituents in his home disrict want him to stay on			1
however , @entity3 colleagues on thursday continued to call for him to bow out , including veteran @entity39 sen. @entity38 and @entity41 rep. @entity40			1
@entity38 , who ranks second in @entity54 seniority , " supports minority leader ( @entity44 ) @entity46 's request for a @entity12 investigation , and he believes that a decision by @entity49 to voluntarily leave office would be in the best interests of his constituents and the @entity12 , " @entity38 spokesman @entity42 said			1
he and @entity40 joined sen. @entity55 of @entity56 and @entity57			0
@entity58 of @entity59 , @entity60 of @entity61 , @entity62 of @entity56 , @entity63 of @entity64 , @entity65 of @entity66 and @entity67 of @entity68 in calling for @entity4 's resignation			1
" enough is enough , " @entity67 said in a written statement			0
" it 's time for congressman @entity4 to resign			1
his actions have disgraced the @entity9			0
everyone should be focused on jobs and the economy , and his refusal to do the right thing is a distraction			0
" in addition , @entity67 and some other @entity3 have announced that previous campaign contributions they received from @entity4 would be donated to charity			2
another top @entity83 , sen. @entity84 of @entity85 , stopped short of calling for @entity4 's resignation but offered a barb attributed to former president @entity88 in saying , " do n't murder someone who is already committing suicide			1
" " i think he has some serious problems that will not go away soon , " @entity84 added			0
the actual quote attributed to @entity88 , a @entity3 president who served from 1913 to 1921 , is : " never attempt to murder a man who is committing suicide			0
" a @entity3 legislator familiar with discussions on the situation told @entity1 that @entity4 's colleagues are telling him he should resign " to preserve his own dignity			1
" the legislator , who spoke on condition of not being identified by name in order to discuss private conversations , said the public call by @entity58 was part of a stepped - up effort to force @entity4 out			1
according to the source , the effort includes private and public calls explicitly telling him it 's time for him to leave @entity9			1
" there is increased resentment by his colleagues that far from having a press conference where he was going to tell the truth and roll with the flames , the flames are just getting worse and he 's dragging us through it , " the source said			2
" we really thought by now , after the press conference , we would be able to talk about the @entity125 ' social security privatization bill and instead we keep talking about @entity4			2
and people are getting angrier and more resentful			0
" a new explicit photograph now published on the @entity130 , allegedly of @entity4 's naked genitals , is the latest example of how the issue is not going away , the @entity3 legislator said , adding it was unclear if @entity4 would listen			1
meanwhile , it is highly likely @entity4 's district will be eliminated as part of next year 's redistricting process , multiple @entity13 @entity3 sources told @entity1			1
@entity13 will lose two of its 29 @entity141 @entity12 seats by 2012 in line with recent @entity141 @entity144 results			0
@entity4 , who is married , admitted earlier this week that he engaged in sexually tinged communications with multiple women and lied about it			2
@entity4 and his wife , @entity148 , are expecting their first child , @entity1 has learned			1
@entity46 , @entity151 , who called monday for an ethics investigation , released a letter tuesday detailing her formal request for the inquiry			0
she has not spoken on or released further statements on what she thinks @entity4 should do			2
@entity4 , who has said he would welcome an ethics probe , publicly apologized monday for sending flirtatious messages and images on @entity161 and @entity162 to six women over the past three years and then denying it for a week			2
over the past three days , he has been reaching out to a number of colleagues and supporters , according to one source			0
among other things , @entity4 called former president @entity170 -- who officiated at his wedding ceremony -- to personally express regret for his actions			2
according to a @entity3 congressman who got one of the calls , @entity4 was " very contrite " and said he " let everyone down			2
" the legislator , speaking on condition of not being named because it was a private conversation , said @entity4 was so choked up he could " barely get the words out , " and told him that he was going to " get some help			1
" wednesday 's publication online of the explicit photo that a conservative blogger claims shows @entity4 's genitals was the latest twist in the scandal			1
@entity189 , whose biggovernment.com website broke the story of @entity4 's sexting , said the photo came from a woman who told him @entity4 sent it to her			1
@entity4 acknowledged monday that such an x-rated photo of him could exist			1
also wednesday , one of the women with whom @entity4 communicated online said the congressman initiated sexual exchanges			2
" i would want to talk politics			0
but he would turn it creepy , " @entity203 , a 40 - year - old blackjack dealer from @entity204 , told @entity205 ' " @entity207			0
" @entity203 said she believes @entity4 has " a weird fetish , " but that " it does n't make him a bad politician ... or a bad congressman			0
it makes him a bad husband			0
" asked what she 'd say to @entity4 's wife , @entity203 said : " i want to apologize			1
i should not have been flirting with her husband			0
" an ethics investigation would examine if @entity4 violated @entity12 rules or brought the chamber into disrepute			0
the code of conduct for members of @entity9 calls for them to conduct themselves " at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the @entity12			0
" however , ethics experts say legislators are rarely , if ever , disciplined for violating that rule alone			0
using government technology such as telephones and computers for his sexting could be another story			0
@entity4 said monday he used his personal @entity236 and home computer , but added : " i do n't have the knowledge of every last communication , but i do n't believe that i used any government resources			0
" even if he did , that does n't automatically subject him to @entity12 discipline , said @entity243 , a former @entity12 general counsel who has represented legislators before the ethics panel			0
members of @entity9 sometimes use official resources for nongovernment activities , @entity243 noted , adding that " the @entity12 has never taken a position or disciplined someone for that use			0
" @entity1 's @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 contributed to this report .			2
