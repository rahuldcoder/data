-- sometimes , when you least expect it , the good guys win			1
sometimes , the good guy is a woman -- a strong , wise and extraordinarily brave woman , such as @entity5			1
@entity5 , 67 , has led her people in a decades ' long quest for democracy in @entity10 , the country renamed @entity10 by a brutal military dictatorship , which now appears ready to usher in democratic reform			1
at a time when the struggle against dictatorships elsewhere in the world seems to bring nothing but disappointment and bloodshed , @entity5 's freedom and the richly deserved accolades she is receiving are a welcome reminder that nonviolence , smartly deployed and backed by powerful international supporters , can become a most powerful weapon			1
this week , @entity5 made a triumphant and stirring return to the world stage , traveling to the @entity28 , her home for 24 years before she became an accidental leader of the revolution and the regime 's prisoner in her home in @entity34 , the generals ' new name for @entity34			1
@entity5 was received as a hero in world capitals			1
she spoke to the @entity39 and received an honorary degree at @entity41			2
but the most poignant moment of her five - country trip came when she delivered the @entity46 lecture in @entity47 , @entity48			2
she gave the speech more than 20 years after her chair had stood empty on the stage during awards ceremony in 1991 , the year she won the prize , as she languished in isolation , enduring years of house arrest			2
" @entity69 , " as she is known among her countrymen and women , stands as one of the few genuine heroes of our time , someone in the mold of @entity61 and @entity62 , who not only inspired by their ideals and sacrifice but , just as importantly , who prevailed in achieving their goals against powerful foes			1
there was always something mystical about the way the small , willowy woman struck fear in the hearts of the generals -- humorless men in starched uniforms , leading one of the world 's largest armies and most ruthless regimes			1
her family name was well - known at home before she became an activist			2
her father , gen. @entity88 , was the hero of @entity10 's battle against @entity91 colonial rule and a revered statesman			1
during the first quarter - century after the military took power , @entity5 lived abroad , as a mother , wife and academic			1
but then her mother became ill. she traveled to @entity10 from her home in @entity100 to care for her			2
suddenly , she was in the middle of a revolution			2
when anti-junta protests broke out in august 1988 , she addressed a crowd of hundreds of thousands at the iconic @entity106 shrine in @entity34			2
she unexpectedly became the movement 's leader and her life changed forever			1
she would spend 15 of the next 22 years as a prisoner in her own home			0
the regime put down the uprising ( known as 8 - 8 - 88 ) killing some 3,000 protesters			0
@entity5 found herself as a top target of the regime			1
even under arrest she managed to lead efforts to topple the dictatorship			0
the @entity28 looked to her for guidance			0
she looked to her @entity122 faith , learning to understand and endure her own suffering and keep her focus not on herself but on the larger goals of human rights and freedom for all			0
she told the @entity28 to maintain strict sanctions			0
she feared the world would forget her , as she lived out her life in isolation under heavy guard on @entity34 's @entity134			1
in 1999 , when her husband was dying of cancer in @entity91 , the junta refused to let him come to @entity10 to say goodbye , offering instead to let her leave			0
she knew if she traveled abroad she would never be allowed to return			0
she stayed a prisoner in @entity10 and never saw her husband again			0
@entity5 's unique brand of " realistic idealism " appears to have succeeded in pressuring the junta to start relinquishing power			1
she won a seat in parliament in april elections , part of a slow process of promised democratization			0
she is preparing her party , the @entity149 , for general elections in 2015			0
her personal story , closely braided with that of her country , proves that nonviolence is not just a philosophy , not just a moral stance			0
instead , it is a tool that can bring heavily armed opponents to their knees			0
the technique worked because her charisma , spirituality and moral courage inspired not only her people , but the rest of the world			1
that created the pressure to build international economic sanctions that eventually forced the regime to fold			0
there 's more to it , of course			1
@entity174 , the junta 's protector , overplayed its hand in exploiting @entity10 's vast natural resources			1
but the bottom line is that without international support , the strategy probably would not have worked			0
without @entity5 , the world would not have known about the misery and repression that the junta had foisted on the @entity10 people			1
nonviolence is not always a viable course of action -- its slow methods can run out of time , or simply fail against despotism -- but sometimes it can work			0
i had counted myself as a skeptic -- until i traveled to @entity10 during the days when it all seemed hopeless and finally understood what her presence there meant to the @entity10 people			0
in @entity10 and in the @entity10 refugee camps on the @entity201 side of the border , i discovered just what @entity5 's strength and personal sacrifice meant to her people			1
she had become their only source of solace , their only reason for hope			0
she was also their movement 's brilliant strategist			2
in recent months , the generals who have ruled @entity10 since 1962 have declared their commitment to democratic change and have started loosening restrictions on political activity			0
the world is taking its cue from the woman who has become a moral compass			2
for years she was the one who insisted the @entity28 should not lift economic sanctions , even when that meant more hardships for her and her people			0
but now she says she cautiously believes the generals are serious about reform			0
ever the realist , @entity5 has warned against overconfidence , calling for " healthy skepticism " about reforms			1
but if she and her supporters do , in fact , forge democracy in their country , as now seems probable , it is because she was able to leverage her appeal to bring harsh international sanctions against @entity10			2
@entity5 has proven her wisdom			1
she has proven she is one of the few people who truly deserve to become a hero , an icon of their time			1
and she has shown , just when we needed it most , that even in a time of grim realities , heroes can win in the end			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity252 .			0

@entity254 : @entity5 's quest for democracy inspires with its apparent success
@entity259 says others struggling with dictatorships can look to her as reminder they can win
