-- although details are still emerging in this most recent tragedy , we know an officer repeatedly shot and killed an unarmed 18 - year - old black man , @entity5 , in a @entity7 suburb last weekend -- less than two days before he was scheduled to attend college			1
last month , @entity9 , another unarmed black man , died from an illegal police chokehold during an encounter on @entity12 , @entity13			1
nearly 20 years ago , my son @entity14 also died in an illegal police chokehold			1
@entity14 was playing football in the street with his brother when their ball accidentally hit a police car			1
instead of addressing real public safety issues , a @entity13 police officer chose to harass my sons brutally			2
these cases and many more reveal our country 's systemic criminalization and devaluing of black and brown lives			0
twelve years after @entity14 was killed , @entity13 police officers fired at an unarmed @entity35 50 times and killed him the night before his wedding			1
the detectives who were responsible were acquitted of criminal charges			0
just three years later , a @entity40 police officer in @entity41 , @entity42 , shot and killed 22 - year - old @entity43 while he was facedown on a subway platform , posing no threat			1
it inspired a movie , " @entity48			0
" the transit police officer who shot him was convicted of a lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter and spent 11 months in prison			1
two years ago , unarmed @entity54 was fatally shot by a @entity13 police detective during a highway traffic stop			1
the detective was not indicted			0
also two years ago , unarmed 18 - year - old @entity58 was shot and killed by a @entity13 police officer who unlawfully entered his home and killed him in front of his grandmother and 6 - year - old brother			1
a judge threw out the first indictment against officer @entity66 , who fatally shot @entity58 , and a second grand jury failed to re-indict him			2
just this january , an off - duty @entity69 police officer shot and killed 26 - year - old @entity70 , a father and college student who worked part time , at a strip mall			1
the investigation is still pending			0
these are just some of the dozens of police killings of unarmed @entity76 by law enforcement over the last decades			2
these tragedies and injustices happen year after year , and people of color -- primarily black and @entity82 -- are usually the victims			2
sadly , our communities in @entity13 and elsewhere are almost conditioned to expect these incidents -- the loss of our children , siblings and spouses to excessive violence by those whose job it is to protect us			0
@entity13 police commissioner @entity93 's recent comment dismissing that race was a factor in @entity9 's death is a slap in the face to those of us who 've lost our children , and it is part of the problem that allows such unjust killings to continue			1
in addition to the pain families experience from losing their loved ones , we are also forced to endure additional injustices , when again and again government and the criminal justice system fail to hold officers accountable , and instead the victims are criminalized			0
similar to the response in @entity9 's case , the @entity111 attempted to blame my son for his death by saying that he and his brother resisted arrest			1
but what were they under arrest for ? playing football in the street ? even if we hypothetically assumed the officers ' allegations were true -- although they were not and a federal court found the officer guilty -- how does that justify killing someone ? with @entity93 as police commissioner then and today , we see a similar response			2
in many of these unjust killings , @entity13 police detailed victims ' past involvement with the criminal justice system to the media , as if that justified their lives being taken by the police			2
we 've seen it with @entity9 , and we saw it with @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and many others			2
also , district attorneys fail to convene a grand jury or secure a conviction			0
we must question the closeness of district attorneys to police departments , given their interdependence			0
in only a handful of these cases , including my son 's , the federal government stepped in to provide some limited accountability			2
in @entity5 's killing , the @entity161 will conduct a parallel investigation to one already under way by the @entity165 , @entity166 , police			1
like it did with my son , the @entity161 review will focus on possible civil rights violations in his killing			0
that is the only way my son got justice -- when the federal government found the police officer who killed my son violated his civil rights			1
where is the justice for families like those of @entity58 ? it 's been two years since his death and a year since the @entity183 said it was reviewing the case but still nothing			0
the family does n't even know whether the officer responsible for killing him in cold blood has been disciplined or still walks around with a gun and shield			0
those with a badge who unjustly kill and brutalize should be stripped of their badge , their gun , their job and their pension because they have violated the public trust			0
a systemic lack of accountability and inadequate discipline allows these incidents to continue to happen			0
and now , in the wake of @entity9 's death , @entity93 and the @entity111 are responding in the same way they always have -- pledges of more training			1
it 's not training that will prevent this from happening again			0
we need accountability for all officers involved that sends a message that this type of brutality is unacceptable and the lives of people of color are equally valued			1
systemic cultural and substantive policy changes in police departments -- particularly in @entity13 -- are needed to ensure black and brown communities are not targeted with overly aggressive , discriminatory " broken windows policing " and " stop and frisk " policies that promote brutality and violence			0
officers should work to understand the communities they work in , not criminalize them			0
police - community relations can only start to improve when individual officers who abuse civilians ' rights are held accountable with a zero - tolerance policy for police brutality			1
anything less is just rhetoric , and i fear that these unjust deaths will continue with more families and communities suffering the same pain .			0

like unarmed @entity9 , @entity249 's son was killed by police in an illegal chokehold
there 's been an *uproar* after an officer in @entity166 shot and killed an unarmed @entity5
@entity249 : police who kill unarmed people of color often get away with slap on *wrist*
@entity14 : justice and good community relations call for zero tolerance for police brutality
