-- to watch @entity2 's powerful " home going " service on saturday was to be reminded that she was a one - of - a - kind talent , with a divine instrument that even in death soared above all the other famous voices that gathered at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 , to celebrate her			1
but sadly , @entity2 was a dime a dozen in another aspect of her life : her dependence on drugs and alcohol			1
as anyone who has struggled with it or had a loved one who did can tell you , addiction does not discriminate based on talent or fame or wealth or race			2
it 's an equal - opportunity curse and killer			2
i know , because i saw my father , another groundbreaking black talent of his time , brought low by it , a tragic story of brilliance and decline and the pain it can inflict on children and family that took me decades to find the strength to tell			0
read more about addiction in the media , celebrity and addiction is all too often served up only as a tabloid cocktail of scandal and gossip			0
but in the wake of @entity2 's death , we at @entity0 have decided to pay one last tribute to her by devoting this week to a series of in depth stories and discussions about what can be done to fight the scourge of addiction			1
we start with chief medical correspondent dr. @entity59			0
in appearances on " @entity61 " with @entity62 and our daytime " @entity64 " shows , he will examine the latest breakthroughs in the brain science and biology of addiction and how they have given rise to promising new anti-substance abuse drugs			2
throughout the week , dr. @entity70 will share his wisdom about the keys to beating addiction and the lessons of @entity2 's fall on his own prime - time show on our sister network , @entity77			1
celebrities and prescription drug addiction we will hear from former addicts about how they turned their lives around , including tv sports anchor @entity83 , who is sitting down with @entity84 , and @entity86 great @entity85 , who is talking to @entity87			0
we will also air a series of stories about the fastest growing form of addiction in @entity92 : prescription drugs , from " gateway pills " like @entity98 to heavy duty painkillers like @entity95 and @entity96			1
as @entity101 correspondent @entity100 reports , the @entity92 military this month announced it would start testing troops for hydrocodone ( the base of @entity95 ) and benzodiazepine , the key ingredient in @entity107			0
when the military , usually the institutional gold standard in dealing with medical and psychological issues , goes that far , you know we have an epidemic on our hands			0
abuse of legal drugs is also an increasing source of accidental deaths , a subject that our medical team plans to follow up on in the coming months			0
none of us needs to wait for @entity2 's toxicology reports to know that more needs to be done to combat the evils that took her from us so soon , or that we all have a responsibility to join the fight .			1

in an in depth series of reports this week , @entity0 looks at addiction
@entity2 's troubled life and death has led to the stories
@entity0 anchors , *experts* , will examine what can be done to fight addiction
