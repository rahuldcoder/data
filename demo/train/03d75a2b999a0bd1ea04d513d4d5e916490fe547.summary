@entity0 -- a @entity3 majority appeared poised tuesday to give a woman convicted of trying to poison her best friend a chance to argue that her case should have been handled in state courts			1
@entity9 was given a longer prison sentence in the federal system , after being charged with violating an international treaty on the use of chemical weapons			1
the case of toxic love has soap - opera elements , but @entity19 's lawyers argued she was being treated like an international terrorist , instead of someone caught up in a domestic dispute			1
several justices seemed to agree			2
" she wants to make the argument that this is a strictly state , local crime , and that any attempt by the federal government to convert it into a treaty - based terrorism crime is erroneous , " said justice @entity24			1
" why does n't she have standing to make that argument ? " justice @entity33 added , " it 's all a question of what @entity36 ' scope of authority is under the ( @entity40 's ) @entity39 " on federal authority			1
the implications go far beyond this case , and could establish important precedents on the strength and purpose of the @entity40 's 10th amendment , which preserves state sovereignty			1
it is also an issue roiling the current political debate , especially among @entity53 conservatives in this post- 9/11 , security - conscious environment			0
at issue is whether @entity19 has a right -- called " standing " -- to contest her conviction on grounds it went far beyond the normal scope of federal jurisdiction in this kind of crime			1
the high court , in a case from more than 70 years ago , suggested that this so - called " gateway " claim could only be raised by state officials , not individual plaintiffs			1
@entity19 , a native of @entity70 , lived outside @entity71 and worked as a microbiologist			1
as a federal appeals court succinctly summarized the relevant facts in the case : " @entity19 was excited when her closest friend , @entity76 , announced she was pregnant			1
@entity19 's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband , @entity79 , was the child 's father			1
" @entity19 , known to her family as @entity83 , struck back by stealing dangerous chemicals -- arsenic - based 10 - chloro - @entity85 - phenoxarsine -- from her company , and also obtained potassium dichromate over the internet			1
both substances in heavy doses can cause toxic , even lethal harm with very little physical contact			0
the 40 - year - old then tried to poison @entity95 some two dozen times over several months , secretly sprinkling small amounts of the chemicals on an apartment doorknob , car door handles and a mailbox			0
while suffering no more than a chemical burn on her thumb , @entity95 grew suspicious -- one of the chemicals was a bright orange powder			0
after getting little help from local police , she called postal inspectors in 2007 , who set up surveillance cameras			0
@entity19 was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and car muffler , court records show			2
@entity19 admitted her guilt early on and claimed she never meant to kill @entity95 , but only wanted to cause her " an uncomfortable rash			2
" the defendant also said her friend 's betrayal caused an " emotional breakdown " that made her respond in such a shocking fashion			2
instead of being charged with simple assault , which may have gotten her six months to a year or two in state prison , @entity19 was indicted in federal court on two counts of mail fraud and two counts of violating a federal law and international treaty for the possession and use of " chemical weapons			1
" when a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court , @entity19 pleaded guilty and immediately appealed			1
she received a sentence of six years behind bars and nearly $ 12,000 in fines and restitution			0
an appeals court ultimately rejected her standing claims			0
the strange case took an even stranger turn when the @entity3 was asked to weigh in			0
after first adamantly claiming @entity19 had no right to appeal , the @entity147 reversed course			2
but the @entity151 administration still believes @entity19 's federal conviction was valid			1
in court arguments , the standing issue dominated the debate			0
" this is n't sarin , " a lethal nerve agent terrorists have used in the past against civilians , said @entity19 's attorney @entity160			1
" there is something sort of odd about the government 's theory that says that i can buy a chemical ' weapon ' at @entity168			2
that strikes me as odd			0
" he added @entity19 used a " commonly available chemical			1
" that received a sympathetic response from some on the court after @entity160 's legal opponent stepped up			0
" if it is in fact a 10th @entity180 claim , unless you have a state official or the state , there is no standing , " said attorney @entity177			2
" @entity187 harsh , if we 're talking about prudential standing , to deny that to a criminal defendant , is n't it ? " replied chief justice @entity186			0
" your underlying premise is that the individual has no interest in whether or not the state has surrendered its powers to the federal government , and i just do n't think the @entity40 was framed on that theory , " he said			2
justice @entity202 pushed @entity177 to admit there was no previous high court case in which a criminal defendant was held to have lacked standing to challenge a statute under which the defendant was prosecuted			2
since the @entity208 admitted its handling of the standing issue was wrong , the justices had to appoint an outside private attorney to argue what the government had originally claimed			1
@entity177 , an experienced lawyer and onetime law clerk to justice @entity216 , was given the tough assignment			0
many conservatives hoped the majority right - leaning bench would use the opportunity to delve further into the scope of the 10th amendment , which states , " the powers not delegated to the @entity225 by the @entity40 , nor prohibited by it to the states , are reserved to the states respectively , or to the people			0
" while some justices thought the case should be decided only on standing grounds , others were more eager to explore the larger issues			1
@entity151 administration attorney @entity235 argued @entity36 ' power to enforce treaties and to control commerce was sweeping , including state " regulation of a commodity			0
" " given the breadth of this statute , that would be a very far - reaching decision , would n't it ? " said justice @entity242 , clearly troubled			0
by the federal government 's reading , he noted , " a chemical weapon is a weapon that includes toxic chemicals			1
and a toxic chemical is a chemical that can cause death to animals			0
and pouring vinegar in a goldfish bowl , i believe , will cause death to the goldfish , so that 's a chemical weapon , " which could potentially mean life imprisonment for the perpetrator			2
he suggested that was not what @entity36 had intended			0
in the broader political context , conservatives , along with a healthy mix of liberals and libertarians , worry that the federal government and @entity36 have been overly aggressive in staking claims to disputes they believe are best left to states , especially in the criminal arena			0
and it 's not just felonies			0
areas like gun ownership , zoning laws , environmental regulations , taxation , health care and education standards all could be re-examined in the wake of a high court decision			0
even if @entity19 prevails on the standing issue , she might still face an uphill battle in phase two of the her legal fight , getting her federal conviction ultimately thrown out on 10th amendment grounds			1
either way , it may come too late to do her any good , if the justices sidestep the 10th amendment aspects			0
she is set to be freed from federal prison in @entity299 next year , likely before any future case on the merits would be resolved			2
a high court ruling will likely be issued by june			0
the case is @entity19 v. @entity225 ( 09 - 1227 ) .			1

the case involves a woman convicted of federal charges related to chemical weapons
@entity19 found out her husband and best friend were having an affair , and a baby
justices mull @entity19 's standing to argue that her case should have been decided in state courts
