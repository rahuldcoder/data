-- funny thing about fish : you can see right through them in their infancy and watch their organs develop			0
that gave scientists looking into the aftereffects of 2010 's @entity13 oil spill the chance to watch the growing hearts of large commercial species like tuna and amberjack after exposing them in laboratories to oil collected from the undersea blowout			1
the results ranged from abnormal heartbeats in fish exposed to low concentrations of oil to " severely malformed and malfunctioning hearts " at high levels , said @entity29 , an environmental toxicologist from the @entity30			1
@entity29 is the lead author of a @entity30 - led study published monday that warned those heart defects could lead to widespread losses of popular deep - sea fish in the gulf			1
he and his colleagues exposed bluefin tuna , yellowfin tuna and amberjack embryos to concentrations of oil " that mimicked what happened in the @entity13 , " he said			1
even where the volatile compounds in oil made up as little as one millionth of a gram per liter , some fish ended up with heart problems , they reported			0
" those fish would in all likelihood survive the immediate effects of oil exposure , but would also probably end up with a milder heart malformation that could reduce their aerobic performance -- which for fish , means swimming , " @entity29 said			1
fishermen hauled in more than 1,500 tons of tuna and amberjack across the gulf in 2012 , according to @entity30 catch statistics			2
scientists have already tracked a sharp decline in bluefin tuna , but the findings may spell trouble for other big fish as well , @entity29 and his colleagues reported			1
how extensive any losses may be is still under study , but estimates may come " in a few months , " said @entity71 , a @entity72 biologist and co-author of monday 's study			0
the spill struck at a time when fish were spawning , with their embryos and larvae floating on the surface of the gulf			2
since bluefin tuna in particular take eight years or more to grow up , the " the trickle - down impact of this oil spill will take a long time to manifest upon the population on a level that one could see , " @entity71 said			1
the study was published in the peer - reviewed journal @entity91 on the 25th anniversary of what had been the worst @entity95 oil spill -- the 1989 @entity96 in @entity97			1
it 's one of the " key studies " commissioned by the federal government to gauge the damage left behind by the @entity104 disaster , @entity30 official @entity98 said			2
" it 's one of the most difficult aspects of this oil spill to the particular population that we 're talking about , " @entity71 said			0
but since bluefin have been extensively tagged electronically , both before and after the spill , " those data sets exist , and they 're currently being explored to get answers to those questions			0
" millions of barrels of crude poured into the gulf after the april 2010 explosion that sank the drill rig @entity104 off @entity120 and killed 11 workers			2
well owner @entity122 has already paid $ 43 billion in cleanup , restoration costs and fines for the 2010 blowout , and an ongoing federal court case in @entity129 could add several billion more on top of that			2
@entity122 immediately disputed monday 's findings			0
" the paper provides no evidence to suggest a population - level impact on tuna , amberjack or other pelagic fish species in the @entity13 , " the company said in a written statement			1
" the oil concentrations used in these lab experiments were rarely seen in the gulf during or after the @entity104 accident			1
in addition , the authors themselves note that it is nearly impossible to determine the early life impact to these species			0
to overcome this challenge , it would take more information than what 's presented in this paper			0
" but @entity156 , an environmental toxicologist at @entity157 , said the samples to which the embryos were exposed were " environmentally realistic			0
" the effects seen in individual fish " have very strong indications for population - level impacts , " he said			0
" you mess up the heart , you mess up the ability of species like this to do simple functions like swim to catch its prey , " said @entity156 , the co-author of a 2013 study that pointed to similar problems among fish in coastal marshes hit by oil			0
@entity122 also disputed those findings			0
opinion : after 25 years , @entity96 has n't ended more about oil spills @entity180 pleads guilty in 2010 @entity104 case			1

study : @entity13 oil exposure causes " severely malformed ' hearts in tuna , amberjack
the report may spell trouble for big , deep - water commercial fish
the research is part of the damage report after the 2010 @entity104 spill
@entity122 says the oil levels used in the study " were rarely seen in the gulf "
