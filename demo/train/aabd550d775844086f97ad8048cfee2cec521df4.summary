a documentary on the 1996 explosion that brought down @entity4 offers " solid proof that there was an external detonation , " its co-producer said wednesday			1
" of course , everyone knows about the eyewitness statements , but we also have corroborating information from the radar data , and the radar data shows a ( n ) asymmetric explosion coming out of that plane -- something that did n't happen in the official theory , " @entity8 told @entity10 's @entity9			2
all 230 people aboard @entity4 died when the plane , headed for @entity24 , exploded and crashed into the @entity25 shortly after takeoff from @entity27 in @entity28			1
scores of witnesses observed a streak of light and a fireball , giving early rise to suspicions that terrorists had struck the plane with a rocket			2
investigators concluded the streak was likely burning fuel streaming from the plane 's wing tank			1
the @entity43 ruled that the explosion was caused by an electrical short circuit , most likely originating in a fuel gauge line , which found its way into the center wing fuel tank , where it detonated fuel vapors and caused the @entity51 to fall in pieces into the waters off @entity54			1
but some people have come forward , " all saying the same thing : that there was an external force -- not from the center wing tank , there 's no evidence of that -- but there is evidence of an external explosion that brought down that plane , " @entity8 said			1
he cited " corroborating information from the radar data " and complained that " not one single eyewitness was allowed to testify -- that 's unheard of			2
" " the family members need to know what happened to their loved ones , " he said			2
asked why such information might have been suppressed , @entity8 said , " that 's a question that should be answered when this investigation gets reopened			2
" possibility of a review of new information the @entity43 acknowledged receipt wednesday of the filmmakers ' petition -- signed by former investigators -- requesting that the investigation be reopened			1
" as required by @entity43 regulation , a petition for reconsideration of @entity43 findings or a probable cause determination must be based on the discovery of new evidence or on a showing that the @entity43 's findings are erroneous , " said board spokeswoman @entity85			1
what really happened " we assign petition responses to the relevant modal office for drafting			2
the @entity43 's @entity99 will assign staff , to the maximum extent practicable , who did not work on the original investigation to carefully prepare a response			1
the response will be presented to the full board for their consideration and vote			0
" the board 's investigation of @entity4 lasted four years and " remains one of the @entity43 's most extensive investigations , " @entity85 said			1
investigators " spent an enormous amount of time reviewing , documenting and analyzing facts and data and held a five - day public hearing to gather additional facts before determining the probable cause of the accident , " she said			0
but she left open the possibility the case will be reopened			0
" while the @entity43 rarely re-investigates issues that have already been examined , our investigations are never closed , and we can review any new information not previously considered by board , " she said			1
one @entity4 family member reacted to the news of the documentary with skepticism			1
" some of the people involved in this group have been involved in @entity143 conspiracy theories for the last 15 years , " said @entity133 , whose wife , @entity135 , and two daughters , @entity137 , 10 , and @entity138 , 8 , died in the incident			0
" so far as i can tell , this is just a rehash of what 's been out on the @entity143 , " he said			0
" if they have no new information and this is just trumped - up stuff that 's been out there forever , yes , it is hurtful , " @entity133 said			0
" why go through this again			0
conversely , if they do have new information and it 's provable , it 's a game changer			0
i will watch this thing with a very critical eye , knowing what i know			0
" @entity159 , a member of the five - person @entity43 during the investigation , said he " took offense " at the filmmakers ' suggestion that board members ignored evidence			1
" i would never be part of any coverup -- period , " he told @entity10			0
" this accident , this report , over 50,000 pages , if you take and just look at certain pieces of it , you can move the cause of this accident any way you want			0
you can take just the radar ; you can say it was a missile			0
you have to take all of the pieces and look at them as a whole			0
" the sequencing report that told how the airplane fell apart , none of it supports a missile -- none of it			0
when you look at the physical evidence inside the tank , it 's clear that there was an explosion inside the tank			1
if the top of the tank goes up and the bottom of the tank goes down , and the forward side goes forward and the back of the tank goes back , that tells you that the blast was inside the tank -- not outside			1
" he said that no holes were found in the tank that would indicate something had penetrated it			2
but the documentary asserts that a missile may have exploded adjacent to the plane			0
critics challenge government investigation skeptics have long theorized that @entity4 was brought down by sinister forces			1
they include @entity217 , who served as a senior accident investigator with the @entity43 and helped reconstruct the aircraft			1
others include @entity221 , a @entity223 investigator who participated in the investigation , and @entity225 , an accident investigator for the @entity226			1
" these investigators were not allowed to speak to the public or refute any comments made by their superiors and / or @entity43 and @entity234 officials about their work at the time of the official investigation , " a news release announcing the documentary said			2
" they waited until after retirement to reveal how the official conclusion by the ( @entity43 ) was falsified and lay out their case			2
" @entity241 , who headed the @entity234 's investigation into the explosion , dismissed suggestions that investigators concealed information and were not receptive to clues			2
" if they felt that way back then , they could have come to me , " @entity241 said			0
" i was someone desiring to get to the bottom of this , believe me			0
and i had a reputation for not , you know , for not pussyfooting around			0
yet it seems like they 've comfortably waited until they have their pensions before they became whistle - blowers			0
so i think it 's a bunch of bullcrap			0
" the documentary , " @entity4 , " will premiere july 17 , the 17th anniversary of the crash			1
@entity8 is co-founder of the @entity265 and has been a longtime and passionate critic of the official investigation			0
suspicions that criminals or terrorists were behind the @entity4 explosion are not new			1
the @entity234 conducted a parallel investigation , but concluded that the incident was not a crime or terrorist attack			0
the @entity43 said tuesday that it was aware of the pending release of the documentary , which will air on @entity280 tv network , and of the producers ' intent to file a petition to reopen the investigation			2
the documentarians said they have a " trifecta of elements " that will " prove that the officially proposed fuel - air explosion did not cause the crash			1
" that trifecta includes forensic evidence , firsthand sources and corroborating witnesses , and the new statements from retired investigators			2
the evidence proves that " one or more ordnance explosions outside the aircraft caused the crash , " the producers said			1
but it does not identify or speculate on the source of the ordnance explosions			1
