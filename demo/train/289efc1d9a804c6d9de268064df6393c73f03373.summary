@entity0 , @entity1 -- they could probably smell him coming for miles			2
circus performers @entity7 and @entity8 with their son , @entity9			1
" breakfast , boys , " @entity8 proclaimed as his cats jumped with excitement in their cages			2
@entity8 set down his wheelbarrow , filled with @entity17 beef			2
using a pitchfork , he fed his bengal tigers			2
it 's the morning ritual at @entity21			0
@entity8 is the show 's tiger trainer			1
he 's a fifth - generation circus performer from @entity24			1
on this morning , the show awakes in @entity0 , @entity1			0
" you get up in the morning ; you wash the animal , clean it up ; you feed them , then you play with them a bit , " @entity8 said			0
" and then during the day , you spend some time with your family			1
" he lives in a trailer with his family so he can stay close to the tigers			1
he , wife @entity7 and son @entity9 are all on a two - year tour with @entity21 but why would anyone live on the road like this , with a 4 - year - old ? @entity7 is also part of the circus , performing an aerial ballet , hanging by her hair high above the crowds , just like her mother and grandmother , who taught her the act			1
" i can finish my act and then go up and see my son , so it 's good , ' cause we 're always together , " @entity49 said			1
the @entity54 keep a home in @entity1 but are rarely there			0
" home is actually my trailer , when we travel , and have dinner every night and watch tv			1
that 's really my home , " @entity60 said			0
and these lives on wheels come with real family needs			1
just outside @entity67 at @entity0 's @entity68 , across from the @entity70 - go @entity69 and @entity72 food stands , school is in session			1
@entity74 is a licensed teacher with the circus			1
he uses a nationally recognized home - schooling curriculum			1
he pitches a one - room schoolhouse in every city where the show pitches its tent , for all of the school - age children of the circus			1
school is open five days a week			1
he teaches all the subjects , and every one of his students gets personal attention			0
" i would describe it as a rigorous curriculum , " he said			0
" we do n't want to allow anything to slip through the cracks because we 're traveling			1
this is a real school			1
" @entity74 added , " if i was teaching in a public high school , i could have 120 students			1
that 's a lot less opportunity to really address what each student needs			0
" @entity99 is one of the students			0
the 8 - year - old is growing up quickly , surrounded by circus people from 32 countries			1
one of the performers is teaching her @entity105			0
she says she likes to wash the elephants , and she loves the travel			2
" you can see all these different places and what it looks like , and i also wanted to know what each state looked like , so i get to do it , " she said			0
@entity99 's dad is @entity116 , the general manager			1
with his wife , @entity118 , and son @entity117 , 3 , he hits about 36 cities a year			1
when @entity2 arrived at his temporary office at the @entity0 arena , @entity99 was reading with @entity116			0
@entity117 was with @entity123 , playing a " @entity126 " game on the computer			1
" this is a 24/7 job , so i make time pretty much every day to sit with my kids , go out with my kids , " @entity116 said			0
the @entity130 , like most of the 350 circus members , live on a train , with all of a home 's amenities			2
but finding a park or a playground is a must for them			0
" i have a house in @entity140			0
i probably see it once a year , maybe for a week or two , " @entity116 said			2
" but , more or less , we travel on the train			2
it 's year - round , basically			1
... so really , home is wherever the circus takes me			2
" one disadvantage is that the kids do not have a lot of friends to play with			0
but the family is always together			2
" i think there 's a lot of people who travel for their jobs , that are not fortunate enough to travel with family , where this job allows us to be able to do that , " @entity152 said			1
the @entity130 believe that their lives and the lives of their children have been enhanced by the real - world learning experiences			1
" instead of just reading it in books , they 're going to see these things , and to me , that 's more fulfilling , " @entity116 explained			0
citing privacy reasons , the circus did not allow @entity2 to see the train			2
with any traveling family , there will inevitably be spiritual needs			1
sister @entity176 is a full - time circus worker and @entity178 nun who holds religion classes , working across cultures , sharing the circus lifestyle			1
" i saw that these people needed to find that they too were a parish , that they too were a community , " she explained			0
" we can support and walk with each other in this journey that we call life			2
" @entity176 arranges for clergy to visit the circus weekly			2
she 's a former missionary who spent 16 years in @entity190			0
here , she says , she hopes to be a biblical presence amid the glitzy backdrop and colorful characters , from acrobats to clowns to animal trainers			0
" some come asking for bible study			0
some come forward and say , ' my child needs the sacrament , with confession and communion			0
can you help me ? ' of course i can , " she explained			0
for about two years , @entity176 also worked backstage , opening and closing the curtain between acts , for 800 shows in two years			0
she remembers those times as " @entity212 moments			0
" " they knew that i 'd be there , and they would just come over and in the darkened area just talk to me about whatever they wanted to talk , and wonderful things happened			0
wonderful spiritual things happened , just because i was there , " she said			0
and although things may sometimes seem , quite literally , a bit upside down here , it 's just life under the big top at the greatest show on @entity228 .			2
