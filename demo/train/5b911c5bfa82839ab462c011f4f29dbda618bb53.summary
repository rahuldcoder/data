@entity0 -- top @entity2 and congressional negotiators failed to reach agreement tuesday on a spending plan for the rest of the current fiscal year , bringing the federal government closer to a shutdown at the end of the week			1
@entity11 rejected a @entity13 proposal to keep the government running for one more week at the cost of an additional $ 12 billion in cuts			2
republicans , meanwhile , dismissed @entity11 ' insistence that there had been an agreement to cut $ 33 billion for the rest of the fiscal year			2
if there is no deal by midnight friday , when the current spending authorization measure expires , parts of the government will close down			1
later tuesday , senate majority leader @entity26 and @entity2 speaker @entity27 met privately to discuss the matter			1
statements issued by each of their offices described the talks as " productive " and said they agreed to continue working to find a solution			1
the budget brinksmanship showed the political stakes of the situation , with both parties trying to depict the other as unwilling to do what 's right for the country			2
republicans , under pressure from the conservative @entity43 movement for deep cuts that will reduce the size of government , blame @entity11 for failing to pass a fiscal year 2011 budget last year when they controlled both congressional chambers and say that president @entity49 and his party are ignoring the peril of the rising federal deficits and national debt			1
@entity11 contend that spending cuts sought by @entity55 in response to the @entity43 movement pressure will harm economic recovery and slash education and innovation programs essential for continued growth			0
@entity49 and @entity26 , @entity62 , both insisted tuesday that @entity11 are agreeing to more than 50 % of the spending cuts sought by @entity13 , which they said should be sufficient for a compromise on an issue that has little overall effect on the deficit and debt issues			1
@entity49 discussed the growing budget crisis behind closed doors at the @entity2 with key @entity2 and @entity73 leaders			1
the president met with two republicans , @entity27 and @entity77 chairman @entity76 of @entity78 , and two democrats , @entity26 and @entity81 chairman @entity80 of @entity82			1
the president then made an unannounced appearance in the @entity2 briefing room to tell reporters that @entity27 and @entity26 would meet on their own later in the day			1
@entity49 said that if the two men failed to make progress on their own , he expected them to return to the @entity2 on wednesday			1
and " if that does n't work , we 'll invite them again the day after that , " the president promised			0
" there 's no reason why we should not get this done			0
" the administration will put in " whatever resources are required in terms of time and energy " to reach an agreement , @entity49 said			1
but what " we ca n't do is have a ' my way or the highway ' approach to this problem , " he added			0
" if we start applying that approach ... we 're not going to get anything done			0
" @entity49 also said he could support one more short - term funding extension to avert a partial shutdown , but only if a deal is reached on spending for the rest of the current fiscal year , which ends september 30			0
he and @entity26 rejected the @entity13 proposal for a seven - day extension that would include $ 12 billion in spending cuts while providing the military with funding for the rest of the fiscal year , but @entity26 added he would consider amending the measure if it reached the @entity73 in time for action before the current spending resolution expires			2
@entity26 also said @entity2 @entity13 should start doing " what the country needs , not what the @entity43 wants , " noting the @entity125 - controlled @entity73 rejected a @entity2 spending bill favored by conservatives that would cut $ 61 billion in discretionary spending this fiscal year			1
@entity11 consider that bill draconian , complaining that , among other things , it would cut key programs for continued economic recovery while eliminating funding for others opposed by conservatives , such as @entity136 and @entity137			0
@entity27 , meanwhile , insisted @entity2 @entity13 would n't let @entity138 and the @entity2 put them " in a box " by forcing them to choose between a government shutdown or continued government funding with insufficient spending cuts			1
" we want the largest spending cuts that are possible , " said @entity27 , @entity143			2
" we 're going to continue to fight for those			0
" @entity27 also said he would not drop the @entity13 's insistence on including provisions relating to hot - button social issues such as abortion , calling them important to his conservative caucus			2
@entity11 oppose the so - called " policy riders " in the spending bill			0
the speaker cast aside assertions by @entity49 and @entity26 that they had already given the @entity13 over half of what it initially wanted in terms of cuts , saying the @entity11 were using " smoke and mirrors to get there			2
" " our goal is to keep the government open , " @entity27 insisted			1
" we have no interest in the government shutting down , but we are interested in cutting spending			0
" as the potential for a shutdown grew , an aide to @entity27 said the lawmaker also told @entity172 chairman @entity171 , @entity173 , to issue guidance to all members on how the @entity2 would operate in the event of a government shutdown			1
meanwhile , the @entity179 @entity178 posted information about how a shutdown would affect federal employees on its website tuesday			2
the posting said that most federal workers paid with funds appropriated by @entity187 will go on temporary furlough in the event of a shutdown			1
it would be up to @entity187 to decide if furloughed workers get paid for the work time missed when the shutdown ends , the posting said			1
health benefits continue if the shutdown lasts for less than a year , it said			0
a senior @entity125 source with knowledge of the ongoing negotiations said the biggest obstacle to a deal involves whether reductions in mandatory spending programs , known in appropriations parlance as " changes in @entity206 " or chimps , should be part of spending cuts			0
examples of mandatory spending programs include @entity213 grants , the @entity214 and some types of highway funding			0
such programs are funded for multiple years at a time , with the spending set for the time period covered , exempt from congressional authorization each year			0
according to the senior @entity125 source , the chiefs of staff to @entity80 and @entity76 negotiated throughout the weekend , and the gap between them is about $ 8 billion to $ 10 billion			0
@entity125 sources said they want about half the overall cuts in this spending bill to come from mandatory spending programs , and that they have proposed the necessary reductions in programs at the @entity179 @entity230 , the @entity231 , the @entity232 and @entity233			0
republicans , who want any spending cuts to reflect a reduction in the size of government , note that reducing the spending in a mandatory program for one year does n't prevent the amount from returning to its original level the following year			0
@entity1 's @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 contributed to this report			0

new : federal workers paid by appropriated funds will be furloughed in a shutdown
@entity26 and @entity27 meet and agree to keep working on a solution
@entity2 , congressional budget negotiations fail to reach an agreement
