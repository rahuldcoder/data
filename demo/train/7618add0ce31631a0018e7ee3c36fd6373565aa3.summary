-- is there an unspoken rule in @entity3 that celebrity parents can only pick unusual names for their kids ? on @entity8 on sunday , @entity7 revealed that she and partner @entity9 went with @entity10 as the name of their third child , a boy they welcomed on december 14			1
over the weekend , @entity16 and @entity17 welcomed their second child , a daughter they named @entity22			0
and that 's after the arrival earlier this year of @entity25 , the daughter of rapper @entity27 , and @entity28 , the son of @entity29 and @entity30			0
all of those names are obviously precious to the parents who picked them , but they 're not exactly the equivalent of monikers such as @entity36 or @entity37 , which according to @entity38 , were the top two baby names in 2014			2
not every celebrity picks the most unusual name they can think of -- @entity44 and @entity45 , for example , welcomed daughter @entity46 this year -- but most of the time it seems the famous are competing in some sort of special baby - name @entity51			0
here are some of the more distinct baby names we 've heard of this year -- who do you think had the most unique ? .			1

@entity7 named son @entity10
