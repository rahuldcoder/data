-- a teenage girl may have gotten lost in a cave looking for water , nearly 13,000 years ago			1
@entity4 , as she 's known today , likely fell to her death in a deep , dark pit			2
now , her remains are shining a light on the genetic heritage of what we believe are the first people in the @entity13			1
researchers have discovered @entity4 's bones in a pit in an underwater cave system in @entity19 's @entity18			1
her skeleton , described in the journal @entity22 this week , is one of the oldest of any humans found in the @entity13			1
she comes from a group of ancient people anthropologists call @entity28			2
genetic analysis of her remains suggests that @entity4 is related to modern @entity30			1
it 's a clue to resolving the issue of whether the group we call native americans are indeed related to the first settlers of this land mass. this study promotes the view that " @entity30 and @entity28 share a homeland , " said @entity41 of @entity42 , who was the lead author of the study			1
that homeland is called @entity45 , also called the @entity45 , that connected what is now @entity47 and @entity48			1
the new research goes against the idea that the first @entity30 may have come over in separate migrations from @entity52 and @entity53			1
other genetic evidence from both modern @entity30 and ancient skeletons indicates that people of @entity47 landed in eastern @entity45 between 26,000 and 18,000 years ago , the study said			1
they seem to have moved south after 17,000 years ago			2
so how do we know who this girl was ? @entity4 's genetic lineage was analyzed through mitochondrial dna			0
this is genetic material that is passed from mothers to children , and is stored in the mitochondria , a part of a cell that is essential for energy production and is sometimes thought of as a " power plant			0
" scientists are able to characterize genetic lineages by looking at mitochondrial dna			0
it 's important to note , however , that this does not reveal as much information about a person 's heritage as nuclear dna , which is stored in the cell 's nucleus and contains material from both parents			0
researchers are planning to look at @entity4 's nuclear dna also , @entity41 said			0
researchers found that the 12,000 - to 13,000 - year - old teenager 's mitochondrial dna belongs to @entity91 , a category only found in the @entity13 these days but which originally came from an @entity94 lineage			1
some @entity96 populations today have this genetic signature : 29 % of indigenous people of @entity99 and @entity100 have it ; so do 11 % of @entity30 , said @entity101 , assistant professor of anthropology at the @entity103			1
through her maternal line , the girl in the cave seems to have been related to modern @entity30 as well as their ancestors , @entity101 said			1
why does n't she look like @entity30 ? but wait -- @entity4 's physical features are very different from that of modern day @entity30			1
flat , broad faces with flaring cheekbones , and short , round heads are typical of @entity30 , @entity41 said			1
by contrast , @entity4 had an angular head , and a small , relatively narrow face			0
@entity4 's features are more similar to other ancient populations and isolated hunter - gatherer populations in such places as the @entity122 , @entity41 said			0
" @entity28 -- those earliest people with the distinctive skull and facial features -- could have come from @entity47 too , " @entity101 said			1
" it therefore seems more likely that differences between @entity28 and @entity30 today are due to evolutionary changes that occurred in @entity45 and the @entity13 over the last 9,000 years			1
" some scientists believe a population entered @entity45 , became geographically isolated , and then experienced evolutionary changes in their mitochondrial dna during several thousand years , @entity41 said			1
from there , multiple migrations may have taken people out of @entity45 and to the @entity13			1
" what this study is presenting for the first time is the evidence that paleoamericans with those distinctive features can also be directly tied to the same @entity141 source population as contemporary @entity30 , " @entity101 said			1
facial features may have evolved over time in response to such factors as changing climates and diets , @entity41 said			0
@entity28 also have characteristics such as facial projection -- features such as mouth and eyes protruding from the skull -- that are related to aggression , a behavior that would be favorable in a migrating population , @entity41 said			0
as groups settle down , however , docility tends to be advantageous			0
why was @entity4 at the bottom of a pit ? the near - complete skeleton , dated to between 12,000 and 13,000 years old , was discovered in a pit that lies in an underwater cave system in a crevice the jungle floor about five miles from the @entity165			1
traversing through a flooded tunnel , divers discovered this chamber that was so dark it seemed to absorb their underwater lights , @entity166 of @entity167 said at a press conference			2
they called it @entity174 , which means @entity176 in @entity177			0
" the floor disappeared under us , and we could not see across to the other side			0
we pointed our lights down and to the sides			0
all we could see was darkness , " said @entity183 , who is the co-director and lead diver for the @entity185			0
@entity183 's team found many of @entity4 's bones , as well as " a small cranium laying upside down with a perfect set of teeth and dark eye sockets looking back at us			2
" they made this discovery in 2007			0
most of the bones are still underwater , @entity41 said			2
scientists conducted the dna analysis and age estimate based on one of @entity4 's wisdom teeth			0
" recently , to protect the skull and some bones damaged by unauthorized visitors , we recovered them from the cave , but studies of those pieces have not yet begun , " he said			2
this cave site was probably dry until about 10,000 years ago , when it flooded because of glacial melting , researchers said			2
there is evidence from the way that the bones are distributed in the cave , and iron oxide on the walls , that it contained " an ephemeral pool of water " that may have been filled by storms , @entity41 said			2
we may never know why @entity4 died , but @entity41 said it looks like she took a great fall into the pit , fracturing her pelvis			0
she would not have entered the cave system through a crevice in the jungle , as the divers did , but rather from a ground - level entrance , as the " ground " was lower than it is today			2
the name @entity4 comes from the @entity238 word for " water nymph , " researchers said			0
even if we do n't know what she called herself , further investigation may uncover more about her roots and life			0

study suggests first @entity30 came from @entity45
@entity45 was a land mass between @entity47 and @entity48
skeletal remains were found in underwater cave in @entity19
