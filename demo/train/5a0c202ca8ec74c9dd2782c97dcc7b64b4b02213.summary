-- @entity2 authorities on saturday detailed the charges pending against a self - proclaimed porn star , accusing him of first - degree murder in the grisly killing and dismembering of a university student and threatening , among others , @entity10 's prime minister			1
the suspect -- 29 - year - old @entity11 -- remains at large despite a massive international manhunt			1
the search for him began after a severed hand and foot were mailed to the @entity18 headquarters of @entity10 's @entity20 and @entity21 parties , while a torso was discovered stuffed in a suitcase and tossed in the trash heap of a @entity2 apartment building			2
what specific accusations he would face if he 's captured became clearer saturday , when police in @entity2 released information from his arrest warrant			1
besides murder , the charges include producing , distributing or possessing " any obscene written matter , picture , model ... or other thing , " mailing " anything that is obscene , indecent , immoral or scurrilous , " and " improperly or indecently ( offering ) any indignity to a dead human body or human remains			1
" the accusations relate to the violent death of a @entity45 student from @entity46			1
@entity2 police commander @entity47 identified the victim friday as 33 - year - old @entity50			2
the @entity46 consulate in @entity2 said @entity50 was from the central @entity46 city of @entity53			1
police believe @entity50 was killed and his body dismembered either on may 24 or 25 in a @entity2 apartment			1
a 10 - minute video showing what transpired was then posted online			0
" we believe he filmed himself , " @entity47 said earlier this week of the suspect			0
" it 's gross ... this is a very deranged person			0
he is looking for attention and he got it , but not in a positive way			0
" according to a more detailed copy of the arrest warrant posted on the website of @entity71 , the fifth charge of " uttering threats " accuses @entity11 of " causing ( prime minister ) @entity74 and members of parliament to reasonably fear for their safety			1
" @entity74 is the leader of the @entity21 , one of the offices that had body parts mailed to it			1
@entity11 , who was born as @entity11 and also uses the alias @entity11 , fled by plane from @entity2 to @entity84 , @entity47 has said			1
that prompted @entity86 , the global police agency , to alert authorities in 190 countries			2
police have reason to believe @entity11 might have gone to @entity84 , given his @entity92 pseudonym and writings on his web page			1
on friday , police had indications that the suspect may have been aboard a flight traveling from @entity99 to @entity2			2
yet there was no sign of him after a search of the plane , @entity47 said			0
having earlier indicated that @entity11 is good at disguising himself , the police commander said saturday that the suspect could now be anywhere in @entity84 , though authorities have n't ruled out the possibility he may be back in @entity10			1
police described @entity11 as being 5 feet , 8 inches tall and about 135 pounds , with black hair and blue eyes			1
his name may not have been known before this week , but his digital footprints were large			0
he was notorious among online animal rights activists , who pegged him as a serial kitten killer who used cat carcasses in sexual acts			0
a @entity119 group started in december 2010 dubbed him the " @entity125 , " after a video was posted on @entity122 showing kittens being killed by suffocation and drowning			2
" members of this group have spent over a year searching for this individual , who we believe is also responsible for several videos where animals were killed , " the group said thursday			0
" information gathered by group members was passed on to the authorities in @entity10 , and we were informed that they were actively working on locating the person seen in the videos hurting animals			0
" @entity47 has said police are aware of the animal abuse allegations			0
on what appears to be his own website , @entity11 defended himself as a victim of cyberstalking			2
" once and for all , i will set the record straight , " he wrote			0
" many hoax websites are created using my image and name , posing as me to seem more believable in respect to the type of audience these website ( sic ) have , i feel i do n't need to list them specifically but people need not be told , not to believe what they read and to take it as fact			0
" the website has writing in @entity158 and @entity92 , and shows images of @entity11 half - naked and with lips in a distinct runway pout			2
@entity47 from the @entity2 police expressed confidence that @entity11 will be caught sooner or later -- predicting his desire for attention may be his downfall			1
" this man uses the @entity168 to glorify himself , and ( authorities ) hope this habit will lead to his capture , " the police commander said saturday			0
@entity0 's @entity172 in @entity173 contributed to this report .			0

a warrant notes that police want him arrested on 5 charges , including murder
he caused " @entity74 and ( *lawmakers* ) to reasonably fear for their safety , " it says
