-- the highest court in @entity2 tuesday struck down down life sentences without parole for juveniles as unconstitutional , ruling that applying such sentences against minors was " strikingly similar , in many respects , to the death penalty			1
" the decision by the @entity11 comes one year after the @entity13 @entity12 ruled that two men convicted of killings committed when they were 14 could not be sentenced to life in prison without parole			2
the nation 's highest court said the sentences violated the " principle of proportionality , and so violate the @entity23 's ban on cruel and unusual punishment			1
" in @entity2 , the court ruled that " the imposition of a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole for the commission of murder in the first degree by a juvenile under the age of eighteen is disproportionate not with respect to the offense itself , but with regard to the particular offender			1
" since the brain of a juvenile is not fully formed , a judge could not make an accurate determination on whether the minor is " irretrievably depraved			1
" " simply put , because the brain of a juvenile is not fully developed , either structurally or functionally , by the age of eighteen , a judge can not find with confidence that a particular offender , at that point in time , is irretrievably depraved , the court said			1
the decision stems from the case of @entity52 , who was 17 when he stabbed @entity53 nine times near @entity55 in @entity56 in 1981			0
@entity52 was convicted of first - degree murder and sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole			0
the court ruled @entity52 , who has served 31 years in prison , was eligible to be considered for parole			0
the court also ruled in the separate case of @entity66 , who was tried and convicted last year of first - degree murder in the killing of @entity69			0
the slaying happened in 2009 , when @entity66 was 17			0
@entity66 was awaiting trial when the @entity13 @entity12 made its 2012 ruling in @entity73 v. @entity74 , which affirmed recent high court rulings against harsh criminal sentences			2
" when considered in the context of the offender 's age and the wholesale forfeiture of all liberties , the imposition of a sentence of life without parole on a juvenile homicide offender is strikingly similar , in many respects , to the death penalty , which this court has determined is unconstitutional , " the @entity2 court wrote citing " current scientific evidence , " the judge wrote that the " discretionary imposition of a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole on juveniles ... under the age of eighteen when they commit murder in the first degree violates the prohibition against ' cruel or unusual punishment			1
' " the @entity13 @entity12 in 2005 banned the death penalty for those under 18 who commit aggravated murder			1
then , five years later , the justices said juveniles found guilty of non-homicides could not receive life without parole			0
the rulings put the spotlight on the youngest of killers and the question of whether a national consensus has developed to treat them differently regarding a lifetime of incarceration			0
at the time of high court ruling , about 2,500 prisoners were serving life sentences without parole for crimes committed as juveniles			2
at least 79 of those were 14 years or younger at the time , according to the @entity125 .			0

@entity2 court *equates* life terms for minors , " in many respects , " to the death penalty
court reasons that judges ca *n't* determine whether a juvenile is " irretrievably depraved "
ruling : imposing such sentences violates @entity23 *protections*
