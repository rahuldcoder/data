@entity0 -- two @entity5 doctors treated @entity7 's insomnia with propofol 12 years before he died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic , his former wife testified wednesday			1
@entity11 , who is the mother of @entity7 's two oldest children , is being forced to testify about the singer 's drug use by lawyers for @entity16 , the concert promoter being sued by members of @entity7 's family , who say the promoter is responsible for his death			1
doctors " would try to outbid " each other on who could give @entity7 " the better drug " for his pain , @entity11 testified wednesday			1
@entity18 matriarch @entity26 sat wednesday morning in the front row of the small courtroom , where she has spent much of the past 16 weeks watching the trial			0
dr. @entity30 -- @entity7 's general practitioner in the @entity32 -- arranged for the @entity5 anesthesiologists to infuse the singer with propofol in a @entity37 hotel in july 1997 after sedatives failed to help him sleep between concerts , @entity11 testified			1
" i think they tried it and it had n't worked and if he could n't sleep , he could n't perform , " she testified			0
@entity7 " was at the end of his rope ; he did n't know what else to do			2
" he " felt better " after eight hours of propofol - induced sleep and decided to get a second treatment after his second @entity37 show , she said			0
@entity30 testified at the criminal trial of dr. @entity53 that he was never involved in giving propofol treatments for @entity7 and was not aware of the drug until much later			2
@entity11 , who met @entity7 when she worked as a nurse in the @entity58 office of dr. @entity59 , backed away from her previous statement at her deposition in which she said doctors also gave @entity7 propofol infusions in hotels in @entity65 during the @entity67 tour			1
@entity16 contends that @entity7 used propofol for years to treat his insomnia , including when @entity11 was traveling with him in @entity70 in the 1990s			1
the coroner ruled @entity7 died on june 25 , 2009 , from a propofol overdose administered by @entity53 , who is serving a prison sentence for involuntary manslaughter			2
@entity11 testified that @entity7 underwent surgery in 1993 to repair burns suffered years earlier			1
his doctors " could n't get a grip of the pain " and that two doctors " were having a pissing contest over who gave him the better drug			0
" " @entity7 had a very low pain tolerance , and his fear of pain was incredible , " @entity11 testified			1
" and i think that doctors took advantage of him that way			0
" @entity11 has rarely given interviews since her divorce from the pop icon , although she did testify in her former husband 's defense during his child molestation trial in 2005			2
@entity7 was acquitted on all charges in that case			0
@entity7 lawyers smiled as the trial recessed for the lunch break , indicating that they believed the defense witness was actually supporting their case			0
" @entity7 respected doctors immensely , that they went to school , that they studied and to do no harm , " @entity11 said			1
" unfortunately , some of the doctors decided that when @entity7 was in pain or something that they would try to outbid on who could give him the better drug and so he listened to those doctors			2
" @entity11 said many of the doctors who treated @entity7 were " idiots , " including the dermatologist she worked for from 1979 until she quit in 1996 before she married @entity7			1
" the only physician who ever cared for @entity7 as @entity121 was @entity30 , " @entity11 testified			2
" so @entity30 continued as his doctor ? " @entity16 lawyer @entity123 asked			0
" i do n't know , because @entity53 got in there and killed him , " @entity11 replied -- a reference to the doctor @entity16 is accused of hiring			2
@entity16 executives , who were promoting and producing @entity7 's comeback concerts , had no way of knowing that @entity53 was infusing him with propofol each night for two months in the spring of 2009 , @entity123 said			1
" almost no one knew until after his death , " he said			0
" @entity16 certainly did n't know about it			0
" the @entity18 's lawyers contend that the promoters ignored warning signs that @entity7 's health was deteriorating during the two months before his death			1
instead of getting him to another doctor who might have saved his life , they gave @entity53 the responsibility of getting @entity7 to rehearsals , they argue			0
@entity7 's mother and three of her children contend @entity16 is liable in his death because it negligently hired , retained or supervised @entity53			1
the company 's agreement to pay @entity53 $ 150,000 a month put the doctor in a conflict of interest because he was in deep debt and could not risk losing the job by refusing @entity7 's demands for propofol , their lawyers contend			1
@entity16 argues that while its executives negotiated with @entity53 to serve as @entity7 's physician for the " @entity162 " tour , it was @entity7 who chose and controlled the doctor			1
one revelation from @entity11 was that a @entity58 plastic surgeon faked doing a procedure on @entity7 on two occasions , although he told the singer he had done it			2
@entity7 complained about painful scars in his nose and went to dr. @entity173 to inject them with collagen , she said			0
" he put @entity121 out and did n't do anything but put tape on him as if he had treated him , " @entity11 testified			0
the doctor told her he did that because he could not find the scars @entity7 thought were there			0
wednesday is the 69th day of testimony in the trial , which the judge told jurors would likely be given to them for deliberations in late september			0
