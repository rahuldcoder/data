-- over the past few weeks almost a third of all @entity2 headed back to classrooms -- from early learning centers to universities , as students and as teachers -- accompanied by the usual seasonal mix of joys and jitters			1
lately it seems we 've been inundated with bad news : the nation 's report card is crummy ; schools are broke and failing ; graduates ca n't find jobs			1
and with competition for resources putting increased pressure on standardized test scores , cheating scandals have become practically ho - hum. among all these headlines resides a more quietly sobering fact : this year 's high school graduates will be the first educated entirely under the @entity27			1
in other words , a whole generation of kids who 've grown up with an emphasis on multiple choice testing , who 've been taught that knowing the one right answer is more important than the process of inquiry , who 've learned that admitting " i do n't know " is a crime			1
but the problem is n't simply with a narrowly conceived educational policy			1
pressure to know the right answer ( or , more precisely , to appear to know ) is n't limited to the classroom			1
it 's pervasive throughout our culture -- a reality at once daunting and hopeful			1
daunting because it means real reform will require more widespread change			2
hopeful because it means there 's something every one of us can do about it			1
i 'm talking about breaking the habit of faking knowledge in order to save face			2
for most of us , the fear of not knowing -- of looking dumb -- gets ingrained when we 're small and reinforced throughout life in ways both subtle and overt			1
for every time someone reassured us , " there 's no such thing as a stupid question , " were n't there ample experiences -- on the playground , at the dinner table , and yes , in the classroom -- that convinced us otherwise ? anyone who 's ever been reprimanded or ridiculed for revealing ignorance knows all too well : the taste of shame is bitter and lingering			1
we 'll go to great lengths to avoid it , often without deliberate thought			2
how many times have i found myself nodding in feigned recognition when someone makes reference to a person or book they assume i know ? how many times have i been guilty of unwittingly inflicting similar discomfort on others ? in some walks of life , presenting a knowing demeanor is practically a job requirement			2
one financial adviser recalls how , early in his career , he was so anxious to impress upon his clients that he knew was he was doing , he 'd use meetings to " information dump " -- only subsequently learning that they 'd been too embarrassed to speak up and confess they had no idea what he was talking about			1
a surgeon tells about the time when , as a new intern , afraid to admit unfamiliarity with a procedure and ask questions , she plunged in confidently -- and made an incision four times longer than the patient had been told the scar would be			1
politicians routinely face shame if they confess to not knowing			0
remember @entity119 's memory lapse during the 2011 @entity121 primary debate ? it seems we 'll forgive our elected officials just about any breach of ethics , but let them admit to anything less than invulnerable certainty and they can kiss our vote goodbye			1
for the past several years , i 've made a conscious effort to be candid about the limits of my own knowledge			0
as a college teacher , i 've discussed this intention explicitly with students and colleagues			0
guess what ? i 'm mortified to report : despite my public resolution to practice this most essential form of academic integrity , i still catch myself engaging in a kind of knee - jerk , face - saving , passive dissimulation on a semi-regular basis			0
based on what i hear from others , i 'm not alone			0
such behavior is apparently endemic			0
so what are we to do ? for starters , talk about it			0
own up to instances when we faked knowledge			0
initiate conversations about what makes us more or less susceptible to this behavior			0
you 're likely to hear some funny stories , and the experience of shared vulnerability is humanizing and makes for closer connections			0
best of all , it creates an environment in which all stand to grow			0
my friend @entity168 , during her years as a high school history teacher , constantly encouraged her students to play in the wide - open spaces of uncertainty			1
one way she did this was by sharing her own gaps in knowledge			0
she 'd model not just her comfort with not having figured everything out , but her delight in it			0
this , she seemed to convey , was where real intellectual pleasure lay : in the adventure of exploring the unknown			0
often she 'd assign @entity185 as a way of getting students to think about power and status			0
she 'd have them read one of the plays , then ask : " who 's more powerful in this scene ? " her students , anxious to deliver the " right " answer , would demand clarification			1
" what do you mean ? powerful how ? " @entity168 would shrug and unfurl her fingers : nothing up my sleeves			0
this is n't a trick			1
if her students protested , she 'd say simply , " that 's all i know			2
" and so they 'd be forced to grapple not only with the answer to her question , but with the meaning of her question , with the definition of power in the first place , which she , the authority figure , had just handed over to them : you guys figure it out			2
in this way , they were learning about history and drama but also about shifts in power , and who may wield it , and how classrooms can work and how societies can work , and about the very nature of " right " answers as opposed to the illimitable richness of interrogating the questions			2
this is what excites me when i think of heading back to school this fall : the prospect of bringing such generous , generative energy into the classroom			2
perhaps filling in the ovals with number two pencils is important for helping us understand how far we are from achieving equity in schools across the nation			0
that is a vital project , deserving urgent attention			0
but we wo n't ever achieve equity -- let alone excellence -- if we do n't also work to make our schools places where we all feel safe saying " i do n't know			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity262 .			1

this year 's high school grads will have been entirely taught under @entity27
@entity266 : there 's too much emphasis on memorizing the right answer rather than encouraging inquiry
she says *people* are *deathly* afraid of admitting that they do n't know something
@entity262 : our fear of ignorance keeps us from learning as much as we should
