i 'm a quitter and proud of it			1
november 20 -- the 37th anniversary of the @entity3 -- marks my 28th anniversary without a " cancer stick			1
" it was 1986 ; i was 28 at the time and had smoked a pack a day since i was 15			1
that 's about 95,000 cigarettes ! all these years later , writing that figure still makes me feel sick to my stomach			1
( or should i say , lungs ? ) the last cigarette : nine ex-smokers who quit the habit for good like a lot of teenagers in my day , i started smoking in high school			1
at the time , 1973 , it was the cool thing to do and if there was anything i aspired to , cool was it			2
sucked into the rip tide of popular culture , my juvenile - delinquent brain gravitated toward anything that questioned authority or was anti-establishmentarian , just like my heroes			2
too young to go to @entity31 , i could still bang out a @entity33 tune on my guitar , recite enough lines of @entity37 's " @entity36 " to prove i was cooler than cool and buy cigarettes			2
a cigarette dangling from these radical lips was part of the image i had carefully crafted for myself			2
cancer ? did n't give it a thought			2
and nobody at home mentioned it either			2
this , despite the fact that neither my mother nor my grandmother , with whom we lived , smoked			2
the war in @entity63 , the protests against it , the music , @entity57 , the psychedelic drug scene , feminism and the whole counter-culture movement was way more intriguing than president @entity65 's war on cancer			2
only old people got cancer			2
like my dear @entity69 , who died at 48 -- an astonishingly young age , i later realized -- of throat cancer , when i was in eighth grade			1
he started smoking at an even younger age than me			1
my high school in the suburbs of @entity76 had a smoking lounge my junior year , 1975			1
it was outside the cafeteria , so students could smoke before school and during lunch break			2
regardless , smoking did n't stop in the bathrooms , and i have plenty of suspensions on my record to prove it			1
still , i had a responsible side			2
i worked like a dog at a pizza joint in town and felt i had earned the right to spend my money the way i saw fit			0
@entity95 , i was bringing home $ 52 a week and spending less than $ 3 on my nicotine habit , with cigarettes costing 35 cents a pack			0
you know you 're hooked when , despite being bedridden with a terrible case of strep throat at 17 , you 're craving a cigarette			0
or when it 's 2 in the morning and you 're too tired to drive to 7 - 11 , so you scrounge through all your ashtrays , fishing for a butt with a modicum of tobacco left			0
or you 're with friends and they light up , so you light up because that 's just good social courtesy , right ? it was pathetic			0
i started coughing my junior year of college , especially in the morning			1
i was an @entity115 major spending all my free time writing poetry and song lyrics			0
those @entity120 got me through many all - nighters , typing papers on @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125			0
the drinking age at the time was 18 and the college bar scene was hopping			1
hell , we were just having fun , were young and invincible and had plenty of time to do " the adult thing " after graduation			0
it was 1982 and i had moved to @entity136			0
i netted about $ 100 a week working at a department store , as the demand for poetry and song writers was n't what i had hoped			0
depression and cigarettes made comfortable bedfellows			0
compared to a lot of things i could be spending my money on , cigarettes were tame and cheaper , i kept telling myself			0
but a major change was taking place			0
when i heard that secondhand smoke could harm the people around me , it was hard to swallow			0
more than two - thirds of nonsmokers and half of all smokers believed smoking was hazardous to the health of nonsmokers , according to a 1978 @entity161 report			1
i was hurting myself and innocent bystanders			0
sadly , it did n't matter enough			0
by 26 , i was waking up regularly in a cold sweat , my pulse racing so fast i thought i was having a heart attack			1
subsequent medical attention ruled out cardiac issues , but a chest x-ray revealed some significant " shadows " for a person my age			1
the doctor clicked his tongue annoyed , " you should give up smoking			1
it 's just not cool			0
" for two years , i lived with the horrible burden of panic attacks , not knowing what caused them or how to stop them			0
then one day , in a brilliant moment of clarity , i realized that i was scared to die			0
i was scared to die from the effects of smoking cigarettes			1
it was all so clear -- i had to quit smoking			1
i had read about the @entity3 in the local newspaper			1
it was the following thursday , november 20 , 1986			1
it was the nicest present i could give her -- she did n't think smoking was very ladylike -- and the present i had to give myself			1
i quit cold turkey and never looked back			1
sometimes that first year i would wake up with nightmares that i had started smoking again			1
i had to shake myself until i realized that i had n't and embrace , once again , my victory over dependence			0
twenty eight years later , i 've lived a second life with a wonderful marriage , two beautiful daughters , and many incredible adventures			0
i 've never once craved another cigarette or had a panic attack			0
at 56 , i 'm still finding out just how cool life really is			0
