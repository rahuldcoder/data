-- less than a month ago , gun control seemed destined for its day in @entity2			1
in the wake of the shooting of 20 schoolchildren and seven adults in @entity7 , @entity8 , a major revision to the nation 's gun laws appeared , to many observers , inevitable -- a sure thing , even			1
" this awful massacre has changed where we go from here , " longtime gun rights supporter sen. @entity19 , @entity21 , tweeted three days after the shooting			2
" i think , " said sen. @entity22 , @entity24 - @entity23 , " we could be at a tipping point			0
" indeed , with bullet - riddled bodies of 6 - and 7 - year - olds being carried from a first - grade classroom , opposition to tighter gun laws could hardly seem to withstand the deluge of media attention and outrage from a horrified public			1
yet congressional opposition has not wilted			1
and this week , as the grim one - month anniversary of @entity7 approaches , vice president @entity36 signaled that the @entity39 might be prepared to enact reforms through executive order rather than risk a fight for comprehensive legislation on @entity44			2
to look at the polls , opposition in @entity2 seems puzzling			0
although support for an assault weapons ban is not high , clear majorities of @entity48 support a variety of other measures proposed by gun control advocates			1
in a recent @entity55 / @entity54 , 92 % said they favored a law that would require background checks at gun shows			0
more than six in 10 @entity48 support a ban on high - capacity ammunition clips			0
even many gun owners embrace reforms			0
the political influence of the @entity64 , which strongly opposes any new gun laws , helps explain why some members of @entity2 do n't support measures that large majorities of @entity48 want			2
but the dynamics of media and public attention are also crucial to understand what 's happening			2
the gun control debate illustrates what is known as the " issue - attention cycle			1
" this occurs when a dramatic event -- in this case , the @entity7 shooting -- causes the media and public to become intensely interested in a policy issue for a brief time , before moving on to other problems			1
following high - profile mass killings in the @entity48 , there often is a surge in news coverage about gun control			1
but within a few weeks , coverage reverts to where it was before the shooting			0
this was evident following the 2007 massacre at @entity95 , the 2011 shooting of rep. @entity97 and last year 's attack at an @entity100 , @entity101 , movie theater			0
@entity7 , for all its unique dreadfulness , has so far been little different			2
in the week beginning a day after the tragedy -- from december 15 through december 21 -- 2,472 stories in the nation 's newspapers mentioned gun control			1
these data come from a search of more than 500 news outlets indexed in the @entity113 " database			0
in the next week , the number of gun control stories fell by more than half , to 1,192			1
the week after -- from december 29 through january 4 -- it was down to 962			0
meanwhile , journalists found a new object of attention			0
from december 29 through january 4 , the @entity113 database included 3,636 stories mentioning the fiscal cliff -- nearly four times as many as mentioned gun control in that same week			1
the economy did n't tumble over the cliff , but gun control did			2
these patterns have consequences for public opinion , which tends to take its cues from the media			2
without sustained attention to gun control , @entity48 are not likely to view the issue as particularly salient			1
even in a @entity54 fielded in the days after the @entity135 , just 4 % of @entity48 said guns were the country 's most important problem			0
most mentioned the economy , which has dominated the news for months			0
as a result , there is less pressure on gun control opponents , most of whom are @entity147 , in @entity2 to strike a deal with those seeking stronger gun controls , most of whom are @entity153			1
opposing gun reforms that might be popular with @entity48 , but not important to them , may be less risky for many politicians than running afoul of a powerful interest group such as the @entity64			0
this does n't necessarily mean that gun legislation is moribund			0
perhaps the efforts of the anti-gun violence organization founded by @entity97 -- a decidedly compelling advocate for gun control -- may sustain the media 's attention			1
that could make the issue more important to voters , which might create a greater incentive for @entity2 to act			0
but with the coming political fight over the debt ceiling , media attention to guns may remain in relatively short supply , especially as @entity135 recedes in the rearview mirror			2
the reality of the issue attention cycle suggests that gun control advocates ' best hope may lie in executive action , not the legislative process			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			0

@entity186 : after @entity7 shooting , it seemed time was ripe for new gun control laws
but congressional opposition has not wilted , @entity184 says
he says after mass killings , media attention surges , public follows ; both *quickly* drop
@entity184 : pattern same with @entity202 , and gun control opponents count on it
