@entity0 has no wine - making tradition but the country now uncorks more bottles of red than any other			1
it 's home to a growing middle - class thirsty for new tastes , international vintners trying to win their share of the market and @entity12 winemakers working to find their own identity			1
here , four wine experts , who appear on the latest episode of @entity17 's on @entity0 show that airs this week , examine some of the myths that have grown up about wine drinking in @entity0			1
myth ? @entity12 do n't know much about wine @entity23 , co-founder of @entity25 - based @entity24 , says that when she first started educating people about wine , her students were focused on a narrow selection of premium red wines			1
" they talked about @entity32 of course and some talked about @entity34 , " she tells @entity17 's @entity0			1
" now i have students arrive in class and they say , ' well i 've heard about prosecco and i love drinking it			2
' or ' i really like @entity41 sauvignon blanc , it 's a very exciting drink , i love it in the summer			0
' " " the sustainable ' i love wine ' section of the market is still small but we have an appreciable number , " she says			2
myth ? @entity0 does n't have the right conditions to produce good wine @entity52 , chief executive of @entity53 in @entity55 province that produces 400,000 bottles of wine a year , says @entity0 is not an easy place to grow grapes , with summer rains and winter frosts			1
and in most grape - growing areas , vines have to be buried under the soil during winter			1
" this restricts our growing season -- we usually bury the vine in november and unearth in early april -- and not to mention the cost incurred as a result , " she says			0
what 's more , she adds , given that @entity0 does n't have a long wine - making tradition , it 's hard to know which grape variety is best suited to each region			1
but despite these challenges , @entity78 is confident of her product			0
" after 17 years of experiment , i think we can make very decent wine			0
" myth ? people do n't drink the wine they buy historically , many @entity12 did n't actually drink the wine they bought , says @entity88 , founder of wine distributor @entity89			0
instead , bottles of premium @entity32 costing hundreds if not thousands of dollars were intended to impress as lavish gifts but this custom has come under scrutiny as part of a government anti-corruption campaign			0
" there was a lot of gift giving six , seven , 10 years ago , " he says			0
" today , that market is not as important as it used to be			0
" more often , he says " it 's about friends , it 's about getting together with a group of people to share the experience of wine			2
" although he adds that it 's still rare to find people who drink a glass of wine by themselves or a husband and wife sharing a bottle at home			2
myth ? @entity12 like to mix their wine with cola there 's an often - shared notion that the @entity12 wine drinker buys a bottle of @entity32 and mixes it with @entity124			1
is this fact or urban legend ? twenty years ago , it might have happened , says wine consultant @entity128 , but it 's a thing of the past and @entity12 palates are increasingly sophisticated			1
" to be honest , if you look at most of the wine they were probably drinking 20 years ago , i 'd mix it with coke , " she says			2
myth ? @entity0 will never produce a truly top tier world class wine @entity141 , wine writer for the @entity142 , says when she first visited @entity0 in 2002 the wine industry was in an " embryonic state " and local enthusiasts came up with just two names when she asked for recommendations			1
" now it would be closer to 200 , i expect			0
" but she says she 's never tasted a @entity12 wine that she would term " extraordinary			2
" " i have opened @entity12 wine at home just to share with friends who are curious , " she says			0
" but i have n't yet found a @entity12 wine that would be worth , on its own merits , serving at my dinner table , i 'm afraid			0
but i 'm sure it will happen			0
