food and music are two things that are very close to this grammy - award - winner 's heart			1
" i grew up singing as soon as i could talk			0
i grew up in the kitchen as soon as i could stand			0
" @entity13 told @entity0 while sitting in his tour bus strumming his guitar before a recent show at @entity18 's @entity17			1
it was his love of music and food that got @entity13 thinking about a better experience for some fans at his shows			1
he thought the traditional " meet - and - greets " were impersonal and did not allow for a performer to really know fans			1
so , he teamed up with his friend and chef , @entity30 , to create the " @entity31			1
" @entity13 also throws a giant music and food festival " what we love about the @entity31 is that it completely turns the table around on the fans " @entity13 said " we 're eating with them and serving them , hanging out with them			1
that is the best fellowship we can create			0
" so where does chef @entity30 get enough food to feed 150 selected fans in a strange town with only a few hours to prepare ? " my forte is to make a huge meal for a lot of people off the top of my head " @entity30 explained as he headed in to the open air @entity48 in @entity18			1
" it is nerve - racking and it 's very challenging , but why make it easy ? this is my life , this is what we do			2
" for nearly five hours the chef bobbed and weaved through the various tents sampling fresh ingredients and looking for inspiration for this night 's feast			2
" got some black garlic ... it 's fermented garlic " ... " it 's a rat - tail radish ... it 's got a really spicy kind of radish bite to it			2
" finally some inspiration rolled over @entity30 and he dialed up one of his assistants back at the kitchen outside @entity17			1
" how are you , buddy ? " he asked the voice on the other end of the phone " we 're gon na do a mixed beet salad today so i 'm gon na need one of those large pots of water going			2
" in his phone @entity30 carries the menus from every @entity31 since 2009			1
he mixes and matches to come up with something new every night ) @entity30 's stage is 54 - foot semi that has been converted in to a state - of - the art kitchen with all of the bells and whistles			1
her name is " cookie "			0
throughout the afternoon , @entity30 directs a staff of cooks as they start making the meal that will feed 150 people before the concert			1
it is a show in and of itself			0
" @entity30 's personality is way too big to be stuck back in a kitchen some place			1
" @entity13 said when describing his friend before they went out to talk to the gathered crowd who would enjoy this meal			2
for over an hour band members stand behind tables spooning large helpings of @entity30 's food on to fans plates and @entity1 stands at the end of the line talking to each and every person as the pass by			1
they are not curt conversations			0
people linger and talk food and music			0
@entity13 says he thinks that takes away from really listening to everyone			1
" i love that connection that is made and hopefully it 's something they remember			0
a lot of times i 'm playing and i walk out to the edge of the stage and people are looking at me through their phones so they 're filming instead of being in the moment			2
" it 's kind of like going back to analog interaction , which i love			0
" and for fans lucky enough to break bread with the @entity1 a picture is the last thing they needed to take away			2
@entity148 who attended the @entity149 had a rave review			0
" they had a rat - tail radish			2
i 've never seen one , i 've never consumed one			0
it was awesome ! " when the lights dimmed and the band walked through the ivy covered walls of the 100 - year - old @entity17 it was time put down the plates and pick up instruments and play			0
after nearly three hours the band was playing the last song of the night and , once again , singing about fried chicken , pecan pie and cold beer .			0
