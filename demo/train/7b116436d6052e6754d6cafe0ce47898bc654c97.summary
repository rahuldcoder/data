-- the village of @entity2 in @entity5 's @entity4 prefecture was once home to 6,000 people			1
today , however , it is essentially a ghost town , evacuated after the accident at the @entity12 nuclear power plant just 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) away following the @entity14 earthquake in march 2011			1
while former residents can return to @entity2 during the day , it 's still an eerie scene -- children 's toys lie abandoned in yards , bicycles rust on front porches and only an occasional truck passes through its quiet streets			1
for elderly couple @entity24 and @entity25 the last 20 months have not been easy			2
@entity24 lived had lived in his home in the village for more than 60 years , moving in just after @entity28			1
" i ca n't describe it			2
it 's hard living in the temporary housing , and it 's very stressful mentally , " he says			2
the difficult situation has also taken its toll on his wife @entity34			2
we 're getting old , " she says			2
" i think every day how long i can survive in this situation			1
" only one building -- the town 's nursing home -- has permanent residents			1
following consultation with their families and the @entity5 government , the 80 or so people living there were allowed to stay despite the evacuation order			2
@entity48 , a former @entity2 resident who left after the nuclear accident , returns to work there each week for a very simple reason			0
" these people will stay here for the rest of their life , " she says			0
" and i cherish them just like a family member			0
but i do n't know if our village will be able to come back anytime soon			1
" however some are trying to make the village inhabitable for all : crews who have the hazardous task of trying to clean up from one of the worst nuclear accidents the world has ever seen			1
they perform repetitive tasks -- wiping down buildings with damp cloths , and using high pressure hoses to clean drainage systems along the streets			1
workers are also clearing a layer of top soil in @entity2 , as well as the numerous other affected areas of @entity4 prefecture			0
but it 's an endless task , as it 's a region that 's roughly the size of greater @entity83			0
so far , it 's not clear what the government intends to do with the countless bags of contaminated dirt			0
some critics , including experts on radiation , call the government 's clean - up efforts " meaningless " and say that using high pressure hoses simply spreads the radiation			1
others contend that wiping down a building with a wet rag is pointless , particularly when the wind blows from the nearby forest which is still contaminated			0
@entity2 's mayor , @entity101 , has heard those arguments but insists they have to start somewhere			0
" we have a responsibility to clean up and decontaminate this land			1
i ca n't accept the idea that we give up			0
and it 's hard for some people to just start a new life elsewhere , " he says			0
@entity113 remains hopeful that he and his wife can return to their home one day			1
" but we do n't know when that will happen			0
it 's hard to predict our future , " he says .			0
