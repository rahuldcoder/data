-- what really motivates us ? and what motivational techniques lead us to work smarter and live better ? those are questions that behavioral scientists around the world have been exploring for the past half - century			1
their answers might surprise you			2
in laboratory experiments and field studies , a band of psychologists , sociologists and economists have found that many carrot - and - stick motivators -- the elements around which we build most of our businesses and many of our schools -- can be effective , but that they work in only a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances			1
for enduring motivation , the science shows , a different approach is more effective			1
this approach draws not on our biological drive or our reward - and - punishment drive , but on what we might think of as our third drive : our innate need to direct our own lives , to learn and create new things , and to do better by ourselves and our world			1
in particular , high performance -- especially for the complex , conceptual tasks we 're increasingly doing on thejob -- depends far more on intrinsic motivators than on extrinsic ones			1
read more about @entity40 's talk at @entity41 with these conclusions in mind , here are a few ways to tap your third drive and enlist the science of motivation at work , with your children and in your personal life			1
work : try a @entity53 the @entity55 software company @entity54 has an ingenious method for stoking innovation			1
once a quarter , on a thursday afternoon , they allow their developers to work on anything they want , any way they want and with whomever they want			1
the only requirement is that people have to show what they 've created to the rest of the company at a fun and spirited meeting 24 hours later			1
@entity54 calls these sessions " @entity72 " because people have to deliver something overnight			1
these one - day bursts of autonomy have produced an array of fixes for existing software and ideas for new products that might not have emerged otherwise			1
this is n't management through carrots and sticks			2
it 's innovation through autonomy			2
you can give this a whirl at your organization			0
set aside an entire day when employees can work on anything they choose , however they want , with whomever they 'd like			2
make sure they have the tools and resources they need			0
and impose just one rule : people must deliver something -- a new idea , a prototype of a product , a better internal process -- the following day			1
the results might amaze you			0
@entity106 : give your children an allowance and some chores -- but do n't combine them in the peculiar world of human motivation , sometimes adding two positives can give you a negative			2
take the case of chores and allowances			0
chores show kids that families are built on mutual obligations and that all members need to help each other			0
allowances teach kids to be responsible for , and manage , their own money			2
but combining the two is a big mistake			0
by linking money to the completion of chores , parents turn an allowance into what i call an " if - then " reward ( as in " if you do this , then you get that			1
" ) the science is very clear that " if - then " rewards , while effective in some circumstances , can trigger an avalanche of unintended consequences			1
in this case , the carrot of payment sends kids a clear ( and clearly wrongheaded ) message : in the absence of cash , no self - respecting child would willingly set the table , empty the garbage or make her own bed			1
it converts a moral andfamilial obligation into just another commercial transaction -- and teaches that the only reason to do a less - than - desirable task for your family is for payment			2
so keep allowance and chores separate , and you just might get that trash can emptied			0
even better , your kids will begin to learn the difference between principles and payoffs			0
@entity174 : find your sentence @entity176 , one of the first women to serve in @entity178 , once said , " a great man is a sentence			0
" what she meant was that anybody who ever achieved anything of enduring significance was n't running in 17 directions at once			0
those who leave left a lasting imprint -- not just on their country , but also on their families and communities -- are animated by a singular purpose			0
one of the best ways to find your purpose is to ask yourself a variation of @entity176 's question : what 's my sentence ? when all is said and done , how to do you wanted to be remembered ? how will the world be different because of your presence on it ? your sentence need not be @entity206 in its scope			2
( " he led a revolution from tyranny and helped guide a young democracy			0
" ) maybe it 's " she served every patient who came into her office whether or not that person could pay			0
" maybe it 's " he taught two generations of children how to read			0
" maybe it 's " she raised four children who are now happy and healthy adults			0
" there are few better navigational tools than to find your @entity225 of purpose			0
so ask yourself : what 's my sentence ? you might find the answer motivating			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity40 .			1

our *traditional* idea of motivation is to reward good behavior with money , @entity40 says
he says *research* shows that carrot - and - stick motivators work only in limited circumstances
he says many people motivated by need to be creative , productive , *independent*
he says managers and parents can adopt better ways to motivate
