@entity14 police chief @entity13 previously has said authorities were confident that someone took @entity8 from the house			1

" " we believed from the beginning that @entity8 did n't walk out ( of the house ) on her own , " @entity8 said			1
" why it took 14 days for police to say this , i do n't understand			1

" i have to believe that @entity8 is with somebody , and i just want that person to find the courage to do the right thing and find a way to return her safely , " the father said in his statement wednesday			1
