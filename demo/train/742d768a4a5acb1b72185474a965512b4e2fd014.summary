-- move over @entity1 -- a @entity3 animator has produced an educational cartoon to teach youngsters about @entity7 culture			1
tired of @entity7 children watching only imported cartoons that did n't reflect their lives , @entity3 animator @entity8 decided to do something about it			1
his creation is " @entity15 and @entity16 , " a cartoon aimed at three to five year olds , about a brother and sister who live with their grandparents in an unnamed @entity7 city			1
" i want to create a brand that 's as good as @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , quality wise , made in @entity3 , that is educational , and also shows positive aspects of @entity3 / @entity7 culture , not just to @entity3 or @entity7 kids but to kids everywhere , " says @entity8			1
the pilot episode celebrated @entity3 's @entity33 and looked at the issue of colonialism			0
the cartoon has also had segments teaching the numbers one to 10 in the @entity40 and @entity41 languages			0
he adds that he wants the program to " teach kids and show that the stuff you see on tv of starving people is n't the only thing ( in @entity50 ) -- you have a middle class here who have the same aspirations as everybody else			1
" see also : meet the @entity57 @entity15 and @entity16 is n't the only children 's cartoon produced in @entity50			1
" @entity60 , " for example , is made in @entity62 for the @entity63 , while " @entity64 " is produced in @entity50 and has been shown internationally			0
but both cartoons , like many set in @entity50 , tell stories about the continent 's exotic animals			0
@entity8 was determined to do something different			0
" i said i 'm not going do @entity7 folk tales , animals -- that 's what you get in ( animated movie ) ' @entity78 ' -- we do n't want to do that , " he says			0
" we want to show a couple of kids in a middle class life , which i know is n't the reality of all the kids in @entity50 , but let 's show that reality -- the reality of people using laptops , phones , going to school , doing their daily business -- no talking ants , no dancing ' jinga jinga ' music -- just a cartoon of life			1
" two full - length " @entity15 and @entity16 " episodes have been shown on a channel on @entity101 in the @entity102 , where @entity8 says it has been well received			1
the next step is to attract the funding and sponsors needed to get the cartoon aired in @entity3			2
it takes @entity8 and his core team of four a month and a half to produce a single episode of @entity15 and @entity16 , which is just eight minutes of animation			2
his says the slow turnaround is off - putting for sponsors in @entity3 , where feature - length @entity115 movies are often produced in a matter of weeks			0
see also : @entity3 blockbusters for internet generation @entity8 adds that when it comes to entertainment , some @entity3 have a mindset of " @entity123 is best , " but he is determined to change people 's minds by showing it 's possible to make a credible homegrown alternative to imported programs			2
he believes that it 's not enough for @entity7 to complain of being underrepresented in foreign cartoons , or misrepresented by international media -- they must also do something about it			2
" people complain that @entity50 is not represented well in the media , " says @entity8			0
" i understand that , but my point is @entity3 and other parts of @entity50 are n't poor , you have businessmen , the infrastructure , the ability to link up and make studios , finance it and sponsor it and make the market -- stop waiting for @entity1 to do it , do it yourself			0
