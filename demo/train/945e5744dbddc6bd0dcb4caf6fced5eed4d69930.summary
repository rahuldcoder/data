these days , @entity0 is hot and @entity2 is not			1
there 's a tech bubble and no one knows when exactly it will pop. we have sky - rocketing valuations like @entity9 ( $ 13 billion ) , @entity10 ( $ 41 billion ) , @entity11 ( $ 10 billion ) , @entity12 ( $ 10 billion ) and so on			1
college students think tech is sexy and just about everyone seems to want to be called an entrepreneur			2
but there 's one problem : the startup world is cluttered with " wantrapreneurs " who fail to recognize that success demands a tenacity , resiliency and energy unlike any traditional job short of combat infantry soldier or @entity28 team member			1
many enthusiastic founders who finish startup training and acceleration programs disappear quickly and quietly from the scene as customers yawn about their big bold ideas			1
these entrepreneurs aspire to be the next @entity38 , and upon learning such a goal is as ephemeral as winning the lottery , their zeal wanes quickly			1
one top venture capitalist remarked that we see only about a dozen great companies emerge every year in the @entity44 often , they 're doing boring and un-techy things like preventing or curing diseases , or solving complex big data challenges that just are n't as sexy or well - publicized as the next hot - or - not dating app. as the job market recovers , hopefully , more of those wannabes turn to good old - fashioned @entity52 jobs , with predictability , stability and health insurance			2
it 's a place where 99 % of people belong			1
the lesser entrepreneurs should go out and find regular jobs , clearing the clutter for those with the idea , drive and overwhelming ambition to build truly great companies			1
because really , we do n't need more startups that are lame , same and tame			2
lameness : ready to work 90 + hours a week ? if you 're not a passionate , tenacious , driven entrepreneur willing to work 90 - plus hours a week while confronting a high failure rate , update your resume and get a job			2
if you 're dedicated and your startup is guilty of sameness , lameness or tameness , blow it up ! do something dramatic to differentiate your company and offer lasting value			1
recognize that virtually every good startup idea is " out of the building " -- between the ears of your customers who are the only people whose opinions matter			1
embrace those people , talk to them , and build something really amazing that will be craved by the millions , not thousands , for years , not months			2
sameness : do we really need a gazillion game apps ? how many digital games does a single planet need ? the 1.3 million apps available in july 2014 on @entity95 included over 200,000 game apps and more than 8,000 apps just to help create or save your favorite recipes			2
how can anyone get excited about the next food , personal finance , web marketing or taxi dispatching tool with three or four cute new features ? scores of niche versions of @entity109 , for example , have died painful deaths , trying to do just what @entity109 does well , but for some subset of the business world			1
too many startups offer little more than a tweak in an effort to distinguish themselves			0
@entity118 : is it just air behind massive valuations ? massive valuations were once the reward for unstoppable meteoric growth			0
just think back on the very early days of @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			0
sadly , very few startups sustain that kind of growth for anywhere near as long as they sustain their sky - high valuations			0
how quickly did @entity135 come and go ? where went the rapid user growth of @entity138 and @entity139 and @entity140 , among many others ? when @entity139 merchants and customers did n't return , the stock went from a peak of $ 30 to a recent close of under $ 8			0
@entity147 recognizes that it ca n't forever be a leading retailer			0
its remedy ? new delivery systems , @entity147 web services , content , publishing platforms and more			0
@entity147 will do what it takes to not be labeled tame			0
@entity125 has seen a leveling off of its enormous search ad revenues , but the many businesses it has invested in or acquired will likely drive its growth for years to come			0
what about @entity10 -- the new kid on the block ? why would one of the world 's most highly valued startups offer winter price cuts in 48 cities ? its low - end @entity167 is just as tame if not sadly unimaginative			1
" cheaper than a @entity173 taxicab ! " is hardly the mantra of a great company			0
but if you must ... according to the @entity178 , @entity176 's leading entrepreneurship advocate , in 2013 about 476,000 new businesses started per month , including everything from hair salons to tech startups backed by @entity182 and @entity183			1
while new businesses help create jobs in the economy , the failure rate is high			0
survival rate , as government data points out , drops dramatically after a few years			0
so for all the entrepreneurs out there : here 's a piece of advice , whether you 're starting a pizza parlor or the next @entity147 , truly great companies that endure are built on inventive solutions to significant problems confronted by at least millions of people			1
and those people -- not your investors , coaches , advisers or professors -- are the ones who hold the keys to unlocking a great business they want to spend time or money on			0
far too few startups invest the sweat and blood to identify those opportunities and deliver a one - two punch of disruptive innovation and relentless execution .			0

the startup world is cluttered with " *wanrapreneurs* , " or wannabe entrepreneurs
many aspire to be the next @entity38 , but that 's like trying to win the lottery
