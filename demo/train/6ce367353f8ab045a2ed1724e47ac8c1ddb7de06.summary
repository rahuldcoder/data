but planners say @entity7 's subsidies are too much for a nation that is facing a consolidated fiscal deficit of 8.4 percent			1
as world leaders pledged fiscal tight - belting at the @entity100 summit in @entity101 , @entity7 said it has its plans in place to halve its deficit in three to four years			1
ahead of the meeting , @entity7 removed subsidies that artificially kept cost of petrol lower than its market value -- as a result , the prices of gasoline and cooking fuel , like kerosene and kitchen gas , shot up			1

" our subsidy system is badly flawed			0
" nonetheless , @entity123 's government , now in the second year of its second term in office , remains firm			0
