another common household object is getting " smart " and hopping online			1
this time it 's your smoke detector			1
nest is releasing a new smoke and carbon monoxide detector called @entity6 that will send a message to your mobile device when the alarm is triggered or when the battery is low , so you can be alerted to an emergency at home even while you are away			1
in addition to the usual loud beeping alarm sound , the @entity6 has added a recording of a human voice that will describe the problem			1
this is the first entirely new product tche @entity20 company has introduced since its flagship nest thermostat			0
nest was started by ex-apple designer @entity23 in 2010			0
@entity23 said he was looking for a better way to make his tahoe home more energy efficient			0
the @entity6 learns your patterns over time and automatically controls a home 's heating and cooling systems for maximum efficiency			1
old thermostats were wasteful , but what did @entity6 think was wrong with the traditional smoke and carbon monoxide detectors ? @entity38 seemed to be first on the list			1
when the battery is low in a smoke alarm , the small white discs emit a low beep until the battery is replaced			2
annoyance can be a safety issue			0
when a sensitive alarm is set off by everyday occurrences like burnt waffles , some people remove the batteries from their alarm to shut it up and are left unprotected			0
@entity6 eases you into an emergency instead of immediately blaring every time kitchen experiment goes awry			1
when it first detects smoke or carbon monoxide , the device will turn yellow and the human voice will say where the smoke or carbon monoxide levels are high			1
since most alarms are affixed to the ceiling , getting to them to turn off an alarm requires a tall person or a chair			0
nest has added a sensor that lets you wave at the device to reset it or to get more information about an alarm			2
one of the selling points of smart objects is that they can talk to each other			0
the @entity6 can connect with the @entity6 so that when carbon monoxide is detected , the thermostat can power down the gas furnace to be safe			1
it also connects with other @entity6 devices and can communicate which location is detecting a problem			2
this is not the first connected smoke alarm			0
some existing " smart home " systems already include support for traditional fire and carbon monoxide alarms			1
you can connect a smoke alarm to a system like @entity94 or @entity96 's @entity95 and set it up so that you get a text , phone call or e-mail notification on a phone or tablet when an alarm goes off			0
those alarms are just connected versions of traditional devices and do not have features like human voices or wave controls			2
connected home devices are a growing market , and most systems are focused on creating vast networks of inexpensive connected objects , like front door locks , motion sensors , power switches and thermostats			0
@entity6 's approach is different			2
it is investing money and time into completely redesigning the objects themselves instead of just creating a system for connecting inexpensive objects to a larger network			0
the result might be a better experience , but the cost for each device is much higher			0
the @entity6 is $ 129 , a @entity131 smoke and carbon monoxide detector that can connect to @entity96 's @entity134 system costs $ 40 .			1

@entity6 is a new " smart " smoke and carbon monoxide detector
it sends alerts to phones , turns off with a wave and includes a human voice recording
the $ 129 device will be available in *november* online and in @entity147 *stores*
