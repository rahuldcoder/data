@entity2 's clockwork car a working model of @entity2 's car on display in 2004 at the @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity2 is renowned for his forward - thinking sketches and intricate designs , which included blueprints for a bicycle , a submarine , and a helicopter			1
but you ca n't win ' em all			0
@entity2 also designed a three - wheeled wagon - like device -- often referred to as the clockwork car -- that never really lived up to the hype			1
its spring - operated design makes it the first - known concept for a self - propelled vehicle			1
and because it was designed without a driver 's seat ( though a secondary steering column was present ) and was meant to be programmed along a specific course , the clockwork car is also thought to be one of the world 's first robots			1
some speculate that faulty interpretations of @entity2 's notes prevented the success of his ideas , but there 's plenty of evidence to the contrary			1
when engineers finally constructed a working model of the car in the late 1990s , it only traveled 40 feet			2
the monowheel in 1869 , @entity44 craftsman @entity43 of @entity45 built the first in history 's line of unsuccessful monocycles			2
sitting inside the monowheel , a rider steered the contraption by shifting his or her weight in the desired direction			0
as if that was n't difficult enough , the massive outer wheel remained directly in the rider 's line of sight at all times			2
braking was also potentially hazardous , as stopping too abruptly would cause the rider to be propelled forward along with the outer wheel			2
but perhaps the biggest strike against the monowheel was the immediate comparison of any rider to a gerbil -- something even the @entity44 would n't tolerate			0
the @entity69 it 's a car ! it 's a bed ! it looks suspiciously like a child 's toy ! for the outdoorsman who has everything except a really expensive @entity78 , there was the @entity69			1
a single - passenger off - road vehicle , the @entity69 not only allowed drivers to travel to remote areas , it also gave them a place to bed down for the evening			1
with its collapsible seat , steering wheel , and roll bar , the boxy monstrosity from 1990 offered all the comforts of a really cheap motel room			0
and while we ca n't be sure why the car never made it past the concept stage at @entity69 , we can only guess members of the off - road focus groups felt silly driving a @entity97			1
the @entity98 a quasi hot potato of international engineering , the @entity98 was initially funded by the @entity102 government , designed by a @entity104 engineer , and eventually assumed by the @entity105 as part of the @entity108 weapons race			0
the @entity110 - like contraption was 18 feet in diameter , but only 3 feet thick			0
it featured vertical takeoff and landing and was designed to reach speeds up to 300 mph while remaining elusive to radar			0
unfortunately , the two - person craft was never able to stabilize at heights above 8 feet , nor travel faster than 35 mph			0
after eight years and more than $ 10 million , the project was abandoned in 1960			0
the @entity120 @entity121 was many things -- inventor , philosopher , @entity126 nominee , and bearer of a name that makes @entity130 's kids feel average			1
among his many architectural and engineering creations , @entity121 tried his hand at automobiles			0
in 1933 , using a v - 8 engine loaned to him by @entity135 , @entity121 built the @entity120 car			1
truly a wonder to behold , the @entity120 was nearly 20 feet long , got 30 - plus miles to the gallon , held up to 12 people , had a maximum speed of 120 mph , and could do a u-turn in 20 feet , thanks to a single rear wheel that controlled the steering			0
unfortunately , the car 's steering appears to be at fault for a fatal accident at the 1933 @entity149 , when the @entity120 was rubbernecked by another car			2
although later evidence placed fault on the driver of the other car , negative publicity surrounding the wreck caused investors to pull away from the project , and @entity121 was freed up to build geodesic domes and work on his friendship with @entity162			0
the fortunate outcome of the @entity120 's failure ? @entity166 's hit tune , " what one man can do , " which was written for @entity121			0
the @entity169 originally designed in 2001 to push the limits of electric automotive technology , the @entity169 ( @entity171 - emission ) vehicle is part science - fiction , part sports car , part limousine , and entirely unattractive			1
but the beauty of the @entity169 lies in its eight wheels , each powered by its own battery , which allow the luxury concept car to reach speeds in excess of 190 mph without emitting any pollution			1
the car 's design also makes for a safe ride because what would normally be the engine compartment is a crushable zone , reducing risk to the driver			2
sadly , the @entity169 came off as less luxury automobile and more cartoon , sending the designers back to their drawing boards			2
