@entity0 -- federal aviation officials are telling airline and airport executives that they are working to minimize any disruption from imminent government budget cuts to passenger airline service , but warn the mandatory belt - tightening will impact air traffic overall			1
at a meeting in @entity0 on tuesday , the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) said it would give priority to 77 " core " facilities -- large airports and their related air traffic control centers , which it did not identify			1
but the agency would reduce staffing system wide and would likely close 238 control towers at less busy airports			1
those towers handle 5.8 percent of all commercial air traffic , the @entity10 said			1
opinion : cuts too deep ? no , not deep enough " it was clear at the meeting that the brunt of the cuts were at the cost of general aviation ( private and business aircraft ) , and the agency even recognized that , " said @entity25 of the @entity26 , a group representing private pilots in @entity0			2
the @entity38 faces about $ 1 billion in budget cuts through the end of the fiscal year unless @entity42 acts by friday to avert them			0
the cuts are part of a political impasse affecting spending across the government			2
much of the agency 's austerity will hit the @entity10 , which employs about 15,000 controllers and oversees traffic at more than 400 airports used by commercial airlines , business jets and private pilots			1
large airports will also be impacted			0
all @entity10 employees have been told they may be furloughed at least one day every two weeks , inevitably meaning that aviation facilities will have fewer controllers			1
while the cuts would inevitably reduce the number of operations -- take - offs and landings -- the @entity10 said it would maintain the highest level of safety			1
the impact would be greatest at the nation 's small - and mid-sized airfields , the @entity10 acknowledged			1
the 238 control towers facing possible closure met a criteria established by the @entity10 : they have fewer than 150,000 operations a year and fewer than 10,000 commercial airline operations			1
opinion : cuts will turn off voters @entity79 is courting of those towers , 189 are " contact towers , " operated under @entity10 supervision by independent contractors			1
the remaining 49 are staffed by @entity10 controllers			2
@entity10 officials said it would consider removing a tower on a case - by - case basis if advocates could justify a change			0
but any towers spared from closure would have to be off - set by cuts elsewhere , they said			0
most of the changes would occur at the start of april , and would ratchet up over a period of months			0
the first furloughs would begin april 8 , according to a meeting participant			0
if a tower is closed , operations at those airports would continue			0
but controller operations would be shifted to other facilities , or to the pilots themselves , who would radio their intentions to take off , land , and maneuver on the ground			0
ground operations could present the biggest danger to pilots , since it would remove from service controllers who are trained to look for conflicting movements on the runways and taxiways			0
critics say the @entity10 failed to consider important factors when compiling its list of towers , including whether the towers were also used for military operations and for search and rescue missions			2
@entity10 officials also said tuesday it would suspend development of its @entity128 navigation system so it could reassign employees to control towers			1
and it would suspend its redesign of airspace -- an ongoing program to make the area around airports more efficient			0
the @entity10 also said budget cuts would force it to cut back on maintenance and repairs at " non-core " facilities			2
only power , voice and navigational systems would be fixed at those facilities , the @entity10 told the industry executives			1
@entity25 said while the @entity10 disclosed a few new details about its plans to deal with forced spending cuts -- known in @entity0 as sequestration -- it was " certainly not as much detail as we were looking for going into the meeting			1
" participants in the meeting questioned whether the @entity10 is making the smartest cuts			2
'' clearly they have to make the cuts , " @entity25 said			0
" what 's unclear is how they came up with them			0
there has n't been any transparency in the process			0
" more spin than solutions as spending cuts near			0
