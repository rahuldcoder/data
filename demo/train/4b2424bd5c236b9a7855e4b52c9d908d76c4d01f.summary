@entity3 is safe once more from the threat of " apartheid " -- the word , that is			2
@entity8 secretary of state @entity7 has clarified comments made in a closed - door meeting last week , and he stated clearly that @entity3 is not an apartheid state			1
but @entity7 's dire warning , and the future the secretary was predicting for @entity3 , lingers			1
that point seems lost amid this week 's onslaught against @entity7 , as members of @entity19 and @entity3 advocates raced to prove their @entity21 credentials with their outrage			1
the histrionics over the secretary 's remarks are yet one more sign of how fundamentally broken @entity8 politics are when it comes to @entity3			0
vast energy is poured into defending @entity3 from an inappropriate word			0
yet nowhere near enough energy is devoted to promoting policies that will actually protect and save @entity3 's @entity34 democracy in the long run			1
labels aside , @entity3 is maintaining the longest military occupation in the world			0
in the territory occupied in 1967 , @entity34 residents enjoy all of the benefits of @entity3 democracy , while @entity44 residents in the same territory lack basic rights of citizenship			1
many predict the number of non-jews in the land between the @entity52 and the @entity53 soon will be greater than the number of @entity34 , and everyone from president @entity56 to @entity3 prime minister @entity57 has come to understand what this means			2
without a two - state solution to this conflict , @entity3 draws ever closer to an unfathomable choice : forsake its democracy by establishing rule of a @entity34 minority over a @entity67 majority , or forsake its @entity34 character by granting equal rights to all residents under its control			1
that 's the future that former @entity3 prime ministers @entity74 and @entity76 warned about when they invoked the specter of apartheid , and it 's that future that @entity7 has been working tirelessly to avert with his @entity3 - @entity44 peace initiative			1
it 's a choice that draws sadly closer , now that @entity7 's efforts have passed their initial nine - month deadline , and the parties have resumed the familiar cycle of provocation and retaliation			2
to question @entity7 's commitment to @entity3 over a word , after everything that he 's done to help @entity3 , is absurd			1
no @entity8 leader has done more to help @entity3 gain acceptance in the international community and ensure its long - term peace and security			0
what friends of @entity3 should really be asking themselves is not whether they are doing everything they can to protect @entity3 from being called certain names , but whether they are doing everything possible to secure its future as the democratic home of the @entity34 people by bringing about a two - state peace			1
sadly , this question is conspicuously absent from our politics			0
many politicians ' reflexive defense posture at times like this allows our friends and family in @entity3 to continue believing that the root of their problems is anti-israel bias rather than the expansionist policies a right - wing minority is foisting on their country			2
they need to hear that the policies of that minority are out of sync with the values and the interests of the @entity8 , and that staying the present course risks the foundations of the relationship between the two countries			0
shooting the messenger does @entity3 no favors			0
friends of @entity3 should start by thanking @entity7 for his commitment to @entity3 and supporting him as he seeks to break the present impasse in negotiations			0
and if we can channel as much passion and energy into ending the conflict as we do into protecting @entity3 from painful words , @entity3 may yet stand a chance .			0

@entity139 : @entity7 used the word apartheid about @entity3 , setting off a *firestorm*
he says we need that passion devoted to policies to protect @entity3 's @entity34 democracy
@entity139 : non-jews will *outnumber* @entity34 , which will hurt @entity3 without two - state solution
he says the word apartheid has been used by @entity3 politicians : @entity7 is a friend to @entity3
