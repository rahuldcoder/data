eight days after the invasion of @entity4 on march 19 2003 , @entity0 , then deputy defence secretary and a leading proponent of the war , told a congressional committee : " we are dealing with a country that can really finance its own reconstruction , and relatively soon			1
" a decade later , that assessment could hardly have turned out to be more wrong			0
the @entity10 has overwhelmingly borne the brunt of both the military and reconstruction costs , spending at least $ 138bn on private security , logistics and reconstruction contractors , who have supplied everything from diplomatic security to power plants and toilet paper			1
an analysis by the @entity23 reveals the extent to which both @entity10 and foreign companies have profited from the conflict -- with the top 10 contractors securing business worth at least $ 72bn between them			1
none has benefited more than @entity30 , once known as @entity30			1
the controversial former subsidiary of @entity32 , which was once run by @entity33 , vice-president to @entity34 , was awarded at least $ 39.5bn in federal contracts related to the @entity4 war over the past decade			1
two @entity38 companies -- @entity39 and the state - owned @entity40 -- are the second and third - biggest winners , securing contracts worth $ 7.2bn and $ 6.3bn respectively			1
the @entity10 hired more private companies in @entity4 than in any previous war , and at times there were more contractors than military personnel on the ground			1
" these numbers are staggering , " said @entity48 , the @entity49 senator who has led the charge to tighten contracting controls			0
" in the last decade , we 've seen billions in taxpayer money spent on services and projects that did little -- sometimes nothing -- to further our military mission , " she said			1
but companies on the top 10 list defended their record			2
@entity30 " performed with honour and sacrifice in a hostile , complex , ambiguous and unpredictable environment " , said @entity63 , a company spokeswoman			1
she noted that @entity30 had prepared and served more than 1bn meals and produced more than 25bn gallons of drinkable water and 265 tons of ice			1
@entity70 , a spokesman for the @entity71 , a @entity72 - based company that secured contracts worth $ 2.1bn to transport fuel from @entity75 to @entity10 forces in @entity4 , said : " we are proud to have effectively supplied jet and convoy fuel in a war zone to the @entity10 military			1
" the business environment for these contractors may be changing , with the war in @entity4 over and the conflict in @entity86 winding down , but these private companies remain			1
there are still 14,000 contractors , including 5,500 security guards , in @entity4 even though the last troops left in december 2011			2
" contractors are here to stay as real players , " says @entity92 , the special inspector general of @entity4 reconstruction			2
" the opportunities in this field are shaped by the unpredictable rhythm of when a fragile state will fail			0
" the ft 's list of the top earners over the past decade is based on all federal government contracts awarded for performance in @entity4 and neighbouring @entity38 since the invasion was planned			1
compiling such a list is tricky because some contractors operate under a variety of names to avoid scrutiny			0
that makes these figures conservative			0
the list includes companies working in supplying support services , security , reconstruction and the oil industry			1
" this is not my grandfather 's military industrial complex , " said @entity118 , vice-president of the @entity119 , a national security think - tank partly funded by defence contractors			2
" there 's not a single munitions producer in this list			0
" instead , the @entity10 had created a fifth branch of the military , he said			1
" it 's called the private sector			0
" the extensive use of contractors in both @entity4 and in @entity86 has been steeped in controversy			0
a 2011 report from the commission on @entity136 in @entity4 and @entity86 estimated that defence contractors had wasted or lost to fraud as much as $ 60bn -- or $ 12m a day -- since 2001			1
private contractors have been involved in some of the most shocking events of the @entity4 conflict -- from the @entity143 shootings in 2007 in which @entity145 security guards killed 17 @entity4 , to the @entity146			2
while the era of easy money may have ended for these contractors , that does not mean the boom times are over			0
in 2011 , the state department estimated that it would pay $ 3bn over the next five years on its private security contracts to protect its massive embassy complex in @entity155 alone			2
meanwhile , contractors are winning new business as oil companies ramp up their operations , especially around areas such as @entity161 in the south			2
" it 's not like these companies have shut up shop and are going home , " says @entity163 of the @entity164			2
" we are still sinking a lot of money into this and we are still trying to get our oil dividend			0
" that means that companies that branch out into other areas could have an even better decade ahead			2
given the controversies that have surrounded the use of contractors in @entity4 , many analysts say that there is little evidence that the defence department has learnt about how to best use them			0
" while @entity187 is much better at using contractors than they were 10 years ago , they are still not sufficiently prepared to use contractors in future large - scale military operations , " says @entity185 , an analyst at the @entity186			0
after a six - year wrangle , the @entity191 in december passed the @entity193 , a sweeping overhaul of wartime contracting aimed at improving oversight and cracking down on waste and fraud			0
it was pioneered by ms @entity48 , who says she has " spent years shining a light on the massive waste , fraud and abuse in military contracting "			0
mr @entity92 and the @entity205 have also made specific recommendations for improvements			0
but a @entity209 report last year found that the @entity187 had taken or planned actions based on only half the @entity205 recommendations , while the state department and @entity213 had acted on only one - third of the recommendations relating to them			0
" the reality is that the @entity10 is not well structured to carry out stabilisation and reconstruction operations on an integrated , inter-agency basis , " said mr @entity92 , the special inspector - general			1
" that is the most serious and continuing problem			0
we must ensure we do not repeat the errors and weaknesses seen in @entity4			0

@entity10 spent at least $ 138 billion on security , logistics and reconstruction since the war
the controversial former subsidiary of @entity32 , @entity30 , earned the most
two @entity38 companies -- @entity39 and @entity40 -- also big earners
