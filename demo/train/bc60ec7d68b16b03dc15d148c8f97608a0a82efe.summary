-- ten @entity3 @entity2 organizations threatened this week to cease working with the @entity4 , citing " mccarthy - era tactics " by the agency , including efforts to covertly infiltrate @entity9 mosques			1
@entity10 , then of the @entity4 's @entity12 office , speaks at the @entity13 in 2006			2
the groups claim the @entity4 has sent undercover agents posing as worshippers into mosques , pressured @entity2 to become informants , labeled civil rights advocates as criminals and spread misinformation			1
the @entity4 declined to comment on specific allegations but called the proposed move unproductive			2
" limiting honest dialogue , especially when complex issues are on the table , is generally not an effective advocacy strategy , " spokesman @entity24 said in a statement			1
" the @entity4 has continued our outreach efforts , across the board , with a number of concerned groups and where we agree -- or disagree -- most have concluded the best results are achieved through continued conversation			1
we believe that , too			0
" the group 's statement , dated tuesday , said several incidents of the @entity4 " targeting @entity40 lead us to consider suspending ongoing outreach efforts			1
" the statement was issued by the @entity44 on @entity45 , whose director , @entity46 , could n't immediately comment because of a family emergency			0
the @entity4 has sent " agents provocateur " into @entity9 mosques , according to the statement , which says an @entity4 agent threatened to make one mosque member 's life a " living hell " if he did not become an informant			1
though the statement does not name the mosque member , the @entity57 said last month it would seek an investigation into the february 21 arrest of @entity62 , an @entity63 native			1
" mr. @entity62 previously reported to [ @entity57 's @entity12 office ] and other community members that , during a raid of a friend 's house , an @entity4 agent urged mr. @entity62 to work with the agency , saying that if he refused to cooperate his life would be made a ' living hell , ' " a news release said			2
@entity62 , a member of the @entity13 , told @entity57 his arrest was retaliation for his refusal , the release said			0
the @entity4 directed questions about @entity62 's arrest to the @entity3 attorney 's office in @entity12 , @entity9 , which declined comment			1
@entity62 , 34 , was indicted last month on charges of perjury , procuring naturalization unlawfully , using a passport procured by fraud and making false statements			0
a search warrant for @entity62 's @entity90 , @entity9 , home said @entity62 became a naturalized citizen in 2004 and made false statements about his past aliases and international travel			0
he also made false statements about contact with his brother - in - law @entity99 , the indictment said			0
@entity101 is said to be @entity103 's security coordinator and has been labeled a " specially designated global terrorist " by the @entity3 government , the indictment said			0
an @entity4 agent said in open court that @entity62 also had discussed terrorist plots with an undercover informant , according to media reports			1
@entity62 has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him			0
@entity57 's problems with the @entity4 began before @entity62 's arrest			1
last year , the @entity4 discontinued its " formal contact " with @entity57			2
the tuesday statement said the @entity4 unjustly designated @entity57 and other organizations as " unindicted co-conspirators " in the @entity119 case			2
a jury convicted @entity119 leaders last year of conspiring to support terrorism and launder money for a terrorist group			2
" making this unjust designation public violates the @entity128 's own guidelines and wrongly implies that those listed are somehow involved in criminal activity , " the statement said			0
the @entity4 's @entity24 declined to comment on specifics , but said the @entity4 wants to avoid " formally constructed partnerships " with @entity57			2
" our concerns relate to a number of distinct narrow issues specific to @entity57 and its national leadership , " @entity24 said			0
before the @entity4 severed formal ties , @entity57 officials had met with the @entity4 to discuss hate crimes targeting @entity2			1
on occasion , @entity57 offered assistance in investigations			0
the group also held training sessions for @entity4 agents on @entity13 culture and ways to improve interactions with the @entity2 community			1
@entity57 this week called the @entity4 allegations a " campaign of smears and misinformation , " a remnant of the @entity157 administration			0
" it is not surprising that we would be targeted in a purely political move by those in the previous administration who sought to prevent us from defending the civil rights of @entity40 , " said a statement from the group 's national communications director , @entity159			0
tuesday 's group statement also mentioned " a flourishing of anti-muslim activity " during the previous administration and expressed fear that " counterintelligence programs are quelling lawful dissent			1
" unless the @entity4 affords fair treatment to all mosques , @entity2 and @entity2 groups , the statement said , @entity2 should consider suspending ties to the agency			1
" this possible suspension , of course , would in no way affect our unshakable duty to report crimes or threats of violence to our nation , " it said .			0
