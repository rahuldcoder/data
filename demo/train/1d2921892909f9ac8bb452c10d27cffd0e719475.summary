-- @entity1 was an unknown quantity when he arrived for a junior weightlifting tournament in @entity4 nine years ago			1
chaotic and intensely religious , the @entity6 region is known by locals as " the most dangerous place in the world			1
" the 12 - year - old @entity1 , with his short , jet - black hair and smooth , unblemished skin , looked younger than the other boys			2
but , despite it being his first ever tournament , he was still stronger than everyone else			2
for his father @entity19 , a local college lecturer , the decision to register his son for the tournament paid off handsomely			1
@entity1 was crowned the junior boys ' weightlifting champion , the first step on a journey that would take him into the world of professional sport			1
except @entity26 was n't really his name			2
@entity1 was actually called @entity28			1
" i suggested the name of @entity1 for her since she had always been like a boy , " explained @entity30 in an interview with @entity32			2
" she liked the name very much			2
" girls and boys this is n't a story of deception , but rather a tale of necessity			2
@entity28 is @entity6 's number one squash player , ranked 49th in the world			1
she also comes from an ultra conservative region in @entity6 that is home to the @entity48			1
female participation in any form of public life is strongly discouraged , by both words and deeds			0
education , working , sports ; anything involving women leaving the house unaccompanied by a male relative was seen as the work of the devil			0
teen athlete fled @entity48 stronghold to pursue dream but @entity28 had talent			1
her weightlifting triumph gave her access to a world of sporting options that would otherwise have been out of bounds to her as a female , and she discovered the discipline where she would make her name			1
squash is one of @entity6 's most popular games and @entity28 excelled at it			1
by the age of 21 she had gone pro and broken into the world top 50 , an incredible rise up the world rankings			1
she is one of only three @entity6 women in the top 200 ; by contrast the nation has 15 men in the same strata			1
yet her success has come at a price			0
@entity28 and her father have been threatened with retribution by the local @entity48 for insulting their culture and their religion			1
" my area , my tribal regions are called the hub of terrorism and extremism , " said @entity28			1
" it 's the home to the @entity48 , and it 's called the most dangerous place in the world			1
but i have a big vision for my country , and for my people it will be stopped			0
i always thought that maybe i 'm the chosen one			0
" standing up @entity28 realized at a young age that she was different to other people she saw in her community			1
" when i was four and a half , i told my parents that i want clothes like my brother , " she said			0
" i want to play with boys , there 's more freedom , i felt			2
and i am not like girls who play with dolls			0
i want the toy guns and things like that			0
" such behavior was anathema to the deeply conservative community she was born into			0
rather than forcing his daughter to conform , he thought about how best to realize his daughter 's talent			2
it was he who came up with the plan to cut his daughter 's hair and enter into competitions with the boys			2
" they ( religious elders ) sent me to a mental asylum ' cause they thought that i had deviated from the culture , and that i was crazy supporting women 's rights , " he recalled			1
" they said i was spoiling the whole environment and that all women would want the same rights			0
" with the boys ' junior weightlifting title under her belt , @entity28 decided to enter a boys ' squash tournament			1
her disguise was scuppered by bureaucracy			0
" my dad said , ' this ... that 's my son , ' " @entity28 recalled of the moment her father presented her to be registered			1
but the official dropped a bombshell			0
" he said , ' ok , we need the birth certificate , too			0
' " threat @entity158 decided to come clean , and entered her in the girls ' competitions			0
she destroyed the opposition and , at the age of 15 , was national champion			2
it was then that the trouble started			0
" i found a letter on the windshield of my car			0
it was signed by the name of ' @entity48 , ' " her father said			1
" they told me -- they threatened me -- ' stop your girl from playing squash because it is bringing a bad name to our culture and to @entity182			1
' they told me , ' if you do not do this then you will have to suffer very bad consequences			0
' " i ignored that threat ... ( but ) we were very much concerned that she might get shot or she might get kidnapped			0
" the warning terrified @entity190			0
scared for the safety of her family , she decided not play in public			0
" i told my dad that i might need a gun			0
i do n't know what to do , " she said			0
" he said , ' it 's your decision			2
i never stopped you from anything			0
you wan na play or not ? ' " squash is everything for me			2
and i know that when a girl is kidnapped , it 's the biggest dishonor			2
i 'm not gon na bring dishonor for them , ever			0
" so @entity28 played in the house , lonely and miserable			1
from dusk until dawn she hit the ball against the wall with her " @entity213 " racket			1
her father knew that if he wanted his daughter to realize her potential , she had to leave @entity6			1
" he said , ' okay , if you wan na play , just leave the country			0
that 's all you can do			2
' " the power of persistence @entity28 agreed			1
for three long years she would write to everyone			0
clubs , players , educational institutions			0
but then , when she was 18 years old , she received her only reply			0
it was the same name that graced her first racket : that of former world champion @entity213			1
" i could n't believe that there was a woman squash player from @entity4 , let alone , one that could actually play , " said power of the day he received @entity28 's email			1
@entity213 retired at the top of his game , as number one in the world			1
instead he set up a national academy in his home town of @entity245 , looking to find talent in people from places squash rarely reaches			2
@entity28 's letter melted him			1
it read : dear sir , i 'm @entity253			0
i belong to @entity4 of @entity6 's tribal areas on the @entity256 border			1
@entity4 one of @entity6 's most turbulent tribal agencies and the home to @entity48 is also my home			1
here girls of my age are passing their lives in such miserable conditions			0
they are restricted to four walls despite having the desire to come out of the @entity266 and get assimilated with the rest of the world			2
i will be waiting for your positive response			0
regard , @entity253 , professional squash player			1
@entity213 was moved to reply , and soon @entity28 was on a flight to @entity272			1
" it 's unbelievable , " he said			2
" she left on just hope , on a one - way ticket and 200 bucks on an email promise from me			0
" world champion the aim for @entity190 is to be world champion			1
she works from morning to night with @entity281 , moving up the rankings as she gets close to realizing her dream			2
being away from her family is tough			0
she talks to them every day on the internet			0
she scours the news sites looking for information on suicide bombings and killings , praying they are nowhere near her home			0
so far , they have n't been			0
" the timeline is ' till she 's world champion and she goes home with a trophy , " @entity213 asserted confidently			1
" there is no substitute			0
" yet in a region where some revile a woman 's sporting success , a world championship has extra problems			1
more publicity , greater exposure , increased danger			2
that does n't matter to @entity310			0
@entity311 could open up opportunities for others like her , playing squash or lifting weights or kicking a soccer ball in their bedrooms as they wait for the world outside to change			1
" someone wants to kill me ? kill me once i bring the change and i become a world champion , " she said			1
