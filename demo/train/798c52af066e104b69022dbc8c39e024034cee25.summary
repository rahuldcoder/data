@entity0 may have made the headlines for @entity3 's record breaking exploits over the course of the last week , but the @entity8 club 's arch rivals responded by making their own little piece of history saturday			2
@entity11 notched up a club record 16th consecutive victory in all competitions -- a run that stretches all the way back to the middle of september -- by overcoming a gallant @entity18 2 - 1 away from home despite having midfield - star @entity20 sent off late on			1
@entity21 stretched to tuck home @entity23 's cut - back after 18 minutes to put the reigning @entity26 champions on their way			1
@entity28 sealed the points late in the second half by racing clear of the @entity18 defense and lofting the ball beyond @entity33			1
@entity20 was then sent for an early bath after earning a second booking for tripping up @entity36 before @entity37 grabbed an injury - time consolation for @entity18 with a looping header			2
the result stretches @entity11 's lead atop of the @entity43 table to five points , although @entity0 , @entity45 and @entity46 will be looking to reduce that deficit when they play tomorrow			0
all the focus after the game , however , was on the new club record			1
" we have achieved a record that demonstrates the work we have been doing , " said midfielder @entity51 in comments carried by the @entity11 website			0
" but the goal we set ourselves is to win every game with humility , work and struggle			0
" @entity11 will now look to extend the record when they face @entity62 in the @entity63 on tuesday			0
in the day 's early @entity43 fixtures , @entity64 ran out 2 - 1 winners away to mid-table @entity67 while @entity68 had too much for @entity69 , running out 2 - 1 winners			1
@entity71 @entity73 's seemingly unstoppable march to a third straight @entity71 title continued apace saturday with a 1 - 0 victory away to @entity76			1
@entity78 's first half goal was enough to stretch @entity80 's men lead atop the table to 10 points , although that could be reduced back to seven if second place @entity83 overcome @entity85 on sunday			0
elsewhere , @entity86 moved up to third with a 5 - 1 hammering of @entity88 while unfancied @entity89 rose to fourth by overcoming struggling giants @entity90 3 - 1			2
fifth placed @entity92 made up for their humiliating midweek loss to @entity94 by defeating @entity95 4 - 1 in @entity96			2
in what was perhaps the game of the day in @entity100 , though , @entity97 edged out @entity101 4 - 3 in a seven - goal thriller			0
@entity103 @entity104 struck early on at the @entity105 to give @entity106 a narrow 1 - 0 win over mid-table @entity108			1
the @entity110 striker lashed home from the penalty spot after 15 minutes and despite coming under pressure in the second half the @entity113 held on for the win			0
the hard - earned result means reigning @entity119 champions have closed the gap on league leaders @entity122 to a single point			0
elsewhere in @entity119 saturday , @entity125 's stuttering start to the season continued with a 2 - 0 loss away to fourth placed @entity128			2
goals from @entity130 and @entity131 were enough to ensure @entity133 's side could n't follow up their impressive @entity135 victory over @entity86 earlier in the week			0
further down the table @entity136 defeated @entity138 2 - 0 while @entity139 and @entity140 drew 1 - 1 .			1

@entity11 set new club record of 16 consecutive victories
goals from @entity21 and @entity28 secure 2 - 1 win over @entity18
@entity73 and @entity106 both win in busy day of @entity26 *football*
