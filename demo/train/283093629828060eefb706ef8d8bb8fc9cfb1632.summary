@entity1 , @entity0 -- " @entity4 social media			1
" in the famously restrictive country , where people have almost no @entity9 contact with the outside world , it sounds like an oxymoron			0
but on february 25 , @entity12 of the @entity13 became perhaps the first person to send a mobile tweet from @entity4 when she posted a message on the country 's new @entity18 wireless network , available only to foreigners			1
" hello world from comms center in â € ª # @entity23 € ¬ , " she wrote			0
@entity24 has been active from @entity4 on @entity25 as well , posting snapshots of street scenes , food and government propaganda posters			1
as the @entity13 's bureau chief for both @entity32 and @entity4 , @entity24 is the only @entity34 news reporter granted regular access to the secretive nation , which she has visited more than 20 times			1
she offered a rare glimpse of digital life beyond the @entity40 -- the strip of land separating @entity4 from its more open rival to the south -- during an onstage chat here saturday at the @entity47 festival			1
at a time when @entity4 is responding to tougher sanctions from the @entity50 with angry rhetoric and threats , @entity24 described a country with two parallel digital worlds -- one for residents and another for foreign visitors			1
while foreigners now have access to fast broadband internet , with no firewall blocking certain sites , @entity4 can only use a state - controlled intranet service			1
the country lags behind much of the world when it comes to digital adoption , but there are signs that @entity4 is trying to catch up , @entity24 said			1
the new @entity70 3g network -- jointly owned by the @entity4 government and an @entity73 company -- that launched last month marks a shift in policy for @entity78 's regime , which also has recently begun to allow foreigners to bring their cellphones into the country			1
" we are starting to see more openness , " she said			0
" we 're talking baby steps			0
they 're a long way from being a free and open society			0
" when @entity24 first visited @entity91 in 2008 , security officers confiscated her @entity92 at the airport , she said			2
" i freaked out , " she said			0
" i tried to hide it in my pocket			0
" @entity24 is joined in her social media updates from @entity91 by @entity13 photographer @entity97 , who posts images often to his 71,000 @entity25 followers			1
his photos offer a fascinating peek at @entity4 life and culture : teens skating on a roller track , a woman braving a snowstorm , photos of his in - flight meal on @entity111 , @entity4 's airline			2
@entity24 said that @entity4 , a country of about 25 million people , has only about 1 million cellphones , although the devices are gaining in popularity			1
@entity4 ca n't access @entity117 or @entity118 , although they have primitive social networks -- sort of like online bulletin boards -- where users share thoughts about innocuous topics such as pop music , she said			2
everything @entity4 do online is tied to their identity , @entity24 said , so it 's easy for the government to monitor users ' intranet behavior			2
@entity24 said she has spent a little time on the country 's limited web but has n't seen any evidence of people using underground networks to talk more freely			2
" i would like to ( see that )			0
but it would be very dangerous , i imagine , " she said			0
" they have a culture of fear in @entity4 that still exists			2
that 's something that is n't going to change right away			0
" when former @entity145 star @entity144 made a bizarre visit to @entity91 last month , @entity24 said she encouraged the unlikely ambassador to take advantage of the nation 's new 3g cellular network			1
he took her advice , later tweeting , " i come in peace			0
i love the people of @entity4 ! " @entity24 said the @entity4 government has never tried to censor what she reports			2
but she is mindful that authorities may be monitoring her web use			0
" in any situation where i 'm accessing their broadband , they can probably see everything i 'm doing , " she said .			0
