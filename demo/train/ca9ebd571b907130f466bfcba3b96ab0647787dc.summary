-- neighbors said the house on @entity3 in @entity6 's @entity5 neighborhood had been vacant for years			1
three years ago the now - defunct predatory lending bank @entity7 refused to renegotiate the ballooning interest rate on a mortgage filled with hidden clauses and traps			0
instead , @entity7 sold the mortgage to @entity12 , which , in turn , initiated foreclosure proceedings			0
in the @entity5 neighborhood , one of the poorest parts of the @entity17 , more than 16 per 1,000 homes are in foreclosure , the highest rate in @entity21 and one of the highest nationwide			2
banks are foreclosing on homes at rates far faster than they can sell them			1
in a report released this week , the @entity27 , the independent research arm of @entity28 , found an increasing percentage of homes are going unused due to high rates of foreclosure and unemployment : " @entity37 vacant properties have increased 51 % nationally from nearly 7 million in 2000 to 10 million in april 2010 , with 10 states seeing increases of 70 % or more , " the report said			1
in our down housing market , most foreclosed homes sit vacant for years and , neglected by the banks , fall into disrepair and further blight neighborhoods			1
you can literally walk down any block in @entity5 and see every sixth house or so boarded up			0
one study in @entity49 estimated that , between 2008 and 2012 , all homeowners will lose $ 78.8 billion in home values due to foreclosure rates and blighted homes in their neighborhoods			2
meanwhile , @entity55 has spent much of the last decade without a home , in and out of @entity21 's shelter system			0
@entity58 has an 8 - year - old daughter with severe autism and a 5 - year - old son			0
struggling to find work while struggling to care for her kids , @entity55 thought her luck might change earlier this year when she received a voucher from the @entity21 government that would allow her to move out of the shelter system			2
but then , she says , that vital helping hand was abruptly pulled away , the voucher cut by mayor @entity71 's recent austerity measures			0
this brings us to the newest front in the @entity76 movement : matching needy homes to needy families			1
this week , @entity76 organizers moved @entity58 and her family into the vacant @entity3 home now owned by @entity12			1
pulling the strings of @entity87 and using our tax dollars , big banks orchestrated a massive bailout for themselves but continue to offer no relief to homeowners suffering under the bad loans they made and the bad economy they created			1
in the last several years , homelessness in @entity21 has jumped 45 %			2
meanwhile , in 2009 when the unemployment rate in the city was 10.1 % , unemployment topped 19.2 % in @entity5			0
those who argue that @entity99 should be coddled while people in places like @entity5 have to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps have an unrealistic grasp of the depths of @entity17 's inequality			2
how can people like @entity55 pull herself up by her own bootstraps when she ca n't even afford boots ? so the @entity109 may be finding its next phase in helping struggling @entity17 across the @entity17 keep their homes out of foreclosure or occupy vacant homes that have been foreclosed			1
eviction defenses and occupations are planned in more than 20 cities			0
and the idea is catching on beyond organized protests			0
in @entity121 this week , police and movers refused to evict a 103 - year - old woman from her home when the bank foreclosed on it			2
of course , if you think foreclosing on a 103 - year - old woman ( and her 83 - year - old daughter ) is heartless , ask yourself at what age is it ever acceptable to kick struggling families out of their homes in a bad economy , only to leave the houses vacant and decaying ? you can say that 's just how banks work , like it or not			1
but that 's the same excuse for why corrupt lenders like @entity7 initiated loans with terms so bad that its managers found themselves under criminal investigation			0
it 's the same excuse for the banks causing the housing crisis and crashing our economy by making bad bets on subprime loans , and then begging the government to cover their losses			2
this is an anti-free market manipulation of our economy to benefit the 1 % while hurting the rest of us			0
the @entity17 economy , as @entity99 has rigged it , violates the principle of capitalism proffered by @entity160 and the ideal of equal opportunity enshrined by our founders			0
to " rescue " our economy , we let big banks write down their bad debt			2
so , to rescue homeowners , banks must write down underwater mortgages , helping homeowners adjust the principle of their loans to reasonable , pre-bubble levels , keep families in their homes and stabilize the housing market			1
millions of @entity17 have lost their homes			0
in 2010 alone , banks filed a record 3.8 million foreclosures			0
totals for 2011 are expected to be even higher			0
many people are living on the couches of relatives or spending their savings on low - end motel rooms or are homeless			0
a 2010 study by the @entity185 in 26 cities found the rate of homelessness had jumped a startling 9 %			0
but the occupy movement is bringing some hope and opportunity back to our nation , restoring the idea that our economy and our political system can and must work for the 99 %			1
granted , helping homeowners stop eviction orders and helping homeless families occupy empty , bank - owned homes is a short - term strategy , but one that will hopefully draw public attention to the injustice of millions of foreclosed homes and millions of homeless families , an injustice that banks could easily have addressed if they cared about our nation and our economy a fraction as much as they care about their bottom lines			1
anyone who argues the occupy movement is n't " clear about its demands " should talk with @entity55			1
@entity87 's hands are tied by @entity99 and wo n't budge to create jobs , force the banks to adjust mortgages and cutour monstrous inequality			1
so it 's up to we , the people , taking empty homes from banks that have already taken too much from all of us and giving them to hardworking and needy families			1
in doing so , the occupy movement is not only creating opportunity for more and more @entity17 but also creating a home for the 99 % in a political and economic system that has far too often kicked us all to the curb			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			2

@entity235 : vacant building in @entity6 represents new front for @entity76
she says organizers match foreclosed homes with needy families to *redress* inequality
she says banks bailed out by *taxpayers* *coldly* foreclose , homes empty , homelessness up
@entity235 : since @entity87 wo n't force banks to find *solution* , occupy movement will step into breach
