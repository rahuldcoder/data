@entity1 , @entity0 -- for nearly 30 years , one man dominated @entity0			1
@entity4 , 82 , survived would - be assassins and ill health , crushed a rising @entity8 radical movement , and maintained the peace with neighboring @entity10 that got his predecessor killed			1
his government 's continued observance of the @entity15 accords was the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the decades - long @entity20 - @entity10 conflict			1
but following the revolt that toppled @entity23 's longtime strongman , demonstrators in the streets of @entity1 stood up to riot police , chanting , " @entity4 , @entity27 is waiting for you			1
" ultimately , the demonstrations helped bring down the man critics called @entity0 's last pharaoh			1
@entity4 decided friday to step down , vice president @entity33 said on state television			2
now that @entity4 is finally exiting the political stage , the debate over his legacy is growing louder			2
longtime observers of the region say the stability @entity4 purchased for nearly three decades came at the cost of entrenched poverty and repression in the @entity20 world 's most populous nation			1
" @entity0 is a broken country , " @entity47 , a professor of @entity49 relations at the @entity50 , told @entity2			1
" it used to be the jewel of the @entity49			2
it 's the capital of its cultural production			0
" but now , @entity47 said , " @entity0 have no outlets			2
they do n't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future			0
" @entity4 was a @entity60 - trained pilot who was chief of staff of @entity0 's air force during the 1973 @entity49 war			1
the early success of @entity0 pilots against @entity10 made him a national hero , and then - president @entity67 made him vice president in 1975			1
six years later , @entity67 died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade , killed by @entity73 militants from within the army 's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with @entity10			1
upon assuming office , one of @entity4 's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that barred unauthorized assembly , restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely			1
he made extensive use of those powers in the ensuing decades			0
the @entity0 army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986 , and he threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists			2
" he pretty much wiped them out , " @entity97 professor of history @entity98 said			0
" it 's not an accident that they were in @entity103 instead of @entity0			2
" the government penetrated opposition movements so thoroughly that " if five people ( sat ) down to plot something , the fifth person ( wrote ) a report to @entity4 about it , " he said			2
the result was " a regime that has very little legitimacy , but presents itself as something there 's no point in trying to change , " said @entity117 , a professor of @entity49 politics at @entity119 in @entity120			1
but @entity117 said the january 14 overthrow of @entity23 president @entity123 @entity122 , who fled to @entity27 after 23 years in power , changed the thinking of many in the region			0
" i think what the events in @entity23 did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it , " he said			0
@entity4 headed off a similar movement in 2005 , when @entity0 mounted large - scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform			1
he intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated @entity137 , harassed middle - class demonstrators and managed to pick off the leadership of those protests , @entity117 said			0
but the most recent protest movement had " no real leadership , so it ( could n't ) be decapitated the same way , " @entity117 noted			0
@entity4 won four terms as president in elections that were considered formalities			0
his fifth , in 2005 , was @entity0 's first multi-party presidential vote , but it was widely criticized as a " sham , " @entity98 said			2
meanwhile , the country 's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of @entity4 's rule			1
development picked up in the last decade , fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars , but gains were " very unevenly distributed , " @entity47 said			0
about 40 % of @entity0 currently live in poverty , he noted			0
the aging autocrat escaped at least two assassination attempts , including a close call in 1995 when @entity73 militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-african conference in @entity167			0
in recent years , @entity4 had several bouts of illness but never picked a vice president			2
he was widely believed to have anointed his son @entity171 as his successor , but later insisted he never intended for his son to take power			0
in 2003 , @entity4 collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the @entity0 parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu			1
he had back surgery in @entity180 in 2004 , returning in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed			0
he largely withdrew from public view in recent years			0
his domestic political situation was closely watched overseas , particularly in the @entity184			0
in the past decade , @entity0 has been a major player in @entity10 - @entity187 peace talks , and it contributed troops to the @entity184 - led coalition that drove @entity190 out of @entity191 in 1991			1
it receives about $ 1.3 billion in military aid from @entity120 every year -- second only to @entity10 -- and has received nearly $ 30 billion in economic aid since 1975 , according to @entity196 figures			1
but it opposed the @entity184 invasion of @entity190 in 2003 , and while sticking with @entity15 , @entity0 's ties with @entity10 amount to a " cold peace , " @entity98 said			1
president @entity200 said recently that @entity4 was " very helpful on a range of tough issues , " but prodded the @entity0 leader to take steps toward reform			1
" you can see these pent - up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets , " @entity200 said			0
he urged the @entity0 government to avoid resorting to violence to put down the recent demonstrations , adding , " i think it 's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances			2
" @entity47 said the @entity49 has seen " the barrier of fear " removed since the events in @entity23			0
" arabs really no longer feel terrified of the security apparatus " in @entity0 and elsewhere , he said			0
" we 're going to have a new era of politics			0

@entity4 ruled @entity0 for nearly 30 years , surviving would - be assassins , ill health
he was a major player in @entity49 politics , helping *enforce* the @entity15 accords with @entity10
@entity4 did n't allow political dissent , and had a questionable economic track record
@entity4 's fall signals the start of a new era in @entity20 politics
