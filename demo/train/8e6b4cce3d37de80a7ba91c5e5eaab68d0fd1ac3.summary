-- unlike @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 , @entity1 does not use the euro single currency , but it is afflicted by similar debt problems			1
fears are now growing that @entity1 could go bankrupt , prompting it to request help from the @entity10 and the @entity11			1
so is @entity1 the next step on @entity14 's path to meltdown ? how much does @entity1 owe ? it is eastern @entity14 's most indebted nation , with a debt - to - gdp ratio of 80 %			1
despite receiving a $ 15.8 billion loan by the @entity11 in 2008 , the country is now asking for more			2
it needs up to $ 25 billion in loans just to stablilize the struggling forint currency , but this will only go so far			0
other countries such as @entity4 and the @entity26 have similar or higher debt levels , but as @entity30 , former head of market analyis at the @entity32 , points out , his country is more at risk because its savings are much lower and it is more reliant on foreign investment			0
what does this mean ? the net effect is that @entity1 is paying an unsustainable 10 % premium over one year to service its debts			1
if @entity41 defaults on its debts , banks in eurozone countries , @entity45 in particular , whose banks ' balance sheets which be hit			0
this could trigger the " contagion " effect which has been so destabilizing to the eurozone countries			0
@entity1 's problems were compounded when its credit rating was junked by the major ratings agencies , meaning its debt is now regarded as high risk and making it more expensive to raise money to refinance existing obligations			1
will @entity1 get its loans ? not necessarily			2
the @entity10 says @entity1 is failing to cut its budget deficit fast enough , as it has demanded with other countries seeking bailouts			1
the situation is complicated by the fact that the @entity10 is threatening to take @entity1 to the @entity65 over that country 's new constitution that critics say undermines the independence of key state institutions , rigs the electoral system and curbs press freedoms			1
both the @entity10 and @entity11 say they will refuse to extend aid to @entity41 unless the government there guarantees the independence of the central bank			1
the heads of both those institutions spoke out over fears proposed reforms will give the @entity1 government undue influence over monetary policy			2
how did this situation come about ? current @entity1 prime minister @entity87 came to power in april 2010 with a landslide victory that meant his @entity91 party could rule without coalition partners for the first time since the fall of communism			2
armed with a comfortable two thirds majority in parliament , the new government set about cutting red tape			0
but critics say that after less than two years in power , @entity87 's iron grip over crucial ( and supposedly independent ) institutions is tightening			0
the changes to the constitution enacted over the new year have sparked protests in the country amid concerns they will curtail freedom of the press			0
so will @entity1 change course ? the @entity1 government has indicated it is ready to meet some of the criticisms of the @entity10 and @entity11 but critics say it is taking an isolationist position			1
former first deputy foreign minister @entity117 , who helped steer @entity1 towards @entity10 accession in 2004 , told @entity0 he believed this approach was doomed			1
" you can not run such a small country in the middle of @entity14 by claiming an independence war against everybody around you , " he told @entity0			2
the government has " declared a freedom fight against international institutions like the @entity11 , " said @entity117 , while at home , " it has systematically dismantled the checks and balances of independent institutions			2
" with the current set up @entity1 risks a " catastrophe , " he warned			0
what will happen next ? the government had two strategies , said @entity137 : to cut debt and boost growth			0
" neither worked , " he said			0
the @entity142 had asked @entity1 to cut its debt to gdp ratio by half a percentage point , but it in fact rose by several points			1
" the high - risk premium shows a lack of confidence in the markets about @entity1			2
people are starting to take money out of banks and put it into foreign currency , and open accounts abroad			0
" there are now two outcomes : @entity1 will go bust , said @entity137 , or it must " surrender and accept all conditions of the @entity11 and the @entity10			1
" former minister @entity117 agreed , and urged @entity161 to either change his domestic policies now or resign			0
failing that , he said , the @entity91 had a duty to oust their leader at the next parliamentary vote .			0
