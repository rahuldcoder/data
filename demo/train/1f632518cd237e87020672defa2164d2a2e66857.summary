@entity0 -- keenly conscious of his image , a graying @entity5 no doubt never expected this video -- showing him hunched over , draped in a blanket and using a television clicker -- to hit the world 's airwaves as it did saturday			1
@entity15 by a confidant , the @entity13 leader contrasts with the younger version of himself on a tv screen a few feet away			0
that man has a more youthful beard , a hand held up in resolve and a photo of the burning @entity23			0
@entity25 officials , who saturday released five videos , emphasized the recordings and other materials seized at @entity5 's @entity30 compound show the terrorist still had a firm hand at the tiller , managing strategic and tactical control of his organization , even as he stayed out of sight in @entity37			1
the undated videos make clear @entity5 " remained active in @entity13 terrorist propaganda operations , especially in shaping his own image , " said a senior intelligence official granted anonymity under the ground rules of a briefing at the @entity46			2

" besides the missing audio , the videos , according to the intelligence official , were not altered in any other way			0
still , the release of the home movies sends a message to those who doubted @entity5 was killed : @entity69 got footage that likely could have been held only by @entity5 at his hideout			1
it may also have accomplished something else : diminishing the @entity5 mythology of invincibility			2
video shows new side of @entity5 @entity1 national security contributor @entity78 said @entity25 officials " picked these videos pretty deliberately			1
" portions are unflattering of @entity5 and reflect his vanity , @entity82 said			2
some of the videos indicate problems with production value			0
@entity5 misses a cue in one and another shows him with a wrinkled backdrop			2

analysts have pored over them for evidence of further plots or operations			0
@entity122 withered after 9/11 " the materials reviewed over the past several days clearly show that @entity5 remained an active leader in @entity13 , providing strategic , operational and tactical instructions to the group , " the intelligence official said			0
" though separated from many @entity13 members who are located in more remote areas of the region , he was far from a figurehead			0
he was an active player making the recent operation even more essential for our nation 's security			0
" but @entity25 officials would not describe any of that material in detail saturday			1
they did say that the intelligence reveals @entity5 and @entity13 had a driving interest in taking on the @entity25 and that the leader was involved in the details of plotting attacks			1
@entity5 's bride , 18 , was confident , conservative one of the videos is a message to the @entity25 officials believe was recorded in october or november and is entitled " a message to the @entity149			1
" in that video , which had not been broadcast by @entity13 , @entity5 's beard has been dyed black and he was well - composed as he delivered his message			1
the three other videos are practice sessions for videos he was planning to release to the world			0
in one , @entity5 stands in front of an armoire			0

the intelligence officials said they are trying to determine what @entity5 's death means to the future of @entity13 and are trying to get clues to the locations of the other top @entity13 leaders			2
the no. 2 man in @entity13 is @entity195 ; another top militant is @entity197 , the @entity25 born militant who is a leader in the group 's @entity199 branch			2
this week , @entity197 eluded a drone attack in southern @entity199 as security personnel continue their hunt for him , @entity199 and @entity25 officials said			1
