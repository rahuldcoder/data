@entity0 -- @entity3 's nuclear watchdog on wednesday said a toxic water leak at the tsunami - damaged @entity6 power plant has been classified as a level 3 " serious incident " on an international scale			1
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) said it had made the decision after consulting with the @entity14 - based @entity13 , said @entity15 , a spokesman for the regulator			1
as news emerged last week of the leak of hundreds of tons of radioactive water from a storage tank , the @entity11 said it was planning to issue the alert , its gravest warning since the massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that sent three reactors at the plant into meltdown			1
the leak had previously been assigned a level 1 " anomaly rating " on the @entity34 , which ranges from zero , for no safety threat , to seven , for a major accident like the meltdowns			0
the decision to issue the level 3 alert came two days after a @entity3 government minister had compared the plant operator 's efforts to deal with worrying toxic water leaks at the site to a game of " whack - a - mole			1
" @entity44 , the industry minister , said monday after visiting the plant that " from now on , the government is going to step forward			1
" his ministry has been tasked by prime minister @entity48 to come up with measures to tackle the mounting problems at @entity6			0
@entity51 looks for outside help to stabilize @entity6 huge volumes of toxic water the plant operator , @entity51 ( @entity51 ) , has been struggling to deal with the high volume of contaminated water at the plant			1
last month , @entity51 admitted that radioactive groundwater was leaking into the @entity59 from the site , bypassing an underground barrier built to seal in the water			0
about 400 tons of groundwater flow into the site each day , and @entity51 also pumps large amounts water through the buildings to keep the crippled reactors cool			2
@entity68 tuna study finds miniscule health risks the operator has stored hundreds of thousands of tons of the contaminated water in huge tanks at the site			1
there are now about 1,000 of the containers , 93 % of which are already full of radioactive water			0
around 350 of the tanks were built as temporary storage units in the aftermath of the meltdowns			2
but more than two years later , they are still being used			0
it was one of those makeshift tanks where the leak was detected , setting off the latest crisis			0
@entity51 says it has transferred the remaining tainted water from the faulty tank to another container			0
but it has n't said what caused the leak in the first place			0
@entity3 ponders freezing ground @entity1 's @entity92 reported from @entity0 , and @entity93 wrote from @entity94 .			2

the alert is @entity3 's gravest warning since meltdowns at the nuclear plant in 2011
