-- @entity3 military leaders are " angry " and " ashamed " over sexual assaults plaguing the armed forces , president @entity1 said thursday after ordering top @entity7 officials to " leave no stone unturned " in the effort to stop the abuse			1
the president 's comments came the same day legislation was introduced in @entity14 to ease the victims ' quest for justice , a move that followed news this month of two high - profile cases involving sexual assault in the military -- allegedly by the very service members tasked with preventing such crimes			1
@entity1 summoned defense secretary @entity25 and @entity27 gen. @entity26 , chairman of the @entity28			1
he told the two that it was imperative they find a solution to the abuse that is undermining trust in the military			1
" not only is it a crime			2
not only is it shameful and disgraceful			2
but it is also going to make our military less effective than it can be , " @entity1 told reporters after the meeting			1
" as such , it is dangerous to our national security			0
so this is not a sideshow			0
... this goes to the heart and core of who we are and how effective we 're going to be			0
" during the meeting , @entity1 heard from @entity52 , @entity26 and other @entity7 leaders : " they care about this			1
they 're angry about it			0
i heard directly from all of them that they 're ashamed by some of what 's happened			2
" survey shows troubling trend in military sexual assault the military has been hit hard over the issue of sexual assault among its ranks , with the @entity7 this month releasing results of a survey that found there were an estimated 26,000 cases of unwanted sexual contact , which ranged from rape to groping , among troops in 2012			1
the findings were a 35 % jump from the estimated 19,300 cases in the 2010 report , the @entity7 said			1
the alarming figures were released as two cases under investigation brought the problem to front and center in media reports			2
an @entity27 sergeant first class assigned to the sexual assault prevention unit at @entity88 , @entity89 , is being investigated for alleged sexual assault , pandering , abusive sexual contact and maltreatment of subordinates			1
the military has not identified the soldier , but said he has been relieved of duty while investigators look in to the allegations			2
after officer charged , military officials face tough questioning in early may , an @entity103 officer who worked with an assault prevention unit was charged with sexual battery and removed from duty			1
he is accused of grabbing a woman and groping her buttocks and breasts in an @entity111 parking lot not far from his @entity113 office			0
on thursday , the head of the sexual harassment prevention unit for the @entity117 at @entity118 , @entity119 , was relieved of duty after he was arrested in a domestic dispute			1
" this is a domestic matter between a man and wife , " said @entity27 spokesman @entity122			0
lt. col. @entity128 turned himself in to @entity129 , @entity130 , police on allegations of violating an order of protection and stalking , police spokesman @entity126 said			0
@entity52 has said he 's disgusted over the most recent allegations and has called for a re-evaluation of how service members are chosen to work in sexual assault prevention units			1
he 's ordered that everyone who currently works in those units be retrained and rescreened , and that they have to earn their credentials again			2
what are the sexual assault prevention units ? the president 's order came as @entity149 sen. @entity148 of @entity150 introduced legislation thursday that would remove what is known as chain of command from a process that victims have to go through to get their claims heard			1
@entity148 wants to give military prosecutors the power to decide whether cases are investigated			1
the current system of reporting often works like this : when someone wants to report that they 've been violated , that person typically goes to commanders who decide whether the claim is legitimate and can be passed along for further investigation			0
the system , the senator asserts , opens the victim up to retaliation			0
@entity148 and others feel that a commander can not be an impartial figure and may be inclined to protect not just the victim but the perpetrator who is also his or her subordinate			0
" when we just talk ( to victims ) informally , they tell us they do n't report because they are afraid of retaliation , being marginalized , having their careers end or being blamed , " she said on @entity0 's the lead with @entity180			1
" and so what we have to do is create a different dynamic so they feel more comfortable reporting			0
" the military defines unwanted sexual contact as sexual crimes prohibited by military law , from rape to abusive sexual contact			1
of those estimated 26,000 cases in the @entity7 survey , only 3,374 came forward to report an alleged sexual crime in 2012			1
while that disparity is clear ; the lower number still marks a 6 % increase in the report of alleged sexual crimes compared with 2011 , the report showed			2
at a thursday press conference , survivors of sexual assault spoke about the hell they 've been through and how difficult it was to have their cases investigated			1
retired air force technical sgt. @entity209 said she thought it was a better option to " suck it up " than to report being assaulted			0
" i did not want to be stigmatized for reporting my assaults as i tried to move forward in my career , " she said			2
" instead the best option for me was to try and endure it , to suck it up , and try and make it till i could get transferred somewhere else only to have it happen over and over again like a recurring nightmare			0
" @entity219 began to weep			0
former navy petty officer third class @entity220 was stationed in @entity222 when he was raped , he told reporters			0
" after the rape , i was told by my command not to file a formal report with the @entity227 , " he said			0
" when i was reassigned to seek medical help , my psychiatrist told me that i was lying about my rape and diagnosed me with a personality disorder			0
" @entity220 was discharged in august 2001			0
" i have been fighting to correct my record ever since , " he said			0
@entity0 : listening to two victims @entity0 's @entity234 , @entity180 , @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			2
