@entity0 -- as portions of the @entity10 world struggle to extinguish decades of oppression and dictorial rule , the rights and opportunities for women in these societies stand at a delicate precipice , @entity3 officials told a @entity15 foreign relations subcommittee wednesday			1
" this is not a favor to women , it is not simply a nice thing to do , " @entity16 , ambassador - at - large for @entity17 , said at a hearing called to examine the role of women in the aftermath of the @entity22			1
