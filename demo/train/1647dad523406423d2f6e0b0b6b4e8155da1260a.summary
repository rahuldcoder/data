-- @entity2 's former marching band director is speaking out for the first time since the university fired him over the band 's overly sexual culture			1
@entity7 was fired in july after a university investigation concluded he " should have known about sexual harassment that created a hostile environment			1
" @entity7 told @entity0 affiliate @entity11 on tuesday that he was " absolutely shocked by the one - sidedness of the report , " and called his firing a " rush to judgment			1
" he also said that despite the school 's conclusion to the contrary , he was sanitizing the marching band 's historically tawdry culture that he first experienced as a sousaphone player in the 1990s			2
" that cultural change is also evident in the many , many letters from current and former band members , which attest to @entity7 's efforts and concrete success at moving the band 's culture in a positive direction , " his attorney , @entity22 , said tuesday			1
the investigation 's report , released july 23 , told of bawdy band member nicknames and @entity36 © traditions such as the " midnight ramp , " in which band members entered the stadium through a ramp wearing only their underwear			2
@entity22 said @entity7 knew about some of the band 's bad behavior , but he said he did " everything he possibly could to end it			1
" " you know he experienced inappropriate behavior as a rookie band member himself			0
he was deeply affected by it and that 's why as band director he did everything he could to stop anything inappropriate , " he said			0
the attorney said @entity7 " left the band with a far improved culture from the one that he inherited , " and slammed the report that ousted him			1
" had ( investigators ) chosen to talk with a representative sample of students and alumni , rather than its hand - picked , isolated sample , its conclusions would have been far different , " he said			0
" the former director has yet to produce any factual examples that demonstrate any tangible attempts to change the band culture , " said @entity71 , an @entity2 spokesman			0
" in fact , the former director himself acknowledged that he knew of the nicknames both as a student member of the band and as its director			0
" but @entity7 said " the university found no tangible evidence of cultural change because it conveniently chose not to look			0
" @entity2 also appointed two interim band leaders tuesday			0
attorney : band director was wrongly fired over ' flawed ' report			2
