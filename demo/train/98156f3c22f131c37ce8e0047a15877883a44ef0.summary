-- it was not too long ago -- in 2001 , prior to the @entity3 invasion -- that @entity5 's women were all but entirely marginalized			1
with strict @entity9 laws in place , half the country 's populace was barred from practically every aspect of public life , from education to voting and most occupations			0
@entity5 women , under the @entity9 , were n't even allowed to leave their homes without a male escort , and the mandatory burqa became a visual symbol of the regime 's all - encompassing oppression			1
the country still has a long way to go , but giant strides have been made since the @entity9 was scattered and broken under the might of the @entity3 and allied military			0
women 's rights were guaranteed under the new , post-taliban constitution , but there remains a gulf in terms of what is written and what is practiced			1
@entity5 remains far from an equal , open society , and outside the capital , @entity37 , conservative values still reign			2
in some parts of the hinterland , the old rules still apply , even if they are no longer being enforced by the @entity9			0
however , there are indications that women have taken hugely positive steps towards , if not yet equality , a much more active role in the running of the country			0
and their influence has largely been welcomed			0
one of saturday 's frontrunners , @entity52 , sees the engagement of the country 's women as vital to its development			1
" if you want to see this country or any other country even being able to deal with the challenges and develop , it can not happen without the role of half the population , " he told @entity58 's independent newspaper			0
since voter registration for saturday 's elections started almost a year ago , 2.5 million names were added to the electoral roll			1
of these , over half were women , according to the @entity71 of @entity5			2
this level of engagement is unprecedented in @entity5 , and shows that women are a hugely significant demographic that needs to be courted			1
" i am here to vote today			0
it 's a day to decide about the future of @entity5 and i would like to ask all women to break their silence and take one step towards progress			1
if they do n't want to do it for themselves they should do it for future generations , " one female voter told @entity5 's state news agency @entity85			1
there are positive signs from the leading candidates , with all three frontrunners pledging to allow women a greater role in government , vowing to support women 's rights in their campaign speeches			1
and while it could be seen as a cynical vote - grabbing move , women 's names are also appearing on the ballot , something that would have been unimaginable only 13 years ago			1
there were three female vice-presidential candidates on saturday 's ballot , although only one , @entity108 , the former governor of @entity110 province , is on the ticket of a realistic frontrunner			1
campaigning alongside @entity113 , the establishment candidate , @entity108 represents the potential that @entity5 women have to offer			1
although it 's looking unlikely , should returns show success for @entity120 -- official results are n't expected for weeks -- @entity108 's role as one of his lieutenants would truly be a historic achievement			2
@entity131 's picking of a female running - mate was " a victory , " @entity127 , a member of @entity128 and women 's rights activist told @entity0			1
" of course it will have a direct impact for the life of women in @entity5			2
for me it 's not enough			0
we want women to be in every layer of power			0
" i believe in ten years we can have a female president			0
the way @entity5 is improving , the way women ( have ) come out , and turned out , the way women voted ... that gives me more energy -- that @entity5 is ready to have a female president in the near future			1
" on @entity154 , the formerly @entity3 - based candidate @entity153 addressed a rally in @entity37 which was attended by thousands of women			0
uniquely for electioneering in this part of the world , his wife @entity157 , a @entity158 - @entity3 and a @entity159 , spoke as well			0
@entity164 's wife , in contrast , was rarely if ever seen in public			0
at the next level of governance , there is further evidence of a burgeoning female movement , with female candidates popping up all over the country			1
around 300 female candidates are contesting seats on provincial councils -- a record number			1
" the women 's vote will not any more be a ' ghost vote ' which has time after time been abused by men			2
this is a kind of message that @entity5 have woken up			0
it 's also a clear message that @entity5 society has changed , " says @entity127 , who eschews the burqa that all women had to wear pre- 2001 , instead typically wearing a more relaxed headscarf loosely on her dark hair			2
" the women of @entity5 ... have shown how brave they are			2
" her confidence has also been transmitted to her daughter : too young to vote but full of optimism about the future of her country , and the place of women in it			2
@entity0 's @entity199 asked her what she imagined the coming years could hold			0
" honestly a bright future , a future that is good for us , good for all the people , for girls , good for women -- you know , a bright future ! " she said .			0

women an *increasingly* influential demographic in @entity5 politics
all three frontrunners in saturday 's election have pledged to support women 's rights
@entity108 , @entity5 's first female governor , again makes history as vice-presidential candidate
optimism of female candidates is transmitted to the next generation
