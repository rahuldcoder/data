once president @entity9 signs the new tobacco bill , the tobacco industry will be subject to federal regulation			1
president @entity9 on monday signed a bill that gives the @entity14 power to regulate the manufacturing , marketing and sale of tobacco			1
anti-tobacco activists champion the legislation as a historic step forward for public health , but even some who have fought tobacco concede that the tobacco companies scored some wins in the final legislation			1
" it 's a great victory for the public health community , but i would not overestimate the demise of the tobacco industry and their ability to lobby , " said @entity28 , vice president of national policy and advocacy for the @entity31			1
in the past century , the tobacco industry has been distinctive in its ability to avoid coming under the authority of the @entity14 , while almost every other consumer product has been subject to federal regulation			1
@entity42 voted in 1965 to require all cigarette packages to carry warning labels , a warning that was made under the surgeon general 's name five years later			0
the legislation @entity42 approved this month , known as the @entity49 , would give the @entity14 power to ban candy and fruit - flavored cigarettes , widely considered appealing to first - time smokers , including youths			2
it would prohibit tobacco companies from using terms such as " low tar , " " light " or " mild , " require larger warning labels on packages that show pictures of the effects of tobacco use and restrict advertising of tobacco products			0
it also would require tobacco companies to reduce levels of nicotine in cigarettes			0
similar legislation , introduced by sen. @entity73 , @entity74 , more than a decade ago , failed to make it through @entity42			0

" @entity84 , a longtime anti-tobacco advocate and director of the @entity86 at the @entity87 , said the public health community has made " gigantic progress " over the past few decades , but he sees the @entity14 bill as a win for @entity91 , the nation 's biggest cigarette company			1

" basically , the public health people cut a deal with @entity91			2
" @entity91 , which is owned by @entity107 , was the only major tobacco company to endorse the legislation , although the company has expressed some @entity112 reservations about parts of it			1
@entity84 argues that the legislation legitimizes the tobacco industry at a time when " legitimacy was being lost			2
" his biggest complaint : the bill creates a 12 - member advisory board through which all regulations will flow			0
tobacco industry representatives will hold three nonvoting seats			0
" putting three guys on this committee would be a little bit like putting three mobsters on the @entity132 committee on organized crime , " @entity84 said , echoing the sentiment of other strong tobacco - control advocates			2
@entity78 said one of its early objections to the legislation was that @entity91 had a role in crafting it			1
