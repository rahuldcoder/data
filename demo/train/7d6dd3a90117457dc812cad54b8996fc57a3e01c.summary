the relationship between @entity1 and @entity2 is the barometer of the political health of @entity5			2
even in a @entity8 of 27 member states , and which has expanded far beyond the original six countries founding the union , @entity7 - @entity2 relations are the drivers of @entity5 's politics			1
this means that changes in the leadership of either country matter -- and the personal chemistry between the @entity2 chancellor and the @entity1 president have wider ramifications for @entity5			0
the election of @entity24 as the new @entity1 president has created an uncertainty in the relationship between @entity5 's two leading states			1
@entity24 is a socialist elected on a platform of opposition to the @entity8 austerity and euro stabilization program			1
the problem for @entity7 - @entity2 relations is that the program was agreed by @entity24 's predecessor @entity36 with the @entity2 chancellor @entity37			1
this creates a political dislocation at the heart of the @entity8 , just as the euro is under renewed pressure with the scenario of a @entity45 exit from the currency becoming all too possible			0
can this @entity7 - @entity2 rift be mended ? both leaders will do their best to appear publicly in agreement and the first meeting between the two leaders this week was all smiles			0
but both leaders have limited room for maneuver			1
the @entity1 public voted decisively against a program of austerity in electing @entity24 -- and @entity1 faces elections to its @entity60 next month			1
the president will be seeking a working majority for his socialist party			0
now will not be a moment for @entity24 to publicly backtrack			0
@entity37 faces her own domestic political difficulties			0
the @entity2 people are hostile to expanded support for eurozone economies in difficulty , such as @entity45 and @entity70 , and there is a possible bailout for @entity70 looming			2
in state elections in @entity2 at the weekend @entity37 's party suffered an electoral setback , losing control of @entity2 's most populous state to the opposition @entity79			1
the @entity2 public appears to dislike @entity37 's austerity program at home but is also strongly resistant to supporting the economies of other states such as @entity1 , which are asking for @entity2 to take measures to stimulate the wider @entity5 economy			1
and a general election is on the horizon in @entity2 next year			2
the stakes for the @entity8 of a difficult @entity7 - @entity2 relationship are high			2
a credible plan to preserve the eurozone remains elusive , with @entity1 and @entity2 's agreement on a common course of action looking difficult to broker			2
the rescue of the eurozone is a political and economic challenge of a magnitude that the @entity8 has not faced since its creation in the 1950s and neither @entity37 nor @entity24 look to be leaders who have the capacity for the bold leadership on @entity5 integration that their predecessors demonstrated across successive decades			1
other @entity5 leaders from @entity5 's smaller states will be pressing them hard to demonstrate decisive leadership			0
in the absence of a strong @entity113 engagement with the @entity8 , and @entity70 and @entity115 's leaders preoccupied with the precarious condition of their own economies , there are no other candidates for the leadership role in @entity5			0
@entity37 and @entity24 are by default the only credible leadership team in @entity5 and their developing relationship carries the burden of @entity5 's future			1
whether they are now able to move on from their " first date " this week to build a successful political marriage is the key to the @entity8 's capacity to navigate its way out of its current crisis			0
a dysfunctional relationship between the two leaders will see the @entity8 's current crisis prolonged .			0

@entity137 says the election of @entity24 has created uncertainty
both @entity24 and @entity37 have limited room for maneuver , he says
the @entity2 public " appears to dislike @entity37 's austerity program "
a eurozone rescue is a challenge the @entity8 has not faced since its creation , says @entity137
