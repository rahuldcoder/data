@entity0 -- when @entity4 vice president @entity3 called @entity6 's territorial claims on a group of @entity9 island " a farce , " he echoed national sentiment of protesters who took to the streets in @entity15 protests in recent weeks			1
" @entity21 should rein in its behavior , not utter any words and prevent any acts that undermine @entity4 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , " said @entity3 -- who is expected to become @entity4 's new president next month -- at a wednesday meeting with @entity19 defense secretary @entity18 , state media reported			1
as @entity29 's presumptive new leader wades into the @entity21 - @entity4 dispute , analysts say the stakes are being raised in a dispute that is largely being led by nationalist fervor rather than government policy or underlining economic interests			1
and the @entity36 that usually follows these territorial disputes is muddied by the leadership change in @entity29 expected next month			1
" this is where it 's becoming dangerous , " said @entity39 , defense expert at the @entity40			0
" no incoming @entity4 leader can be perceived to be weak on territorial claims			2
" on monday , the @entity46 said two @entity4 surveillance ships entered its territorial waters , while 10 other @entity4 ships patrolled nearby			2
meanwhile , @entity4 announced sunday it was postponing planned celebrations later this month marking the 40th anniversary of normalization of relations between @entity29 and @entity6			1
the bellicose rhetoric also charts the rise of an assertive @entity4 and a sea change in the forces shaping @entity59 politics that are writ small in the battle over the uninhabited island chain , known as @entity62 in @entity4 and @entity62 in @entity21			1
" @entity4 's feeling more confident both in its position and in its right to the area both legally and politically , " @entity67 , a fellow at the @entity68 and expert on the @entity71 dispute			2
" and nationalism in @entity4 has gained strength and influencing the government			0
" rising tensions in @entity4 waters the @entity77 is n't the only flashpoint for territorial tensions among @entity4 and its neighbors			1
the @entity71 is dotted with hundreds of largely uninhabited islands and coral atolls , many of which have competing claims from @entity4 , @entity86 , the @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			0
just like the friction with @entity21 , there have been increasing incidents of tension between @entity4 and its @entity71 neighbors over island claims			1
in 2011 , @entity86 claimed that @entity4 patrol boats cut cables from @entity100 boats during oil and gas surveys in disputed waters			0
@entity29 said that @entity86 vessels have been illegally surveying in @entity4 waters and harassing @entity4 fishing boats			1
the same year @entity87 also reported boats cutting cables of a survey ship and threatening to ram its boats			0
" a lot of this would n't be happening if @entity4 was n't becoming more assertive and being more confident , and that 's one important issue why all these issues are becoming more salient , " @entity113 said			2
the difference in the @entity77 is the collective might of @entity4 and @entity21 , the second and third largest economies in the world , respectively			1
" when you have two major nation states involved , it 's more dangerous than the ( @entity71 ) , " @entity113 said			0
a nationalist wave the often violent protests that broke out in dozens of @entity4 cities -- from @entity129 in the south to @entity131 in the north -- came to a head after the @entity21 government bought the disputed islands from the @entity21 family that have privately owned the islands on september 11 for 2.05 billion yen ( us $ 26.2 million )			1
dozens of @entity21 factories and businesses temporarily shut their doors in the wake of the violence as angry crowds overturned @entity21 brand cars and looted @entity21 stores in some areas			0
the island dispute , which traces back centuries , have reached diplomatic boiling points in 1996 , 2005 and most recently in 2010 , when a @entity4 boat allegedly rammed a @entity21 patrol boat , resulting in the arrest of the @entity4 sailors			1
" i do n't think anyone thought the @entity4 reaction would have been as strong as it was , and i do n't think anyone expected the level of violence that we saw , especially looking at past incidents , " said @entity156 , an expert on maritime disputes at the @entity158 in @entity159 , @entity160			2
the " nationalization " of the islands infuriated @entity4 , although analysts say @entity6 's move was an effort to wrest the issue away from @entity21 nationalists , led by @entity6 governor @entity173 who launched an online appeal to buy the islands			1
donations poured in , prompting a sharp rebuke from @entity4 and forcing the @entity21 government to wade into the dispute with its own offer for the contested land			1
" if you 're interested in stability , the @entity21 government is better than owning the islands than a group of nationalists , because who knows how they might raise tensions , " @entity156 said			2
" ( prime minister ) @entity191 's calculation is , this is going to explode in the short - run , in the long run it 's better			0
" economic interests although nationalistic ardor on both sides of the dispute have brought the current situation to a boil , national interest in the territory can be traced to a 1969 @entity205 geological survey that contains this tantalizing line : " a high probability exists that the continental shelf between @entity90 and @entity21 may be one of the most prolific oil reserves in the world			0
" also under its @entity71 lie potentially huge reserves of natural gas and oil			0
a @entity4 estimate suggests as much as 213 billion barrels of oil lie untapped in the @entity71 - which , if true , would make it the largest oil reserves outside of @entity221 , according to the @entity222			0
at the heart of all these island disputes in @entity225 is a term of international maritime law known as " @entity228 , " where nations are allowed sole rights to fish and develop resources within 200 nautical miles of a country 's shores			0
that has created interest in nation 's grabbing uninhabited islands - often little more than rocky atolls - to thereby extend their zone			0
" the area is starting to look a little bit like @entity244 , at first looked worthless , now may not be worthless , " @entity241 said			0
" the @entity77 is virtually all continental shelf , which means it 's all relatively easy digging except in typhoon season			0
" but the likelihood the areas will be developed dwindles as the political storm brews between @entity4 and @entity21			1
if this fracas follows past contretemps , the two sides will cool for a few months before rapprochement from high - level officials on both sides			0
but with the leadership change coming in @entity4 , and leadership elections imminent in @entity21 's two major parties , the likelihood is tensions will remain high			1
" no one wants to be perceived as soft on @entity4 , " @entity156 said			0
meanwhile , as historic enmities over @entity21 's war past inflame tensions in @entity4 , public sentiment is changing in @entity21 toward @entity4			2
" the result is the average @entity21 person views @entity4 with more suspicion than the past , " @entity156 said			2
" you can now be anti-china in @entity21 and not be conservative , which is a development that i think took @entity29 by surprise			2

analysts : @entity274 , not economics , is driving the dispute between @entity29 and @entity6
leadership change in @entity4 next month will likely keep the issue boiling for longer
rising might and confidence of @entity29 also at play in growing territorial disputes
nationalists in @entity21 have been driving @entity6 moves on the @entity62 / @entity62 dispute
