the @entity0 says power outages created by recent storms in the @entity3 and @entity4 cut blood donations , which were already low this summer			1
in june there was a nationwide shortfall , with donations down more than 10 % across the country			1
" we are asking people to please call 1 - 800 - red - cross or visit us at @entity14 to find a way to donate if they can , " said @entity10 , @entity0 director of biomedical communications			1
" we need people 's help			2
" one group that would like to help , but legally ca n't , may be moving one step closer to eligibility			0
since the 1980s , when the @entity23 epidemic decimated their community , gay men -- or @entity26 ( men who have sex with men ) as they are called by federal agencies -- have not been allowed to donate blood			1
in june , a group of 64 @entity34 legislators led by rep. @entity35 , @entity36 , and sen. @entity37 , @entity38 , sent a letter to the @entity40 encouraging it to move forward with a study that may lead to the end of the decades - old ban			1
" we remain concerned that a blanket deferral of @entity46 for any length of time both perpetuates the unwarranted discrimination against the bisexual and gay community and prevents healthy men from donating blood without a definitive finding of added benefit to the safety of the blood supply , " the letter said			1
@entity58 lifts ban on lesbians giving blood " this is a matter of life and death and we are turning away over 50,000 healthy men who want to donate blood , " @entity35 told @entity60			1
" a straight person who has unsafe sex with multiple partners can give blood , and that creates a greater risk than a gay person in a monogamous relationship			1
" the policy started at a time when people did n't know how the deadly virus that causes @entity23 spread			2
at the time , there was n't a good test to detect whether @entity79 was present in donated blood , and @entity79 was getting into the nation 's blood supply			1
they knew this because hemophiliacs who were getting blood transfusions started showing symptoms of @entity23			2
what scientists also knew was that a disproportionate number of gay men were affected by the virus			1
to eliminate risk , the @entity93 added a screening question to the federal guidelines			0
blood banks were instructed to ask male donors if they had had sex with a man , even once , since 1977			2
the @entity93 regards 1977 as the beginning of the @entity23 epidemic in the @entity34			1
if the potential donor responded " yes , " he would automatically be removed from the donor pool for life			0
no similar questions were asked to screen out donors who engaged in other potentially risky sexual behavior			0
donors were n't asked about the number of partners they had , nor were they asked if their sexual partners had engaged in unprotected sex with other @entity79 positive partners			0
" while the @entity0 is obligated by law to follow the @entity93 guidelines , we continue to work with the @entity118 ( formerly known as the @entity118 ) to push through policies that would be much more fair and consistent among donors who engage in similar risk activities , " @entity10 said			0
scientists can now screen for most instances of @entity79 within days of infection , and the nation 's blood banks have called a lifetime ban " medically and scientifically unwarranted			2
" men who have sex with men still are disproportionately affected by the virus and account for nearly half the approximately 1.2 million people living with @entity79 in the @entity34 , according to the @entity134			1
but it is a person 's behavior , not their sexual orientation , that puts them at risk say health experts			0
while he is a gay man , @entity142 thinks he would be the perfect candidate to donate blood			1
he does n't use iv drugs			0
he even educates people on how to prevent new hiv infections as a regular volunteer educator with @entity149 in @entity150 , @entity151			2
he thinks his exclusion is unfair			0
" yes , gay men are still a high - risk community , but so are minority women , and there are no standards prohibiting them from donating			1
there would be rightful outrage against that kind of blanket population ban , " @entity142 said			2
" i am banned based on one reason only , my sexual orientation			0
" when @entity142 went to donate at a blood drive on the @entity167 a few years ago , he said he knew what likely would happen when the nurses asked the sexual history question			2
" i did know what i was getting into , but i was shocked by how it felt to be rejected , " he said			0
" it was almost like they thought i was n't important enough to give blood , like because i was gay i did n't count			2
it was a horrible feeling			0
" parts of @entity178 lift lifetime ban on gay men donating blood @entity181 with @entity182 , an aids service organization , said @entity142 normally would be the type of donor blood banks are hungry for			1
studies show those who give blood when they are young become regular lifetime donors , something most blood banks are struggling to find these days			1
@entity182 has been fighting to change the ban for years			0
in 2010 @entity182 joined a coalition of other nonprofits to encourage @entity193 to send a letter to @entity40 to end the ban , which some members of congress did			1
in june of that year , @entity40 brought together an independent panel of experts			0
the @entity200 on @entity201 and @entity202 reviewed the policy and decided to keep it and concluded the ban was " suboptimal , " because it allows high - risk individuals to donate while keeping low - risk donors out			2
however , the expert committee also concluded " available scientific data are inadequate to support change to a specific alternate policy			0
" the panel suggested the policy not be changed and recommended further evaluation			0
@entity40 then promised to conduct feasibility studies to determine if there was a subset of the gay male population that would pose little or no threat to the blood supply			1
" we finally got them to stop defending the policy at the very least , which was pretty significant , " @entity181 said			0
the @entity40 is still determining the criteria for which part of the population to study			0
@entity182 suggested the population to consider should include gay men who have had only one sex partner in the past six months			1
@entity232 and @entity233 , two countries with more progressive donor policies , hold everyone to that standard regardless of sexual orientation			0
@entity181 takes the point one step further			0
" a straight person could donate today after having unprotected sex with hundreds of partners , and in the @entity34 they wo n't ask about that behavior , " he said			1
he added that four out of five gay men are @entity79 negative , which he estimated means 2 million additional people could be blood donors			1
a 2010 study by the @entity248 at the @entity249 estimated that if gay men who had not had sexual contact for the past 12 months were allowed to donate blood , more than 53,000 additional men would likely make more than 89,000 blood donations			1
that number may seem small , but blood banks say it could help enormously , especially now , when blood supply shortages are common			0
after @entity142 was denied the chance to donate , he asked some of his friends to help him demonstrate outside the blood drive			2
they produced signs to raise awareness about the ban and distributed educational material			0
they also escorted people to the drive , because they wanted people to continue to donate			2
" a lot of people in the @entity273 assume you have @entity23 if you are a gay man , " he said			2
" we wanted them to understand that is not the case			0
we are banned based on an outdated policy			0
when people questioned us , i told them about how i always heard that people who donate blood are heroes			1
gay men want to be heroes , too			1
" should people be allowed to sell their organs ?			0

gay men prohibited from donating blood
in june , blood donations were down more than 10 %
studies show 1 in 5 people donate blood , *95* % of population will need donated blood
64 members of @entity193 are urging the @entity34 to end the ban
