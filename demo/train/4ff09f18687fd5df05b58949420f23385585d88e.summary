-- the crib in @entity4 's @entity3 home has sat empty for more than a year			0
and in suburban @entity6 , @entity5 has prepared a nursery for a baby that may never arrive			0
@entity10 has announced it will conduct a case - by - case review of every pending foreign adoption case			1
they and thousands of prospective parents , eager to adopt children from abroad , have found themselves in an emotional legal limbo since two of the most popular countries for international adoptions -- @entity10 and @entity20 -- recently halted their programs			1
now would - be mothers and fathers around the @entity24 wonder what will become of their quest to adopt a child -- a pursuit that can fray nerves , cost up to $ 30,000 and span several years			2
@entity10 announced this month that it would conduct a case - by - case review of every pending foreign adoption case			1
that put on hold the adoption plans of about 2,000 @entity24 families			2
the crackdown comes amid reports that some in @entity10 coerce mothers to relinquish their children for adoption -- or steal the children outright and present them as orphans			1
similar accusations have arisen in @entity20			2
after the @entity24 accused adoption agencies there of corruption and baby - selling , @entity20 said in april that it would no longer allow adoptions to the @entity24			1
" my husband and i were absolutely devastated , " @entity5 said			0
" adoptive parents have put a lot of emotional energy and a lot of financial resources in the process			0
" @entity20 's decision affects several hundred families			2
families in the @entity24 adopted 4,728 children from @entity10 and 828 from @entity20 last year			1
the halt in adoptions from those two nations unfolds against the backdrop of a dramatic rise in international adoptions in the @entity24			2
the number of foreign - born children adopted by @entity24 families more than tripled from 1990 to 2004 , when it reached a high of 22,884 , though the figure has declined slightly each year since			1
in 2007 , the @entity24 granted visas to 19,613 children so they could join an adoptive family in the @entity24 , according to @entity73 figures			2
about 70 percent of those children came from four countries : @entity76 , @entity10 , @entity77 and @entity78			2
a few other countries have also halted foreign adoptions at various times , including @entity82 and @entity83			0
yet the suspensions in @entity20 and @entity10 have had the biggest impact -- they 're two of the 10 countries that send the most children to adoptive homes in the @entity24			1
fear of fraud stirs heartache for @entity4 , the review seems more detrimental than helpful			0
her adopted daughter , @entity95 , remains in a @entity10 foster home with three dozen other babies			1
@entity4 worries that keeping @entity95 , now 15 months old , in a foster home will harm her early development			0
" she 's not getting one - on - one care by a consistent caretaker , " @entity4 said , adding later , " nobody is looking at this as a violation of the kids ' human rights except for these ( @entity24 ) parents			1
" @entity10 , which until now has had little to no oversight of its foreign adoptions , has the highest per capita rate of adoption in the world			2
nearly one in 100 babies born in @entity10 wind up living with adoptive parents in the @entity24 , according to the @entity24 consulate in @entity10			1
while adoptive parents in the @entity24 undergo rigorous screening , adoptions in @entity10 had been processed by notaries responsible for determining whether the babies were relinquished voluntarily			1
they also arrange foster care and handle paperwork -- notaries in @entity123 tend to have more legal training than notaries in the @entity24			0
both @entity10 and @entity24 officials fear the system leads to practices such as paying birth mothers for children or , in some instances , coercion			1
officials in both countries say gaps in regulations and the high sums of money at play -- adoptions can cost up to $ 30,000 -- may have created unintended incentives in a country where the @entity73 estimates that 80 percent of the population lives in poverty			0
the @entity10 government has said its review could take a month or longer			0
as for the @entity24 families , they can only wait			0
" i think it 's overkill , " said @entity4 , who was matched with @entity95 last march and was approved to adopt the girl last winter -- typically one of the last steps before the actual adoption is complete			0
" no adoptive parent wants to adopt an abducted child -- a child that was n't voluntarily relinquished -- but to keep them as hostages is unacceptable , " @entity4 said			0
@entity10 plans reforms @entity24 officials say they sympathize with the parents , but that reviews like the one in @entity10 are in the best interest of the children			1
" we feel for them , it 's a tough situation , " said a @entity73 official who is not authorized to speak on the record			0
" ( but ) they 'll have the comfort of knowing @entity24 parents in the future who adopt from @entity10 will get children from a system that has all the safeguards in place so that children are not exploited , " the official said			1
in the past , @entity10 required birth mothers to sign a document in court saying they were relinquishing their child			0
they were not required to reveal their reasons			0
now the government may require the presence of the birth mother and child			0
the goal is to verify identification and make sure the mother is giving up her child voluntarily			0
cleaning up @entity10 's adoption system is a step toward complying with the standards of the @entity196 on intercountry adoption , an international agreement that governs adoptions from one country to another			1
about 70 nations have signed the convention , which seeks to ensure legitimate foreign adoptions			0
the @entity24 joined the international convention last year , and rules governing adoptions from one signatory nation to another took effect april 1			0
the @entity24 has stopped issuing visas to @entity10 children after that date , blocking their travel to @entity123 -- at least until concerns are addressed			1
" we 're not pointing fingers at @entity24 parents , " the @entity73 official said			1
however , the review and changes in @entity10 will ensure that it " does not become a fertile ground for ( wrongful ) practices on any person , particularly children , who have not been orphaned			2
" to offset corruption , the @entity24 @entity225 has added its own requirement : that birth mothers appear with the baby to request a visa for the baby			1
in august , officials also began requiring two dna tests to confirm the identities of mother and child			0
still , the @entity10 solicitor general 's office has identified at least 80 cases of adoption irregularities , including baby stealing and false dna tests			1
and the @entity10 chief prosecutor 's office recently launched a criminal investigation into the two laboratories contracted to take dna samples from birth mothers and children			1
' serious irregularities ' in @entity20 similar concerns of corruption recently emerged in @entity20 , where investigators had found " serious adoption irregularities , " according to a report by the @entity225 in @entity256			1
documents had been forged or altered , the embassy said , and some parents were paid , tricked or forced into giving up their children for adoption			2
in some cases , the embassy said , children were offered for adoption without the knowledge or permission of their parents			2
the @entity20 government has denied the accusations			0
even so , it said in april that it would terminate its adoption agreement with the @entity24 , saying it wo n't accept applications after july 1			2
the program is scheduled to end september 1			0
parents in the @entity24 who were matched with an adoptive child in @entity20 before july 1 will be allowed to adopt that child			1
prospective parents who had invested time and money , but had not been matched with an adoptive child , appear to be out of luck			0
private adoption agencies insist that nearly all adoptions from @entity20 are problem - free , and they want the adoptions to continue			1
" it 's hard to let go , because we know we can advocate for these children and make a real difference , " said @entity286 , executive director of the @entity287 of @entity6 , which places children for adoption from @entity77 , @entity76 , @entity290 and @entity20			1
she hopes the @entity24 and @entity20 reach an agreement so that adoptions can continue			2
" without it , i think children are going to be harmed			0
they are going to die needlessly , and there is going to be trafficking , " @entity286 said .			0

@entity10 and @entity20 say corruption , baby - stealing at heart of crackdown
nearly one in 100 babies born in @entity10 are adopted by @entity24 parents
