-- pro-military hawks must be pleased with president @entity3 's speech on wednesday night about attacking @entity4			1
we 're sure to hear many of them -- the same voices that have been hounding the president to take military action in the first place -- call for more extensive strikes and even @entity13 troops on the ground			1
what we wo n't hear enough of are the voices of the opposition -- those who argue that military action will not get rid of @entity4 but make the situation worse in @entity21 and @entity22			1
there are strong reasons why many analysts think fighting @entity4 is the wrong course of action , and that there are more effective alternatives			1
for one thing , the @entity13 can pursue diplomatic and political solutions instead			2
military action against @entity4 is a bad idea because : 1			1
@entity13 intervention is what destabilized @entity21 in the first place -- and more bombing will likely make @entity21 less stable			1
our invasion of @entity21 and the installation of @entity41 as prime minister reignited deep sectarian tensions and created a power vacuum into which @entity4 stepped			1
you ca n't save a country by destroying it			0
a bombing campaign that is perceived as taking the side of @entity50 while undoubtedly decimating communities and killing civilians will only worsen @entity21 's instability			1
airstrikes wo n't destroy radical ideology , they 'll make it worse			1
most would - be terrorists do n't wake up one morning and suddenly decide to hate @entity13			0
often , there 's a reason			0
in 2006 , the classified @entity60 found that the 2003 @entity13 invasion and occupation of @entity21 helped create a new generation of terrorists and increased the overall terrorism threat against @entity13			2
more @entity13 military action in the @entity67 will just inflame more anti-american terrorists -- which perversely only strengthens the ideology that fuels @entity4 and other terrorist groups			1
there is no direct threat to the @entity13			0
when we see @entity76 refugees being slaughtered and @entity13 journalists being beheaded , of course our humanity calls for action			0
but those beating the drums of war have made assertions that @entity4 poses a direct threat to @entity13 soil			2
this is simply not true			0
even while playing up potential future threats to the homeland to justify military actions -- thus essentially embracing president @entity92 's pre-emption doctrine -- the @entity3 administration reports @entity4 currently poses no threat to the @entity13			1
if bombing is n't the solution , what is ? the solution to destroying @entity4 -- and mitigating @entity21 's problems in general -- is n't military but political			1
here are some key steps , according to analysts like @entity102 and advocates like @entity104 : 1			0
cut access to guns and money			0
it should be noted that @entity4 has access to weapons because @entity13 and @entity112 weapons have been flooding the region for over a decade			2
the @entity13 can take steps to shut down the weapons supply routes that @entity4 is relying on			2
this is the opposite of what @entity3 has outlined as a strategy in @entity22 and @entity21			1
the @entity13 also needs to re-evaluate its broader arms policy			0
in addition , part of @entity4 ' strength is due to its robust financial resources , a significant part of which relies on black market sales of oil now under @entity4 control			2
the @entity13 and allies can take clear steps , some of which @entity3 has proposed , to block the processing and sale of this oil			0
fix @entity21 's political rifts			0
while @entity4 allegedly has 20,000 fighters , there are 25 million @entity138 across the @entity67 , and as long as they remain disillusioned with @entity21 and @entity22 political leaders , they 're a potential recruiting ground for @entity4 to expand			1
this political crisis needs a political solution			0
encouraging @entity143 to step down and supporting a new , more inclusive @entity21 government is an important first step			0
the @entity13 , along with allies , must help heal the sectarian rifts			0
and yes , that means serious engagement with @entity150 -- a traditional @entity13 enemy which nonetheless shares our goal in stabilizing @entity21 and has far more diplomatic influence in the region than we do			2
while airstrikes wo n't help the @entity22 and @entity21 people , humanitarian assistance will			1
millions have been displaced and have become refugees			0
it would be nice if @entity13 politicians cheering on expensive and deadly bombing campaigns would be at least as enthusiastic , if not more so , about spending money on food and water and shelter for those in desperate need			0
the @entity3 administration recently announced an additional $ 48 million in such aid -- but that number is nothing compared with how much will be wasted in airstrikes			0
lead a truly international response			0
we do n't need a coalition of the willing or a coalition of the killing			0
we need a coalition of nations that will help put @entity21 on firm political and cultural footing and restart real negotiations in @entity22 involving all parties in the crisis there			1
the @entity13 should work through the @entity188 and seek diplomatic solutions through a broad coalition of nations			2
@entity3 's critics want him to act tough in the face of @entity4			2
but if acting tough by bombing @entity4 does n't solve the problem -- and makes the threat worse -- then acting tough is stupid			1
diplomacy may not have the same sexy veneer as aggressive military action , but if diplomacy could actually help the @entity22 and @entity21 people and make the world safer , is n't that what counts ?			1

@entity205 : pro-military hawks are pleased that president @entity3 plans to attack @entity4
@entity205 : military action will not get rid of @entity4 but make the situation worse in @entity21 , @entity22
she offers three reasons why striking @entity4 is a bad idea , and four strong diplomatic solutions
she says bombing @entity4 will worsen instability in @entity21 and fuel radical ideology more
