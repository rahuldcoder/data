-- @entity1 laughs when asked whether she 's seen the cover of this year 's @entity4 swimsuit issue			1
" you have to understand , where i live , we do n't get stuff , " she said with a chuckle recently			0
@entity1 , born in @entity10 and raised in @entity11 and @entity12 , now lives in the rural hamlet of @entity14 , @entity15 , near the @entity16			1
you would think that seeing the next iconic cover would appeal to @entity1			1
in 1964 , on that very first swimsuit cover , @entity1 was the star of the show			1
it was n't a big deal to her then			0
" it was just another job , " she said			2
" i never expected it to be big			0
it just did n't even enter my mind			0
it was really no big deal for me			0
i was just working , trying to survive in @entity27			1
" @entity1 was doing more than just surviving			1
she had been featured in the @entity29 collections and on the cover of @entity31 and other fashion magazines			2
she was one of the top - paid models in the world			2
@entity1 , whose last name was march then , said she looked at the swimsuit shoot as a 10 - day expenses - paid vacation to @entity39			1
the pay was n't memorable			0
@entity1 thinks it was about $ 100 a day			1
she basically went for the trip -- which was wild			2
@entity1 and another @entity10 model stayed with the crew in @entity45 , which in the early 1960s was relatively undeveloped			1
it was home to some fishermen , but in ' 61 , famous ocean explorer @entity49 declared it one of the best diving spots in the world , and it gradually became more of a tourist destination			0
@entity1 remembers staying in what could be described as a less - than - five - star hotel , flying to shoots in the morning and then partying late with members of the @entity39 air force			1
she described photographer @entity60 , whom she had worked with before , and the editors as " great			0
" she never really cared whether she got the cover			2
through the lens of 2011 , it 's an innocent cover			2
@entity1 stands in the clear water in a white bikini , as if she 's emerging from a dip in the surf			1
kind of " wholesome " - looking , @entity1 says now			1
she had no idea what it would lead to for the magazine			0
back then , it was n't even called the swimsuit issue			2
it was just five pages of a 17 - page spread on diving and popular winter resorts , mostly travel stories			0
@entity1 did n't even get her name on the front			1
over the years , the @entity4 swimsuit cover reveal has become one of the biggest moments of the year for the magazine , which is owned by @entity0 's parent company , @entity86			1
the issue sells more than a million copies , and according to the @entity92 , about 10 percent of the magazine 's revenue comes from that one issue			0
the issue boosts business for the companies that make the swimsuits and jewelry featured inside			0
and these days , the cover model gets a huge boost to her career			1
it was n't like that in 1964			0
@entity4 never told @entity1 that she was on the cover			1
" i found out through my agent , " she said			0
in fact , she did n't even have her own copy of the famous issue until just a few years ago , when a man sent her a few copies to autograph			0
she called him and said she 'd sign it if he let her keep one			0
she still gets lots of mail from across the country -- all from guys , she says -- asking for her autograph			0
the continuing interest intrigues her			0
@entity1 , who turns 70 this year , is an artist now			1
after her retirement in 1976 , she tried several things , including being a chef			0
in 1992 , she and her husband took a trip west , fell for @entity14 and moved into an abandoned church			2
@entity1 runs an art gallery ( she paints ) and hikes every day , even through the snow			1
she loves living in @entity14 with 349 other people			2
it 's gorgeous , she says			0
kind of like the woman on the cover of the january 20 , 1964 , issue of @entity4 , a photo that launched an institution .			1

@entity1 was on the january 20 , 1964 , cover of @entity4
@entity1 , a @entity27 - based model , says the first swimsuit shoot was just another job
she *fondly* remembers her shoot as a wild time *hanging* out with the @entity39 air force
