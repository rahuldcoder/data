researchers may be getting closer to an effective way of preventing age - related macular degeneration , one of the leading causes of vision loss among older @entity6			1
a new study found that vitamins @entity8 , @entity10 and folic acid may help prevent age - related macular degeneration			1
a new study finds that women who took a combination of @entity8 and @entity10 vitamins along with a folic acid supplement had lower risks of developing age - related macular degeneration			1
the women who got the supplements , compared with those taking a placebo , had a 34 percent lower risk of developing any form of @entity24 , and a 41 percent lower risk of more severe forms of @entity24			1
epidemiologist and study author @entity27 , @entity29 , of @entity30 and @entity31 , expects that if these findings are successfully replicated in future studies , " the combination of these vitamins might become the first prevention method of early stages of age - related macular degeneration other than avoiding cigarette smoking			1
" @entity39 also noted that although the study was conducted among women age 40 and older , there is no particular reason to believe the same results would not hold true in a similar group of men			0
@entity39 and his colleagues examined the role of vitamins @entity8 and @entity10 and folic acid in @entity24 partly because previous studies have shown these vitamins are known to lower levels of homocysteine , an amino acid found in the blood that when elevated has been associated with higher risks of @entity24			2
the 5,442 women who participated in the randomized , double - blind clinical trial already had heart disease or at least three risk factors for cardiovascular disease			0
the majority of them did not have @entity24 at the start of the study , which lasted more than 7 years			0
@entity39 explains that the underlying mechanism of @entity24 likely involves the vascular system , and researchers widely believe that cardiovascular disease and @entity24 share common risk factors			0
age - related macular degeneration is a vision disease common among people older than 60 , involving the deterioration of tissues in the macula , the central part of the retina			1
the condition impedes the performance of critical everyday functions such as reading and driving because it affects the ability to see items that a person is looking at directly , as opposed to items even a few degrees off to either side of the direct line of vision			0
" if you affect that central part of your vision , no one goes blind from it but it really interferes with your quality of life , " explains dr. @entity91 , ophthalmologist and spokesperson for the @entity93			0
there are two types of macular degeneration : wet and dry			2
wet forms of @entity24 are caused by abnormal blood vessels growing beneath the macula , which can rupture and bleed			0
the dry form is generally caused by cells in the macula degenerating over time and thus losing function			0
while some treatments do exist for the wet form of the disease ( including laser surgery , photodynamic therapy and injections into the eye ) , there is currently not much in the way of treatments for the more common dry form			0
when asked if the study results mean that people at high risk for @entity24 should begin taking a vitamin supplement that provides vitamins @entity8 , @entity10 and folic acid , retina specialist dr. @entity123 of the @entity93 suggests probably not yet			1
" if you do anything , i would take a supplement of antioxidant vitamins containing high doses of vitamins a , @entity138 , @entity139 and zinc , " suggests @entity123 , who has no financial interest in the vitamin supplement industry			2
these antioxidant vitamins were found to prevent the progression of age - related macular degeneration in the 10 - year @entity143 conducted by the @entity144 of the @entity145			1
however , @entity123 does say that while it still remains to be seen whether people currently taking a multivitamin containing the b vitamins and folic acid will be able to prevent early @entity24 from developing -- answers which will probably not be found for several years , after a large - scale clinical trial is begun -- there is little risk for most people in taking a daily multivitamin .			2

study : b vitamins may help prevent age - related macular degeneration
women taking @entity8 , @entity10 , folic acid had 34 percent lower risk of getting @entity24
study findings need to be replicated
only prevention now is avoiding smoking ; antioxidant vitamins prevent progression
