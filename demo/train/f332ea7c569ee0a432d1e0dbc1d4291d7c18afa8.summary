@entity0 , @entity1 -- a preliminary investigation has found no evidence of an " uncontained engine failure " or a " pre-impact fire " in the engine of a @entity11 cargo plane that crashed in @entity0 , @entity1 , killing the pilot and co-pilot , a @entity4 official said thursday			1
there also was no indication of a problem with runway lights , @entity14 of the @entity4 told reporters			1
the news came as authorities announced the cockpit voice and flight data recorders were recovered from the wreckage near @entity26 , and were being sent to @entity4 headquarters in @entity28			1
" we are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to collect good , usable data , " @entity14 said			2
the recorders were blackened and coated with soot from the fire that engulfed the plane on impact			1
but they are made to withstand crashes and heat , @entity14 said			0
investigators had to use picks and shovels to retrieve the data recorders from the wreckage because flames in the plane 's tail section kept officials from accessing them immediately			1
the devices could help investigators determine why the plane -- which did not issue a distress call -- went down early wednesday while on approach to the airport			1
@entity11 identified the pilots as capt. @entity53 , 58 , of @entity54 , @entity55 , and first officer @entity56 , 37 , of @entity57 , @entity58			1
@entity53 had been with @entity11 since 1990 and previously had served six years in the @entity59 as a heavy lift helicopter pilot , according to a statement released by @entity11			1
@entity56 had worked for @entity11 since 2006 , the statement said			1
the @entity62 broke into pieces as it crashed around 4:45 a.m. in an open field near a street that runs parallel to the airport			0
the cargo plane had 12 " service difficulty " reports on file at the @entity70 , including at least two that the reports indicated led pilots to declare emergencies			2
but an aviation expert told @entity2 he believes none of the previous problems would have played a role in the accident			0
the reports document problems ranging from an inoperative light in an emergency exit light assembly to a problem with the plane 's flaps			0
" i do n't see anything there that indicates in any way that its related to the events in @entity0 , " said @entity90 , a former @entity4 member and former certified aircraft mechanic			1
the flap problem , reported in 2006 while the plane was flying in @entity97 , might raise concern had it not occurred so long ago , he said			0
witnesses said the plane , which took off from @entity101 , @entity102 , flew low over a neighborhood , striking the tops of trees and knocking down power lines as it crashed			0
the crash site is about a half mile north of a runway			0
five facts to calm plane crash fears a photo showing the jet engine blades only partially damaged could indicate that the engines were not running or were at " very low idle " upon impact , instead of the faster " flight idle " typical upon landing , @entity90 said			1
" an engine that is producing power , those ( blades ) would have been gone , " said @entity90			2
the lack of damage suggests that " they were n't spinning so fast and they stopped quickly			2
" if the data recorders contain information , investigators should be able to quickly discover the status of the engines before impact			1
but if the data is not retrievable , investigators will focus on the condition of the blades , @entity90 predicted			2
@entity135 said wednesday the plane had approximately 11,000 flight hours in some 6,800 flights			0
it was powered by @entity141 engines			0
the plane was one of two flights @entity11 sends to @entity0 each day , company spokesman @entity142 told @entity2 affiliate @entity146			2
the crew did not report any trouble , @entity0 mayor @entity147 said , citing conversations with control tower officials			0
light showers and a visibility of 10 miles were reported in the area of the airport at the time of the crash , according to @entity2 meteorologist @entity158			0
@entity2 's @entity160 @entity159 , @entity161 , @entity162 , @entity163 and @entity164 contributed to this report			0
