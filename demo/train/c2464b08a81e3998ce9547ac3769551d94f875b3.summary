-- @entity1 is ready to host the @entity2 for the first time despite " prejudice " against its capabilities , claims the continent 's top soccer official			1
@entity8 , who has been president of the @entity9 since 1987 , told @entity0 that several @entity11 countries could stage the four - yearly competition			1
@entity1 has already successfully hosted the @entity13 in 2010 , the first @entity11 nation to do so , and @entity8 believes it can put on the other contender for the title of the planet 's biggest sporting event			1
" @entity1 can definitely organize the @entity2 , with its infrastructure , hotels , communications , transport , " he said saturday			1
" i do n't know if there are 10 countries in @entity25 that can be better than @entity1 in that respect			2
" but there are other countries in @entity1 that can organize an @entity2 like @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 -- i could also include @entity32			1
all those countries could organize it , but there 's a prejudice -- they say , ' oh , it 's @entity1 , they ca n't organize it			2
' " the 66 - year - old believes @entity1 has done a good job of hosting this month 's @entity41 football tournament despite some small crowds and substandard playing surfaces			1
" the challenge was to have a successful @entity41 because some people thought we could n't succeed because @entity1 is n't at the top of the sport at the moment , " said the @entity44 , a member of the @entity46 and also a @entity13 vice-president			1
" but the organizing committee showed a lot of effort and did everything to ensure that this competition would go well			0
of course , all the stadiums are not full , unlike what happened at the @entity13 but for an @entity41 i think we 've had a record attendance level			1
" we have sold just over 750,000 tickets which is a very good result			1
" however , @entity11 football journalist @entity66 told @entity0 that the tournament has been slightly disappointing despite some of the top players on show			1
" they had set an amount of 500,000 tickets to be sold for the tournament , but i still think it 's not enough , " said @entity66 , a correspondent for the broadcaster @entity72			1
" look at a game like @entity32 - @entity79 in the quarterfinals , one that you would have thought would be a sellout -- but it was n't			2
it shows there is a lot of work for @entity9 to do to fill stadiums for such a tournament			0
" sunday 's title match in @entity92 will be between two - time champions @entity32 and first - time finalists @entity95			2
" it 's a competition that 's created a lot of surprises , " @entity8 said			2
" if i 'm honest @entity32 is a big football team but @entity95 never reached that level before			1
" so although it 's a surprise it 's a good surprise because @entity32 and @entity95 have produced a good quality of football and that 's been satisfying to see			1
if they show us in the final what we saw in the quarterfinals and the semifinals it will be a very beautiful final that the whole world will enjoy			0
" @entity66 said @entity32 's " @entity32 " had done well to reach their first final since losing on home soil in 2000 , with coach @entity115 leaving out several big - name @entity25 - based players for the tournament			2
" i do n't think many people would have predicted that the @entity32 would get to the final , " he said			2
" to have reached this stage has been a big surprise but they 've got a lot of great players who have played very well			0
not a lot of people gave them a chance of beating the @entity79			0
" @entity115 is waiting until the last minute to decide on the fitness of four - goal @entity130 and @entity132 , who has netted twice in the tournament , after the key forward duo suffered injuries in the semifinal win over @entity137			0
the @entity95 have been boosted by the rescinding of @entity139 's sending - off against @entity140 , with officials admitting he should not have received a second booking			0
at the beginning of the tournament it was @entity146 being the fairytale story but now it 's moved to @entity95 , " @entity66 said			0
" they 've done well to reach this point			0
i think with @entity139 coming back to play the final after getting that red card it 's going to be a big motivation for them to go out and pull off a big upset			0
" meanwhile , @entity137 claimed third place for the second year in a row after beating @entity140 3 - 1 in a rematch of the 2012 playoff			0
@entity137 led 2 - 0 through a diving header by @entity160 and @entity162 's third goal of the tournament , but @entity140 's @entity164 missed the chance to net his fifth when he blazed a 58th - minute penalty over the bar in the pouring rain at @entity170 in @entity171			0
the @entity140 , who won the last of their four @entity11 titles in 1982 , got back into the game in the 82nd minute when @entity137 goalkeeper @entity175 was completely wrongfooted by a speculative long - range shot by @entity177			0
however , substitute @entity178 settled the match in time added on to give some cheer to a country embroiled in conflict between @entity185 rebel forces , government troops and the @entity188 military .			0

@entity8 says @entity1 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 could all be successful
he believes @entity1 has done well hosting @entity41 this month
