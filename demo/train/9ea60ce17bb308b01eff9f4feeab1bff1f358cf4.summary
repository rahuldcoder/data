-- in his speech about @entity3 tuesday night , president @entity1 tried to make a graceful turn on a fast - moving platform			1
he wanted to explain to a skeptical public why they should support his plan for a limited military attack on @entity3 in response to , the administration says , the use of chemical weapons by the @entity3 president @entity13			1
but his effort was only mildly successful , restating arguments that will be familiar even to those who have not been paying close attention , but also shining a spotlight on the weaknesses of the administration 's case			1
in the 36 hours leading up to his speech , the circumstances that would determine that case took several confusing turns			0
suddenly , with @entity3 's expressed willingness to give up its chemical weapons , a possible diplomatic avenue opened up that might allow the president to claim victory without launching a single missile			1
but this plan is far from a sure bet and brings problems of its own			0
this made the president 's job of persuasion even more difficult			0
the credible threat of force likely opened the tentative diplomatic path , which was opened accidentally when secretary of state @entity46 made an off - hand suggestion , " a major goof " in the words of a @entity51 official , when he said @entity13 could avoid @entity51 military action if he turned over chemical weapons in a week			1
" it ca n't be done , obviously , " he added , showing this was not a serious proposal			0
but the @entity57 and the @entity3 grabbed on to it and suddenly the picture changed dramatically			2
@entity1 still had a speech to make			1
the remarks were scheduled for the eve of a congressional vote on the president 's pla , a vote in which @entity1 's chances did not look good			1
he asked @entity69 to hold off on the vote			0
still , when he spoke to the people , for most of the address it sounded as if no diplomatic proposal had emerged			0
he waited until the last part of his remarks to start discussing the possible diplomatic breakthrough , which was a smart move			0
that entire episode shows the chaos that has reigned as the administration tried to make its case for a military response with strict , self - imposed restrictions			0
( @entity1 had to at least appear to have some control of the situation			1
) he was correct to use this time with the @entity51 people instead to try to explain to them ( and the rest of the world ) why the use of chemical weapons in @entity3 is a threat to everyone , not just the @entity3 people			1
and he was right to try to bolster support for @entity51 intervention			0
the threat is the only thing that can move a ruthless dictator , because in the end , it is very possible that the plan to dismantle @entity3 chemical weapons could fall apart			1
the task is enormously difficult , dangerous and expensive			0
experts say it could take years under the best of circumstances to get rid of what is one of the world 's biggest stockpiles			0
doing it in the middle of a civil war could , in fact , prove impossible			0
@entity1 knows that @entity57 and @entity3 , whose paramount goal is the survival of the @entity13 regime , may be playing for time			1
@entity13 has watched @entity121 game the international community with years of inspections and negotiations without stopping its own program of banned weapons			2
the president once again appealed to our shared humanity as well as national security and international stability			0
he urged @entity51 to look at the wrenching videos showing rows and rows of dead children wrapped in white shrouds , among the more than 1,400 victims of the aug. 21 gas attack			0
the arguments are valid , but there 's much in the administration 's logic that is deeply disturbing			0
the @entity3 conflict is -- we must always remember this -- a moral issue , a matter of profound human suffering			2
when the president describes the brutality of the @entity13 regime but then goes on to say the regime can stay in power , its claim to the moral high ground is weak			2
when @entity1 speaks of the devastating images of innocent children dying before their helpless parents , and when he says " when dictators commit atrocities they rely on the world to look the other way , " it is disingenuous to say we must not look the other way when chemical weapons are used , but killing by conventional means is really not our problem			1
like everything else about the @entity3 conflict , the @entity57 proposal is far from the ideal option			2
it legitimizes @entity13 's rule , it betrays the hopes of the @entity3 opposition and it fails to punish the regime for war crimes			1
it may leave @entity51 with all sides in @entity3 feeling angry and betrayed , as in @entity179			2
it strengthens @entity13 and @entity180			2
that said , if it removes @entity3 's chemical weapons , it will in fact protect the " red line " @entity1 had set , showing that chemical weapons use triggers international consequences			1
the president and his secretary of state have been making the case that @entity13 's capabilities must be degraded , that the more moderate among the rebels need @entity194 support , that failure to help them will make the extremists in the opposition attract more support			2
the diplomatic proposal saved @entity1 from the immediate threat of failure in @entity69 and may just keep him out of the conflict			1
the president 's ambivalence about entering has been palpable			0
he is probably relieved about an opportunity to move in a different direction			0
so far , @entity1 's march to non-war in @entity3 has been marked by failures of persuasion and of process			1
whatever happens next , there is no question that the suffering of the @entity3 people will not end any time soon and that @entity3 will continue to be a daunting problem for president @entity1			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			0

@entity224 : @entity1 went into speech with @entity3 situation in new flux ; was mildly successful
she says he saved talk of diplomatic plan till after he described gassing of kids
she says this because clearing @entity3 's chemical weapons could fall through , as @entity13 buys time
@entity238 : if diplomacy restores " red line , " @entity1 's threat will show threat of consequences matters
