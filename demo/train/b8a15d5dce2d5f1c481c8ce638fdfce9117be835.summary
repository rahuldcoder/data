jailed on charges of treason and sabotage -- but fundamentally for his anti-apartheid activities -- he spent nearly 27 years in various prisons			1
during that time , his mother and son died , and his wife , @entity12 ( now his ex-wife ) , faced continual arrests and harassment , according to his official biography			2

" today is the anniversary of the day when revolutionary leader @entity57 toppled the @entity59 - backed government of the shah , who fled @entity36			1
this key date in @entity36 's history comes amid protests by the opposition after last year 's disputed presidential election , won by incumbent @entity66			1
the so - called @entity67 has been protesting for social justice , freedom and democracy in demonstrations throughout the country since the june polls -- using slogans that are often identical to those heard during the 1979 @entity42 revolution			1
many of the recent demonstrations became violent and bloody			2
two leading @entity36 opposition leaders have called on supporters to protest today , the day of the anniversary			1
ayatollah @entity34 has been @entity36 's supreme leader for more than 20 years			1
as a young cleric , his political activism led to many arrests and torture by the shah 's secret police -- the same shah who was supported by the @entity59 and @entity90			1
@entity0 : @entity36 marks revolution anniversary amid ongoing dissent @entity93 : @entity36 's supreme leader @entity94 : the 22 - year - old senior at @entity96 in @entity97 was detained at an airport last august , handcuffed and then jailed for several hours in a holding cell			1
@entity94 passed through a screening checkpoint at the @entity101 , @entity102 , airport with a set of @entity106 - @entity105 flashcards and a book critical of @entity59 foreign policy			0
also , @entity94 's passport had been stamped in @entity110 , where he had studied for a semester , and in @entity111 and @entity112 , where he 'd gone backpacking			1
a @entity114 supervisor arrived and allegedly questioned @entity94 aggressively , asking him how he felt about 9/11 , whether he knew " who did 9/11 , " and whether he knew what language @entity115 spoke			0
in a lawsuit filed wednesday , the @entity118 and the @entity118 of @entity102 charge that the @entity114 officials , the @entity101 police and the @entity122 violated @entity94 's @entity124 right to be free from unreasonable seizure and his @entity126 right to free speech			1
@entity94 told @entity0 he no longer flies with his flashcards and reading material			0
he said he 's learning @entity106 in hopes of one day helping the @entity59 government			1
in september , @entity132 in the @entity133 reported that among the 200 flashcards were words like " terrorist " and " explosion			0
" @entity94 told the newspaper last year , " i did n't have a weapon or anything seditious , just words on paper			2
as an @entity59 citizen , i think i 'm allowed to learn a foreign language and have flashcards			0
" @entity133 : student traveler handcuffed @entity118 : @entity94 v. @entity147 for damages @entity0 : passenger detained with @entity106 flashcards sues @entity151 : on january 12 , from his room at the @entity154 near @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity59 @entity152 maj. @entity151 sent an e-mail to his wife , @entity158 , telling her that he was fine and had just settled in for what was going to be an exciting time taking a disaster preparedness course			0
it was 4:51 p.m. less than 10 minutes later , an earthquake leveled much of the @entity156 capital , including the @entity154			0
@entity167 , at home in @entity166 , saw the news on tv , popped her laptop open and fired off an e-mail : " please tell me you 're ok			0
yesterday , @entity0 received a copy of a message from @entity152 gen. @entity176 to his troops , announcing that @entity151 's body was found on monday in the rubble of the @entity154			2
he reported that @entity151 's remains were transferred to @entity181 , @entity182 , and met by his wife , family members and fellow service members			2
gen. @entity176 wrote , " many of you knew @entity151 through his outstanding work as a @entity190			0
all of us who worked with @entity151 regarded him as the consummate @entity152 professional , who could always be counted upon for the toughest assignment , as well as a caring teammate who went out of his way to help others and build cohesion amongst his peers			0
" the @entity200 had two sons and a stepson and their fifth wedding anniversary would have been in march			2
@entity0 : e-mail from @entity156 , then minutes later , a nightmare @entity206 : the 23 - year - old @entity207 , @entity97 , cocktail waitress , whose post-thanksgiving voice mail to @entity210 helped lead to the unraveling of the golf great 's pristine public image , gave an exclusive interview to @entity207 tv station @entity215			1
she did not deny that her relationship with @entity210 lasted for nearly three years			1
she explained that after the car crash incident outside of @entity210 ' home , she left him a voice mail out of concern , but did n't " think it through " when she released it to @entity222			1
she said all of the subsequent attention has been tough			0
" i do n't like to show my emotions			2
i just do it when nobody 's around , so my friends all think i 'm solid rock , a strong person			2
but there are times when i get up in the morning , get in the shower , then sit there on the shower floor and cry for 30 minutes			0
" @entity215 : @entity206 sets the record straight what makes a person intriguing ? there are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new , important or different			1
others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect			0
and there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news			0
some of these people do what we expect of them : they run for office , pass legislation , start a business , get hired or fired , commit a crime , make an arrest , get in accidents , hit a home run , overthrow a government , fight wars , sue an opponent , put out fires , prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses			0
they do make news , but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story			0
but every day , there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character , how they reached their decision , how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in			0
we hear about them and want to know more			0
what they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country			0
at times , there is even a mystery about them			0
what they have done may be unique , heroic , cowardly or ghastly , but they capture our imaginations			0
we want to know what makes them tick , why they believe what they do , and why they did what they did			0

20 years ago today , @entity1 was released from prison
@entity36 's supreme leader says a " punch " will be delivered during revolution anniversary
@entity206 says she did n't think through releasing @entity210 ' voice mail
