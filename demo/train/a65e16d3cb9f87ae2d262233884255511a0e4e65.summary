-- for all the headaches on the campaign trail , you would not think a candidate would be hounded by his own dog			2
that , however , has been the relentless fate of @entity8 contender @entity7			1
a trip to @entity10 30 years ago with the family pooch in a car top carrier , has been the gift that just keeps giving to @entity14			0
they 've lampooned him as cruel at worst , foolish at best , with bumper stickers and t - shirts that say " dogs are n't luggage ! " and " @entity7 is mean ! " @entity8 have counterattacked by pointing out that president @entity20 wrote in his own book about eating dog as a child , helping the dog fight become a theme at this year 's @entity27 dinner			1
comedian @entity28 nipped at both of them			0
" if @entity7 offers you a ride , call shotgun			1
and if president @entity20 starts buttering you , run ! " it would be easy to dismiss all of this as political silliness were it not for one troubling fact : sometimes the way a president connects with critters can affect the way voters relate to him			1
" presidents and their pets have a long and storied history , " says @entity45 , a goldfish owner and editor - in - chief at @entity48 magazine			1
his theory about why voters take such an interest in such matters : " most of us do n't ' get ' @entity58 oil politics , and the rise and fall of the @entity60 , but we can ' get ' if you connect with a dog or you connect with a cat			2
" first a little history			2
ever since @entity66 took office with horses and hounds in tow , presidents have welcomed animals into their lives			0
" @entity79 , " @entity45 says , " actually liked surprising guests with an alligator he kept hidden in a bathtub			1
" @entity80 , famous for his love of the great outdoors , brought a great deal of it indoors when he took the oath			1
in addition to dogs and horses , @entity80 had parrots , ponies , bears , a zebra , snakes , lizards , and for reasons lost to time , a one - legged chicken			1
@entity97 had a cow that which was photographed munching away on the @entity27 grounds			1
@entity100 followed suit with sheep			0
actually , he pioneered the public relations potential of the flock by using it to keep the grass trimmed during @entity107			2
old black and white film shows @entity100 gazing proudly out of his presidential office as the rams and ewes chew away at the yard , saving @entity113 a few mowing fees in a time of austerity			0
@entity117 may seem like the blandest chief executive ever in his photos , but apparently he was a wild man			1
like @entity80 , he brought a zoo with him : @entity122 cubs , a goose , a bobcat and a raccoon , among other critters			2
while in office , he was given a pygmy hippo by @entity129 of car tire fame			0
" both @entity80 and @entity117 gave large parts of their menageries to the @entity136 here in @entity138 , " @entity45 says , " and even today many if not most of the pygmy hippos here in the @entity141 are descendents of that @entity117 hippo			1
" now that 's a presidential legacy			2
dogs , however , have always been the most likely pick for first pet , for better or worse			0
for example , when @entity149 was in office , a story went around that he 'd accidentally left behind his @entity153 terrier , @entity154 , during a tour of the @entity156 , and then sent the @entity157 back to rescue the dog			1
critics howled over the supposed waste of taxpayer dollars			0
@entity149 , however , neatly mows them down on a scratchy old bit of film			0
" well , of course , i do n't resent attacks , " he said , his lantern jaw jutting over a cluster of clunky microphones , without a hint of smile			0
" my family do n't resent attacks			0
but @entity154 does resent attacks ! " his audience roared , the critics retreated , and @entity154 became so famous that the dog is even a feature of the @entity178 in @entity138 , sitting in bronze at the feet of the 32nd president			1
@entity182 pulled a similar trick back in 1952 when he was @entity184 's running mate			0
defending himself against accusations of receiving improper gifts , he listed his kids ' dog , @entity190 , as one of them			1
" and i just want to say right now , " @entity182 told a television audience , " that regardless of what they say about him , we 're going to keep him			0
" voters ate it up			0
@entity182 humanized himself in one sentence more than he would in an entire career			0
the " @entity190 " became a political legend			2
it does not always go well			0
@entity204 picked up one of his beagles by the ears , and heard dog lovers howl from coast to coast			1
in his classic @entity211 form , @entity204 eventually talked his way out of it , but not without a few scratches			2
still , one has to wonder , with all the potential for things to go wrong with a dog in the @entity27 , why do presidents almost always have one ? @entity45 has a theory on that , too : " the presidency is a very lonely undertaking , and i think there are many moments in the @entity27 where what you really want to do is take your pet for a walk			1

dog lovers and comedians are *sinking* their *canines* into tales of @entity7 and @entity20
the *dustups* are nothing new ; the @entity27 has a long history of animal occupants
@entity79 ' gator , @entity80 's and @entity117 's menageries were legendary , and @entity97 had a cow
from @entity154 to @entity190 to @entity204 's beagles , treatment of dogs has *resonated* with the public
