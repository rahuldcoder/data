@entity0 , @entity1 -- along with the city 's power and phone service , the hospital 's pager network went down when the tornado hit			1
but like nearly every doctor in @entity0 , orthopedic surgeon @entity9 did n't need his beeper to tell him to head to the trauma center			1
@entity9 said he did n't know what to expect when he arrived at @entity14 on wednesday			1
" the emergency room was just overflowing , " said @entity9 , 38			1
" i was just in shock when i walked in to see the sheer volume of injured people and the severity of the injuries			1
" patients filled the hallway and every available room			0
injuries ranged from minor cuts , lacerations and broken ankles to severe trauma from debris that sliced patients ' heads , chests and abdomens			2
the wounded screamed for help			2
others scrambled through the chaotic scene , searching for loved ones			2
pickups screeched into the emergency room driveway with injured loved ones helpless and bleeding in the truck beds			2
early on , the hospital relied on backup generator power			0
the fierce tornado clipped the back of the hospital			0
water and air conditioning were lost through most of the night			0
the trauma center turned into a triage unit , much like a war zone hospital			1
with systems down , doctors , nurses , x-ray technicians and other staff members went into overdrive			2
" in the midst of that , we 're trying to identify the worst of those injuries and try to get them dealt with as best we could , " @entity9 said			1
" it 's just impossible to adequately prepare yourself for that situation			0
but fortunately , after that initial shock wore off , people got down to work			1
" over the next six hours , more than 650 patients were treated at the facility			1
" that 's a staggering number , " he said			0
another 150 patients were treated at a sister hospital across town			2
at @entity79 , about eight orthopedic surgeons , another 50 to 75 doctors and surgeons , and dozens more staffers descended on the hospital			1
many came to work on that devastatingly historic night despite losing their own homes and cars , or even hearing that cousins and other relatives were missing , he said			1
" everybody showed up and got to work			0
it was amazing to see			0
" unfortunately , a number of the patients who did get here were n't able to be saved , and that 's tough to deal with , " @entity9 said			2
" one of the hardest things to deal with was seeing some of the parents carrying in children , babies , infants who had terrible injuries -- some of them clearly unlikely to survive			0
" just watching that unfold in front of you is something no one wants to see			0
" he said he 's amazed by the dedication of staff , not only here but from doctors across the region who offered their services			0
@entity9 , still dressed in scrubs saturday and having worked nearly every hour since the storm , held back tears			1
" it 's just an amazing , emotional roller coaster for these people , " he said			0
" once we were able to take a break from it and think about it , it was heartbreaking			0
