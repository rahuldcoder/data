-- it 's the $ 199 headband that will allow you to control things using your mind , the makers say			1
the @entity7 headband was unveiled this week at @entity8 and @entity0 caught up with founder of @entity10 for a demonstration of the brainwave - sensing headband			1
@entity10 says @entity7 works using the same technology used in hospitals known as @entity15 ( @entity15 ) , which records electrical activity along the scalp			1
@entity7 is embedded with four sensors that allows you to see and track your brain 's activity , in the same way a heart rate monitor gives information about your physical activity			1
you can also use your mind to control games and applications supplied with the headband , @entity10 says			1
" it interacts with content directly with your mind so you can play games that you are able to control with your mind , " says the @entity31 neuroscientist and entrepreneur			1
connecting to any device such as a smartphone , tablet or laptop via bluetooth , @entity7 can be worn on the go and includes a " brain fitness suite " app that tracks the state of your brain or can help you de-stress			1
she adds : " and as you play the games , you are working with and strengthening your mind			1
the most important thing is that it can help you improve your cognitive and emotional function , it shows you your brain activity and gives you targeted exercises to improve both cognitive and emotional functioning			2
" @entity7 will help with improving brain function , power and memory in the same way @entity58 and crosswords do presently , explains @entity10			1
" but they are doing that on an indirect level , we are moving it one scale up with @entity7 , " she says			2
@entity65 : discover all the action from @entity8 on @entity0 @entity10 first talked about the concept of thought - controlled computer technology at @entity8 two years ago			1
since then she has raised nearly double the $ 150,000 she sought on the @entity70 crowd - funding website			0
" research labs have been using this tech for years , now its time to bring all this understanding and improvements to the consumer , taking it from the labs to your inbox , " she says			0
" the most important part of ourselves is the mind and it has been rather inaccessible			0
this is a tool that helps unlock the mind in really exciting ways			0
people seem pretty excited , " she adds			0
" there has n't been a person i 've spoken to who has n't wanted one			0
" i confess to being excited too as i slipped on the lightweight and sleek - looking headband which rests on the forehead and tucks behind the ears , like a pair of glasses			0
@entity7 was connected to a laptop and felt comfortable as i got ready to try out a special demo application called @entity101 , a mood - based text editor that changes fonts depending on your brainwave activity			2
it felt strange watching my brain in real - time on the screen in front of me as @entity10 asked me to blink and showed me how the action impacted my brainwaves			2
more from @entity8 : cyborg anthropologist : we can all be superhuman then she asked me to type something			2
" i miss my daughter , " i wrote and was surprised to see the font suddenly change to a more flowery style as i typed out daughter			0
@entity120 explained that as i focused on what to type in the beginning , the text was clean and tight and as i became more open and relaxed the text appeared more flowery			0
when someone is smiling , the letters will suddenly appear very big , she explained			0
undoubtedly , @entity101 , though only a demo at present , has huge implications for new ways of communication in the real and virtual world in the future			0
developers will be excited at the possibility of creating applications that could perhaps be used to convey information through avatars			0
could it be the end of the exclamation mark ? @entity7 is available to buy on the @entity70 website until december 7 for early adopters and after that , will be available again in june 2013 , when they start shipping			1
are you excited about @entity7 ? will you be buying it ? let us know in the comments .			2
