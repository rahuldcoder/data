-- @entity1 had claimed it was a tougher ask to defend his @entity4 title than win it for a first time and so it proved , the @entity6 retiring after a third crash in the space of two days			2
@entity11 favourite to defend his tour title at saturday 's race start , @entity1 had crashed just four kilometers into tuesday 's stage damaging his left wrist and ripping skin off his left hip and buttock			1
tour doctor @entity19 declared him fit to race on , an x-ray showing no broken bones			0
but in torridly wet conditions during wednesday 's fifth stage , @entity1 crashed twice more after 29 and 85 kilometers , this time taking skin off the right - hand side of the body and forcing him to limp into his @entity28 car holding his wrist -- and out of the race			1
@entity1 's teammate @entity31 had warned of the treacherous conditions that lay ahead on the stage , much of which was on cobblestones , saying : " nobody is looking forward to it			1
" it 's like riding on ice , especially with some of the corners as well			0
it 'll be the last man standing			0
it 's going to be a nightmare			0
" nightmare it was for @entity28 as @entity1 crashed three kilometers before even the first of nine cobbled sections on the stage , which makes up much of the @entity49 classic , better known as " the @entity50 " , his team announcing his official retirement via @entity53			1
two sections of the cobblestones -- or pave -- were scrapped by race organizers because of the treacherous conditions , which @entity50 boss sir @entity57 described as " the wisest decision			0
" @entity1 's withdrawal is potentially awkward for @entity60 given he omitted 2012 @entity4 winner sir @entity61 from @entity28 because of the potential negative dynamic within the team due to his previously fractious relationship with @entity1			1
in good form and a former @entity4 winner , @entity64 would have been an obvious @entity67 but that task may now rest on the shoulders of @entity71 @entity70 , @entity1 's close friend and near neighbor in @entity73			1
@entity1 's abandonment is a major blow for race organizers of an event billed by many as a head - to - head between @entity1 and @entity81 's @entity80			2
wednesday 's stage was won by @entity84 rider @entity83 while race leader @entity85 extended his lead by finish just 19 seconds back in third			2
@entity85 now leads the race from @entity90 teammate @entity89 by two seconds .			0

@entity1 is forced to abandon on stage five of the tour after a third crash
the defending champion had already begun the day 's racing with a damaged wrist
teammate @entity31 had previously warned about the *dangers* in the torrid weather
it leads to question marks over @entity28 's *selection* after 2012 winner @entity64 was omitted
