-- the chief prosecutor at the @entity2 says he has evidence to prove @entity5 president @entity4 is guilty of genocide , even though he is not charged with the crime			1
@entity4 remains president and has traveled to several countries since warrant was issued			0
@entity10 spoke to @entity0 on wednesday , two days after he appealed to the court to add genocide to the existing arrest warrant for @entity4			1
the court issued the warrant in march on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity relating to his five - year campaign of violence in western @entity5 's @entity24 region			1
" the evidence shows it is genocide , " @entity10 said			2
the warrant was the first one ever issued for a sitting head of state by the world 's only permanent war crimes tribunal , based at @entity31 in the @entity32			1
it includes five counts of crimes against humanity , including murder , extermination , forcible transfer , torture and rape			0
it also includes two charges of war crimes for intentionally directing attacks against civilians and for pillaging			1
@entity4 remains president and has traveled to several countries since the warrant was issued , even though any country that is party to the @entity2 has an obligation to hand him over to @entity31 , the court says			0
the @entity54 estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in @entity24 , and 2.5 million have been forced to flee their homes			1
@entity5 denies the death toll is that high			0
the violence in @entity24 erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the @entity5 government			1
to counter the rebels , @entity5 authorities armed and cooperated with @entity70 militias that went from village to village in @entity24 , killing , torturing and raping residents there , according to the @entity54 , @entity66 governments and human rights organizations			1
the militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength			0
in his appeal to the court monday , @entity10 complained that the judges ' standard for adding the genocide charge to the warrant is too high			2
the judges want him to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that @entity4 committed genocide , but that level of proof is not required for a warrant , which only requires a reasonable inference of guilt , he said			2
" they are requesting a level of evidence that is the level of evidence required at the trial stage , not at the beginning of the process , " @entity10 said			0
part of the reason that prosecutors can not provide more evidence at this stage is because @entity4 is attacking witnesses who are willing to provide information to prosecutors , @entity10 said			2
presenting more evidence could endanger the victims , he said			0
" it 's a legal issue , " he said			0
" the judgment by itself is very important , but in addition i can not accept this wrong legal standard			0
" the judges believe the crimes that @entity10 classifies as genocide instead fall under the category of crimes against humanity , he said			1
even if @entity10 were successful in adding genocide to the warrant , he would still face a difficult task in proving the charges at trial , said @entity124 , the executive director of the @entity125			2
" genocide is a much more complicated legal position to meet ( than war crimes and crimes against humanity ) because you have to show in proving genocide that there was an intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a group based on -- in this case -- ethnicity or race , " @entity124 told @entity0			1
" obviously the prosecutor believes he would be able to prove this intent and so he wants the opportunity to prove that in trial			0
" but if @entity10 loses the appeal , @entity124 said , it would not minimize the seriousness of the case			0
" the charges that have been ( alleged ) on war crimes and crimes against humanity are still very serious charges and they are egregious acts , " he said			1
a ruling on the appeal is likely within six months , @entity10 told @entity0 .			0
