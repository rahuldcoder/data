-- replacing the internal organs of @entity3 -- the south @entity5 teen found dead in his high school gym a year ago -- with newspaper is not a " best practice " for any mortician , but it 's not illegal either , a state board wrote thursday			1
" legislation or regulation does not address the practice or prohibit funeral professionals from filling a cavity with newspaper , " the @entity10 said in a letter addressed to @entity3 's mother			1
" therefore , the practice ... is not a violation of the law			0
" this finding yielded few answers for @entity3 's family , including where his organs actually ended up			1
on that matter , the board said only that it could n't determine if " the organs were transferred to the funeral ( home ) with the body			2
" neither the funeral home nor @entity3 's family immediately responded thursday to @entity0 's request for comment on the state finding			1
the family did n't even know the late teen 's brain , heart , lungs , liver and other viscera were missing until the middle of last year , when an autopsy they 'd requested was conducted june 15 by dr. @entity45 with @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity48			1
this was actually a second autopsy on the three - sport athlete after he was found dead january 11 , 2013 , in a rolled - up gym mat inside @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity5			1
the @entity55 handled the first one , then ruled the death accidental			0
and the @entity59 , while not commenting on every twist and turn in the case , has repeatedly stood by its original determination that @entity3 died by accident after getting caught up reaching for his shoe			0
@entity0 examined the 522 - page police file and found that investigators spoke to 111 people , including 18 on the day @entity3 's body was found			1
" it was not a rash decision that was leapt to , " lt. @entity68 told @entity0 in may , the day after his investigators closed their case			0
" we 've drawn this out , done a thorough investigation , and we think we 've covered all bases			0
" but the disbelieving @entity3 family pushed in court , leading to a judge 's decision may 1 to grant their request to exhume their son 's body for an independent autopsy at their expense			1
@entity45 determined in that second autopsy that @entity3 suffered blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues , " consistent with inflicted injury , " seemingly defying the authorities ruling it was accidental			2
it 's what he did n't find -- the late teen 's internal organs -- that prompted his family to formally ask the state to investigate the handling of their son 's body			1
@entity0 was the first to report the development in october			0
that complaint alleged that @entity106 mishandled the body and specifically accuses director @entity108 of helping obscure the teen 's cause of death			2
specifically , it alleged that the @entity55 said it replaced all of the organs after its autopsy			0
@entity108 initially said " one or two organs might be missing , " according to the complaint			0
but in an october 4 letter to the family 's attorney , @entity119 , the funeral home director said the organs had been " destroyed " and " discarded ... before the body was sent back to @entity54 , " where the funeral home took custody of the body			2
however , the funeral home 's attorney , @entity127 , told @entity0 in october that coroner @entity129 has already called the " accusations and innuendo regarding mr. @entity108 's involvement in the disposition of young mr. @entity3 's internal organs ... baseless			2
" according to " the principles and @entity141 " -- a sentence of which was included in @entity127 's october letter to @entity0 -- when organs are removed in an autopsy , the person handling the body should dry the cavity , " dusting it with hardening compound or embalming powder and then filling it with dry , clean sawdust or cotton mixed with a small quantity of hardening compound or embalming powder			1
" @entity127 conceded at a november interview that newspaper is not listed as an option in this process , but he added , " nor is it precluded as one type of foreign substance that may be introduced into a body for purposes of building it up for public display			0
" in fact , the @entity10 said in its letter thursday that " filling a body cavity is a necessary preparation to present a deceased body for public viewing			0
" the state agency also added there are products available to do this " that are more acceptable than newspaper , " which it notes was relatively common in the past			0
" the @entity10 may consider appropriate regulations concerning this issue in the near future , " it wrote about the practice of filling a body cavity with newspaper			2
so what can the @entity3 family do now ? for starters , they can take solace in the fact that federal authorities are investigating their son 's death			1
to this point , the @entity193 seized the original hard drives from the @entity197 surveillance system last month , according to a source with knowledge of the investigation			0
and the @entity193 has been in @entity202 conducting interviews , including an almost three - hour sitdown with the @entity204 in the city of @entity206			0
and the state funeral board 's finding that funeral home staff did n't commit a crime , and its decision to close its case , does n't mean the family ca n't go after them in court			1
the state funeral board told them in its letter thursday : " you may wish to consult with your personal attorney or a court of appropriate jurisdiction to determine what civil remedies may be available to you			2

new : the state board says family " may wish to consult " a lawyer or court
filling body with newspaper not " best practice , " but not a crime , agency says
@entity3 was found in a rolled - up gym mat at school last year
