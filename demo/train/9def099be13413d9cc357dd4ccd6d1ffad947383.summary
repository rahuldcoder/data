-- researchers at the @entity3 at the @entity1 in southern @entity4 believe that 745 penguins found washed up along the state 's coastline since june 15 have died of natural causes			1
the center , known as @entity10 , said in a release this week that it reached the conclusion after analyzing the conditions in which the animals were found			0
most of the birds were young , according to biologist @entity18			1
the lean birds showed no signs of external injury or oil in their plumes			2
" birds in the first year of life are inexperienced , " he said , adding that the pattern of dead birds is common for this time of year and that the deaths are a result of " the process of natural selection			1
" in 2010 , more than 550 penguins washed up on @entity7 's @entity36 coast			1
in that case , necropsies showed that the penguins died of starvation			2
the @entity42 government launched an official inquiry this year when close to 3,000 dolphins and more than 500 pelicans washed up along that country 's northern @entity46			1
this case is the first in which @entity10 is conducting a more intensive monitoring of deaths			0
according to @entity18 , july is historically the month when more birds arrive at the center for rehabilitation after washing up on the beaches weakened , injured or covered in oil			2
" the animals usually migrate from @entity58 around this time of year in search of food and warmer weather , and each year , some do wash up , " he said			1
" but over 500 is a very , very high number			0
" @entity10 set up weekly monitoring along the @entity65 do @entity67 coast to study the dynamics of the @entity70 penguins			1
the biologists working at the center also collected 30 birds for a more detailed analysis ; that report should be completed within a month			1
the release says the physical state of the birds is such that researchers could designate the deaths natural			2
@entity18 said earlier that " the animals were a lot smaller in terms of size and weight than normal penguins , so we think it will be natural causes , but it is certainly very strange			0
" penguins have also shown up along the famous beaches of @entity93			0
@entity0 affiliate @entity94 reports that since the end of june , almost 40 penguins have been rescued along the beaches			0
in those cases , the birds are being cared for by @entity100 and the @entity101			0
