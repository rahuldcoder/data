@entity0 and @entity1 faced off again saturday , far from their volatile border region , on the glitzy stage of the @entity5			1
tensions between the neighbors gave an added piquancy to the competition 's grand final in @entity11 , @entity12 , in which both nations were fielding entries			1
@entity15 annexed @entity1 's @entity16 in march and eastern @entity1 is currently roiled by @entity18 separatist protests			1
on the night , however , it was a much talked about 25 - year - old from @entity21 who stole the show			1
@entity24 , the onstage drag persona of @entity24 , was the runaway winner for a performance of the ballad " @entity28			2
" @entity24 also refers to himself as " the bearded lady , " he says on his website			2
in his private life , he calls himself " @entity34 " and refers to himself as " he			0
" in the role of @entity24 , who @entity24 calls an " art figure , " the artist refers to " herself " as " she			2
" @entity24 created @entity40 -- which in @entity41 means sausage but can also mean ' who cares ? ' -- in his teen years to cope with feeling discriminated against			2
performing in a skintight dress with long hair and a full beard , @entity24 scored 290 points to become @entity21 's first @entity5 winner since 1966			1
" for me , my dream came true , " @entity24 told reporters after the contest			2
" but for society it showed me that people want to move on , to look to the future			0
we said something , we made a statement			0
" @entity24 's presence in the competition had proved controversial in some countries			1
in @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity0 -- where a law against " gay propaganda " was passed last year -- petitions were circulated calling for the singer to be removed from the competition or edited out of the broadcast			2
in @entity0 , @entity40 's win drew boos in some places where audiences had gathered to watch the contest			1
@entity24 's manager , @entity77 , described the win as a victory for tolerance , one of the main themes emphasized by the contest 's organizers			1
" let 's change the world and make it a little bit better , " @entity77 said			0
" @entity24 always says : ' wish for the moon and you 'll reach at least the stars , ' but now we just landed on the moon			2
let 's change our way of thinking -- @entity24 is just a woman with a beard			1
" non-political event ? created in the aftermath of @entity99 to encourage good relations between neighbors , @entity5 has been held every year since 1956 , and today draws a television audience of about 180 million people in 45 countries			0
contestants are often eccentric , colorful , unusual -- on the fringes of mainstream music in their home countries			0
the organizers describe the event -- known for its combination of over-the - top costumes , kitsch pop songs and sometimes questionable talent -- as non-political			0
but in reality , politics inevitably colors both the voting and the performances			0
this was demonstrated to an unusual degree tuesday , when @entity0 's entrants -- 17 - year - old twins @entity124 and @entity126 -- were booed by the audience during their semi-final performance			1
@entity129 , a @entity5 expert and the editor - in - chief of @entity131 , the popular @entity5 website , told @entity133 that the contest is about national identity as well as music			0
" months of frustration over @entity0 's illegal annexation of @entity16 and @entity140 's anti-lgbt laws have left @entity141 angry , " @entity129 said			1
" the booing was a release , a statement of solidarity with @entity1 and @entity0 's sexual minorities			1
" it does n't help that @entity0 's love song features lyrics that some see as hinting at a border incursion			1
it goes , " ... living on the edge , closer to the crime , cross the line , one step at a time ... maybe there 's a day you 'll be mine			0
" @entity1 singer @entity159 , who performed a song titled " @entity161 , " said tuesday that she was proud to be representing her country			1
" actually , my main position is that i 'm proud that i 'm @entity1 and everything i do here is for the @entity1 people , " the 21 - year - old said			2
" i 'm not standing alone on the stage , there are 46 million @entity1 behind me on the stage			0
" the countries involved in the contest award a set of points from one to eight , then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs			0
they ca n't vote for themselves and they must announce the score in both @entity180 and @entity181			0
television viewers can cast votes in their respective countries through telephone hotlines , which count for half the final tally			0
the remainder of the vote is cast by national expert juries			0
the country with the highest points total wins -- and has the rather expensive honor of hosting the following year 's event			1
in the end , @entity1 's @entity195 scored slightly higher than her @entity0 rivals , finishing in sixth place with 113 points , while @entity0 's @entity202 twins took 89 points to finish seventh			1
a duo from the @entity206 finished in second place , with a @entity209 entry coming in third .			0

@entity21 's @entity24 wins @entity212 in @entity11
@entity0 and @entity1 made it through to final
tensions between the country have been high since @entity15 's annexation of @entity16
