-- has there ever been a rivalry in a sporting team quite like the one between @entity4 and @entity5 ? their fractious , not to say poisonous , relationship reached a new low on sunday , after the three - time world champion ignored @entity10 team orders to snatch victory from @entity12 at the @entity14 @entity13			1
with another three weeks before the next grand prix -- the @entity16 gp on april 14 -- @entity5 plans to going surfing as he reflects on his treatment by @entity4 and his place in the @entity10 hierarchy			1
" i 'll be catching a few waves on my surfboard and reflecting on everything that 's happened , " @entity5 told reporters			0
" there were a lot of things going through my head in those closing laps , " he said			0
" not just from today , but from the past as well			0
" the past probably includes the @entity30 , a race in which @entity5 was flying when , on the verge of a hat - trick of wins , he and @entity4 famously crashed -- leading to a sense of ill feeling within the team			1
despite protestations in public to say otherwise from team principal @entity41 , the frustration for @entity5 is that he is very much the team 's understudy			2
@entity4 has long been nurtured by @entity43 , titled a motorsport consultant at @entity10 but widely regarded as the eyes , ears and mouth piece of team owner @entity48 , and a figure @entity5 has not always seen eye to eye with			1
" @entity56 made his own decisions and will have protection as usual , " continued @entity5 after sunday 's race , a not too subtle reference to the @entity55 's apparent place in the @entity10 pecking order			1
" it 's something that @entity4 has apologized for and it 's something that we will discuss internally as a team , " added @entity41 , who in february at the launch of the @entity63 had insisted : " as a team we will do the very best we can to support both drivers			2
" but former @entity68 driver @entity67 went so far as to say that @entity10 should suspend @entity4 for one race			1
" if @entity41 does n't reassert his authority in the team -- because he has been totally subjugated by @entity4 yesterday -- then his position in the team is not exactly the role it is designed to be , " @entity67 told @entity70 on monday			1
" the only conclusion i can reach is that @entity4 should be suspended for the next grand prix			0
" you ca n't take the points away from him and give them to @entity5 - that 's now history and @entity4 has the benefit of those seven additional points			2
" after the event , @entity4 was apologetic , suggesting the incident had been a misunderstanding rather than a direct violation of team orders			1
" i did n't mean to and i apologize , " @entity4 told reporters			0
" i 'm not happy i 've won , i made a mistake and if i could undo it i would			0
it 's not easy right now and i owe apologies to @entity5 and the team			0
" the @entity94 also raised more questions about the very essence of the sport with teams handing down orders to drivers rather than allowing them to race			0
while @entity4 ignored a call to stay behind his teammate @entity5 , @entity101 benefited from team orders			1
the 2008 world champion claimed his first podium finish for @entity106 after colleague @entity107 was told not to attack him as both drivers were seeking to maintain their cars			0
team orders have long been a controversial part of @entity111 , and were banned in 2002			2
however , that rule was dropped in 2011 after it became apparent that teams were finding ways around it .			0

@entity4 *defies* team orders to pass and claim first win of 2013
