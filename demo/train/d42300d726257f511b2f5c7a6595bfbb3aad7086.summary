-- even from the moment they were set down in the @entity3 , @entity5 's immortal words " all men are created equal " have always been awkward and challenging			1
they 're not awkward and challenging because they 're incorrect			0
on the contrary , they 're some of the truest words ever put to paper			0
instead , they 're awkward and challenging because -- for a nation built by slaves , where only a fraction of the population owned land and even fewer could vote , where an entire gender was held at bay for centuries -- these words were the sand in our collective eye that urged us , always , to be better , fairer and more decent to one another			0
@entity27 , @entity28 's opponent in the historic debates of 1858 , asserted that the @entity30 was a contract between englishmen only			1
that excluded not only african - americans and @entity35 but also the @entity36 , the @entity37 , the @entity38 -- almost anyone but @entity27 and a few select friends			0
@entity28 retorted , " why , according to this , not only negroes but white people outside of @entity43 and @entity44 are not spoken of in ( the @entity30 )			1
... the @entity49 , @entity46 and other white people of the world are all gone to pot along with the judge 's inferior races			1
i had thought the @entity30 promised something better			0
" though he lost that race to @entity27 , a greater triumph awaited @entity28			0
on his way to his presidential inaugural , @entity28 stopped in @entity61 's @entity60 and said , " i have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the @entity3			1
" we are now 237 years into the history of the document that @entity28 so cherished , and even today , @entity5 's words are still awkward and challenging			1
we are still realizing the potential of " all men are created equal			0
" @entity71 has come slowly			0
less than a hundred years ago , women were finally constitutionally guaranteed the right to vote			0
just five years ago , @entity74 became the first woman to make a serious run at the presidency			0
this march , the @entity78 was approved			0
some opposed it or obstructed it because of a provision that would give @entity84 tribes authority by their own people to bring to justice a perpetrator of violence against a woman			2
there was also opposition to extending the law to apply to @entity95 people and immigrants			1
yet despite that opposition , the law finally passed			1
this week , the @entity97 at long last approved a law that has been before @entity99 in one form or another for decades			1
the @entity101 is a simple bill that would outlaw workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity , protections that are extended to all @entity44 on the basis of race , age , religion and other categories			1
the fact that this law does not already exist for the lgbt community will come as a surprise to many @entity44			2
eighty percent of the public believes that it is already against the law to fire , or refuse to hire , someone because of their gender orientation or identification			2
as @entity44 , we trust that @entity5 's words already apply to everyone , but that dream is not realized			2
now , the @entity97 has brought us one step closer to that goal , offering sweeping bipartisan endorsement to this bill that is supported by broad majorities of @entity133 , independent and @entity132 voters alike			1
but once again , it appears that the @entity134 is prepared to stand in the way of progress			1
speaker @entity137 said he will probably kill the bill by refusing to bring it to a vote			2
@entity137 's office is offering three key arguments for stopping this civil rights legislation dead , and each one is more phony than the last			2
he 's called it a job killer			2
( why , then , have more than 100 major corporations -- many in the @entity148 -- endorsed it ? and why is the @entity149 neutral ? ) he 's said it will increase frivolous lawsuits			2
( only if you believe that being able to challenge your boss if he or she fires you strictly because you 're gay is " frivolous			0
" ) and his staff has said this problem is already addressed by existing law			2
( this one 's just flat - out phony , and they know it			0
more than half the states in the country lack these protections			0
) contrast @entity137 to another @entity132 , @entity166 sen. @entity165 , who used his first floor speech since suffering a stroke in 2012 to address the issue of workplace discrimination			1
his speech was halting , but he felt compelled to speak because he " so passionately " believes in equal rights for all			0
" i think it 's particularly appropriate for an @entity166 @entity132 to speak on behalf of this measure , " @entity165 said			1
" in the true tradition of @entity178 and @entity28 , men who gave us the 1964 @entity181 and the 13th amendment to the @entity183			0
" even now , in 2013 , there are those in our society who , like @entity27 more than a century and a half ago , cling to a narrow and incomplete view of @entity5 's immortal words and would prefer for only some of us to be granted the full light of equality			1
but today i still have hope that folks like @entity165 on both sides of the aisle , as well as the broad majority of @entity44 who support this bill , will stand up , like @entity28 before them , and once again expand the circle of liberty to include everyone			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity97 passed a law that would end workplace discrimination against gays
@entity206 says the @entity132 might *thwart* the bill in the @entity134
she says the @entity3 's stance on equality rings loud and true
@entity206 : *congressional* *republicans* should extend equality to all people
