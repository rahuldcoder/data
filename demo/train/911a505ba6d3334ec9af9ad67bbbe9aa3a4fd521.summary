@entity0 -- the @entity3 soldier accused of killing 16 @entity5 civilians engaged in fraud during his career as a financial adviser and skipped out on paying nearly $ 1.5 million to an elderly client , according to financial records			1
before joining the military in late 2001 , @entity12 staff sgt. @entity11 was accused of multiple instances of securities fraud			2
that includes a may 2000 complaint alleging @entity18 bilked over $ 600,000 from an elderly @entity21 couple 's retirement fund , according to the @entity22 , an independent securities regulator			1
" we were taken advantage of , " said @entity23 , a former client of @entity18			1
" he took an awful lot of money from us that he turned into commissions for himself			0
" @entity23 said when photos first began to surface of @entity18 , he did n't recognize him			1
but when he saw a high school photo of @entity18 , he realized the suspect in the @entity34 killings was his former broker			2
@entity18 served as @entity23 's financial adviser and stockbroker from mid- 1998 to late 1999 and defrauded the @entity21 senior citizen out of at least $ 637,000 , according to @entity22 records			1
" he did n't pay any of what was owed to us , " said @entity23			0
" [ @entity18 ' ] financial problems have nothing to do with this , period , " said @entity43 , @entity18 ' attorney , in an e-mail response to a request for comment about the securities complaints			1
the arbitration conducted by @entity22 in 2003 found @entity18 jointly responsible for paying @entity23 $ 1,490,875 in damages and legal fees , excluding interest , according to the securities regulator 's records			1
@entity18 did not appear at the dispute resolution hearing , and @entity21 and @entity22 records indicate he never paid any of the amount for which he was found liable			1
@entity61 , the now - shuttered firm that employed @entity18 , and the firm 's founder , @entity65 , were also found responsible for paying the award			1
both the firm and @entity65 never paid any of the restitution either , according to @entity23			2
@entity61 was barred from dealing securities in @entity21 , according to the state 's @entity70			2
multiple voice messages left by @entity1 for @entity65 were not returned			0
the @entity74 , a federally mandated corporation , did award @entity23 a small amount of reparations , he said			2
sipc could not disclose any settlement details			0
" we were able to get a few thousand dollars from @entity74 , nowhere near the arbitration award , " said @entity23			2
" @entity23 , a lifelong epileptic , was admitted to @entity82 in november 1998 for seizures and remained bedridden for six months after his liver failed			0
it was during that time @entity23 believes @entity18 swindled him			1
" he took advantage of the fact that i was in the hospital , said @entity23			0
" i did n't feel i was a dummy			0
i have two master 's degrees			0
but at the time i could n't walk , talk , or swallow			0
" @entity23 said that by the time he returned from the hospital , mail containing the status of his individual retirement account had piled up in a cardboard box his wife , @entity98 , had set aside			0
after opening the letters , @entity23 discovered that @entity18 had sold off his @entity101 and @entity102 shares , trading them for penny stocks			1
his account had been reduced to $ 30,000 from roughly $ 1 million , @entity23 said			1
" he traded away my @entity101 shares , probably worth about $ 75 a share , that i had saved up since the early ' 60s , " said @entity23 , a former @entity101 employee			2
the @entity21 couple was never able to locate @entity18 after filing their formal complaint against him , making it very difficult to take him to court			1
@entity113 said his attorney at the time , @entity115 , advised him not to press forward with a criminal case			0
" we heard he was in the @entity119 and @entity120 , and i think he was in a couple different cities here in @entity21 , " @entity23 said			1
" he seemed pretty good at the start , but he was pretty flashy , too -- a bit arrogant			0
he led on like he was a big dealer , and could do just about anything that you wanted him to do			0
" according to regulatory records , @entity18 moved around between several different brokerages during his five years as a securities broker , never settling in for long at any of them			0
three years after the @entity133 ' complaint was filed , a @entity22 arbitrator found that @entity18 engaged in fraud , breach of fiduciary duty , unauthorized trading , unsuitable investments and churning			1
the latter occurs when a broker engages in excessive trading of securities in a customer 's account primarily to generate commissions that only benefit the broker			0
he was ordered to pay @entity23 $ 637,000 as compensatory damages plus interest and another $ 637,000 in punitive damages			2
the arbitrator also found @entity18 and the company responsible for paying $ 216,500 in attorneys ' fees and a filing fee			1

the @entity3 government 's regulatory arm is the @entity158			0
under @entity22 rules , the securities regulator can suspend or cancel the registration of a broker or brokerage firm if that party does not comply with an arbitration award			0
@entity22 does not take any further action to recover awards			0
@entity22 would not disclose whether @entity18 ' broker license was suspended , but @entity18 was last registered with @entity22 in december of 2000 , seven months after the @entity23 dispute was filed			2
he never returned to trading securities , according to @entity22 records			0
a separate complaint of unauthorized bond trading was filed against @entity18 by an @entity21 woman on june 9 , 2000 , according to an @entity176 report			1
in the report , @entity18 claims the illegal trading occurred after he left @entity178 " i would n't have expected him to do that , " said @entity23 when asked about the recent murder allegations			1
" but he is not a good person , in my opinion			1
