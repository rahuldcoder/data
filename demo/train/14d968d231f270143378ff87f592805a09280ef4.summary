states that have legalized marijuana for managing chronic pain have significantly fewer deaths from prescription painkiller overdoses each year , according to a new study published monday in @entity6			1
researchers looked at medical marijuana laws and death certificate data in all 50 states between 1999 and 2010			1
during that time , just 13 states had medical marijuana laws in place			1
" we found there was about a 25 % lower rate of prescription painkiller overdose deaths on average after implementation of a medical marijuana law , " lead study author dr. @entity14 said			1
in 2010 alone , he said , states with medical marijuana laws had approximately 1,700 fewer overdose deaths than would have been expected based on the numbers before such laws were passed			1
@entity14 , a primary care doctor at the @entity27 , has treated many chronic pain patients			0
" it can be challenging for people to control chronic pain , so i think the more options we have the better , " he said			0
" but i think it 's important , of course , to weigh the risks and benefits of medical marijuana			2
" opioid analgesics are a class of drug that includes painkillers like morphine , oxycodone and methadone			2
according to the study , the number of patients in the @entity48 with chronic pain who get prescriptions for one of these drugs has nearly doubled over the last 10 years , and overdose rates have risen dramatically			2
statistics from the @entity56 tell the story of a problem they say is now an epidemic : deaths from drug overdose have been rising steadily over the past two decades and have become the leading cause of injury death in the @entity48			1
in 2011 , 55 % of drug overdose deaths were related to prescription medications ; 75 % of those involved opioid analgesics			1
" prescription drug abuse and deaths due to overdose have emerged as national public health crises , " said @entity70 , a senior author on the study and associate professor at @entity73			1
" as our awareness of the addiction and overdose risks ... grows , individuals with chronic pain and their medical providers may be opting to treat pain entirely or in part with medical marijuana			1
" twenty - three states and the @entity89 currently have medical marijuana laws on the books			1
they address a gamut of conditions -- from cancer , @entity96 , multiple sclerosis to glaucoma -- where cannabis provides relief			0
in most states , chronic or severe pain is the primary reason			0
according to the @entity105 of @entity106 , more than 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain , including 100 million @entity48			2
the academy 's website describes chronic pain this way : " chronic pain persists			0
pain signals keep firing in the nervous system for weeks , months , even years			0
there may have been an initial mishap -- sprained back , serious infection , or there may be an ongoing cause of pain -- arthritis , cancer , ear infection , but some people suffer chronic pain in the absence of any past injury or evidence of body damage			0
" dr. @entity128 , a past president of the academy , said he 's not surprised by the study results or that marijuana might be a safer alternative to opioids for some people			2
" @entity135 believes that we need to do research on cannabinoids to determine its safety and efficacy , " he said			0
" the problem with medical marijuana is that we never know using marijuana what chemicals are being ingested			2
that makes it really unpredictable , but the use of cannabinoids may well have a place in the treatment of pain and other diseases			0
the @entity135 believes that the @entity152 should reschedule cannabinoids from @entity154 so that it will make it easier for research to be conducted			0
" @entity157 , director of the @entity159 's @entity158 , called the study flawed			0
he says although the study controlled for other possible explanations for the lower opiate death rate in medical marijuana states , it left out some of the most critical possible alternative explanations			1
" the study failed to examine the influence of expanded methadone and buprenorphine programs in states , or the possible influence of major law enforcement interventions ( e.g. pill mill shut downs and major operations by @entity152 in states like @entity180 ) , or even @entity182 utilization , " @entity157 wrote in an e-mail to @entity168			2
" the study also did not take into account prevention campaigns or strategies			0
" the researchers say the link between medical marijuana laws and overdose deaths is not completely clear , and admit there were some limitations to the study			1
for example , death certificates may not classify overdose deaths correctly and opioid analgesics reporting on these certificates may differ state - to - state			1
@entity14 said more research is needed before any recommendations can be made			0
" we ca n't know directly the underlying mechanism of our findings , but based on what we know , we think it could be due to safer treatment of chronic pain , " @entity14 said			0
" we found that medical marijuana laws might provide unexpected benefits to public health			1
as more states pass these laws , it will be important to continue collecting information to see if what we found may be happening in other states as well			2
" opinion : why marijuana 's moment has arrived federal marijuana bill would legalize some cannabis strains			0
