-- @entity2 in two dozen states from the @entity3 to the @entity4 and @entity5 are shivering this week courtesy of a distorted polar vortex			1
the rush of cold air it 's sending southward is the biggest visitor from the @entity11 since @entity12			1
the gifts it brings , however , are chilling and generally unwelcome			0
much of the @entity2 has plunged into a deep freeze from record low temperatures			0
@entity18 senior meteorologist @entity17 answers a few pressing questions about this phenomenon			0
what is a polar vortex ? what distinguishes it ? the polar vortex , as it sounds , is circulation of strong , upper - level winds that normally surround the northern pole in a counterclockwise direction -- a polar low - pressure system			1
these winds tend to keep the bitter cold air locked in the @entity35 regions of the @entity36			1
it is not a single storm			2
on occasion , this vortex can become distorted and dip much farther south than you would normally find it , allowing cold air to spill southward			1
how frequently does this polar vortex distortion occur ? the upper - level winds that make up the polar vortex change in intensity from time to time			1
when those winds decrease significantly , it can allow the vortex to become distorted , and the result is a jet stream that plunges deep into southern latitudes , bringing the cold , dense @entity35 air spilling down with it			2
this oscillation is known as the @entity56 and it can switch from a positive phase to negative phase a few times per year			0
this oscillation -- namely the negative phase where the polar winds are weaker -- tends to lead to major cold air outbreaks in one or more regions of the planet			1
where on @entity66 can this happen ? the polar vortex can lead to major cold air outbreaks in any portion of the @entity36 -- @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			1
this will lead to cold snaps in multiple locations , though not always			2
how dangerous is a polar vortex distortion as compared to a tornado or hurricane ? completely different type of systems			2
a cold air outbreak caused by the polar vortex is much more widespread and lasts longer than a single storm			1
with the widespread drop in temperature , however , you can see significant winter storms develop , especially when the cold air is initially advancing into a previously warm region -- much like the nor'easter this past week			2
when was the last big one to hit a densely populated area ? serious cold snaps happen several times a year , though in different regions of the world and with different severities			0
last march saw a significant decrease in temperature as a result of the polar vortex pushing into much of @entity71			1
many locations experienced an @entity103 holiday that was much colder than their @entity105 holiday			0
the @entity108 , for instance , had its coldest march in 50 years			0
if you get caught up in one , what should you do ? again , it 's not a " storm " that you get caught in			0
but when faced with significant cold temperatures , you should stay inside whenever possible , layer clothing if you must be outside , winterize your home and car , etc. is it a side effect of global warming and should we expect more events like this ? this is a hotly researched topic			1
in short , yes , it could be			0
it seems counterintuitive that global warming could cause significant cold snaps like this one , but some research shows that it could			1
we know that different types of extreme weather can result from the overall warming of the planet , melting of the @entity134 , etc. this includes extreme distortions of the jet stream , which can cause heat waves in summer and cold snaps in winter			0
parts of @entity71 have been battered by the worst storms for two decades during the past week -- are they related to the weather system in the @entity2 ? they are related in a sense , but i would n't say " caused by			2
" the storms in @entity71 are the result of a persistent pattern that has seen the jet stream parked near the @entity108 and @entity150 , which has brought a train of storm systems over the @entity153			2
this is the same jet stream , of course , that has plunged deep into the southern portions of the @entity2			0
so , the jet stream has been " stuck " in a position that is allowing cold @entity35 air to spill into much of the @entity2 and @entity160			0
but it is in a position that is bringing warmer , moist air from the @entity164 over @entity165 , resulting in the stormy conditions .			0

polar vortex is circulation of strong , upper - level winds that normally surround the @entity11
the distortion can lead to major cold air outbreaks in @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72
a cold air outbreak caused by the polar vortex is much more widespread than a single storm
research *suggests* the distortion could be a side effect of global warming
