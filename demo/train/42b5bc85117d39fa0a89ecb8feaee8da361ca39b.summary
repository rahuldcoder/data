-- the love affair between @entity3 devotees and their mobile communicators is becoming strained , and some of them made the quarrel very public this week after a service outage			1
fans often discuss the intimate details about why they are attached at the hip to smartphones made by @entity12 -- the clack - clack of the tiny keys , the feel of the trackball or square pad on their thumbs , the informative indicator light calling out for attention			2
they affectionately call it the " @entity3			2
" after the recent outage , which @entity12 says was caused by a server error , some longtime @entity3 users are writing goodbye letters on blogs , and on message boards operated and frequented by the @entity3 collective			1
@entity30 , a @entity31 member of a web forum called @entity3 , summed up the concerns , saying @entity12 has been " chipping away our faith " in the company 's ability to satisfy customers			1
in interviews with reporters , @entity12 executives issued apologies , which they also made public in a recorded video , but they avoided questions about whether they planned to offer incentives as compensation for the millions of customers affected by the outage			1
@entity12 did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter			2
by comparison , after @entity52 restored its network this summer following a lengthy outage , the company compensated users of its subscription service , and gave free games and movie rentals to all users			0
@entity61 has offered small discounts to customers affected by technical troubles			0
despite @entity12 's lack of public comment , an @entity68 customer in @entity69 wrote on the @entity3 message boards that he received a credit on his bill when he called to complain about the outage			1
@entity12 customers still holding onto their faith in the company should pay close attention to a conference being held in @entity79 next week			1
the pressure on @entity3 from competitors is mounting , and @entity12 's promised next - generation models , with dual - core processors and large touchscreens , are overdue			1
a @entity3 forum member , posting under the @entity86 , says he is giving up his @entity87 " after years of being treated like a battered spouse by @entity12 , " he wrote			1
his wife urged him to switch to an @entity90 , and he says he will acquiesce			0
@entity91 , the executive editor for technology website @entity92 , published an editorial on thursday titled " @entity12 , you 're dead to me now			2
" he writes that he has defended @entity3 , despite the lack of multimedia features , but that the recent outage has spurred him to switch phones and operating systems			1
@entity12 still has a comfortable hold on corporate buyers , who snap up large orders for employees			2
security experts tend to trust @entity3 more than other smartphone platforms			2
however , even tech departments in companies are becoming more lenient on this policy			0
@entity110 , who was waiting in line to buy an @entity112 for his wife at a store in @entity115 , said her company " has finally approved for her to switch from @entity3 to @entity90 , and her @entity3 is just falling apart			1
" in the now crucial mobile - consumer market , @entity119 and @entity120 both lead @entity3 in sales , a trend expected to continue into the crucial holiday shopping season			0
a combined 69 % of smartphone buyers say they plan to get either an @entity128 phone or @entity90 , while only 8 % indicated that @entity3 was at the top of their shopping lists , according to an @entity133 study from this summer			1
@entity12 is " struggling to compete against @entity120 and @entity128 , " @entity133 analyst @entity134 said in a phone interview			1
" the outage comes at a really opportune time			0
... you 've got , during the same week , the availability of the @entity112			1
" among the dedicated @entity120 followers who lined up outside stores around the world to buy the new @entity90 on friday , some reluctant people waiting at stores told @entity0 that they were there because they believed @entity3 was too far behind the technological curve			0
outside the @entity147 in @entity148 , @entity149 , a few spots behind @entity120 co-founder @entity151 in line , @entity146 held a spot for her son			0
she is a longtime @entity3 user , but she said she is changing allegiances			2
she will be inheriting her son 's @entity156			0
@entity158 , a 41 - year - old nurse in @entity115 , waited in a line across the country from @entity146 to buy her @entity90 , which will replace a @entity3			0
she is especially excited about @entity161 , the voice - assistant technology that @entity120 has promoted heavily			0
" i do n't know who made it ; i do n't care , " she said			0
" i just want the personal assistant			0
" @entity0 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0

a @entity12 outage this week *sparked* some outrage among @entity3 customers
@entity12 faces competitive pressure , most recently from the @entity112
@entity3 *addicts* are *threatening* to ditch their longtime phone of *choice*
