-- amid all the furor about the seemingly omnipotent military in @entity4 , the disbanded @entity6 - dominated parliament and the debate over whether the @entity8 will ban beer and bikinis , it 's tempting to mutter , " it 's the economy , stupid			1
" in 18 months of upheaval , all @entity4 's economic indicators have headed south			1
growth is a projected 1.5 % this fiscal year , far too feeble to provide a young and rapidly growing population with jobs ( 80 % of @entity4 's population is under age 30 )			1
unemployment , one of the engines of the revolution , is estimated to be as high as 25 % among the young			0
tourism revenues have fallen sharply , and foreign reserves have dwindled to $ 15 billion			0
according to the @entity25 , some 40 % of @entity4 live below the poverty line ; 14 million people subsist on less than $ 1 a day			1
institutions are chronically weak and corruption is endemic			1
president - elect @entity30 has his hands full			1
many critics say the military has handed @entity30 a neutered presidency doomed to fail			1
but economists who have dealt with the @entity8 's economic team describe the team as pragmatic , well - prepared and favorable to the free market			1
@entity39 , a noted economist who has helped his native @entity40 empower millions , has consulted with the @entity8			0
he says that when he met millionaire @entity42 , the @entity8 's first presidential candidate who was disqualified for legal matters , @entity41 described himself as " businessman " on his card			1
" they want to create a market economy for the poor , to bring them into the mainstream , " de @entity39 says			2
the @entity8 has pledged to reach a rapid accord with the @entity51 to cool @entity4 's borrowing costs and protect the value of its pound			1
the interim military government raised money by selling bonds to @entity4 investors -- but at rising interest rates , with the yield on the one - year bill reaching a dizzying 16 %			1
the new government will have to repay or roll over some $ 4 billion in short - term borrowing over the next six months			2
there have been several rounds of negotiations between the @entity67 and the @entity51 for a $ 3.2 billion loan , but they have yet to yield an agreement			0
that amount may now be inadequate			0
@entity72 , one of the @entity51 's senior officials for the @entity74 , summed up the challenge last month : " how can we help @entity4 now come up with an economic program that would restore confidence , protect poor people and vulnerable households -- and do so in a way that restores confidence during uncertainty ? " @entity83 , a senior fellow at the @entity84 who was recently in @entity4 , says the immediate priority is to devise a " bold , credible program to reduce the outflow of reserves , encourage investment and bring in other donors " through an agreement with the @entity51			1
he advises the new government to focus on two or three priorities			2
the first is tackling corruption , which resonates with every @entity4			1
" real progress on corruption will have to involve a partnership between the government , the private sector and @entity99 , " he says			1
he looks at the example of @entity101			0
after the fall of president @entity103 , the new government embarked on decentralization , partnering with nongovernmental organizations and civil society			2
results were not immediate , but the perception of change was			0
the second priority , @entity83 says , must be the subsidies that consume such a large part of the national budget			2
the country 's growing deficit could be cut significantly if fuel subsidies were removed			1
but that 's not going to happen			2
the @entity8 is anxious to protect the poor @entity4 who propelled it to power , even though 90 % of the subsidy benefits the wealthiest 20 % of @entity4			1
fuel and bread subsidies have long been an essential insurance against civil unrest in @entity4			1
the challenge for @entity30 and his government is to better direct them at those most in need			1
@entity83 says that over two or three years , the subsidy program can be refashioned as income support for the poorest , similar to the " bolsa familia " in @entity133 that has lifted millions into the middle class			0
gasoline stamps , graduated electricity tariffs and a shift in subsidies toward healthier foods -- away from bread and sugar -- all have a role to play , he says			0
@entity83 says the issue of youth unemployment can only be addressed if the public debt is tackled , something that could have been done already with support from the @entity51			0
but the interim government 's refusal to consider foreign financing squeezed liquidity out of the domestic credit market			1
@entity154 , a senior member of the executive committee of the @entity8 's @entity156 , says he knows it faces a tall order			2
" we are warding off the immediate devaluation of the pound and working to regain the trust of investors in the market , to assure them that stability will come under this presidency , " he says			0
one of their primary challenges , he stressed , is wiping away remnants of the @entity172 regime 's hallmark bureaucracy and patronage networks : " the economy is our first , second and third priority			1
" some still are n't convinced			0
" i 'm not sure i want to be investing my money when i know the @entity8 , with little experience in this realm , is at the helm , " says a senior member of losing presidential candidate @entity178 's campaign			2
" it does n't give me and many other liberals much incentive to invest in a civil state that might be compromised by @entity6 with unclear motives			0
" @entity188 , chairman of @entity189 , a start - up incubator based in @entity191 that provides money and support to young entrepreneurs , says fostering entrepreneurship in @entity4 is an oft - forgotten component of getting the economy on track			1
" really , this government should just get out of the way and let people work , " he says			2
" the revolution gave people a sense of empowerment			0
instead of calling up your dad to call up his friends to get you a government job , now @entity4 are thinking outside of the box , they want to make a difference			1
we have to nurture this talent , support creativity and harness the power as an economic solution			0
" but @entity188 worries that continued instability may prompt a brain drain among @entity4 's brightest prospects			1
he notes that most of the budding entrepreneurs that seek @entity189 ' mentoring are public school educated and from a lower economic bracket			0
" these are the people who ca n't just pack up and move to the @entity226 if things get bad , " he says			2
" and they ca n't be neglected			0
" @entity228 , director of research at the @entity230 , says the @entity8 knows this			0
" put simply , if they ca n't deliver on the economy , then they 'll hemorrhage popularity , " @entity228 says			2
" they know they ca n't fail , and they 're committed to delivering with a detailed free - market economic program that also focuses on social welfare			0
" @entity241 says the key to @entity4 's long - term prosperity is to find a way to liberate its anarchic " extra-legal " economy : the shopkeepers , craftsmen and traders who work below the radar to avoid corruption , taxes and the inertia of the bureaucracy			1
that would require the streamlining of some 300 laws , he says , and the creation of one organization that could bestow property rights and provide the " extra-legal " with a path to a more productive role -- unlocking the vast sums sloshing about in the informal economy			2
it would be a huge transformation , @entity39 says , and it will require promotion and smart messaging			0
" but there is a window of opportunity , " he says			0
" that 's what revolutions provide			2
" the same happened in @entity276 immediately after @entity277 , unleashing an economy that had been in many ways feudal until then			2
@entity241 's consultancy , the @entity280 , was commissioned by the @entity172 government eight years ago to study @entity4 's informal economy and concluded it was worth 55 times all the foreign direct investment @entity4 had received since the napoleonic era			1
but none of his recommendations was implemented			0
@entity241 reflects : " if you 're going to change things , your enemy is the status quo			0
" @entity292 , 23 , is the sort of young talent that @entity39 wants to see empowered			0
she 's a razor - sharp unemployed college graduate who makes a four - hour commute every day from the @entity297 governorate of @entity298 to a nonprofit organization called @entity300 in @entity191			0
she says the status quo simply ca n't continue			0
" though i did n't vote for @entity30 in the first round , he can bring the change we need , " she says			1
" @entity307 is from the poor , they understand			0
... they were oppressed along with all us @entity4 the past 80 years , they have a plan and they know that we ca n't go on like this			1
it 's the breaking point			0
" but the short - term political uncertainties -- no parliament , a military perhaps committed to that very status quo and a ministerial team yet to gel -- will complicate decision - making			0
and given the speed with which @entity4 's economy has deteriorated , time is a luxury the new government does n't have .			1

@entity4 's economy is badly suffering after a year and a half of unrest
it 's now up to @entity30 and the new government to turn things around
