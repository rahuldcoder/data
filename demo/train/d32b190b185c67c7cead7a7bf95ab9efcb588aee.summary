@entity0 -- after a nearly year - long investigation , police say they now believe 10 sets of human remains uncovered along a desolate stretch of @entity7 , @entity0 , beach are linked to a single killer			1
" the theory is now that we 're dealing with one serial killer , " @entity11 police commissioner @entity10 told @entity1 affiliate @entity12 on tuesday			1
he noted the killer did not " necessarily do the same thing all the time			2
" " what 's common here is the dumping ground , " he added			0
@entity10 previously said that only the bodies of four females uncovered in december were thought to be the work of a serial killer or killers			1
it is not clear what prompted the change			0
authorities have sifted through more than 1,000 tips related to the case			0
but it 's unclear whether they have shed any light on an investigation that has drawn state and federal agents and garnered national attention			2
in june , police upped the ante in their search for a culprit			0
the reward for information leading to an arrest -- once topping out at $ 5,000 -- was raised five-fold , making it the largest offered in @entity11 history			0
it was an apparent bid to fill out a case that some fear has gone cold			0
" we 're hoping the increased reward money will encourage somebody to come forward by calling the police in respect to the families and to ( the ) victims , " lt. @entity52 said at the time			0
at least 10 sets of human remains have been found in @entity63 and @entity11 counties since december			1
but the woman whose disappearance triggered the searches , 23 - year - old @entity67 , remains missing			1
the @entity69 woman was last seen in may 2010 at a private party at a home in @entity7 's @entity73 community			1
the first four bodies have since been identified			0
they , like @entity75 , had advertised for prostitution services on websites such as @entity79			1
their remains were found among bushes along a quarter - mile strip of beachfront property , according to police			1
more human remains were found on march 29 and april 4			2
@entity11 district attorney @entity87 said in may that the newly found remains were not believed to be connected to the first four victims			2
in september , authorities released composite sketches of what two unidentified victims might have looked like			0
authorities at the time said the evidence suggested two other killers dumped bodies along @entity99 in @entity100 , about 40 miles east of @entity0			2
" this investigation is not an episode of ' csi ' or ' @entity105 ' that is going to be solved in a one - hour period , " @entity87 said of the serial killer probe			1
" most likely , it ... is going to take a very long period of time to complete			0
" @entity110 was not immediately available for comment wednesday regarding police statements that the killings are now thought to be the work of a single killer .			1

police say they think a single serial killer is *responsible* for bodies found in @entity7
police previously thought only the first set of remains could be the work of a killer or killers
the body of the woman who triggered investigation is still missing
the women who were killed advertised prostitution searches on websites
