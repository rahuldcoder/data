fishermen and pelicans on the @entity2 have been angling at the same spot lately , and somebody is getting hurt awfully ugly : the pelicans			1
so many have impaled themselves on fishhooks , that for wildlife activist @entity9 it 's a record			1
" i 've been here 30 years and [ have ] never seen this many in such a short time			0
" the birds have been punctured by multiple hooks			1
" every one had two to four to five hooks in them , " she said			2
wildlife veterinarians in @entity20 have extracted the barbs out of eyes , bills , midsections and untangled fishing line from 38 birds in the last three days			1
and five more are on their way to treatment at the @entity30 of @entity2			1
" there are going to be some we have to do surgery on			0
it 's pretty intense ; it 's a lot like a @entity36 unit , " @entity9 said			0
and there are many more birds flailing near @entity40 's @entity39 , @entity9 said			2
wildlife officials and police are investigating to find out why so many of them are impaling themselves on so many hooks			1
for one , their numbers on land are on a seasonal rise			0
when winter sets in , hunger drives young birds ashore			1
" it 's colder and hard to find food , " @entity9 says			0
they also gravitate toward fishing boats in search of an easy meal : caught fish and fishing bait			1
but the gouging spate is not the norm			0
winters are usually slow for the center 's medical unit , where seven veterinarians work , but the fishhooks have them busy around the clock , the center said on its @entity68 page			2
wildlife educators are working to inform fishermen about the problem			2
many of the pelicans are already weakened before getting stabbed by the hooks ; they are emaciated and have parasites			0
many are unable to eat for extended periods and are dehydrated .			0

so many fishhook impalings are a record of sorts for wildlife activist in @entity2
each bird usually has multiple hooks *piercing* its body
veterinary *personnel* are working around the clock , taking hooks from eyes , *abdomens*
winter drives the birds ashore and to fishing boats , but this is *unusual* , activist says
