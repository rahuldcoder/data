-- the year 1989 launched the @entity2 golf tournament and the baseball film ' @entity4 ' but the latter 's famous line about how building a sports field in an unlikely setting would draw in major players can certainly apply to both			1
in fact , there are few better examples than what is today the @entity15			2
twenty - five years ago , the course was surrounded by acres of barren desert -- with barely a skyscraper to be seen in what was little more than a sleepy @entity21 trading post			2
nonetheless , the rulers of @entity23 had the finances and inclination to back their extraordinary vision for what is reality today			0
they also had the verbal skills to persuade @entity32 @entity31 organizers to stage an event far from their traditional home -- and in @entity35 for the first time			0
the results have been spectacular			0
on tuesday , the roll call of champions that turned out to celebrate the @entity2 's 25th birthday included some of the greatest names in the sport : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 among others			1
@entity50 , the first man to win a tournament originally called the @entity2 , was also in attendance			1
the only one of the 21 former winners to miss the anniversary was @entity56 , who died three years ago , but the legendary @entity57 was represented by son @entity58			0
the 23 - year - old law student , who made his debut on the @entity61 last april , went round in a respectable two - over par. yet most eyes were , as usual , on @entity44 , especially after the world @entity65 's disastrous seven - over round at the weekend at @entity67 , a course where he has recorded eight victories			1
woods finished in a tie for eighth position , paying the penalty for a double bogey after finding water on the 18th , but he seemed wholly untroubled by his poor start to the season as he played alongside @entity47 and @entity80 , who won last year 's @entity2			1
" playing with @entity47 is always a blast , " @entity44 told the @entity2 's official website			1
" i have known him for so long and he is almost like a big brother to me			0
" the 14 - time major winner first played in @entity23 in 2001 , when his reported appearance fee of $ 3 million generated plenty of global headlines			0
he has gone on to win the tournament twice , with his last victory coming in 2008 -- the same year as his last major triumph			1
tuesday 's event was won by @entity94 's @entity93 and @entity95 of @entity96 , who share the @entity98 trophy after both finished six - under par. " it 's a great place for me , it 's always good fun to be back and celebrating the 25th anniversary this year is also very special , " said world @entity101 , who lived in @entity23 for nearly a decade			1
" there 's not many tournaments going on for that many years and we had a great roll of champions here so it 's been a good event			2
" yet the real contest will take place on thursday , with a strong field featuring @entity44 , @entity93 and @entity115 among others			0
there will also be a special place for @entity119 , the 53 - year - old @entity120 who is the only player to have contested every single edition of the tournament			2
having finished sixth in the inaugural event , he has witnessed at first hand the remarkable transformation of @entity23 from empty space to thriving international metropolis -- a genuine field of dreams .			0
