-- if you think being a secret agent is all just one giant adrenaline rush , think again			2
cracking the safe at the @entity5 our mission on the other side of the world : retrieve a missing nuclear trigger before it falls into enemy hands			1
we do n't know whom to trust in @entity13			2
we ca n't speak the language			2
we 've got to conduct video surveillance on an always - moving target , decrypt a secret audio conversation when we can barely hear through the static , crack a safe and then escape from a heavily guarded compound			2
we kept the terrorists from getting the trigger			2
everyone heaves a giant sigh of relief			0
the three middle - schoolers in the group performed admirably			0
welcome to @entity5 at the @entity5 ( www.spymuseum.org ) in @entity39 " today intelligence is the first line of defense against ideology - driven terrorism , nuclear proliferation , and other threats to our country , " explains @entity27 , executive director of the @entity5 , who spent 36 years at the @entity29			1
the idea , he explains , is to put civilians like us in a situation that mirrors a real mission			0
but i 've got a bigger mission ahead this weekend : can i make a visit to the nation 's capital , museums and historic sites at every turn , fun ? i 've brought along two sixth - graders from @entity54 , @entity55 -- my cousin 's son , @entity58 , and his friend , @entity60 -- to see if i 'm up to the challenge			0
the kids loved @entity5 and the spy tools in the museum 's permanent exhibits -- a @entity67 listening device hidden inside the heel of a target 's shoe , a lipstick pistol and poison gas gun nearly as much as they loved the gift shop , which offered every spy toy imaginable			1
new lasers in hand , we adjourn next door to the upscale @entity81 restaurant ( www.zoladc.com ) , which has a sophisticated ambience and menu to please the grown - ups , as well as a welcoming attitude toward kids ... not to mention terrific fries			1
( memo to parents : if you take kids to a restaurant like this and they 've outgrown the kids ' menu , suggest they share a meal -- assuming they want the same thing			1
) over dinner , the boys confess that learning about intelligence gathering was a lot more fun than learning how @entity102 works , and taking the @entity104 train ( www.amtrak.com ) was a lot more fun than driving or flying , because they could stay " plugged in " the entire trip , playing video games , watching movies and buying pizza and hot dogs			0
( kids ride @entity104 for half price			1
) the @entity115 , a @entity116 , ( www.hotelpalomar-dc.com ) , just a short walk from @entity119 and @entity120 ) proved an ideal choice for my " mission " too			0
the theme of this hotel is " art in motion " and when we get to our room , the kids find personalized cartoons drawn by a local cartoonist and an @entity131 to plug in their ipods			1
" this makes me feel like a king , " @entity60 declares , jumping on the bed			0
that 's exactly what general manager @entity142 , himself the father of young twins , wants to hear			0
" our job is to create an experience for kids as well as parents , " he explains			1
there is a treasure chest of toys for younger kids to borrow , a lending library of dvd movies and welcome swag that includes a card for free cookies from room service			1
( check the hotel @entity158 in @entity161 package that allows you to book one room at a going rate -- weekend rates start at $ 229 and a second adjoining room for the kids for $ 50			1
fall and winter weekends are a great time to visit @entity39 with bargain hotel rates			1
the boys , of course , would have preferred to never leave the hotel but i promise we can skip all the " boring stuff " " -- like the @entity177 , the @entity178 , all art museums and even the @entity180			1
but even without these stops , we had plenty to fill up our weekend			0
at @entity184 , ( www.jaleo.com ) , they sampled tapas for the first time -- but passed on the octopus and squid and reveled at being treated like grown - ups at the trendy @entity190 ( www.dccoast.com )			1
they declared " @entity192 , " which has been running in the @entity194 's @entity193 ( http://www.kennedy-center.org / ) for almost 20 years , a high point -- with campy humor and the opportunity for the audience to help solve the scissor - stabbing murder of a concert pianist who lives above the hairstyling salon			0
they also liked the view from the top of the @entity205 , though they were disappointed when they learned they had to take a 70 - second elevator ride rather than climb the 800 - plus steps			1
( tip : even in the fall , the entire day 's tickets had been given out before 10 a.m. arrive before 9 a.m. at the kiosk at @entity215 and @entity216 to get one			1
) the kids also gave a thumbs - up to the @entity220 ( www.bep.treas.gov ) where they watched from an overhead glass window , as money was made and sorted			1
note : though ( free ) tickets are n't required september through february , tours still fill up			2
you may need to wait			0
at the @entity228 ( www.nasm.si.edu ) where a new exhibit , @entity230 by @entity231 , will open next month , the boys were most interested in the gift shop -- until they discovered the @entity233 ( $ 8 each ) that allowed them to try their skills as a pilot and gunner aboard an @entity238 jet fighter			0
" i wish we could do it again and again , " @entity58 said			0
i insisted they see the original @entity242 but after a cursory look , they were done			0
sure i could have forced them to spend more time at the museum -- maybe i should have -- but that would have just made them cranky			2
instead , we all left happy			0
the @entity251 museums and the capital will be here next trip			0
