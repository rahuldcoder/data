-- the most impressive feature of the new @entity2 may be its ability to turn your finger into a password			1
touch id is @entity8 's name for a new fingerprint scanner that would act as a security tool for log - ins and for making purchases from @entity13 and other @entity8 stores			1
" your fingerprint is one of the best passwords in the world , " said @entity15 , a senior vice president for hardware design at @entity8 , in a promotional video			1
" it 's always with you and no two are exactly alike			0
" @entity8 unveiled the @entity2 , along with a cheaper , simpler @entity22 , at an event tuesday at the company 's @entity25 headquarters			1
on the new @entity2 , the home button will be made of sapphire crystal and act as a reader			2
according to @entity8 a fingerprint -- up to five prints from different users , depending on who else shares your phone -- can be read by the sensor from any angle to give access the same way a password does currently			1
the fingerprint data is encrypted , @entity15 said , and stored internally on the phone			1
" it 's never available to other software and it 's never stored on @entity8 's servers or backed up to @entity48 , " he said			1
the @entity2 is n't the first phone to have a fingerprint sensor			1
in 2011 , the @entity51 included one , though adoption among users was n't particularly high and the company eventually discontinued the feature			0
and at least one @entity57 phone to be released this year also will have the technology , according to a @entity60 report			0
some laptops and pcs have had fingerprint readers for several years now			0
but the technology has never really caught on , with users often complaining about them being balky and unreliable			0
maybe @entity8 can change that			2
" fingerprint sensors have come a long way , " said @entity67 , president of the @entity68 , an industry group advocating for universal security authentication tools			2
" they are by and large much better quality now and very readily able to detect ' is this just an image of a finger or a real - life finger ? ' " but while he called @entity78 " an exciting announcement , " @entity67 still sees some problems			1
first , he said , fingerprint scanning still is n't perfect			2
he mentioned his wife , an artist , who has trouble accessing her pc with a fingerprint scanner when she 's been working with plaster , which dries out her hands			0
" like many biometrics , it falls slightly into ' your mileage may vary , ' " he said			0
" if it works for you , great			0
but it may not work for you all the time			0
" the former chief information security officer at @entity94 , @entity67 also sees limitations to using the system for online purchases			0
while it may work fine on @entity13 or in the @entity99 , it 's not likely other web retailers are going to spend millions of dollars to make their systems accommodate an @entity8 feature used on fewer than 17 percent of the world 's smartphones			1
that means @entity2 owners who used @entity78 for purchases inside @entity8 's " walled garden " would still need to use other security tools to shop elsewhere with the same phone			1
@entity111 , director of the @entity113 's digital marketing program and executive director of its @entity115 , called @entity78 one of several " nice , " but ultimately underwhelming , features on the @entity2			1
" @entity78 ... could have been that killer app. but so far , it 's just a feature that saves you a couple seconds logging in , " he said			2
" if they can manage to link it to multiple profiles on a device , like the new @entity125 tablets , or make it a password to controlling smart devices in the home -- your stereo , thermostat , etc. -- that could make for a truly killer feature			0
but they just did n't get there today			0
" @entity136 , principal consultant at software security firm @entity137 , said that , if nothing else , @entity8 will widely expand the public 's understanding of the use of biometrics in the digital world			1
" people 's ideas about biometrics were as informed by @entity146 as they were by real products and experiences , " he said			0
" now , when someone asks the value of a fingerprint scanner , we can point to the @entity2 and use it as a reference , for better or worse			2
" esoteric and academic theories of usability , reliability , false positives , false negatives , and so on will suddenly be tested by millions of real users in real situations			0

on the @entity2 , @entity78 uses your fingerprint for security
fingerprint data is encrypted , stored on phone , not @entity8 servers
some experts say @entity8 's tech is nice , but wo n't be game - changer
