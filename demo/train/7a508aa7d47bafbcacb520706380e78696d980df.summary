" the @entity14 passed the measure 27 - 21 wednesday			0
president @entity16 and key administration figures lobbied hard against the measure , saying it would create unnecessary headaches for @entity4 relations with @entity2			0
@entity2 -- now a @entity23 member and a key @entity4 ally in the war on terror -- accepts @entity10 were killed but call it a massacre during a chaotic time , not an organized campaign of genocide			1
the full @entity32 could vote on the genocide resolution as early as friday			1
a top @entity12 official warned thursday that consequences " wo n't be pleasant " if the full @entity32 approves the resolution			1
" yesterday some in @entity40 wanted to play hardball , " said @entity37 , foreign policy adviser to @entity12 prime minister @entity38			2
" i can assure you @entity2 knows how to play hardball			0
" asked about ambassador @entity47 's recall after the news broke , a @entity45 spokesman said he could not confirm it			1
" people are sometimes called back for consultation ; sometimes they 're called back for other reasons , " said spokesman @entity50			0
" if they wanted to bring their ambassador back for consultations or do something else , that is their decision			0
i certainly think that it will not do anything to limit our efforts to continue to reach out to @entity12 officials , to explain our views , to engage them on this issue and again to make clear that we intend to work on this with @entity40			2
" @entity50 and @entity32 spokeswoman @entity68 said they both would like to see the resolution withdrawn without a vote by the @entity72			2
however , @entity50 said , " i do n't think anyone is expecting that to happen at this point			0
" @entity76 leaders said earlier if the @entity14 passed the resolution , they intended to bring it to the @entity32 floor			2

@entity32 foreign affairs chairman @entity88 , @entity90 , was unmoved by the @entity12 government 's protests			2
" the @entity12 government will not act against the @entity4 because that would be against their own interests , " he told @entity1			2
" i 'm convinced of this			0
" but @entity98 chairman @entity97 , @entity99 , sent a letter to house speaker @entity101 opposing the resolution , and said the backlash threatened by @entity2 could disrupt " @entity4 's ability to redeploy @entity4 military forces from @entity106 , " a top @entity76 priority			1
@entity2 , a @entity23 member , has been a key @entity4 ally in the @entity110 and a conduit for sending supplies into @entity106			2
defense secretary @entity113 said wednesday that good relations with @entity2 are vital because 70 percent of the air cargo sent to @entity4 forces in @entity106 and 30 percent of the fuel consumed by those forces fly through @entity2			1
@entity4 commanders " believe clearly that access to airfields and roads and so on , in @entity2 , would very much be put at risk if this resolution passes and the @entity2 react as strongly as we believe they will , " @entity113 said			0
@entity37 said no @entity127 planes have flown through @entity12 airspace since a @entity127 @entity130 committee passed a similar resolution last year			1
he said the response to the @entity4 might not be the same , but warned if the full @entity32 passes it that " we will do something , and i can promise you it wo n't be pleasant			0
" @entity37 spoke to reporters while in @entity0 to attend a meeting of the @entity139			0
in a statement on his web site , @entity12 president @entity140 said the resolution was " unacceptable " and " does n't fit a major power like the @entity4			1
" in a letter to @entity16 , @entity140 warned " in the case that @entity148 allegations are accepted , there will be serious problems in the relations between the two countries			0
" " we still hope that common sense will prevail and that the @entity157 will not move this resolution any further , " the @entity154 web site said			1

" @entity167 , " said @entity163 's front page , while @entity165 's headline read " 27 @entity166			0
" @entity50 said secretary of state @entity168 requested calls with @entity38 and @entity140 and planned to speak with the @entity12 foreign minister about the issue later thursday			1
@entity45 spokesman @entity172 issued a statement expressing " regret " for the committee 's action , warning the resolution " may do grave harm to @entity4 - @entity12 relations and to @entity4 interests in @entity179 and the @entity110			1
" the nonbinding @entity32 resolution said the deportation of nearly 2 million @entity10 from the @entity12 between 1915 and 1923 , resulting in the deaths of 1.5 million of them , amounted to " genocide			1
" @entity2 strongly reject the genocide label , insisting there was no organized campaign against the @entity10 and that many @entity2 also died in the chaos and violence of the period			1
@entity47 said the resolution 's passage would be a " very injurious move to the psyche of the @entity12 people			1

the resolution 's sponsor , rep. @entity205 , @entity90 , said the measure already had 226 co-sponsors , more than enough votes to pass " and the most support an @entity148 genocide resolution has ever received			0
" a similar resolution passed the committee by a 40 - 7 vote two years ago , but it never reached the full @entity32 floor			0
the resolution arrives at a particularly sensitive point in @entity4 - @entity12 relations			1
the @entity4 has urged @entity2 not to send its troops over the border into northern @entity106 to fight @entity221 separatist rebels , who launched some cross-border attacks against @entity12 targets			1
