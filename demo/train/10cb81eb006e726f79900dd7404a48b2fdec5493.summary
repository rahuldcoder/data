@entity0 , @entity1 -- at least three men died from their wounds wednesday after they were shot in a confrontation with @entity1 security forces at a destroyed historic site , the @entity1 government said			1
the men were part of a group of @entity13 tribe members who rushed to the site of the @entity15 of the @entity16 which was destroyed by fire tuesday night			1
exactly how many people were wounded remained unclear despite the government statement			0
while the government statement listed three dead and five wounded , the @entity1 @entity20 said it had ferried 23 injured people from the site to a @entity25 hospital , 11 of them with bullet wounds			1
" there several other cases , whose number i can not establish , who were either carried away by their relative or friends after sustaining bullet wounds			0
others were stampeded on as they ran , " said @entity1 @entity20 official @entity36 , who was at the tombs site			1
the tomb site is a @entity41 - listed cultural site of major significance to the country 's largest tribe			1
it was not clear what started the fire at the @entity15 of the @entity16 , which was built in 1882 and lies near the capital , @entity0			1
it contained the tombs of four ancient kings of the @entity13 people along with cultural relics , including the spears of past kings			1
tensions between the @entity13 and the government have historically run high , in part because president @entity59 is not from the tribe			1
there have been claims @entity59 favors his own people , a tribe in the west , and the @entity13 have said they feel persecuted			1
both the central government and the tribe began separate investigations of the fire wednesday			2
" we saw a huge fire popping out of the tombs as it rained , " said @entity70 , 49 , who operates a kiosk at the edge of the site			1
" the flames kept increasing high in the air and we had to close and ran away , fearing it would spread to burn us			0
" @entity59 visited the site wednesday morning			0
king @entity81 arrived moments after @entity59 left , along with @entity83 , the @entity13 kingdom 's information minister			2
are you in @entity1 ? share your view on the situation " we are getting all sorts of testimonies from our people whom we will use in our independent investigations , but we do not rule out acts of foul play from our enemies , " @entity83 said			2
a tense atmosphere gripped @entity0 hours later , with angry people lining the streets and armed soldiers on patrol			0
the tombs were on a hilltop around the former @entity13 palace , built in 1882 and converted into the royal burial ground in 1884 , according to @entity41			1
the main building was low and circular , topped by a high conical dome			0
@entity41 called the building " a major example of an architectural achievement in organic materials , principally wood , thatch , reed , wattle and daub			0
the site 's main significance lies , however , in its intangible values of belief , spirituality , continuity and identity			2
" the tombs are where the reigning king , or kabaka , frequently carried out important rituals related to the @entity130 culture , the largest ethnic group in the land - locked @entity133 country			2
the tombs were built in the " finest traditions " of local architecture and palace design , @entity41 said			2
the palace with its tombs " reflects technical achievements developed over many centuries , " the organization said			0
" it is a major spiritual center for the @entity13 and is the most active religious place in the kingdom			1
" " the @entity148 expresses its dismay for this tragic event that devastated the site and its related symbolic values , " the group said in a statement			0
" @entity41 is ready to mobilize international experts to help the @entity1 authorities in assessing the damage and envisaging remedial actions			0
" @entity157 at @entity158 were inscribed on the @entity148 in 2001 and were recognized as a masterpiece of human creativity both in their conception and execution , bearing eloquent witness to the living cultural traditions of the @entity13			2
" @entity13 kings have always built their palaces on strategic hills to control the major roads to the palace and find easy ways to escape in case of an invasion or rebellion			1
when they died , the traditional practice was to bury each king at a separate site to establish a royal shrine for his jaw bone , which was believed to contain his spirit			0
these shrines were staffed by descendants of the kings ' leading chiefs , his widows , his ritual half - sister , and a medium through which the dead king was said to communicate with his successors			0
many of the shrines are still maintained today			0
