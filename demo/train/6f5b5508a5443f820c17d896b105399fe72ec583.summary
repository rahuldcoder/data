-- for those of us who remember a time when many families did n't have color tv , a remote control or even video games , hearing the theme song from " the @entity9 " -- " they 're cousins / identical cousins , all the way " -- takes us back to black - and - white television sets and split - screen special effects			1
@entity16 says she has many fond memories of working on " the @entity9			1
" " back then it was very crude , how we did split - screen , " star @entity16 said of playing the dual roles of @entity16 and @entity9 in the show , which was developed specifically for her			1
" now with all - digital applications , it looks antique			0
but the show 's values are still what we want to impart on our children			1
" the first complete season of " the @entity9 , " from 1963 to 1964 , is now out on dvd			1
@entity29 told @entity0 that she 's excited her five granddaughters will finally be able to see what " @entity32 did when she was a teenager			1
" " i am tickled , just tickled , " she said			0
in the sitcom , which ran for three seasons on @entity36 , @entity16 was a rambunctious teenager who always managed to find herself in some kind of trouble ; cousin @entity39 was a demure , worldly @entity42 teenager who came to @entity43 to live with the @entity45 family to finish her schooling			1
@entity29 , who was not quite 17 when the series began , says it took a lot of energy to play two different characters			1
she preferred the quieter @entity39 , " because i thought she was dignified and gentle and rational			0
when it was time to be @entity16 , i would have to deal with my embarrassment of her stupidity			1
" @entity29 was already a successful actor by the time the sitcom debuted , winning an @entity59 for 1962 's " @entity60 " just months before the show premiered			1
but she describes herself as sheltered			0
" i was a very isolated teenager			2
when it came time to do some of the school dances [ on the show ] , they had to bring in real teenagers to teach me how , " she says			2
" i did n't know the dances , did n't know the music			0
" she says , however , the show was a relief during what were troubled times for her			1
she wrote about her tormented childhood in her autobiography , " @entity79 , " discussing her struggles with mental abuse at the hands of her managers , which she says led to alcohol and drug addiction			0
she was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder , and she now helps others who have the disease			1
" i believe that show [ gave me ] the tools that helped me survive through my youth until i got my diagnosis , " @entity29 said			1
" i think ' tormenting ' is one of the most perfect words for what you feel [ with bipolar disorder ] , because you have no control over it			2
i did occasionally , very occasionally , hear voices , but mostly my instincts were messed up : if it was dangerous , then i should do it			0
" the show , she said , " was where i went for safety			2
" " it was a troubled time on the personal level , but the show was never troubled , " she said			2
she speaks fondly of her co-stars , especially @entity107 , who played her father , @entity45			2
" he has always been able to make me laugh until i had to spit up , " she said of the now 87 - year - old actor			0
" he was also a solid , solid figure to me and still is			0
to this day , the relationship has grown , and he is always there for me			0
" she remains close to the other surviving members of the cast , including @entity116 , who played her brother			2
@entity118 , who played mother @entity119 , died three years ago			2
@entity29 was able to transition from child star to adult actor of stage and screen , and she even had a hit single , 1965 's " @entity125			1
" after " the @entity9 , " she played a drug - addicted alcoholic singer in " @entity127 " and won an @entity128 for the tv movie " @entity130			1
" to date , @entity29 has won one @entity59 , three emmys and two @entity132			1
@entity29 is also acting onstage in the musical " @entity133 " in @entity134 , @entity135			1
she plays the witch @entity138 , and though she finds the energy for eight shows a week a challenge , she loves the theater			0
" to me , it is almost a religious experience , the exchange between those strangers out there in the dark and us , " she said			0
" to me , that 's communication at its best , and that 's really what i enjoy			0
" @entity29 says she lets little faze her			1
" i 've gotten to the age where i 'm comfortable with just about everything -- except getting old ! " she said			0
even there , she 's willing to look at the situation without blinking			0
she teamed up with the @entity158 to do public service announcements encouraging seniors to sign up online -- using her old " @entity9 " characters			1
" on a positive side , i know about acceptance , " she says			0
" what 's negative for me is all very superficial			0
the incredible lines in my face			0
" but she says the wisdom that comes with aging -- and , of course , maintaining a sense of humor -- helps her deal with that			2
" without a sense of humor , " she said , " i would have been gone a long time ago			0
" @entity176 works for @entity0 -- and yes , that is her real name .			0
