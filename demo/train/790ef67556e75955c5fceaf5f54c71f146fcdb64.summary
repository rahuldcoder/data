@entity0 , @entity1 -- in war , one family 's story echoes the pain of another			1
i was reminded of that while watching @entity13 interview @entity11 's parents last week			1
spc. @entity11 , who forfeited a multimillion - dollar football contract to serve his country , died in @entity16 in 2004			1
many may consider this couple 's relentless pursuit for truth futile -- it wo n't resurrect their son -- but i understand it			1
it took me eight years to discover what really happened the day my father died in @entity26 's @entity25			1
they say the man who killed my father went nuts			1
i do n't know if that 's true or not -- he was dead by the time i got around to looking for him			1
i wonder sometimes if he took his own life			2
i could find that out easily enough if i really wanted to know , but i do n't			2
the men who were there in 1966 know how hard @entity36 took it			2
he and @entity38 were good buddies			2
our families often gathered for weekend barbecues and fishing along on @entity44 's @entity43 before the 25th @entity45 , stationed there , shipped out			1
they say that sgt. @entity46 drank too much			2
there 's some that say his drinking is the cause of the fratricide -- that 's what the @entity55 calls it when one of your buddies kills you			1
after @entity38 died , sgt. @entity46 sent @entity60 a rambling letter about how he wished he could marry her			0
that 's the sort of crazy thing a fellow says when he 's talking out of his head			1
the sentiment does n't offend me			0
it shows me how much heart he had , sober or not			0
when his widow learned that i was writing a book about what happened to my father , she hired a lawyer , who sent me a snarky letter by certified mail			1
the widow threatened a lawsuit if i quoted from her husband 's letter			1
she did n't have any legal grounds to stand on : you ca n't slander a dead man			0
i could tell you his name and quote from the letter if i wanted , but hurting others has never been the point			0
they say when sgt. @entity46 returned from @entity26 he did n't go home to @entity96			1
instead he went to a head hospital in @entity98			0
they say he spent months there , trying to forget everything he remembered			0
how that blast from sgt. c 's 105 - howitzer pushed my father 's guts straight out into @entity38 's hands			1
sgt. c likely overheard , the way others there that day did , my father pleading with the young doctor , " please do n't let me die			2
" these things happen in war , everyone says so , even @entity60			0
she did n't really understand why i needed to know the truth : " it wo n't bring your father back , " she warned			1
i was n't trying to bring @entity38 back -- i was trying make sense of a world gone mad			0
i did n't know when i started my search that my father was killed by his buddy			1
i was n't aware that there were two official @entity55 reports -- the first one the truth and the second one a lie meant to protect sgt. @entity46 and , if you believe military officials ( and i do n't ) , to " protect the family			2
" @entity11 's family does n't feel protected			1
his parents are in the news again , telling us , this time in a documentary , what they 've been telling us for the last six years : that their son was killed by men in his own platoon and that the military knowingly and willingly participated in covering up the truth to protect , not the family , but their own sorry asses			1
( excuse my potty mouth but there are times when behinney is the inappropriate word )			0
all this reminds me of a quote i read : " the central defect of evil is not the sin but the refusal to acknowledge it " ( dr. @entity154 , " @entity155 " )			0
the military only needs to practice the integrity they preach			0
instead they do the blame - shift thing			0
in an interview with @entity162 's @entity161 , the @entity55 officer who directed the first inquiry , lt. col. @entity164 , admitted officials knew which shooter killed @entity11 but he saw no value in going there			1
" i do n't think it really matters , " @entity164 said			0
the point , he said , is n't who really killed @entity11 but rather his parents ' lack of faith : " there [ have ] been numerous unfortunate cases of fratricide and the parents have basically said , ' ok , it was an unfortunate accident			1
' and they let it go			0
these people have a hard time letting it go			0
it may be because of their religious beliefs			0
" he went on to say : " when you die , i mean , there is supposedly a better life , right ? well , if you are an atheist and you do n't believe in anything , if you die , what is there to go to ? nothing			0
so for their son to die for nothing , and now he is no more -- that is pretty hard to get your head around that			2
" you may recall that at @entity11 's funeral , his younger brother @entity203 chided the crowd for their false piety : " @entity11 's not with @entity207			1
he 's f * * * ing dead			2
so , thanks for your thoughts but he 's f * * * ing dead			2
" it 's painful to see a brother come undone that way , in front of @entity207 and everybody			2
but given the propensity we @entity219 have to manipulate @entity207 for our own patriotic , and particularly militaristic purposes , i appreciate the pain that propels the @entity11 family			1
@entity224 ought to take a lesson from the @entity226 in @entity228 's tale , " @entity225 " : " man , in his weakness and shortsightedness believes he must make choices in this life			2
he trembles at the risks he takes			0
but no. our choice is of no importance			0
there comes a time when our eyes are opened and we come to realize that mercy is infinite			0
we need only await it with confidence and receive it with gratitude			0
and lo ! everything we have chosen has been granted to us			0
and everything we rejected has also been granted			0
yes , we even get back what we rejected			0
for mercy and truth have met together , and righteousness and bliss shall kiss one another			2
" if lt. col. @entity224 , and others charged with handling the @entity11 investigation , had only been as relentless in their pursuit of truth as they were in covering it up , it would have been a grace to the @entity11 family			1
a grace that may have helped them make sense of a world gone mad			0
a grace that surely would have enabled them to put their son rest and perhaps , restore to them , in some small measure , a glimpse of the @entity207 of mercy and truth			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity278 .			1

@entity278 said she relates to @entity11 parents , who spoke with @entity13
her father was killed by a fellow *soldier* in @entity26 , she says
@entity285 should have put its energy into finding the truth about @entity11 's death , she says
@entity290 : truth would have allowed @entity11 's parents to put their son to rest
