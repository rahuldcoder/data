-- with tanned shoulders and a wrinkled smile , @entity1 has the easy demeanor of a guy who knows his job			2
for nearly 30 years , he has worked at the same open - air food stall in @entity8 -- known as a dai pai dong -- flanked by open flames as he prepares dishes from fried rice to steamed clams			1
but @entity1 , now in his 50s , is one of the last examples of a dying cantonese culinary tradition			2
decades of urban transformation have decimated @entity8 's throngs of dai pai dong , supplanting them with glitzy malls and big name eateries			1
according to vendors i spoke to , there were hundreds of dai pai dong in the 1960s			1
today , there are just 28 left			1
it 's a shame , says @entity1			2
modern restaurants have " no culture , no taste			2
" stalwarts stand firm in @entity8 's @entity33 where skyscrapers crowd out the surrounding sky , @entity36 , named @entity37 , retains a proud tradition of old - school street life			1
on a sweltering weeknight , i sit on a sticky blue plastic stool under a faded red umbrella			2
patrons tuck into scrumptious dishes delivered by scrambling wait staff and the sound of hearty chatter mingles with the smell of cigarettes and kitchen grease			0
the key to @entity36 - style cuisine , he tells me , is wok hei , a @entity56 phrase that literally translates to " wok essence " and refers to the distinctive flavor that can only be achieved from a sizzling wok			1
by using scorching flames , boiling hot oil and a fast , muscular stir - fry technique that launches the food airborne ( @entity1 sometimes @entity66 © s two woks at once ) , the food is infused with a rich taste that evokes the brash old city			2
the stir - fried beef noodles ( hk $ 48 ) are springy , slick and satisfyingly salty			1
the grouper filet and seasonal vegetable ( hk $ 54 ) offer slippery bites of soft , savory fish and bok choy stir - fried @entity75 in a light sauce			0
they all have that home - cooked aroma that would send me running to the kitchen as a kid			0
the question is , will @entity8 's future children be able to experience dai pai dong cooking ? " it all depends on the government , " explains @entity1			1
lack of government support for years , @entity8 's administration has encouraged the decline of dai pai dong , which are viewed by some officials as fire hazards , health risks and public nuisances			1
according to vendors , the government has paid hundreds of dai pai dong owners to give up their licenses and no new licenses have been granted in decades			1
but locals say more should be done to preserve the tradition			0
" the government should protect dai pai dong , " said @entity102 , 24 , a cashier at a local dumpling restaurant			1
" they 're friendly , tasty , and cheap			0
my friends and i eat there all the time			0
" @entity110 , 81 , agrees			0
" i do n't know any ordinary citizen who would n't support them			0
you get more choices and cheaper food			2
but if you 're a rich guy who eats in hotels all the time , of course you would n't care			0
" despite their popularity , dai pai dong face an uncertain future			1
@entity124 licenses may only be transferred to relatives , but vendors say their children have no interest in continuing the trade			1
" they say this work is too difficult , the weather is too hot , " says @entity1			0
" when i pass away , the next generation is n't going to take over			0
" until then , @entity1 will continue doing what he does best			0
" there are n't many places that still cook like we do , " he says			0
" but if you 're someone who knows how to eat , then you 'll know how to appreciate it			0
" sing @entity37 : 9 - 10 @entity141 , @entity33 , @entity8			1

only 28 licensed dai pai dong , or *outdoor* food stalls , remain in @entity8
@entity124 *famous* for @entity56 *classics* like beef noodles and steamed clams
@entity150 is not offering new licenses , so future of dai pai dong is uncertain
