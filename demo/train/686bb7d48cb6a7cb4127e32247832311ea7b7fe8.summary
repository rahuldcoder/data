@entity1 , the @entity3 soldier held captive for five years by militants before his release a month ago , has ventured several times off an @entity8 base in @entity9 as part of the effort to get him used to everyday life in @entity3 , a military spokeswoman said			1
his release on may 31 in exchange for five @entity15 being held by the @entity3 military has rankled some , including former members of his unit , who said he was a deserter who endangered colleagues searching for him			1
yet while investigating circumstances surrounding his departure , the military has also said it 's focused on making sure @entity1 gets better mentally and physically , so he can gradually readjust to normal life			1
since being freed , @entity1 has been carefully monitored at a military hospital in @entity28 , @entity29 , and his home since june 13 , @entity32 - @entity31			2
he recently transitioned from inpatient care at @entity34 in @entity9 to outpatient care , the @entity8 said on june 22			1
still , @entity1 has hardly left the care of military health professionals			0
members of his reintegration team escort him whenever he leaves base and interacts with the public , the @entity8 spokeswoman said			1
his stops have included a library , a supermarket and several stores of his choosing			0
@entity1 has also eaten at fast - food and sit - down restaurants			2
the @entity8 sergeant is encouraged to pick the places , but because he 's not from @entity52 , he is offered some advice			2
" sometimes they sit at the table with him , " the @entity8 spokeswoman said of those on @entity1 's reintegration team who accompany him			1
" ... other times , they hang in the background			0
" during his trips off - base , @entity1 sometimes wears civilian clothing and others times dresses in his military uniform			1
in some instances while he has been in uniform , members of the public have recognized him and shaken his hand , according to the @entity8 spokeswoman			1
his reintegration phase will end sometime in the next several weeks , an @entity8 official said			0
he will then be assigned to an @entity8 unit , according to the official , though details of his next stop have not been disclosed			0
@entity1 went missing on june 30 , 2009 , in @entity82 's @entity81 province , where he was deployed with the @entity83 , @entity84 , 4th @entity85 , @entity86			2
an @entity8 fact - finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will , according to an official who was briefed on the report			0
but there was no definitive conclusion @entity1 was a deserter because that would require knowing his intent , something officials could n't learn without talking to him , a @entity3 military official told @entity100 last month			1
maj. gen. @entity101 is leading the @entity8 's formal @entity1 investigation , which will review previous findings			1
the two - star general could ask to re-interview anyone who can shed light on the case ; talking to @entity1 himself would likely be the last step in this investigation , one official said			0
as of the middle of last week , the soldier had n't been interviewed by investigators nor did he have a lawyer , one official said			0
military officials have talked to @entity1 about the days and years after his capture as part of the reintegration process			0
" we have no reason to believe that he engaged in any misconduct during that period of time , " one official said late last month , referring to @entity1 's time in captivity			2
no lawyer yet for @entity1 even though probe underway who was swapped for @entity1 ? fellow soldiers call @entity1 a deserter , not a hero			0
