-- twenty - five years ago , @entity2 college students in @entity3 , @entity4 , and @entity5 began gathering to publicly mourn the death of a purged high - level official , @entity7			1
a week later , thousands of students marched into @entity9 for @entity7 's funeral			1
the demonstrations escalated , culminating in the tragic military crackdown on the students on june 4 , 1989 when @entity2 troops opened fire on civilians and students			2
an official death toll has never been announced , but estimates range from several hundred to thousands			2
in the lead - up to the 25th anniversary of the bloody incident this year , there are mixed signals from the @entity2 authorities on their attitude towards the normally taboo subject			0
after three generations of leadership since the student protests , there are signs of the authorities loosening online censorship of related subjects , although direct mention of " june 4th " is still banned			1
marking death formerly the general secretary of the @entity39 , @entity7 was a close ally of @entity40			1
he worked with @entity40 to consolidate power and move @entity2 toward a more open political system , becoming a symbol of democratic reform			2
@entity7 died of complications from a heart attack on april 15 , 1989 , two years after he was purged by party conservatives for advocating " bourgeois liberation			2
" his death sparked a wave of student demonstrations across @entity2 that escalated into a hunger strike and the eventual military crackdown at @entity9			1
with such a close link to the crackdown -- which the @entity2 government has yet to acknowledge or apologise for -- @entity7 's name was banned from media until 2005 when his protégé , @entity59 , came into power and rehabilitated his mentor 's name			1
last week , retired president @entity59 paid his respects at the late @entity7 's former residence in @entity65			1
online reports and images of the visit were taken down by @entity2 censors			0
by tuesday , the official anniversary of @entity7 's death , his former residence in @entity3 was sealed and guarded by police , according to @entity75 media			1
the home is normally open to public on the anniversary			0
@entity7 's son , @entity79 , also visited his father 's cemetery yesterday in @entity65			1
he told the media that had gathered at the gravesite that he was bewildered by the lack of official contrition for the @entity9 incident			0
" what crime did the students commit ? " he asked			0
he further pointed out the contrast in the way authorities have handled the possible deaths of the @entity94 passengers against those of the students in 1989 , calling it a double standard			0
still touchy despite all this , @entity2 censors loosened their grip that same day			0
@entity7 's name could be freely searched and online commemorations began to flood microblogging sites			1
@entity2 news sites also published commemorative features on the ousted leader , including photos of @entity7 with his most famous protégés @entity59 and @entity109			2
the @entity110 gathered sentimental quotes from past essays on the late leader , written by other high - ranking officials			0
one by @entity59 reads : " after comrade @entity7 passed away , i would visit his home every @entity116 and gaze with deep affection at his portrait in the living room			2
his far - reaching vision and determined expression always gave me strength and encouragement			0
" but censors draw the line at any direct mention of the tragic crackdown			0
searches for " june 4 , " " @entity9 , " and " @entity130 " ( an official who was seen as sympathetic to the student protestors ) yield nothing			0
and by linking @entity7 's career to any discussion of @entity2 's political system , you will get swiftly banned from the @entity2 online world			1
an interview by the @entity139 with @entity7 's outspoken son , criticizing the lack of political reform and press freedom was deleted from the paper 's @entity145 account			1
as the june 4 date draws near , this litmus test of the authorities ' tolerance shows @entity9 is no less an issue after 25 years			0
from a @entity2 prison to @entity153			0

@entity7 's death sparked student demonstrations in 1989 , ending in tragedy

all other mentions of the student protests or political reform still censored
