@entity0 -- it 's confirmed : @entity3 is n't quite dead yet -- unlike the @entity5 parrot featured in a famous sketch			1
the @entity9 comedy troupe will perform live at @entity0 's @entity10 on july 1 -- the five surviving stars ' first show on stage together since appearing at the @entity14 in september 1980 , the group announced thursday			1
tickets will go on sale on monday , priced between Â £ 27 ( $ 43 ) and Â £ 90 ( $ 145 ) , with further details expected to be announced on the troupe 's website montyphythonlive.com			1
member @entity20 said at a news conference thursday that the show will have some new material , but it will have many old bits -- some featured in perhaps new ways -- that fans will expect			1
" i remember going to the @entity27 and seeing @entity28 where he got booed in the second half for singing new numbers			0
people really do want to see the old hits , but we do n't want to do them exactly in a predictable way , so it 's going to be a mix - up , i think , " @entity20 said			2
opinion : will @entity3 humor still fly in 2013 ? @entity20 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 and the @entity44 became comedic legends with the creation of @entity47 in october 1969			1
they produced 45 tv episodes for the @entity50 and five feature films together before going their separate ways in 1983			1
the shows mostly consisted of a string of barely coherent sketches , often lacking conventional punch lines and loosely tied together by @entity41 's stream of consciousness animations			0
although the tv show ran for only four seasons , it proved a massive cult hit when it was shown in the @entity63 beginning in 1974 -- just as the show was winding up on the other side of the @entity66			2
the five survivors have a combined age of 357 , meaning that some of the more slapstick sketches , such as the " @entity71 " could prove difficult for their aging bodies			0
but there may be more shows , " depending on how long @entity43 and @entity75 live for			0
" @entity42 paid tribute to @entity44 , who died in 1989 , saying , " we 'll miss him a lot although he will be appearing with us on stage in films			2
" " we 've told ( @entity44 ) that he 'll be on			0
if there 's a @entity83 , he 'll turn up , " @entity43 added			0
@entity1 's @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 contributed to this report .			0
