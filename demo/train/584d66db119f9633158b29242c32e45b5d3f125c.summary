@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 to represent @entity3 , a glorious dream			1
but that is what it has been for all this while , just a dream			0
over time , as years have rolled into decades , @entity3 have become more and more subjugated to the decisions and policies that our former colonial masters propose , and with the aid of visionless leaders , they tell us that it 's the best thing for the people			0
it is not the first time subsidies have been removed in @entity1			1
former president @entity20 reduced it eight times during his tenure , with the cost of gasoline increasing from 20 naira ( 12 cents ) to 70 naira ( 43 cents )			0
each time @entity1 were promised better infrastructure and investment			1
recently all subsidy was removed from diesel fuel and during this time , ordinary @entity1 have not seen any impact of the savings in their lives			1
in fact , life has become worse for them with life expectancy now at an average of 45 years , according to a 2010 @entity38			0
corruption has been the main problem of most @entity3 countries for over half a century ; it is shameful and disrespectful to the spirit of our forefathers ' struggles for a free @entity3			0
it has n't been too long that we recovered from the pains and delusions of an @entity52 - imposed structural adjustment program ( @entity53 ) in the country , which ran for more than a decade and put us in a worse situation than we were in before it was implemented			2
@entity57 , the then head of state , deregulated all sectors and removed government subsidies from almost every sector of production in line with @entity52 and @entity63 directives towards a more open capitalist economy			1
the result : inflation shot up			0
we recovered from the pain and delusions but the poverty still remains with us			0
this subsidy removal is the latest in a long line of foreign concepts and ideologies that are being forced down the people 's throats			1
what the @entity1 government has failed to realize is that we can not continue to model our economies on foreign blueprints			1
what is behind the fuel protests ? i believe the fuel subsidy removal is callous and does not take into consideration the hardships facing the people			1
@entity1 's @entity89 governor , @entity88 , stated in a town hall meeting on fuel subsidy that 90 % of @entity1 live on less that 2 $ a day			1
yet , the government choose to charge their own people $ 1 per liter for petrol , without consideration of how people are going to survive			1
this is treason against the people of @entity1			1
one of the reasons given for subsidy removal is that ordinary @entity1 do n't really benefit , but it is a secret cabal behind importing fuel that is benefiting from subsidy and removing it will kill off their influence in the market , but the people disagree with this			1
the people do not trust the government to honor their promises			1
we have heard different successive governments come in and say they are not corrupt and want to build infrastructure but end up being the exact opposite			0
we the people no longer want to be the doormats on which our politicians wipe their feet on their way into luxury and comfort			0
nothing has improved in education , agriculture , housing , or transport ; even our sports industry has been decimated			0
we have inadequate electricity in @entity1 so everything runs on generators ; even the power plants are powered by generators			2
these generators run on petrol and diesel fuel			2
with an increase in the price of petrol by 117 % from 65 naira ( 40 cents ) to 141 naira ( 86 cents ) and even 200 naira ( $ 1.23 ) in some places , virtually everything in @entity1 has risen in price overnight			1
how can the government even talk of saving any money with this kind of inflation crippling the buying power of the population ? @entity1 's government squeezed worse still , president @entity150 says he is introducing measures to help reduce our suffering and he comes up with 1,600 diesel buses as a solution			2
this is an insult to @entity1			2
this number of buses is not adequate for a population of 160 million			0
how is this a cushioning effect ? it does n't even scratch the surface of the pain we shall have to endure			0
that works out to 100,000 people per bus			0
i do understand that the government needs to raise money fast but the suffering of the people can not be an option			2
i personally support the removal of subsidy when our government fixes our refineries so we do not have to import petroleum			2
they also need to be transparent about how much it costs to actually produce a liter of petrol			0
we the people of @entity1 will fight for the right to survive in the face of tyranny and deceit and i am calling on all the great @entity1 youths to join the mass action and rally everywhere in the country and abroad			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			0

@entity195 says previous fuel subsidy reductions have not resulted in better infrastructure
the removal of subsidies , says @entity195 , is in line with @entity52 policy but harms @entity1
he argues that the people do not trust the government to honor their promises
@entity195 thinks the subsidy should only be removed when @entity1 stops importing petrol
