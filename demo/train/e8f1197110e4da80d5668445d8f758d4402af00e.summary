-- no evidence has surfaced of an explosion aboard a @entity6 cargo plane that crashed in @entity7 last september , officials in the @entity2 said saturday			1
but @entity2 authorities are seriously looking into a claim by a militant group that it was responsible for bringing the plane down			1
@entity13 , the @entity15 - based arm of the @entity17 terrorist network , claimed responsibility on friday for the september 3 crash , which killed two pilots aboard , and last week 's foiled plot to send parcel bombs to @entity24 synagogues			1
" the investigators did not report any explosion , only a fire in the cabin , " @entity25 , @entity7 's police chief , told @entity0 on saturday			1
" @entity7 police investigations revealed that an explosive parcel would have blown up the plane into pieces			2
" @entity34 , the @entity35 , quotes the @entity2 's @entity36 on saturday as saying that probe did not uncover evidence of a blast on board			0
however , the authority said , officials are taking the claim seriously and it is under investigation			0
investigators said earlier this month they had failed to turn up any evidence that terrorism was involved in that crash , which killed the two pilots aboard , according to a @entity24 government official			2
about 45 minutes after @entity50 departed @entity51 for @entity52 , @entity53 , the crew declared an emergency due to smoke in the cockpit			0
they asked to return to @entity7 , but shortly before the plane could get to the airport , it crashed			2
officials in the @entity2 have said -- and a @entity24 official confirmed -- that the plane 's cockpit voice recorder has been examined and nothing on it indicates an explosion			1
explosions have distinctive sound signatures , and that would have been recorded on the device , the official said			0
the @entity2 said it has " eliminated the possibility of an onboard explosion , following a detailed onsite investigation of the wreckage			2
" @entity77 counterterrorism chief @entity76 said sunday that the @entity24 is " looking very carefully " at the september crash to see if it could be related to the recent terror threat involving cargo aircraft			1
a @entity24 counterterrorism official said friday that while " there are very strong indications that @entity13 was responsible for plotting last week 's disrupted cargo plane plot ... we ca n't confirm at this point their claims about the early september incident			1
" the latest threat was revealed october 29 when authorities in the @entity2 and @entity91 found two explosives - laden packages sent from @entity15 that were addressed to synagogues in @entity95 , @entity96			0
the statement by @entity13 said that since @entity101 media did not link the september @entity6 plane crash to the group , " we decided not to announce it so we could carry on a similar operation			1
" " we did that this time using two devices , one of which was sent via the @entity24 @entity6 company and the other via the @entity24 @entity110 company , " the statement said			0
the statement said its " developed bombs will allow us the opportunity to detonate them in the air or after their arrival to their ultimate destination and they are designed to pass through all detectors			0
" @entity0 's @entity119 contributed to this report			0
