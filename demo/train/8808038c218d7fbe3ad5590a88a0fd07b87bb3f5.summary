@entity0 -- what is the state of @entity4 today ? how about a public shouting match at a committee hearing , with @entity8 chairman @entity7 then cutting off the microphones while the top @entity10 sought to make a statement			1
after the unseemly theatrics wednesday , @entity7 conceded that a nearly year - long investigation of @entity14 targeting of conservative groups may be approaching what he called a " dead end			1
" " it may well be that we have gotten to the bottom of it , " @entity7 told reporters after former @entity14 manager @entity19 again refused to testify before the @entity20 by invoking her fifth amendment rights			1
an aide to @entity7 said the committee chairman had yet to decide on whether to pursue contempt charges against @entity19			1
such uncertainty raises questions about whether @entity8 who have alleged the targeting order came from political higher - ups , even the @entity34 , can win a legal battle to compel @entity19 to provide testimony			2
" without that , it may dead end with ms. @entity19 , " @entity7 said of the probe			1
@entity8 contend the @entity14 targeted groups seeking tax - exempt status for extra scrutiny for political reasons , because organizations with names that included " tea party " and other conservative - themed words and phrases got screened			2
the @entity14 , the @entity50 administration and @entity51 reject any political motivation , noting that liberal groups also came under extra scrutiny because of their names			1
@entity19 , who was put on administrative leave and then retired last year from the @entity14 , headed the unit that did the screening			1
so far , she has refused to testify before @entity4 on the matter , and did so again wednesday before the panel chaired by @entity7			2
the move infuriated @entity7 , who has led a @entity8 investigation that so far has failed to find any political motivation behind the targeting			2
@entity7 adjourned wednesday 's session over the objections of @entity51 rep. @entity67 of @entity68 , who shouted back that the chairman 's actions were " absolutely un-american			1
" as @entity67 demanded to be heard , @entity7 declared , " we 've adjourned , " and signaled to the committee to cut the microphones by running the edge of his hand across his throat			2
@entity67 continued , speaking loudly because of the lack of amplification			0
" i am a member of the @entity4			0
i am tired of this , " @entity67 yelled			0
" you can not just have a one - sided investigation			0
there is absolutely something wrong with that			0
" afterward , @entity7 told reporters that the purpose of the hearing was to see if @entity19 would waive her fifth amendment rights and answer questions			1
when it became clear she would not , there was no reason to continue , the chairman from @entity91 said			0
" mr. @entity67 did not raise a point of privilege or a point or order , " @entity7 said , noting that he initially recognized @entity67 for a question			0
" he went into an opening statement			0
opening statements had already been completed			0
" pressed further , @entity7 said he had the microphones cut because @entity67 continued to talk during " an adjourned meeting			0
" " he was actually slandering me at the moment that the mics did go off by claiming that this had not been a real investigation , " @entity7 complained			2
to @entity67 , the issue involved allowing democrats on the panel to have a say			0
" we were basically shut out completely , " he told reporters , criticizing @entity7 and @entity8 for repeatedly distorting the panel 's findings through " cherry picking information , of sending just a few lines from various transcripts			1
