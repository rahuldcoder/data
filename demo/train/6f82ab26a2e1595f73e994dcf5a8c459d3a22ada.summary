the @entity0 , @entity1 -- after @entity7 @entity6 wartime leader @entity5 's failure to appear at the start of his trial on genocide and war crimes charges @entity2 senior international correspondent @entity3 explains what happens next			1
q : how does the @entity14 for the @entity15 ( @entity16 ) differ from the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) ? a : the @entity16 was set up by the @entity18 in 1993 specifically to try people for crimes committed during the break up of the former @entity15			2
the @entity17 is the first permanent , treaty - based , international criminal court established to prosecute the most serious crimes of concern to the global community including genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes			2
q : why did @entity5 fail to show up in court on monday ? a : @entity5 failed to show up because he wrote to the court several weeks ago telling judges he had not had sufficient time to prepare his defense			1
he is a " self - representing accused , " meaning he is defending himself			0
but he is backed by a large number of lawyers supported by a bevy of interns from @entity42 law schools			0
despite all this legal support , @entity5 says there has been too much evidence for him to go through			2
prosecutors say they have 490 hours of evidence to present			0
the judge wrote back to @entity5 last week telling him he does n't need to present his defense yet , he can do it after the prosecution			1
but @entity5 still refused to show			2
the court can not compel him to come even though he is held in a detention facility about seven minutes drive from the court run exclusively for those awaiting or on trial at the tribunal			0
the detention facility is a lot more comfortable than a conventional jail			0
@entity5 will be able to watch tv when he wants , he has access to books and can mix with other defendants			0
indeed , detention facility staff report that members of all three ethnic groups -- @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity7 -- mingle freely , even playing games together			0
q : can the trial proceed without a defendant in the dock ? a : the trial can go ahead without @entity5 present because there is no legal reason that says he needs to be there , even though he is defending himself			1
but the court is bound to give him a fair trial so if the prosecution begins without him the judges may give @entity5 a video feed so he can watch proceedings unfold			1
q : how long is the trial expected to last ? a : the trial could last at least two years and possibly three			1
the court allows at least one year for the prosecution and one year for the defense as a minimum			0
q : what measures have been put in place to prevent a repeat of the delays and obfuscation seen during the trial of the former @entity101 leader @entity100 ? a : @entity103 's trial dragged on because he defended himself , refused to accept the legitimacy of court and because of the complexity of the case and lengthy charge list -- 66 counts -- against him			1
@entity5 's case is less complex and this is one of the lessons prosecutors have learned from the @entity100 trial : make cases simpler and only go for those that can be readily proved			1
but with @entity5 defending himself and refusing to accept the court 's legitimacy , the judges are still struggling to figure out how to deal with tactics designed to delay the trial			2
they are likely to be less lenient than they were with @entity100 .			0

@entity5 says he has not had sufficient time to prepare his defense
@entity17 can not compel @entity5 to attend *bur* could put video link in cell
@entity17 has simplified case against @entity5 to avoid repeat of @entity100 trial
still , trial will last at least two -- and possibly three -- years
