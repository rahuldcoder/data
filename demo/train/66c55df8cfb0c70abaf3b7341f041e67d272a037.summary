-- @entity2 's billionaire mayor @entity1 can get pretty much whatever he wants , whenever he wants			1
yet the item at the top of his wish list does n't usually carry a price tag			1
" in some ways , there 's nothing more significant you can do for @entity2 than making their lives better by giving them more life , " explained deputy mayor @entity8			1
since taking office in 2002 , @entity17 has unleashed a tsunami of public health initiatives intended to do just that -- cutting sodium in prepared meals , ordering that menus in chain restaurants carry calorie counts , posting restaurants ' health department grades , as well as limiting the use of tobacco products			1
his first acts included a ban on smoking in restaurants and workplaces			1
in 2011 , the restriction was extended to public parks and beaches			1
the restrictions spurred a backlash of criticism			2
" i got a lot of one - fingered waves -- as i would describe them -- when i marched by bars on @entity48 , for example , " he told @entity0 's @entity43 last week			2
now , @entity1 said , attitudes have changed			1
" today , you march by a bar on @entity48 and everybody seems to love you , " he said			2
in fact , the policies have worked and have been widely copied , according to dr. @entity56 , an assistant commissioner at the @entity2 @entity57			1
since @entity17 took office , she said , the city 's smoking rate has dropped from 22 % to just above 14 % , " one of the fastest declines in the country			2
" that drop would be hailed as a major success by any other politician , but @entity17 is not easily satisfied			2
so this week , he unveiled the @entity69 , which would force retailers to keep tobacco products out of sight of customers -- particularly young ones			2
" what we 're trying to do is just deglamorize , do n't remind them , do n't make it look like it 's a normal product , " @entity1 said			1
" cigarettes are not a normal product			2
" its passage would be unprecedented , @entity1 said			1
that proposal too has stirred opposition			0
" the notion of forcing licensed , tax - collecting , law - abiding retailers to hide their tobacco inventory is patently absurd , " said @entity85 , president of the @entity86			0
opinion : why cigarettes are here to stay " this proposal arises from a wild theory that the mere sight of packs of cigarettes on a wall behind the store counter compels kids to start smoking , " @entity85 continuted			0
a spokesman for the parent company of @entity104 , whose cigarette brands include @entity106 , said the manufacturer opposes the measure because " we believe it goes too far			0
" @entity17 's eat - your - vegetables approach to public health has triggered cries that the 71 - year - old media mogul , politician and philanthropist has turned the city that never sleeps into a nanny state , one where finger - wagging admonitions about what to eat and drink and how to live have become annoyingly intrusive			1
this month , @entity17 's attempt to limit the size of soda cups to 16 ounces was rejected by a state supreme court judge as " arbitrary and capricious			1
" not surprisingly , @entity17 is appealing the ruling			0
risk and reward the mayor embraces risk and , though he does n't particularly revel in failure , he is not afraid of it , said @entity8			1
she recalled his telling a story of having spent a day skiing			0
afterward , a skier remarked proudly that he had not fallen once			0
" he said , ' that means you did n't try hard enough , ' " @entity8 said			0
" if you succeeded at everything , you left opportunities on the table			0
" @entity1 himself has left few opportunities on the table			1
after graduating from @entity140 with a degree in engineering , he got an mba from @entity144 and then , in 1966 at the age of 24 , he moved to @entity2 for a job with @entity147 , an investment bank			1
he rose quickly , eventually overseeing the firm 's information systems			0
in 1981 , squeezed out of the bank in a merger , he started @entity17 , the financial news and information company used by @entity155 's trading firms			0
it has made him rich			1
since then , he has donated more than $ 2.4 billion to a variety of causes and organizations			0
about half of that -- more than $ 1.1 billion -- has gone to @entity162 , which named its school of public health after him			1
" he 's driven by the metric of how do we make the most impact in terms of improving health and saving lives , " said dr. @entity166 , dean of the @entity167			2
" @entity174 is a data - driven guy , he 's a numbers guy			0
" @entity166 credits the businessman 's investments in public health with paying big dividends			1
" @entity2 is now the healthiest city in @entity180 because of what he 's done , " @entity166 said			1
it 's also one of the safest , with the lowest murder rate of any big city in @entity180			0
and traffic deaths and fire deaths are the lowest since the city started keeping records in 1916			0
" parents from around the country used to dissuade their kids from moving to @entity2 because it was dangerous , " @entity1 said last week			1
" that does n't happen any more			0
parents want their kids to move here because they 're probably safer than where they 're coming from			0
" putting a dent in obesity @entity17 's focus on food is recent and the data to support it are not as strong			0
" with tobacco , we have a pretty established set of policies we know are effective , but with obesity , it 's still new , " @entity2 health commissioner dr. @entity204 told an audience at @entity206 in @entity2 during a conference last fall on @entity17 's public health legacy			1
but talking about legacy is " a little presumptuous , " according to @entity213 , a lawyer with @entity214 , which has represented the restaurant industry			0
" the legacy is yet to be written on some of these initiatives , " he told the conference , adding that the evidence that such efforts would reduce obesity was itself thin and could wind up being counterproductive			2
" there 's a limited amount of capital , i think , that government has to engage in coercive measures , " he said			1
@entity17 sees restrictions on food as a critical component to his public health mission , according to @entity166			1
" he sees this avalanche of diabetes coming , " he said			0
" that 's why he attacks the sugar intake			0
" in reaching for opportunities , @entity17 has lost his footing several times			0
in addition to losing his effort to ban large , sugary drinks , he failed in his bids to get a soda tax adopted and to ban the use of food stamps to buy soda			1
the so - called soda ban provoked ridicule from some observers			2
" i think this is what makes liberals look like elitist bullies who think they know everything and can tell people what to do , " @entity247 said on his @entity249 show " @entity250			0
" " you should n't have to clear what you eat with the municipal government			2
" video : @entity262 mocks @entity17 's soda ban a executive with the @entity265 -- which represents 500,000 restaurant businesses across the country -- called the city 's efforts at change " heavy - handed " and was effervescent over @entity17 's most recent loss			2
" we very much questioned the efficacy of putting a dent in obesity by restricting the cup size in restaurants in @entity2 that sold sugar - sweetened beverages , " said @entity272 , the association 's executive vice president for policy and governmental affairs			1
" we do n't think that micromanaging food service packaging is the way to end obesity in @entity2			1
" @entity17 's attempt to limit the size of sodas inspired @entity289 -- whose 34.9 % obesity rate is the nation 's highest -- to pass an " @entity293 " law			0
" it simply is not the role of the government to micro-regulate citizens ' dietary decisions , " gov. @entity295 wrote			2
" ' @entity301 ' could n't write this stuff , " he said about @entity289 's move			0
" we have a worldwide , nationwide problem on obesity			0
this year , more people will die from overeating than from starvation -- first time in the history of the world			0
" " how can somebody try to pass a law that deliberately says we ca n't improve the lives of our citizens ? " he asked			0
" looking ahead while his critics might accuse him of simply trying to expand his political power through his health initiatives , @entity17 's colleagues say that 's not the case			1
@entity17 's focus is simple and singular , explained his former colleague dr. @entity328 , director of the @entity329			0
" any time i came to him for a decision , he only asked one question : was i certain that this would save lives ? " said @entity328 , who served as commissioner of the @entity335 from 2002 - 2009			2
" when it comes to failure - if he works on something for six months and it fails , the next day it 's as if it did n't happen			0
he is always looking ahead			0
" meanwhile , @entity17 appears to be meeting his goal of adding length to the lives of @entity2			1
a @entity2 born today is likely to live three years longer than a @entity2 born a decade ago , a year after he took office			1
" that 's a huge surge , and it puts us a little more than two - and - a - half years ahead of the national life expectancy , " deputy mayor @entity8 said			2
@entity8 predicted that @entity17 will remain focused on public health , even after he leaves office at the end of the year			1
" he 's very clear that that will , in fact , be a large part of the work that he does , " she said .			2

mayor @entity1 has made public health a top priority for @entity2
he has *touted* many *controversial* health measures since becoming mayor in 2002
critics denounce it as too much government ; supporters say the initiatives have worked
this month , a large sugary drink ban was set to take effect until a judge struck it down
