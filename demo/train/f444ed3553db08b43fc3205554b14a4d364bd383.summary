the @entity3 outbreak is " a growing threat to regional and global security , " @entity1 president @entity0 said thursday , telling a high - level meeting on the deadly epidemic at the @entity8 that only an international response can prevent " a humanitarian catastrophe across the region			1
" " if ever there were a public health emergency deserving of an urgent , strong and coordinated international response , this is it , " the president said			0
@entity0 has declared the epidemic -- which is centered in @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 -- a national security priority amid fears it could spread farther afield and claim many more lives			1
" this is more than a health crisis , " he said			0
" this is a growing threat to regional and global security			1
in @entity19 , @entity18 and @entity20 , public health systems are near collapse			1
economic growth is slowing dramatically			0
if this epidemic is not stopped , this disease could cause a humanitarian catastrophe across the region			0
" the president singled out @entity20 , where on wednesday the government declared a success a three - day nationwide lockdown put in place to help stop the spread of @entity40 , saying it had revealed more cases hidden in the community			1
under the plan , no one was allowed to leave their homes for three days , from september 19 to 21 , allowing volunteers to go door - to - door to educate people about the deadly virus			2
" the courageous men and women fighting on the front lines of this disease have told us what they need : more beds , more supplies and more health workers , as fast as possible , " @entity0 said			1
" right now , patients are being left to die in the streets			0
... one health worker in @entity20 compared fighting this outbreak to ' fighting a forest fire with spray bottles			1
' " @entity0 called the outbreak an " urgent threat to the people of @entity69 but also a potential threat to the world			1
" a rapid global response to the crisis " could be the difference between tens of thousands of people dying and perhaps a million people dying , " he said			2
the president also highlighted @entity1 ' efforts to help , including establishing a military command in @entity19 to support civilian efforts			0
but he urged international organizations and businesses to move faster to mobilize partners on the ground , and nations to contribute everything from air transport to health care workers to equipment			0
" we are not moving fast enough ; we are not doing enough , " @entity0 said			1
" right now , everybody has the best of intentions , but people are not putting in the kinds of resources that are necessary to put a stop to this epidemic			0
" the head of a medical organization at the forefront of fighting the @entity40 crisis also appealed to world leaders at the meeting to take immediate action or risk losing the fight to contain the epidemic			2
" generous pledges of aid and unprecedented @entity8 resolutions are very welcome			0
but they will mean little , unless they are translated into immediate action , " dr. @entity111 , international president of @entity112 , or @entity112 , said , according to an advance transcript of her speech			0
" the reality on the ground today is this : the promised surge has not yet delivered			0
" the sick are desperate , their families and caregivers are angry , and aid workers are exhausted			0
maintaining quality of care is an extreme challenge			0
" @entity111 said fear and panic have set in as infection rates double every three weeks in the worst - affected nations , while growing numbers are dying of other diseases like malaria because health care systems have collapsed			2
" without you , we fall further behind the epidemic 's deadly trajectory			0
today , @entity40 is winning , " she said			2
@entity20 : lockdown worked in @entity20 , more than 75 % of the targeted 1.5 million households were contacted , according to the @entity143			1
the strategy provided authorities with a " candid assessment of the situation , household by household , " said a statement from president @entity150 's office			2
" the true picture portrays a situation that is worse than what was being reflected in reports and reveals that there are more infected persons in the community , " it said			1
interactive : life inside the @entity40 outbreak hot spots isolated three districts have been identified as emerging hot spots , the government said : @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169			1
given the " desperate need to step up the response , " these will be isolated immediately , it said			0
" the prognosis is that without additional interventions or changes in community behavior , the numbers will increase exponentially and the situation will rapidly deteriorate			0
" the country 's @entity181 and @entity182 districts , which have been epicenters for @entity40 in @entity20 , remain isolated			1
can the world stop @entity40 ? deaths rising the total number of probable , confirmed and suspected cases of @entity40 was 6,263 , with 2,917 deaths , as of september 21 , the @entity187 said in its latest update released wednesday			1
@entity20 accounts for 1,940 of those cases and 597 deaths			1
however , cases and deaths uncovered during the three - day lockdown have not yet been included in the official figures , the @entity187 said			1
the other countries at the center of the outbreak are @entity18 and @entity19 , with a small number of cases reported in @entity203 and one in @entity204			2
the number of @entity40 cases in @entity19 and @entity20 could rise to between 550,000 and 1.4 million by january if there are no " additional interventions or changes in community behavior , " the @entity205 said in a report tuesday			1
the range of estimated cases is wide because experts suspect the current count is highly under - reported			2
the estimate was derived from a new forecasting tool developed by the @entity205			0
but the @entity205 estimates that if 70 % of people with @entity40 are properly cared for in medical facilities , the epidemic could decrease and eventually end			2
the virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids , and early symptoms include a sudden onset of fever , weakness , muscle pain , headaches and a sore throat .			0
