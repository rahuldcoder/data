@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's sultry rendition of " @entity5 " sung for president @entity7 's 45th birthday celebration marked the actress ' last major public appearance before her mysterious death in august 1962			1
tuesday , which would have been @entity4 's 84th birthday , marked the public debut of a rare image of @entity4 with @entity7 and his brother @entity14 together after the may 19 , 1962 , party			1
the black - and - white photo , taken by @entity18 photographer @entity17 , showed @entity4 still wearing the infamously tight - fighting , sheer rhinestone - studded dress she wore when singing earlier at @entity21			1
president @entity7 appears to be turning away from the camera , something he rarely did , while his brother , the @entity26 attorney general , looks toward them			2
" there is no other known photo of @entity34 [ @entity7 ] with @entity4 or @entity7 with @entity4 , and it 's not because they were never photographed together , " said filmmaker @entity29 , who now owns the only original prints of it			1
" in fact , they were photographed together many times , but the @entity39 and the @entity40 confiscated every single photograph			2
" @entity17 , who sold the prints to @entity29 a year before his death in 2008 , told him agents missed one negative in their search , he said			0
" @entity47 came in when he was developing the negatives and basically confiscated all the ones of @entity51 , @entity34 with @entity4 , " @entity29 said			2
" the only one that survived is the one that was in the dryer			0
" historian @entity56 , who was an aide to president @entity7 , appears in the photo holding a drink and cigar and wearing a broad smile			1
@entity56 's personal journal , published in 2007 , included his impression of @entity4 at the private gathering			1
" the image of this exquisite , beguiling and desperate girl will always stay with me , " @entity56 wrote			0
" i do not think i have seen anyone so beautiful ; i was enchanted by her manner and her wit , at once so masked , so ingenuous and so penetrating			0
" he wrote that @entity14 was paying great attention to @entity4 at the gathering , which was at the @entity73 home of @entity56 and @entity74			2
" @entity34 and i engaged in mock competition for her ; she was most agreeable to him and pleasant to me , but one never felt her to be wholly engaged , " @entity56 wrote in a passage included in his book " journals : 1952 - 2000			0
" while the relationship between the @entity7 brothers and @entity4 has become a documented part of history , photographer @entity17 was reluctant to allow the image to become public until after former first lady @entity89 's death in 1994			1
@entity29 said he bought access to the negative while working on an upcoming documentary about the actress 's death , " @entity4 : murder on fifth @entity95			1
" @entity17 , in interviews for the film , told @entity29 the story behind the first lady 's refusal to attend her husband 's birthday gala			1
" he 's the one who told @entity103 that @entity4 was going to be at the celebration , and her exact words were ' @entity106 , ' and she left the room and she did not go to the famous celebration , " @entity29 said			1
@entity29 's prints show details not clear in low - resolution , cropped copies that made their way onto the internet after the photo was licensed for a book about @entity4 in 2004			1
@entity119 @entity118 is seen in the background with his wife , talking to a man that @entity17 told @entity29 was comedian @entity123			0
@entity125 art appraiser @entity124 , who reviewed the prints and their history for @entity2 , called them " the real @entity129			0
" " this is a very significant piece of @entity26 and celebrity history , of fine art photography , " @entity124 said			0
since @entity17 was a @entity135 captain and was using a government - owned camera and film , the images themselves are in the public domain			0
but access to the negative , which @entity17 secretly kept , was valuable , @entity124 said			0
@entity17 made and signed 10 prints for @entity29 , 30 inches by 30 inches			0
nine of them go on sale tuesday at the @entity144 in @entity145 , @entity1			2
