-- back in 2004 , @entity2 's brilliantly subversive zombie comedy , " @entity3 , " introduced @entity5 audiences to @entity6 and @entity7			1
on screen the @entity9 mutt - and - @entity8 ( who teamed up again with @entity2 for 2007 's " @entity10 " ) had the spark - spraying chemistry of two best mates who wasted their youth finishing each other 's sentences at the local pub. now they 've all reunited for their third — and best — collaboration , " @entity19			0
" as in their previous comedies , @entity6 and @entity7 play men who refuse to stop acting like boys			1
but these pint - swilling @entity24 also know how to work the heart and the brain for belly laughs			0
@entity6 stars as @entity29 , a pathetic screwup still living in the past who cons his four closest childhood pals ( @entity7 , @entity33 , @entity34 , and @entity35 ) into returning to their quaint hometown after 20 - odd years to reenact what he calls the best night of his life : an odyssean 12 - pub crawl ending at a watering hole named the @entity41			1
@entity6 's @entity29 is a selfish cad , not to mention a raging alcoholic , but @entity2 's film throws in a jarringly apocalyptic sci - fi twist about the hamlet 's nonhuman denizens that gives him — and his stuck - in - a - rut buddies — a hilarious opportunity for midlife redemption			2
@entity2 does n't quite stick the landing : the finale is a little too shaggy and silly			0
but what do you expect after a dozen beers ? grade : b + see the original story at @entity0			2
