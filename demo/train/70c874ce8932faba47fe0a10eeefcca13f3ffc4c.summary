@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was looking at life with renewed energy : she had just survived a serious operation , and she was at a crossroads in her career			2
after 20 years as a producer in the stressful business of tv news , the challenge was n't there for her anymore			1
for eight weeks , as she recovered from the removal of a large noncancerous tumor from her uterus , @entity14 thought about her next steps			2
" i told myself i was going to work to do the things that i enjoy , things that are related to the news , " she said			1
@entity14 had recently conducted news production workshops for kids , so she already knew that she " loved people and talking to people about the news			2
that made me start thinking that if i could do it all the time and get paid for it , i 'd really enjoy it			2
" within a year , @entity14 had left her job at @entity2 's @entity33 network to start a @entity1 - based media consulting business with clients such as singer / actress @entity36 , former @entity38 singer @entity37 , actor @entity39 , actress @entity40 and former supermodel @entity41			1
during her journey , @entity14 learned that working for yourself often requires scary first steps , generous friends and mentors , and maintaining a healthy work - life balance			1
she 's the first to say that her story is not typical in any way , as she seemed to meet good luck at every turn			2
after her surgery , @entity14 , who also had worked at @entity2 and @entity52 , began saving money and planning her business			1
as if on cue , @entity33 offered her a buyout to leave the company as part of a downsizing			2
" it was my light bulb ' a-ha ' moment , " @entity14 said			2
" i was excited because in the back of my mind , it was what i had been praying for			2
" an opportunity to write a blog for a popular local women 's magazine got her some local attention			2
a journalist friend e-mailed @entity14 , saying that he had connected with @entity41 and suggesting that they meet			1
" she called out of the blue , " @entity14 said			2
" ' hi , @entity3 ! it 's @entity75 -- the model ! ' i was shocked			0
" @entity41 needed no introduction			1
@entity14 was very familiar with the first @entity80 - @entity79 model to win a cover on @entity82			1
in that year , 1974 , @entity14 said @entity41 's beauty and status spoke volumes to her as a role model			1
" when she called , i was like , ' shut up ! ' we were all like , ' no way ! ' i did n't think anything would come from it , but eventually , she said she would love to be my client			1
" @entity14 made short work of helping @entity41 successfully pitch her women 's health campaign to @entity2 , @entity52 and @entity94			1
" it was huge for me , " @entity14 said			0
" it showed me that the skills i may have taken for granted were very valuable to others			0
here i was doing what just came natural to me -- working with the media -- and i 'm helping an iconic figure			0
it gave me such a feeling of gratification , and it gave me so much more confidence			0
" but snagging @entity41 as her first client was n't easy			1
she had to start with smaller steps -- and the first step was a doozy : dealing with the fear			0
" for me , it was fear of failure , " she said			0
" anyone who has worked with me knows i am driven to succeed , and failure is not an option			0
" " but i 'm a woman of faith , " said @entity14 , a preacher 's daughter with strong ties to her church			0
" friends told me that ' faith will give you the wings to fly when you jump off that cliff			0
' " one way new consultants can boost their confidence is by compiling a list of experience and skills they 've gained during the past five years -- including successful projects , implementations and innovations			1
experts recommend referring to that list whenever confidence dips			0
@entity14 said she chose an area of consulting that was based on what she enjoys			1
" ask yourself , ' what would i do if i had to work for free ? ' " she says			1
another tip : find a mentor			1
" identify someone who 's successful and ask for practical advice , " she says			0
" i found my mentor at my church			0
" set aside time and money for a vacation , and guard it like gold , @entity14 advises			1
also , she says , determine how much income you need to stay afloat each month , and focus on that target like a laser			0
to be safe , experts advise aspiring consultants to start small , as a side business , while continuing to work elsewhere full time			1
but during a recession , keeping a full - time job and easing into consulting work is n't always possible			1
unemployment has prompted many experienced professionals to launch consultant operations simply to survive			1
" with the way the market has gone recently , there 's no shortage of people who are now saying that they 're consultants -- and many of them are not qualified to be consultants , " said @entity172 , president of @entity174 - based @entity173 " working for a company as an employee is very different from working for a company as a consultant			1
the credibility factor is critical if someone is going to engage you			0
" those looking to quickly build credibility or credentials to accompany work experience may consider offering to do speaking engagements at a local college or university			1
@entity14 showed her initiative by teaching herself to organize and lead an online seminar -- a webinar -- aimed at showing doctors how to better communicate on tv			1
financial planning is key to the success of a new consultant operation , according to experts			0
@entity14 set aside savings to live on during the initial phase of her business			1
it took well into her first year for her business income to fully support her , @entity14 says			2
that 's better than most new consultant businesses , experts say			0
it 's not unusual for new consultant businesses to take three years to make a profit			0
@entity14 says she 's still not making as much money as she did in tv news , but she expects to reach that mark this year			1
she works about the same number of hours now as she did as a journalist -- about 40 per week , if not more			1
" the big difference is , the hours are n't straight through -- they vary			0
" that 's not to say that @entity14 has n't made mistakes			0
" do n't assume that things will come right away , " she advises			0
" realize that the opportunities that come to you may not be in the form of money -- but they 're still valuable			2
" also worth keeping in mind : do n't overwork yourself			0
" i 'm still learning this , " @entity14 said			0
" i jumped in with both feet in the fire			0
do n't burn yourself out			0
" if she were launching her business all over again , she says , she would build more " me " time into her schedule			2
" i may take a day at the beginning of the week where i do n't take clients and do paperwork -- or i just get a massage			2
" what 's the best thing about being your own boss ? @entity14 laughs sheepishly			0
" i can sleep in if i want to -- and schedule an appointment for lunch instead of early morning			0
