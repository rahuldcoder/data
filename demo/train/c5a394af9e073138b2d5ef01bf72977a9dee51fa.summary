-- the practice of moving research involving human subjects from wealthy countries to less wealthy countries has grown in recent years , raising a number of ethical and scientific issues that need to be addressed , researchers said in a journal article wednesday			2
more and more clinical trials are being moved to less wealthy nations , a medical journal article reports			1
" the question is proportionality , " said dr. @entity14 , director of the @entity16 at @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , and one of the study authors			0
" we should test products where we are going to market them			0
the populations who take risks to participate in clinical research should be the ones that we anticipate will get the benefits of the research			0
" he and his co-authors reported in the @entity34 that in november 2007 , about one - third of clinical trials ( 157 of 509 ) were being carried out entirely outside the @entity36 , many of them in developing countries			1
between 1995 and 2005 , the number of countries where such trials were being carried out more than doubled , while the number in the @entity36 and @entity44 decreased , the researchers at @entity17 said			1
the shift appears to have been driven at least in part by economics -- a top medical center in @entity50 charges about a tenth what a second - tier @entity36 medical center would charge per case report , the authors said			1
another incentive to move such work abroad : other countries ' regulatory environments can be less burdensome			0
the authors reported one study that found only 56 percent of 670 researchers surveyed in developing countries said their work had been reviewed by a local institutional review board or a health ministry			2
another study reported that 18 percent of published trials carried out in @entity66 in 2004 adequately discussed informed consent for subjects considering participating in research			0
in addition , recruitment of study subjects can be easier in developing countries , where a trial subject may get more than a year 's pay to participate or participation could be his or her sole means of being able to get treatment , the authors said			2
transparency is yet another issue			0
" we know little about the conduct and quality of research in countries that have relatively little clinical research experience , " they wrote			2
@entity14 put it more bluntly			0
" we 've seen problems with people cheating on clinical trials , " he said			1
he acknowledged that similar problems have arisen in the @entity36 , but said such misdeeds were less likely to be found out when they happened abroad			2
of critical importance is the fact that some populations ' genetic makeup may affect their response to medication , the authors said			1
for example , they said , some 40 percent of people of @entity104 origin have a genetic trait that impairs ethanol metabolism and limits response to nitroglycerin treatment			2
" this finding may affect the relevance of trials involving cardiac , circulatory and neurologic disorders that are treated with nitroglycerin or nitric oxide - dependent therapies , " they said			1
the authors called for regulations governing trials to be reduced while ensuring ethical conduct , for greater use of centralized oversight boards and for research contracts to be written using standardized terms			1
" key strategies for clinical trials should be outlined in formal clinical - development plans , publicly vetted , and submitted to regulatory agencies , " they said			1
@entity132 , vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs at the @entity133 , said the industry will study the suggestions and weigh whether to incorporate them			0
" we 're constantly taking a fresh look at all our documents and revising them as appropriate , " he said			0
" the last thing any company wants to have happen is for a trial site to be called into question and that data then not used for review by the regulatory agency , which could put its approval status in limbo			0
" the matter has gained in importance with the announcement by the @entity154 administration that the government will carry out tests to determine which drugs work best			0
a spokeswoman for the @entity159 , who said she could not be identified because she had not sought permission to talk to the news media , said the agency has begun training and educating regulators in countries where clinical trials are being carried out for companies that are seeking @entity36 approval for their drugs .			1

in november 2007 , one - third of clinical trials were done outside of @entity36
trials in @entity50 , for instance , carry only about one - tenth the costs
