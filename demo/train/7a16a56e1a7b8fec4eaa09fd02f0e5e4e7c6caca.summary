editor 's note : @entity2 , the @entity3 , @entity4 - based host of a nationally syndicated radio show , is host of a television show designed to help viewers save more , spend less and avoid getting ripped off during these tough economic times			1
the show airs at noon and 4 p.m. et saturdays and sundays on @entity10			2
@entity2 says use the @entity11 to hook up with powerful networking groups			1
@entity3 , @entity4 ( @entity13 ) -- many years ago , i had the opportunity to start an @entity3 - based civic program called @entity17			2
the program 's goal was to provide free resources to help the jobless and underemployed find steady work			1
today , it 's 2009 and the need for job assistance is greater than ever as unemployment continues to rise			1
the conventional wisdom about education and employment -- that as your level of education rises , the less likely you are to be impacted by layoffs -- has been completely flipped on its head			2
this recession knows no boundaries in terms of education , skill level , training or years on the job			2
so , what do you do if you 're laid off or have your hours cut at work ? first , do n't panic ! you 're going to need to apply for unemployment insurance			1
i 'm hearing a lot of people badmouthing unemployment compensation			1
there 's nothing shameful about it			2
employers pay premiums over time during the good years to provide for those who get laid off in lean times			0
it 's not beneath you to accept this insurance money			1
next , you need to triage your finances so you know which debts to prioritize and which to neglect if your money runs out			1
paying your car note is central to finding employment for most people			0
it 's practically higher than paying your mortgage or rent			0
in fact , you may need to live with friends or relatives until you can get back on your feet			0
what should n't you prioritize paying ? your credit cards			1
people say , " but that will hurt my credit ... " look , if you 're in a situation where there 's no money coming in and you have to decide between paying the mortgage and putting food on the table , chances are your credit is already damaged			1
once you get organized financially , it 's time to job hunt			0
looking for work is a full - time job and you need an action plan			1
start by reviewing your list of contacts , but understand that people do n't like to be called and asked if there 's a job			0
but they do love to give advice that may lead to a job opportunity			0
visit in person with your contacts if possible			0
i 'm also a big believer in networking groups and unemployment support groups			1
networking for jobs has become something of a lost art in our country because people think the @entity11 replaces everything else			1
however , there are ways to use the @entity11 to hook up with powerful networking groups			1
there 's even a new organization called @entity121 that is like a free day camp for the underemployed			0
according to the movement 's web site , it 's " an ad - hoc gathering of unemployed and nontraditionally employed people ( including freelancers , entrepreneurs and startups ) who want to share ideas and learn from each other			0
" you never know whom you might meet			0
when you are job hunting on the @entity11 , be sure to check out screen - scraper sites like @entity136 and @entity137			0
they 're both " one - stop shops " that collect content from all the traditional job sites such as @entity142 and @entity143 , plus the career pages of individual company sites			2
in addition , the @entity146 recently recommended several specialty sites when you 're looking for work in a specific field			1
@entity151 is geared toward the science and biotechnology fields ; @entity154 focuses on the nonprofit charity world ; and for those who are 50 years or older , there 's a site called @entity159			0
in the course of your job search , you may find that you need money immediately and ca n't sit around waiting for a job offer to materialize			2
in that case , certain skill sets -- web design , programming , marketing and videography , to name a few -- lend themselves to consulting work or freelancing on a project			1
the internet also offers a variety of sites that match freelancers up with employers			0
a recent article in the @entity179 suggested @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 as starting points			0
and if you can afford it after all of your necessities , it 's always a great idea to keep your mind sharp by taking classes to improve your skills or learn new ones			2
you can never be too smart .			0
