-- @entity2 golfer @entity1 carded a solid 69 in the opening round of the @entity4 but it was his highly unusual recovery shot on the 12th on the @entity8 course at @entity9 which raised more than a few eyebrows			1
@entity1 did not leave much to the imagination with his @entity9 antics			0
@entity1 stripped down to the bare essentials -- a pair of white boxer shorts -- before wading into the mud to hack out his ball after an wayward tee shot			1
the watching galleries could hardly believe their eyes as the tall @entity2 peeled off his clothes			0
" @entity23 , trousers , socks , shoes , hat , the lot was off , " he told the @entity22			0
" because of the mud i could n't really afford to play in any of my clothes as they would have been a real mess down the last six or so holes so i had no option , " @entity1 explained			1
after getting the ball back on to the fairway , @entity1 eventually made a one - over par bogey on the hole when he could have dropped at least two shots by taking a drop			1
" if you are saving a shot , that has to be worth taking your shirt and trousers , " he added			0
what do you think of @entity1 's cheeky recovery shot ? the incident proved the main talking point on the day that @entity50 made his return to strokeplay golf and 32 - year - old @entity1 jokingly said it might offer a new avenue for sponsorships			2
" absolutely , you never know , after this i might have a new endorsement with @entity57 or something like that			0
" @entity61 @entity60 star @entity1 is playing for the $ 1.4 million first prize in the tournament in @entity64 which has an elite 81 - strong field			1
his recovery shot evoked memories of the last - hole drama at the 1999 @entity69 at @entity70 when tournament leader @entity71 waded into the @entity72 after taking off his shoes and socks			2
the @entity75 at least spared the blushes of the crowds by keeping on his clothes but he made a hash of hole and lost his chance of winning the famous major .			0
