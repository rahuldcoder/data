-- the internet is growing fast , but @entity2 is growing even faster			0
according to online security company @entity3 , @entity2 now represents an average 6.4 percent of all internet traffic			2
this is a new record for @entity2 , as it gained more than 1 percent of all internet traffic share since january			1
now , only one global @entity7 handles more traffic , and a lot of that traffic is @entity2 's traffic , anyway			2
the number is even more incredible if you consider that internet traffic is growing at a staggering 40 to 45 percent each year , and @entity2 is still gaining market share			1
however , @entity2 's share may be even bigger , possibly up to 8 to 12 percent , if you account for traffic offloaded by @entity21 deployments , @entity3 ' @entity17 claims			0
so far , @entity2 's revenue seems to be keeping up with its traffic ; we wonder which one will grow faster ? Â© 2011 @entity0			0
