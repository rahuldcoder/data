-- imagine not being able to hear a siren during an emergency or to see a warning sign to evacuate			0
imagine navigating knee - high mud in a wheelchair or trying to explain to a child with @entity7 why he or she must seek higher ground			0
those are just some of the challenges facing those with physical and cognitive disabilities -- people often least prepared to face a natural disaster			1
a largely overlooked report issued this month by the @entity17 found that the crucial needs of about 1 billion people living with physical and mental disabilities around the world are not woven into the disaster planning and emergency response plans of governments and civil society groups			1
the result is that a disproportionate number of disabled persons suffer and die in disasters because of a lack of attention to their needs			1
emergency response systems and shelters are poorly designed to handle their requirements			0
according to the report , 70 % of those with disabilities who responded to the survey in over 100 countries said they did not know how to tap into any existing emergency response system in their communities			1
they become largely dependent on the good will of families and neighbors			0
the report confirms the experience from recent catastrophes like the 2010 earthquake in @entity55 -- where deaf victims were trapped underneath rubble , unable to hear the sounds of rescuers drilling above -- and the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in @entity62 , where victims in wheelchairs could not board evacuation buses or get into temporary housing that had no ramps			1
and we have seen in the @entity69 during @entity70 and other major storms how those with disabilities suffer			1
in a @entity76 study of survivors , reports found that people with physical or cognitive disabilities faced considerable barriers to transportation , evacuation , and housing			1
dozens died in nursing homes and medical centers			0
many of the disabled survivors did not have jobs , making post-crisis transition even more challenging			0
it is tempting to presume that people with disabilities are small in number			1
the reality , however , is that roughly 15 % of people in the world live with a physical or cognitive disability -- many of them in developing countries that can not afford care and inclusion			2
in the @entity69 , 37.2 million @entity69 have some form of disability			0
despite the success of programs like the @entity69 with @entity108 , there are millions of people left without meaningful employment , education , and services before , during , and after a crisis			2
the @entity69 has a global imperative to address the needs of the disabled today -- especially in difficult fiscal times			0
leaving aside the moral obligation , there is an economic driver at work			0
worldwide , people with disabilities have higher unemployment rates than those without disabilities			1
in developing countries , 80 % to 90 % of persons of working age with disabilities are unemployed , whereas in industrialized countries the figure is between 50 % and 70 %			2
their exclusion from the workplace deprives societies of an estimated $ 1.4 trillion in gross domestic product			0
as we plan for disaster relief , as well as routine development and assistance , it is vital that @entity69 lead with a sustained commitment to those with disabilities			1
the @entity69 failure to ratify the @entity144 -- a convention signed by 155 nations -- reinforces a perception that @entity69 does not care about the disabled			1
yet despite the failure to ratify the convention , @entity69 has a good story to tell on inclusive development and disabilities			2
the @entity151 has led the way on supporting principles of universal design that not only fund specific programs to address the targeted needs of disabled citizens , but integrate disabilities into generalized programs that improve job training , education , quality and accessibility of care			2
over 75 % of @entity69 missions and @entity151 offices report activities and programs that specifically include people with disabilities			1
the @entity168 has a special adviser for international disability rights and has made enormous progress in expanding the range of @entity69 - funded exchange programs to include more participants with disabilities and to convene international experts around the issue			2
recently , a major conference took place in @entity179 , with leaders on disability rights from @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , the @entity185 , @entity186 , and @entity187 and representatives from @entity189 , universities , and government offices in the @entity69 , to address challenges facing persons with disabilities in their home communities			2
the @entity69 sent the first - ever official team of disabled sports envoys to @entity198 to promote inclusion and equality for persons with disabilities			0
this month we celebrate the 25th anniversary of @entity203 to pay homage to our own citizens with disabilities			0
the october campaign theme is " because we are equal to the task			0
" this is a good time to think about those at home and overseas who are marginalized and excluded because of disabilities and make sure we are doing our part			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			1

@entity215 : in disasters , the needs of those with disabilities should be in *forefront*
she says @entity70 , @entity62 and @entity55 earthquakes demonstrate the problem
@entity144 report says needs of a billion people are not being woven into disaster planning
