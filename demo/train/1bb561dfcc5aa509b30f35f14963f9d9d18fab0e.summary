-- @entity1 has taken many people by surprise by announcing that his vice presidential running mate will be @entity6 representative @entity5			1
the decision excites many conservatives who have been calling on @entity1 to go big			1
they believe @entity5 will inject some juice into a campaign they feel has been lackluster and put the focus on the policy differences between @entity1 and president @entity14			1
the primary risk with @entity5 , from what we currently know about him , is that his controversial budget plan and tough line on @entity20 could energize liberals and alienate elderly voters in key states like @entity24			1
he also lacks foreign policy expertise and has spent most of his career in the city that conservatives hate , @entity29			2
in recent decades , the record of vice presidential running mates who have come right out of the @entity32 is not very good			2
the risk of making the wrong choice for vice president was highlighted in 2008 by sen. @entity37 's selection of @entity39 gov. @entity38 , a decision many believe helped torpedo the @entity42 nominee			1
@entity38 struggled before the media , appearing inexperienced and unprepared for the @entity44			1
she also used aggressive conservative rhetoric that undercut @entity37 's appeal to independents			1
but for all the talk about what can go wrong with vice presidential nominations , it is important to remember how many of these picks have helped the ticket			1
very often vice presidential running mates have proven to be excellent on the campaign trail			2
they have compensated for the weaknesses of the person at the top of the ticket , they have played the role of attack dog and they have complemented the presidential candidate 's strengths			1
in 1952 , gen. @entity63 was determined to remain above the partisan fray			0
he wanted a campaign that highlighted his military record as @entity67 was bogged down in a military stalemate in @entity69			0
@entity71 sen. @entity70 served as an effective attack dog , taking on democrat @entity73 for being too weak in fighting communism , branding him " @entity75 " and saying the kinds of things @entity63 wanted to avoid saying himself			0
although a scandal involving a contribution fund @entity70 maintained as senator almost caused him to be dumped from the ticket , @entity70 turned the table on @entity83 by going on television and delivering the famous " @entity85 , " in which he turned public sympathy in his favor			2
after hearing the speech , @entity63 met with @entity70 and said , " @entity90 , you 're my boy			0
" a few years later , @entity70 fell victim to a good vice presidential pick when he ran for president against @entity94 in 1960			0
though he was disliked by many liberals , former senate majority leader @entity95 gave the @entity83 strong appeal in @entity99 states and also helped bring an impressive level of @entity29 expertise to the ticket			1
in 1968 , @entity70 picked @entity104 gov. @entity103 , who certainly brought his fair share of problems			0
@entity103 was mocked by his opponents as a little known politician and uttered his share of gaffes as well as ethnic slurs			0
yet @entity103 did contribute to @entity70 's victory by simultaneously appealing to the center , given his moderate record as governor in most policy areas , and to @entity99 , given his increasingly hard line on racial issues such as school busing and law and order			2
like @entity70 in 1952 , @entity103 served as the attack dog and allowed @entity70 , who had remade himself from an avid cold warrior into a foreign policy expert , to maintain his new image			0
in 1976 , @entity127 sen. @entity126 appealed to traditional @entity83 such as organized labor and african - americans who were distrustful of @entity130 , an unknown southerner who did not seem sympathetic to the party 's core ideas			2
when @entity130 ran against @entity134 in 1980 , @entity133 gave the @entity42 ticket immense foreign policy expertise and @entity29 experience that helped @entity134 push back against criticism that he was just a lightweight @entity139 actor who would be unable to function in the corridors of @entity29			1
@entity142 sen. @entity141 proved to be a pitch - perfect running mate for @entity144 in 1992			0
@entity144 wanted to convey the impression that @entity83 were no longer the old " tax and spend " party @entity42 had enjoyed attacking			0
@entity144 was a southerner and part of a new generation of @entity83			0
@entity141 , a hawkish centrist who agreed with @entity144 , complemented the party message			0
together , @entity144 and @entity141 counteracted the ability of president @entity133 , and then in 1996 sen. @entity152 , to draw on the familiar campaign themes of the @entity42			0
simply the image of the two youthful men and their families generated excitement among voters			0
in 2000 , @entity159 surprised many observers when he picked former secretary of defense @entity161 , who was heading the vice presidential selection process , as his running mate			0
@entity161 did n't do much on the campaign trail , but he did provide a record of deep experience in @entity29 that counteracted @entity83 charges that @entity133 was a novice who lacked any gravitas			0
in 2004 , @entity161 would eviscerate sen. @entity172 's running mate , sen. @entity171 , during a debate that made the @entity174 look too young and too inexperienced			2
in 2008 , sen. @entity14 , who already had the wind to his back , took something of a risk with sen. @entity179 , who was notorious for his off the cuff remarks and gaffes			1
but @entity179 added value to the ticket , compensating for @entity14 's perceived inexperience and proving willing to engage in tough partisan attacks that @entity14 shied away from			1
it is possible that @entity5 could help @entity1 in the coming months --- - and he could use a boost , since he 's 7 points behind @entity14 in the latest @entity0 poll			1
if @entity5 's main role is to be the ideological messenger of the campaign or to become the main attraction , he probably will not be effective			1
based on the history , and the limited assistance vice presidential candidates can provide , what @entity1 needs is for @entity5 to strengthen his central message , namely that he has more economic expertise than president @entity14 , to convince right - wing as well as @entity202 that @entity1 would be a good president and to be able to engage in the kinds of tougher attacks that conservatives are clamoring for , the kinds of attacks vice president @entity179 has proven quite adept at handling for @entity83			1
anything more probably wo n't work , anything less will be a bust			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			2

@entity211 : @entity1 made what some see as a bold choice in @entity5
many believe @entity37 's choice of @entity38 in 2008 helped torpedo his chances , @entity211 says
but it is important to remember how many *vp* picks have helped the ticket , he says
@entity211 : @entity1 could use a boost , since he 's 7 points behind @entity14 in the latest @entity0 poll
