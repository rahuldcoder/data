-- there exists a school of thought that dictates if you think something catastrophic , then it wo n't happen			2
what would happen if my family died in a car accident ? what would happen if my house caught on fire ? " what makes men connect with the girl of their dreams after sparking with me ? " the author asks			1
two summers ago , i asked myself : would n't it suck if my first love met someone unexpectedly and got over me before i could begin to move on ? thankfully , my family and my house are safe , but my feelings , my love life , and my ego still need mending			2
" the text message appeared on the screen of my phone and i stopped walking			2
a group of my friends and i were leaving the movie theater , and it was as if all feelings he had for me were obliterated in one night			2
we broke up because he was studying in @entity37			0
poetically , we had expressed our feelings for each other just two nights before			0
then he became someone else 's boyfriend , and remained so , for much longer than he and i lasted			1
i should 've known it would happen , since it happens quite often			0
my first kiss , who refused to be my boyfriend , met the girl of his dreams while i still ached for him			1
they 're still together today			0
since then , i 've been the second choice for several more men			0
the most recent ones occurred this summer , when i tried and failed to win the heart of my friend @entity56 -- he started dating the person that he truly liked instead of settling for me			1
i lost @entity59 to his ex-girlfriend ( although , in that case , i think they belonged together anyway )			1
each time , i laughed one of those sad , desperate guffaws -- here we go again ! what makes men connect with the girl of their dreams after sparking with me ? another concept may be more applicable to my situation : the idea of a self - fulfilling prophecy			1
perhaps i 'm so aware of my " magic touch " that i 'm making it happen			0
while the first love arrived in @entity37 , i even warned him what may happen			0
at the time , though , he waved the thought away			0
" i 'm so picky , i rarely really like a girl like i like you , " he typed			1
a month later , he must 've been pleasantly shocked to discover my unfortunate power reached across the @entity82			0
when @entity56 told me he was dating @entity83 , i was angry i 'd let this happen to me again			1
he argued that it 's irrational to use my past experience to predict the outcome of my future relationships ( or my attempts at them )			2
i 'm sure that there 'll be a guy someday who does n't find me easy to move on from , but in the meantime i ca n't ignore the pattern and pretend that each time was a coincidence , as @entity56 had wanted me to do			1
i do n't know if there is a way to avoid the seemingly inevitable			0
each time i let my hopes conquer my superstition , there 's a crash , a burn , a deflation , and the temporary loss of the ability to giggle , but i choose the chance of being the girl before the girlfriend over giving up the chance for breaking my streak			1
