-- sheriff @entity1 of @entity2 , @entity3 , is challenging the @entity5 's request for certain documents in its investigation of alleged civil rights violations by the sheriff 's office			1
in a letter to the @entity5 on friday , @entity1 's lawyer said the sheriff could n't agree to the department 's september deadline to supply all documents requested for its investigation and questioned the government 's pursuit of broad access to documents , personnel and facilities in the inquiry			1
the letter , from sheriff 's office attorney @entity25 , alleged that the @entity5 's position that it is " entitled to any document it wants , to access any facility it wishes , and to interview any witness it wants , without limitation ... is simply unreasonable			1
" authorities are investigating whether @entity1 's policies and law enforcement sweeps discriminate against @entity38			0
@entity5 officials met tuesday with @entity1 and his lawyers to request additional documents in the investigation			2
the department formalized the request in a letter to the sheriff 's lawyers wednesday			0
the letter asked the sheriff 's office to send confirmation friday that it would deliver the documents by september 10			1
in his letter to the @entity5 on friday , @entity25 pushed back on that deadline , saying " we did not agree to a september 10 , 2010 deadline at our meeting , and we can not agree to one now			2
" as i am sure you are aware , " the letter continued , " @entity61 [ @entity61 ] like many other state and local governmental agencies , has limited resources which can not be deployed indiscriminately without a potentially negative impact on @entity61 's ability to perform its primary functions of enforcing the law and protecting the citizens of @entity2			0
" on saturday , a @entity5 spokesman said the department expects to receive the documents on time , despite the friday letter			2
" we 're reviewing the letter , " spokeswoman @entity74 said in a statement , " but as we have said all along , we expect the sheriff 's office to provide nothing short of full compliance with the law , as every other law enforcement agency in the country has done in similar circumstances			2
" if it does n't turn over the documents , the government has threatened to sue the sheriff 's office " to compel access to the requested documents , facilities and personnel , " assistant attorney general for @entity84 has said			1
@entity1 , who has called himself " @entity93 's toughest sheriff , " is known for his hard - nosed opposition to illegal immigration			0
detractors accuse him of discriminating against @entity38			0
supporters say the @entity5 's civil rights probe and its separate criminal investigation are politically motivated			1
in his friday letter to the @entity5 , @entity25 claimed that some of the requested documents were already in the @entity5 's possession			1
" i must say i was surprised at the apparent lack of command that any members of the @entity5 team had over these documents , " @entity25 wrote , referring to the tuesday meeting			0
" indeed many of the items your team claimed to need are among those documents that the @entity5 has and has had for quite some time			0
" @entity0 's @entity114 contributed to this report .			0
