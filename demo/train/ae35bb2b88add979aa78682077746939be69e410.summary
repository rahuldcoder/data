reports that @entity1 , the man who killed 77 people in a bomb attack and gun rampage in 2011 , has applied to study political science at the @entity6 have prompted anger in @entity8			1
the claim was first made by @entity8 broadcaster @entity10 and was subsequently picked up by other media outlets			1
@entity13 , rector of the @entity6 , told @entity14 the university does not provide information about individual applications or students for confidentiality reasons , so he was unable to confirm or deny the claim			1
but if @entity1 was to apply , he said , the university has a clear set of guidelines governing the decision on admittance and that policy would apply			2
@entity1 was sentenced to the maximum possible term of 21 years in prison last august for the horrifying attack , which targeted a government building in @entity31 and a @entity33 summer youth camp on @entity34			0
he is serving his sentence in a high security wing of @entity37 , where he has space for physical exercise as well as study and reading			0
but the suggestion that he might also be able to follow a course at the prestigious university from his cell has angered some @entity8			2
per @entity46 , a survivor of the @entity34 shooting who finished his political science degree last year , told @entity10 he would not have wanted @entity1 in his class			1
@entity8 pm : ' honor dead by celebrating life ' " it would have been very uncomfortable			0
i also understand others who think it would have been very uncomfortable			0
i mean that we ca n't expect people to just accept it , " he told the broadcaster			0
in the wake of the reports , @entity8 's education minister @entity61 said wednesday that the ministry was reviewing its rules on allowing inmates to study -- although that did not mean they would necessarily change			1
her statement appeared to confirm that @entity1 had applied to the university , and that his application had been turned down			1
" as far as the @entity72 knows he has not been accepted to any studies and he has been rejected in the normal admission process to the @entity6 , " @entity61 said of @entity1			1
students who meet the admissions criteria will not normally be excluded unless they pose a danger to other students and staff , she said -- an assessment that is made by the correctional service			0
but in @entity1 's case , even if he was admitted to the course he would not be taking part in the university 's normal classes , studies or exams , she said			1
" for an inmate of @entity1 's security level , it would be a matter of self - study in the cell , exams in the cell and possibly oral exams in the prison , " she said			1
when he was given a 21 - year sentence last year , after being judged sane , @entity1 was ordered to serve a minimum of 10 years in prison			2
the sentence could be extended , potentially indefinitely , in the future if he is considered still to pose a threat to society			0
meanwhile , comments from his lawyers suggest that @entity1 still seeks to voice and validate the extreme ultranationalist views he outlined in an online " manifesto " published before the july 22 , 2011 , attack and during his trial			2
a year ago , attorney @entity113 told the @entity8 press that @entity1 wanted to study political science and write books			1
and in an interview broadcast sunday by @entity14 affiliate @entity118 , @entity1 's chief trial lawyer , @entity120 , confirmed that his client was still seeking to disseminate his racist , far - right views from behind bars			1
he is not allowed access to the @entity126 , @entity120 said , but @entity1 writes letters and sends them to his supporters			0
" they then post them on the internet so that his opinions are still spread , " he said			0
@entity1 has even unsuccessfully tried to start a political party from his cell , said the lawyer , who has written a book about his experience defending @entity1			1
" his political project is not finished , " he said of @entity1			2
" he has his extreme right - wing opinions , and is still working to convince others to take up the same opinions			0
" @entity120 told @entity118 he is concerned that the kind of views espoused by @entity1 are not being discussed in wider society , allowing them to remain unchallenged			2
" in this , @entity8 has n't made any progress from where we were two years ago , on july 22			0
and that worries me , " he said .			0
