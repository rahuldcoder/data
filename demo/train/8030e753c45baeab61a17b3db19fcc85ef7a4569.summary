@entity0 -- @entity2 is chic these days , especially around the @entity3			0
the worlds of @entity7 , video games and comic books collided for four days at the annual @entity8 2012			1
gaming has always played an important role in this pop - culture convention			1
several of the larger @entity7 studios -- @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 -- sat out " the @entity8 " this year , which opened up more room for the growing number of online series from the likes of @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 as well as gaming			1
in some instances these worlds collided as @entity26 showcased the talent behind the live - action series " @entity29 : @entity30			1
" @entity7 also remains infatuated with games as a big - screen source of inspiration			1
@entity34 debuted footage from " @entity36 : @entity37 , " the fifth film in the successful franchise starring @entity40			1
@entity42 creators showed attendees a first look at " @entity45 , " which will hit @entity46 and @entity47 just a few weeks after the movie opens september 14			0
@entity49 and @entity50 offered a similar double feature with " @entity52 " making its movie debut in the main hall while just down the street the game makers showed its interactive cousin , " @entity58 : book of memories			1
" @entity60 explored the classic world of arcade games with " @entity63 , " a new computer animated adventure featuring the voices of @entity66 and @entity67			2
@entity68 will be releasing games for @entity71 's platforms based on this film			2
more game publishers used @entity74 to debut brand new titles , even though the show is just a month after the big @entity78 convention			1
but while that trade show is closed to the public , the @entity0 shindig allowed game makers to reach the socially active early adopters that @entity7 and other marketers have long coveted by giving them hands - on time with some of the biggest games of this year ( and next )			1
here are five new games worth checking out that debuted at the show : " @entity91 " ( @entity89 , pc , @entity47 , @entity46 , 2013 ) while @entity92 continues to allow gamers to explore the world of @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 with @entity98 , that popular massively multiplayer online , or @entity101 , game only allows fans to play alongside those iconic characters			1
" @entity91 " is the first licensed comic book mmo that will allow players to step into the roles of @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 and a full roster of @entity91 superheroes			0
in the game world , @entity113 has gotten his hands on the @entity116 -- also known as the " @entity116 " in this summer 's " @entity118 " movie			1
it 's up to players to save the world			2
the game , at least at launch , will focus heavily on @entity124 , complete with @entity125 , but there will also be locations such as @entity128			2
fans can don their virtual costumes and play with friends starting next year			2
" @entity132 " ( @entity133 , @entity47 and @entity46 , 2013 ) @entity134 has made swords and sandals cool again with @entity138 's " @entity139 " tv series			1
now @entity133 and developer @entity140 are bringing the fighting action home in the first console game based in this graphic novel - infused bloody world			1
the game features actors from the show , including @entity150 ( who plays @entity139 ) and @entity151 ( who plays @entity152 )			1
fans will also be able to create their own gladiators and fight in the same arenas featured in the series			2
one catch that 's sure to pique the interest of fighting fans is that when a warrior has fallen in combat , if the victor decides to vanquish his opponent , that character is dead forever			0
that adds a whole new twist to the game 's online experience as players can build up powerful gladiators , train them and arm them with an assortment of weapons and then see them die in battle			2
the @entity175 and @entity176 title will debut in early 2013 in conjunction with the final season of the show , " spartacus : @entity181			2
" " @entity182 " ( @entity133 , @entity47 and @entity46 ) @entity183 returned to @entity74 , which helped generate buzz for the action flick that has become a franchise -- complete with a new game			1
developer @entity188 has worked closely with @entity183 to craft an original story that bridges the gap between the two films			0
this prequel to the august 17 movie sequel from @entity195 and @entity196 puts players in control of four characters from the movie -- @entity207 ( @entity183 ) , @entity202 ( @entity203 ) , @entity204 ( @entity205 ) and @entity206 ( @entity201 )			0
the four - player co-op game sends players on a mission to rescue a kidnapped billionaire			2
the action blends isometric shooting with vehicle combat in helicopters and tanks across locales such as the @entity219 deserts and @entity221 jungles			0
each character has a specialty , such as sniper or demolitions expert , as well as a signature kill that players can use , such as @entity207 ' dual pistols , for an up - close offing of an enemy			0
the game debuts on @entity176 on july 31 and hits pc and @entity175 on august 17			0
" @entity233 " ( @entity234 , pc , 2013 ) @entity234 , which also showcased the @entity47 exclusive prequel , " @entity237 : judgment " at @entity74 , debuted its first @entity239 4 game , " @entity233 , " during a panel			1
the gameplay is split into two unique experiences			0
players will explore , forage , collaborate and build by day in their own dynamic and expanding world			0
once the sun goes down , they 'll work together to defend their fortress from zombies and other assorted creatures			0
the building system has been designed so that players can use scavenged materials to build and renovate structures of varying materials and complexity quickly			0
the game , which offers a third - person perspective and overhead view of the action , shows off the potential of next - generation ( @entity261 and @entity262 ) visuals by giving gamers a taste of what @entity239 4 can do			0
the blend of strategy and survival horror serves as something fresh from the game developer best known for its shooters			0
" @entity233 " will be released in 2013 for the pc			1
" @entity273 " ( @entity68 / @entity274 , pc , @entity47 , @entity46 , 2013 ) fans of @entity278 's hit show " @entity273 , " based on @entity280 's graphic novel , already have a fun interactive adventure from @entity282			0
while that episodic horror game is based on the source material , developer @entity274 is serving up a prequel to the tv series starring popular characters @entity289 and @entity290			1
players will contend with " walkers " ( zombies ) as they make their way to the supposed safety of @entity296 after an outbreak has left the country overrun with the living dead			0
the first - person action game features @entity289 's crossbow as well as an assortment of other weapons that players can scavenge as they contend with obstacles living and dead in a brand new adventure			0
the @entity307 - winning series has been able to blend horror with drama , but this game will allow fans to experience this rich universe with an action and horror focus			1
these walkers are fast and can hunt down players in hordes , which makes for an interesting new game experience for the growing number of fans			0
@entity68 unleashes the dead in 2013 .			0
