-- @entity2 's deputy chief justice recently made the alarming announcement that his government might start training judges to cut off the hands and legs of convicted criminals , if doctors refuse to carry out amputations as punishment			1
@entity12 said non-cooperation over the use of such amputations would be punished			1
adopting a defiant posture , he denied his government had ever stopped the use of one of the most severe forms of " hudud " punishments , which are based on an interpretation of islamic law			0
@entity12 revealed that 16 people had been subjected to amputations since 2001 , although the first reported case was that of @entity26 , 30 , whose right hand and left foot were amputated by three doctors on 14 february			1
@entity30 had been found guilty of highway robbery			0
the amputation prompted a public outcry , particularly by the @entity34 , which complained that doctors were horrified to have to break the @entity36 -- to protect patients , and not harm them -- in order to comply with government orders			0
amputations are just one form of cruel punishment carried out in @entity2			1
since 2005 thousands have been sentenced on counts of adultery , which carries the punishment of flogging , and , in some cases , stoning			0
@entity49 was 23 years old and the mother of a six - month - old infant when she was sentenced to death by stoning on counts of adultery by a @entity2 judge last july			1
he did n't mind that she did n't have a lawyer to defend herself , or that she did n't understand what " stoning " meant			0
the second woman to be sentenced to death by stoning in 2012 , she spent two months shackled , alone with her baby , in @entity63 prison , near the capital @entity65			0
both women were eventually released on appeal , following intense campaigns by @entity2 and international human rights organizations on their behalf			1
others , though , are less fortunate			0
almost every day in @entity2 , someone is given 20 to 100 lashes on a court order for minor offenses , and following a summary trial			1
many such floggings are carried out in public			0
these punishments are cruel , inhuman , degrading and may amount to torture			1
they are a clear violation of international human rights law and @entity2 's own international commitments , notably the @entity85			2
they are highly controversial within @entity2 , which explains in part why the authorities have been unable to enforce them systematically			2
but for those affected , the suffering is real -- and revolting			0
as @entity2 reviews its constitution , it is imperative that the authorities respect their international commitments , and address the issue of corporal punishments and the death penalty as a matter of priority			1
such cruel punishments can no longer be tolerated			2
and laws need to be enforced and respected to put an end to them once and for all			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity108 .			0
