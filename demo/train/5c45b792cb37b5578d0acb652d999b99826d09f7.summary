to prove she was n't just an opportunist hoping to use a @entity3 seat in @entity4 as a ticket to bigger things , then - first lady @entity0 tried to show voters that she cared about their values and views -- she listened			0
more than a year before the 2000 election , @entity10 sat in farmhouses and in community centers , listening to voters ' needs and concerns and their problems with government			1
many liberal and progressive activists do n't trust @entity10 because they think she sides with big banks and big money instead of the middle class and they 're wary of her on national security			1
with a @entity10 presidential campaign a possibility , they want the same treatment @entity4 voters got			1
what would cause @entity10 not to run for president ? " if there was an actual , authentic ' i am going to listen to you about your issues ' from @entity10 , instead of kind of pounding the drum of inevitability and stampeding over the left on her way to assumed victory , that would be effective , " said @entity32 , a progressive activist , @entity34 contributor and @entity10 critic			1
until then , the trust deficit between @entity10 and the left of her party will grow , @entity32 and other liberals predict			1
activists point to @entity10 's voting record in the @entity3 , where she voted to authorize the @entity54 war and increase domestic surveillance			1
they say that and decisions her husband made while president , like the @entity60 and the authorization of the @entity62 , give her little street cred among liberals and populists			0
5 things we learned from @entity10 interview possibly the biggest concern among liberals is @entity10 's coziness with @entity72 , their big bogeyman			1
since leaving the @entity76 in 2013 , she has spoken at events sponsored by @entity72 giants like @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , and during her @entity3 runs and 2008 presidential run , @entity10 defended lobbyists			1
" i do n't think she has been aggressive on the banks , " said @entity85 , a progressive political organizer from @entity4			0
" when i think of @entity0 , i actually think she is in bed with some of the banks and @entity72 is her ally			0
" there is also an overarching suspicion among liberals that @entity10 is saying what she needs to get elected , but would govern differently			1
" you wonder if it is a pivot or whether she is saying what the moment demands , " @entity32 said			0
starting in may , before @entity10 crisscrossed the country selling her book " @entity105 , " the former secretary of state started to talk about populist and liberal issues like college affordability and income inequality			1
@entity106 : are @entity107 afraid of the income inequality issue ? @entity10 told an audience at the @entity110 in may that " the dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach " and because of that , " many @entity117 understandably feel frustrated , even angry			1
" @entity10 has also recently labeled college affordability " one of the biggest problems we have in the country , " and says if she were elected president she would " tackle growth , which is the handmaiden of inequality			1
" people close to her have started to trumpet her record on pay equity and the minimum wage			0
" she has come with a more populist tone because she knows what people want to hear , " @entity85 said			0
asked if she trusts @entity10 when she talks about income inequality , @entity85 said bluntly , " right now , not that much			1
" @entity10 would back limits on money in politics @entity10 's changing message has been overshadowed by gaffes during her book tour , like countering questions about her wealth by saying her family was " dead broke " when it left the @entity151			1
at the same time , possible opponents from the left -- like sen. @entity154 , @entity156 gov. @entity155 and vice president @entity157 -- have generated more buzz among liberals as alternatives to @entity10			1
other than changing her tune , @entity10 has n't been quick to address liberals who have questions for her			1
instead of sitting down with them -- something that a candidate would certainly do , especially one battling distrust -- she has continued to hold events around her book and her family 's foundation			0
polls might explain why she has n't reached out yet : right now , liberals do n't matter that much to whether @entity10 would win the @entity107 nomination in 2016			1
a @entity34 / @entity178 from june found that only 11 % of @entity107 want a more liberal option to @entity10			2
twenty percent want someone more conservative and 63 % want @entity10			2
what 's more , a @entity183 / @entity182 poll from the same time showed that 72 % of self - described liberals supported @entity10 , a number that was larger than moderate and conservative @entity107			1
but liberals do make a lot of noise			0
some of that has already boosted possible opponents from the left			0
earlier this month both @entity157 and @entity194 ignited the crowd of liberal bloggers and activists at the annual @entity199 conference in @entity200			0
@entity194 's speech was interrupted by chants of " @entity203 " from eager supporters who want to see her challenge @entity10 for the presidency			1
@entity10 was n't there , instead continuing with her " @entity105 " memoir tour in @entity211 , @entity212 , and @entity213 , @entity214			2
while @entity85 , who attended @entity199 , said there was n't an overarching feeling of being snubbed by @entity10 , she acknowledged , " it would have been interesting to hear her in a progressive setting			2
" " people want to hear from a potential candidate and have those candidates hear about the work they are doing on the ground , " she added			0
after the conference , left - leaning @entity107 said they felt more energized and organized than ever -- and they hope that will lead to more influence on who their party nominates in 2016			0
@entity232 calls @entity10 a ' 20th century ' candidate " she should n't be the inevitable candidate , " said @entity234 , the campaign manager for @entity235 , an effort to enlist @entity194 to run for president in 2016			2
" our take is that no one should feel like they ca n't support a candidate that they like or are excited about just because there is a lot of support for @entity0			0
" ready for @entity194 is a direct response to what many liberal organizers say is an assumption of inevitability among the cadre of groups and political operatives organizing for a possible @entity10 campaign			2
the name itself is a play on @entity262 , an organized group of @entity10 loyalists who have raised over $ 8 million to help @entity10 if she chooses to run in 2016			2
@entity234 , whose group received a great deal of attention at @entity199 this month , said it hopes to " channel the excitement about @entity194 into tangible results and a tangible organization			0
" but just as much as the group 's goal is to " elevate @entity194 , " as @entity234 said , progressives also want to direct the 2016 conversation			2
on this goal , progressives seem to be winning			0
@entity10 has talked more about populist issues since embarking on the book tour and will likely be forced to continue this rhetoric if she runs for president			2
and liberals hope their influence will grow with time			0
" there is this sort of inherent question , is @entity0 ready for us ? " @entity32 said about 2016			0
" it is not enough to just be the next in line			0
the question is : are you really , truly listening ? " @entity10 stands by ' @entity295 reset ' comments in the face of events			0

progressives see @entity10 as closer to the banks than to the middle class
@entity10 's record on national security also makes them wary
liberals like @entity154 and @entity155 are getting some buzz on the left
