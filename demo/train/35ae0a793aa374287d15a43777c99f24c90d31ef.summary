-- sir @entity1 is the retail king of @entity2 , but can his empire of clothing stores conquer the @entity5 ? the launch of his flagship @entity8 store in @entity9 was delayed and coincided with the height of recession two years ago , but the self - made billionaire still believes he can crack @entity5			1
" there 's nothing i have seen that tells me we ca n't get this brand to work in @entity5 , " says @entity1			1
@entity1 's @entity18 has over 2,500 outlets in the @entity20 , including affordable fashion chain , @entity8 , and employs over 44,000 staff			1
his transformation of @entity8 from cheap high street shop to a fashion - forward brand has grabbed the attention of supermodels , fashionistas and the queen of fashion , @entity5 @entity31 editor - in - chief , @entity32			1
a good combination to grow a brand in the @entity5 " @entity1 has a larger than life personality ... ( @entity36 ) has been very successful in attracting attention for @entity8 , " says @entity32			1
" asking @entity38 to design a collection that really put the spotlight on @entity8 in a way that had n't before , so that was a very smart move			0
" the supermodel is no - longer connected to the brand , but the @entity9 store has weathered the recession and built up the brand despite some misgivings from @entity1 himself			2
" being honest , would i rather be a hundred meters further north in @entity50 ? yes , i would , " he says			0
" is it the furthest south a retailer has taken on that 's never traded in @entity5 ? did we take a site that was horrid , did it have risk in terms of where it is , how far down soho it is , getting people to come down there ? " they may be rhetorical questions , but despite the calculated risks @entity1 and his @entity18 remains an emerging player in the @entity5 retail scene where so many @entity20 companies have tried and failed before : a common joke in the rag - trade says that the only way to make a small fortune in @entity5 is start with a large fortune			1
" it is a bit of a gamble because it 's such a sophisticated market , but the risks are worth the rewards , " says @entity75 from @entity76			0
" the @entity5 is still the largest retail market in the world			0
" @entity75 cites the lack of brand awareness , too rapid expansion and badly thought out partnerships with @entity5 chains as typical reasons why @entity20 and other foreign brands have failed to make much of a dent in the @entity5 last year profits of @entity18 were more than healthy -- around $ 440 million in 2010 -- but faced with the @entity5 market , " we are a pimple in terms of one brand , in terms of scale , of what the size of the opportunity could be , " @entity1 says			1
" naturally if we want to build a global business , we have got to develop so i think from an investment strategy , from size of the marketplace , from what i think we need to do with the brand , ( we need ) to move the needle as they say			0
" doubling the size of @entity8 sounds a big ask , he says , but " there 's good acceptance of the product , there 's good acceptance of the brand , there 's work to do but i think we 've got a shot			2
" opening new stores in other big cosmopolitan cities in the @entity5 is the immediate plan ; one that @entity32 believes would be successful			2
" the @entity5 retail market is different from the @entity20 one , " she says			2
" @entity1 does n't take unnecessary risk but with everything being so positive in the @entity5 and the economy picking up , i 'm really hopeful that he 'll expand across the country			0
" @entity5 is a more casual country ( than the @entity20 )			0
you go outside of the more fashionable cities you tend to see a lot of jeans and sweatshirts , it 's less responsive to what @entity8 stands for			0
" i 'm confident that with @entity1 's expertise he will conquer the @entity5 the way that he has conquered @entity2			1

@entity20 retail billionaire sir @entity1 aims to make his fashion brand big in the @entity5
editor - in - chief of @entity31 thinks @entity1 will be successful where many others have failed
@entity1 's @entity8 has a flagship store in @entity145 with expansion plans to other @entity5 cities
