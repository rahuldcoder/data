-- the @entity1 of december 8 produced a curious mixture of cohesion and disagreement			1
cohesion was apparent among the eurozone countries ( and a number of other countries ) which all accepted the essence of the @entity11 - @entity10 proposal to make the limits on economic policy even more legally binding , now called officially a " fiscal compact			1
" on the substance the new fiscal compact is a case of " now we really mean it			1
" in the old @entity21 , member countries had already solemnly declared their commitment to achieve a balanced budget over the cycle			1
but this was never achieved ; and when both @entity11 and @entity10 had deficits exceeding 3 % of gdp in the early 2000s they simply cobbled together a majority to change the interpretation of the @entity21 to allow them to avoid fines			1
under the new fiscal compact this should no longer be possible			1
member countries from now have to observe a limit on their cyclically adjusted fiscal deficits of 0.5 % of gdp			1
this number is almost exactly the same as the new constitutional rule @entity10 adopted recently			1
all member countries have undertaken to enshrine this rule in their constitutions and submit control of it to the @entity45			2
how to get to this lofty goal was left open			2
on current projections only two member countries will actually satisfy the limit of the euro fiscal compact : @entity10 and @entity51			2
given that @entity51 is now the biggest headache for the eurozone , this may seem surprising -- @entity51 does not have a deficit problem			1
the problem of @entity51 is its high debt level , or rather the need to roll over large amounts of debt coming due at acceptable rates			2
the fiscal compact will do little to alleviate this problem			2
most other member countries , especially @entity11 , will have to undertake a major fiscal adjustment if they are to adhere to the limits of the new fiscal compact			1
it remains to be seen how the @entity11 parliament will react when this becomes more widely appreciated			2
the new fiscal compact is certainly not needed to deal with the acute crisis at hand			0
at present there is no need for fines or interventions by the @entity45 to force countries bring their budget in order			0
the pressure from financial markets is already so strong that @entity51 has already implemented changes that more than satisfy the new limit given			0
the country is on course to achieve fiscal balance in two years			0
the true significance of this agreement in the short run is that it might provide political comfort for the @entity10 government			0
@entity92 can now claim to the @entity10 public that the financial support @entity10 has given to the periphery will not be wasted because these countries have accepted a permanent fiscal straight jacket			0
the @entity11 and @entity10 leaders felt vindicated by the fact that their proposal had been accepted not only all euro area countries but also a number of other @entity104 member countries			0
the disagreement with the @entity106 was not about the substance of this fiscal compact , which would anyway have no implications for the @entity106 government , nor for the @entity106 economy			0
the opposition of the @entity106 did not allow the euro states to make full use of the @entity104 framework			0
this is why a new , intergovernmental treaty , will now have to be negotiated			0
this can actually be done quicker than a full - fledged revision of the @entity120 , which requires an elaborate and time - consuming procedure			0
if the new limits on deficits really are adhered to , last week 's agreement will signal a fundamental change			1
fiscal policy would be mostly on automatic pilot and debt levels should decline continuously			0
it remains to be seen whether national parliaments will fully swallow this loss of sovereignty			0
if credible this fiscal compact should lead to a massive improvement in the rating of sovereign debt in the euro area			0
a first test might come soon , when the ratings agencies have to decide whether to follow through on downgrade warnings issued before the summit			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144			1

@entity144 is the *director* of the @entity146 in @entity147
*advised* committee which developed original plans for the @entity151
if members adhere to deficit limits , new pact signals ' fundamental change '
@entity158 could soon come if ratings agencies follow through on credit warnings
