-- vice president @entity1 made some waves last week when he announced that he was still thinking about running for the presidency in 2016			1
appearing on " @entity4 , " @entity1 said , " my knowledge of foreign policy , my engagement of world leaders , my experience uniquely positions me to follow through on the agenda @entity11 and i have of bringing world peace that is real and substantive			2
" most experts are predicting that former secretary of state @entity14 will be the " inevitable nominee " for the @entity15 in 2016 -- with over 80 % of @entity15 saying they want @entity16 to run , and only 42 % saying the same about @entity1 , according to a @entity19 / @entity18 poll			1
but the vice president is refusing to give up this dream and still considering the possibility that he will try to succeed president @entity23			1
although @entity1 's shortcomings are well known , such as his proclivity toward gaffes -- in 2007 , he said of his then - opponent @entity23 , " i mean , you got the first mainstream @entity34 who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice - looking guy , " and on another occasion he said that " jobs " was a three - letter word -- he also brings many assets to the table , including his knowledge of foreign policy and popularity among working - and middle - class @entity15 who appreciate his defense of government programs that benefit them			1
@entity1 has also been willing to take a much stronger tack against the @entity45 than @entity23 has			2
" this is not your father 's @entity45 , " he said to one group of @entity15			0
many also consider him the most genuinely human of the potential candidates			0
but even if @entity14 does n't run , @entity1 would face long odds to succeed			1
the record of vice presidents who won election to succeed their predecessors has been meager			1
after @entity56 , @entity57 , and @entity58 , the only other vice president to win the election after his president stepped down , was @entity45 @entity61 in 1988 ( or in the case of @entity57 , to defeat the president under whom he served )			1
the others who have taken on this challenge since @entity66 -- @entity67 in 1960 , @entity68 in 1968 , and @entity69 in 2000 ( though some say that he did indeed win the election ) -- have not fared well			0
while 14 former vice presidents have become president , nine of those took office as a result of the death of their predecessor and then went on to win the election ( such as @entity80 )			1
@entity67 was elected president in 1968 , but that was seven years after leaving the vice presidency in 1961 and after carefully rebuilding his image as a party statesman			1
why is it so hard for vice presidents ? the biggest liability is that they are running at a time when their predecessor has usually become most controversial			1
@entity68 , once the darling of the @entity15 base , was bogged down by @entity80 's record in @entity95 when he ran in 1968			0
even when departing presidents have strong approval ratings , their decisions in the @entity98 have created many issues and earned many enemies			2
the luster of the early years that an administration enjoys in the @entity98 has worn out			0
supporters of the opposition party usually hate everything associated with the incumbent , while there are often huge tensions within the president 's party as well			1
" i have a f * * king target on my back , " @entity113 reported @entity1 told a confidant in 2012 , referring to @entity15 who were upset with him about the 2012 budget deal			0
it is relatively easy for an opponent -- like @entity121 in 1960 when he beat vice president @entity67 -- to present himself as the fresh voice in politics , in contrast to a tired and potentially worn - out face			2
vice presidents are rarely comfortable as candidates running on their own and relating to their predecessor			1
on the one hand , they want to derive the benefits from everything that @entity131 like about the president			0
yet , as was the case with @entity69 , they want to be their own person and separate themselves from the baggage that comes with the existing @entity98			0
the result is that vice presidents running for the presidency flip back and forth on how much they want to attach themselves to the president , never achieving a level of comfort that their opponents can claim			1
in the @entity148 era , railing against @entity146 is always in fashion , and vice presidents are often the victim			2
other than a president himself , nothing symbolizes the establishment more than the person who is second in command			0
a vice president who runs for office offers a perfect foil to members of his or her own party , as well as to the opposition party , to paint the race as a contest between @entity146 and those who want to change @entity146			1
this is true even if the opponent is also a member of the political class			0
nothing would be more helpful to @entity14 than having @entity1 run in the primaries , because it would allow her to distance herself from the capital -- even though she served in @entity146 as first lady for eight years , senator for eight years and secretary of state for four			2
finally , the vice president simply does not get the same credit for achievements that presidents enjoy			1
even in an age when vice presidents have become much more powerful and enjoy a substantial amount of autonomy during their time in the @entity98 , the public does n't really see them as central figures in the political debate			2
they often work behind the scenes , pushing policy in one direction or another outside the public eye			0
other than @entity1 's famous statement on gay rights , where he got ahead of the president in announcing his support for same - sex marriage , most @entity131 are unaware of what he is doing , including work on economic policy and the war in @entity200			1
the only modern exception to this pattern was @entity61 , who was able to score a healthy victory in 1988			0
he did not face a strong primary challenger -- sen. @entity205 did not have great public appeal , and the preacher @entity207 veered so far to the right on cultural issues he set up @entity61 perfectly as the candidate of the center			0
democrat @entity213 ' candidacy imploded in the fall with a weak campaign , while the dramatic changes that would ultimately lead to the disintegration of the @entity218 and the ending of the @entity220 created a bias toward stability and continuity in foreign policy			0
perhaps most importantly , @entity61 conducted a slash - and - burn campaign under the direction of @entity227 that helped win him the election			0
so while @entity1 has a considerable amount of experience and what many might consider an impressive record , the odds of his winning in 2016 are slim			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			0

vice president @entity1 said he 's thinking of running for the presidency in 2016
many democrats say they want @entity14 to be their party 's nominee
@entity236 says vice presidents rarely win elections to succeed their presidents
@entity236 : vice presidents carry a lot of baggage , *inheriting* opposition and enemies
