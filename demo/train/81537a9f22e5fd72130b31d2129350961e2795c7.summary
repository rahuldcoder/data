@entity0 , @entity1 -- if an unexpected fourth place at the @entity4 two weeks ago had given @entity6 's rivals cause for hope , sunday at @entity8 's @entity0 served as a reminder that his talents run deep			1
this was @entity6 at his imperious best , as well as a fine advertisement for a sport that thrives on white - knuckle tension ; in a scintillating contest , @entity4 's youngest ever champion roared back to form			1
his victory means only a disaster for the 21 - year - old @entity20 can prevent him lifting his second title well before the end of the season			0
@entity25 's record - breaking star began on pole after a typically impressive qualifying session , but quickly found himself playing catch - up to an apparently rejuvenated @entity29			1
the @entity31 rider seized his chance in warmer than expected conditions , taking an early lead as a fierce skirmish developed behind him			1
@entity38 's @entity37 had gatecrashed the @entity25 - @entity31 power party on the starting grid , and the @entity41 took his increasing confidence into battle with @entity44 and @entity45			1
gradually the front five eased away from the chasing pack , but remained close enough to one another to throw up some heart stopping moments as positions changed lap after lap. the contest reached an electrifying climax in the final moments , with @entity6 and @entity29 diving into an uncompromising dogfight			1
when @entity29 seized the initiative with just three laps remaining it looked as though the man from @entity62 might be able to hold on for the win			1
the two riders knocked fairings as their battle raged , before an audacious and fearless pass from @entity6 fired the championship leader back to the front with two laps remaining			1
the champion held his lead to cross the line to claim his 11th victory from the 12 @entity75 this season			2
@entity6 was delighted with the win , having missed out to @entity29 at @entity0 last year			1
" with higher temperatures it seems that both @entity29 and @entity45 took a step forward , " he said			1
" above all , @entity29 , because he had a great pace and we were fighting right to the end			1
" it was important to win , after missing out at @entity86			2
i also had a score to settle from last year , when @entity29 beat me on the final corner , so i am happy to be back on the top step of the podium ! " @entity29 , meanwhile , revealed that he had struggled to maintain the same pace as his rival , and blamed their coming together for the loss of valuable momentum			1
" i lost a lot of time when he ( @entity6 ) touched me , " he said			2
" i knew that he was going to try to overtake me in this corner in first gear on the right , but i did n't let him enter			0
" on the outside i opened the throttle and he touched me			0
in the next corner he touched me again as he went into the corner and i lost seven tenths of a second			0
" even so @entity29 was pleased with his second place			2
" i made a really good start and pushed 100 % , more than ever , so i am really proud of my riding , " he said			2
@entity45 -- who set a new outright record of 246 starts in the premier class of @entity75 racing -- won the battle behind the leaders to take third from @entity44 and a disappointed but philosophical @entity37			2
" the result confirms the improvements we are making , " the @entity41 said			0
" finishing the race less than ten seconds behind the leaders was almost a dream before the start , but instead we did it and we were always in with a fighting chance of finishing on the podium			0
" the home fans were left frustrated as one of their favorites , @entity129 's @entity127 , was knocked out of contention by a cracked rear wheel			2
the @entity133 's tyre deflated as a result , forcing him into the pits			0
when he re-joined with a new wheel his chances of a point - scoring finish had gone , but he did manage to ride to within a lap of the leaders , to loud cheers from the stands			0
" i tried to stay out and fight through it but it just got too dangerous to ride , " @entity127 said			0
" when we changed ( the wheel ) , i proved that i have the pace for sixth			0
it was a good weekend up until the race and the team did a great job , but these things happen sometimes			0
" @entity129 could , however , console themselves with an outstanding performance from rookie @entity155 , who forced his way into a highly creditable sixth position			0
of the other top @entity8 talent , @entity158 piloted his @entity160 to a solid tenth , but @entity38 's @entity162 could only manage twelfth			0
the talented @entity164 - born rider must surely be counting the days until he leaves for his new team , @entity165 , at the end of an intensely trying season			0
the championship now takes a two week break before the @entity170 , with @entity6 a titanic 89 points clear of @entity44 , and @entity45 a further 10 points back in third , with only six races remaining this season .			1
