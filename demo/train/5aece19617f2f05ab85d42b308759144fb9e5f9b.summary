on the southern edge of @entity1 , rolling brown pastoral hills slope gently to the @entity4 border , with small towns like this one dotting the horizon			0
the calm on this side of the border , however , belies the scene on the other side			0
just across the border in northern @entity4 , the @entity13 extremist group known as @entity14 is fighting a full - tilt battle in its effort to capture and control new territory , part of its push to create a sprawling @entity13 caliphate , or separate @entity13 state , modeled on the first caliphate that spread across the region in the centuries following the death of the @entity27 around 640 ad			1
as @entity14 fighters expand their control , it is in the border region , in villages like @entity33 , where the @entity34 can make some of the money it needs to finance its wars			2
oil - smuggling operations involving millions of barrels have recently been uncovered			2
the oil comes from wells and refineries that @entity14 has taken over inside northern @entity43 and northern @entity4 , and until very recently it was easy to smuggle it into this quiet part of southern @entity1			2
one reason is that cheap , smuggled oil is a much - prized commodity in @entity1 , where oil is so expensive that it almost does n't matter who is selling it , even if it 's your enemy			1
in @entity55 , @entity1 , just a half hour 's drive away , gasoline costs roughly $ 7.50 per gallon			2
growing international alarm over @entity14 expansion and the group 's increasingly visible atrocities -- such as beheadings of @entity63 journalists and aid workers , the videos of which are disseminated online -- have brought renewed pressure on @entity14 and its funding methods on the borders			1
@entity71 - led coalition forces just a week ago attacked and destroyed many @entity14 oil facilities , precisely to cut off the group 's funding			1
but the border smuggling is only one way that @entity14 generates money			1
the @entity78 does not have hard figures that it can make public on the group 's wealth but says it believes @entity14 takes in millions of dollars a month			1
sources familiar with the subject say that @entity14 ' " burn ' rate " -- how much the group spends -- is huge , including salaries , weapons and other expenses			1
for @entity14 ' oil sales , sources told @entity90 , the group probably makes between $ 1 million and $ 2 million per day , but probably on the lower end			1
@entity92 , director of the @entity93 on @entity94 at the @entity95 in @entity96 , calls @entity14 " the best - financed group we 've ever seen			1
" opinion : will @entity71 strikes hurt @entity14 ' oil riches ? @entity92 is a national expert on terrorism and its financing , working previously on intelligence and analysis at the @entity78 and the @entity107			1
@entity14 , @entity92 says , is funded like no other traditional terrorist group in the past			2
besides revenue from oil smuggling , the group receives money through donations from wealthy sympathizers in countries including @entity117 and @entity118			1
but the group has another method of funding itself : through organized crime within the territories it has vanquished and now controls			1
the group , says @entity92 , was born among crooks and thugs from a broken @entity43 , and at its root it is a criminal enterprise			0
" we should n't be surprised , " says @entity92			0
" remember , the @entity127 called @entity14 is what used to be called the @entity14 , and @entity129 in @entity43 , the @entity130 , the @entity14 ; it 's all the same			2
and they were always primarily financed through domestic criminal activity within the borders of @entity43			0
" @entity92 says @entity14 operates as a massive organized crime group with virtually no law enforcement to rein it in -- and its long history has allowed it to set roots and develop over many years			1
it means @entity14 can demand money from people wherever it has established control			2
want to do business in @entity14 - controlled territory ? you pay a tax			2
want to move a truck down an @entity14 - controlled highway ? you pay a toll			2
villagers in @entity14 territory reportedly are charged and pay for just about everything			0
why is @entity14 so successful at luring @entity63 ? " there are reports that people in @entity154 ( @entity43 ) who want to take money out of their own bank accounts need to make a ' voluntary ' -- not so voluntary -- donation to the @entity127 , to @entity14 , " @entity92 says			0
" so controlling territory has given them opportunities that other groups like @entity129 , who have n't controlled real territory , have n't had			0
" it is the centuries - honored tradition of conquest and control : what you take is what you have			0
in @entity154 , @entity14 looted the central bank and other smaller provincial banks , resulting in a financial windfall of tens and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars			0
@entity14 formed in the void created by the pullout of @entity71 troops and the retreating @entity43 army , says @entity178 , the executive director of the @entity179 in @entity96			1
in the lawlessness that followed , he says , @entity14 took over , robbed banks , began taxing and extorting the population , and now funds its war and expansion across @entity43 and @entity4 almost independently			0
@entity178 lobbies @entity71 lawmakers for more support of moderate @entity4 rebels who are now fighting both @entity14 and the @entity4 regime of @entity190			1
he recently helped bring together several @entity192 delegations to meet with moderate rebel groups on the border as part of that effort			0
coalition airstrikes , he says , are n't enough to destroy the kind of self - financing mob that @entity14 has become			1
instead , you need to take back the territory and restore civil order			0
" they 're taxing the people ; that 's a huge revenue , " he says of @entity14			1
" but not only that			0
they also control sort of the breadbasket of @entity4 , in terms of @entity210 ( their defacto capital )			0
they 've got the cotton and the wheat and all these other things			0
all of these serve as sort of economic and powerhouse or funding for @entity14			2
" fighters who are willing to do battle against @entity14 are frustrated that the @entity71 has not helped them more , @entity178 says , pointing out that it is largely a decision for the @entity71 president			1
" it is a @entity228 decision , " @entity178 said			0
" and it always has been			0
and i think the @entity228 is slowly moving in the right direction			0
i can tell you that the policy that the @entity228 has right now -- if it had this policy three years ago , there would have never been an @entity14 , and we probably would have gotten rid of the @entity190 regime			0
" the @entity237 administration has heard this criticism before and counters that the president has been calculating in his response to the situation in @entity4			0
" it 's not difficult to contemplate or imagine a scenario where if the @entity71 had put -- dumped a bunch of arms into that country three years ago , that members of @entity14 or other extremist groups would be toting @entity71 arms as they wage their campaign of violence throughout that region , " @entity228 press secretary @entity242 said last month , referring to @entity14 by another acronym			1
" so the president has been very deliberate about this			0
" @entity71 - led coalition airstrikes have recently begun targeting @entity14 locations , attacking @entity14 - controlled oil facilities and even grain silos			1
but as long as @entity14 controls any ground where civilians can be taxed , extorted and robbed , say experts , @entity14 will remain self - financing			1
@entity14 : everything you need to know about the rise of the militant group			2

@entity14 makes around $ 1 million a day , sources say
oil smuggling is n't the only way it generates revenue
experts : @entity14 is like organized crime , with deep roots and no law enforcement
@entity71 - led airstrikes are aimed at cutting off the group 's funding
