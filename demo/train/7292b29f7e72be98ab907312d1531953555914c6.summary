@entity9 ' win leaves only thursday 's nominating contest in @entity34 , where incumbent @entity35 faces a bunch of conservative challengers , for a tea party - backed candidate to prevail in @entity1 primaries			1
@entity11 's campaign for months tried to portray @entity9 as more in tune with @entity43 than @entity2 , pointing to reports from earlier this year that the senator listed his voting address at the home of two longtime political supporters who rent a room to him			1

dueling controversies the @entity11 campaign ran numerous ads attacking @entity9 over his residency			1
at the same time , the @entity9 ' campaign over the past couple of months went up with tv ads reminding voters that @entity11 , a radiologist , posted x-ray images of mortal injuries and made light of them and the victims			1
@entity11 was later forced to admit he made " insensitive " comments			2
@entity11 painted himself as a conservative activist with the guts to stand up to the @entity1 establishment			1
as a doctor , he frequently campaigned against the @entity90 and proposed his own plan that he calls " @entity92			0
" he enjoyed the backing and the support of some major national tea party groups , such as the @entity96 and the @entity97 , and some influential anti-establishment organizations , like the @entity99 and the @entity100			1
@entity9 enjoyed the support of the @entity102 , which is chaired by fellow @entity2 @entity103 sen. @entity103			1
showdown on the street in the closing weeks of the primary campaign , @entity11 highlighted what he said was @entity108 's refusal to debate him			2
last week , @entity11 changed his travel plans at the last minute to confront @entity9 as he met with business leaders in @entity111 , @entity2			1
" you told @entity113 you would give them your word and you would give them a debate , " @entity11 said to @entity9			1

you tell us that you are tough and you 're tested and trusted			0
and i want you to keep your word on that , i want you to debate			0
i think @entity113 deserve it			0
" " @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , " @entity9 said dismissively			2
" this is not the time			0
we have a regularly - scheduled event , a listening tour event			2
this is not the time			0
" " when would be the time , senator , because i 'll go anywhere you 'd like			0
you 've given your word to debate			0
let 's just debate , " @entity11 continued as @entity9 walked off			1
@entity9 ' campaign was asked why he would n't debate			2
" the question 's not about debating			0
the question is about an immature candidate with a desperate campaign , an unethical candidate pulling stunts like he did today			2
when you 're 20 points down , these are the kind of desperate stunts you pull , " spokesman @entity144 said			0
2014 tea party challenges the primary in @entity2 comes six weeks after longtime sen. @entity153 of @entity154 narrowly won re-nomination , edging out tea party - backed state sen. @entity156 in a runoff			1
@entity156 officially contested the results of the june primary runoff on monday after revealing alleged evidence of voter fraud and irregularities			0

challenger @entity194 , a businessman who has support from the @entity197 , tried to unseat two - term rep. @entity198 , a libertarian who won his seat in the 2010 tea party wave that landed @entity7 in the @entity203 majority			1
but despite being outspent , @entity198 staved off his establishment - backed challenger			1
