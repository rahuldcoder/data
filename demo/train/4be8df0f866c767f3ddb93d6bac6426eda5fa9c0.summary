inside one of the many busy open markets in @entity5 , rows of hanged trousers and dresses swing in midair , casting a shadow over the colorful stacks of unsorted clothes sitting on rickety wooden stalls			0
amidst the hustle and bustle , bargain - hunting shoppers rummage through the large piles of printed t - shirts , short - sleeved blouses and retro jackets in search of a great deal			0
this is the @entity22 capital 's version of a thrift store , fully stocked with second - hand garments from the @entity25			1
here , @entity30 - made clothing , @entity29 sports jerseys and designer labels are all offered at discount prices , turning second - hand markets like this into a prime destination for cheap garments			1
" things from @entity40 and @entity41 , @entity42 , they are nice , " says @entity36 , owner of a local second - hand market stall			1
" my customers keep on coming			0
" short - term gain , long - term pain ? the sale of @entity48 cast - offs starts with charities in @entity30 and @entity29 countries that earn money by offloading donated clothes they can not find buyers for			1
the unwanted used clothes often end up in landfills			0
increasingly , however , they are also being purchased by wholesalers , who then sort , label and package them into containers for export to different markets			0
a large portion of these previously owned clothes ends up in market stalls across @entity69 -- according to an @entity71 report , used garments account for over 50 % of the clothing sector by volume in many @entity75 countries			1
for customers in @entity5 's bustling markets , however , this is no dumping ground			0
instead , these clothes are as desirable as they are affordable			0
" yes , the price is right and the clothes are still looking good , " says @entity80 , a local shopper			2
in the beginning , it appears to be a win - win situation for everyone involved ; @entity48 charities receive much - needed revenue , @entity75 buyers with weak purchasing power get low - priced , well - made clothing , and merchants find eager customers for their merchandise			2
but some experts say that the mass influx of cheap hand - me - downs from the @entity25 could have a much more negative impact			1
" the long - term effect is that countries such as @entity109 or @entity110 or @entity111 ca n't really establish or protect their own clothing industries if they are importing second - hand goods , " says @entity99 , lecturer at @entity100 and co-author of a study called " unravelling the @entity103 between @entity104 and the decline of @entity106			1
" " your t - shirt may be quite cheap for someone to buy , but it would be better if that person could buy a locally manufactured t - shirt , so the money stays within the economy and that helps generate jobs , " he adds			0
watch video : cashing in on second - hand clothes big business analysts say textile industries are relatively easy to develop and , as success stories like @entity130 showcase , can provide the first step in the ladder towards economic growth			1
a booming clothing sector is labor intensive , generates national revenues through taxes and , ultimately , can help end dependency on aid			0
but in @entity69 , the introduction of trade - liberalization policies and the opening of economies in the 1980s and 1990 allowed both second - hand and cheap new imports , especially from @entity147 countries , to enter markets across the continent			1
this undermined growth opportunities for many local industries and led to the closure of several @entity75 clothing factories , say experts			1
according to a 2006 report , textile and clothing employment in @entity158 declined by 80 % from 1975 to 2000 ; in @entity111 it fell from 25,000 workers in the 1980s to below 10,000 in 2002 ; and in @entity163 the number of workers fell from 200,000 to being insignificant			0
meanwhile , second - hand became a highly lucrative industry across @entity75 markets			1
whilst exact continent - wide figures are hard to come by , global used clothing exports from @entity169 countries stood at $ 1.9 billion in 2009 , according to 2011 @entity173 data			2
yet @entity99 claims the figure is an underestimation , largely because of the widespread smuggling of used clothes that occurs in many countries , as well as trans - shipments that are not documented in official statistics			2
" the best estimate that probably gives the value of the global trade of second - hand clothing would be about $ 3 billion , " he says			2
" obviously , that 's the import cost and once things are sold on retail , [ it 's ] probably twice that , " he adds			0

designer @entity198 , who 's been in business in @entity5 for more than a decade , says it 's very difficult to rival the second - hand market			2
" probably 90 % of the clothing people are buying in the whole country are second - hand clothes , " says @entity198			1
" it 's a multimillion dollar industry -- so , as a small fish , how are you going to start to compete with that ? " to deal with the problem , a number of @entity75 countries have banned imports of second - hand clothes in recent years as part of efforts aimed at protecting their national textiles industries			1
amongst them are the continent 's two biggest economies -- @entity69 and @entity163 -- while many more are also debating restrictions			0
but there 's also another threat to the local industries : @entity224 imports that are even cheaper than the @entity48 hand - me - downs and locally made clothes			1
read this : ' @entity224 can transform @entity69 ' " one of the problems is that these local clothing industries are often more expensive than clothing that 's produced in @entity147 , " says @entity99			2
" so if you ban second - hand clothing sometimes this gets replaced with imports of clothing from @entity224 or elsewhere in the @entity237			1
" back in @entity240 's shop , the designer says she is resigned to the reality of her competition			0
she adds , however , that she looks forward to the day that homegrown businesses like her own prevail			0
" as much as i do n't like second - hand clothes to be in the market , i do n't have an alternative , " she says			1
" i can not make enough clothes to support a population of 33 million			0
so we need to actually first grow the manufacturing and production side of the business locally for us to say , ' ok , all the other stuff ca n't come in			0
' " @entity99 says that whilst used t - shirts , jeans and dresses can satisfy a basic need for affordable clothing , they ultimately help keep people in poverty			0
" second - hand clothing maintains the status quo , " he says			2
" it does n't help the poor get richer , it just keeps things as they are at the moment			0

previously owned clothing is big business in @entity69
but mass influx of second - hand clothes from the @entity25 damages local industries
designers say cast - offs are preventing their businesses from growing
several @entity75 countries have banned imports of second - hand clothes
