@entity0 -- questions were raised friday over the training of the pilots on the doomed @entity5 , after analysis of the plane 's voice and data recorders by a @entity11 investigation body			1
the recorders from the plane , which plunged into the @entity14 in june 2009 on its way from @entity16 to @entity11 with the loss of 228 passengers and crew , were recovered in may , after almost two years on the sea bed			1
the data they provided has shed new light on the final minutes of the flight , @entity11 's @entity21 , the @entity21 , said as it issued its third report			1
the crisis arose after a problem involving blocked pitot tubes -- devices that measure a plane 's air speed -- which led to the disconnection of the autopilot , it said			1
the recorders revealed the pilots had failed to discuss repeated stall warnings and " had received no high altitude training " to deal with the situation , the @entity21 said			1
the pilots got conflicting air speed readings in the minutes leading up to the crash and , after the stall , responded by pointing the nose upward , rather than downward , to recover			1
they failed to regain control of the aircraft and no announcement was made to the passengers before it plummeted from the sky			0
the descent from 38,000 feet took 3 minutes and 30 seconds			0
@entity51 defended the pilots ' performance , saying there was " no reason to question the crew 's technical skills " in the face of " multiple improbable factors			1
" but an aviation expert questioned why the pilots did not correct the stall			1
" dealing with a stall situation is a fundamental part of being a pilot -- if you take private flying lessons , it is one of the things they teach you within the first few hours , " said @entity63 , an editor at @entity64			0
" nobody seems to understand yet why they could n't get out of the stall , why the pilots were unable to apply what -- in hindsight -- seems to be a fairly straightforward procedure , " he said			2
the @entity21 issued 10 new safety recommendations , including ensuring extra training for pilots on manual handling of a high - altitude stall , such as that experienced by @entity5 , and asking regulatory authorities to require airlines to equip planes with an image recorder to show what is displayed on the pilots ' whole instrument panel			2
the @entity21 also recommends that the triggering of location transmitters and a video recorder should be mandatory when an emergency is detected on board an aircraft			0
@entity1 's aviation correspondent @entity99 said the report " shows that the original incident -- the blocked pitot tubes and failed speed sensor -- was serious but not catastrophic			1
" " it should have been relatively straightforward to deal with for an experienced flight crew			2
however , it was the response of the pilots which ultimately doomed the aircraft , " he said			0
" by focusing the attention on the way the cockpit crew handled the emergency , the @entity21 is recommending further training for pilots in dealing with high - altitude crises			2
" sources in the industry tell me that this incident , among others , is leading to a rethink and renewed emphasis on piloting skills			0
" @entity63 said modern - day planes are capable of flying themselves most of the time , which means pilots have to be capable computer managers			0
" the danger of this is that when things start going wrong , is the pilot still in the loop ? " @entity63 said			0
" the computer might recognize what 's wrong , but if the pilot does n't , how will he get out of it ? @entity11 transport minister @entity140 told @entity11 radio network @entity141 that the @entity21 was responsible for establishing " the facts " and that it would be the courts ' role to assign any blame			1
@entity51 and @entity147 are being investigated for alleged involuntary manslaughter over the crash			1
in its response to the report , @entity51 said the two co-pilots and the captain " showed an unfailing professional attitude , remaining committed to their task to the very end			1
@entity51 pays tribute to the courage and determination they showed in such extreme conditions			2
" it went on : " from the flight recorder data , it has been established that the combination of multiple improbable factors led to the disaster in less than four minutes : the icing of the pitot probes was the initial event that led to the disconnection of the autopilot , the loss of associated piloting control protections and considerable roll movements			0
" after the manoeuvres carried out by the crew in deteriorated and destabilizing piloting conditions , the aircraft stalled at high altitude , could not be recovered and struck the surface of the @entity14 at high speed			2
" all 228 people aboard the @entity183 from @entity184 to @entity0 were killed in the crash			0
the bulk of the wreckage was found earlier this year after a search by robot submarines of an underwater mountain range			0
more than 150 bodies have been brought up from the scene of the crash , but more than 70 will never be recovered			0
@entity1 's @entity194 and @entity195 contributed to this report .			0

new : an aviation expert wonders why the pilots were not able to deal with the stall
the @entity11 report follows an analysis of data from the plane 's recorders
@entity51 says there is no reason to question the abilities of its crew
the recorders were retrieved from the @entity14 almost two years after the crash
