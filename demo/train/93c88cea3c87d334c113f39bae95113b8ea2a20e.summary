-- when news broke that six e-mail accounts belonging to members of the @entity6 family were hacked and some of the contents posted online , reactions ranged from being offended to amusement			1
many people objected to the leak of family exchanges reflecting contingency planning for the funeral of president @entity6			0
if ever a family deserves privacy , it is when dealing with the death , or impending death , of a loved one			2
others seized on the semi-nude bathing self - portraits of president @entity22 to resume ridicule not seen since he left office			2
and virtually everyone took the episode as a warning that " this can happen to you			0
" the @entity15 email hack comes on the heels of reports of hacking at universities and major newspapers , and it follows urgent government warnings against our fragile cybersecurity defenses			1
so , do the average users of online e-mail and web services simply have to assume that hacking will expose their personal messages and photos ? not necessarily			1
the recent spate of security breaches and the attention focused on them will mean that government and businesses will up their game even more to secure our information infrastructure			2
but the security reinforcement might take time			0
in the meantime , people have options to protect their information and themselves			1
privacy and data security is a shared responsibility , after all , and users have a role to play			1
some web - based e-mail services like @entity67 's @entity66 offer tools to add an extra layer of protection			2
@entity66 offers a two - step verification to add an extra layer of security			1
such protection erects a double gate against unwanted interception			0
through two - step verification , in addition to user name and password , you enter a code that the e-mail provider will send via text , voice call or on a mobile app. two - step verification drastically reduces the chances of someone stealing the personal information from your e-mail account because hackers would have to not only get a password and your user name , they would also have to have access to the mobile phone to which the code is sent			1
and while you are taking steps to secure your e-mail , you would be well - advised to make sure your @entity101 connection is secure			1
wireless routers are ubiquitous , allowing you to share your internet connection and files around the house			0
but without securing your router , anyone within range can access the websites you visit and may be able to access your personal information			0
securing your @entity101 router with a password is an easy step to take , and it is often overlooked			1
if you want to get a little more technical , take a look at whether the website you are using to transmit information is using @entity117 -- hypertext transfer protocol secure			0
@entity117 encrypts your data so that it can not be intercepted during transmission			0
you will find that your banking transactions almost always will be conducted through the @entity117 protocol			0
for an extra level of security , check to see if other websites you use offer @entity117 for transmission			0
so instead of throwing up your hands that web - based e-mail and online data transfers can never be secure , seek out and use the security tools that already exist			1
and no matter what your political persuasion , thank the @entity6 family for the wake - up call			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity137 .			2
