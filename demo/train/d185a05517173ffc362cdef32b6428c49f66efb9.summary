-- i spent much of sunday in touch with a group of fellow researchers			2
like myself , they are college professors who are interested in understanding how people respond to weather and climate			1
when we recognized last week that @entity11 was likely to make landfall rather than turning out to sea , we decided to conduct a telephone survey			1
on friday , we began asking @entity16 residents how likely they thought the storm was to strike , how dangerous it would be , and what steps they were taking to protect themselves from the storm			1
we are curious to see how well they could sort out the multiple threats -- wind , storm surge , heavy rain			1
we will not know the full results of our work for weeks , when we have processed the interviews , which are still under way as i write			2
but our initial impressions are that a number of people still focus on the features of hurricanes that were emphasized decades in the past , particularly the specific path of the storm 's eye and the speed of the winds			1
they do not adequately appreciate that a storm can be violently destructive hundreds of miles from its center , and that it can bring damage from threats other than wind -- threats that are particularly serious for @entity11			1
the scientific understanding of hurricanes has not yet been fully translated into public understanding			1
opinion : as @entity11 descends , tips from @entity54 survivors i did have some time for breaks , though , on this sunday of work			0
in the morning , i went to the gym , where television screens gave details about the evacuations in low - lying areas and alerted people to the closure of the subways that evening			1
after lunch , i went to pick up some additional food			0
the pedestrians in my neighborhood were not strolling leisurely , but rather hurrying to supermarkets and drugstores , or walking back home , with heavy bags of supplies			0
in the mid-afternoon , after a round of e-mails to colleagues , my wife and i decided to take a walk through the park in our neighborhood , before the mandatory closing at 5 p.m. went into effect			0
we knew that we might not be able to go outside for a day or two			0
here , too , there were fewer people strolling than usual			1
the gray sky and strong breezes might have frightened off or discouraged some of the ones who were done with their preparations			0
the park was occupied largely by dog walkers , who recognized that their pets would soon be confined to their apartments			0
@entity11 could bring ' catastrophe , ' affect 60 million we paused at an overlook with a view west to the @entity101 , and saw ships heading north , seeking safe waters			0
in the open waters off @entity106 , waves are projected to reach 40 feet or higher , and even in @entity107 they might crest at five or six feet			0
conditions would be calmer further upstream			0
what impressed me was the large size of the wakes that the ships made as they rushed against the outgoing tide			0
the ships that travel upriver usually wait for an incoming tide to carry them			0
but these ships could afford no delay			0
as we turned to leave the park , i looked back at the river , still ebbing rapidly			0
i knew that the tides would turn and the storm arrive in full fury			1
and i thought of the most vulnerable structure in @entity128 , the sea wall at the southern tip of the island			2
this wall , which protects the city 's subways from flooding , is nine feet high , usually a firm bulwark			2
but it faces three forces that bring waters higher			0
the tides are the first , and the second is the water pushed coastward by storms			0
the third is climate change			1
throughout the 20th century , sea levels were rising as a result of the warming of the oceans and the melting of ice in glaciers			2
this rise , which varies from place to place depending on patterns of wind and ocean currents , has been about a foot in the @entity161			0
opinion : how @entity11 will test @entity163 , @entity164 when this foot is added to the four feet of the high tides at the full moon , it reaches five feet , more than half the height of the sea wall			2
@entity11 's relentless winds have been pushing water in front of the storm as it approaches the coast ; this storm surge will be heightened by the configuration of the coast at @entity107			1
if it exceeds four feet , the subways will flood , disrupting transportation for days or weeks , and causing billions of dollars of damage			2
last year , @entity183 also arrived at a time of especially high tides , and its storm surge came within inches of flooding the sea well			1
storms and tides are natural , but sea level rise is not			1
as it continues , @entity107 grows more vulnerable			0
the ships could sail north up the @entity101 to escape danger , but sea walls and the subways are fixed in space			1
governments , media and communities spring into action with the immediate threat of a hurricane , taking steps to prepare and to reduce harm			2
they issue warnings , remind people to obtain supplies , close parks and subways , open shelters , and organize evacuations			1
will they take the larger and more difficult actions to protect themselves from the slower , and far greater , threat of climate change ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity219 .			1

@entity219 : some people still look at hurricanes through an *outdated* perspective
he says officials have been *pro-active* in preparing for the storm
climate change has raised sea level , he says , and storm surge *endangers* subways
he asks : why ca *n't* we take the threat of climate change as seriously as the storm ?
