but take some of that vacation time to explore the holiday spirit in action			2
at these five wonderlands around the country and the world , you 'll find the wonder of winter , the wonder of shopping and the wonder of @entity15 up close			1
@entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 this year , the @entity16 is known for two things			1
it 's the most visited recreational forest in the country , a hub of skiing aficionados , thanks to nearby @entity25 and @entity26 , and it 's also the home of the 2012 @entity29 @entity28			1
since 1970 , the @entity30 has partnered with a different @entity31 to choose a new tree for the @entity28 lawn			2
this year it was @entity16			1

the @entity42 tours the country during the holiday season before making its way back to @entity45 -- and it offers visitors a chance to see a piece of the @entity16 on the move			1
those who see the forest itself should expect a different experience than in the warmer months , according to @entity54 , who works in public affairs and sustainable operations at the park			1

" it 's just on such a grand scale , " @entity79 said			0
" and with the music combined with the lights combined with the themes , i think it kind of resonates			2
" @entity99 , @entity100 @entity99 and the surrounding @entity101 see the majority of visitors between may and october , but that does n't mean that the area is lacking when the weather gets colder			0
thanks to its proximity to the mountains , @entity99 offers " just what the @entity101 offer , " said @entity110 , spokeswoman at the @entity111			0
that means a variety of outdoor recreation , in a park that stretches across 6 million acres			2

still , @entity110 called @entity99 a " cool little alpine village in the middle of the wilderness			0
" at the center of town is an old ski jump , while the surrounding wilderness of the @entity101 holds multiple museums for exploring and 43 peaks for hiking			0
one of them , @entity134 , is paved all the way to the top , so that families can visit the peak by car			0
