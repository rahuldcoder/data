-- the @entity1 seems a long time ago			2
the voices of @entity6 and @entity7 , the uprising in @entity9 , the street protests in @entity3 and @entity4 promised a popular awakening in countries where politics had been confined to an elite			2
the @entity15 democracies -- if a little hesitantly -- took the side of the demonstrators			2
but with the exception of @entity24 , their contribution to the @entity22 world 's new beginning comprised moral support and the promise of financial help once new governments were formed			1
the @entity29 used some of its substantial political clout in the region to ease @entity33 and @entity35 @entity34 out of power in @entity37 and @entity38 respectively			1
" soft power " -- advice , mediation , persuasion and some aid -- was leveraged to influence events ; the use of " hard power " as in @entity42 was not even contemplated			2
as president @entity48 put it in a speech in @entity51 in june 2009 , " events in @entity42 have reminded @entity29 of the need to use diplomacy and build international consensus to resolve our problems whenever possible			1
" indeed , we can recall the words of @entity60 , who said , ' i hope that our wisdom will grow with our power and teach us that the less we use our power , the greater it will be , ' " he said			2
the president 's then - defense secretary , @entity65 , expanded on the theme , saying that more needed to be spent on " diplomacy , strategic communications , foreign assistance , civic action and economic reconstruction and development			1
" opinion : for @entity29 , @entity75 is truly a problem from hell the @entity48 administration has sought to reduce the @entity29 military footprint abroad , pulling all @entity29 troops out of @entity42 and setting a timetable for the withdrawal of combat troops from @entity84			1
it is wary of the use of military power for all but the most forensic of operations ( the raid that killed @entity90 ) or those that achieve defined aims at next to no political cost ( drones over @entity3 )			1
rare and rapid international agreement , blessed at the @entity98 , allowed for a swift military response to prevent a bloodbath in @entity9 , which had been taken over by opponents of the @entity103 regime			1
the targets -- most of them along a strip of the @entity107 coast -- were poorly defended and easily hit from the sea or airbases in @entity110			2
even so , @entity112 warplanes flew 21,000 missions over nearly six months to enforce a no - fly zone			2
and the result of all that military investment was a few weeks of euphoria with the ousting of @entity103 -- and many months since of chronic volatility , as groups sympathetic to @entity121 have sown chaos and turf wars have sapped the new government 's authority			1
before his death in @entity9 in september , ambassador @entity127 ' own communications revealed huge frustration and some anxiety about the proliferation of militia and growing violence in @entity24			1
this week , @entity134 of the @entity135 , a longtime watcher of jihadism in @entity138 , wrote that one of the main militant groups , @entity147 , " has been taking advantage of the lack of state control by building local communal ties , which is strengthening its ability to operate in more locations than @entity9			2
" forcible intervention by superior powers can quickly demolish regimes that lack legitimacy			0
but in societies where there is no tradition of civic society or democracy , deep sectarian or ethnic fissures and desperate economic problems , helping to fashion the new is an almost overwhelming demand			0
while @entity29 troops remained in @entity42 , @entity161 and @entity162 political groups had to obey some rules of the road , and @entity166 had to exercise its influence discreetly			1
but since their departure , sectarian violence has surged to its worst levels in five years			0
when a group believes that it is in an existential struggle , it is unlikely to heed the advice of diplomats who soon will leave for home			0
@entity37 's multilayered problems -- political , economic and demographic -- defy any short - term solution			2
there are more than 80 million @entity37 , most of them close to or below the poverty line and under the age of 25			0
faint hopes for a democratic alternative to @entity33 have been snuffed out			0
concerted diplomacy failed to persuade president @entity187 to be " inclusive , " as @entity48 put it , or take critical economic decisions			1
after @entity187 was ousted , back - corridor pleas to the @entity37 military to avoid civilian casualties , not declare a state of emergency and open new channels of dialogue all fell on deaf ears			1
missile strikes on @entity75 likely response to chemical attack @entity48 's preference for diplomacy and international consensus goes only so far , especially when there 's so little common ground that a @entity29 - @entity206 summit is not even worth holding			1
but there is no appetite in the @entity209 for more muscular nation - ( re ) building , especially after the experiences of @entity84 and @entity42			1
@entity48 recognized this when he said in @entity51 in 2009 , " no system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other			1
" such campaigns are unpopular at home and very costly , demanding multiyear commitments for very little reward			0
groups that were at each other 's throats suddenly turn their fire on a common enemy : the invader			0
many observers expect that is exactly what would happen in @entity75 if there was a full - throated military intervention			1
and pacifying a country with so many weapons , so many open borders and so many sectarian fault lines would demand a force larger than the 168,000 combat troops deployed to @entity42 at the peak of the @entity29 commitment			1
that is not on the agenda			0
so the use of " hard power " in @entity75 would be limited to punishment strikes on the grounds that " something must be done			0
" such strikes would begin to degrade the @entity251 regime 's military infrastructure and discourage it from using chemical weapons but would probably not tip the military balance decisively			2
and they may become politically unavoidable if the @entity98 inspectors who have gone to @entity256 find irrefutable evidence that chemical weapons killed hundreds of people last week			0
they would also be welcomed by the regime 's opponents in the hope that more would follow			0
but they would be a metaphoric slap on the wrist			0
there is no " exit " or " end " strategy in such strikes , and it seems likely that hardline @entity269 groups would be best placed to take advantage of a weakening @entity251 regime			0
there is the faint chance that proof of the regime 's use of chemical weapons would oblige @entity206 and @entity281 to at least modify their resistance at the @entity284 to a tougher stance against @entity251			0
but turning that into a common position would demand exceptionally deft diplomacy			0
the @entity15 powers are not impotent in the @entity290			0
in @entity37 , the generals ' long relationship with their @entity29 counterparts ( and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing ) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past			1
the @entity29 and @entity299 can also join the @entity300 in providing emergency aid to @entity37 ( the @entity302 and others have already pledged $ 15 billion )			1
in @entity75 , @entity304 can continue to cajole the moderate opposition to behave more coherently and reassert itself in the face of the @entity308 ' rise			0
it can continue to work with the government of @entity3 in targeting @entity121 operatives in more remote areas with drones			0
in @entity38 , there is still an influential , moderate strand in the ruling @entity269 party , @entity316 , and a strong middle class with a secular outlook			0
the leaders of both countries have recently been in @entity304			0
but as age - old sectarian and religious hatreds rage across much of the @entity290 , from @entity323 in northern @entity324 to @entity323 in @entity24 , there is little more that outsiders can do but wait for the volcano to finish erupting .			1

@entity48 administration has sought to reduce @entity29 military footprint abroad
rare international agreement resulted in action in @entity24
but volatility has set in after brief @entity336 euphoria
the @entity209 has lost appetite for robust nation - building
