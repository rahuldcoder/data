-- the battle over the proposed @entity2 , which would stretch 1,700 miles through six states , from @entity4 , @entity5 , across the @entity7 heartland , and into @entity8 to @entity10 refineries , is intensifying			1
the final congressional hearing on the $ 7 billion project is scheduled for october 7 in @entity13			0
and the @entity14 , which has to sign off on the deal because of the international scope of the project , has said a decision is expected before the end of the year			1
environmental groups are furious about the pipeline , which would carry at least 700,000 barrels of tar sands oil a day to @entity7 refineries , and the plan to run it through sensitive environmental areas			1
during a two - week protest in front of the @entity30 more than 1,200 people were arrested , including actress @entity31 and leading @entity34 climate scientist @entity33			1
veteran activist @entity36 , with the group @entity35 , was the main organizer of the civil disobedience campaign or sit - in , which ended this weekend			1
the group wanted to send a message to president @entity40 because the project also needs a presidential permit to move ahead			0
" there are two basic problems here			0
one they want to run a 1,700 - mile pipe and they 're going to run it through some of the most sensitive land in this country : the @entity52 ( which provides drinking water for 20 million people ) in the middle of the country , " @entity36 said			1
@entity36 thinks the second problem may be the bigger issue			0
" even if you can get all that oil to @entity8 without spilling it , what you 've done is open up a huge pipeline into the second - largest pool of carbon on @entity69 , after the @entity61 oil fields			1
" he quotes leading scientists as saying if oil companies tap this huge pool of tar sands in a big way , " it is essentially game over for the climate			1
" the oil industry disputes this			2
and the @entity14 concluded in a final environmental review on august 26 that the pipeline would have no significant impact			1
" there would be no significant impacts to most resources along the proposed pipeline corridor , " @entity84 assistant secretary @entity85 told reporters on august 27			2
a spokeswoman for the @entity92 , @entity93 , says @entity94 is going to develop the pipeline , whether the @entity7 is involved or not and that @entity96 is poised to get involved in exporting the oil if the @entity7 does n't			2
@entity98 says she thinks the protesters are really protesting against jobs			0
she points to the flat @entity102 jobs report for august and the nation 's 9.1 % unemployment rate last month			2
" this pipeline can create 20,000 jobs , almost immediately			0
so we are very much for this pipeline			0
we think it 's great for the @entity7 economy ' cause it will create jobs and it 's also good for energy security			0
" later this month @entity36 says more civil disobedience actions are planned in @entity5 on @entity116 in @entity117			2
he also says they 're planning another big protest in @entity13 on october 7 , the day of the final hearing			0
the pipeline would draw from oil sands deposits in @entity5 and pass through @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity8 , with construction on an existing pipeline in @entity129			1
it is estimated to cost $ 7 billion .			0

environmental groups say *dangerous* pipeline would go through sensitive land
it would bring oil from @entity5 's tar sands to @entity8
2 - week sit - in in front of @entity30 ended this weekend
@entity14 says it will decide by end of the year
