@entity0 joined the @entity1 and its allies in the fight against @entity4 -- but any mission will come with a huge price tag			1
the @entity0 parliament has approved airstrikes in @entity9 against the terror group which prime minister @entity11 has called one of " staggering " brutality			1
@entity11 had said @entity0 should join international allies in combating @entity4 , an action that he warned would " take not just months , but years			1
" while the total cost will depend on the intensity and length of operation , past experience can give some guidance , @entity22 , research director from the @entity24 said			0
@entity22 pointed to the @entity0 's seven month involvement in @entity26 through 2011 , which cost around $ 390 million , including missiles and flight hours			1
the bill is additional to standard defense budgets , which include staffing costs and weapons spend			0
last year , the @entity0 defense budget was $ 60 billion			0
@entity22 said he would expect the cost of @entity4 airstrikes to be in the " ballpark , " of the @entity26 operation , " assuming we only use air power and the campaign lasts for a couple of years			2
" @entity11 has said that the mission against @entity4 could last " years			0
" however , it is @entity1 - led rather than the operation in @entity26 , in which @entity46 countries took the lead			2
' unique ' missiles @entity11 , in friday 's debate aimed at convincing parliament to approve airstrikes , said @entity0 has " unique assets " no other coalition ally can contribute			1
@entity11 named the @entity55 precision missile , which he said minimized risk of civilian casualties , as one only @entity0 could contribute			1
the missiles can target convoys as well as fast moving , fleeting targets that were previously harder to strike , according to @entity63 's senior weapons analyst @entity62			0
the @entity55 , which travels at supersonic speed , is a 1.8 - meter missile weighing just under 50 kg. advanced radar equipment enables it to guides itself to the target , so pilots do n't need to maneuver to release it			1
@entity63 's estimates each missile costs around $ 240,000			0
@entity55 missiles are compatible with the @entity0 's @entity74 aircraft			1
the aircraft were used by @entity0 troops for relief missions in northern @entity9 just over a month ago			2
six of these are ready for deployment at the @entity0 's @entity82 base in @entity83			2
flying the @entity84 costs around $ 57,000 per hour , according to information released in a parliamentary debate about @entity26 in 2011			0
from the @entity83 base , the aircraft could reach @entity9 in just over an hour			2
@entity62 said the @entity82 also has @entity74 's @entity90 cruise missiles , which cost $ 1.3 million each , and submarine - launched @entity92 cruise missiles			0
these can be used to target areas that ca n't be accessed by planes , for example due to defenses , and cost round $ 1.5 million each			0
@entity1 forces have been using @entity92 missiles for airstrikes in @entity102 earlier this week -- dropping 47 of them on monday evening			1
in total , the @entity1 has conducted 20 strikes in @entity102 and 198 in @entity9 from august 8 through september 23			1
many of those operations were n't included in the @entity109 's daily average spending figure of $ 7.5 million at the end of last month .			0

@entity0 can start *bombing* @entity4 within hours , as it has six fighter jets on standby in @entity83
@entity0 forces have @entity55 precision missiles , high - tech weapons others do n't have
the @entity1 is leading the airstrikes against @entity4 in @entity9 and @entity102
