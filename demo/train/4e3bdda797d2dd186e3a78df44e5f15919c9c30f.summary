@entity0 , @entity1 -- for @entity4 swimmer @entity3 , the last two months have been a whirlwind			1
" full of the best moments and the scariest moments of my life , " says the 24 - year - old @entity4 swimmer			1
@entity3 said he felt angry when he found out he had testicular cancer			1
" getting to the @entity4 was , has always been , my swimming dream since i was 8 or 9 years old			2
you know , right after i started swimming it was , ' i want to make an @entity4 team			2
that 's where i want to be '			2
" in june , a week before the qualifying round of the @entity4 he was told he had testicular cancer			1
" my initial reaction was probably anger more than anything else , " he says			2
" i 'm used to being in control of everything			2
i 'm in control of how i train , how i race and then to all of a sudden have that control ripped away from me was tough			2
" after weeks of tests to determine the " stage " or spread of the cancer , @entity3 's team of doctors cleared him to compete in the @entity31 , which meant carefully monitoring his tumor but delaying treatment			1
though putting off the surgery was controversial to some , @entity3 says it was an educated choice based on numerous doctor evaluations			1
" i hope people understand that if i was in a different position with my test results , then i would n't have put off having surgery			2
" he swam a personal best in the 200 meter breaststroke			2
he did not qualify for the finals			2
cancer was a motivator , he says , because he knew it meant he could be facing his last competition			1
he put everything he had into that heat			2
" leave it all in the pool , and i do n't look back and regret anything as far as how i raced			0
" once back from @entity53 , @entity3 invited @entity2 to spend time with him the night before his surgery in @entity0 , @entity1			1
though admittedly a little scared , he spent the evening relaxing with his family , cooking dinner , walking the dog			0
a source of inspiration , he says , were fans who shared their stories of beating cancer			1
" they send me their story and it helps me to learn that people are going through the same thing i am all over the world , " says @entity3			1
" they all affect me in a different way and it 's been really encouraging to share in this experience with other people			0
" testicular cancer will be diagnosed in about 1 in 300 men in their lifetime			1
it is the most common form of cancer for 15 - to 34 - year - olds			1
it is also one of the most curable if discovered early			0
nearly 140,000 men in the @entity84 are testicular cancer survivors			1
@entity3 says he experienced no symptoms of cancer and came across the tumor by chance			1
" i 've been in a @entity91 half my life , " he says			0
" so i am really comfortable with my body			0
one day i just felt something that was n't suppose to be there			0
i decided to go and get it checked out			0
" he adds that although he had the " greatest excuse in the world " -- an @entity4 dream -- to ignore the lump , he understood the importance of early detection			0
@entity3 's father @entity103 , is battling lung cancer and responding well to treatment			1
" a lot of guys , if they hear a rattle in their car , they 're at the mechanic the next day , " he says			0
" but if they feel something [ physically ] that they do n't think should be there , it takes them a year to get to their doctor and that 's just is not smart			0
there 's really no excuse because it can save your life			0
" fast forward to @entity3 's recent operation at @entity127			1
@entity2 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity128 was with @entity3 during the surgery and spoke with the lead surgeon , dr. @entity130 , moments afterward			1
" i think the operation went very well , " @entity130 said			0
" @entity3 's a very healthy young man , very thin , in excellent shape			1
that makes my job easy			0
" later that week , @entity3 's pathology results revealed that the operation removed the most of the cancer			1
" the majority of it is gone			0
" there is a small chance it could come back but i should n't need chemotherapy at this point , so i am really optimistic			0
" his treatment plan is to keep a close eye on his health for the next year with regular medical tests			2
" obviously , it would have been nice if the doctor said , ' you 're completely in the clear , ' but my results are exactly what the doctors expected			0
" @entity3 says the cancer diagnosis gave him a different perspective on life			1
" i appreciate life much more now , " he says			0
" i do n't let myself get upset about the little nitpicky things anymore			0
food even seems to taste better			0
" as for @entity3 's swimming career , he plans to compete in the 2009 @entity164 in @entity165			1
" 2012 [ the next @entity4 ] is a push for me			0
right now i 'm just kind of taking it year by year and we 'll see what happens			0
