@entity0 , @entity1 -- firefighters battled a blaze caused by @entity6 airstrikes at a food - storage complex monday in @entity0 , increasingly a front - line city in the conflict between @entity1 government troops and rebels fighting to oust longtime ruler @entity12			1
the firefighters doused burning sacks of flour with water after bombs punctured the high roofs of three facilities packed with flour , rice and cooking oil in @entity0 , on the @entity1 coast east of @entity24			1
an unexploded bomb lay buried in the concrete floor of one of the buildings , beneath a hole in the ceiling where sunlight streamed through			0
@entity0 is about 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) west of the opposition - held port city of @entity34 , and the front line between the rebels and pro-regime forces is somewhere in between the two cities			1
smoke rising on the horizon and the rumble of artillery in the east suggested that by monday , the fighting had moved closer to the city limits			1
" it 's continuous bombing , morning day and night , " said @entity45 , who stood armed with a radio and camouflage uniform at the entrance to the burning storage center			1
no one was hurt in monday 's attack , @entity45 said			2
but he said five guards had been killed in another bombing run that struck the agricultural police center next door on saturday , leaving little more than a heap of rubble			2
and another attack two days ago demolished what he described as a military base several hundred yards up the road , killing at least two people , he said			0
moments after a busload of international journalists arrived , a handful of @entity1 men ran up before television cameras chanting the oft - repeated pro-regime slogan " @entity72 , @entity12 , @entity1 , nothing else ! " in @entity74			2
when @entity1 government minders last brought @entity2 to @entity0 about a week and a half ago , it was to see a large @entity78 rally in the city 's main square			1
crowds of @entity1 waved green government flags , fired guns in the air , and fervently pledged their loyalty to their embattled leader			2
but the scene was dramatically different monday , as fire trucks and ambulances regularly raced through the city 's largely deserted streets			1
many shops appeared to be closed , and the ominous rumble of warplanes could be heard overhead periodically			0
the @entity6 alliance says it has been hitting targets it describes as tanks , " military storage facilities " and artillery pieces in the vicinity of @entity0 on a daily basis for the past week			1
officials from the embattled @entity12 government also say the air strikes have intensified in frequency			2
" people here call @entity6 the crazy one which lost its sanity , " said @entity106 , an official from the local city government			1
" it is waging wide - scale war on the people			2
" @entity117 was standing in front of the rubble of a health clinic that he said had been demolished by a pre-dawn attack on monday			2
several bulldozers dug through wreckage strewn with medical supplies , including syringes , medication and even a microscope			0
government officials said they were looking for the bodies of three people believed to be buried underneath , and said the bodies of eight people had been pulled out earlier in the day			2
journalists did not see any evidence of dead or wounded at the site			0
barely 100 yards away , however , drivers had parked a number of pick - up trucks under the cover of olive trees			0
some of the vehicles were smeared with mud and the equipment in their chassis covered with branches -- an apparent camouflage tactic seen used by both loyalist and rebel fighters around @entity1			0
uniformed troops could also be seen resting in the shade of the orchard			0
responding to the @entity1 government 's claims to journalists that a health clinic and food - storage facility had been hit , @entity6 had found no evidence to support the allegations , a @entity6 representative said			1
@entity6 forces had hit a number of targets near @entity0 that were " military in nature " monday , the representative said			1
" these targets were a command and control node and a vehicle storage facility that contained military vehicles			0
" this is not the first time that such allegations have been made and as is the case with all @entity6 strikes a thorough damage assessment is conducted afterwards			1
as always great care is taken to minimize the risk of civilian casualties			0
" we are always concerned by any reports of civilian casualties , take them seriously and the appropriate analysis will be conducted to ascertain the legitimacy , or otherwise , of these allegations			0
" in the afternoon , government minders brought journalists to the ruins of a mosque and school located in an all - but - deserted residential neighborhood several kilometers to the east of @entity0 's city center			1
an air attack clearly destroyed the compound , but there were conflicting reports from government minders regarding which week the strike took place			1
as another small group of pro-regime supporters began chanting at the ruins of the school , the thud of big guns continued to rumble			0
one of the minders said @entity6 warships in the @entity207 were shelling loyalist positions , but it was impossible for @entity2 to confirm whether the fire was incoming or outgoing			1
two vehicles loaded with women , children and belongings drove past the shattered buildings , heading west -- away from the fighting			0
suddenly , the unmistakable cloud from an air strike mushroomed up several miles away to the east			0
a four - door sedan , caked with mud and carrying several men wearing camouflage and carrying @entity226 rifles , drove past , also headed away from the direction of the front lines as the cloud from a second apparent air strike billowed in the distance			0
" come on , let 's go , " the minders repeated			2
" we have to go , they could bomb us here any time , " they said , some of them visibly nervous			0
monday 's government tour of @entity0 was over , but the fighting there appeared to have barely begun			1
@entity2 's @entity241 contributed to this report .			0
