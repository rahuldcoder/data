@entity0 , @entity1 -- i am a big - time news junkie but there are days in which i do n't turn on the television because i do n't want to find out who 's next			2
the next to be torn down			2
the next to have their nice and shiny public persona ripped apart , doused with gas and set on fire -- done in by the always lethal combination of private shortcomings and stupidity			2
or whatever it is that makes politicians and other public figures believe " no one is going to find out			2
" but we do find out , do n't we ? if you cheat on your spouse -- the mistress talks			2
take a bribe -- there 's a receipt			2
whisper something offensive under your breath , in your car -- alone -- with the windows down and the radio up and somehow , someway there 's an audible clip of it posted on @entity40			2
and so i have my days when i try to avoid the news			2
i do n't blame reporters for doing their job			0
only people running for office tend to do that			1
rather there are days i do n't need to be told about this new kind of @entity50 we 're living in			1
the kind without gods or role models			1
you remember that @entity59 song that said we did n't need another one of those ? well at times , today 's 24 - hour news cycle can be a callous reminder that we never really had heroes in the first place			1
we were just blissfully ignorant			0
imagine if @entity66 or @entity67 was around when @entity68 was singing to president @entity69 or if smart phones were available to capture video of @entity72 getting drunk in bars and picking up women			0
our opinions of those iconic figures would certainly be different			0
and we would n't be behaving as if things have somehow gotten worse			0
we would know that the country was never as pious as we like to think it was			0
each time i hear someone like @entity82 romanticize our past -- as if everyone was living in an episode of " @entity86 " -- i throw up in my mouth just a little			1
sure our history is peppered with self - sacrificing individuals who did a tremendous amount of good for the whole of society			1
and if the narrative would just stop there we would n't be so troubled to learn about their flaws or the flaws of self - sacrificing people of today			1
but we do n't stop			0
and when we find out our gods are not perfect , we 're confused			1
we do n't know what to do with a storyline where the perceived protagonist is complex			0
heroes are n't supposed to do bad things			1
that 's what villains are for			0
so either the good supersedes the bad , or the bad makes it impossible to remember the good			1
we do n't like it when such duality exists in one person			0
we do n't want to know our heroes are human			1
for example , i have two images of the rev. @entity119 locked in my head			0
the first is the brave civil rights soldier who risked his life working side by side with dr. @entity126 the second is the lowlife who not only brought his pregnant mistress to the @entity131 but posed for pictures with her standing next to president @entity133			0
what do you do with that kind of duality ? you turn off the television			1
at least for little while			0
and you try to remember that few people are as good as advertised and even fewer are as bad as rumored			1
that in the new @entity50 , pedestals are best reserved for flowers , not people			1
part of the reason why so many people came rushing to @entity149 's defense is because the @entity151 coach had done so much good for the school and the community			1
he was supposed to be a man above reproach , born within the shadow of our greatest generation			0
it is so hard for some to accept the possibility that one of our great heroes could have been involved in something not becoming of the title			1
and i found that sentiment more shocking than @entity149 's connection to the allegations			0
after all , scandals involving football coaches at big - time schools happen so frequently it was hard for me to imagine anyone being surprised			0
if a story broke tomorrow that president @entity177 was cheating on @entity178 , i would be disappointed but not surprised			1
how could i be given the number of stories about politicians having extramarital affairs ? i do n't believe such an attitude is cynical , just pragmatic			0
i do n't personally know @entity149 or @entity177			0
but i do know people can make mistakes			2
and if we 're to ever have public figures to look up to ever again , we have to start allowing for that			2
because in the old @entity50 , our heroes could be " perfect " -- since the public would never find out their flaws			1
those kind of stories simply would not be written @entity194 in the new @entity50 that is n't possible			1
with technology and social media and citizen journalism , every rock that used to go unturned is now being flipped , lit and put on tv			0
which is why sometimes , i just do n't turn mine on			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			1

@entity203 : when our heroes let us down , we 're *bitterly* disappointed
he says the more we learn about people , the more we see their flaws
few people are as good as advertised , or as bad as rumored , he says
@entity203 : we 're living in a new kind of @entity50 , one without heroes
