-- has the world of football bitten back ? one of the game 's most controversial characters , @entity5 , has been left off the 23 - man longlist for the prestigious @entity7 for " disgracing himself on the pitch			1
" the award , which is voted for by coaches and captains of national teams and journalists across the world selected by @entity16 , will be awarded in @entity17 , @entity18 , on january 12			1
while the likes of holder @entity21 and four - time winner @entity23 are up for the gong , @entity5 's name is nowhere to be seen , despite the former @entity26 striker jointly winning the @entity27 with the @entity28 forward			1
@entity29 's @entity5 returned to action in last weekend 's @entity31 against @entity28 after completing his four - month ban for biting @entity33 during @entity36 's @entity35 clash with @entity37			1
football 's bad boy has paid the price for his behavior according to @entity42 , the @entity43 - based correspondent for @entity16			2
" the criteria used for the selection of the longlist of @entity7 contenders by @entity39 and @entity48 are very clear , " @entity42 told @entity0			1
" a player who has disgraced himself on the pitch as @entity5 has , can not and will not be included , regardless of his achievements throughout the calendar year			2
" in short , under no circumstances could the @entity53 be considered for the award			0
i think that this is clear enough			0
" @entity5 joined the @entity59 club for a transfer fee reported to be in the region of Â £ 75 million ( $ 128.5 million ) following a sensational season with @entity26			0
the 27 - year - old scored 31 goals for @entity26 with the team just missing out on the @entity67 title , although it did qualify for the @entity69 for the first time in four seasons			1
@entity5 's snub looks to have come following his bite on @entity33 -- the third time he has committed such an offense during his career			0
@entity77 , football writer for the @entity79 newspaper who watched @entity5 on a weekly basis during his time at @entity26 , says the forward can only blame himself for his absence from the list of nominees			2
" on the basis of his outstanding form last season , @entity5 's omission from the nominees for the @entity7 is staggering , " @entity77 told @entity0			1
" by common consensus , the forward was among world football 's best performing players as he inspired a wholly unexpected title challenge from @entity26			2
" in terms of form , ability and performance levels , any list of the world 's top players over the last 12 months which does not include @entity5 will inevitably provoke debate and , in some cases , shock			1
" the only conclusion to be drawn is that his bite on @entity33 cost him inclusion and , as ever , @entity5 has only himself to blame for this			0
" regardless of that , his standing as a player has already been reflected in more meaningful fashion by the fact that @entity29 were willing to pay Â £ 75 million to sign him			0
" while the debate over @entity5 continues to rage , @entity21 and @entity23 are likely to go head - to - head once again , while there are several other candidates who will fancy their chances			1
@entity119 and @entity29 star @entity120 is on the list alongside the likes of @entity28 quartet @entity123 , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 @entity128 and @entity130 goalkeeper @entity129 enjoyed a fine year , helping his club win the league title before lifting the @entity35 in @entity119			1
@entity129 's @entity128 teammate , @entity133 , who helped the @entity134 qualify for the semifinals in @entity119 , is also in with a shout			0
@entity128 captain @entity137 is on the list alongside teammate @entity139 and @entity140 , the man who scored the winner in the @entity35 final			1
five players from @entity145 's @entity67 have been nominated including @entity147 's @entity146 , @entity149 's @entity148 and the @entity151 trio of @entity152 , @entity153 and goalkeeper @entity154			0
@entity155 and @entity157 midfielder @entity156 is the sole representative from @entity159 , while @entity160 is boosted by the presence of @entity162 and @entity163 forward @entity164			0
in the managerial stakes , 10 nominees have been named including @entity151 coach @entity167 -- despite his failure to win a trophy last season			0
@entity171 , the man who led @entity130 to victory at the @entity35 will be one of the favorites to be named as coach of the year			2
@entity28 manager @entity175 , who led his club to @entity69 glory last term , is joined by @entity179 of @entity128 , @entity180 of @entity147 and @entity181 , who presided over @entity183 's title win in @entity184 last season			0
there is also room for @entity187 , who took @entity188 to the @entity35 final , @entity190 of @entity149 , @entity191 of @entity37 and @entity192 , coach of @entity193 .			0
