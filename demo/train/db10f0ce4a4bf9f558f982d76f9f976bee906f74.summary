-- there are few sports that are so dominated by a single person like the way the women 's pole vault is ruled by 26 - year @entity8 @entity7			1
eyes on the prize : @entity7 has often complained about a lack of real competition in her event			0
every time the world and @entity16 champion competes it is expected that she will spring to new heights and push women 's pole - vaulting to new levels			1
she has broken the world record 16 times , almost equaling the feat of the great @entity24 , who broke the men 's outdoor pole vault record 17 times between 1984 and 1994			1
since jumping to her first world record in 2003 and becoming the first woman to jump over 5 - meters in 2005 she as also become something of a glamorous sporting celebrity			1
after setting five new world records in 2005 , it took almost three years for her to set a new mark of 5.04m in july 2008 , a fallow period that made her pursuit of world records a personal matter			0
after setting her world record mark in july this year at a competition in @entity41 , she told press : " i wanted to improve my personal best and that 's what i did			1
i see this world record as a personal one			1
" a driven and focused competitor , she has also become famous for her coolness under pressure			0
before her latest world record jump she was driving around the track in the back of a vintage car with sprinter @entity53 , while her fellow competitors had already started the competition			2
not shy of media and publicity , her sporting achievements , athleticism and looks have made her a pin - up for women 's athletics and attracted a number of big - name sponsors			2
while her achievements can be allied to that of @entity24 it has been noted that her media - and sponsor - friendly attitude makes her more akin to compatriot @entity70			1
her celebrity status is a world away from her modest background			0
born in @entity75 in 1982 it was only until a couple of years ago that she lived with her parents and younger sister in the city of her birth , before moving to @entity41			0
she trained first of all as a gymnast until the age of 15 when her coach decided she was too tall			0
commentators and fellow competitors have noted that her gymnastic training has helped give her an extra edge in the event			0
after defending her title in @entity93 , her place in the sporting pantheon of great female athletes seems secure			0
while emulating @entity24 , @entity7 has said before that closing the gap between the heights the men and women can jump is another of her personal challenges , and with her own talent and the help of @entity24 's former coach she may go a long way towards achieving that .			2
