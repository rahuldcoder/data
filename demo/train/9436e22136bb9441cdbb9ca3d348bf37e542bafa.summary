-- the first ever regular season @entity2 game was played in @entity3 this weekend , as the @entity4 took on the @entity5 at @entity7 's @entity6			1
the @entity9 capital proved to be lucky for the @entity4			2
the east coast team won both legs of the two - game tie -- they claimed the first 116 - 103 on friday and the second 137 - 136 in triple overtime on saturday			1
despite basketball not enjoying the same high - profile in @entity17 as it does across @entity18 , fans packed the 18,600 capacity venue -- which played host to an exhibition between the @entity22 and the @entity23 a year ago -- to watch the two highly competitive games			1
in order to make sure anyone new to basketball understood what was going on , an announcer explained who the players , teams and coaches were and gave a commentary to explain the scoring to the crowd			0
but aside from this , the game followed exactly the same format as any other @entity2 game would , with the points scored counting towards the @entity4 and the @entity5 standings in the league this season			1
there was also the same high energy half - time and time - out entertainment taking place on the court , with the two teams ' mascots present to entertain the crowds			0
and just like any big sporting event held in the @entity55 , the event was attended by a host of celebrities			0
football stars @entity59 and @entity60 of @entity61 were spotted courtside , as were @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 from @entity66 rivals @entity67			0
part of the reason for the games being played in @entity7 was to promote basketball in @entity17 ahead of the @entity72 -- to ensure the sport attracts the same large crowds as it did at the previous games in @entity76			1
however , as part of the @entity2 's aim to expand across the globe , this might not be the last time we see games in the lucrative franchise decided on foreign soil			2
@entity2 commissioner @entity85 has hinted that more games could be held in @entity7 and elsewhere in @entity3 and @entity87 -- where demonstrations have also been held previously			1
he even said that there could be @entity3 based teams playing in the @entity2 in the future			2
it certainly does not seem like the players would mind traveling to @entity7 again			0
@entity5 and @entity95 star @entity94 said : " the crowd was unbelievable			0
it 's great the @entity98 are going to be here			0
" the @entity4 ' @entity100 added : " it was fantastic for the @entity101 to experience it and see two really fantastic @entity2 games			1
it gave them great exposure to the game of basketball and hopefully they want to see more			0
