-- an impossibly high - pitched " aaahh " ascended from a churchy organ vamp , proclaiming @entity3 's arrival on the biggest stage he has played since his legendary voodoo tour			1
clad in rugged boots , leather vest and trademark tanktop ( all black ) , he appeared with a perfect confidence and poise that belied his recently broken 12 - year hiatus from the stage			1
his performance at the @entity15 in @entity16 has been anticipated as @entity3 's @entity18 comeback , but the reclusive @entity20 polymath has been unfolding a cautious return			1
it began this january with a short @entity24 club tour , which confirmed that he had n't lost an ounce of mojo			2
he also added a batch of new songs to his repertoire			0
the @entity15 show was the first @entity18 gig on the books , but he warmed up to his big night by jamming covers with " co-pilot " ? uestlove at @entity36 , playing a new song on tv for the @entity39 , and running through a full set -- a dress rehearsal of sorts -- on the 4th of july at the @entity43 in @entity44			1
so come @entity15 , @entity3 and his band of virtuoso studio pros ( including @entity47 on bass and @entity49 on the drums ) were locked in tight			1
they articulated every breathy , rhythmic nuance from @entity3 's distinctive palate			1
one song instantly became another when @entity3 clutched his fist -- classic stage magic he picked up from his idols , or " yodas , " as he calls them			1
the frequent falsetto yelps -- " good @entity68 ! " -- suggested the night 's yoda du jour was @entity62 , although his side - by - side guitar solos with @entity64 ( from the @entity65 ) found @entity66 playing at @entity67 as well			2
@entity3 coolly picked along to " @entity69 " on guitar and sang a breezy take on @entity73 's " @entity72 , " embellished by the lush harmonies of his powerhouse backup vocalists			1
a new song known as " @entity77 " followed , featuring a chunky bass riff that gave way to some of @entity66 's most accessible melodies			0
he 's so comfortable playing the new material that it 's easy to hear the songs as centerpieces of future shows			0
he ditched the guitar for " @entity86 , " which freed up his body to muscularly saunter about the stage and viciously headbang with dynamo vocalist @entity89			2
a sturdy " @entity97 " led into the gentle " @entity90 , " an unreleased song that ? uestlove leaked on @entity93 radio back in 2007 , which featured @entity66 's high - flying , taught falsetto accompanied by smooth guitar licks			2
the 70 - minute festival set was brief for @entity66 's shows , so many of the grooves were abbreviated			2
yet one song that got completely deconstructed and jammed back together was " s * * t , damn , motherf * * * er. " the pleading opening verse was the band 's most intense , raw moment			0
as the song revved up , @entity66 and his singers stalked around the stage in a frenzy , resulting in some toppled drums			2
despite the spike in energy onstage , much of the crowd remained politely subdued			0
@entity3 's set came between @entity116 and @entity117 , both of whom quickly had the mostly female , mostly adult @entity15 attendees on their feet			1
after @entity122 ' saccharine crooning , @entity3 sounded downright unruly , almost abrasive			1
@entity20 is a nebulous descriptor , but @entity3 's funk and soul abstractions highlighted how his approach to the genre is distinct from the festival 's other acts			1
still , he has one undeniable number , and it successfully ensnared the audience			0
solo on piano , he abruptly banged out the opening chord to " @entity138 , " and the energy in the @entity135 immediately focused into a deafening flurry of screams			0
he stopped playing , stood up , shook his head , then flashed a cheeky grin			0
in perfect time , he gracefully returned to his infamous mega-hit , played beautifully and stripped bare			0
" @entity138 " provided the crowd nostalgic pleasure that doubled as a gateway into the richness of @entity3 's prodigious talents , if maybe a few songs too late			2
a well - timed " lady " broke the slow jam spell , and he closed out with his superb new funk thumper , " @entity151			0
" he rode his new groove until the show 's close , screaming , wailing , and frantically conducting the band 's final notes			0
as the heir - apparent to practically every iconic soul singer , the pressure to finish his third studio album and get back on the road has been markedly high , but his solid performance on the big stage proves he has yet to flinch			1
the comeback will continue later this summer when @entity3 tours with @entity167 , @entity15 's saturday headliner			1
just before @entity66 's set , @entity167 commented on the upcoming tour to @entity0 , saying " i felt like it would be refreshing and fun for people to see him and @entity167 on the road together			1
" their tour will make 20 stops in august			0
