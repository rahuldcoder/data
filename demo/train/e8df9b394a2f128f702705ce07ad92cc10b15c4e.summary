a lunar light show circled the globe saturday , rewarding many moongazers with bright , crisp detail of the full moon 's craters and basins			1
called a " perigee " moon by scientists , the phenomenon occurs once a year			1
@entity10 said the moon appears about 14 % bigger and 30 % brighter than other full moons			1
see views of the moon from around the world that 's because it will be as close to @entity18 as it will get for a while -- just over 221,000 miles away			1
@entity22 ireporter @entity20 snapped the yellowish - ochre orb perched on the shoulder of a mountain overlooking @entity26 , @entity27			1
" the colors were spectacular , " wrote @entity20 , 47			1
" the weather here for viewing the moon rise could not have been better			2
" residents of the mainland @entity34 received similar conditions at 11:34 p.m. , @entity36 , the peak of this year 's " super moon			1
" the best time to see the event is just as the moon crosses @entity18 's horizon			2
the moon always looks biggest then , although the reason why is a bit of a mystery			2
viewing the moon behind buildings and trees creates an optical illusion so it appears even larger , making it a perfect time to try to grab some beautiful pictures			1
so why is this full moon so super ? as the moon makes its elliptical orbit around @entity18 , there are specific times when it is closest to and farthest away from our planet			0
@entity60 occurs when the moon is farthest away from us , and perigee occurs when it is closest			1
experts say viewers may not notice a noticeable size difference , given there are no reference points when the moon is high overhead			0
" ' @entity70 ' is a situation when the moon is slightly closer to @entity18 in its orbit than on average , and this effect is most noticeable when it occurs at the same time as a full moon , " @entity72 , chief scientist at @entity10 's @entity73 , said in 2011			0
" so , the moon may seem bigger although the difference in its distance from @entity18 is only a few percent at such times			2
" share your big moon photos among those staying up late saturday was @entity87 of @entity88 , @entity89			1
she took " test " photos of the moon friday and early saturday			2
" i love nature , " said @entity93 , 31 , who has a corporate day job and an online vintage clothing shop			0
" we live on the lake and i love taking photos of the sunset , so anything that is that beautiful , that natural and prominent is great to see			0
the super moon is a natural phenomenon , and that is what is so awesome about it			0
" @entity107 , an ireporter in @entity109 , @entity110 , said the moon " was so bright that i could really see the markings on it quite close ... and yet so far			0
" not everyone was wowed			0
@entity115 , 41 , of @entity116 , @entity117 , took a photo of the moon peeking through clouds			0
' i was actually expecting a much larger moon , considering scientists are calling it a super moon , " he said .			0
