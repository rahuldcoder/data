-- @entity1 tied @entity2 on 73 @entity4 victories after sinking a sensational chip from off the green late in the final round of the @entity7 on sunday			1
the former world no. 1 was congratulated by the legendary " @entity2 " after completing a five - under - par 67 which gave @entity1 a two - shot victory			1
@entity2 , who founded the @entity12 tournament and designed its @entity14 course , said the 36 - year - old 's chip from the rough at the par - three 16th hole was " the gutsiest and best shot i 've ever seen in my life			1
" @entity20 ' second victory this year left them second equal in the all - time @entity4 list , nine behind the late @entity22			2
late lapses cost @entity1 at @entity24 " i 've been very proud of what i 've done so far and i feel like i 've got a lot of years ahead of me , " said @entity1 , who raised his hopes of a first major win since 2008 at this month 's @entity27 at @entity29 's @entity28			1
he has 14 already -- four behind @entity2 ' record total			2
" i 'm excited , because i 'm hitting the golf ball real well -- and at @entity28 the people who have done well there have hit the ball well , " @entity1 said			2
while @entity1 ended a 30 - month wait for a @entity4 title at the @entity39 in march , he then struggled to maintain that form as he finished 40th at the masters , missed the cut at @entity43 and then tied for 40th at the @entity44			1
he has had to defend himself from criticism over the work he is doing with coach @entity47 to rebuild his swing , but if @entity1 needs evidence of a turning point in his fortunes then he will look no further than the 16th hole at @entity14			0
having hit his tee shot into the deep rough , he took aim with a wedge			0
as the gathered spectators inevitably cried " get in the hole ! " the ball did just that -- and @entity1 exploded with trademark fist pumping that was once a regular sight on the golf circuit before marital problems and injuries took their toll on his fortunes			0
@entity65 seeks solution , @entity1 finds one " i knew if i hit it short it would have been down and left , if i hit it long it was in the water , " @entity1 said of his chip			0
" the lie was n't all that great , that was the hard part			0
i had to take a cut at it , and it came out just perfect			0
" he trailed leader @entity78 by four shots going into the final round , but four birdies in his first seven holes kept him in contention -- and three in the last four gave him his fifth victory at the event and first since 2009			1
