-- @entity1 had called it " unacceptable , " while @entity4 's president chimed in on the lack of engine noise and apparent " taxi driving " enforced by fuel restrictions -- but @entity9 delivered what its fans most want on sunday			1
the exhilarating sight -- if not sound -- of drivers overtaking and pushing the limits			0
while , like last season , there is clearly one dominant team -- this time @entity19 -- the introduction of new design rules and the smaller , yet seemingly more powerful turbo engines has added an element that had been lacking when @entity25 's @entity24 dominated so comprehensively in 2013			1
" i strongly dislike coming second to @entity27 , but on the other hand that was the most exciting race i 've ever had in my career , " @entity19 ' championship leader @entity28 said after being beaten into second place in @entity30 by @entity31			1
" today was a great day for the sport , and hopefully you had a lot of fun watching on television			0
" @entity31 triumphed by just over three seconds , having overtaken pole - sitting teammate @entity28 at the start but then being hauled back by the safety car following a collision between @entity43 ' @entity42 and @entity45 's @entity44			1
the @entity46 escaped unscathed despite his car 's spectacular somersault			1
@entity28 drove fantastically well , very fair , and it was hard to keep him behind at the end , " said 2008 world champion @entity31 , who moved up to equal 10th on the all - time victories list with the 24th checkered flag of his career			1
" i was on a knife edge the whole time			0
it was a relief when i crossed the line			0
" the childhood friends and rivals have dominated this season , winning all three races and claiming all three pole positions -- @entity28 now has an 11 - point advantage at the top , with @entity66 a further 22 back from @entity67 in third			2
it has been a big turnaround for @entity19 , which finished second in last year 's constructors ' standings -- a massive 236 points behind @entity24			1
but the @entity73 manufacturer has adapted best to the new rules -- reflected in the @entity19 - powered @entity75 claiming a surprise podium placing at @entity77 as @entity66 's teammate @entity78 came in third , some 23 seconds behind @entity28			1
@entity24 , struggling this season with its @entity81 engines , did manage fourth place as @entity83 upstaged @entity25 by overcoming the 10 - place penalty that put him 13th on the start grid			0
@entity66 was fifth in a notable double for @entity75 , ahead of his fellow @entity73 and four - time world champion @entity25 -- winner of the past two races in @entity30			1
@entity19 - powered @entity89 took seventh and eighth through @entity90 and @entity91 respectively			2
@entity90 's former @entity4 teammate @entity92 came home in a disappointing ninth , disconsolately punching the air in irony as he crossed the line ahead of new colleague @entity98			2
@entity99 , also powered by @entity19 , had a disappointing outing as 2009 world champion @entity101 retired two laps from the end in his 250th race while rookie @entity105 -- second in the season opener and ninth in @entity108 -- quit after 40 of the 57 laps			1
@entity42 was given a five - place penalty for the next race in @entity112 and three points against his @entity114 after hitting @entity44 on lap 41			0
@entity116 's @entity115 was given two penalty points -- a total of 12 means a one - race ban -- for ending the race of @entity44 's @entity45 teammate @entity121 , who has a five - place penalty for @entity112 after an infringement in saturday 's qualifying			1
the @entity9 caravan will head to @entity126 in two weeks with the sport 's chief executive @entity1 demanding changes after criticisms over the perceived lack of atmosphere at races			1
" people buying tickets are expecting to see what @entity9 used to be , and as i 've mentioned before , i 've had letters from promoters , " the 83 - year - old told reporters in the paddock before the @entity30 race , which was celebrating its 10th anniversary			1
" they 're all worried if they lose spectators then they are going to be in trouble			0
" what is important is that the teams know the problem , the engine manufacturers know the problem , and they 're trying to sort it			0
" @entity4 president @entity153 also voiced his concerns			0
" i do n't want to think of the decline of @entity9 , and if we look at it today , we have a race that is no longer @entity9 , " the @entity155 said before the gp			2
" we have to give back to @entity9 its characteristics			2
we can not have an economy formula			0
it has to be extreme , with racing from the first lap to the last			0
" @entity9 is also about the engine music -- not noise -- and we also have to make sure it is not too complicated with regard to the rules			2
" however , the head of motorsport 's governing body said the 2014 changes had been necessary due to " environment legislation " which was restricting the use of circuits for @entity9 , and said teams had to adapt to the new challenges			2
" if you ask @entity31 and @entity28 if they are driving like taxi drivers ... if you have an efficient car you do n't have any problem , " said @entity180 president @entity179 , formerly team boss at @entity4 when @entity182 was the dominant force of @entity9			1
" it seems @entity19 is stronger			0
i do n't have the power to say ' let 's slow them down			0
' if they are quicker than the others i think it is a challenge for the other teams to catch them			0
" it is completely unfair to punish a team who has been doing a better job			0
