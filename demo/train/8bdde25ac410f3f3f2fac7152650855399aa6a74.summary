-- gay slurs hurled by three figures in professional sports in the last month are more than just testosterone - fueled temper tantrums , some say			1
the behavior , they say , is symptomatic of a deeper problem and should be used as an opportunity to tackle homophobia in professional sports			2
" @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 are not any different from many people in our society who use offensive language like that on a daily basis , " said @entity11 of the @entity12 at @entity14 's @entity13			1
" these incidents provide a real opportunity for the @entity26 and @entity27 to take a strong stance against homophobia			2
" in april , a frustrated @entity29 star @entity15 laced a referee with an epithet that gays find offensive			1
@entity15 quickly apologized and was fined $ 100,000			1
@entity15 was apparently angry that the referee penalized him for a technical foul			1
in early may , @entity35 pitching coach @entity17 made national headlines for tossing anti-gay slurs at a group of fans in @entity40			2
he also made crude gestures at the fans , in full view of children who were in the crowd			2
after a short suspension , an emotional @entity17 apologized at a news conference			2
and last week , bombastic @entity48 center @entity16 was captured by television cameras lobbing a similar slur at a fan after his second foul in the game			1
@entity16 apologized right after the game and was slapped with a $ 50,000 fine			1
" when sports stars use slurs , it is especially damaging because their increased public profile means many more people are exposed			1
these people seem to have lost sight of the fact that in their prime , in pivotal moments in games , they are one of the most influential people in the world , " said former @entity26 player @entity61			1
@entity61 knows all too well about homophobia in sports			1
he is credited as being one of the few professional stars to admit he is gay			2
but @entity61 came out of the closet after he retired			1
he said he did not feel comfortable disclosing his orientation during his 5 - year @entity26 stint			2
@entity61 says he still remembers the pointed response from @entity26 star @entity78 that followed his disclosure			1
" first of all , i would n't want him on my team , " @entity78 told a radio host in 2007			0
" you know , i hate gay people , so i let it be known			0
i do n't like gay people and i do n't like to be around gay people			0
i do n't like it			0
it should n't be in the world or in the @entity90			0
" @entity78 later apologized for his statement -- but the sentiment persists among many athletes , @entity61 says			1
" sports stars need to remember that being a positive role model is as much a part of their job as making lay - ups , hitting home runs or scoring touchdowns , " he said			1
@entity101 , president and ceo of the @entity103 , says he had kept his sexual orientation secret throughout his long career			0
@entity101 came out when the @entity15 epithet caused a stir			1
he said @entity15 's slur solidified in his mind that he needed to go public			1
" well , the irony of the timing is it was the day before that i had been sitting in @entity112 , the ( @entity26 ) commissioner 's office , to kind of discuss this with him			0
and then the next night , @entity15 went off , " @entity101 told @entity0 's @entity116			1
" you know , i think it reinforced that probably it was time , because i think that will probably be remembered as a teaching moment			2
" while his disclosure has been received positively for the most part , @entity101 says is apprehensive about his future and feels that he is in uncharted territory			0
" i do n't know what my future is			0
i do n't know where my career is going to go , " he said			0
" i think that 's part of the big problem with players			0
there 's no example out there			0
no one has ever done it			0
no one really knows what 's going to happen			0
" the @entity26 recently released a pubic service announcement featuring players @entity142 and @entity144 about anti-gay language			0
" using gay to mean dumb or stupid ... not cool , " @entity142 says in the commercial that is running during the playoff games			0
" it is offensive to gay people , " @entity144 adds			0
but some say more needs to be done			0
" male professional sports do have an issue with homophobia , but so does society in general , " @entity11 , of @entity13 , said			2
" the @entity26 and @entity27 are great vehicles for educating folks about this issue and could really turn these negative events into a positive teachable moment			1

" it is especially damaging because of their increased public profile , " says @entity61
sports *leaders* can " turn these negative events into a positive teachable moment , " expert says
@entity15 was fined $ 100,000 for his statement
@entity48 center @entity16 was fined $ 50,000 for his slur
