editor 's note : this review may contain spoilers			2
( @entity4 ) -- you could sit through a year 's worth of @entity8 comedies and still not see anything that 's genuinely knock - your - socks - off audacious			2
but " @entity10 " ( opening today ) truly is			2
it 's the wildest screen comedy in a long time , and also the smartest , the most fearlessly inspired , and the snort - out - loud funniest			2
the movie opens with @entity13 at an airport , where a passerby says , '' hey , @entity13 , what up , man ? '' so you immediately know that he 's going to be playing a version of himself			1
in fact , everyone in the film is playing a version of him - or herself			1
@entity13 picks up his buddy @entity23 ( who 's less of a star than anyone here — a running gag ) , and after getting stoned , they head to a party at @entity31 's house			1
everyone from @entity33 to @entity34 is there , and what transpires looks so much like what you 'd expect a party with hip young actors and comedians to look like that it 's as if we 'd wandered into the ultimate episode of @entity45			2
the jockeying of movie - star egos , the drugs and sex ( @entity51 is the group 's libertine nerd ) , @entity13 and @entity31 brainstorming a sequel to @entity55 — it 's all cheekily plausible			1
then @entity13 and @entity23 venture out to a convenience store to feed their munchies , and they hear a crack , and blue light pours down from the heavens			1
it 's not just an earthquake — it 's the @entity65			0
the world is coming to an end ! the two hustle back to the party , where most of the guests flee ( or try to ) , and before long there are only five of them left in that house : @entity13 , @entity23 , @entity31 , @entity33 , and @entity74			1
for a moment , i feared that " @entity10 " might be a stunt that wears out its welcome in 10 minutes			0
but @entity13 , who co-wrote and codirected the film with @entity79 , does something incredibly sly			1
the movie does n't play the end of days for laughs			1
it 's an honest - to - @entity85 metaphysical disaster movie , a fusion of " earthquake , " " 2012 , " " @entity88 , " and " @entity89			0
" with the apocalypse played straight , the comedy can take off from it in a way that 's all the more explosive , as it was in the fantastic " @entity94			0
" sinkholes are sucking people into infernos , but inside @entity31 's house , the movie - star self - absorption gets raised to an insane new pitch of competitive backbiting			0
the interplay is so fast and obscene that you feel like you 're eavesdropping on the sorts of things comedians say to each other when they 're off camera			0
then @entity108 shows up , tossing insults like cherry bombs , and the hilarity just grows more scandalous			0
" @entity10 " pushes the envelope — a severed head becomes a soccer ball , and @entity31 and @entity115 turn a fight about masturbation into a confessional laugh riot			1
yet through it all , the movie is wonderfully deadpan about the '' reality '' it 's showing us			0
is @entity33 really a narcissist who wears his nice - guy facade like the diamond stud in his ear ? is @entity13 really a guilty sellout ? " @entity10 " has great fun tweaking their public images , even as it 's truly asking : do people like this deserve to go to heaven or hell ? the answer will crack you up and lift you up high			1
