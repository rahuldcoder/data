-- with president @entity3 's nomination tuesday , a federal appellate judge could become the first @entity7 @entity6 @entity5 justice and the third woman to serve on the high court			1
former attorney general @entity10 says some have concerns about @entity14 's philosophy			1
@entity14 , who is on the 2nd @entity6 @entity15 , was named a @entity6 @entity17 judge by president @entity18 in 1992 , and was elevated to her current seat by president @entity20			1
@entity14 , who is of @entity22 descent , rose from humble beginnings at a housing project in the @entity25 and went on to attend @entity26 and @entity27			1
@entity0 's @entity28 spoke with former @entity6 attorney general @entity10 about what it means to have a @entity7 judge nominated , what problems conservatives may have with her , and whether he believes she 's the right person for the job			1
here is an edited version of that interview : blitzer : let 's get to a former member of the @entity18 administration who has a unique perspective on @entity14 's nomination to the @entity5			1
that would be the former attorney general of the @entity6 , @entity10			1
he once was seen as a possible contender himself to be the first latino on the high court			0
attorney general , thanks very much for coming in			1
@entity10 : it 's good to see you , @entity28			1
blitzer : how close were you , in your mind ? did you ever find out how close you were to being president ( @entity55 ) @entity18 's nominee for the @entity5 ? @entity10 : i did n't concern myself , @entity28 , with respect to my status on the short list , so ... blitzer : but do you know if you were on the short list ? @entity10 : that 's a question , i think , that 's better posed to president @entity18			1
blitzer : but you -- but you know you were , right ? @entity10 : listen , i know that people -- people did consider me as a possible candidate for the @entity5			1
well , now there 's going to be -- well , there 's a nominee , already , who 's @entity7 , a woman			2
blitzer : how do you feel about that ? you 're the first @entity7 to serve as the attorney general of the @entity6			1
what do you think about her ? @entity10 : i think it 's a proud day for the @entity14 family			1
it 's a historic day for the @entity7 community			2
i do n't think that any gender group or ethnic group is entitled to representation on our courts			1
i do n't think that the outcome of a case should depend upon the ethnicity or gender of the judge , any more than the outcome of a case should depend on the ethnicity or gender of a prosecutor or defendant			2
but having said that , @entity28 , this is a powerful message , a powerful message of hope and opportunity of hope through this appointment , just like there 's a powerful message sent when an @entity108 is elected president or an @entity108 or @entity7 is appointed as attorney general of the @entity6			1
it 's a powerful message that a president listens to , and this president obviously did			0
blitzer : because that picture that we saw earlier at the @entity116 , the first @entity108 - @entity6 president now nominating the first @entity7 justice -- to become a @entity5 justice			0
that says a lot about what 's going on in our country right now			0
@entity10 : again , it says a lot about opportunities in our great country			2
obviously , this judge still needs to go through a confirmation process			0
there are questions , some concerns raised in certain quarters about her judicial philosophy , but that 's what the confirmation process is all about			1
and no nominee is entitled to a free confirmation process , an easy confirmation process			0
she will be fully vetted , as she should be , because this is a lifetime appointment to our nation 's highest court			2
blitzer : here 's what she said back in 2001 , and i 'll put it up on the screen : " i would hope that a wise @entity152 woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who has n't lived that life			2
" that 's generating some commotion out there			0
@entity10 : i 'm not sure what that -- what she was trying to say there			2
i think -- you know , i served on the @entity166			0
and there were times -- there were cases in which i had to interpret a statute			0
i did n't like the outcome based upon that interpretation as i read the statute , the intention of the state legislature , but i felt obliged by my oath of office to honor that intent of the legislature			0
i think it 's dangerous when judges impose their own personal views with respect to the outcome of a particular case			0
blitzer : did you -- when the president of the @entity6 says he wants something -- someone who 's empathetic , and has had real - world , real - life experiences , is that good or bad ? @entity10 : i think we all -- we 'd like to think that all of our government officials are good people , compassionate people			1
and obviously , someone with this kind of story makes a very attractive candidate in a confirmation process			0
but to say that you empathize with someone , i think it 's -- it 's very , very difficult to predict the outcome of a case based upon whether or not a judge feels good about a result			2
i think there ought to be predictability and certainty in the interpretation of our laws			0
i think that 's the number one requirement that a president should look for in the nomination of a @entity5 justice			0
blitzer : based on what you know , the fact that the first president @entity18 named her to the federal bench to begin with			0
then president @entity20 got her to the court of appeals			0
based on what you know about her , do you think she 's qualified to be a @entity5 justice ? @entity10 : i have no questions in my mind about her qualifications in terms of education , experience			1
a president is not required to nominate the most qualified person to the court			0
i think he 's obligated to nominate someone who is well qualified , and i think by any measure she is well qualified			0
i think there are legitimate questions about her judicial philosophy , and again , that will be something that ... will be examined in the confirmation process			1
blitzer : as a @entity7 , how worried are you that if @entity253 or conservatives go really hard against her , that would further alienate the @entity7 vote against the @entity253 in the years to come ? @entity10 : well , obviously , the @entity253 are very desirous of the @entity7 vote , but they have an obligation , a duty			2
they took an oath as well to the @entity261 , and they have an obligation to vet every nominee carefully , whether or not that nominee is @entity7 , and you know , white , @entity108 , male or female			0
they have an obligation , and i expect them to discharge that obligation			0
blitzer : how worried are you , switching gears for a moment , that the @entity276 lawyers who wrote those legal opinions authorizing enhanced interrogation , how worried are you that the system now will come down on them , either disbarment or worse ? @entity10 : what i worry about , @entity28 , is that good people , well - intentioned people serving in a historically difficult time , a dangerous time in our nation 's history , may be penalized for doing their best , simply providing the best legal advice that they can			1
i 'm afraid of the chilling effect that that 's going to have on future lawyers at the @entity276			0
blitzer : you were the @entity116 counsel at that time			0
this was before you became the attorney general			1
@entity10 : that 's correct			1
blitzer : and were you involved in some of those legal opinions early on ? @entity10 : well , what i can say is that i worked with the @entity276 ensuring that legal advice was provided			2
but at the end of the day , it 's the responsibility of the @entity276 to provide the legal guides on behalf of the executive branch			0
blitzer : so are you in any -- do you think -- are you afraid that you could be in any legal jeopardy right now ? @entity10 : @entity28 , i stand by my record			2
i did my best to defend our country during very difficult times , so i 'm proud of my service			0
attorney general , thanks very much for coming out			1
@entity10 : thank you , @entity28 .			2

former attorney general : no questions in my mind about her education , experience
@entity10 says some concerns raised about judge 's judicial philosophy
he says @entity14 's appointment , like @entity3 's election , provides hope
@entity330 : still , no gender or ethnic group is entitled to representation on our courts
