@entity0 voted for the first time in her life in @entity5 city elections last fall			1
this year , she moved from @entity7 to @entity8 , a few months ahead of the november presidential election , in which she 'd very much like to cast her ballot			2
@entity12 is a former felon , and in @entity8 , people convicted of violent felonies , drug crimes , and certain other offenses must wait for five years before even applying for a gubernatorial restoration of voting rights			1
that 's five years after serving your sentence , finishing supervised probation and paying all fines and restitution			0
and those five years have to be clean -- no misdemeanors or pending convictions , or the application is void			0
such laws -- which exist in various forms in 11 other states besides @entity8 -- mean that an estimated 5.8 million people do not have the right to vote , according to @entity34 , a non-partisan group that researches and tracks controversial issues			2
the @entity36 launched a nationwide campaign tuesday to restore voting rights for ex-felons , saying that state efforts to block such rights are thinly veiled attempts to suppress the black vote			1
@entity36 president and ceo @entity44 kicked off the campaign in @entity46 , which has the highest level of disenfranchisement in the country			1
" what this comes down to really is , do you think voting is a right or is it a privilege ? because if voting is a right , people who have paid their debt to society should be allowed to vote , " @entity44 said earlier tuesday on " @entity55			0
" in 2007 , then - gov. @entity61 of @entity46 , a @entity62 at the time , signed reforms to allow former felons who 'd completed their sentences to more easily get their voting rights restored			1
four years later , @entity67 gov. @entity67 reversed those reforms , imposing a five - to seven - year waiting period and a complicated application process to get civil rights restored			2
in issuing the new rules for voting rights for ex-felons , @entity67 said the changes " are intended to emphasize public safety and ensure that all applicants desire clemency , deserve clemency , and demonstrate they are unlikely to reoffend			1
" " it stands to reason that individuals who have committed serious violence or sexual offenses ; abused the privilege of holding public office ; endangered society with poisonous drugs ; or carried a firearm after they have been convicted should be required to attend a hearing and explain why their rights should be restored , " @entity67 said in a statement in march of 2011			2
according to a study of state data by the @entity94 and @entity95 , 7,000 people were removed from @entity46 's voter rolls in the first four months of this year for recent felony convictions			1
among those removed , 51 % are @entity100 and 17 % are @entity62			0
nationally , 38 % of the people disenfrachised due to felony convictions are african - american , according to the @entity103			0
the @entity104 said @entity46 has the nation 's largest share of disenfranchised voters , where nearly one out of every five black men overall is ineligible to vote			2
every vote counts in @entity46 , a heavily contested battleground in the 2012 elections and the pivotal player in the result of the 2000 elections , which was decided by 537 votes in favor of @entity118			2
another swing state crucial to the elections this year is @entity8 , where former felons who have served their sentences and paid all fines and restitution must wait " a minimum of two years for a non-violent offense or five years for a violent felony or drug distribution , drug manufacturing offense , any crimes against a minor , or an election law offense " before applying to have their voting rights restored			1
@entity0 was sentenced to 24 years in prison in 1994 for a crack cocaine conviction that she says was the result of her abusive relationship with a drug dealer			1
in 2000 , then - president @entity139 commuted her sentence to time served			0
but that was n't the end of her punishment			0
" one of the collateral consequences of having been incarcerated is losing my right to vote , " she told a @entity148 panel in @entity149 last week			0
an @entity36 delegation urged the @entity155 's special rapporteur on racism to investigate what it said were racially discriminatory election laws in the @entity160			1
not being able to vote " makes one feel inferior , " @entity0 told @entity55 tuesday			0
" you do n't want people that are trying to reintegrate , trying to live a better lifestyle , to feel this way , " she added			0
" it 's hard for me to be able to explain to my children why i 'm not able to vote when i pay taxes , and they see me working hard and doing things i should be doing as a citizen			0
" @entity0 said she applied in august for her voting rights to be restored in @entity8			1
she has not yet received a response to her request .			0

@entity0 was convicted of a first - time , non-violent drug offense in @entity8 in 1992
the @entity36 says state efforts to block ex-felons from voting is discriminatory
@entity46 has one of the toughest processes to restore former felons ' voting rights
