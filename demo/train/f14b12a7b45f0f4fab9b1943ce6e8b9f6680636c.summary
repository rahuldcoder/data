@entity0 , @entity1 -- want to boost your spending power ? try giving your wallet a break by shopping at a dollar store			1
@entity8 have embraced the four leading chains -- @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and the 99 ¢ only store -- in droves during the recession			2
this year , @entity10 's sales were up almost 10 percent quarter - over - quarter , and they 're opening 450 new stores , according to the @entity18			2
@entity12 , meanwhile , planned to open 235 new stores this year			2
and @entity11 's early 2009 numbers pointed to sales being up 6.5 percent year - over - year			0
but despite the booming sales , @entity23 ' @entity22 has taken a close look at this hot retail segment and found that not everything is a deal			0
before i tell you what they say to stock up on and what to pass on , i want to clarify something			0
there are important distinctions to note among the chains			0
@entity10 and @entity11 both price the majority of their items at $ 1 , but they also offer some merchandise at higher price points			0
@entity12 and the 99 ¢ only chain are the only true dollar stores where everything is $ 1 , with no exceptions			1
so what did @entity23 find ? @entity48 rounds , gift wrap , birthday candles , paper bags , composition notebooks , plastic cups , security envelopes , napkins , foam plates and tissue paper are among the best deals			1
yet they advised against buying jewelry ( too much lead content ) , electrical products ( possibly fake @entity61 labels ) , medication ( expired products ) and vitamins ( probably not to be from reputable sellers ) at any dollar stores			1
now , i 've routinely bought medication like ibuprofen at dollar stores and have not found it to be past expiration date			1
of course , some would argue that i can get a better deal on ibuprofen at a warehouse club			0
but unless you 're in constant pain , who can use all those 12 million pills in the bulk container before they expire ? ! the research that @entity23 did reminded me of a similar report in @entity87 several years ago			0
at that time , the women 's magazine compared four knockoff products from the dollar stores versus four brand name products purchased elsewhere			1
the products included generic glass cleaner , body lotion , dishwashing liquid and detergent			0
the brand name products were @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , and they proved to better than their generic counterparts			2
for example , a teaspoon of @entity101 washed 19 dishes , while a teaspoon of the dollar brand washed only six ! as for the detergent , the dollar brand failed to wash out a mustard stain that @entity102 did			1
so the message is , let the buyer beware at the dollar stores			1
certainly , there are some deals to be had , but you 've got to be picky .			0

recession has boosted spending at dollar stores
@entity48 rounds , gift wrap , birthday candles among the best deals
not all dollar stores are equal ; some have more *expensive* items
some knockoff products from dollar stores failed tests against brand names
