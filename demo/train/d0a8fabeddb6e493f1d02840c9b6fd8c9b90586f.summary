@entity0 , @entity1 -- it started when a friend handed her the book " @entity9 or the neighbors will hear , " about violence against women			1
" i took it home and did n't put it down all night , " @entity11 told me , laughing nervously and then tearing up , her voice quavering			1
" and i realized it was me			2
we just did n't talk about it back then ... i just thought i was the only one			2
" that was in the late 1970s , shortly after @entity18 -- a fiery 63 - year - old who looks like the @entity1 version of @entity21 -- moved to @entity0 , @entity1 , to escape an abusive husband who , at different points over years , held a gun to her head , beat her and , one time , sexually assaulted her			1
she called the cops on him twice , she told me , but he never was arrested or charged			0
the police told her maybe she should consider a divorce or that , when he used a gun , he was just " teasing " and it had gotten out of hand , she told me			0
@entity18 would go on to become a pioneer of the women 's rights movement in a state that needs it more than any other			1
@entity1 is estimated to have the highest rate of reported rape in the county , according to @entity44 crime data			1
the rate is three times the national average			2
state surveys show 37 % of women will face sexual violence ; and 59 % will suffer from threats , domestic abuse and / or sexual assault			1
because those numbers are still so high , @entity18 sometimes wonders if all her work to end violence against women here has been a waste of time			2
it has n't , of course			0
the results can be seen inside the walls of the @entity65 , or aware , shelter in @entity0 , which first opened in a two - bedroom house in the late 1970s and at its current location in 1985 -- a time when there were few if any women 's shelters in the state			1
they can be seen in the lives changed because she took battered women into her houseboat before there was any formal place for them to go			1
and they can be seen in @entity1 's @entity80 and @entity81 , which she helped lobby for and create , and which continues to fund violence prevention and treatment programs here			1
it 's the rest of the state that needs to step up			1
the lawless ' end of the land ' too many women are n't believed when they come forward to report rape and domestic abuse			1
too many offenders are n't prosecuted			0
( only 46 % of reported sexual assaults in @entity1 are referred for prosecution and 22 % result in a conviction , according to the @entity99			1
) too many families tolerate or just accept abuse and rape they see and hear in their own homes			2
and far too many communities remain virtually lawless			0
all that could change if the state would follow @entity18 's lead			1
her life story should be enough of a wake - up call for this state			2
@entity1 's pioneer woman grew up in @entity113 , @entity114 , about as far from @entity1 as an @entity115 could get			1
she was a beauty queen -- became miss @entity116 at age 17 , wearing a gown her mother made			0
but she remembers that night more for the violence			0
it was the first time her then - boyfriend gave her a black eye			0
he was jealous of the attention , she told me			0
but she stuck with him , thought she was in love			0
the rapist next door " i remember ... hiding , putting makeup on around my eyes , trying to avoid my mother and father for a few days , " she said			0
" it only escalated from there			0
she tried to leave and he came back for her , one time riding after her on a motorcycle , she said			0
she ended up moving to @entity1 to finally get away , for good			1
they were divorced by then , and a group of her friends drove up to the state on a bus and she followed with her 4 - year - old son , on a plane			2
" i lucked out , " she said			0
" it 's the best thing that ever happened to me			2
" shortly after she arrived in @entity0 , that 's when a friend gave her the book that would open up all her thinking -- make her realize that she had n't done anything to deserve being beaten and raped , that violence against women was a disease that grew from silence and oppression			1
she learned that @entity0 was not up to protecting its women ; the city had no 911 service , let alone a shelter for battered women			1
so she did something about it : she and a group of like - minded friends started housing survivors of rape and domestic violence in their homes			2
that 's when she started letting women stay in her tiny houseboat , which she rented because she could n't afford a home in picturesque @entity0			1
to hear her son , @entity18 , in his 40s , tell it , his mom was at this work virtually on her own , his whole life			0
" she worked pretty much all the time , " he told me			0
and he said he thinks now that their lives were at risk because of her advocacy			0
states where rape is most common her voice is one @entity1 did n't want to hear			1
@entity18 set up a hot line for victims and responded to some of the emergency calls herself			0
she remembers waking up in the middle of the night and throwing @entity18 in the car to go to a hospital with a rape kit , to be sure it was used			2
" unfortunately , the case never went anywhere , " she said			0
" i even remember ( police ) called her to take two lie detector tests to make sure she was telling the truth			0
" " we even did radical things like post pictures of known rapists in all of the bar bathrooms , " @entity18 told me , " because we could n't get the assistance we needed from the local law enforcement at the time			0
" when other survivors of violence were n't willing to speak up , @entity18 met with members of the state legislature			2
she said that sharing her story openly helped men who might otherwise ignore these issues pay attention and change laws			0
forcing that conversation may be @entity18 's greatest contribution			2
5 ways to help end rape in @entity1 " it 's now in the public eye , " she said			1
" people ca n't turn their heads any longer			0
they know it 's happening			2
" but she wrestles with her legacy			0
several years ago , she backed away from advocating for victims of rape and domestic violence			2
after several public officials and community pillars in @entity0 were outed as abusers , she became paranoid , she told me			1
she started thinking everyone she met was an abuser or rapist			0
" there is a blessing in not knowing how bad it is around you , except by picking up the paper and seeing it daily : a 30 - year - old man , a 45 - year - old woman , a 27 - year - old man have been arrested for domestic violence , " she said			0
talk to her about the statistics now -- that @entity1 is still @entity115 's rape capital -- and the life drains from her face as she says she 's not sure anything 's changed			1
@entity1 needs to prove her wrong			1
it just needs to wake up , like @entity18 did all those years ago			0
" violence inside the home , within the family , is not new , and because it is not new , it is not easy to see it for what it is , " @entity270 , a women 's rights activist in the @entity271 , writes in the book that changed the course of @entity18 's life back in the 1970s			1
" people have had lots of practice in ignoring it			0
they will turn a blind eye or cross the road			0
they will even , as one woman told women 's aid , turn up the tv to block out the shouting and sobbing next door so that they can no longer hear it			1
" turn down the tv , @entity1			1
and do it for @entity11			1
@entity1 faces its ' resident evil ' the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity298 .			1
