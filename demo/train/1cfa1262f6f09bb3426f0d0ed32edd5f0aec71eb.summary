-- if you were to ask a group of @entity3 or @entity4 whether it 's ok for police or soldiers to use rubber bullets against rock - throwing children , you would n't be surprised if they said , " absolutely not ! " they are well - known for their commitment to pacifism			1
but what if you were to put the question this way : " when soldiers are firing against demonstrators , would it be better if they used rubber bullets rather than metal ? " " obviously it is , " they would probably say , " but they should n't be firing at all in the first place ! " the @entity27 is well - known for having its own issues with rubber			1
the answer it traditionally gives to the use of condoms -- an answer that mystifies and outrages so many people , particularly in this age of hiv / aids -- is " absolutely not ! " so it caused quite a stir in a book - length interview published last week in which pope @entity41 seemed to give a different answer			1
he stood by his position that condom distribution was not the answer to the @entity37 epidemic , which could only really be dealt with by fidelity in marriage and chastity outside of it			1
however , he surprised many people by acknowledging that were a prostitute to use a condom to prevent infection , that should be seen as a step toward greater moral responsibility			1
but this different answer is not a sudden change of mind on the part of the @entity61 hierarchy			2
it is the answer to a different question			2
the pope was not asking himself whether it 's ok to use condoms			1
he was addressing the following question : " if someone has already decided to have sex outside a married relationship ( perhaps even outside a heterosexual relationship ) , is it better to do it with or without a condom ? " it 's obviously better to do it with a condom because , as the pope pointed out , the person is obliged in that situation not to risk infecting a partner or being infected			1
if the intercourse is heterosexual , the person is further obliged not to risk conceiving a child that will not be brought up in a stable family and might not see the light of day at all			0
though the @entity27 has always been clear in its position on the immorality of intercourse outside of marriage , pope @entity41 has done us all a favor by observing publicly that the use of a condom in such circumstances can be understood as a sign of a burgeoning moral awareness			1
it is this issue of responsibility that has always been the sticking point			0
people have presumed that in its condemnation of condom use , the @entity27 is somehow encouraging irresponsible , unprotected sex			1
but in fact it 's been discouraging everything except faithful monogamous sex			1
its teaching about artificial contraception has only ever been about marriage ; it has never had anything to do with any other kind of sexual activity			2
intercourse between husband and wife should always be open to conceiving new life ; therefore , contraception was considered wrong because it was seriously unnatural			0
the problem is that all condom use came to be thought of as absolutely wrong , not just wrong in marriage			1
if using condoms were absolutely wrong , then it must be wrong for gay men to use them , too			2
if it were absolutely wrong , then it must be wrong for fornicating teens to use condoms , too			2
a disastrous misunderstanding ! however , church authorities have usually avoided the more complex explanations -- no " maybe , " no " in certain conditions			0
" that 's because they believe that the public just wants a simple " yes " or " no " -- and preferably a " yes			0
" they fear that anything other than an absolute " no " will be interpreted as an absolute " yes			0
" and , it should be added , they have unjustly censured highly qualified moral theologians who have dared to say " maybe			0
" that a pope has now introduced a " maybe " has evoked a flustered reaction			0
official clarifications are given that then need further explanation			0
churchmen argue over whether what he said is anything new , whether it represents a major policy change or whether it is just really the same old line			0
in many respects , it is an old line			0
but the old line was never the simple " no " it has so long been thought to be			0
the catholic moral tradition has always been much more sophisticated than that			1
the pope 's statement only seems new			2
since the 1968 encyclical letter @entity160 , which reaffirmed the teaching that artificial means of contraception was not acceptable in a marriage , @entity159 has been trying to hold the line by refusing to deal with " what if ... " and " perhaps			0
" in the @entity61 tradition , it has always been assumed that those inevitable questions would be dealt with in private conversation between priests and people			0
yet for many , that big public " no " made them hesitate to engage in such conversations , and the @entity27 has not shown itself adept at handling the public debate about condoms and @entity177			1
when the pope commented during his @entity181 journey last year that condoms were not the solution to @entity37 in @entity181 , he was seen to be just giving the same old knee - jerk catholic moral response , so out of touch with reality			1
yet his comment was based on other observations of a social and scientific nature , and it is to this that he returned briefly in the interview which has caused such a stir			0
he acknowledges something that has been obvious all along in the @entity61 tradition : it is rare to find a moral question that is a simple issue of " yes " or " no , " so we need to learn moral reasoning and responsibility , not just blind obedience			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			2

@entity204 says @entity27 has long had an answer on condom use : " absolutely not "
he says pope surprised by saying prostitutes ' condom use more morally responsible
church teaches : no sex outside marriage , no condoms ; new comments aim at *unmarried* sex
@entity204 : @entity222 's comments *reflect* a more sophisticated strain of catholic moral tradition
