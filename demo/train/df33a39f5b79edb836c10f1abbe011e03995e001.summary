@entity23 : how you can help @entity16 said the @entity3 will have to go back to donors and ask for more food			2
but the health sector is also an area of concern			0
" what happens during famine is that people die of epidemic diseases like measles and malaria ... and if we ca n't support health activities then we will lose a lot of lives unnecessarily			1

the @entity100 announced thursday an additional $ 17 million for the crisis , with $ 12 million designated for @entity1			1
