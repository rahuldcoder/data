-- " can you possibly let me have , at any rate , five hundred dollars to keep us out of the poor house ? " these are not the words you expect to hear from a man who designed one of the world 's most famous golf courses			1
dr. @entity12 , the brains behind @entity15 's revered contours and curves -- elegantly showcased each year by the masters -- died pleading poverty in 1934 and begging for his fee			1
he never even saw his finished work before his death , which came less than three months before the first masters tournament was held			1
" i have been reduced to playing golf with four clubs , " he wrote in a letter to @entity15 , recorded in " @entity24 , " a book by @entity26 commissioned by the club			1
" i am at the end of my tether , no - one has paid me a cent since last june , we have mortgaged everything we have and have not yet been able to pay the nursing expenses of my wife 's operation			0
" @entity12 , a physician turned golf architect , had embarked on a pilgrimage that had taken him from a modest town in northern @entity43 to the pacific coast in @entity45			1
his journey incorporated a stint in the @entity48 , which influenced his underpinning principles of course design , and saw his work evolve during the boom and bust years of the 1920s			1
by the time he was enlisted to build a championship course for all of @entity56 by its biggest sports star of the age , @entity12 was the preeminent golf architect of his time			1
@entity61 had won the grand slam as an amateur in 1930 -- capturing all four major tournaments in the calendar year -- before he stunned the public by announcing his retirement aged just 28			2
he determined to construct an exclusive golf course in the sun - blushed south of the @entity56 that would offer him twin benefits : sanctuary from his fame and a healthy stream of income			0
but though @entity61 declared himself delighted with the finished product , and its architect trumpeted @entity15 as his finest creation , @entity12 was almost destitute by the time he died			1
he halved his fee to $ 5,000 in a bid to be paid quickly , but clawed back just $ 2,000 , with several other golf courses also slow to settle their debts			0
it was symptomatic of the financial difficulties @entity15 encountered in its fledgling years , exacerbated by the @entity86 , a fact that seems inconceivable given the club 's towering strength in the present day			1
" @entity15 struggled a lot in the early years and found it very hard to attract members they wanted , " @entity89 , editor of @entity91 , told @entity0			1
" they were really struggling for money			0
@entity12 did n't get full payment paid for his work at @entity15 -- until he died he was writing letters asking perhaps they could send part of the fee			1
" @entity12 divorced his first wife and was living what would appear to be an expensive lifestyle in @entity45			2
he was basically bankrupt when he died			0
" there were a lot of golf architects from that time who were the same			0
most seemed to be terrible businessmen and there were a few bad habits like too much booze flying around			0
" humble beginnings @entity12 's portrait still watches over the course where his maverick design ideas were first put into practice over 100 years ago			1
despite the odd tweak , @entity119 -- just outside the city of @entity121 in the north of @entity43 -- still boasts many of the original characteristics conceived by the @entity125			2
as @entity129 , secretary of the @entity130 , told @entity0 , the physician 's long - held affection for the game even permeated some of his diagnoses			2
" how frequently have i , with great difficulty , persuaded patients who were never off my doorstep to take up golf , and how rarely , if ever , have i seen them in my consulting rooms again ! " @entity12 is reported to have proclaimed			1
this love of golf sparked an interest in course architecture after a period serving during the @entity48 , between the @entity141 and the @entity142 , at the turn of the 20th century			0
" the attitude of the boers towards camouflage got him interested in disguise and trickery , " @entity129 explains			0
" people suggest this is the reason he came back after the war and took an interest in golf design			2
" when a group of businessman joined together in 1907 to build @entity156 , @entity12 presented his designs and had them rubber - stamped by @entity158 -- another famed architect of the age who worked as a consultant on the project			1
@entity12 's fundamental belief was that a good golf course should provide a stern test for a good player but not prove impossible for average players			1
also included in his manifesto was an insistence that a player should be required to utilize a variety of shots to prosper and that every hole should have a different character where possible			0
among the more eccentric attributes listed was the suggestion that though the course should be sufficiently undulating , there should be no hill climbing , and that a complete absence of irritation caused by looking for lost balls was preferable			0
" @entity156 is very proud indeed because we have the original @entity185 design and we are very proud to introduce people to it , " @entity129 says			0
" @entity12 was a pioneer and went on to become one of the best known architects of his time			2
he 's become much more famous after his death and the golfing public have realized what great courses he 's made			0
" there are a lot of the original @entity185 characteristics on show at @entity198			0
we try our best when we restore the course or renovate course to keep to the original design of which we have a copy			0
" @entity15 @entity12 had carved a formidable reputation for himself by the time he left for the @entity56 in 1926			1
but it was his work on the @entity45 coast that would pique the interest of @entity61 and lead to his most memorable tender -- designing @entity15			1
many believe @entity12 's true masterpiece to be @entity213 , which he designed to complement its proximity to the rugged @entity216 coastline			1
by the time @entity61 had completed his first round on the @entity218 he vowed to employ @entity219 to build his very own course			2
it seemed the logical choice , given how closely their vision for the ideal golf course was			0
" we believe that no good golf hole exists that does not afford a proper and convenient solution to the average golfer and the short player , as well as to the more powerful and accurate expert , " @entity61 was reported as saying			1
but by the time $ 100,000 had been spent transforming an @entity15 fruit plantation into a golf course , the political and financial landscape had changed dramatically thanks to the stock market crash of 1929			2
the exuberant flourishes on show via a series of elaborate bunkers at @entity213 and another of @entity12 's fabled courses -- @entity243 in @entity244 -- gave way to a more modest design in which contour was king			2
" originally , @entity15 was light on bunkers -- it has many more today than it used to have , " says @entity249			0
" @entity15 was one of the very last things @entity12 did before he died and it seems he was moving away from those flashy bunkers			1
" he was working in a style that was appropriate of the era of depression when @entity15 was built			0
it was n't about sand or water -- what defined it were the contours of the land			0
" you can take a flag stick and put in a flat area and it 's a very easy golf hole ; you can put it behind a little hump and it 's an almost impossible golf hole			0
" the genius of @entity15 in those early years of struggle , the notion of @entity15 preparing to host the 78th installment of the masters in 2014 would have seemed quite fanciful			1
as @entity26 reports in " @entity24 , " let alone having the funds to pay @entity12 for his design , the club could barely cover its staff 's $ 200 weekly wage bill in the early 1930s			2
the idea to create a yearly tournament , initially called the @entity280 , helped stave off the threat of financial ruin and generated plenty of interest when @entity61 came out of retirement to play in the first one			0
but what really catapulted the club into the public 's consciousness was @entity293 's " shot heard around the world " during the 1935 event			0
the @entity56 was trailing the leaders by three shots when his double eagle on the par - five 15th hole helped him cut the deficit with one stroke , paving the way for his eventual win in a playoff			0
that landmark moment is testament to the principals upon which @entity12 's design was built			2
various tweaks over the years have stripped many of his original features from the course , most of them dictated by the modern player 's ability to hit the ball over a hundred yards further than their predecessors			0
but as @entity26 wrote : " @entity12 's and @entity61 ' ideas about golf course design continue to define the masters in ways that modern golf fans may not fully appreciate			1
" the pair 's commitment to break from the culture of golf design at the time -- which penalized poor shots harshly -- has engendered some of the greatest finishes in major golf			0
as @entity26 makes clear , the plentiful birdie and eagle opportunities down the closing stretch discourage any conservatism , as anyone in with a sniff of winning charges for the finish line			0
but it 's not just at @entity15 that @entity12 's legacy is felt -- an estimated 100 clubs as far afield as @entity342 and @entity343 have been touch by his hand			1
" @entity12 is undoubtedly one of the most important figures in terms of the evolution of golf course design , " @entity249 says			1
" @entity15 , @entity213 and @entity243 are three courses that would typically be in the top 10 in the world in most rankings , and the fact all three courses have @entity12 's footprint is pretty impressive			1
" @entity12 may be long gone , but he lives on in the soul of golf courses the world over			2

@entity12 , a physician turned golf architect , designed famed @entity15 course
the @entity125 was enlisted to help by @entity61 , a *multiple* golf champion of the 1920s
@entity12 never received full payment for his work and died before first masters was held
many of his design principles still permeate the course despite many changes over the years
