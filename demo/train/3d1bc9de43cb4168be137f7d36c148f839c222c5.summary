-- if the confirmation process for @entity3 , president @entity4 's nominee for attorney general , gets significantly delayed , the reason will be pure politics			1
some @entity10 , anticipating the day in january when they will have majority control of the chamber , are calling for a moratorium on new appointments until the new @entity13 is seated			0
it 's likely to be the first in a series of skirmishes between @entity4 and the leadership on @entity19			2
within hours of @entity3 's nomination , the right - wing @entity21 website ran an erroneous story slamming @entity3 for supposedly representing ex-president @entity24 during the long - ago inquiry into the @entity27 land deal -- but later had to post a correction for failing to recognize that @entity24 's defender was , in fact , a different person named @entity3			1
the haste with which conservatives began attacking @entity3 suggests she will be in for a tough slog during the nomination process			1
but while the politics may slow her confirmation , there 's no question that the tough - as - nails prosecutor is ready for the top job at the @entity42			2
any rival candidates the @entity44 might put forward will have a hard time demonstrating prowess equal or superior to @entity3 's in the crucial areas of prosecuting lawbreakers involved in organized crime , corporate theft , political corruption and threats to national security			1
@entity3 served two stints as the @entity55 attorney in charge of @entity58 's @entity57 , which includes most of @entity58 ( @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 ) as well as suburban @entity62			2
the office is often overshadowed by the neighboring @entity64 , which covers @entity65 and brings high - profile @entity67 prosecutions			2
while her flashier colleague in the @entity64 , @entity70 , gives speeches , holds frequent press conferences and has several press officers , @entity3 rarely holds forth in public and reportedly spent months without a press aide after the sole staffer in charge of public outreach retired			0
but @entity3 did much to put the @entity57 on the map			2
she mounted successful prosecutions that broke the back of @entity81 , a murderous gang that preys on immigrant communities ; convicted the underboss of the @entity84 ; and even revived an old @entity86 case by arresting five aging suspects from the all - but - forgotten @entity89 heist of 1978 , immortalized in the movie " @entity91			0
" @entity67 physically falls outside @entity3 's jurisdiction , but she mounted major cases against global financial giants engaged in wrongdoing			1
in 2012 , she won a record $ 1.9 billion in fines and penalties from @entity98 , a @entity99 bank , for a wide range of violations , including laundering more than $ 800 million for @entity103 drug gangs and illegally doing business with customers in @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
@entity3 's office also participated in the pursuit of @entity111 for its actions that contributed to the mortgage crash of 2008 -- an investigation that led to a $ 7 billion settlement			2
and @entity3 has taken on public corruption cases involving members of @entity58 's power elite			1
she convicted @entity119 , the former majority leader of the @entity13 , on corruption charges , calling him " a thief in a suit " the day he was hauled off to serve a five - year prison sentence			0
she is currently prosecuting state sen. @entity124 , and earlier this year indicted @entity55 rep. @entity125 on 20 counts including fraud , embezzlement and perjury			0
but @entity3 's best - known attack on public corruption came more than a decade ago , when she was part of the team that prosecuted cops who attacked and brutally sodomized a suspect , @entity136 , in the back room of a @entity59 precinct house			1
the prosecution ended in a guilty plea by the main perpetrator , officer @entity141 , who is serving a 30 - year sentence			0
in addition to rounding up shady pols , violent cops and @entity67 cheats , @entity3 took on the all - important issue of national security in the harrowing case of @entity150 , a terrorist who drove explosives from @entity152 to @entity58 with the intent of setting them off in the subways			1
@entity150 almost pulled off the horrific attack -- he was stopped on the @entity157 , minutes from @entity65 -- but ended up pleading guilty and cooperating with the government			0
( he has n't been sentenced yet , but faces up to two life sentences for his crimes			0
) all in all , an impressive body of work -- one that @entity3 compiled with a professional modesty that is rare in @entity58 's tough , competitive legal and political circles			1
she will now find herself caricatured and criticized by power brokers in @entity166 who are determined to hamstring the president			0
one likely avenue of attack is @entity3 's time in the private sector : between 2001 and 2009 , she worked as a corporate attorney specializing in compliance work for big banks and briefly served on the board of the @entity177			1
" she swims in the same pool as the moneyed elite , and her actions do n't pressure them too deeply , " writes @entity178 in salon , echoing the oft - heard complaint that even multibillion - dollar settlements of the kind @entity3 negotiated rarely result in any specific person going to prison			0
" it 's just not that likely @entity3 would have the will to crack down on malfeasance in the executive suites , which could implicate her colleagues and friends , " writes @entity178			0
" it 's not corruption , more like mindshare			0
" that sort of criticism unites left - of - center @entity200 activists and conservatives who -- determined to find fault with anything @entity4 does -- accuse the @entity207 of crony capitalism and aim special venom at @entity211 secretary @entity210 ( whose rise to his pre-treasury job of president of the @entity177 was aided by @entity3 ; as a board member , she cast a vote to give @entity210 the post )			1
so @entity4 's nominee is in for a wave of criticism that might drag confirmation proceedings into 2015			1
we shall see if @entity3 -- who has locked up enough terrorists , gangsters and political crooks to fill a few subway cars -- has the grit and gumption to master political combat inside the @entity230 the way she has mastered legal battle in the courtroom .			2

@entity235 : ag nominee @entity3 faces political *hurdles* on way to confirmation
conservatives attack her to hurt @entity4 , he says ; some on the left say she 's cozy with @entity67
he says she 's successfully prosecuted organized crime , corporate and political corruption
louis : she put would - be terrorist in jail ; confirmation process will be new test of her grit
