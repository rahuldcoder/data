@entity0 -- welcome to the chaotic @entity2			1
two unions -- representing nearly 20,000 @entity2 employees -- recently joined forces to publicly oppose the @entity7 immigration reform bill from the so - called " @entity8			1
" news : @entity10 approves immigration legislation the coalition represents 12,000 employees who are responsible for issuing documents that allow some immigrants to legally stay in the @entity16 and 7,700 agents charged with deporting illegal immigrants out of the country			2
together , the unions claim that the bill would weaken public safety			1
what makes this situation awkward is that president @entity25 and homeland security secretary @entity26 have given tacit support to the @entity7 immigration reform bill			1
@entity25 has said that a pathway to citizenship must be included in any reform proposal			1
and as recently as last month , @entity32 press secretary @entity31 said that @entity32 staffers had months ago huddled with the eight senators to help draft the legislation			0
as an additional wrinkle , many of these @entity2 employees who oppose the bill would be charged with helping to implement it , either by reviewing the applications of undocumented immigrants who would be seeking legal status or deporting those who did n't qualify for it			1
how that will ultimately work out is anyone 's guess			2
some of this sounds familiar			0
before the unions took on the @entity7 bill , they launched a rebellion closer to home			1
in june 2011 , @entity56 director @entity55 fired off an internal memorandum -- the " @entity55 memo , " as it became known -- to all directors , agents and general counsel in the agency 's field offices			1
in the memo , @entity55 advised the field personnel that they " may " exercise discretion and show leniency toward some illegal immigrants by weighing certain factors			0
they included the length of time the person had lived in the @entity16 , whether the person arrived as a child , whether the person was pursuing an education , etc. the @entity55 memo was heralded by immigration reform advocates as a major breakthrough			1
and yet , how did some in the field respond to the memo ? according to more than a dozen immigration attorneys i interviewed back then and many others i saw quoted elsewhere , they ignored it			2
and neither @entity55 nor his higher - ups , i.e. @entity88 and @entity25 , did anything to bring people back in line			1
i suspect that the reason for this hands - off approach was that the @entity56 agents , by racking up deportations , were helping the administration meet its goal of deporting people -- which it has done at a rate of more than 1,000 per day			1
the high numbers were necessary so that the administration could portray itself to @entity103 and the @entity16 people as tough on immigration enforcement			2
in october 2011 , just four months after the @entity55 memo was issued , @entity88 delivered a speech at @entity107 in which she boasted that the @entity2 was on track to set a new record for deportations in the 2011 fiscal year			1
and in fiscal 2012 , it broke that record again			0
at this rate , by the end of 2013 , the administration will have deported 2 million people			0
those figures make the claims of @entity121 , the head of the @entity122 ( the 7,700 - member deportation agents ' union ) , all the more ridiculous			1
@entity121 told the @entity124 : " this department under this administration is doing anything and everything they can not to arrest any alien in the interior of the @entity16			0
" @entity121 should tell that to 10 - year - old @entity131 who , next month , will be spending @entity133 without her father , @entity134 , who was deported in january			2
in a video testimonial on behalf of the immigrant advocacy group @entity137 , the @entity16 - born @entity131 explains how -- when a judge ordered her father removed from the country -- she could n't stop crying			2
she goes on to say : " my life has changed without my father			0
since he 's been gone , i miss him every day			0
every morning when i wake up , i wonder why they did n't let him stay here			0
why do they have to be so cruel to the families that are here ? " that 's a really good question			0
this administration has been excessively cruel to illegal immigrants and their families			0
and , worse , it has n't been willing to confess to the crime			0
instead , it has led us to believe that its record number of deportations are partly the result of low - level agents and their supervisors going rogue and refusing to use discretion to the point where some of those being deported should n't be			1
is that really what 's happening ? @entity88 has said all along she wants to remove illegal immigrants , more and more every year			0
that 's what the low - level ice agents were doing			2
so maybe they were n't being disobedient			0
maybe , in trying to be both tough and compassionate , the entire administration is being duplicitous			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			2

@entity178 : two @entity2 unions now publicly oppose proposed immigration reform
he says this " rogue - *ish* " *behavior* awkward for president @entity25 , who supports reform bill
@entity25 turned blind eye to *zealous* deportation , even when it *flouted* @entity192 , he says
@entity178 : deportation - happy @entity56 officials no more " rogue " than the president 's *policies*
