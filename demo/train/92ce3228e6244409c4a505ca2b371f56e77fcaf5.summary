-- in kindergarten , @entity1 came home sobbing one day because another boy at school had told him that he had a peanut , and that he was going to force @entity1 to eat it			2
@entity1 , now 7 , is allergic to peanuts and tree nuts , said his mother , @entity10 of @entity11 , @entity12			2
in reality , the taunting boy did not have a peanut , but @entity1 did n't know that -- he just knew that eating a peanut could make him stop breathing			2
it 's hard for parents of food - allergic children to keep them safe at school when there are so many opportunities to eat snacks and meals with unsafe ingredients			1
for some kids , just touching a certain food or inhaling particles of it could cause a reaction			1
but on top of the safety question is a social one			2
a study released last week suggests that almost half of children who have food allergies have been bullied -- sometimes by having food thrown at them			1
" clearly , it 's an issue for these school - aged children in terms of how they interact with their peers , " said dr. @entity42 , director of @entity43 of @entity44			2
" immediately , when there 's a diagnosis of food allergy , there 's a little bit of a stigma			1
" the new study furthers the mounting evidence that many kids with food allergies may endure social ostracism while also trying to eat safely			1
a 2010 study in the journal @entity63 said that 35 % of kids over age 5 with food allergies have endured bullying , teasing or harassment			1
parents of children with food allergies reported in the study that these incidents -- both physical and verbal -- happened because of food allergies			1
food allergy is a growing problem in young people			1
as many as 8 % of children in the @entity78 have at least one food allergy , according to research data			1
there is no cure for food allergies			1
the only way to stop a life - threatening reaction , called anaphylaxis , is an epinephrine auto - injector , which allergists recommend that everyone with severe food allergies should carry			1
allergists offer skin or blood tests to see what specific foods may cause reactions , but they can not know how severe those reactions will be -- some people may have only mild symptoms , while others may stop breathing			2
how to ensure no schoolchild dies of an allergy attack negotiating school safety @entity1 's family moved nearly 30 miles from @entity105 , @entity12 , to @entity106 , @entity12 , when @entity1 was in kindergarten , so that they could live in a school district with some peanut - free accommodations			1
@entity112 products are n't sold at lunch at @entity1 's school , said @entity1			2
when @entity116 learned about the peanut taunting incident , she went to see the school principal			2
the result was that the other boy , who had also been bullying other kids , was moved to a different classroom			1
at the bus stop , @entity1 met the woman partly responsible for food allergy awareness at @entity1 's school : @entity126 , whose 11 - year - old daughter @entity127 is allergic to peanuts , soy and various kinds of beans			1
@entity127 is the only one of three siblings who has food allergies ; so is @entity1			1
when @entity127 was in first grade , she had to eat her lunch in the principal 's office on days that the school served peanut butter , to avoid a reaction from coming into contact with it			2
this solution was not optimal , in @entity144 's view			2
she petitioned the school district to stop serving peanut products , and was successful			0
like @entity1 , @entity127 also experienced bullying because of her allergy			1
a boy would often chase @entity127 around with peanut butter in hand -- once , he touched her face with it , making her break out in hives			0
she only told her parents a couple of months after it stopped happening			0
these days , she does n't get picked on that way , @entity144 said			0
" i think she can , kind of , stand up for herself now , and will stand up for herself now , " @entity144 said			0
standing up to other adults @entity144 was surprised by the negative reactions reflected in the @entity0 reader comments about provisions for allergic kids in schools			1
in a story about the recent bullying study , user " @entity168 " wrote , in response to one reader , " how about you keep your sickly kid home ? that is what homeschooling is for			0
(...) we do n't have to accommodate your sick kid			0
" and " lorie " wrote , " many allergies can be life threatening			1
it is completely unfair and ridiculous to expect 400 other families to change their eating habits because you ca n't teach your kid not to touch someone else 's food			1
" these sentiments were also seen on the comment board on a 2010 story about food allergy bullying			1
at that time , @entity144 chimed in explaining @entity127 's school 's situation and adding , " my only thought is this , teaching children compassion for others is a good thing			0
and frankly , it seems a lot of adults that have made comments on here could use a little compassion too			0
' @entity144 has not felt that level of backlash from her efforts to keep @entity127 safe in her own community			0
a few parents have made remarks of the " why do we have to accommodate your daughter ? " variety , but generally everyone has been kind and supportive			0
" we 're talking about life and death here , " says @entity144			0
" if it were their child 's life , they would do everything they could to make sure their child 's life is protected			0
" making people understand communication with teachers , administrators , coaches , and the school nurse is key to ensuring that a food - allergic child does well , in terms of staying safe from allergens and psychologically speaking , @entity42 said			1
it 's also important to talk to a child about bullying , which can have serious psychological consequences , such as anxiety , @entity42 said			1
it 's harder to get teenagers to not take risks when it comes to avoiding problem foods and always carrying the epinephrine auto - injector , @entity42 said			0
" unfortunately the adolescent and child psyche is very sensitive to what people think and say and do , " he said			0
@entity116 is proactive about getting @entity1 's peers to understand his situation			0
every school year , on the first day , @entity116 takes a book called " @entity256 the @entity257 : @entity258 of @entity259			0
" the teacher reads this book to the children in the class so that they better understand what it means to have food allergies			1
she also brings allergy - safe treats to keep in the classroom so that @entity1 can have them if someone brings in unsafe sweets to celebrate a birthday			1
he carries an epinephrine auto - injector with him			0
" school is the scariest thing for me because a lot of people just do n't understand how serious it could be , " @entity1 said			0
@entity144 also has a routine for the beginning of @entity127 's school year : talking to the teacher about foods and determining where the epinephrine auto - injector should be kept			0
the classroom policy is that if kids ate peanuts for lunch , they are supposed to wash their hands			2
she and her husband @entity291 told their son @entity292 , who is @entity1 's age , to keep an eye out for @entity1 when they were attending the same school -- to tell a teacher if he were being teased			0
@entity292 and @entity1 are still friends			0
" i just did n't want anyone picking on him and if you have friend who will stand up for you , it makes a big difference , " @entity144 said			0
food allergy treatment shows promise a table of their own ? when it comes to what the best course of action is in terms of protection from allergens , the plan should be individualized , @entity42 said			1
you want to shield children from harm , but you also want to let kids be kids , he said			2
the @entity116 moved to @entity11 in may			0
at @entity1 's new school , there is a special table where children with common allergies can -- in theory -- sit together for lunch , isolated from kids who bring food that would be unsafe for the allergic group			1
@entity1 sat at the table for the first couple of days of school this year , alone			0
back that the regular lunch table , @entity1 takes several precautions			0
he owns his own lunch box and does n't put food on the table			2
he has antibacterial napkins so he can wipe contaminants off the area where he sits			0
and he knows what peanut butter looks like and smells like , so he can avoid it			0
however , @entity1 said she believes @entity1 's school can do more to raise awareness and practice caution regarding food allergies			1
" i 'm going to have to be the @entity126 in this school , and go in and make it known that they have to do a little bit more to protect these kids , " @entity1 said			2
when @entity355 is dangerous for kids does your child have food allergies ? what 's your strategy for allergy protection at school ?			1

studies show that many kids with food allergies are bullied
about 8 % of @entity78 kids have at least one food allergy
