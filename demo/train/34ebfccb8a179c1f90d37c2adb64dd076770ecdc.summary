-- issues with its planes ' emergency exit slides prompted @entity5 to put most of its fleet out of service friday , wreaking havoc with its flight schedule as the carrier rushed to shuffle passengers and gets its aircraft in compliance			1
in a press release , @entity5 explained that a " compliance issue " on its @entity22 planes prompted it to order the " immediate inspection and overhaul " of most of its emergency slides			1
that left all 52 of @entity5 's @entity22 planes out of service at one point , though by late afternoon 18 of those aircraft plus its six @entity29 jetliners and three @entity30 were operational			1
this forced @entity5 to juggle its schedule , pushing back 16 flights to saturday , canceling two altogether and causing various delays , according to airline spokesman @entity35			0
after all this , 103 of @entity5 's 121 flights friday eventually headed to their destinations			0
the headaches began monday , when smoke detectors went off on an @entity5 flight destined for @entity43 , @entity44 , as it was taxiing from the terminal to the runway at @entity48 ' @entity47			1
the pilot decided to evacuate the 144 passengers and six crew members using the aircraft 's emergency exit slides -- something that they did successfully , said @entity35			2
when reviewing this incident , @entity5 officials noticed a discrepancy between its practice of overhauling its @entity22 slides every three years with the manufacturer and @entity29 's recommendations -- which @entity5 views as requirements -- that it happen every year			1
" that meant we were not in compliance , so we took every aircraft out of service , " @entity35 said , insisting there was never an indication any slides were unsafe or not working properly			2
this process began overnight thursday			0
initial checks revealed that 14 of the company 's md - 80s were compliant ( because they had gotten new slides , four for each plane , within the past year ) and could fly , according to @entity35			1
by saturday -- typically a light day for @entity5 , which caters largely to leisure travelers going to and from mid- and small - sized airports to vacation destinations like @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 -- 22 md - 80s should be operational			1
" our best guess is that ... by the end of the month , everything will be back to normal , " said @entity35			0
" but passengers will not see disruptions sooner than that , hopefully			0
" in fact , the airline spokesman says all flights should head off fine saturday , as @entity5 uses its full available fleet as well as aircraft contracted from other carriers			2
but that may not be the case sunday and monday , two of the airlines ' busiest days of the week			0
any passengers affected then or on any other day by the issue ( including friday ) will get compensated with anything from a $ 100 voucher for delays under four hours to a refund and $ 200 voucher for those on rescheduled flights			0

a smoke detector goes off an an @entity5 flight , and all use slides to evacuate safely
@entity5 then notices its @entity22 planes ' slides were *n't* being overhauled *regularly* enough
all 52 of its md - 80s ( out of *61* planes total ) are immediately taken out of service , checked
@entity5 is *steadily* making more planes operational , as well as chartering other aircraft
