all eight republicans on the @entity3 voted " no " thursday , while all the 10 majority @entity2 supported the measure that would provide equal federal benefits to legally married same - sex couples			1
democrats and gay rights advocates hailed the vote as historic in the continuing effort to legalize same - sex marriage and end separate treatment for legally married same - sex couples			1
