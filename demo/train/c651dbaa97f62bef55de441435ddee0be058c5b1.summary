every morning , my children have to enter their preparatory school in @entity4 through a door that is inches thick			2
they and tens of thousands of other @entity7 children across the continent have to pass by police officers with armed assault rifles and high walls laced with barbed wire			2
even if there 's the suspicion of an impending attack , classes can be canceled and people are told to stay away from noticeably @entity7 institutions			0
after the recent attacks in @entity21 , the @entity19 was closed for sabbath services for the first time since the end of the @entity25			0
indeed , the situation has become so dire that @entity28 prime minister @entity27 has called on @entity7 in @entity29 to emigrate to @entity28			1
while i understand this sentiment is coming from a place of concern , @entity29 @entity7 should not leave out of fear and should push their leaders to defeat anti-semitism and radical @entity38 terrorism			1
that said , none of this is surprising			0
after all , we 've recently witnessed murderous terrorist attacks on the @entity7 communities of @entity45 , @entity46 , and @entity21 , attacks that have shaken an already fearful community to its core			0
each attack adds to the feelings of insecurity among @entity53 and adds more levels of necessary security			0
as a result of the intensified wave of anti-semitism and @entity38 terrorism , @entity7 in @entity29 are eschewing @entity7 identifying symbols and are afraid to attend prayers and to send their children to their @entity7 schools			1
this has led to an unprecedented desire to leave their home countries and flee to greater freedom and security			0
but seeing schools doubling as high - security facilities sends a message to our children -- who are the next generation of @entity53 -- that their lives are in constant danger			0
of course , it is understandable and natural that the authorities choose to take heightened security measures to prevent further loss of life			0
but the fight must be taken to the perpetrators rather than allowing it to infringe further upon the everyday lives of the victims			0
if , in the words of @entity29 leaders , they would like the @entity53 to stay and not to emigrate , then they must find a way to return a semblance of normalcy to the everyday lives of @entity7 across the continent			1
how ? to defeat this bloody and belligerent strain of terrorism and the specter of radical @entity38 and jew - hatred , @entity29 authorities must be more proactive in hunting down terrorists before they act and not grant them a victory by further imposing restrictions on @entity29 's @entity7			1
the threat is not country specific , so the response must be found in @entity29 as a union			1
@entity29 nations need to immediately and urgently come together to form a pan-european authority to deal with anti-semitism and this new form of homegrown radical @entity38 terrorism , with significant resources tasked with finding concrete practical solutions			1
the first step that has to be taken is to bolster and improve intelligence - gathering and sharing across @entity29			1
the current system is neither efficient nor vigilant enough			0
many of the perpetrators of the recent massacres of @entity7 were well - known to the police			2
many crossed borders , seemingly with little trouble , before and after they committed their bloody acts			0
police and law enforcement also need to be strengthened			1
this includes actively enforcing laws against incitement and anti-semitic speech and taking a firmer approach against those who promote hate and violence			0
enforcement authorities must enter and act within largely @entity135 areas where police might ordinarily be reluctant to enter			1
additionally , new legislation to combat radical @entity38 terrorism and anti-semitism must be passed			2
the reality is that @entity29 is dealing with a new threat using an infrastructure that was not built to deal with homegrown terrorists who run freely in @entity29 and kill people seemingly at will			1
in short , @entity29 authorities have to change the current mode of action and move from a paradigm of almost pure defense onto the attack			1
our continent has known in the past how to deal with threats to our way of life , and as in the past , the best chance of victory is to be found in a continentwide unity of purpose			0
any weakness in a @entity29 - wide response to this new threat -- not just to @entity7 , but also to the very essence that our union was built upon , like freedom of thought and speech -- will be exploited by the terrorists and their supporters			1
there are probably dozens of attacks at various stages of planning taking place in towns and cities across @entity29			2
it is not enough just to increase security at any possible target , because this policy alone is not working and can not be a long term answer			0
it is time @entity29 went on the offensive .			2

@entity186 : threat of *extremism* and anti-semitism is not country specific
police and law enforcement also need to be strengthened across @entity29 , he says
