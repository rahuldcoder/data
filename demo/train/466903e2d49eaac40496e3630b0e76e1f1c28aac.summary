-- a young baseball phenom has received one of the sport 's highest honors -- recognition from the @entity6 for pitching not one , but two perfect games			1
and while a perfect game -- defined as one in which the pitcher allows no hits and no walks -- is a rare occurrence for the sport , what makes this 13 - year - old pitcher 's feat even more impressive is that she did it against the boys			1
@entity22 , once a student of former major league pitcher @entity23 , last week donated the jersey she wore to pitch one of those special games to the @entity6 in @entity27 , @entity28			1
the jersey will be part of an exhibit dedicated to the importance of women in the sport , according to the museum			2
@entity36 , who until recently honed her pitching arm in @entity39 , @entity42 's @entity41 program , told @entity0 sunday that she feels " really honored and blessed " to be recognized on a national level at such an early age			1
in addition to her @entity6 achievement , @entity36 was also recently featured on @entity49 's " @entity48 " series			1
@entity36 , who says she has been pitching since she was 7 years old , boasts a fastball in the mid- 60s ( miles per hour ) and a baffling knuckleball that has been known to make her male opponents shed a tear			1
" yeah , when i strike them out with the knuckleball , sometimes they 'll throw their helmets and start crying , " she laughs			1
" it 's just really funny to watch			0
" it 's a pitch that was perfected with help from @entity23 , who was her team 's batting pitcher before his death in 2006			0
" he would always throw it to us and i could never hit it , and so i 'd always beg him to teach it to me and finally one day he just taught it to me , " she says			0
the knuckleball has helped propel @entity36 through four seasons without a loss with her @entity79 team -- and her batting average is n't bad either , hitting over .600 this season , though she notes " i like pitching more than batting			2
" @entity36 is now participating in @entity84 for all -- an organization that advocates for women in the sport -- playing on a touring all - girls team made up of players from around the country			2
and @entity36 says her career is only getting started			0
" i want to play baseball for as long as i can , " she says			0
" i want to play high school baseball and then i also want to play on the @entity98 girls ' travel baseball team			0
" watch out , boys			0
