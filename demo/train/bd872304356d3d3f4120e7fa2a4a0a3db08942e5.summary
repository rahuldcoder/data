-- a writer commissioned to help launch a new " @entity2 " digital comics series is drawing controversy for the comics ' publisher not for his perception of the @entity8 , but for his perception of marriage -- specifically , his opposition to same - sex marriage			1
science fiction writer @entity13 has been commissioned by longtime " @entity2 " publisher @entity14 to write a two - part story launching its new " @entity2 " digital series			1
card is perhaps best known for the classic 1985 sci - fi novel " @entity20 , " but he also has sparked controversy with his outspoken criticism of homosexuality and same - sex marriage			1
" just because you give legal sanction to a homosexual couple and call their contract a ' marriage ' does not make it a marriage , " @entity13 wrote in a 2004 essay titled " @entity25			1
" the essay concluded , " ... either civilized people will succeed in establishing a government that protects the family ... or the politically correct barbarians will have complete victory over the family -- and , lacking the strong family structure on which civilization depends , our civilization will collapse or fade away			0
" news that @entity13 would be among writers on the new " @entity2 " digital comics prompted marriage - equality group @entity48 to launch a petition drive aimed at @entity14			1
" by hiring @entity13 despite his anti-gay efforts you are giving him a new platform and supporting his hate , " reads the petition -- now with nearly 12,000 signatures , according to the group			1
card is no stranger to comic - book writing			2
he has written for @entity61 , penning series such as " @entity63 " and comics based on his own " @entity20 " among others			2
the new " @entity2 " is not @entity14 ' long - running , flagship " superman " comic books but an ongoing digital anthology series of short stories about the hero that will be written by various authors			1
@entity14 , a division of @entity75 , the parent company of @entity0 , issued a statement wednesday defending its decision to include @entity13 among the writers			2
" as content creators we steadfastly support freedom of expression , however the personal views of individuals associated with @entity14 are just that -- personal views -- and not those of the company itself , " the statement said			0
@entity13 declined to comment to @entity0			2
@entity90 , whose store , @entity92 has been open in @entity95 's @entity94 neighborhood for nearly 30 years , seemed to agree			0
" someone did tweet to us about boycotting the series , but since the first day ( we opened ) we have been committed to carrying everything we can in comics , " @entity90 said			0
" i 'm sure right now on the shelves there is content i might not necessarily agree with			0
so while i understand mr. @entity13 may have advocated things that might upset people , it would be very uncharacteristic of us to refuse to carry something for that reason			0
" @entity109 who manages @entity110 in @entity111 , @entity112 -- the city where @entity13 lives -- has a slightly different reason for deciding to carry the comics			2
" our main focus is that other creators are working on this , " including artists like @entity119 who has ties to @entity110 , @entity109 said			0
" the public is running away with the @entity13 story , but i do n't want to short - change these other people working on the series			1
" @entity125 , an openly gay writer and comic - book artist who has worked on " @entity127 , " " @entity128 , " " @entity129 " and more , is not ok with the decision , and believes @entity13 's stance on homosexuality and same - sex marriage takes away certain people 's civil rights			1
" i 'm encouraging people not to buy his work because when they do they actively support a foully bigoted man who uses his power and influence to affect public policy , " @entity125 tweeted			0
@entity142 , president of the @entity143 , which has actively campaigned against same - sex marriage efforts and which counts @entity13 as a member of its board of directors , says protesting @entity13 's comics is un-american			1
" for a movement that says it 's focused on civil rights , it 's surprising that supporters of gay marriage want to attack an opposing viewpoint and become violent , " @entity142 told @entity0			0
the decision to include @entity13 comes at a time when the world of comics , while sometimes still criticized for over-sexualizing female characters , has moved to make homosexual characters a big part of storylines			2
in july 2012 , in the second issue of " @entity165 , " a new series in @entity14 ' " @entity171 , " reimagining of many classic @entity14 characters , @entity170 , the first @entity163 is an openly gay man			0
the series , along with @entity14 's @entity174 , is up for a 2013 @entity176 ( @entity176 ) @entity175			0
@entity61 had its first same - sex wedding in a june 2012 issue of " @entity127 " with superhero @entity179 -- the first major comic - book character to come out as gay in 1992 -- marrying his longtime partner , @entity183			1
