-- @entity2 football clubs are bucking the trend of the worldwide recession , with @entity6 's @entity5 leading the way after posting $ 3.4 billion in revenues for the 2007 - 08 season			1
@entity5 clubs spent more on wages last season than in any year since its inception in 1992			2
the @entity5 extended its financial superiority over its nearest rivals in @entity16 and @entity17 to more than $ 1.4 billion , according to @entity19 's @entity18			1
this result from its 20 clubs came despite the @entity24 pound 's 15 percent devaluation against the @entity26 currency , @entity19 said			2
@entity28 's @entity27 was the fastest growing league , increasing its total revenue by 34 percent to $ 1.99 billion -- with the return of @entity32 giants @entity31 to the top flight contributing two - thirds of that upturn			1
the total @entity2 football market grew by $ 1.4 billion to $ 20.76 billion , fueled by a $ 995 million increase in the ' big five ' leagues plus the staging of the @entity41 finals in @entity42 and @entity43			1
@entity19 's @entity44 , one of the authors of the report , said he expected @entity48 clubs to continue being profitable despite the uncertain economic climate , but perhaps not at the same " remarkable " rate			0
" between 1992 and 2008 , revenues for the top 20 clubs grew at a compound annual rate of 16 percent , compared with 5.4 percent for the @entity24 economy as a whole , " he said			0
" revenue increased by 26 percent in 2007/08 and @entity5 clubs generated $ 1.3 million more revenue than their nearest rivals from the other ' big 5 ' leagues			1
" it will , of course , be hard to maintain this pace in the immediate future			0
the new economic realities may lead to flat match - day revenues			0
while attendances continue to hold up well , many clubs have frozen or reduced ticket prices			0
" however , the stepped increases in the current domestic broadcast deal and the new @entity71 tv deal make it likely overall revenues will edge up			0
" @entity19 said most of the increased broadcast revenue had been spent on player wages and transfers			0
wage costs in the @entity5 soared by $ 372 million , or 23 per cent , in 2007/08 to reach $ 1.96 billion -- which represented its largest annual increase since its inception in 1992			1
@entity81 were the biggest spenders on $ 282 million , ahead of champions @entity84 ( $ 198 million ) , @entity85 ( $ 165 million ) @entity86 ( $ 148 million ) and @entity87 ( $ 123 million ) -- whose relegation at the end of the 2008/09 season could have dire financial implications for the club			0
meanwhile , @entity5 clubs ' spending on player transfers in both the summer 2008 and january 2009 transfer windows reached new record levels with an estimated $ 1.1 billion paid out			2
@entity19 's @entity99 commented : " despite this increase in wage costs , @entity5 clubs improved their wages / revenue ratio to 62 percent and generated record operating profits in 2007/08 of £ 185 million ( $ 303 million )			1
" however lower revenue growth in forthcoming seasons means clubs will have to focus on improving cost control -- both wages and other operating costs -- if profits are to be maintained			0
" @entity19 said while the @entity5 's total debt had risen , two - thirds of this was taken up by the top four clubs -- @entity85 , @entity81 , @entity86 and @entity84 -- and around $ 2 billion of it was non-interest bearing " soft loans "			1
" on the positive side of the balance sheet , these four clubs also had £ 1 billion ( $ 1.64 billion ) of assets in respect of investment in stadia and other facilities and a further £ 450m ( $ 738m ) from investment in players , " said @entity19 's @entity119 .			2
