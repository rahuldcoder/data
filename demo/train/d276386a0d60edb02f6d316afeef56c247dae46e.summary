-- @entity3 's opposition june 23rd movement is calling for a mass rally in @entity5 on tuesday to protest a ruling allowing president @entity7 to run for a third term as well as to demand the release of dozens of government critics arrested in the wake of weekend rioting that followed the decision			1
the group is also demanding that @entity3 's highest court , the constitutional council , allow three independent candidates , including @entity20 - winning musician @entity19 , to seek the presidency of the @entity23 nation , spokesman @entity14 said monday			1
the court rejected their candidacies on friday in the same ruling that granted @entity7 and 13 others spots on the february ballot			1
the court ruled that the candidates -- @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 -- failed to gather 10,000 valid signatures			2
the court ruled @entity7 could stand for re-election despite a provision in the country 's 2001 constitution that limits the president to two terms in office			1
@entity7 is in his second term in office			1
but the court ruled that his first term , won in a 2000 election , could not be counted toward the term limit because that election came before the constitution took effect			1
" between these two points of view , there must naturally be an arbiter , " presidential spokesman @entity48 said monday			0
" in our country , we have chosen as our arbiter the constitutional council			2
" the opposition , however , does not trust the decision of the council , because all five judges were appointed by @entity7 and are widely thought to have limited independence			2
@entity62 called the decision a " constitutional coup			0
" @entity66 spokesperson @entity65 said @entity7 should step aside			0
" the statesmanly - like thing to do would be to cede to the next generation , and we think that would be better			0
" she added , " we work with the government the people elect			0
but again , our view is that @entity3 democracy is strong enough to move to the next generation			1
" the ruling friday set off riots in the capital of @entity5			1
demonstrators set tires on fire and engaged in running street battles with authorities , with some protesters blocking roads by placing barricades in and around several city neighborhoods			0
one police officer died in the violence , while a journalist was injured , as police were trying to disperse crowds , according to a state news report			0
@entity48 said the planned tuesday protest will mobilize only a small fraction of the population			1
" today , the truth is that the @entity3 people are fundamentally attached to @entity7 , " he said			1
in addition to its electoral demands , the june 23rd movement is seeking the release of @entity101 , a top member of the movement , and dozens of others the group says were arrested on saturday after the riots			2
the group is also seeking the release of @entity109 , a @entity110 official accused of shooting a man to death during clashes in december			0
although @entity23 has a history of military coups and civil wars , @entity3 largely has been an exception			2
it has never experienced a military coup			0
however , political tensions have increased leading up to the february election			2
in june , thousands of protesters clashed with police in @entity5 after @entity7 proposed changes to the constitution that his critics alleged were meant to make it easy for him to win re-election			0
journalist @entity130 contributed to this report .			0
