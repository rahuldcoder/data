editor 's note : @entity2 is secretary of health and human services in the @entity5 administration			1
@entity2 says health care costs are a huge and growing burden on the economy			1
( @entity9 ) -- today in @entity11 , some politicians like to suggest that the many challenges we face as a nation mean we should n't tackle health care reform			1
nothing could be further from the truth			0
with more and more of @entity19 's families , businesses , and local , state and federal governments struggling with the crushing costs of health care , health care reform has never been more important			1
as president @entity5 has often said , you ca n't fix the economy without fixing health care			1
unless we fix what is broken in our current system , everyone 's health care will be in jeopardy			1
health care reform is not a luxury			1
it 's important to look at the size of the problem we face and where we stand			0
today , we have by far the most expensive health system in the world			2
we spend 50 percent more per person on health care than the average developed country , according to the @entity47			1
we spend more on health care than housing or food , the @entity48 reported			1
nearly 46 million @entity19 are uninsured , millions more are underinsured , and they are n't the only ones who are suffering			2
the high cost of care is hurting all of us			2
a recent study by @entity57 estimates that insured families pay a hidden health tax of more than $ 1,000 every year			0
the hidden tax is the amount businesses and families with insurance have to pay in insurance premiums , taxes and donations to help cover the cost of treating uninsured @entity19			2
health insurance premiums for families that are covered through a job at a small business have increased 85 percent since 2000 , and more small businesses are thinking about dropping health insurance benefits			0
nationwide , health care costs consume 18 percent of our gross domestic product			1
if we continue on our current path , health care costs will consume 34 percent of our gdp by 2040 , and the number of uninsured @entity19 will rise to 72 million , according to the @entity81			1
even though we spend more than any other nation on health care , we are n't healthier			1
only three developed countries have higher infant mortality rates			0
our nation ranks 24th in life expectancy among developed countries			0
more than one - third of @entity19 are obese			2
these statistics are the signs of a system that is both unacceptable and unsustainable			0
they also show us the high cost of doing nothing			0
if we choose the status quo , more @entity19 will be uninsured , costs will continue to rise , and every @entity19 's health care will be at risk			1
inaction is not an option , and reform is long overdue			0
the @entity5 administration is working to enact reform that will reduce costs for families , businesses and government ; protect people 's choice of doctors , hospitals and health plans ; and assure affordable , quality health care for all @entity19			1
we are guided by a simple principle : protect what works about health care and fix what 's broken , and do it in a way that does not add to the deficit			1
the president has already introduced proposals that will provide $ 950 billion over 10 years in savings to finance health care reform			2
much of these resources come from wringing waste out of the current system and aggressively prosecuting fraud and abuse			0
we will continue to work with @entity130 as it explores other financing options , and the president is open to ideas about how we finance health care reform			2
but we are not open to deficit spending			0
health care reform will be paid for , and it will be deficit - neutral over 10 years			2
working together , we can pass real health care reform that gives @entity19 the choices they deserve and the affordable , quality coverage they need			1
and we know they do not want us to wait			0
too many people have suffered without basic medical care or paid too much for it			0
for years , the @entity19 people have called on @entity11 to meet this challenge			0
they have waited long enough			0
the time for reform is now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : health care represents growing burden on economy
she says that because of rising cost , existing system is unsustainable
she says @entity19 pays more , but citizens are n't healthier than in other countries
