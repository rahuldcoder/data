a year after @entity0 became @entity2 's first democratically - elected president , millions of @entity2 took to the streets calling for him to step down			1
among the protesters ' complaints was the alleged " @entity6 " of the government -- the imposition of the @entity10 views propagated by the @entity11 , of which @entity0 is a member			2
so what is the @entity11 ? the @entity11 is a religious and political group founded on the belief that @entity14 is not simply a religion , but a way of life			1
it advocates a move away from secularism , and a return to the rules of the @entity22 as a basis for healthy families , communities , and states			0
the movement officially rejects the use of violent means to secure its goals			0
however , offshoots of the group have been linked to attacks in the past , and critics blame the @entity11 for sparking troubles elsewhere in the @entity36			1
many consider it the forerunner of modern militant islamism			0
in a 1997 study for @entity43 , @entity11 deputy chairman @entity41 said the @entity11 was based on two " key pillars			2
" they are : the introduction of the @entity47 ( way of life or principles ) as the basis controlling the affairs of state and society and working " to achieve unification among the @entity47 countries and states , mainly among the @entity59 states , and liberating them from foreign imperialism			0
" when was the brotherhood created ? the @entity11 has been part of the political scene in @entity2 for more than 80 years			1
it was formed there by @entity66 in 1928			1
teacher @entity66 and his followers were initially united by a desire to oust the @entity69 from control in @entity2 , and to rid their country of what they saw as " corrupting " @entity75 influences			1
the original @entity11 slogan was " @entity14 is the solution			2
" what is its history ? in its early years , the group concentrated on religion , education and social services , but as its membership grew , it moved into the political sphere , organizing protests against the @entity2 government			1
in the 1940s , an armed wing of the @entity11 was blamed for a string of violent acts , including the assassination of @entity2 prime minister @entity94 in 1948 -- shortly after he had ordered the dissolution of the @entity11			1
@entity97 himself was assassinated soon afterwards -- his supporters claimed he had been killed on the wishes of the government			0
the movement went underground in the 1950s , and decades of oppression by successive @entity2 rulers led many of the @entity11 's members to flee abroad , while others were jailed			1
in the 1980s , the group disavowed violence and attempted to join the mainstream political process , but it was banned by the regime of former @entity2 president @entity112			1
nonetheless , the @entity11 grew throughout the decade , as part of a general growth of interest in @entity14 , and the @entity118 - led invasion of @entity119 in 2003 saw a spike in membership			2
in 2005 , it won 20 % of the seats in @entity2 's parliamentary elections , running as independents			1
@entity112 cracked down on the group , jailing hundreds of members			0
why is it important in @entity2 ? the @entity11 is the oldest and largest opposition group in @entity2			1
it has had widespread support among @entity2 's middle classes , and its members control many of the country 's professional organizations			2
up until 2011 , it was illegal under @entity2 law banning all parties based on religion			0
but in december that year , its political party -- the @entity137 -- dominated parliamentary elections , winning about half of the seats up for grabs			1
the group initially said it would not put forward a candidate for president , but @entity0 ran and in june 2012 , became @entity2 's first democratically - elected president			2

his government failed to keep order as the economy tanked and crime soared , including open sexual assaults on women in @entity2 's streets			0
the chaos drove away many tourists and investors			0
@entity160 's @entity159 says the job of running @entity2 today " has to be one of the most difficult jobs on @entity163			2
" he says once the @entity11 took over , they found that much of the bureaucracy opposed them due to fears the group would impose their own supporters at every level of government			2
" if you 're president of @entity2 and you ca n't trust your police and you 're not sure about the army and you know that the bureaucracy does n't like you , you 're going to have a very difficult job at running this very complicated country , " @entity159 said			2
read more : @entity0 has few friends as deadline looms is there still support for the @entity11 ? columnist @entity182 says one of the most striking things about the 2013 protests against @entity0 has been the intensity of anger towards the @entity11			0
she points out that in june 2013 , more people had signed a @entity189 -- or rebel -- petition to withdraw support for @entity0 than voted for him in the election -- a sign , she says that " discontent has spread beyond the liberals , or former regime supporters			0
" read more : @entity2 are fed up with @entity0 why has the brotherhood fallen out of favor ? @entity182 argues that the @entity11 and @entity0 's credibility suffered when they " repeatedly broke their word			1
" @entity204 , a senior fellow for @entity36 studies at the @entity206 , points out that @entity0 promised , then failed to appoint a female vice president and a @entity209 deputy , for example			0
read more : give @entity0 a chance to fix this @entity2 accuse @entity0 and the brotherhood of engaging in a process of " ikhwaninzation " -- or " @entity6 " , @entity182 says , describing it as " a quest to take control of state institutions and impose their @entity10 views on the population			2
" " in the first wave of elections , many voters thought if they were @entity11 -- as most @entity2 are -- they should vote for the @entity11			1
and they thought secular was synonymous with atheist			0
now they 're discovering how religion can be exploited for power , " @entity182 says			0
@entity2 historian @entity230 says @entity0 adopted a " hard line , exclusive approach , " choosing @entity11 members or sympathizers for powerful and not so powerful positions in his government and the broader @entity2 administration			1

for decades they were oppressed , sidelined , sometimes torture and even killed - most recently under the @entity112 regime , he says , but they managed to stay organized			0
he says losing power after so long could be a bitter pill to swallow			0
how influential is the @entity11 elsewhere ? there are branches of the @entity11 in countries across the @entity36 and @entity255 and @entity256 , including @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259			0
there is also a branch in the @entity118 its offshoots outside @entity2 are markedly more conservative in their views : the @entity265 branch is said to oppose the right of women to vote			0
@entity268 , a member of the @entity11 in the 1950s and 1960s , developed the doctrine of jihad , and the radical group @entity271 is believed to be an offshoot of the @entity273 @entity11 .			1

in the 1940s , the group was blamed for violent attacks and it went underground in the 1950s
