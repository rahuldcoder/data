-- biologist @entity1 has been carrying a big burden for years			0
a biologist says that wherever he can get it , he 'll take money to protect turtles from a killer stretch of road			1
he 's made it his mission to save thousands of turtles from near - certain death on one of the worst turtle - killing highways in @entity16 , @entity17 just north of @entity18 , @entity19			1
the road skirts @entity21 , but that did n't stop the turtles from wanting to get to the other side			2
in three years , @entity1 counted nearly 9,000 dead turtles			0
" there were days when i would find 200 turtles attempting to cross , " he told @entity0			0
" but what sounds unreal to some in @entity31 is the solution to the turtle trouble : $ 3.4 million in federal stimulus money to build a series of walls and tunnels under the highway so the turtles and other creatures do n't have to take on the cars and trucks roaring overhead			1
@entity17 sen. @entity43 , an @entity45 @entity44 , highlighted the turtle crossing in a blistering report on what he called the 100 worst projects in the stimulus bill			1
" they are wasteful projects , and most of us do n't want to steal money from our grandkids to do something that 's really stupid right now , " he said			2
members of the turtle contingent in @entity19 were less than thrilled to be singled out			0
" you 've got 30 - to 40 - pound box turtles as big as a manhole cover , and 12 - foot alligators , " said @entity60 commissioner @entity59			0
" now if sen. @entity43 was to drive his suv speeding down @entity67 [ at ] 60 miles per hour tonight and met one of those fellows , he would have an unpleasant encounter			0
" but according to the @entity72 , the stimulus money is all about jobs , not turtles			1
@entity59 said he expected " dozens " of jobs to be created in the construction of the tunnels , but he could not be precise			2
the jobs that will last only as long as it takes to build the tunnels , and @entity1 says he 'd rather get the money to help the turtles from other sources			1
but after years watching the creatures die , and trying to slow the carnage with makeshift fences , he says he 'll take the money wherever he can get it .			0
