@entity0 -- mayor @entity2 knew in january 2012 that members of his staff had not properly reported funds raised for his 2010 campaign , according to a source close to a federal investigation into his campaign funding			1
when @entity11 , a public relations consultant , told @entity2 in a meeting that she had not reported all the expenditures from the campaign , the mayor instructed her to report them right away , the source said			1
@entity16 pleaded guilty this week to helping orchestrate a secret campaign on @entity2 's behalf			1
the allegations have led three of @entity2 's former colleagues on the @entity0 council -- @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 -- to call for his resignation , while also writing the next chapter in what has been a long history of political scandal coming from @entity0 's mayoral office			1
three of the last four occupants of the office have been stung by ethics questions ranging from crack cocaine use and possession to campaign finance violations			0
" whether or not he knew of the massive election fraud that was taking place in his name , he is responsible for it , " @entity39 said in a statement about @entity2			1
she said the scandal " has caused incalculable harm to the district			0
" on wednesday in his first public statements since @entity16 ' revelations , @entity2 said , " this is not the campaign that we intended to run			1
" @entity2 went on to acknowledge that his 2010 campaign had " issues			1
" but on thursday , @entity2 said he had no plans to resign			1
asked about the three council members who are calling for him to resign , @entity2 said there are nine other members who have not called for his resignation			1
and he said he was disappointed in @entity39 's call for him to step down			0
" she 's a constitutional lawyer and i think people you know , until somebody has proven somebody there is something , there 's no reason to raise those kind of issues , " he said			0
former senior adviser @entity74 verified the issues , saying there were basically two campaigns			0
" there were those people that were working legitimately , following the rules , playing by the rules trying to get his message out , " said @entity74			0
" and then there were these people doing this thing on the side			0
and most of us on the legitimate campaign did n't see it			0
they hid it very well			0
" @entity74 said he did n't believe @entity2 should step down over the finance infractions , as long as he did n't do anything directly wrong			1
@entity74 did acknowledged that " every candidate is ultimately responsible for his own campaign			0
" campaigns and politicians with " issues " are par for the course in @entity0 's local government			1
the litany of @entity0 politicians who became mired in political scandal and turmoil -- some of whom were forced to resign for wrongdoing -- is not a lonely group			2
the most well known of the scandalized district politicians is @entity112 , a four - term @entity0 mayor and current council member for @entity114			1
@entity112 was first elected in 1979 and was the dominant political force in the district until 1990 , when he was arrested and charged with crack cocaine use and possession			2
@entity112 was caught in a sting operation while he and his former girlfriend , @entity120 , were using crack in a room at the @entity123			2
after agents stormed the room and arrested @entity112 -- all of which was caught on camera -- the mayor became enraged and yelled , " bitch set me up			2
" the sting and arrest became a stain on the district and , in many ways , made the mayor a laughingstock			0
@entity112 was convicted of drug possession and served six months in federal prison			1
@entity112 was n't done getting in trouble			2
in 2005 , he pleaded guilty to failing to file his tax returns from 1999 through 2004			0
for that plea , the then - d.c. council member received three years ' probation			0
@entity0 political scandal is not contained to @entity112			1
in 2009 , four @entity0 council committees voted to investigate then - mayor @entity147 after city contracts were awarded to a company owned by @entity150 , one of @entity147 's former fraternity brothers			2
attorney @entity152 , whom the council appointed as the investigator , found that @entity147 did nothing wrong , but @entity152 found possible wrongdoing by @entity150 and the stain of the investigation nagged @entity147 in his losing 2010 race against @entity2			1
@entity2 has a long history in @entity0 politics , dating back to his time as director of the @entity164 in 1991			1
during his time as director , he grew the size and scope of the department and came to be known as a vocal advocate for the district 's homeless community			0
@entity2 was first elected to the @entity172 , the governing body where @entity2 made most of his political name , in 2004			2
when the chairman of the council decided not to seek re-election in 2006 , @entity2 ran for the chairmanship and won			2
he ran as a unifying candidate , with a campaign slogan of " one city , " and pledged to unite a city that had long seen distinct social and racial divides			0
@entity2 reused the " @entity180 " mantra in his 2010 race for mayor			2
but according to political analyst @entity186 , @entity2 's time as mayor may be short - lived			1
according to the longtime @entity0 political analyst , @entity2 is losing legitimacy			1
" my feeling is that it 's just a matter of time , " @entity186 said			0
" the political and the legal pressure , working almost together , i just do n't know what he comes up with as a rebuttal			0
and even if it is proven that he had nothing to do with this , and is exonerated , his legitimacy is so much in question			0
