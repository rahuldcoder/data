on tuesday night , @entity1 gov. @entity0 -- long a public fan of @entity2 -- marked the beginning of the @entity5 festival of @entity6 by comparing it to the @entity7 , which was celebrating its 241st anniversary the same day			1
there is a parallel to be drawn here -- but @entity0 chose the wrong tea party and the wrong lessons			1
the @entity6 story , to which @entity0 's statement made reference , is a fairly straightforward one : in the second century @entity18 , a small band of faithful jews , led by @entity21 , rose up against the oppressive @entity22 , which had taken control of the @entity24 in @entity25 , and won a surprising victory			1
the @entity27 recaptured the @entity24 and rededicated it to the @entity28			2
they found , however , that they had only one day 's worth of oil for the holy lamps , the menorah -- but miracle of miracles , that oil lasted for eight days			1
hence the @entity6 we know and love : eight days of candles			1
it is this story that @entity0 had in mind when he said , " the same spirit of freedom that inspired the @entity27 to rise up against a foreign empire motivated our @entity46 to rebel against the @entity49 on that fateful night			1
they knew , as the @entity5 people know , that the few can overcome the many , that right can defeat might , that faith can transcend persecution			2
" now , if we 're talking about the traditional @entity6 story described above , there are some problems with @entity0 's analogy			1
the most prominent might be the definition of " freedom			2
" for the @entity27 , what was at stake was the very existence of @entity2 : the @entity24 , the very seat of @entity67 's dwelling on earth , was in the hands of pagans who prohibited @entity5 worship there			2
the @entity7 was a complaint about excessive taxes			1
now , it 's true that some @entity76 have exhibited something close to religious fervor about the question of taxation in @entity81			2
but we should not confuse economic oppression with religious persecution			0
that " faith can transcend persecution " is usually not one of the lessons associated with the @entity87			1
( though it is the sort of language that one hears from the far right these days , almost regardless of whether the topic actually has anything to do with religion			0
) there 's also a question of degree			0
the @entity7 may have been an important symbolic act , and one whose importance has only grown with time , but it was still a symbolic act			1
this was people dressed up in costumes tossing tea into the water , to make a point to a government 3,000 miles away			2
the @entity87 did n't start for another two years after the @entity7			1
the @entity27 took up swords -- swords ! -- against an occupying imperial army			2
perhaps more important : the traditional @entity6 story , charming though it is , is n't what actually happened , or why			1
it 's true , the @entity27 took up arms to retake the @entity24			0
but their fight was n't really with the @entity22 , it was with other @entity5			0
for decades a bitter debate had raged among the @entity5 of the @entity118 : to assimilate or not to assimilate			0
in @entity25 , in the @entity24 , the assimilationists had gained the upper hand and collaborated closely with the imperial powers			0
this caused great dismay among the orthodox traditionalists , mostly living in the country , and a civil war seemed imminent			0
the @entity22 stepped in to prevent any violence -- but , naturally , they took the side of the assimilationists			2
the @entity27 were country boys , on the side of the traditionalists			0
when they recaptured the @entity24 , they were taking it back not only from the @entity22 , but from the assimilationist @entity5 who had ( in the minds of the @entity27 and their followers ) corrupted the old ways of worship			0
as for the miracle of the oil lasting for eight days : that part of the story was n't invented until hundreds of years later			0
it appears for the first time in the @entity143 , which was finished in around the sixth century @entity18 the real miracle of the @entity6 event was the military victory of a small guerrilla force against an imperial army , and that 's what was celebrated for centuries thereafter			1
in this light , @entity0 's analogy to the @entity7 seems somewhat more apt -- but the analogy should be to the modern tea party movement , not to the @entity7 of 1773			1
a small group , mostly originating outside the urban centers , which considers itself to be upholding the old customs and beliefs of its nation , and which is vigorously opposed to the inclusion of foreign elements in the national culture -- that could be either the @entity27 or the tea party			1
throw in the occasional language of secession or government overthrow and we 're almost all the way there			0
this would seem to be strong ground for @entity0 to stand on : the tea party as modern @entity27			1
the problem is that the rule established by the @entity27 was n't quite as glorious as their initial victory			0
within a century of taking power in @entity25 , the dynasty established by the @entity27 had become as hellenized and assimilationist as the one it had overthrown			0
( meet the new boss , same as the old boss			0
) its leaders took on the imperial title of " king " and took @entity189 names , and fought among themselves just as the @entity5 rulers had before the @entity27 took over			0
a little more than 100 years after the great victory of independence , @entity25 was retaken by the @entity193 , and @entity194 took command as @entity187			0
it is thus something of a grave historical error for @entity0 's statement to take this as the lesson of @entity6 : " @entity204 , like the light of the ancient @entity203 , has lasted longer than anyone could have predicted			1
" the myth of the long - lasting menorah is a distraction from the historical reality of the short - lived @entity5 independence that followed the rededication of the @entity24			2
perhaps worse , @entity0 said : " @entity6 reminds us of the power of faith to sustain a nation and ensure the security of our ally , @entity218			1
" as the @entity27 learned long ago , and as modern @entity218 well know today , faith is never a guarantee of national security .			0

@entity0 compares @entity6 to the @entity7
there is a parallel -- but @entity0 chose the wrong tea party and the wrong lessons , @entity224 says
