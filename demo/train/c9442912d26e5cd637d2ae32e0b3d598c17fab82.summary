-- the biggest sporting event on the globe may be taking place in @entity4 at the @entity5 , but try telling that to @entity7			2
the @entity8 kicked off today in typically grandiose style , amid a flurry of hats and horses			2
the traditional curtain - raiser is the @entity15 @entity14 , a race won so memorably in recent years by @entity17			1
this year saw an international field which would not have looked out of the place in @entity4 , with runners hailing from @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23 as well as the @entity24 and @entity25			2
the race was won by hot favorite @entity27 , giving trainer @entity28 his first @entity7 winner in his first season with a license having taken over from his father over the winter			1
in the @entity35 , @entity34 secured his 48th victory at @entity7 by riding @entity38 home -- his first win at the course for two years			1
" it 's important to start the meeting well , it 's been a few years since my last winner here , but i 'm getting close to 50 now , " he told reporters			0
elsewhere , @entity47 sprinted to a second consecutive victory in the @entity49			0
the seven - year - old , ridden by @entity51 , claimed a comfortable victory to underline his class			0
the day 's feature race , the @entity55 , was billed as a rematch between the @entity58 - trained @entity57 , at one time regarded as a worthy successor to @entity17 for owner @entity61 , and surprise 2,000 @entity62			1
in the event , the race did not disappoint , with @entity57 reversing the @entity62 result with a devastating victory under @entity66 ; a suitably regal victory on the opening day of a meeting as recognized for its pomp off the track as the racing on it			1
this meeting traces its ancestry back to 1711 , when sir @entity76 , master of the @entity78 , was ordered by his monarch to clear @entity7 in preparation for a horse race			0
the bond between this racecourse and royalty runs deep : the @entity85 herself typically attends all five days , arriving by horse - drawn carriage from @entity88			0
the queen 's arrival is the subject of as much fascination as the racing itself , with bookies taking bets on the color of her hat .			0
