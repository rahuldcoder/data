-- @entity2 sen. @entity1 repeatedly accused @entity4 challenger @entity3 of " fear - mongering " -- on @entity6 , @entity7 and more -- in the second debate of a @entity10 race that 's key to determining which party will control the @entity12			1
but @entity3 shot back that his are " rational fears " shared by a majority of @entity15			1
the race a dead heat			0
a @entity0 / @entity19 poll released thursday found @entity1 with 49 percent support to @entity3 's 47 percent -- well inside its margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points			1
it could turn on whether @entity1 is able to keep on her side voters who have turned on @entity27			1
his approval rating dropped to 39 percent in @entity10 -- which has driven @entity3 's efforts to connect @entity1 with the president			1
and that 's what @entity3 tried to do , using every issue possible -- illegal immigration , @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity36 among them -- to try to nationalize the debate			1
@entity1 , meanwhile , cast @entity3 as a political opportunist and turned to @entity2 ' bread - and - butter economic topics like equal pay and raising the minimum wage			1
here are six lines that showcased the debate 's top issues : @entity3 : " she calls it fear - mongering ; i call it rational fear			1
" the day another potential @entity6 case was reported -- this time , a doctor in @entity52 -- the two sparred over the @entity27 administration 's handling of the threat			1
@entity3 called for a ban on travel from the @entity59 epicenter of the outbreak			1
he blasted @entity27 's appointment of @entity62 as the nation 's @entity6 response coordinator as someone " with no experience in his field			1
" he criticized @entity1 for not voting to close the @entity15 border with @entity70			2
and he complained that the @entity52 doctor should have been quarantined when he returned to the @entity15			0
@entity3 even said the @entity6 threat would be minimized if @entity4 @entity72 had been elected president			1
" had he been president , i feel he would have had a clear and concise plan			0
he would have reassured the @entity15 people , " @entity3 said			2
@entity1 , meanwhile , criticized @entity3 for " fear - mongering about this issue , " and said neither she nor @entity3 have medical expertise on the issue			1
but @entity3 shot back that " she calls it fear - mongering ; i call it rational fear			1
" @entity1 : " i do n't think it makes sense for the president to come to @entity10 right now			2
" just like he has through the entire race , @entity3 repeatedly tied @entity1 to @entity27 -- whose approval rating , a @entity0 / @entity19 poll released thursday found , is 39 percent in @entity10			1
the political damage that association can cause @entity1 was most clear when she said she did n't want @entity27 to campaign for her			2
" the fact is , that there are big differences in this race between my opponent and me , and it 's not just about the president , " @entity1 said , repeatedly turning to issues like increasing the minimum wage and mandating equal pay			2
@entity3 said on a number of issues , @entity1 and @entity27 might as well be the same person			1
he said she 's already supported the president 's agenda for six years , and said she cast the deciding vote to approve @entity27 's signature health care law			0
" there were 60 of us , " @entity1 said , referring to the @entity12 's 60 democrats at the time , all of whom supported @entity36			2
" every one of us was a deciding vote			0
" @entity3 : " there is a rational fear ... [ of ] criminal elements , terrorists , people with diseases coming through our border			1
" illegal immigration appeared to be @entity3 's comfort zone			1
he repeatedly returned to the issue , asserting that weak border security could open the @entity15 up to an influx of @entity7 fighters , victims of the ebola virus and more			2
he criticized @entity1 's support for the @entity130 , for failing to crack down on undocumented immigrants who receive government benefits and for standing by as @entity27 moves toward executive action on immigration after the nov. 4 election			1
he said he 'd never support any bills that would " actually legalize people that are here illegally , who are not entitled to the protections and / or the rights and privileges that have been earned by our citizens			0
" @entity1 , meanwhile , cast @entity3 's position as unworkable			1
" the fact is , " she said , " if you want border security , then you should support comprehensive immigration reform			0
" she criticized @entity3 for voting in favor of a @entity4 budget that would have slashed homeland security spending , and for missing committee hearings on border security			2
@entity1 : " we do n't need to import a candidate who 's going to outsource our jobs			2
" the @entity156 landed two punches in one line -- hitting @entity3 , the former @entity159 senator , for moving into his native state to mount another @entity12 campaign and then pivoting to economic issues			2
she pointed repeatedly to @entity3 's support for oil industry subsidies , accused him of doing the bidding of large corporate interests and even tried to latch @entity3 to the @entity168 brothers , the conservative political funding giants who she said have pumped $ 2.6 million into @entity10 's race			2
the two debated @entity1 's zero rating with the @entity174 -- with @entity3 repeatedly citing that figure and @entity1 dismissing it , arguing that the organization is funded by the @entity168 brothers			1
moderator @entity178 pointed out that using @entity180 's scoring , @entity3 , while representing @entity159 , voted with @entity27 78 percent of the time			2
" well when the president does something right , i 'll support him , " he said			0
" as an independent senator , i can do that			0
" @entity3 : " we 've taken the greatest fighting force off the table			0
" @entity3 accused @entity27 -- and , by extension , @entity1 -- of blowing the @entity15 ' chances of defeating @entity7 in @entity191 and @entity192 by insisting that ground forces wo n't be part of an effort that so far has included air strikes			1
" what if air strikes do n't work ? then what ? " @entity3 said			0
he pointed to a new book by former defense secretary @entity203 accusing @entity27 of " half - steps and missteps , and as a result our allies do n't trust us , our foes do n't fear and respect us , it 's been an incoherent policy			0
" @entity1 responded that the @entity15 is " building an international coalition " that includes 60 partners , including some @entity213 countries			0
she looked for wiggle room , saying she would take sending ground troops to the region off the table " right now			0
" " i do n't think we should be putting tens of thousands of @entity15 troops back in as an occupying force , and we should also not be talking about @entity7 in a way that spreads fear and panic among our population , " she said			1
" that 's just grandstanding			0
" @entity1 : " we should make sure that people can make a living			0
" she tried to back @entity3 into a corner on whether he supports raising the minimum wage			0
@entity1 said women -- who support her over @entity3 -- would make up two - thirds of the beneficiaries of an increase in the minimum wage			1
national democrats have called for a new figure of $ 10.10 per hour			0
" this is one of the issues that distinguishes me from my opponent , because i have been supporting middle class families here , " she said			0
" i think it 's now clear that he does n't support that			0
" @entity3 said his mother worked minimum wage jobs , and that he did , as well , earning his first paychecks at a @entity247			0
he said he 's supported increases in the past			0
but he did n't say whether he supports an increase now , instead accusing @entity27 and @entity1 of trying to " dictate " to businesses already burdened by overregulation			0
" what 's happening right now is another effort by the @entity27 administration , as supported by @entity256 , to just dictate to businesses what they 're going to pay , " he said			0
poll : dead heat in @entity10 @entity12 race			0

@entity6 , @entity7 and immigration were all features of a debate that turned on fear
@entity1 said @entity3 was " fear - mongering "
@entity3 called his fears rational
