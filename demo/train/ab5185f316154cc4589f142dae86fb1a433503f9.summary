@entity0 -- in recent months , much ink has been spilt exploring why some young @entity4 @entity3 abandon a comfortable life in the @entity4 to join one of the most brutal and blood - thirsty terrorist groups in recent history , namely the @entity9 in @entity10 and @entity11 ( @entity12 )			1
sadly , much of this commentary has struggled to move beyond clich√©s that revolve around hate preachers and extremist websites			0
in order to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of why a group like @entity12 is able to attract hundreds of young @entity4 muslims , we must examine a wide range of factors that contribute towards creating a @entity12 narrative that has resonance and appeal			1
this involves facing up to some uncomfortable truths about contemporary @entity30 political discourse and coming to terms with the negative impact of the recent lurch towards vacuous literalism within @entity30 communities			2
there is a fundamental cognitive dissonance in the minds of many young muslims in @entity4 today			0
on one hand a conservative religious upbringing informs individuals that they alone have the true holy book , the true @entity44 and , of course , the true religion			0
this gives rise to lofty expectations for @entity30 societies globally			2
however , the reality of contemporary @entity30 societies , mired in poverty , illiteracy , violence and corruption as they are , stands in stark contrast to such grand expectations			2
this perturbing juxtaposition requires an explanation that neither denies the perceived reality nor challenges @entity30 exclusivist tendencies			1
such an explanation or narrative needs to take into account the sense of victimhood and humiliation some @entity3 feel and seek to externalize			1
it also needs to offer a program for restoring much - needed collective pride			1
in essence , groups like @entity12 are filling this gaping void , a void other post-colonial nationalist movements have failed to fill			2
in the eyes of the jihadists , @entity30 societies around the world are struggling today because they have been systemically undermined by western neo-colonialism and strayed from the true @entity82			2
the solution , therefore , is to expel any semblance of western influence , along with their local stooges and puppets , and introduce a strict and harsh interpretation of @entity82			0
the attraction for some is then obvious since by this narrative a struggle to understand complex geo - politics is replaced with a simplistic " one size fits all " framework			0
it does not require one to expend energy in difficult and searching introspection since all blame can be shifted to the perceived enemy and sinister @entity103 conspiracy theories			1
it replaces the quest for a firm sense of identity in an increasingly globalized and , at times , disorientating world with a militant and aggressive @entity30 identity that seeks conflict rather than co-existence in order to distinguish itself , be relevant and create tribal cohesion			0
some @entity3 who do n't subscribe to the tactics and ideological world - view of groups like @entity12 still buy into the broad narrative such jihadist and @entity120 groups purvey			1
the adoption of this broader narrative has become the default anti-establishment politics of today			0
it is a means of expressing solidarity and asserting a bold new identity while being a vehicle for seeking the restoration of pride and self - dignity			0
of course , for most @entity4 @entity3 the @entity12 narrative has no resonance whatsoever and alternative narratives to ease the cognitive dissonance are sought			1
however , the steady increase in ultra-conservative @entity82 mores in recent years , backed by petro - dollars from @entity138 , has meant the number of young @entity3 that do sympathize with the @entity12 narrative is alarmingly high			1
after all , the @entity12 reading of scripture deviates very little from the @entity142 aggressively promoted by certain @entity138			0
the hundreds of @entity4 nationals did not abandon their families in the @entity4 to join @entity12 in a vacuum			0
the proliferation of literalist and austere strands of @entity82 combined with the inability of mainstream @entity30 commentators to articulate a political narrative that does not reinforce the victimhood status and perceptions of grand @entity103 conspiracies have paved the way for @entity12 propagandists			1
in the meantime , the over-reliance of @entity159 states on law and war as a means of combating what is ultimately an ideological threat has meant extremist recruiters have yet to encounter a direct ideological challenge			0
as things stand , @entity4 and other @entity159 - born @entity3 will continue being recruited to groups like @entity12 as long as we fail to diagnose the problem correctly			1
a correct diagnosis needs to be followed by a direct and robust ideological challenge that is accompanied by alternative models and narratives for explaining the decrepit state of @entity30 societies			2
of course , positive political models that young @entity3 can aspire to also need to be articulated in a fashion that does not alienate or patronize			1
in the absence of this , dark forces that rely on unprecedented levels of brutality will continue to rise and fill a void we failed to identify .			0

we must examine why @entity12 narrative has resonance and appeal , writes @entity189
@entity189 : groups like @entity12 restore collective pride to @entity3 feeling victimized , humiliated
blame can be shifted to perceived enemy and sinister @entity103 conspiracy theories , he adds
mainstream @entity30 commentators must promote positive role models , @entity189 says
