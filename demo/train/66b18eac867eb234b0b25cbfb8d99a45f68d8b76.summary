@entity0 -- the crowd of festival goers at a holiday market in @entity0 's @entity5 friday seemed to support the message city tourism officials have been spreading far and wide : the @entity7 is open for business and welcoming its usual influx of holiday visitors			1
@entity12 's wrath a month ago will cost @entity13 $ 41 billion , according to @entity0 gov. @entity14 , but tourists have largely been unfazed by the storm , which caused very little damage to @entity18 , the hub of the city 's magical holiday attractions			1
that 's no doubt a relief to those who wondered if tourists would be skeptical about visiting the @entity7 after the storm brought the city to a standstill at the end of october			2
" absolutely not , " said @entity31 visitor @entity30 , 48 , who has traveled to @entity0 this season for the last 14 years with friend @entity33 , 46			2
" the storm did not affect our plans at all , " @entity30 told @entity1 on friday afternoon			0
in fact , @entity0 is on track for a record number of tourists this year , according to @entity41 , ceo of @entity42 , the city 's marketing and tourism association			1
the tourism association estimates there will be around 52 million tourists this year , up from last year 's 50.9 million			2
" ninety - five percent of all of our hotels , attractions , restaurants and transportation are completely back to normal , " @entity41 said			2
" for all intents and purposes , visitors should not feel deterred from coming to @entity0			1
@entity0 is open for business			1
" some tourists say media coverage of recovery efforts in the city encouraged them to make and keep plans to visit			0
" i was not skeptical at all because of everything i had seen on television , " said @entity63 , 30 , a first - time visitor from @entity64			0
storm damage in @entity0 was portrayed as " under control			2
" @entity69 , 54 , visiting from @entity70 with his wife , shared a similar story			0
coverage of the storm indicated to him that the area most crucial for holiday attractions , @entity18 , home to @entity77 and the @entity78 , was " well maintained			1
" @entity0 hotels are running and fully prepared for the holiday rush of tourists , officials say			1
" hotel occupancy is strong and there have been no cancellations due to apprehension from @entity12 , " said @entity83 , spokesperson for the @entity84 of @entity0 , representing just under 300 hotels in the area			1
yet just because tourism is expected to reach an all - time high this year does n't mean some businesses are n't hurting in the aftermath of the storm			0
at the southern tip of @entity18 in the hard - hit @entity99 , @entity95 's @entity94 , a popular eatery with visitors during the holiday season , still struggles			1
" there has definitely been a decrease in business , " owner @entity100 told @entity1 on friday			0
many restaurants rely heavily on the holiday season for a huge portion of their yearly income			0
" get the word out that we are here and ready to serve ! " @entity100 said			0
despite declines , many remain hopeful that business will pick up in the coming weeks			0
" the one to two weeks before @entity12 were very hard because many tourists did n't want to be here during the storm , " said @entity113 , who works for @entity0 , a business almost completely reliant on tourism			1
" but thankfully , now it is beginning to get back to normal and hopefully will continue on that path			0
" if the record - breaking estimates from @entity123 are any indication , that path will certainly continue .			0

@entity0 tourism officials say the city is on track for a record number of visitors
following @entity12 , most hotels and attractions are open for business
while @entity18 was largely *undamaged* , other areas are suffering *slowdowns*
