-- the @entity2 @entity1 has released new guidelines for obesity screening and healthy lifestyle counseling			1
can you explain them and give us your opinion ? in its latest recommendations , the task force suggests that all physicians screen for obesity -- defined as having a body - mass index of 30 or greater -- and direct obese patients to intensive , multicomponent behavioral interventions			1
in my opinion , this is in important recommendation , because research shows that the majority of primary care physicians do not adequately address obesity in their patients			2
this is probably because they feel that they do not have the tools to assist patients in losing weight and may be somewhat disheartened by disappointing long - term outcomes in widely publicized intensive behavioral interventions			1
for instance , in one of the largest trials , the @entity38 trial , weight loss maintenance for those in intensive behavioral counseling did not differ after 10 years from the placebo group			1
however , the treatment group still showed a 34 % reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes , even better than the group treated with a medication that reduces the risk of diabetes			0
this suggests that intensive lifestyle counseling can have significant benefits beyond just weight loss , which is often challenging in the long term			1
physicians need to communicate to their patients the impact of even a 5 % weight loss on health and disease risk reduction			1
in addition , they should become familiar with programs in their communities that provide the necessary multicomponent behavior intervention and support and encourage their patients throughout the process			2
many insurance companies , and even @entity69 , are now providing coverage for weight loss and wellness programs , so the financial aspect of referring a patient should be less of a factor than it has been in the past			1
physicians may even effectively integrate weight loss programs into their practices			1
the @entity80 ! study , published in the june edition of the journal @entity84 , found clinically significant weight loss in attendees of a moderate - intensity , primary care practice weight - management program			1
the second recommendation from the task force is a bit confusing and less useful , in my opinion			0
the task force says , " clinicians should selectively provide behavioral counseling in the primary care setting to promote a healthful diet and physical activity rather than incorporating it into the care of all adults in the general population			0
" they note that medium - to - high - intensity behavioral counseling provides small improvements in cardiovascular risk factors but that these are generally not provided by the primary care physician			0
they suggest that physicians provide this type of counseling in select patients after evaluation of readiness for change , other cardiac risk factors , community support and other priorities			2
in my opinion , the average primary care physician does not have the time or training to provide such counseling or even to fully evaluate and determine which patients will potentially benefit			2
i think doctors should address the risk factors , educate all patients briefly about the benefits of a healthy lifestyle and cardiovascular risk reduction , and provide basic literature about strategies to adopt a healthy lifestyle			0
even if the patient is not ready for change , an initial discussion is warranted with everyone , in my opinion , and may lead to positive lifestyle change			0
more intense intervention -- when appropriate and when the patient is willing -- should come from trained auxiliary staff , a registered dietician or community - based programs targeting behavior change			0
the physician should play an active role in following up and promoting behavioral change , but unfortunately i do n't think our current medical system would support a more intense , time - consuming physician intervention			0
the broader public health interventions they mention in their statement could certainly be beneficial , but i believe that more personalized , community - based , economically sensitive sessions delivered in an individual or group format would be more effective			0
more from @entity156 : is drinking soda really that bad for you ?			0
