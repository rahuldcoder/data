@entity0 -- if there 's one thing that would have struck a chord with seven million @entity6 this election season , it was @entity9 president @entity8 and his challenger @entity10 using @entity11 as a political punching bag during the recent televised debates			1
@entity9 blames @entity11 for many of its economic woes , while @entity0 has a more complex relationship with the mainland , one that is rooted in historical , cultural and political differences			1
@entity22 has long been accused by @entity23 of keeping its currency artificially low , giving @entity11 exporters an advantage over their competitors			1
last month , @entity10 accused @entity11 of manipulating its currency " for years and years , " while taking @entity9 jobs			1
he even repeated his vow to declare @entity22 a currency manipulator on his first day in office			0
a recent report from the state - run @entity35 agency warned that this mud - slinging , if converted into policy , would trigger a trade war " catastrophic enough to both sides and the already groaning global economy			0
" this is a struggle that matters to @entity0 , arguably @entity45 's leading financial center and a key bridge between @entity11 and the rest of the world			1
for one thing , @entity0 's currency is pegged to its @entity9 counterpart , so when the greenback weakens , the @entity52 is affected			1
this can force the @entity0 government to intervene , often by selling or purchasing the local currency			0
" @entity0 is part of @entity11 so tensions between the two countries will obviously affect it , " said @entity57 , an associate professor and @entity11 specialist at the @entity59			2
" but there is particular concern about how @entity8 , or @entity10 if he 's elected , handles the @entity11 exchange rate issue because it will have a big impact here			2
" yet the @entity9 election razzmatazz has n't exactly caught on at a grassroots level here -- most people are more concerned about issues closer to home			1
unlike 2008 when @entity8 claimed his first election win , coverage has generally been more muted and kept to the " @entity80 " section of local newspapers , with @entity11 's own leadership change more likely to dominate front pages			2
" people find @entity9 's election interesting , especially the debates between @entity8 and @entity10 , but they do n't think too much about their policies because @entity9 politics does not seem to bring much direct effect to our lives in @entity0 , " @entity81 , a local journalist , told @entity1			1
" some would n't even know who @entity10 is , " opined @entity90 , a local teacher			0
" @entity92 are not that political , though they do get angry about @entity11 interference or expensive house prices			0
" when the city was handed over to @entity11 by its former @entity98 colonial rulers in 1997 , @entity0 -- now a @entity95 -- retained many of its characteristics under the principle of " one country , two systems " : its own currency , an independent judiciary and a separate border requiring a visa to travel between the two territories			2
but 15 years on , many ordinary @entity6 have an uneasy relationship with @entity22 , fearing a gradual loss of their civil liberties			1
they are fiercely proud of their @entity11 heritage , but many would rather keep their mainland cousins at arm 's length			2
@entity0 celebrates @entity11 's @entity118 and @entity11 sporting achievements , but its citizens reject @entity11 attempts to influence the city 's affairs , as recent demonstrations against plans to integrate " patriotic " @entity11 history into local schools showed			1
in july , an estimated 90,000 people took to the streets to protest what critics described as an attempt to " brainwash " impressionable young minds with pro-mainland propaganda			0
for all intents and purposes , @entity0 enjoys the same freedoms @entity9 enjoy : free speech , a free press and a rule of law compatible with most democracies			2
however , @entity6 can not vote for their leaders in a @entity9 - style election			1
the city 's most senior politician -- known as the chief executive -- is " voted " in by an electoral college of 1,200 influential but unelected figures in @entity0 , with @entity22 's approval			1
earlier this year , hundreds of thousands of protesters flooded @entity0 's streets shortly after @entity152 was sworn in as the latest chief executive during a ceremony with @entity11 president @entity155 on the 15th anniversary of @entity0 's return to @entity11 sovereignty			1
they were demanding a say in who runs the city			0
significantly , the ceremony was conducted in @entity163 rather than the local @entity165 language , viewed by many as another example of @entity11 encroachment			0
while @entity11 does n't overtly decide who leads @entity0 , it does have favored candidates and says the outcome should be " acceptable " to the city 's people even though they have no say in the process			1
these simmering tensions regularly expose fault - lines at a grassroots level with growing resentment against the influx of mainland visitors			0
of the 41.9 million visitors to @entity0 in 2011 , the majority -- more than 28 million -- hailed from mainland @entity11 , according to the @entity185			2
earlier this year , a full - page advertisement decrying a so - called invasion of " locusts " from across the border appeared in a local newspaper			0
the ad in the @entity192 asked if @entity6 approved of spending hk $ 1,000,000 ( us $ 128,925 ) every 18 minutes to take care of children borne by mainland parents and declared that " @entity0 people have had enough ! " it referred to the recent surge in the number of pregnant @entity11 women crossing into @entity0 to give birth , which has put a growing burden on the resources of local hospitals			1
in addition to the perception of better medical services , many mainland women choose to give birth in @entity0 so their children have the right to stay here			0
but @entity6 also lay the blame for many of the city 's problems with their own government			2
it is frequently accused of not doing enough to address rocketing property prices , a growing wealth gap and worsening pollution			0
" i feel terribly sad about the future of @entity0			0
too many problems , too few right people to make the right decisions , " added @entity90 , who teaches high - school students			0
the city 's famed skyline projects an image of wealth and prosperity , yet more than one million @entity6 live in poverty , according to the @entity233 ( @entity233 )			0
hidden amid the city 's multi-million dollar high - rise apartments and chic shopping malls are scores of tiny , unseen tenements -- some no bigger than cupboards -- that many people call home			0
at the other end of the scale , @entity0 is also one of the world 's richest cities , with the world 's highest concentration of @entity9 dollar billionaire households relative to its small size , according to a report this year by the @entity252			1
analysts estimate the government also sits on a cash pile of about us $ 80 billion			0
yet @entity6 are choking on the city 's success as the quality of the air at roadside level in @entity0 deteriorates , often creating a haze that obscures one side of the city 's @entity263 from the other			1
according to research earlier this year from @entity59 , there are 3,200 avoidable deaths a year here due to air pollution -- more than three times higher than previous estimates			0
the battle for the @entity274 will hardly go unnoticed here but it 's just one strand in a @entity11 - dominated narrative .			2

@entity11 has been a key issue in the @entity9 election campaign for both candidates
@entity9 - @entity11 relations important to @entity0 , particularly in economic terms
@entity0 has uneasy relationship with @entity11 despite *considerable* *autonomy*
many @entity6 resent what they believe is @entity22 's growing influence
