-- @entity1 has n't stirred up this much anticipation in @entity3 since his midnight ride from @entity5 to @entity6			1
more than two centuries later , a recently unearthed time capsule he buried with fellow revolutionary @entity8 -- the man whom @entity9 was riding to see that night to warn that the @entity10 were coming -- has got his former city , state and most of the internet abuzz			1
the artifact was unearthed thursday thanks to a water leak near its resting place inside a cornerstone at the @entity18 in @entity3			1
when workers investigating the leak stumbled upon it , secretary of state @entity19 , who heads the state historical commission , called @entity24 , the head of object conservation at @entity3 's @entity26			2
" there was a big discussion about whether or not it should be removed , " @entity24 told @entity27 on " @entity28 " on friday			0
" ( @entity36 ) because there was water infiltration in that area of the building , it was decided that we 'd try to see if we could find it , investigate and see whether the box was still intact			1
" @entity24 spent seven hours thursday delicately and painstakingly chipping away at the stone to extricate it			0
" the contents are of concern , but the plaster that held the box in place is in good condition , " @entity19 said			2
according to @entity19 , the box - shaped capsule was placed by the revolutionary - era duo in 1795 , a year when @entity8 was governor and when construction began on the @entity50 and its iconic dome , which would eventually be overlaid with copper by @entity9			1
both he and @entity24 said that based on historical records , the box is believed to contain coins , a plate and a @entity9 - inscribed plaque -- but no one knows for sure			2
" it may contain other stuff , too , " said @entity19			0
" we do n't know that yet			0
" but we might soon : @entity19 , whose office is inside the @entity50 , said the capsule 's contents are expected to be revealed sometime next week			1
for now , it 's getting some @entity66 and a thorough exam -- including x-rays over the weekend -- by the museum 's staff			0
this is not the first time this capsule was unearthed			1
in 1855 it was dug up during emergency repairs to the @entity50 and put back in place , something that has hatchfield " a little worried			0
" " we 're a little worried because in 1855 , they cleaned the contents with acid , " she said			2
" so we 're a little concerned that things maybe deteriorated inside			0
" @entity19 sounded more optimistic			0
" there were some coins that were tossed in the 1855 ceremony in the mix of the mortar			0
they are in good condition , so we are optimistic that the box itself has withstood the test of time and that it will therefore be holding the contents securely , " he said			1
@entity19 told @entity0 affiliate @entity96 the capsule will probably be returned to the @entity50 , and that he 's mulling both a new container for the capsule and new items from the current era			0
113 - year - old time capsule found in @entity3 @entity0 's @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity27 contributed to this story .			1
