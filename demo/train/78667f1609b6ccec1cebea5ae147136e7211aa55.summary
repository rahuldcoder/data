-- after a year of national gridlock that ended on the precipice of a cliff , @entity1 went nuclear			1
the man who called @entity8 's re-election a travesty said @entity9 could gain control of the budget showdown because they " are sitting there with a nuclear weapon " : the specter of voting against a rise in the debt ceiling in the coming weeks			1
in other words , the @entity9 could get its way by again threatening to push the country into default			1
the remarkable thing here is not @entity1 's apocalyptic advice but that the man who still does n't concede that the president was born in @entity27 draws attention no matter what he says			1
the colorful businessman has a knack for hijacking the media -- and he 's hardly alone			1
watch : hey @entity34 , @entity33 was sick after all in fact , one of the most striking developments in recent years is how easy it is to carry out the hijacking			2
you do n't need a weapon , nuclear or otherwise			1
you do n't have to be a famous zillionaire to pull it off			2
in the @entity46 age , almost anyone can capture the spotlight for 15 seconds			1
if it 's new , novel or naughty , we are there			2
a critical mass of tweeters hijacked the presidential debates by turning @entity55 and " binders full of women " into trending topics			0
what , you thought what was most important was what the candidates said during those 90 - minute face - offs ? nope , it 's just as much about winning the post-game chatter			1
a single " oops " by @entity70 enables the press to wipe out everything else that was said			0
watch : are critics being too harsh on @entity72 ? @entity73 , telling @entity8 ( in the guise of an empty chair ) to perform an anatomically impossible act ? that hijacked @entity79 's convention			2
@entity80 inadvertently hijacked his boss ' campaign when he compared @entity79 's election strategy to an @entity84			2
nothing like a kid 's toy to seize the attention of grown - up journalists			1
any invocation of a celebrity has great hijacking potential , even if the story is a sprinkling of fairy dust			0
the political press recently surrendered to the notion that @entity98 might run for @entity101 's @entity100 seat in @entity102			2
this was based on nothing more than local chatter , amplified by @entity106			0
@entity98 shrewdly kept the door ajar -- such speculation helps in the gravitas department -- but on christmas eve , he gave the press a lump of coal by admitting he was n't running			0
watch : were the media swept away by fiscal cliff madness ? next the media got excited by the idea that @entity117 would run for office -- until he quickly popped that trial balloon			0
sometimes the hijacker wants no part of the limelight but is swept along for the ride			0
@entity124 was embedded in the nation 's consciousness for weeks after her affair with @entity128 prompted his resignation as @entity131 director			0
and her romantic rival , @entity132 , became a captive as well			0
racial tension can grab the media 's attention like few other issues			1
there are more than 15,000 murders annually in the @entity140 , but only a few move beyond local headlines			0
the killing of @entity144 , initially overlooked even in @entity145 , became a national sensation once activists persuaded the media that race played a role in the teenager 's shooting ( a perception deepened by @entity155 's misleading editing of @entity157 's 911 call )			1
week after week of routine murders in cities such as @entity160 barely register on the radar			0
watch : forget the @entity162 € ” @entity163 is pregnant ! most journalists gravitate toward sensational and sexy stories ( and i have n't been immune to the temptation ) because we want the clicks and the ratings			1
and perhaps to alleviate our own boredom with the daily grunt work of reporting			0
the on - and - off negotiations over the fiscal cliff have been tedious and incremental			0
along comes @entity1 and boom , you 've got an easy headline			1
the problem with all this media hijacking goes beyond the strange twists and turns along the way			0
it 's that we cede control of what 's important			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2

@entity190 : @entity1 said the @entity9 can go nuclear in budget showdown
@entity190 : it 's remarkable that @entity1 draw attention no what what he says
he says it 's so easy to hijack the media in the age of @entity46
@entity190 : journalists like sexy stories but should n't lose focus of what 's important
