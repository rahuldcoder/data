-- cameras in the cockpit			2
real - time streaming of communications and flight information			1
increased capacity flight data and voice recorders			1
transponders that detach on impact and float			2
once the mystery of @entity13 is solved , there are changes in air safety that might result from the lessons of the disappearance of a jumbo jetliner in the age of instant communications			1
the technologies -- each of which has its supporters and its detractors -- come into question as the search for flight 370 enters its third week			1
here 's a look at some possible technological changes : camera images beamed from cockpit to ground investigators would be able to see and hear all that transpires in the cockpit			2
former @entity39 pilot @entity38 and other experts agree that images could prove highly important during investigations			1
the @entity43 has for years campaigned for cockpit video , arguing that images would have helped it solve what happened in crashes like that of @entity49 in 1999 , which the agency concluded was a deliberate act by the co-pilot			2
a camera would have clarified who was in the cockpit and what was happening			2
opponents , however , are not ready to welcome @entity58 in the sky			2
many pilots -- and unions that represents them -- worry about an invasion of privacy			2
" years ago there was an @entity39 flight that took off out of @entity66 and an engine came off the wing , and that airplane went right into the ground , " @entity38 told @entity0			1
" they had a camera on that airplane , and people were able to see inside the airplane exactly what was happening to them			2
" @entity79 officials have said that having a camera monitor what pilots do would affect their ability to perform			2
longer life for batteries powering locator beacons the hunt for @entity13 is two weeks old			1
that means it 's near the halfway mark in the minimum battery life for the pinging beacon device on flight recorders			1
when the expected battery life runs out , possibly around april 6 , the job of finding the flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- to which the beacons are attached -- will get significantly harder and , thereby , so will the job of solving the mystery of flight 370			1
every commercial airplane is required to have pingers -- technically called underwater locator beacons -- to help locate lost aircraft			2
one is attached to the flight data recorder ; another to the cockpit voice recorder			1
the depletion of a device 's battery will not wipe out data , however			2
data has been known to survive years on modern recorders in harsh sea water conditions			2
the battery life on the beacons has been a hot subject since the crash of @entity119 in 2009			2
the flight was carrying 228 people when it disappeared from radar between @entity123 and @entity124 en route from @entity126 to @entity127			1
it took two years to find the aircraft 's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder in oceanic mountainous terrain under 13,000 feet of water			1
the battery died before searchers could locate the wreckage			0
since then , regulators and the airline industry have undertaken efforts to increase the beacon battery life from 30 to 90 days			1
there are also efforts to require pingers to be attached to aircraft airframes , making it easier to locate wreckage			1
the next - generation pingers emit pings that can be heard 6 to 10 miles away , said @entity149 , president of beacon manufacturer @entity150 uplinking information from plane to satellite before a crash the @entity156 crash spurred @entity158 aviation safety officials to look into uplinking critical flight data to orbiting satellites from airplanes flying across oceans			1
today , flight data recorders use computer chips to record information about how the plane is working in flight			1
the cockpit voice recorder captures audio from crew members including pilots			0
but all that data could be uncollected if the plane crashes in a large body of water			0
then , the devices ca n't be retrieved without help from special recovery teams			0
the @entity43 had been researching a new system that would uplink airplane data about a plane 's location , direction , equipment functions and about 30 other parameters to orbiting satellites , which would then beam the data back to the ground for storage			0
in the event of a crash , that data could be easily accessed and analyzed for clues			0
such a system would be pricey but advocates contend that it could save millions of dollars in operations to recover onboard flight data devices when a crash occurs			1
searching for the @entity156 devices and aircraft wreckage cost $ 40 million , according to a report by @entity202 's aviation investigation agency , the @entity204 et analyses			0
but critics cite potential reasons why in - flight data uplinks might not work , including high costs , limited bandwidth , security concerns , privacy issues , and cumbersome aviation bureaucracies			1
in fact , two powerful government bureaucracies with oversight of the @entity158 aviation industry -- the @entity43 and the @entity216 -- disagree about the promise of in - flight uplinks			1
real - time streaming of flight information in the age of @entity225 streaming and trans - @entity226 on flights , why ca n't aircraft - in - flight data come in real time ? @entity229 company @entity228 says it can			1
the company makes the @entity230 , or @entity231 , which automatically monitors data such as location , altitude , and performance			0
the data can be live - streamed when something goes wrong			1
the technology would have answered many questions about flight 370 , according to @entity228 director @entity241			1
" we would know where the aircraft has gone , where it is , and we would have information on what had happened in the meantime , " he said			0
on a normal flight , the system would send updates every five to 10 minutes			1
and it could be programmed to recognize when something is wrong , such as a deviation in flight path , to automatically begin streaming second - by - second data			1
the main objection has been cost , but @entity241 said @entity231 is designed to save carriers money			0
" a typical installation would be under $ 100,000 including the box and the installation parts and the labor , " said @entity241			0
" normally our customers recover that expense in a matter of months to , at most , a couple of years by virtue of the savings it creates			0
" those savings come from troubleshooting mechanical problems while the plane is in the air , he said , as well as collecting data that can help cut fuels costs			1
former inspector general of the @entity279 @entity278 does n't believe carriers will get on board			0
" ( airlines are ) very cost sensitive , " she said			0
" they simply will not add additional safety measures unless mandated by the federal government			1
" increased capacity for data and voice recorders today 's recorders are better than recorders of the past , when data was recorded on magnetic tape			0
but they fall short of current technical potential			0
voice recorders , for instance , have only two hours of recording capacity			0
since flight 370 flew almost seven hours beyond the point where something went terribly wrong , it 's almost guaranteed that crucial cockpit sounds have been erased			1
cockpit voice recorders memorialize pilot 's words -- from the inconsequential to the tragic			0
in 1999 , a voice recorder captured the last words of the startled captain of @entity49 as he fought to maintain control of his plane			0
the cockpit voice recorder helped establish that the pilot was trying to pull the plane out if a dive while his co-pilot , investigators determined , flew it into the ocean			0
voice recorders also record clicks and hums -- sounds that can reveal pilot 's actions			0
flight data recorders capture a wide array of data , including altitudes , air speeds , headings , engine temperatures , flap and rudder positions			1
and the types of data recording is growing as technology advances , a @entity43 official said			0
" we see recorders that come in for the newer aircraft of at least a few hundred ( types of data ) if not more than 1,000 , " the official said			0
they must record the previous 36 hours of operations			0
pilots , however , do n't like being recorded -- via audio or video			0
" it 's their work environment , " said @entity348 , a @entity0 aviation analyst and former @entity43 managing director			0
" they believe that the voice recorders intrude on their work environment			0
" two hours of voice recording capacity is not adequate , he said			0
" it should be the last 24 hours , " @entity348 said told @entity0			0
" there is no reason in the world now not to have data recorders digitally recording in 24 - hour time			2
" some have suggested designing flight data and voice recorders that detach from the plane on impact or shortly before impact			2
the transponders would then float			0
theories abound about @entity13 search hampered by ocean garbage problem nothing but water -- and questions the passengers : lives , not numbers @entity0 's @entity379 , @entity380 and @entity381 contributed to this report .			1
