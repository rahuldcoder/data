-- @entity1 , father of the @entity3 intern found slain nine years ago in @entity5 's @entity4 , revealed to the @entity6 recently something he had never shared before but that all parents understand			1
when he dropped off @entity9 , 24 , at the @entity10 a week before she was reported missing , " something inside of me knew it was going to be the last time i ever saw her			1
i just wish i had done something			0
" he did n't tell anyone , including his wife , about his misgiving			1
not during the investigation of @entity19 rep. @entity18 , who was having an affair with @entity9			1
not when a day laborer from @entity22 was arrested for @entity9 's murder			1
only now , nine years later , can @entity1 admit the guilt he still feels			1
surely , he knows that he 's being irrational			1
@entity9 was living and working in the nation 's capital , not a war zone			1
what was he going to do ? tell her to get back in the car ? do not be embarrassed , mr. @entity1			1
we all have these feelings about our children			0
and we rarely act on them			1
according to @entity36 , violent crimes against @entity19 12 and older are at their lowest level in more than three decades			0
as young people move through their 20s , their victimization rate , already low , declines further			0
we in the media fail to remind people enough of these things			2
we sometimes forget such statistics , however , because new and old forms of media feed us a 24 - hour - a - day diet of menace and mayhem -- the constancy of which previous generations of parents did n't experience			1
as @entity58 , a professor at @entity59 and criminal justice expert , says , " we 're inundated with information about crimes			0
the more bizarre and horrendous , the more saliency they get			0
" the steady drumbeat of crime pumps up our anxiety that something bad may happen to our child that we could have or should have prevented			1
maybe it surfaces the first time we leave our infant with a baby sitter			0
or when we give our elementary school - age daughter permission to start walking home from school by herself and she does n't call us at work the minute she gets there			2
it 's not just criminals we fear			2
we agree reluctantly to let our 17 - year - old son , a newly licensed driver , drive his friends home from soccer practice			0
it 's 8 p.m. , he 's not home yet and we start to fret			2
or we put our college student on an airplane and for a split second think , " what if that thunderstorm they 're predicting takes the plane down ? " when my grown son went scuba diving for the first time on the @entity98 , i woke up in the middle of the night worrying that his oxygen tank might fail			0
had i talked enough with him about precautions he should take ? did the tour guide know how to reach my husband and i right away should something happen ? i told myself , " he 's 25 , for @entity109 's sake			2
" that helped , but not much			0
we question ourselves less frequently as our children get older , but not a lot less			0
why ? @entity113 , a psychology professor at the @entity114 , suspects there 's more to it than media coverage			1
parents are more deeply involved in their older children 's private lives than previous generations were , he says			1
college is no longer the " declaration of independence " it used to be , for child or parent , but rather a continuation of credit card charges , daily phone calls and regular texts			2
we continue to prop up our children long after they actually need us to			0
it 's not surprising , then , that when something bad happens , we assume we could have done something to prevent it			2
the ability to stay connected round - the - clock may be the clincher			0
remember when we were in college and our parents had to phone the front desk of our dorms in the hopes of reaching us ? they knew there was a good chance we would n't get the message until the next day , if at all			1
logistics made it silly , if not useless , for them to worry immediately			0
with texting and @entity149 , @entity113 says , " we have the technical ability of constant surveillance			0
this keeps our children constantly in our minds			0
" we need not cut connections , although fewer peeks on @entity156 might not be a bad idea			0
and , says @entity113 , we need not -- indeed we should not -- repress our fears			2
instead , he advises parents to identify the specific event they 're afraid of and counter with the evidence that it 's really unlikely			1
" if possible , let it fly away as rapidly as it flew in , " he says			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity165 .			1

@entity167 : @entity1 , @entity9 's dad , feared he would n't see her again
he did n't tell anyone , @entity165 says , but now acknowledges the guilt he feels
all parents share fears about losing a child they love , @entity165 writes , but do n't act
she says media drumbeat of crime , parents ' deeper involvement *exacerbate* fears
