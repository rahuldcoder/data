-- @entity2 author @entity1 published his first novel in 2007 , a political thriller on corruption in the regime of former president @entity7			1
but he was taking a risk writing about the regime ; his day job was as @entity7 's personal photographer			1
as the novel " @entity14 " is published for the first time in @entity13 , @entity1 discussed the conflict he felt during 10 years photographing his president			1
" i was with @entity7 in the mornings and wrote against him in the evenings , " said @entity1			1
" i felt it was the most dangerous decision i made by writing about @entity7 's regime and the people around him , but i would not forgive myself if i did n't write			1
i decided that if anything happened to me it was @entity25 's will			0
" @entity1 , 33 , was with @entity7 throughout the revolution and the 18 days of uprising that led to his resignation in february , and could not join the protesters in @entity30			1
" i was involved in my heart , " he said			0

@entity7 is currently on trial , accused of ordering the killing of protesters and corruption			2
he has denied the charges			0
@entity1 said : " it took courage to write about the regime while it was in power , but not once it is gone			1

" i will write an eyewitness account as someone who worked with him for 10 years ; the good and the bad			0
no one just has a bad side			0
" he added : " the first half of @entity7 's era he was trying to be a good president , but in the last 10 to 13 years he began to relax and collect money , comfort and respect			1
he became a scarecrow , not a real president			0
" @entity1 's novel " @entity14 , " which sold 11,000 copies in @entity2 , features a society photographer who witnesses a multiple murder in a @entity70 nightclub and is then forced to go into hiding in the ensuing cover - up			1
it " exposes the seedy underbelly of life in @entity7 's @entity2 , " according to its @entity76 publisher @entity75			2
@entity1 subsequently wrote a second political thriller about corruption -- again while working for @entity7 -- which is currently being adapted into a film			1
he is currently working on his third novel , but will take a break from the political corruption theme			0
@entity1 is still an official government photographer , waiting for a new president to take over from his former boss			1
he said : " the corruption still happens			0
it 's a time of corruption now because there 's no president and no government			0
the regime is not in @entity7 , it 's inside us all			1
we removed @entity7 , but we did n't remove the regime			2
" @entity94 has begun in the first phase of @entity2 's parliamentary elections			0
presidential elections are due to be held next year			0
@entity1 hopes his next boss will be in power for only four years and will break the mold of @entity2 presidents becoming " gods			2
" " ever since the @entity105 , the king or president of @entity2 has become a god , but that must change , " he said			0
" the next president must always remember what happened in @entity30 , what happened to @entity7			2

@entity1 spent his days with president @entity7 and his evenings writing about his regime
