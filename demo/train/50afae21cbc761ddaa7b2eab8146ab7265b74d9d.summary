-- " you wo n't believe what just happened ! " it 's usually a phrase that precedes gossip , but it takes an entirely different meaning when you hear it from a head of state			0
that 's what a @entity10 president told me in february of 2010			0
i was covering the @entity13 in the beach resort of @entity15 , @entity16			0
@entity18 and @entity19 presidents were in attendance			1
the aforementioned president , whose name i will not publish for obvious reasons , had just walked out of a closed - door meeting attended by several @entity18 heads of state			1
what he told me next was unprecedented , as far as i know , in the realm of @entity18 diplomacy			2
" we almost had a fistfight , " the president said			0
at first , he would n't say who was involved , but after persistent questioning by several of us reporters he finally disclosed that then - @entity37 president @entity36 and his @entity39 counterpart @entity38 had an argument that escalated into a shouting match , and were it not for their colleagues present , would have ended up in a fight			1
i left it at gossip at first , but @entity38 himself later confirmed it			2
in an interview with @entity0 en @entity51 , the shoot - from - the - hip leftist leader , now relaxed and smiling , told the story			2
" i think that if the table had n't been there as an obstacle and our friends were n't sitting right there , president @entity36 physically would have attacked me , " @entity38 said			2
by then , @entity38 had already assumed the role of provocateur - in - chief in @entity18 politics -- a title previously held by former @entity66 president @entity65 until he ceded power to his younger brother @entity68 due to illness in 2006			1
that confrontation was not the first time that @entity38 had a run - in with a foreign leader			1
the @entity39 firebrand caused none other than @entity77 king @entity76 to lose his patience			0
the king , normally polished and refined as it 's proper for his stature , shouted at @entity38 : " why do n't you just shut up ! " after the @entity39 president called @entity77 primer minister @entity84 a fascist several times at an @entity86 held in @entity87 in november of 2007			1
i started wondering how such a renegade lacking diplomatic skills , former coup conspirator who served time in jail and supporter of an economic model that had already failed in the world had become so popular in @entity18 ? what was it about @entity38 that made him electrifyingly popular in his homeland and leftist circles in @entity18 ? and then i remembered @entity100			1
i had traveled to @entity101 in early 2010 and visited some slums on the hills surrounding @entity104			0
these slums , known in @entity101 as favelas , are a stone 's - throw away from the main tourist attractions in @entity104 , like @entity109			1
@entity100 was one of those slums where people lived in shacks , survived on pennies a day , lacked access to basic services and , in general , lived in extreme poverty and marginalized from the rest of society			0
i also remembered @entity119 , a slum in @entity121 that mirrors @entity100			0
i thought as well of @entity122 , a barrio in @entity123 , the @entity37 capital -- that is just as marginalized and poor			2
the @entity39 capital has its own favelas			0
@entity127 , a shantytown in western @entity129 , is a painfully sobering example			0
this is where the poor among the poor in @entity39 live			0
it 's an area that had been ignored and marginalized for decades			1
after coming to power in 1999 , @entity38 focused on developing welfare programs for the poor			1
the programs , called misiones sociales , have measurably reduced poverty in places like @entity127			0
@entity38 killed two birds with one stone			2
he transformed the politically apathetic @entity146 os into fierce @entity147 who voted en masse and took to the streets to celebrate @entity38 as his power increased , and to show support after he announced he was suffering from cancer in june of 2011			1
the poor , traditionally ignored and marginalized by @entity18 politicians , became @entity38 's main political weapon			1
it is true that @entity38 squandered oil revenues ( estimated at $ 120 billion a year ) , scared away investment by nationalizing foreign and domestic companies and neglected the @entity39 infrastructure			2
spending $ 30 billion a year in social programs ( used as government propaganda ) while driving away foreign investment is unsustainable in the long term			0
he managed to stack the @entity165 with loyalists who ruled consistently in his favor			0
socialist policies that undermined production and produced shortages of basic food products also fueled inflation , while a depreciation of the currency shortly before @entity38 's death promised to worsen those problems			1
@entity39 still has one of the highest murder rates in the hemisphere			0
more recently , @entity38 had taken steps to revoke the license of the last opposition tv network in the country			2
human rights groups consistently raised alarms that @entity38 was using the judicial system as a political tool to repress the opposition and silence dissent			2
" by his second full term in office , the concentration of power and erosion of human rights protections had given the government free rein to intimidate , censor , and prosecute @entity39 who criticized the president or thwarted his political agenda , " @entity191 - based @entity190 said this week , adding that the @entity38 government had shown " open disregard for basic human rights guarantees			1
" regardless , @entity208 president @entity207 eulogized the fallen leftist leader on her @entity211 account by saying that " the great legacy of @entity38 is the social inclusion of millions of @entity39 that used to be invisible and today are protagonists			1
" i would argue his legacy goes beyond that			0
an argument could be made that the @entity66 economy would have collapsed without the oil it gets from @entity39			0
@entity38 also ushered in a new area of populist leaders including @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity227 in @entity228 and @entity229 in @entity230			1
they have all borrowed @entity38 's playbook by catering to the poor and railing against the @entity235 , a country they call " the evil empire			1
" they all benefited from cheap oil from @entity39 while @entity38 made allies who helped him slowly but surely tilt @entity18 politics to the left			1
but , for the outside world , at least , the inclusion of the poor will probably remain at the top of @entity38 's legacy			1
the formula is so simple it makes you wonder why nobody though of it before			0
after all , a 22 - year - old single mother of two in @entity127 , @entity100 , @entity119 or @entity122 , does n't care about macroeconomic policies or free market economies , but about a leader who will make it possible to feed her children tomorrow			0
and to millions of @entity39 , that was @entity38 .			0

@entity38 *fashioned* himself as provocateur - in - chief in @entity18 politics
the poor , usually marginalized by @entity18 politicians , became @entity38 's main weapon
support of the poor made @entity38 popular in his homeland , leftist circles in @entity18
@entity38 ushered in new area of populist leaders in @entity18
