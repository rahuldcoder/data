@entity1 , but vocal , average @entity0 are questioning one of the most feared terror groups in the world and attempting to hold them accountable for crimes committed against the civilian population			1
from an undisclosed location , a @entity0 activist operating under the pseudonym @entity10 spoke to @entity2 about the war taking place on one of @entity16 's main front lines -- social media			1
the targets of the grassroots offensive are foreign fighters , notorious for using their @entity21 and @entity22 accounts to encourage young people to join their jihad			0
" we would like to deliver this message to those who are joining @entity16 especially from @entity28 , @entity29 , and some @entity31 countries and make them understand this is not the way , and this is not humility and this is not @entity38 , " @entity10 says , " you ca n't just go and let some guy brainwash you and make you think you will go to paradise			2
" a handful of natives split evenly inside the @entity16 strongholds of @entity44 and @entity45 recently launched the hashtags " scream from @entity44 " and " @entity47 " to heckle @entity16 extremists and share photos and news from the occupied cities			2
some of the images are grotesque ; one shows a decapitated man tied to a pole with his head in his lap , a warning of the consequences that may befall any who violate the terror group 's draconian rule			1
other images seem to act almost as a proof of life -- a small sheet of paper held close to the camera with the name of @entity10 's group scribbled in blue ink , and in the background a recognizable landmark			2
" we are hear ( sic ) and we continue to reveal @entity16 's crimes , " a caption on @entity21 reads			1
taking these types of photographs has already landed two of the activists in the custody of jihadis , according to @entity10 who said that @entity16 did not realize they were part of an organized opposition group and released them after a few days			1
but at least one endured torture at the hands of his captors , he said			0
" the regime played the media card and @entity16 did the same , and they are both very good at this , " @entity10 said explaining the importance of press coverage			1
" so i thought we have to do something about this , and all of the @entity0 people thought the same , so i am one of those who joined against @entity16			1
" they were once taxi drivers and medical students , but now these activists are among the brave few engaging @entity16 militants directly online -- questioning their beliefs and then posting the interactions for the world to see			1
" look at the murders of @entity16 they cant ( sic ) even make excuses because they are brainwashed and they are like pieces on a chess board and when they are cornered they run away , " wrote one user above a screen shot showing his account had been blocked by an @entity16 fighter after he badgered him online			2
the online taunting caught the attention of @entity16 's central command structure in @entity0 , and a sleeper cell was ordered to find and destroy the clandestine group , according to a letter @entity10 claims was leaked to his organization			1
the team of activists has yet to see a crackdown , but remains vigilant			0
" we are not scared			0
it is just a letter			0
because when you take a photo in front of @entity16 members you are risking your life to deliver the truth from on the ground , so we are used to it , " he shrugs			0
@entity10 claims that some foreign fighters are defecting from @entity16 , something reported by other activists and local media			1
he points to a literal sign of this trend -- a billboard warning truck drivers not to pick up or transport jihadis across the country			0
" it shows how scared and worried they are because the number defecting is more and more , so they are telling drivers not to help them or take them anywhere , " he said			0
@entity10 's underground network is modest so far , but similar groups in the area that have more support and resources -- including one calling itself " @entity44 is being slaughtered silently " -- have been threatened with death for publishing reports on the @entity16 operation in their hometown			2
" @entity0 people are very patient , but we have a limit , " he told @entity2			0
" what happens with @entity167 , it might happen with @entity16 and with anyone else			0
i think that might happen very soon			0

@entity0 activists are taking the fight to @entity16 over social media
they hope to counter the terror group 's online *propaganda*
the online taunting has caught the attention of @entity16 ' central command
