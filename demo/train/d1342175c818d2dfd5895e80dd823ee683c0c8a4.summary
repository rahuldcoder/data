-- vice president @entity1 kicks off a two - day swing wednesday through the eastern edge of the must - win battleground state of @entity5 , an area that president @entity6 is unlikely to visit this election year			1
and while the vice president apologized to the president last week for seemingly jumping the gun on the issue of same - sex marriage , this trip is an illustration of just how valuable @entity1 is for @entity6 as he bids for a second term in the @entity16			1
" as much as political insiders joke about @entity1 , he 's indispensable to the @entity6 ticket , " says @entity18 strategist and @entity0 contributor @entity17			1
according to the @entity6 re-election campaign , the vice president will travel to @entity5 's @entity26 and @entity5 valleys " to highlight the impact of president @entity6 's efforts to strengthen the region 's manufacturing and auto industries , as well as bolster middle - class security for @entity5 's workers			1
" the campaign says @entity1 will speak at an advanced manufacturing facility in @entity37 and at a @entity39 dealership in @entity40			0
the general manger of the dealership , @entity41 , says he 's " really surprised " that the vice president is dropping by and that people in the area " are real excited about the visit			0
" it 's not an area friendly to @entity6 , said @entity48 , professor of political science at the @entity50			1
" these are areas of traditional @entity53 strength , steel working areas , areas with a lot of working class @entity53 from the old days			0
president @entity6 has not played well there , " @entity48 explained			2
@entity6 was soundly defeated by then - sen. @entity59 in southeast and eastern @entity5 in the @entity53 presidential primary in march 2008 , and while he won the state by five points over sen. @entity64 in the general election that november , he did n't perform as well in the eastern edge of the state			1
" part of the problem is that these tend to be more conservative @entity53			0
for some of them his race may be an issue , probably not among the younger ones but among some of the older voters			0
these tend to be depressed areas , with a lot of job loss over the past couple of decades			0
there are deeply entrenched pockets of unemployment and economic distress , " @entity48 added			0
@entity1 grew up in @entity86 , in neighboring @entity87 , an area that 's also witnessed tough times in the past few decades			1
" these are places where i think @entity1 has particular appeal , as a kind of traditional @entity92 of the old school			2
he comes from a part of @entity87 that 's very much like the eastern part of @entity5			1
i think he can really connect with voters there in a way which president @entity6 can not , " @entity48 said			1
the president 's been to @entity5 21 times since taking office			2
but only two of those trips took him through the state 's eastern edge			0
but it 's not just @entity6 -- presumptive @entity18 presidential nominee @entity110 was edged out by former sen. @entity111 of @entity87 in much of the region in the march @entity18 primary			1
@entity111 gave his primary night speech in the @entity116 valley city of @entity117			0
@entity48 predicted that @entity110 will likely not " be able to connect with ( eastern @entity5 voters ) well either " ahead of the november election			1
which is why @entity1 may come in so handy in blue - collar areas in eastern @entity5 , western and central @entity87 , and in parts of @entity123			1
" his working - class honesty cuts through all the political bull in @entity126			0
he grounds @entity6 in the real world			0
in blue - collar swing states like @entity5 , @entity87 , and @entity123 , @entity1 is a tremendous asset to @entity6 who , at times , makes voters feel like he is president of the elite , for the elite , and by the elite , " added @entity17 , who was a top media adviser for @entity110 's 2008 nomination bid , but who stayed neutral in this year 's battle for the @entity18 nomination			1
@entity53 strategist and @entity0 contributor @entity141 agrees			0
" unlike @entity110 , @entity1 can talk to middle - class people without an interpreter			2
even though he 's traveled the globe and is one of the most powerful people in the world , he 's still @entity1 -- a middle - class guy from @entity86			1
" @entity1 's ability to connect with working families is one of the @entity6 campaign 's greatest assets			1
i bet they 'll be seeing a lot of him in the next six months , " said @entity141 , who was a top adviser in the @entity154 and who now is a senior adviser to @entity156 , the pro-obama super pac			0
but some @entity18 disagree about @entity1 's value to the @entity53 ticket			2
" it speaks to president @entity6 's vulnerability that the campaign has to rely on vice president @entity1 to campaign in key states like @entity5 because @entity6 ca n't identify with voters			1
between his infamous gaffes and his liberal positions on the free market and our nation 's debt , having @entity1 on the stump carries its own set of risks , " @entity169 press secretary @entity168 told @entity0			2
@entity1 's been in the spotlight recently for his comments a week and a half ago on @entity182 's " @entity181 , " that he was " absolutely comfortable " with legal same - sex marriages , a position that the president had yet to take			2
@entity6 was forced to speed up his timetable on the issue and come out with his own comments approving the unions three days later			0
some political pundits said that @entity1 was a liability to the president , while others pointed to the argument that running mates rarely matter in the race for the @entity16			0
" sure , people vote for the top of the ticket , but this election will likely turn on who can build an economy for the middle class , " @entity141 said			0
" if that 's the question , @entity1 is a big part of the answer			2
" " if i were @entity1 , i would keep @entity6 on my ticket , " @entity17 said			2
@entity0 's @entity208 contributed to this report			0

eastern @entity5 was n't a friendly region for @entity6 in 2008
@entity48 : @entity1 can connect with voters there , he 's an old - school @entity92
@entity59 took eastern and southeast @entity5 in the 2008 primary
@entity1 hails from @entity86 , @entity87 , which has also seen hard times
