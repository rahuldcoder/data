@entity0 -- a 5 - year - old 's birthday party with no cake and candles ? unheard of , except in politics			0
monday marked the fifth anniversary of president @entity14 's signing of the 2009 stimulus bill , the focus of a hyper - partisan debate over the first major legislation of his presidency			1
by most assessments , the $ 800 - billion - plus spending and tax - relief program helped reverse job losses and restore economic growth , though not as fast or strong as originally predicted			1
arguments based on political ideology persist over whether it helped or hurt the county in the long run			2
@entity14 and @entity26 argue it was crucial to the recovery from what is now called the @entity30 , while @entity31 who opposed the stimulus then still call it the wrong prescription			1
@entity35 : @entity37 ' unemployment rates @entity38 relatively silent on anniversary : for monday 's milestone , the @entity38 took the somewhat muted approach of releasing a blog post by @entity43 , the chairman of @entity14 's @entity44 , who touted a new report on the benefits from the @entity47			1
" the economy has now grown for 11 straight quarters , and businesses have added 8.5 million jobs since early 2010 , " @entity43 's blog post said			0
" while far more work remains to ensure that the economy provides opportunity for every @entity56 , there can be no question that president @entity14 's actions to date have laid the groundwork for stronger , more sustainable economic growth in the years ahead			1
" vice president @entity62 will mark the anniversary on wednesday in @entity64 , but otherwise , @entity43 's post and the final report on the stimulus by the council he heads accounted for the total administration commemoration on the presidents day holiday			1
no silence from the right : republicans , meanwhile , kept up their consistent drumbeat of criticism			0
the @entity76 sent reporters a morning email headlined : " the stimulus that was n't : five years later , it 's @entity82 's @entity81			0
" " if you recall five years ago , the notion was that if the government spent all this money -- that , by the way , was borrowed -- that somehow the economy would begin to grow and create jobs , " @entity31 sen. @entity85 of @entity86 said in a video			2
" well , of course , it clearly failed			0
" the differing reactions continue a pattern that pre-dates congressional approval of the stimulus law in 2009 with almost zero @entity76 support			2
@entity35 : where 's the debt ceiling now ? @entity31 ' set terms ' for economic debates : to @entity105 , @entity106 's national political reporter , the @entity14 administration has been weak in communicating economic accomplishments compared to @entity31 , who he said " really set the terms ... for these economic debates			2
" that was obvious on monday			0
along with the @entity76 and @entity85 attacks , @entity114 @entity76 leader @entity113 of @entity115 and two other @entity114 @entity31 leaders -- @entity117 of @entity118 and @entity119 of @entity120 -- also launched broadsides			0
the @entity76 criticism is part of @entity31 strategy to frame this year 's congressional elections as a referendum on @entity14 's presidency , with the party 's conservative base relentlessly hammering @entity26 over still - sluggish economic growth and the @entity132 health reforms			2
a @entity134 poll from 2012 showed @entity56 divided and uncertain on the stimulus issue , with 37 % supporting it , 41 % registering disapproval and nearly a quarter of respondents unsure			0
as usual , a wide partisan divide existed , with two - thirds of @entity26 in support compared to only 12 % of @entity31			1
@entity35 : 3 problems @entity143 should stop asking the @entity144 to solve @entity38 says legislative goals reached : the @entity38 report on the stimulus released monday said the legislation along with subsequent legislation intended to boost job growth achieved their goal			1
" considerable evidence suggests the federal government 's efforts to jump - start the economy were successful , " it concluded , adding that the stimulus bill " provided an important and timely boost to @entity157 in 2009 and 2010			1
" @entity14 calls for continued government investment in job creation , such as funding infrastructure projects to rebuild roads and bridges , as well as jobs training programs			0
@entity31 say stimulus proves their point : @entity31 say the legacy of the stimulus bill showed a big government approach does n't work			1
" five years later , underemployment is still too high , the number of people that have dropped out of the workforce is astounding , unemployment remains stubbornly high and our economy is n't growing fast enough â € ” proof that massive government spending , particularly debt spending , is not the solution to our economic growth problems , " @entity85 's video said			0
in response to the fresh @entity31 attacks , the left - leaning @entity185 website noted that @entity31 who opposed the stimulus bill in 2009 were happy to receive its benefits in ensuing years , with some claiming credit for projects funded with stimulus money they had opposed			1
government intervention in response to the recession began in the final months of the @entity197 administration that preceded @entity14 , with bailouts of the financial system and auto industry			0
@entity14 continued and built on that strategy with the stimulus bill and expanded auto bailout			1
the stimulus plan included almost $ 300 billion in tax relief as well as spending on various programs and initiatives including education , medical research , health care , infrastructure , local law enforcement , energy and job training			2
@entity1 's @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
