-- @entity1 , the world 's third largest internet company by market share , launched its popular instant messenger service in @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7			1
the launch of @entity9 is an international version of its @entity13 @entity12 instant messaging services , which has 600 million subscribers -- the largest instant messaging subscriber base in the world			1
versions in @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 are planned to be released early next year , a company spokesperson said			2
@entity1 is also planning the release of its first @entity5 social networking site in early 2011			1
@entity24 , product manager for @entity9 , said the launch marks a tentative step toward bringing products from the hugely popular @entity13 internet company to an overseas audience			1
" we have no intention of trying to compete with @entity32 or @entity34 instant messenger , " @entity24 said			0
" we 're looking to expand our reach outside of @entity13 to get involved with people who are interested in @entity13			2
" already @entity12 has users in 212 countries , most of who come from the @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity24 told @entity0			0
@entity1 has partnered with popular @entity5 - language web sites in @entity13 -- such as travel provider @entity43 and state - run newspaper @entity46 -- to draw more traffic from overseas consumers			1
" and if you want to instant message someone living in @entity13 , you have access to 92 percent of the online population here , " @entity24 said			1
the company is also working on a partnership with @entity57 - based @entity56 , a content discovery service company			2
@entity59 hopes to have " between 7 and 10 million subscribers " by september , @entity24 said			0
a beta version , released last year targeting expatriates living in @entity13 , has 2 million subscribers			2
@entity1 is not the only @entity13 internet company with international ambitions			1
@entity66 , @entity13 's largest search engine , launched a search service in @entity6 several years ago			1
the company has plans to expand into other regions , including @entity72 , the @entity73 and @entity74 , according to @entity66 spokesperson @entity75			0
" we are looking at markets where @entity78 is not dominant , " @entity75 said			0
" our preference is for markets with languages that are not @entity82 - based , so we have a leg up there			0
" in november , @entity66 ceo @entity85 said he hoped that in 10 years , the @entity13 search giant would become a household name in 50 percent of the world			2
with @entity13 @entity91 companies ' plans to do business abroad also come challenges that analysts say they are unsure @entity13 's domestic web giants will ultimately ever be able to overcome			1
the obstacles relate to the internet censorship policies inside @entity13 that require companies to monitor and remove sensitive content from websites and block user behavior deemed inappropriate , political or otherwise			1
" this is one of the key issues for all of these really rich @entity13 internet companies trying to go overseas , " @entity102 , a @entity103 - based independent media consultant , said			1
" when they go into developing markets , it is one thing ( because ) there is a less sophisticated user base			0
when they go into the @entity38 , they are carrying a huge amount of baggage and @entity78 added a few tons to that baggage last year			0
" read more on @entity78 in @entity13 companies , like @entity1 , have no choice but to follow @entity13 internet law or be shut down			1
@entity1 , for example , blocks chats or posts containing sensitive words from its servers			2
" for sure , i think all of the chats are monitored by @entity12 , " @entity129 , co-founder of @entity130 , a working group focusing on the @entity133 internet industry			0
" if you type in sensitive key words , the messaging will be blocked			0
i think more and more people realize the problem , but still no one will give up qq because it is part of the internet culture in @entity13			1
if you are not using it , you will lose lots of contacts in your social life			0
" most recently the company was involved in a high profile dispute with @entity149 , @entity13 's largest antivirus software provider , which alleged @entity1 was scanning private data of its more than 600 million users			1
" this whole @entity149 case only raises people 's level of suspicion , " @entity102 said			0
" @entity1 may feel it is a great company but what matters is if they can convince users they are safe and now that bar has been raised significantly			1
" @entity24 said he believes this can be done			0
" most people do n't realize that @entity12 is a very large multinational that is listed on the stock exchange and has thousands of shareholders , " the @entity9 project manager said			0
" everything needs to be transparent			0
of course we are in @entity13 so the government can put pressure on the company , and of course we have to comply with certain subjects , which are sensible in @entity13			2
but if you are not planning a coup d'Ã©tat against the @entity13 government using @entity12 , then @entity12 is a safe thing			2
