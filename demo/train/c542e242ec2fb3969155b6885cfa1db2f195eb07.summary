" one kid got hurt , and i helped him , " @entity2 says			1
another boy had gashed his arm , and @entity2 applied an ice pack and helped stop the bleeding			1
he smiles and proudly clutches the award			2
he says he likes to help kids who get hurt because he once was			2
seeing @entity2 now , it 's hard to believe he 's the same boy @entity1 met in @entity17 four years ago -- the young boy who was grabbed by masked men , doused in gas and set on fire			1
gone is the sullen , angry child , the one who withdrew when asked questions about his pain and what happened that day			1
he was so savagely disfigured it looked as though his face melted and then froze into rivers that cut through swollen hard flesh			2
since then , he 's undergone dozens of facial reconstructive surgeries in @entity32 and been through extensive counseling with his family			1
he still has scars from the attack , but it 's his upbeat attitude that 's most impressive			2

" because , like , none of my other friends make fun of me , " he says in perfectly @entity41 - accented @entity40			1
" his personality has changed so much , " says @entity46			0
" the way he interacts with people -- everything			0
it began as soon as he started school and realized that the children do n't care about his appearance			0

" ' the skin melted off ' @entity2 , now 9 , no longer remembers the details of that horrific day in @entity17			1

" the skin was melted off			0
" @entity2 's mom : why my son ? he spent two months in an @entity7 hospital , where he received primitive care			1
his father , @entity82 , was determined to get his son help			0
he pleaded with doctors and government officials -- anyone -- to give his son proper medical care			0
doctors told the family there was little they could do to help the child			2
his dad ended up on @entity1 's doorstep in @entity17 , desperate to tell his son 's story , anything to help get his little boy 's smile back			1
when @entity1 first aired @entity2 's story , viewers around the world responded to the family 's plea , donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to the @entity106 , a @entity0 - based foundation that took on his case			1
his mental recovery has by far outpaced his physical one			0
he still needs more surgeries			0
treating @entity2 has been challenging , his doctors say , because his skin tends not to heal well			1
his doctors want to slow down the pace of surgeries for now to determine how his scar tissue and skin will develop and change as he gets older			0
he loves soccer and plays on a local team			0
" i never used to do that in my country , " he says , " because it was kind of dangerous there			0
" he wants to be a doctor so he can help others when he grows up			2

the family struggles on their father 's salary of $ 9 an hour as a security guard			2
to help make ends meet , they receive welfare and food stamps			0
@entity2 's surgeries are covered by @entity143 , as they be would for other children with disabilities who live in the state			1
the family , which has political asylum , has expanded since arriving in the @entity41 -- baby @entity151 was born two years ago			1
@entity2 and his 5 - year - old sister , @entity152 , hope to become @entity41 citizens one day , too			1
@entity2 's family arrives in @entity41 the family lives in a cramped one - bedroom apartment			1
@entity2 and his sister sleep on the floor			1

he stopped and scooped up a sand ball			0
" you better not get close			0
this is a muddy one , " he said			0
i armed myself with seaweed			0
he ran shrieking toward the water			0
" this is going to be more fun than last time , " he said			0
the last time was when the family first arrived in the @entity41 in september 2007			1
@entity2 had never seen the ocean before : he laughed and giggled every time the waves crashed against his feet			1
the ocean still brings that healing quality			0
between our sand ball fights , @entity2 grows reflective			1
he 's lived nearly half his life in the @entity41 he loves it here , but he 's still desperately homesick			1
he wishes he could go back to @entity7			0
" because it 's kind of my country , and i miss everyone i used to know there			0
" yet he and his family know a return home will likely not come anytime soon			2

sometimes when i tell them , ' i wish i could visit you , ' they say , ' no , you can not come			0
