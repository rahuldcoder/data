editor 's note : @entity2 is the author of a new book , " @entity4 : getting down to the @entity5 , " to be published in march			1
he provides commentary on @entity9 's " @entity8 " daily from 4 to 7 p.m. et. you can also visit @entity2 's @entity12 blog			1
@entity2 says @entity13 understands that the @entity14 is the " people 's house			1
" @entity17 ( @entity9 ) -- i think i am developing a crush on @entity21 's first lady			1
@entity13 is more compelling than her husband			1
he 's good , but she 's utterly fascinating			1
mrs. @entity13 has blown away the stale air in a @entity14 musty from eight years of the @entity26			1
it 's like the sun came out and a fresh spring breeze began wafting through the open windows			2
it 's the people 's house , and @entity13 totally gets it			1
so much so that she has taken to inviting people in from the streets to see her home			2
nice touch -- one completely lacking in her recent predecessors			0
watch her when she visits a local school and you see the warmth and affection she instantly triggers in people			2
kids are pretty much totally honest with very good bs - detectors			0
if they sense you 're a phony , forget it			2
but around the first lady , they want to hug her and laugh with her and tell her stories			2
you can see the same qualities these kids recognize in her daughters			0
she is the consummate mother as evidenced by the poised , polite smiling children she and her husband are raising			0
i have four daughters , and trust me -- they do n't turn out like the @entity13 children without devoted parents			1
new to the @entity62 neighborhood , @entity13 has taken it upon herself to go around and introduce herself to the people in the various agencies of government			1
when 's the last time a first lady did that ? i do n't ever remember it before			1
and during her visits she listens rather than lectures			0
and people respond to her			2
she was raised on the south side of @entity75 by blue - collar parents			0
she went to @entity77 , and @entity78			0
but in many ways she 's still a kid from the south side of @entity75 , and that 's what makes her special			2
she knows exactly who she is			0
the @entity84 bring a humanity and humility to their tasks which sets them far apart from the run - of - the mill phonies who populate @entity62			0
it 's exactly what the doctor ordered for this wounded nation			0
@entity13 's unassuming , but dead - on , sense of style has the fashion press gushing all over itself			1
her arms are becoming the stuff of legend			0
who appears sleeveless on the cover of @entity105 , let alone in front of a joint session of @entity108 while her husband delivers one of the most important speeches of his life ? and the reviews were rave			0
@entity114 , the editor of @entity115 gushed , " @entity116 ! the first lady has bare arms in @entity108 in february at night ! " if she keeps it up , @entity119 will soon stop making women 's clothes with sleeves			1
ok , i admit it			0
when it comes to the first lady , i 'm smitten			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1
