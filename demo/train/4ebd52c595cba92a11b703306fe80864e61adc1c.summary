-- it was the day before my 58th birthday			1
i had decided to end my 57th year doing something that was unthinkable when i turned 57			1
you see , eight months ago i got the unexpected news that i had been selected as a member of the 2013 @entity9 team			1
at that time , the main event , the @entity11 , seemed a lifetime away			1
i could n't run a mile , swim a single lap or even sit clipped in on a road bike without falling			2
one of my most enthusiastic supporters over the past year has been a co-worker who has challenged me to do things physically that i never would have done without his support and encouragement			2
he challenged me to do a local @entity22 race one month into training when i was sure i was n't ready			1
thanks to him , i accomplished my goal of finishing the race without walking			2
he challenged me to hike the @entity27 -- a 2,000 - foot vertical climb that is not for sissies ! he also challenged me to ride my bike to work			1
which gets me back to that fateful pre-birthday morning			2
triathlete - to - be conquers first time in ocean my daily commute is 29 miles one way , with a few serious hills			1
in the days before the ride , i studied the course and knew it would be a challenge			2
the night before , i started wondering if i had bitten off more than i could chew			2
the morning of the ride , i was still uneasy , at one point even regretting that i had accepted the challenge			2
everything changed at 5:15 a.m. , when i opened my garage door to wait for two of my friends who had generously volunteered to ride along with me			2
there was an immediate excitement in the air as we made our final preparations and took off , right on schedule at 5:30			0
it is hard to put the next 2Â½ hours into words			0
just as i reached the top of the first big hill , i saw a blue car pulled off to the side of the road			0
i assumed it was someone with car trouble			0
as i got closer , i recognized the familiar face of one of my co-workers			0
he was smiling and clapping , cheering us on ! i soon realized that he was there intentionally , something totally unexpected , giving me a mental boost and surge of energy i can not describe			0
training dedicated to slain colleague it only got better			1
every few miles , much to my surprise , dozens of my friends were staged , holding big signs and cheering me on along the highway			1
once we reached our destination , my co-workers were waiting for us , cheering us into the finish line like it was the @entity83			0
i have to admit that all the attention was actually a bit uncomfortable for me			0
i am certainly not the first person who has made this particular ride			0
in fact , i can not think of a day that i drive to work that i do n't see at least several fellow bikers along the way			1
i am still overwhelmed at the thought of so many people getting up early and going out of their way to show their support for what i was doing			0
it was the best birthday present ever			1
throughout the day , i was repeatedly asked how the ride went , and if i was sore			1
my answer was that it went great , and i actually felt wonderful			0
most of the credit for that belongs to my friends who rode with me , changed my flat tire , and made me feel like a superstar			0
each one of them has been there for me along my fabulous journey this past year			0
they know where i started and have celebrated my progress			0
they are just as excited for the upcoming triathlon as i am			1
most of all , they validate what i have known all along : i am the luckiest person in the world			0
at the beginning of 2013 , i was feeling heavy , sluggish and tired			0
i had convinced myself that , at 57 , that was my fate , and that i just needed to accept that feeling energetic and healthy was a thing of the past			0
the key to fitness ? schedule it in from the very beginning , i have viewed my selection as a member of this year 's @entity127 team as a once in a lifetime opportunity			1
but being 20 to 30 years older than my five teammates , i thought that i would not be able to accomplish as much as they did			0
despite this , i remained dedicated , and focused every day on the advice to " keep moving forward ! " that powerful mantra , along with the love and support of my friends , family and co-workers , has given me a strength and confidence going into my 59th year that i never had before			1
i no longer use my age as an excuse , because it is anything but that			1
in fact , i have 11 months to set a new goal -- something i 'll do on the day before my 59th birthday that seems impossible today ! follow @entity148 on @entity149 @ @entity150			1
