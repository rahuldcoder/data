-- i took a day off to head upstate with some friends for a relaxing weekend in the country			1
plaid shirts were worn , showers were abstained from , and copious amounts of pork , wine , and other stuff were ingested			0
a great time was had by all , especially when my girlfriends took the time to put their heads together to come up with a " back - up plan " for yours truly			1
first , let 's just talk about what , exactly , a back - up plan is			1
should life not go as ideally intended -- in career , love , etc. -- many people have a @entity25 my career as an editor for a mega popular lady site goes belly up ? my back - up plan is to freelance full - time from @entity32			1
romantic back - up plans have become fodder for many movies , including one which just hit theaters this weekend , aptly titled " @entity38 , " starring @entity39			1
in the film , which i am assured is terrible , @entity40 conceives twins via artificial insemination ( her " back - up plan " ) " only to meet the man of her dreams the very same day			1
" oh no ! the @entity0 : is @entity49 secretly married ? according to @entity51 , back - up plans rarely go as planned			2
in " @entity55 , " @entity54 ' character 's back - up plan is to marry her lifelong male best friend if they 're both single at 30			1
and , of course , just before the clock strikes midnight on the day of her 30th birthday , aforementioned guy best friend announces he is engaged and @entity54 ' character , of course , realizes she loved him all along			2
the @entity0 : why women on dating sites do n't respond to men i had a half - hearted back - up plan like this in college			1
i told myself that if " things did n't go as planned " in my love life by , uh , 30 - something ( which seemed dreadfully old at the time ) , i would just get together with this guy friend of mine named @entity73			2
nothing romantic or sexual had ever happened between us , save this one drunken almost - kiss , and i do n't think i included him in the back - up plan - making decision process			1
he was just rad and cute and we liked the same things			0
last week i reconnected with him -- perhaps my subconscious mind was trying to find out whether this " back - up plan " needed its own back - up plan -- and as it turns out he 's got some girlfriend he hopes to marry , so good for him			1
the @entity0 : sneak peek at the new " @entity96 " so , back to my new back - up plan , or rather the back - up plan people - who - shall - remain - nameless have concocted for me			1
i woke up from a nap ( one of many , as napping is what we do for fun in the country ) to hear a couple of my girlfriends whispering			0
" why have n't they ever dated ? " @entity110 asked			0
" i do n't know , i do n't think either of them has ever thought about it , " @entity111 concluded in a hushed tone			0
noticing me sitting there staring at them , @entity111 said in a more normal tone of voice , " we were just talking about how you and @entity120 could be really good together			0
i think if you 're both single in five years , you should get together ! " ok , then			0
they gave me a long list of reasons why this would be awesome and were very proud of themselves			0
i nodded and smiled and rolled my eyes and then went back to sleep			2
the @entity0 : here 's what it costs to date a celebrity in fairness , it is not an appalling idea			2
@entity120 is a perfectly awesome dude			0
we have been friends for a long time			2
i 'm sure he will make a wonderful boyfriend / husband / baby daddy to someone someday , just as i will make a wonderful girlfriend / wife / baby momma to someone someday			0
and all joking aside , i know my friends mean well , even if selfishly they love us both and thus would be over the moon if we loved each other like that , because then everyone would be happy and wearing plaid and eating pork together			2
in truth , there are certain things i really want in life -- a gratifying career ( check ! ) , someone to love romantically who loves me back equally and just as fiercely ( foot - tapping ) , and , eventually , kids			0
i 've already explained which qualities i really desire in a man ( though a few are hardly necessities ) , but what if that man does n't come along ? we do n't always get everything we want in life			0
which is why i have a back - up plan of my own			1
i 'm just not sharing what it is			0
