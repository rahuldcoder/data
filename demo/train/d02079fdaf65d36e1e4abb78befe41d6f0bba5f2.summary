-- the case of a @entity5 citizen sentenced to 15 years in a @entity7 labor camp is not a " political bargaining chip , " the @entity2 's state - run @entity1 reported sunday			1
@entity9 , known as @entity10 by @entity5 authorities , was arrested and prosecuted for various crimes aimed at " state subversion , " @entity1 said			1
it previously reported the @entity14 was arrested november 3 after arriving as a tourist in @entity16 , a port in the northeastern corner of @entity7			1
in prior instances , @entity7 has released @entity5 in its custody after a visit by some @entity5 dignitary			2
but @entity10 's case could get caught up in the recent tensions between the @entity7 , as the @entity2 is formally known , and the @entity5			1
" whenever @entity5 were put under custody in the @entity7 for violating the country 's law , former or incumbent high - ranking @entity5 officials flew to @entity28 and apologized for their crimes and promised to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents			1
therefore , the @entity7 showed generosity and set them free from the humanitarian point of view , " @entity1 reported , citing a foreign ministry spokesman			0
" @entity9 's case proves that as long as the @entity5 hostile policy toward the @entity7 remains unchanged , humanitarian generosity will be of no use in ending @entity5 ' illegal acts			2
" according to the report , @entity10 entered @entity7 " with a disguised identity			1
" he reportedly " confessed and admitted his crimes			1
" " some media of the @entity5 said that the @entity7 tried to use @entity9 's case as a political bargaining chip			1
this is ridiculous and wrong guess			0
" the @entity7 has no plan to invite anyone of the @entity5 as regards @entity52 's issue , " read the @entity1 report			2
last week , the @entity5 demanded @entity10 's immediate release			1
" you all are aware of the history and how this has happened in the past with @entity5 citizens , " @entity55 spokesman @entity54 told reporters in @entity57			2
" but what we 're calling for and we 're urging the @entity7 authorities to do is to grant him amnesty and to allow for his immediate release , full stop			0
" @entity54 said the @entity55 was still trying to confirm details of the case through @entity71 diplomats who visited @entity10 last week			2
@entity71 represents @entity5 interests in @entity7 because @entity57 has no diplomatic relations with @entity28			0
@entity5 officials have struggled to establish how exactly @entity10 ran afoul of @entity7 authorities			1
@entity10 's sister told @entity0 last week that her brother is the owner of a tour company and was in @entity7 for work			0
he 'd traveled to the country previously with no problems and had no reason to suspect that this time would be different , said @entity84			0
" you know , @entity10 is a good man ; he 's not a spy			0
he has never had any evil intentions against @entity7 , or any other country for that matter , " she told @entity0 's @entity88 360			0
@entity7 is considered to have one of the most repressive penal systems in the world			0
human rights groups estimate that as many as 200,000 people are being held in a network of prison camps that the regime is believed to use to crush political dissent			0
@entity0 's @entity101 and @entity102 contributed to this report .			0
