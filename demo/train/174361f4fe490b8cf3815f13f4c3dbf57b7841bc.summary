the federal government will close 173 air traffic control towers at small - and medium - size airports on april 7 because of forced spending cuts , the @entity0 told tower operators tuesday			1
it will close another 16 towers on september 30 , the end of the fiscal year			1
@entity10 , head of the @entity11 , told @entity12 that @entity0 officials gave him the news , capping off a five - day period in which the @entity0 first told contractors they would close scores of towers , then backtracked on the news			1
the @entity0 said it would consider removing individual towers from the list on a case - by - case basis , if the operators can explain why it is in the national interest to keep them open , @entity10 said			1
the news tuesday , if anything , was worse than previously announced			0
last wednesday , the @entity0 said it would close 168 towers			2
some democrats oppose @entity34 plan for government funding " we 're extremely discouraged and disappointed that the @entity0 is taking this action , " @entity10 said			2
" the rest of the @entity0 's budget is getting a 5 % haircut ; the contract towers are getting a 75 % cut , because the @entity0 is cutting 189 of the 251 contract towers			1
" " it 's hard for us to see the fairness in the budget cuts			0
it seems the contract tower program is taking a high , disproportionate cut			0
we have serious concerns about the safety , efficiency and loss of jobs in almost 150 communities across the country , " he said			0
the @entity0 did not immediately respond to a request for comment			0
the towers are part of the @entity0 's contract tower program , in which 251 towers are staffed with contractors instead of @entity0 employees			1
though little - known , contract towers are widely used by the @entity0 to manage air traffic			1
such towers handle approximately 28 % of all control tower operations , although the towers being cut account for a little less than 6 % of commercial airline operations			0
@entity73 , ceo of @entity74 , which staffs contract towers in the @entity76 and @entity77 , said the decision was " not unexpected			2
" opinion : spending cut			0
now , @entity34 , where are the jobs ? " i did n't think they 'd resolve it in favor of the contract tower program			0
i kind of expected that they would continue on their course , " he said			0
asked for his reaction , he said , " you 're asking a guy who 's having to lay off a ton of people because of this			0
" tower closures would not necessarily result in airport closures , because some aircraft can land without air traffic control help , and those that need controller help can communicate with more distant @entity0 facilities			1
but the contract tower closings will contribute to the workload at other @entity0 facilities , which simultaneously will be coping with controller furloughs			2
a 2011 report by the @entity109 's @entity108 said contract towers cost on average $ 537,000 a year to operate , compared with $ 2 million for comparably busy @entity0 - staffed towers			1
the lower costs were chiefly from lower staffing and salary levels at contract towers , which had an average of six controllers , while @entity0 towers had 16			1
and a typical contract controller near @entity120 , @entity121 , received a base pay of $ 56,000 per year , compared with a base pay ranging from $ 63,000 to $ 85,000 a year for an @entity0 controller in @entity125 , @entity121 , the study said			2
@entity10 said contract towers are carrying the brunt of the cuts , despite having comparable safety records and being more cost efficient			1
but the forced spending cuts , known as the sequestration , are also affecting @entity0 staff			1
most of the agency 's 47,000 workers , including its 14,700 controllers , have been told to expect one or two furlough days every two - week pay period			0
and 49 @entity0 - staffed towers are on the list of those facing possible closure			2
longer lines at airports due to budget cuts ?			0

spending cuts prompt tower closures at small and medium airports , agency tells operators
it says 16 more towers will close on september 30
@entity0 says keeping any of the towers open would require showing it 's in national interest
the move applies only to contract towers , which use contractors , not @entity0 employees
