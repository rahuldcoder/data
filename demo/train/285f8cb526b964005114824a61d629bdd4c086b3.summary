-- the year was 1937			0
it was the dawn of the soft - drink machine , the first tube of the @entity4 ... and the shopping cart			2
@entity7 's prototype for the shopping cart was nothing more than two wire baskets attached to a folding chair , but it was the start of what would become a supermarket staple			2
when it first came on the scene , customers were reluctant to use the cart			0
but by the 1960s , they were so ubiquitous that a new problem had arisen : the rogue shopping cart			2
@entity21 supermarket owner @entity20 was so enraged by the volume of stolen shopping carts popping up in places decidedly not supermarkets ( in auto repair shops , people 's basements and at the bottom of rivers ) that he went on a crusade to return them to their rightful owners			1
in 1969 , he deemed february @entity34 to the @entity35			1
@entity20 died in 2009 , but his crusade reappears each february on various websites and internet forums , and was even acknowledged by the @entity39			0
when we brought this to the attention of the @entity45 community , our contributors mentioned that until now , they had never noticed how prevalent wayward shopping carts were			1
while it may be easy to write off @entity20 's crusade as just the hysterical rant of a disgruntled business owner , retailers report cart theft to be a costly problem			1
shopping carts cost anywhere from $ 75 to $ 150 each , according to @entity56 of gatekeeper systems			1
retailers find customers ' ambivalence toward the issue frustrating , but most people ca n't help but think that there are greater causes to raise awareness about			0
" am i supposed to really feel sorry for the grocers ? " asked @entity66 from @entity67			0
the great cart robbery @entity71 , president and ceo of the @entity73 , found that stores that report the greatest losses are located in neighborhoods and cities where few people own a car , but still need an efficient way to carry their groceries home			1
once the shoppers are finished , the carts rarely return to the store			0
@entity71 said that he 's seen many innovative uses for shopping carts , such as portable barbecue grills , lounge chairs and even shelters			1
he noted that many homeless people use them to transport their belongings			0
in november , @entity94 state lawmaker @entity93 attempted to clean up the state 's homeless problem by taking a sledgehammer to abandoned shopping carts			1
@entity94 has the country 's highest rate of homeless per capita ; @entity102 said his solution was meant to encourage them to seek out shelters			0
" i get a lot of complaints about stolen and abandoned shopping carts in @entity109 , and i was thinking as a public servant , ' what can i do that would be practical and i can literally do overnight ? ' " @entity93 told @entity0 affiliate @entity113			2
" i 'm not doing anything different than doing a community cleanup , or what the city 's administration has tried to do with the issue of people illegally camping on the streets			0
" supermarkets and community members are n't the only ones upset about the stray carts			0
the city of @entity127 , @entity128 , reported an annual cost of $ 50,000 to retrieve abandoned shopping carts from local streams and rivers			1
across the country , @entity133 , president of the @entity135 nonprofit @entity134 , said that volunteers have removed more than 200 shopping carts from the creek that drains into the @entity140 since 2009			2
" they create an environmental hazard by trapping wildlife and causing artificial dams along the stream , which lead to flooding and erosion , " @entity133 said			0
stores are working to contain the problem through the use of cart containment systems -- the wheels lock when they reach the boundary of the store 's parking lot -- and by hiring companies to locate and return the carts for a fee			1
and yet , it 's not hard to find plenty of shopping carts in the wild ... scroll through the gallery to see some of the spots where carts have turned up .			2
