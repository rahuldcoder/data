a new @entity1 app is making waves in the commercial shipping world by providing an early warning system that aims to reduce maritime collisions with endangered whales			1
the @entity7 was launched at the start of april and produces up to the minute data regarding sightings of right whales near busy shipping lanes off the north east coast of @entity14			0
the program is a collaborative effort between 13 different organizations including the @entity18 , the @entity19 and the @entity20			2
see also : how @entity21 can help save the whales although there are only a handful of incidents between ships and the giant mammals each year , any collision that leads to a right whale fatality can have a major impact on the species status due to its severely depleted numbers			1
" the right whale is one of the most endangered large animals on the planet , there are only between 350 to 550 of them left " says @entity33 of the @entity18			1
" if a ship strikes a reproductive female then the mortality impact could be very large in terms of what it means for the overall population , " adds @entity33			0
the @entity46 works by collating up to the minute reports from all the organizations involved in tracking or researching right whales in the @entity14			2
see also : rare dolphins boosted by sea sanctuary this information is then used to pinpoint right whales straying within a five kilometer radius of major shipping lanes			0
ship captains with access to the free app via their @entity1 or @entity59 can then reduce their speed , change course or increase their vigilance so as to avoid a potential collision			1
" by increasing mariners ability to comply with regulations and protective measures , you increase protection for the right whales ( as well as ) decreasing the chance that mariners will be fined for violating ( those ) regulations , " says @entity33 " @entity19 has fined some ships up to $ 92,000 dollars for going too fast repeatedly in seasonal management ( conservation ) areas , " he adds			2
see also : activists using drones against @entity80 whalers so far there has been 9,600 downloads of the @entity7 from @entity83 and @entity33 believes the idea could also be extended to reduce shipping collisions with whales in other areas of the world			1
he cites the @entity90 strait where sperm whales frequently cross busy shipping lanes as well as off the coast of @entity94 where collisions with @entity97 's whales are common			0
" we 've invented this on our own , " says @entity98			0
" but we expect it to be extremely influential in terms of creating a model for a lot of other conservation efforts			0
