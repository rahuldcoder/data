-- it 's a loaded question , one with no clear answer			2
but in the year since @entity5 's co-founder and visionary ceo died , it 's been asked in tech circles over and over : who is the next @entity9 ? there 's one easy response			1
it 's safe to say that no figure in the tech industry will perfectly duplicate the unique blend of vision , salesmanship , mystique and eye for detail possessed by @entity9 , who died one year ago friday			1
and it 's complicated further , some say , by the fact that for much of his own life , many would n't have predicted @entity9 himself would earn tech - icon status			1
" @entity9 had a strange career			1
he really was n't celebrated as a genius until really late , " said @entity28 , editor of the cult of @entity31 blog and author of books on @entity5 , including " @entity34			1
" not until @entity9 returned to @entity5 and introduced the @entity37 and @entity38 did people begin to praise him as a modern - day @entity39 , @entity28 said			1
" he was dismissed before then as a marketing guy , a fast talker who did n't know much about technology			0
he only really was lionized in the last four or five years			0
" # @entity45 : share your thoughts on his life and career but industry observers abhor a vacuum			0
futile though it might be , it 's perhaps human nature to speculate about who could emerge to fill the void left by the passing of tech 's biggest personality and most recognizable face			1
one can make cases for or against a handful of nominees			0
and no list is long enough to include an as - yet unknown creator who may be birthing the industry 's next game - changer in a garage or dorm room somewhere			2
did @entity5 's fanboy fever peak with @entity9 ? but here are some names worth considering , with thoughts both for and against their candidacies : @entity74 , ceo , @entity75 pros : @entity74 actually has a host of traits that mirror @entity9			1
like @entity9 was with @entity5 , he 's the founder of @entity75 as well as its ceo			1
being a part of a company 's life story helps			2
as much as anyone , @entity74 also captures a bit of @entity9 ' panache at live events			1
at last year 's rollout of the @entity87 , he got high marks for introducing a game - changing product in a stylized fashion , then getting off the stage			2
( @entity94 giants @entity95 and @entity96 have been accused of being rambling and unfocused at similar unveilings			0
) reports say @entity74 shares @entity9 ' penchant for attention to detail ( some would say micromanaging ) and , like @entity9 , he 's been willing to take the company into new and unexpected directions			1
" i 've met @entity74 personally , and he is mesmeric			1
brilliant smile , quick mind , very engaging and decisive , " @entity28 told @entity0			0
" he has the same obsession with the ordinary consumer ; to make and sell things from the consumer 's point of view			2
... @entity74 has @entity9 ' focus and drive			1
he 's a little bit maniacal in his drive and ambition			2
" cons : despite the @entity87 line , @entity75 is , at its core , a content company			1
the mobile devices are a means of delivering books , music , movies and other data to customers as directly as possible			0
will the public ever be as excited about the ceo of the company that peddles e-books and data - storage space as it was about the one that sold it its personal computers , laptops , phones and music players ? @entity139 , ceo , @entity140 pros : the @entity141 -- @entity9 and @entity142 -- had their garage			1
@entity139 had his @entity145 dorm room			1
and in those two rooms , perhaps the two best - known origin stories in tech were born			2
as head of the social network that has changed the way people use the @entity153 , @entity139 is maybe the only tech boss who , like @entity9 , has become a household name			1
( " @entity155 " did n't hurt			0
) he created a product that millions of people now use			0
and he 's even cultivated his own trademark , casual - wear style , as the @entity139 hoodie is now almost as iconic as @entity9 ' mock turtleneck			1
" @entity139 has some of the characteristics ( of @entity9 ) , and perhaps the most important one -- the pursuit of a vision , " @entity28 said			1
" that sets him apart			0
" cons : he 's gotten better at speaking in public			2
but as a pitchman , @entity139 still falls miles short of the charismatic @entity9			1
it 's seems @entity139 would rather be the idea man behind the scenes than front - and - center when it comes time to sell the final product			1
also , the fact that @entity140 's stock price is not already racing toward @entity95 / @entity5 heights does n't help			1
@entity176 , ceo , @entity5 pros : well , there 's the obvious one			1
job 's was @entity5 's ceo			1
at the helm of the company , @entity176 gets to be the face of every new innovation rolled out by @entity5			1
he 's got the biggest stage and brightest spotlight in which to put himself forward			0
cons : @entity176 comes from more of a business background than one of innovation and design			2
he may masterfully steer @entity5 's course for years to come , but , rightly or not , few observers at this juncture are inclined to give him credit for vision , or influence over products ' design , the way they did @entity9			1
plus , being @entity5 ceo after @entity9 is like being the football coach who follows a retiring @entity203 or @entity204			1
what were those guys ' names ? exactly			0
@entity208 , senior vice president , @entity5 pros : when @entity9 stepped down , there were many who expected @entity208 , not @entity176 , to step up			1
@entity208 is senior vice president of industrial design and is believed to be the creative mind behind products from the @entity215 to the @entity37 to the @entity216			1
the @entity218 native already has a knighthood , as well as a healthy dose of @entity9 ' true - believer passion for the product			2
cons : well , he 's not the ceo			2
( nor is marketing mastermind @entity224 , another name bandied about to replace @entity9 )			2
to truly ascend to @entity9 levels , @entity208 would need to set out on his own -- which , at 45 , is doable			1
it 's hard to envision @entity208 bolting from @entity5 , where he 's worked since 1992			1
but , boy , it would be fun to watch			0
@entity231 , ceo , @entity232 pros : if you need proof of how well @entity95 alum @entity235 is liked in @entity236 , just look at the number of folks she 's been able to lure to join her at a @entity232 that was floundering when she took the reins in july			1
at @entity95 , where the former engineer was the 20th employee , she 's credited with everything from the clean design of the search page to becoming one of the leading public faces of the tech giant			2
cons : it looks like a turnaround has begun at @entity232			2
but the job 's still a long way from done			0
if @entity235 becomes the face of a dramatic rebirth , she will have accomplished something few predicted			0
if she does n't ( the four ceos before her all fell short ) , it likely wo n't hurt her reputation all that much -- but neither will it bump her up to the next level			0
@entity264 , serial entrepreneur pros : how 's this for an origin story ? @entity264 grew up in @entity267 before leaving home at 17 , without his parents ' consent , rather than serve a compulsory stint in an army which , at the time , was enforcing the race - based apartheid system			0
he 'd end up in the @entity275 four years later -- although he 'd already sold his first software , a video game called @entity278 , when he was 12			0
since then , all he 's done is create publishing software @entity279 ( sold to @entity281 for $ 300 million ) , co-found @entity282 ( he owned 11 % of its stock when @entity285 bought it for $ 1.5 billion ) and help create @entity286 , makers of the first commercial electric car			0
oh , wait ... he also runs @entity288 , a company working on space exploration			0
director @entity290 says @entity264 was his inspiration for @entity294 's @entity293 character in the " @entity296 " movies			0
" his ambitions are so huge , " @entity28 said			0
" he 's definitely a ballsy character			0
and he 's a good leader , like @entity9			1
he 's surrounded himself with good people			0
" cons : with the exception of @entity286 , none of @entity264 's projects , so far , have directly involved consumer products			0
tens of millions of people had something @entity9 made in their pockets , on their desks or piping music into their ears			2
among the public , @entity264 may be less well - known than all of the names above -- at least for now			0
but , at 41 , he 's got time to change that and it would be foolish to bet against him			0
@entity318 , ceo , @entity320 , @entity321 pros : who ? @entity318 is the wild card on this list			0
but consider him the representative of a new generation of young , creative tech " makers " who could ascend to loftier heights in the years , or decades , to come			0
at 22 , @entity318 's @entity320 raised more than $ 20 million in funding			0
he founded his first web company at 12 and has moved on to start @entity321 , a mobile - payments system that 's also raked in millions from investors			0
he got rock - star treatment for a speech he gave last year at @entity336			0
plus , he 's already cultivated a @entity9 - like signature fashion statement -- his trademark orange sunglasses and shirts			1
cons : in the startup world , for every success story , there are countless washouts			0
not every young turk even wants to be another @entity9 , and not every killer app has the potential to make millions , or billions , of dollars -- even when they 're well - liked and widely used			2
good or bad , what lessons did you learn from @entity9 ? share your responses in the comments below , or join the conversation on @entity354 using # stevejobstaughtme			2
@entity0 's @entity356 contributed to this story .			0

since the death of @entity9 , the tech world has looked for its next visionary
@entity139 , @entity75 's @entity74 , @entity232 's @entity231 are names that come up
at @entity5 , ceo @entity176 and vice president @entity208 have big shoes to fill
most agree there will never truly be " the next @entity9 "
