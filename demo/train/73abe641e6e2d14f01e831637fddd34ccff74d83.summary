after the firestorm over @entity2 's disclosure of @entity4 surveillance programs , the most contentious aspect revealed by last year 's classified leaks will continue under reforms announced friday by president @entity8			1
someone will still collect records of the numbers and times of phone calls by every @entity4			0
while access to the those records will be tightened and they may be shifted from the @entity19 to elsewhere , the storage of the phone metadata goes on			2
for that reason , civil libertarians , members of @entity21 and others complained that @entity8 failed to go far enough in what his administration labeled as the most comprehensive intelligence - gathering reforms since he took office in 2009			1
in his 45 - minute speech at the @entity30 , @entity8 unveiled new guidance for intelligence - gathering as well as reforms intended to balance what he called the nation 's vital security needs with concerns over privacy and civil liberties			1
by making the changes after a review he ordered following the @entity2 disclosures , @entity8 put his signature on the @entity4 intelligence operation and helped define his legacy as a chief executive who had promised a more open and transparent government when he entered the @entity48 in 2009			1
he outlined a series of steps -- some immediate and some requiring time to work out , possibly with @entity21 -- that would change some aspects of the @entity19 collection of phone records and other information but generally leave intact the core and function of existing programs			2
@entity8 also addressed concerns abroad that the @entity4 spies on ordinary people as well as allied leaders			0
@entity2 's disclosures showed @entity4 surveillance of personal communications of leaders in @entity64 , @entity65 and other allies			2
" the @entity4 is not spying on ordinary people who do n't threaten our national security " @entity8 said , adding that " unless there is a compelling national security purpose , we will not monitor the communications of heads of state and government of our close friends and allies			1
" @entity8 not dwelling on @entity2 before @entity8 spoke , a senior administration official who briefed reporters on condition of not being identified said the president 's assurances of no further spying on foreign leaders extended only to " dozens " of heads of state and government of @entity4 friends and allies			1
initial reaction indicated those favoring robust intelligence gathering agreed with the president			2
director of national intelligence @entity89 said @entity8 " took a measured and thoughtful approach , " while defense secretary @entity92 said he supported the reforms			1
house speaker @entity94 warned @entity8 against allowing politics to " cloud his judgment " over maintaining what the @entity99 @entity98 called necessary programs for national security			1
" @entity104 will review any legislative reforms proposed by the administration , but we will not erode the operational integrity of critical programs that have helped keep @entity4 safe , " @entity94 said in a statement			0
on the other side , @entity98 sen. @entity98 of @entity110 said the speech deserved " an @entity118 for effort and probably a ' c ' for content , " while @entity114 founder @entity113 told @entity115 that it was " embarrassing " for a head of state to speak so long and " say almost nothing			0
" " unfortunately , today , what we see is very few concrete reforms , " said @entity113 , who noted that @entity2 intends to publicly respond to @entity8 's speech as soon as next week			2
sen. @entity125 of @entity126 , an independent who caucuses with the majority @entity127 , called @entity8 's speech an first step in a necessary dialogue on balancing security needs with privacy rights in the digital age			2
" the devil is going to be in the details , " @entity125 said , adding that the discussion will continue for years as technological capabilities expand			0
@entity8 : @entity138 has helped us @entity8 's changes to the controversial @entity19 telephone bulk collection program disclosed by @entity2 require intelligence analysts to get approval from the @entity144 to go into the metadata stored by the agency			1
today , the @entity19 determines when analysts can examine the metadata , a senior administration official told reporters on condition of not being identified			0
" that is no longer an issue that is dealt with solely within the @entity19 , " the official said			0
" they have to bring it to the @entity158 court			0
" in addition , @entity8 said he ordered attorney general @entity160 to work with intelligence officials on finding another place to store the metadata records that include phone numbers and the length of calls , but not content			2
@entity8 also called on @entity21 to authorize establishment of a new panel of outside advocates to participate in " significant cases " before the secret @entity158 courts that handle intelligence collection issues			1
another step extended @entity4 legal protections involving surveillance to foreign nationals , noted @entity115 chief national security correspondent @entity177 , who called the president 's speech extraordinary in one way for publicly addressing what had been top - secret programs seven months ago			1
however , @entity177 noted @entity8 's reforms made no mention of losses by @entity4 technology businesses around the world due to concerns that customers would be spied on under the programs disclosed by @entity2 's leaks			1
some critics on both sides of the political aisle contend collection of such vast amounts of information violates personal privacy			0
@entity127 sens. @entity199 of @entity126 and @entity200 of @entity201 said they intend to continue pushing legislation to limit the metadata collection beyond what @entity8 proposes			0
@entity98 rep. @entity205 of @entity206 said that " @entity21 must do what the president apparently will not : end the unconstitutional violation of @entity4 ' privacy , stop the suspicionless surveillance of our people , and close the era of secret law			0
" in his speech , @entity8 argued that national security depended on access to such data as long as it was under proper control and regulation			1
read @entity8 's remarks " no evidence of abuse has been found involving surveillance programs , but changes are needed in response to legitimate privacy concerns that have been raised , @entity8 said			2
the new guidance he issued declared the @entity4 will not collect intelligence " for the purpose of suppressing or burdening criticism or dissent , or for disadvantaging persons based on their ethnicity , race , gender , sexual orientation , or religion			0
" offering a historical review of @entity4 intelligence gathering , @entity8 recalled events in @entity4 history going back to @entity245 's famous ride			2
the 9/11 terrorist attacks raised the profile and priority of @entity4 intelligence efforts , the president said , and now technological advances that allow supercomputers to gather huge amounts of digital data have complicated efforts " to both defend our nation and uphold our civil liberties			1
" @entity8 and the bottom line @entity8 remained critical of @entity2 , who is now living under asylum in @entity261 , following his series of leaks that began last june and transformed the debate on national security surveillance in the post 9/11 era			1
" our nation 's defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nation 's secrets , " @entity8 said			0
" if any individual who objects to government policy can take it in their own hands to publicly disclose classified information , then we will never be able to keep our people safe , or conduct foreign policy			0
" while the bulk telephone data remains with the @entity19 for now , @entity8 wants those records moved out of government hands , though it is uncertain where , a senior administration official said in briefing reporters on condition of not being identified			1
federal courts are divided on @entity19 telephone data collection			0
one judge in @entity294 ruled preliminarily in december that it was probably unconstitutional on privacy grounds			0
a second judge ruling in another case in @entity299 subsequently found it lawful .			0

house speaker @entity94 says any changes ca n't harm national security
president @entity8 issues new guidance for intelligence - gathering
an advisory panel recommended in december that government better protect civil liberties
