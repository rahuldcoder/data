-- @entity1 has promised never to bite a player again after the @entity3 issued an apology to @entity6 's @entity5			1
in a carefully worded statement on his official @entity9 page , @entity1 , who has been hit by a four - month ban by world governing body @entity12 for biting the @entity13 , said he " deeply regretted what occurred			1
" the statement added : " i apologize to @entity5 and the entire football family			0
" i vow to the public that there will never again be another incident			0
" the @entity22 star 's punishment , which also includes a nine - match international ban , prohibits him from football - related activities , meaning he will be prevented from training with his teammates until late october			0
@entity1 's statement on @entity9 continued to insist that the bite resulted from a " collision " with @entity5			1
the @entity13 defender accepted the apology via @entity33 saying the incident was " all forgotten " before repeating his call for @entity12 to reduce @entity1 's suspension			1
in his defence to @entity12 , @entity1 reportedly said he had lost his balance and had fallen on " top of his opponent			1
" in a @entity12 disciplinary committee document , the @entity3 explained : " at that moment , i hit my face against the player , leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth			2
" in no way did it happen the way you have described , as a bite or intent to bite			0
" given the bite on @entity5 was the third such offense of @entity1 's career , @entity12 took an altogether dimmer view of the incident , handing down a tough punishment to the 27 - year - old foward			1
when playing with @entity63 club @entity62 in 2007 , @entity1 was suspended for seven games for biting an opponent , while he was hit with a 10 - match sanction for an identical offense while playing for @entity22 in april 2013			2
he also courted controversy in 2011 , when he was handed an eight - match ban for racially abusing @entity71 's @entity70			0
following previous indiscretions , @entity1 has enjoyed the backing of his club @entity22			2
@entity1 has been heavily linked with a move away from @entity22 and , with the 27 - year - old set to miss the first nine games of the @entity80 season , it remains to be seen whether the @entity82 team will continue to stand by its man .			0
