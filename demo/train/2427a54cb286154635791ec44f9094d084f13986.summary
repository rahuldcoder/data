@entity0 -- top congressional democrats renewed their push wednesday for legislation that would remove all oil spill liability caps -- a move some @entity7 warn would lead to stronger monopolies in the energy sector while increasing @entity11 dependence on foreign oil sources			1
among other things , @entity2 are targeting the 1990 @entity14 , which could limit @entity16 's liability for economic damages incurred by the @entity19 disaster to $ 75 million			1
critics note that the amount is a small fraction of the cost a major oil spill like the @entity19 disaster will inflict on communities			1
@entity16 has said it will waive the cap on damages and pay " all legitimate claims " as a result of the @entity19 spill , the largest in @entity11 history			1
@entity2 leaders on the @entity33 , however , said during a hearing wednesday that the caps need to be permanently lifted under the law			2
the issue was also broached during a meeting of the @entity39			0
the @entity40 held a separate hearing on the hotly disputed matter on tuesday			0
" if you or i ... got into an accident that we caused , ( we 'd be ) responsible for all the damages , " said sen. @entity43 , @entity44 , the @entity33 's chairwoman			2
there would be " no caps in that case , and there should be no caps in this case			2
" the proposal now under consideration originally would have raised the cap to $ 10 billion			1
democrats later changed it -- with the backing of the @entity62 -- to eliminate the cap completely			1
" the person who makes the mistake ought to be responsible , " said @entity65 @entity2 sen. @entity64 , one of the bill 's sponsors			2
" and if the penalty is that they 're going to be responsible and have to pay , they 're sure going to be a lot more careful about what they 're doing			0
" but sen. @entity76 , @entity77 , argued that the proposal would give the largest energy companies a virtual monopoly by making oil drilling in places like the @entity19 prohibitively expensive			1
it will " kill all competition that big oil faces " and turn the @entity19 " into big oil 's own private pond , " he asserted			1
" we can not close down the @entity19 ... without putting ourselves at hostage even further to the @entity89 , the @entity90 , @entity91 ( and other oil producers ) that do n't have to follow " the same standards			2
if we get this wrong , @entity99 sen. @entity98 said , it " could set back this nation 's energy future for decades			1
" we need to approach the issue " logically and not emotionally			0
" sen. @entity101 , @entity102 , dismissed @entity99 concerns about the potential creation of a new energy monopoly			2
this is n't about mom - and - pop drillers , he said			0
" this is about safe versus unsafe companies			0
" " if you 're an unsafe company that 's also small , we should ( all ) be concerned , " he said			0
" small safe companies should be able to continue operating in the @entity19 without fear			0
" sen. @entity114 , @entity115 , suggested that @entity116 should adopt for oil companies the liability standard currently used by the nuclear industry , under which every company is held responsible for any accident			2
" all of the operators ... are interested " in what 's happening at other reactors , he said			0
under that standard , " you would n't have the prospect of @entity128 or @entity129 sitting on the sidelines watching @entity16 " trying to deal with the current spill			0
sen. @entity134 , @entity135 , in turn pushed an alternative measure specifically holding @entity16 liable for the current @entity19 disaster without permanently repealing liability caps			1
@entity101 slammed @entity134 's plan , calling it " bad public policy and also ( probably ) illegal			0
" the $ 75 million cap is one of several potential limitations on oil companies ' liability now being targeted by @entity2			1
several senators have also blasted a 2008 @entity11 @entity148 ruling that cut the amount of punitive damages a jury awarded to victims of the 1989 @entity131 by $ 2 billion			0
they 've also criticized an 1851 law limiting shipowners ' post-accident liability to the value of a sunken vessel			0
rig owner @entity158 used the law in the days immediately following the april 20 @entity19 explosion to attempt to limit its liability to $ 26 million .			1

top democrats say removal of oil spill liability cap needs to be permanent
the 1990 @entity14 caps liability at $ 75 million
@entity7 warn a removal of liability caps would create an oil monopoly
it " could set back this nation 's energy future for decades , " senator warns
