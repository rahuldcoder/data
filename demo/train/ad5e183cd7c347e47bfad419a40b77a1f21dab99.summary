-- president @entity1 answered the following 10 questions on @entity3 during a live online " @entity3 " chat wednesday afternoon			1
read about @entity1 's @entity6 chat here below are the questions and answers as they appeared on @entity3			1
--- --- -- q : gobearss how do you balance family life and hobbies with , well , being the @entity14 ? a : @entity15 it 's hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that i 'm spending enough time with michelle and the girls			1
the big advantage i have is that i live above the store - so i have no commute ! so we make sure that when i 'm in @entity27 i never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if i have to go back down to the @entity30 for work later in the evening			1
i do work out every morning as well , and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble			1
speaking of balance , though , i need to get going so i 'm back in @entity27 in time for dinner			1
but i want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run			1
and remember to vote in @entity47 - if you need to know how to register , go to @entity49			1
by the way , if you want to know what i think about this whole reddit experience - not bad ! --- --- q : hmlee i am recent law school graduate			1
despite graduating from a top school , i find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden			1
while i 'm sure my immediate prospects will improve in time , it 's difficult to be optimistic about the future knowing that my ability to live a productive life -- to have a fulfilling career , to buy a house , to someday raise a family -- is hampered by my debt and the bleak economic outlook for young people			1
i know that i 'm not alone in feeling this way			1
many of us are demoralized			1
your 2008 campaign was successful in large part due to the efforts of younger demographics			2
we worked for you , we campaigned for you , and we turned out in record numbers to vote for you			2
what can i say to encourage those in similar situations as i am to show up again in november ? what hope can you offer us for your second term ? a : @entity15 i understand how tough it is out there for recent grads			2
you 're right - your long term prospects are great , but that does n't help in the short term			2
obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers			2
because of the health care bill , you can stay on your parent 's plan until you 're twenty six			2
because of our student loan bill , we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry			2
but the key for your future , and all our futures , is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that 's why the choice in this election is so important			1
the other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy ( paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education ) and getting rid of regulations we 've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers			1
these ideas have been tried , they didnt work , and will make the economy worse			1
i want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to @entity124 , promote @entity126 energy sources ( including wind and solar ) , keep investing in education and make college more affordable , rebuild our infrastructure , invest in science , and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $ 250,000/year			1
i do n't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges , but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation , and for generations to follow			2
so do n't be discouraged - we did n't get into this fix overnight , and we wo n't get out overnight , but we are making progress and with your help will make more			2
--- --- -- q : silent1mezzo what 's the recipe for the @entity156 's beer ? a : @entity15 it will be out soon ! i can tell from first hand experience , it is tasty			2
--- --- -- q : suzmerk what are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term ? a : @entity15 money has always been a factor in politics , but we are seeing something new in the no - holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks , most undisclosed , into @entity174 ; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens			0
we need to start with passing the @entity180 that is already written and been sponsored in @entity181 - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who			0
we should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists			0
over the longer term , i think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn @entity192 ( assuming the @entity193 does n't revisit it )			0
even if the amendment process falls short , it can shine a spotlight of the @entity198 phenomenon and help apply pressure for change			0
--- -- q : @entity202 what was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term ? a : @entity15 the decision to surge our forces in @entity210			0
any time you send our brave men and women into battle , you know that not everyone will come home safely , and that necessarily weighs heavily on you			0
the decision did help us blunt the taliban 's momentum , and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month , and will end the war at the end of 2014			0
but knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget			0
--- -- q : daveforamerica what is the first thing you 'll do on november 7th , win or lose ? a : @entity15 win or lose , i 'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country , and the amazing young people in our campaign offices			0
--- --- - q : @entity242 how are you going help small businesses in 2013 and 2014 ? and what if any bills are you going to implement for small businesses , in 2013 , and 2014 ? a : @entity15 we 've really focused on this since i came into office - 18 tax cuts for small business , easier funding from the @entity255			0
going forward , i want to keep taxes low for the 98 percent of small businesses that have $ 250,000 or less in income , make it easier for small business to access financing , and expand their opportunities to export			0
and we will be implementing the @entity263 bill that i signed that will make it easier for startups to access crowd - funding and reduce their tax burden at the start - up stage			0
--- --- -- q : @entity271 we know how @entity272 feel about protecting @entity273			0
is internet freedom an issue you 'd push to add to the @entity278 's 2012 platform ? a : @entity15 internet freedom is something i know you all care passionately about ; i do too			0
we will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business			0
and although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals , i wo n't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform			0
--- --- - q : ormirian are you considering increasing funds to the space program ? a : @entity15 making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration			0
the passing of @entity308 this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past ; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered			0
the key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station , we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned @entity326 flight .			1
