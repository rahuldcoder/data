the @entity2 bombing suspects used @entity4 lights and model - car parts to make the explosives , prosecutors said in court documents obtained by @entity8 on wednesday			1
" the @entity2 bombs were constructed using improvised fuses made from @entity4 lights and improvised , remote - control detonators fashioned from model car parts , " federal prosecutors said in a motion filed wednesday			1
" these relatively sophisticated devices would have been difficult for the @entity17 to fabricate successfully without training or assistance from others			0
" to obtain explosive fuel for the pressure cooker bombs , the filing says , brothers @entity24 and @entity26 " appeared to have crushed and emptied hundreds of individual fireworks containing black powder			0
" authorities say @entity26 and @entity30 , 20 , planted bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race			2
@entity26 was killed during the manhunt that paralyzed @entity35			0
@entity30 has pleaded not guilty to killing four people and wounding more than 200			2
it 's not time yet for prosecutors to make their full case against @entity30 , but as attorneys spar over what evidence can be used in the high - profile death penalty case against him , the description of what materials were used to make the bombs was among several new details about last year 's terror attack and its aftermath included in court documents			1
the motion also includes additional details about the note @entity30 allegedly wrote while he was hiding out inside a boat in a backyard in @entity57 , @entity58			1
" @entity60 has a plan for each person , " @entity30 wrote , according to the court document			2
" @entity63 was to hide in this boat and shed some light on our actions			0
" in their 29 - page motion , prosecutors detail @entity30 's medical care while at @entity35 's @entity70 , arguing that information from more than 11 hours of @entity73 interrogations while he was hospitalized should be admissible			1
prosecutors cite several reasons why they needed to question @entity30 without reading him his miranda rights against self - incrimination and without allowing him access to a lawyer			1
evidence law enforcement had at the time , they argue , suggested a possible larger conspiracy			2
@entity73 agents had " reason to believe that the @entity17 had accomplices and that they or others might have built additional bombs that posed a continuing danger to public safety			0
" the note scribbled inside the boat referred to others , saying , " we are promised victory and we shall surely get it , " according to wednesday 's motion			0
also , a search of the @entity97 ' homes failed to uncover traces of the black firework powder used to build the pressure cooker bombs , suggesting that it had been built elsewhere and with help			0
the @entity4 lights used as fuses and the model - car remote control used to detonate the devices also suggested a level of sophistication that suggested terrorist training , prosecutors said			0
@entity30 was lucid while hospitalized and was not coerced into making any of the statements , they argue			1
according to the court documents , @entity30 was questioned about 22 hours after undergoing surgery for multiple gunshot wounds			2
he had been weaned off the sedative propofol but was still on pain medication			0
@entity73 agents questioned him on and off over a nearly 38 - hour period , conducting 14 interviews and giving @entity26 frequent breaks , including a 10Â½ - hour stretch so he could sleep , the court documents say			2
prosecutors say the @entity73 's interview took time because doctors had performed a tracheostomy to allow greater airflow			1
@entity30 initially answered by nodding or writing in a notebook and then later spoke his answers			0
although @entity30 denied that anyone else was involved , authorities believed he might be lying or concealing the involvement of others , according to prosecutors			2
government officials have maintained that @entity30 was questioned under the " public safety " exception to the @entity135 warnings , which allows for limited questioning of a suspect by law enforcement to determine whether there is imminent danger of an attack			0
" the fact that @entity30 was in the hospital recovering from bullet wounds does not mean the interview was coercive or that the agents who conducted it did anything wrong , " the prosecutors ' motion says			2
@entity30 , prosecutors allege , wanted to explain the bombings and take credit for them			1
" as the note he wrote in @entity57 on the inside of the boat reflects , @entity30 was eager to take credit for his crimes and ' shed some light ' on their meaning			0
that indeed is a common practice among terrorists , " the motion says			0
@entity30 's attorneys have said that evidence from the hospital interrogations should n't be allowed in court , arguing that he was coerced into making incriminating statements			1
they argue that the statements were involuntary , that the public safety exception agents used did n't apply to the interrogation and that @entity30 's first court appearance was postponed to allow for additional questioning			1
@entity73 agents questioned @entity30 , his attorneys argue , " despite the fact that he quickly allayed concerns about any continuing threats to public safety , repeatedly requested a lawyer , and begged to rest as he recovered from emergency surgery and underwent continuing treatment for multiple and serious gunshot wounds			1
" they also argue that the @entity73 agents deliberately misled @entity30 about his brother 's death			1
prosecutors say that @entity73 agents did n't tell @entity30 about his brother 's death " or the manner of that death , to spare him emotional trauma			1
" @entity8 first learned of the new court documents from multiple local media reports on @entity198			0
suspect : immigration history should not factor in death penalty suspect can see autopsy photos @entity35 marks anniversary , @entity30 awaits trial			0

prosecutors argue that information @entity30 gave to @entity73 should be admissible
