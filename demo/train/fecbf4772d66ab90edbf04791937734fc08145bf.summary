@entity5 @entity3 's highest court has accepted the appeal of three jailed journalists who work for @entity8 and granted them a retrial , the journalists ' lawyers said thursday			1
@entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 were convicted in june of supporting the banned @entity13			2
@entity10 and @entity11 were sentenced to seven years in prison and @entity12 to 10 years			2
the @entity13 , a religious and political group , was banned in @entity3 and labeled a terrorist organization after president @entity17 's ouster in 2013			1
he was @entity3 's first democratically elected leader after the @entity20 uprising			1
tv cameras were not allowed in thursday 's hearing in the @entity23 , and the incarcerated journalists were also absent from the courtroom			2
the men 's families were disappointed at the outcome			0
they had hoped the court would throw out the case and release them or at least free them on bail pending retrial , but they remain behind bars			1
the retrial date has not yet been set			0
" this was not good as we hoped for , " @entity37 , mother of @entity38 journalist @entity10 , told reporters at the court			1
journalist 's letter from @entity5 cell ' i believe in his innocence ' lawyers for the three defendants asked the court for their release but told reporters that the chances were slim			1
@entity11 's lawyers asked for his deportation to @entity56 -- he is @entity3 - @entity56 -- taking advantage of a new law allowing a president to deport defendants			1
the judge overseeing the retrial will decide on their release , said @entity63 , a lawyer for @entity10 and @entity12			1
@entity65 's brothers , @entity66 and @entity67 , expressed mixed feelings about the court 's decision			2
" it 's a step in the right direction			0
obviously , it 's a little disappointing that we did n't get the most positive outcome , but on reflection , it 's certainly the next best result for us , " @entity73 told @entity4 affiliate @entity74			0
but @entity10 's family hopes @entity3 's government will make use of other legal avenues to free his brother @entity83 sooner			1
" following instruction from @entity83 and the family , @entity83 's @entity3 lawyer lodged an application with the @entity3 attorney general 's office to have @entity83 deported , pursuant to a presidential decree that was issued in november , " @entity67 said			1
" we believe there is now a window of opportunity for the @entity3 president to exercise his presidential power under the decree , " he @entity10 said			1
@entity11 's fiancee , @entity97 , said they planned to marry despite his incarceration			0
" we will hold our wedding vows inside the prison , " she said			0
" i believe it 's a message to the whole world that @entity12 is innocent , and i believe in his innocence			0
and it is a personal message to him that i love him and i know that he is innocent			0
" @entity11 's brother , @entity107 , said the whole family had shared in the journalist 's ordeal			1
" it 's the epitome of injustice what happened , " he said			1
" he lost a year and more now of his life			0
we are suffering as a family severely for my brother , as all the families are for their loved ones			0
and i ca n't describe in words what we 've been through this year			0
" ' unjustly in jail ' in a statement issued after the ruling , @entity8 urged @entity3 authorities to move swiftly to a retrial			1
lawyers point out that the appeal process from this point could take another 12 to 18 months , the broadcaster said			0
" @entity12 , @entity83 and @entity132 have been unjustly in jail for over a year now , " an @entity8 spokesman said			2
" the @entity3 authorities have a simple choice -- free these men quickly , or continue to string this out , all the while continuing this injustice and harming the image of their own country in the eyes of the world			1
they should choose the former			0
" there has been wide international condemnation of @entity3 's prosecution of the three journalists , who deny wrongdoing			1
the @entity151 , @entity38 and @entity152 have all called for the men to be freed , as have rights groups including @entity155 , the @entity156 and the @entity157			0
flawed trial the appeal was accepted because of procedural errors in the trial that led to the conviction			2
the men had appeared in a special court created to handle terrorism cases , which may , in retrospect , be considered illegal			0
prosecutors are now expected to present the same case in a new court			0
the three journalists have been imprisoned in @entity5 since december 2013 on charges that included conspiring with the @entity13 , spreading false news and endangering national security			0
they have steadfastly denied the charges , as has @entity8 , and the prosecution put forward no evidence to support the allegations			2
prosecutors were criticized for presenting evidence that was purportedly made up or irrelevant to the case , like videos of @entity65 's old news reports from other countries			0
@entity155 has said that @entity183 , @entity11 and @entity12 are pawns in a geopolitical dispute between @entity3 and @entity186 , the tiny but oil - rich @entity187 country that finances @entity8			1
@entity186 has long been perceived as a supporter of the @entity13 , which was declared a terrorist organization just days before the @entity8 journalists were arrested at the @entity5 hotel where they were working			1
with @entity195 mediation , however , there has been a recent improvement in @entity3 - @entity186 relations			2
president @entity198 met with a @entity186 envoy in december , and the meeting was followed by @entity8 's decision to suspend its @entity3 @entity203 channel			1
this channel is already banned by an @entity3 court and was at the center of the journalists ' trial , even though they work for the network 's @entity210 - language channel			1
@entity97 , @entity11 's fiancee , welcomed the apparent improvement in the two countries ' relations			0
" i hope the reconciliation between @entity3 and @entity186 can lead to a better outcome , " she said			2
" it 's very hard for us to feel that they will stay for a year in prison			0
" journalist @entity225 reported from @entity5 , and @entity4 's @entity226 wrote from @entity227			2
@entity4 's @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 contributed to this report .			0
