-- @entity1 stayed on course to become the first woman to win the @entity4 six times but only just , after surviving a major scare against @entity7			1
at one point , the 13th seed from @entity9 led 6 - 2 , 4 - 1 and seemed to have one foot in the quarterfinals until @entity1 , 31 , displayed the fighting qualities that have made her one of the greats of the game			1
the world @entity16 rallied to win 2 - 6 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 and so book her place in the last eight , where she will take on @entity21 's @entity20 , the fifth seed			1
" i just thought to myself , ' well , i 've been down worse			0
just keep fighting ' , " @entity1 -- whose five crowns are equaled only by @entity26 -- told reporters in @entity28			0
" i never give up			0
it does n't matter whether it 's in life or on the tennis court -- i keep fighting			0
" " i was playing a really good opponent who plays really well			0
she 's a good fighter and a great player , " added the @entity34 , who is seeking her first @entity4 title to add to those won in 2002 - 2004 and 2007 - 2008			0
unfortunately for @entity7 however , the defeat marked the second year in a row where the 23 - year - old has led the world 's best by a significant distance in @entity4 only to fail to make it over the finish line			2
in 2012 , the right - hander led @entity48 6 - 1 , 5 - 2 before succumbing to defeat			0
meanwhile , @entity20 was unconvincing as she made 39 unforced errors in a straight sets defeat of @entity52 teenager @entity51 ( 7 - 6 , 6 - 2 )			1
playing her first tournament since injuring her ankle at january 's @entity55 , @entity20 let both a 5 - 1 lead in the first set -- and then a 6 - 1 lead in the tie break -- slip before dismissing the 19 - year - old who had knocked out @entity61 and @entity62			1
defending champion @entity63 also had trouble making it through as the fourth seed recovered from losing the first set before seeing off the challenge of rising talent @entity67 with a 4 - 6 , 6 - 2 , 6 - 0 win			2
next up for the @entity70 is @entity72 's @entity71 , who saw off @entity74 's @entity73 6 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 3 to continue her best start to a season -- as she reached her fourth quarterfinal of the year			2
in the men 's section , second seed @entity78 saw off the challenge of @entity82 in straight sets ( 7 - 6 , 6 - 3 ) after the @entity84 also let a decent lead slip			1
the 21 - year - old had the chance to win the first set when serving at 5 - 3 but three double faults handed the @entity89 a lifeline			0
it is the second time in as many tournaments that @entity82 has cracked when serving for a set against a top - ranked player , having served four double faults when leading world no. 1 @entity96 5 - 3 at @entity97 earlier this month			1
@entity78 will face @entity99 's @entity98 in the quarterfinals .			2

@entity1 rallies from 2 - 6 , 1 - 4 down to beat @entity7 of @entity9
world no. 1 to face @entity20 of @entity21 in quarterfinals
@entity78 also through after @entity84 's @entity82 *crumbles* against @entity89
