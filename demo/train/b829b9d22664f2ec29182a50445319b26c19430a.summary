@entity0 -- @entity2 looks every bit what he is : a @entity6 scholar			1
with his @entity12 beard , graying hair and a deep , resonant voice enunciating @entity10 tones , he epitomizes gravitas			0
but it 's not his appearance so much as the power of his story			2
for @entity2 is one of the few insiders who dare to speak publicly about something most people in @entity6 only whisper about : the fall of the man once touted as a potential @entity6 president			1
" i know i 'm taking a little risk by agreeing to this interview , " he says			0
" several foreign media have told me they can not find one single person to speak in the vast city of @entity29			1
no one dares go public			0
" why @entity33 scandal might not be all bad all of this plays out in this choking metropolis in southwest @entity6			1
it is a city @entity2 knows well			1
he is a well - known identity , plugged into local politics and personally familiar with the people at the center of this scandal , which has grown to encompass a murder investigation , allegations of spying , and rumored sexual affairs that have led to the sacking of the party chief , who until last month ruled the city with an iron fist			1
@entity2 says it all leads back to @entity50 , a man known in @entity6 as a " princeling , " the son of a communist revolutionary hero			1
why the scandal plays bigger abroad @entity33 saw @entity29 as the place to make his stand			1
he drove out criminal gangs , locking up or executing the ring - leaders			0
all of this to a soundtrack of old - style revolutionary songs and slogans : smash black , sing red he called it			0
on the streets he won praise , but to his critics @entity33 was orchestrating a naked power grab , wiping out rivals and enemies			1
the insider , @entity2 , says the crackdown went too far			1
" extortion of confessions through torture was commonplace -- too many unjust and mistaken cases were made in the process			2
that is for sure , " he says			0
@entity33 fashioned himself on @entity6 's fabled leader @entity79			1
@entity2 says @entity33 tried to recreate the @entity79 era and frightened communist reformers , making new enemies			1
" he 's been playing the role of @entity79 's successor , " he opines			2
" he was visiting @entity86 camps and giving the soldiers @entity79 's bust as a gift			2
" none of the other politicians has ever done that			0
i think it has been a huge misjudgment of @entity33			2
going back to @entity79 's path is definitely not an option			2
that has proven to be a dead end			0
@entity79 led a road to ruin			0
" this particular path has lead to @entity33 's own ruin			1
his inner circle turned on itself			0
in february his police chief fled and sought asylum in a @entity106 consulate			2
diplomatic , political and business sources now paint a picture of a man fearing for his life after linking @entity33 's own wife to the murder of a @entity114 businessman			1
he linked @entity114 firms with @entity6 companies			2
he even did some work for a firm run by former @entity114 spies			0
@entity115 , who was married to a @entity6 woman , then befriended @entity33 and his wife @entity123			1
somewhere it all allegedly went sour			0
rumors now abound , each more sensational and lurid than the last , and equally hard to substantiate			0
but they are explosive : now police suspect @entity33 's wife had @entity115 killed			1
" it 's said in the official report that @entity123 was involved in the murder of @entity115			0
as for her motive , i think it 's either struggling over financial interests or disagreements related to their personal affair , " @entity2 says			1
" it somehow became impossible for @entity123 to end this relationship with @entity115			0
my guess is both factors exist			0
they were involved both financially and romantically			0
" intimate relations , suspected murder , political intrigue : all of it leading to a hotel on the outskirts of @entity29			2
@entity1 gained access and found a place well past its glory days			0
stained walls and bedrooms with worn bedding and chipped furniture			0
but from this rundown hotel , to the corridors of the @entity159 , the downfall of @entity33 and his wife is not just about a family in disgrace			2
@entity2 , the man who wo n't keep quiet , says @entity6 has glimpsed its future			1
on the one hand , a return to @entity79 's cultural revolution with @entity33 personally pushing a hard line rule			1
on the other , greater freedom and reform , a government more responsive to the people with protection for all under the law			0
one leader has fallen , but @entity2 says @entity6 may have taken big steps to saving itself in the process .			1

@entity2 is personally familiar with the people at the center of the @entity50 scandal
@entity33 was *widely* *tipped* to be a future president of @entity6
he says @entity33 's crackdown in @entity29 went too far , with torture commonplace
@entity2 : *demise* of @entity29 party chief may be good for @entity6 itself
