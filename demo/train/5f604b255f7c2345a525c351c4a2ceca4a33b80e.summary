-- a @entity2 journalist who got into @entity3 by using a group of students from a top @entity7 university as camouflage is facing accusations that he recklessly endangered their safety and damaged the school 's reputation			1
@entity2 reporter @entity13 posed as a student from the @entity15 , or @entity15 , on a visit to the secretive nation last month , during which he filmed footage for the broadcaster 's prime - time current affairs show " @entity22			1
" he traveled with his wife and a cameraman			0
officials and student representatives from the @entity15 say @entity13 did n't fully explain the situation to the students he was traveling with in advance , saying only that " a journalist " would join the trip			1
in doing so , they say , he put the students at risk and jeopardized future visits by the school 's academics to @entity3 and other politically sensitive countries			1
" the students were not given enough information to enable informed consent , yet were given enough to put them in serious danger if the subterfuge had been uncovered prior to their departure from @entity3 , " the @entity15 said in a statement			1
the authoritarian @entity3 regime tightly controls who enters its territory , with journalists from the international news media , including @entity0 , often refused entry			2
authorities significantly restrict the movements of those who are allowed in			0
and the penalties for those who break the rules can be severe			0
in 2009 , two @entity58 journalists reporting from the border between @entity3 and @entity60 were arrested and received heavy prison sentences			0
they were released later that year after former president @entity62 flew to @entity3 and met with top officials there			2
the @entity15 students and the @entity2 journalists all returned safely from their trip last month , but some of the students then complained about what @entity13 had done , said @entity70 , the secretary - general of the @entity15 's students union			1
" i think it 's absolutely disgraceful that he put students in that position , " she said sunday in an interview with the @entity2			1
" it 's incredibly reckless			0
" according to @entity70 , the students " were lied to , they were n't able to give their consent			0
" but @entity13 and the @entity2 say the students on the trip were aware of the risks involved			1
" all of them were told twice that a journalist was coming , " he said in a separate interview with the @entity2			0
" i was that journalist , i used my own name			0
" a @entity2 spokesman said in a statement cited by the broadcaster that " the students were all explicitly warned about the potential risks of travelling to @entity3 with the journalist as part of their group			1
this included a warning about the risk of arrest and detention and that they might not be allowed to return to @entity3 in the future			0
" @entity13 did , however , admit that he falsely claimed to be a phd student at the @entity15 in his application to enter @entity3			1
" we go in and we tell a lie to the @entity3 , and i believe that 's journalistically fine and proper , " he said , acknowledging that the @entity3 government is now " very angry " about what happened			0
the @entity15 said that the @entity2 journalists had used a university society to set up the controversial trip			1
" this was not an official @entity15 trip , " @entity113 , the director of the @entity15 , said on his @entity115 account			2
" non-students & @entity2 organized it , used the society to recruit some students , & passed it off			2
" the @entity122 , the student society of the school 's international relations department , said a former @entity15 student had told it about the trip , and as a result it had advertised it on its mailing list and @entity132 page as an opportunity " that may be of interest to our members			1
" " there was no institutional involvement on our part whatsoever and the trip participants were aware of that , " the club said			0
as a result of the situation , the @entity15 said it had asked the @entity2 to withdraw the " @entity22 " tv program , scheduled to be broadcast monday , and to make a full apology -- a request the @entity2 has so far refused			1
" @entity15 is fully supportive of the principle of investigative journalism in the public interest , and applauds the work of journalists in dangerous parts of the world , " the university said			0
" we can not , however , condone the use of our name , or the use of our students , as cover for such activities			0
" in his interview with the @entity2 , @entity13 said the majority of the students who were on the trip supported the " @entity22 " program that he and his team had produced			2
but @entity113 said the program " seems to have found no new information and only shown what @entity3 wants tourists to see			2
" he also said that " producers of ' @entity22 ' seem not to have learned any lessons from recent @entity2 scandals , " an apparent reference to the @entity2 's handling of abuses police say were carried out on the corporation 's premises by the late tv presenter and radio host @entity181			0
that scandal has cost several top @entity2 officials their jobs , including former director - general @entity186 .			2
