-- another @entity2 address , another road trip for president @entity4 to push now - familiar policies that he said he would pursue on his own if @entity6 wo n't cooperate			1
at a @entity7 in suburban @entity8 on wednesday , @entity4 amplified his call for an increase in the minimum wage			1
he then traveled to @entity12 for another event staged around the economy			1
" @entity16 overwhelmingly agree , nobody who 's working full time should ever have to raise a family in poverty , " the president said			2
" and that is why i firmly believe it is time to give @entity23 a raise			0
" @entity4 heads to @entity25 and @entity26 on thursday , continuing a tradition of selling his policy prescription directly to the public after the ceremonial report to the nation			1
@entity32 in his address on tuesday , the president talked a good game of acting on his own if necessary , but his words also showed he knows that true progress depends on cooperation with a divided and recalcitrant @entity6			2
" sometimes we stumble ; we make mistakes ; we get frustrated or discouraged , " he said near the end , seeming to describe 2013 - when his approval ratings dropped			0
" but for more than 200 years , we have put those things aside and placed our collective shoulder to the wheel of progress			0
" it was vintage @entity4 , blending hopeful calls for a unified approach with declarations of presidential independence through executive orders			1
there were the now familiar calls to recalibrate the tax code , spend more to rebuild roads and bridges , bolster education and avoid war if at all possible			0
he said what ? @entity4 's speech explained oratorical skills he brought many to tears with a tribute to @entity67 first class @entity65 , a disabled war veteran who sat next to first lady @entity69 and waved with wounded limbs to a prolonged standing ovation			1
even @entity72 relentlessly critical of the president conceded his oratorical skill			1
" a speech by @entity4 is a lot like sex , " said @entity72 strategist and @entity0 contributor @entity76			1
" the worst there ever was is still excellent			0
" according to a snap @entity0 / @entity84 poll , 44 % of respondents had a " very positive " response to @entity4 's speech , while 32 % described a " somewhat positive " response and 22 % did n't like it at all			1
last year , 53 % of respondents in a similar poll rated their response to the 2013 address as very positive			0
an optimistic goal the underlying theme of @entity4 's fifth @entity2 address was his call for the government to work on behalf of all @entity16 in 2014 , and his pledge to do so even if @entity6 refused to join him in an election year			1
" let 's make this a year of action , " @entity4 said			1
" that 's what most @entity16 want -- for all of us in this chamber to focus on their lives , their hopes , their aspirations			0
" it 's an optimistic goal for a president with a 43 % approval rating entering his sixth year in office and facing a determined opposition in the @entity72 - led @entity113 with congressional elections looming in november			1
search the transcript of @entity4 's speech " what i offer tonight is a set of concrete , practical proposals to speed up growth , strengthen the middle class , and build new ladders of opportunity into the middle class , " @entity4 said			2
" some require congressional action , and i 'm eager to work with all of you			0
but @entity23 does not stand still , and neither will i. " going it alone on issue after issue , he invited @entity6 to work with him but said he also would go it alone			0
@entity4 called for more government support to rebuild the nation 's infrastructure , but also said that " i will act on my own to slash bureaucracy and streamline the permitting process for key projects , so we can get more construction workers on the job as fast as possible			2
" the president also promised an executive order to raise the minimum wage for some government contract workers			1
while the action is relatively narrow and affects less than half a million people , @entity4 urged @entity6 to follow suit for all low - wage workers in @entity23			1
opinion : can @entity4 deliver action on inequality ? @entity72 responds earlier tuesday , house speaker @entity153 chafed at such unilateral action , telling reporters that @entity72 are " just not going to sit here and let the president trample all over us			1
" in the official @entity72 response , rep. @entity159 of @entity160 complained that @entity4 's policies " are making people 's lives harder			1
" " we hope the president will join us in a year of real action -- by empowering people -- not by making their lives harder with unprecedented spending , higher taxes , and fewer jobs , " she said			0
agreeing on immigration one area of possible progress is immigration reform			0
@entity4 got a long ovation when he urged @entity72 in the @entity113 to join democrats in passing a @entity180 plan that got bipartisan support			1
@entity159 also brought up the issue backed by some @entity72 as a way to bolster their weak support among @entity16 , the nation 's largest minority demographic			2
" we 're working on a step - by - step solution to immigration reform by first securing our borders and making sure @entity23 will always attract the best , brightest , and hardest working from around the world , " she said in describing the more limited @entity72 approach to the comprehensive @entity180 measure that includes a path to legal status for immigrants living illegally in the country			2
@entity0 poll : speech watcher reaction less positive than previous years disagreeing on @entity200 on another major reform issue , @entity4 chided @entity72 for trying to undermine his signature health care law that passed in 2010 without @entity72 support			1
he cited the millions of people helped by the reforms that ended denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions among its benefits			0
" the @entity23 people are n't interested in refighting old battles , " @entity4 said			2
" let 's not have another 40 - something votes to repeal a law that 's already helping millions of @entity16			0
... the first 40 were plenty			0
... we all owe it to the @entity23 people to say what we 're for , not just what we 're against			0
" in her response , though , @entity159 continued the @entity72 attack line on the health care reforms as big government run amok and causing harm to people by raising costs and limiting their personal choices of doctors and medical treatment			2
this year 's @entity2 is a defining test for @entity4 the @entity0 / @entity84 poll indicated 59 % of respondents thought @entity4 's policies as presented in the speech would help the economy , a lower figure than in recent years			1
laying out goals @entity4 said he will order the @entity238 to create a new federal retirement savings account called @entity240 , a savings bond that would guarantee " a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in			2
" it will be available to those whose jobs do n't offer traditional retirement savings programs , he said			0
additionally , @entity4 called for : -- eliminating $ 4 billion in tax subsidies for the fossil fuel industries " that do n't need it " and instead " invest more in fuels of the future			2
" -- equal pay for women , noting they make 77 cents for each dollar a man earns , which he called " wrong " and " an embarrassment " to prompt loud and long applause			0
-- setting new fuel standards for @entity23 trucks to help reduce @entity23 oil imports " and what we pay at the pump			0
" -- reworking the corporate tax code			0
he urged @entity6 to work with him to close " wasteful , complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here " and instead " lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs right here at home			0
" -- @entity6 to lift restrictions on transferring detainees from @entity281 so the prison can be closed in 2014			0
@entity4 also reiterated that he will veto any new sanctions bill from @entity6 that would derail talks on preventing @entity285 from developing a nuclear weapon , adding that " for the sake of our national security , we must give diplomacy a chance to succeed			2
" @entity292 : @entity4 's message : a dysfunctional @entity6 , but we 'll get it done anyway increasing minimum wage even as he cited a growing economy and increasing corporate profits , @entity4 said average wages have been flat			1
along with his order raising the minimum wage for workers on federal contracts , @entity4 asked @entity6 to get on board with a @entity305 proposal to raise the federal minimum to $ 10.10 per hour			1
republicans largely oppose any federal increase , saying it will place a burden on employers			0
" this is definitely the president 's agenda and has been for some time now , " said @entity0 chief political correspondent @entity311 , who added it was hard to see how @entity72 would respond any differently than before and therefore , it was hard to see big things happening in 2014			1
@entity317 says @entity305 should do more on poverty @entity0 's : @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 and @entity329 contributed to this report .			0
