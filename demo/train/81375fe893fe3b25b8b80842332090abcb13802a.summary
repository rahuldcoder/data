-- second inaugurals are rarely as fresh and exciting and full of promise as the first			0
when a person is sworn in as president and addresses the world for the first time , there is always the chance that he will keep his promises , uphold the principles he espouses , and fulfill his policy objectives			2
but in a sequel , we have the advantage -- or is it the disadvantage ? -- of having already seen this individual in action			0
so we do n't just hear the words , however pretty they may be			0
we balance them against what we know about the person 's flaws and limitations			0
@entity23 embraces key social justice movements in inaugural address president @entity23 said this during his speech : " that is our generation 's task -- to make these words , these rights , these values -- of life , and liberty , and the pursuit of happiness -- real for every @entity38			1
" and this : " and we must be a source of hope to the poor , the sick , the marginalized , the victims of prejudice -- not out of mere charity , but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes : tolerance and opportunity ; human dignity and justice			2
" and this : " our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving , hopeful immigrants who still see @entity38 as a land of opportunity ; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country			1
" opinion : @entity23 's @entity38 , better than what founders imagined right about there , i realized that @entity23 is perhaps one of the least self - aware presidents we 've ever had			1
he lives in his own world , of lofty ideals and soaring rhetoric			0
but , as he prepares for his second term , he ca n't escape his reality of his first term			0
here is a president who claims to be seeking a new kind of justice for illegal immigrants and their families , and yet he 's deported more than 1.5 million of them and divided thousands of families			1
here is a president who won 71 % of the @entity88 vote , and yet now -- with the departures of interior secretary @entity90 and @entity92 secretary @entity91 -- presides over a @entity93 with no @entity94 serving on it			1
the nominations for the top four @entity93 jobs have already gone out , and three of them went to white males			0
it 's nice to see that group get ahead			0
mr. president , in your speech , you talked about the rights and privileges of @entity38			1
you do know that many illegal immigrants refer to themselves as undocumented @entity38			1
as they see it , they are @entity38 in every way but legal status -- @entity38 whose lives you 're ruining and who you 're depriving of liberty and the pursuit of happiness			1
they are , indeed , to use your words , " marginalized " and your heavy - handed enforcement policies and record number of deportations helped put them on the margins			0
opinion : @entity23 's ringing defense of liberalism you have not done right by this group of people , or the @entity38 - born @entity88 community that claims to support them -- at least in nonelection years			1
nor have you advanced -- through your immigration policies -- the principles of " tolerance and opportunity , human dignity and justice			0
" after all , just who do you think has " expelled " so many of these " striving , hopeful " immigrants from our country ? that 's right , mr. president , you 're the one			2
