-- @entity1 -- joy at the misfortune of others -- is a bad thing			0
so i 've been trying to resist temptation these past months as i watch attorney general @entity9 deal with public and congressional reaction to the " @entity11 " scheme , the failed attempt by the @entity14 to seed and then track @entity16 firearms to @entity18 drug cartels			1
@entity11 was a secretive , high - risk operation seemingly intended to deal with an intractable problem abroad			1
on those grounds , some may be tempted to equate it to a @entity25 covert action			1
but even if some attributes are similar -- tough problem , edgy solution , inherent complexity , great secrecy , high operational and political risk -- it was definitely not a covert action since those are clearly defined in an executive order as the province of the @entity25 beyond that , if it had been a true covert action , the attorney general would have had to give his opinion as to its lawfulness beforehand ; the implementing agency would have had to exhaustively articulate risk ; the @entity45 would have had to judge it favorably ; president @entity47 would have had to authorize it ; and the @entity49 would have had to be briefed before its implementation			1
and all concerned would have had the opportunity to reject a bad idea , whatever its rationale			0
these routine safeguards not only protect agencies , their leaders and their officers from legal and political jeopardy , they also protect the government from serious missteps			0
now @entity9 , without such safeguards in place , must defend himself against some very tough accusations , including one by some skeptics that the operation was intended principally to discredit , and thereby justify further regulation of , firearms dealers			1
this is where the schadenfreude comes in			0
after the congressional elections of 2006 , the @entity25 was forced to defend edgy ( often controversial and sometimes unsuccessful ) actions in a tough political environment			2
president @entity75 was politically weakened , the @entity76 and the @entity77 were under @entity79 control and a presidential election was in the offing			0
@entity83 , the questions were aggressive , often partisan and , in my view , sometimes even deeply mean - spirited and unfair to the many intelligence professionals who were putting their lives and careers on the line in a very successful effort to protect @entity16 from further attack			0
the agency dealt with the committees as best a nonpolitical organization could , fully recognizing that , although congressional oversight was a necessary instrument , it could sometimes be a difficult one			0
but any personal instinct toward some common " executive branch " empathy for @entity9 is muted not only by the dubious character of @entity11 , but by some of the attorney general 's other actions , as well			1
while out of office , for example , he famously called for a " reckoning " for @entity25 officers and other officials who authorized and conducted operations that were edgy and risky and intended to deal with difficult circumstances			1
once in office , he launched a " reckoning " of @entity25 renditions , detentions and interrogations of terrorists by directing the @entity115 to reopen investigations closed years before by career prosecutors			2
this decision was opposed by then - cia director @entity124 and seven of his predecessors , and @entity9 reportedly made the decision without reading detailed memos prepared by those career prosecutors declining to pursue further proceedings			2
the @entity25 officers affected by this may be forgiven some feelings of irony when they now hear the attorney general repudiating some of the charges made against his officers by stating : " those who serve in the ranks of law enforcement are our nation 's heroes and deserve our nation 's thanks , not the disrespect that is being heaped on them by those who see political advantage			1
" of course , it was also @entity9 who decided in 2009 to release what had been secret @entity115 memos outlining the details and providing the legal justification for the @entity75 administration 's interrogation program			2
the release was defended by the administration as part of a broad commitment to " transparency			0
" @entity9 may have had even more in mind though as , according to a contemporary @entity165 account of the decision , the leadership of the @entity115 calculated that " if the public knew the details , ... there would be a groundswell of support for an independent probe , " and that when the decision to release those memos had been made , the attorney general and his leadership team " celebrated quietly , and waited for the national outrage to begin			2
" later that summer , @entity9 also released a previously classified @entity25 inspector general report on the interrogation program as the administration seemed to be actively shaping this story to put its predecessor 's actions in the worst possible light			1
as i said , schadenfreude is a bad thing			0
but it is sometimes hard to avoid , especially when life seems to come full circle			0
attorney general @entity9 has made it clear that he thinks he has been subjected to a heavily politicized process over @entity11			1
if he has -- and that 's still an if -- i suspect that some folks at @entity25 know exactly how he feels			2
follow @entity195 on @entity196 join the conversation on @entity198 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0

former @entity25 director says " @entity11 " operation causing problems for ag @entity9
he says the *scrutiny* is similar to the attention paid to @entity25 covert operations
@entity201 says @entity9 was among those who failed to understand the need for risky operations
he says @entity9 now defends law enforcement " heroes " who " deserve our nation 's thanks "
