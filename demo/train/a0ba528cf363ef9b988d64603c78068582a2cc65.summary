@entity0 -- when asked over the years if he can use executive power to stop deporting illegal immigrants , president @entity2 has responded : yes , we can ! other times , the answer was : no we ca n't ! this week , at the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity2 was heckled by an audience member who was later identified as @entity11 , an undocumented student from @entity12 who graduated from the @entity13 with a degree in political science			1
when @entity11 pleaded with @entity2 to put the brakes on deportations and stop separating families , @entity2 responded : " now , what you need to know , when i 'm speaking as @entity21 and i come to this community , is that if , in fact , i could solve all these problems without passing laws in @entity26 , then i would do so			1
but we 're also a nation of laws			0
that 's part of our tradition			0
" but , on october 26 , 2011 , at the @entity31 , @entity2 said this when talking to students about using an executive order to reduce student loan debt			1
" we 're not going to wait for @entity26			1
i 'm going to act with or without @entity26			1
where they wo n't act , i will , through a series of executive orders			1
... we 're going to look every day to see what we can do without @entity26			1
" and on october 25 , 2010 , on the @entity41 - language radio show , " @entity42 " -- when host @entity43 asked him why he had n't moved faster on immigration reform , @entity2 responded : " i am president , i am not a king			1
i ca n't do these things just by myself			2
we have a system of government that requires the @entity26 to work with the executive branch to make it happen			1
" yet , two years later , while facing re-election and eager to reignite support among @entity52 , @entity2 managed to get something done without @entity26 ' approval			1
on june 15 , 2012 , he announced that his administration was offering @entity56 to allow undocumented young people to temporarily avoid deportation and apply for a two - year work permit			2
speaking from the @entity60 , @entity2 said : " it makes no sense to expel talented young people who , for all intents and purposes , are @entity66			2
... in the absence of any immigration action from @entity26 to fix our broken immigration system , what we 've tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places			2
... effective immediately , the @entity74 is taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people			0
" confused ? join the club			0
@entity2 's immigration schtick is simple			2
he blames republicans for the fact that we do n't have immigration reform			0
@entity85 covers up for democrats in @entity26 who have had a poor record on immigration			2
he insists that his administration is not deporting dreamers or anyone else who is n't a hard - core criminal			0
and -- as he did this week -- he claims that his hands are tied because he needs @entity26 as a dance partner			2
so if a president takes action without @entity26 , he violates the law ? but this is n't true			1
there 's such a thing as the executive order			1
@entity2 has issued 164 executive orders on such things as climate change and student debt			1
it 's a well - worn presidential tool -- @entity108 issued 287 ; @entity109 issued 308			0
in his most recent use of executive power , @entity2 is attempting to tinker with the requirements of the @entity113 so that @entity66 can keep their health plans a while longer			1
the point : when it comes to using the power of the presidency for causes he really cares about , @entity2 is no shrinking violet			2
so he must not care about immigration			0
the audience in @entity9 was n't buying it			0
@entity11 shouted at the president that he had " the power to stop deportations for all " because there are " thousands of families separated every single day			1
" the actual figure is about 1,100 deportations every day if apprehensions and deportations keep pace with the rate in previous years -- roughly 400,000 per year , totaling a record of nearly 2 million since @entity2 took office			1
@entity2 pushed back against @entity11 , insisting that he did n't have the power to stop deporting people or dividing families			1
" that 's why we 're here , " he said			0
other people in the crowd sided with @entity11 and began to shout : " stop deportations ! yes , we can ! " on the defensive , @entity2 unleashed the left 's favorite weapon : condescension			1
" so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like i can do something by violating our laws , " he said			0
" what i 'm proposing is the harder path , which is to use our democratic process to achieve the same goal that you want to achieve			0
but it wo n't be as easy as just shouting			0
it requires us lobbying and getting it done			0
" you know what is an easy way out , mr. president ? not being constrained by core principles because you change your position whenever you need to get out of a scrape			0
after the exchange , @entity11 claimed that he had n't planned to challenge the @entity21 , but that he could n't take it anymore			0
" this is very urgent , " he told reporters			0
" this is the only venue where i could speak out , and i 'm representing the voices of other undocumented students who are actually in the detention center right now and who can not be here			0
this young man is a hero for bravely speaking truth to power			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2

@entity188 wanted president @entity2 to stop deportations with executive order
@entity186 : @entity2 said he could n't make law , yet he has used executive orders before
@entity186 : @entity2 created the @entity56 without @entity26 ' ok
@entity186 says @entity2 acts without @entity26 only on issues *important* to him
