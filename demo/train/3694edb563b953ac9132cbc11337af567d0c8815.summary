by now we 're all familiar with the term @entity1 , the notorious digital currency with dozens of copycats			1
but most of us would find it difficult to imagine actually using this crypto - currency or even picturing what it looks like			0
in fact , only a handful of venues in bustling @entity11 actually accept @entity1 as a means of payment			1
that could be changing though , as the @entity17 's first @entity1 atm machine arrived earlier this year at the @entity19 café and bar in modish @entity11			1
@entity21 set out to find out more about the machine which allows customers to buy coffees and cakes in the café			1
@entity29 founder and café owner @entity27 was already using @entity1 as a form of currency when he decided to install the machine after meeting a fellow enthusiast who pitched the idea to him			1
" i am quite a sci - fi enthusiast and well , immediately i was captivated by the idea of it			0
i saw it as very much the way forward , " @entity27 told @entity21 's @entity38 , at the café in @entity11			1
" i mean , a virtual currency or a digital currency is definitely the way the future of finance is headed , " he said			0
the owner of the machine , @entity46 , said he had the idea to install a machine in @entity27 's café after seeing one at a convention several months ago			1
" i was so amazed by the machine			0
i thought someone might bring one to the @entity17 , " said @entity46			0
" the reason i really like @entity1 is our financial system is very limited			2
we can send music , we can send messages , we can send any type of information , the only thing we ca n't send is money without having to go through banks , " @entity46 told @entity57			0
if it sounds too much like a movement of the anti-establishment , @entity46 is quite sure it 's grown into something much greater than that			0
" it 's about freedom , it 's not about trying to go against something , it 's just about trying to make the world a financial place we 'd like to operate in , " he explained			0
so how does it work ? " we can put a 5 pound note into the @entity79 and it will give you a value of @entity1 that exchanges to that value of 5 pounds , " explained @entity27			1
@entity27 said he trades in thousandths of a @entity1 , meaning it is perfectly acceptable to pay for coffees by paying 0.001 of a @entity1			2
each milli - @entity1 is a thousandth of a @entity1			2
" it 's a very simple process , " said @entity46 , who explained that after pressing the start button , the consumer then scans a qr code on their phone which is linked to their @entity1 wallet online			2
the final step is to simply insert money into the note acceptor			2
while only about 1 - 2 per cent of @entity97 's customers currently buy with @entity1 , he still sees this as the way forward			1
@entity46 could n't agree more			0
" we now have online banking , we now have chip and pin , we pay with wire transfers over the internet			0
in fact , very few people are using cash these days , " says @entity46			0
" @entity1 is just a smarter step into empowering ourselves to control this digital money , " he said .			1

a cafe in @entity11 has installed the *country* 's first @entity79 machine
the machine takes money and *dispenses* @entity1 which is then used to buy cakes and coffees
owner says the machine is one step further in controlling our own money
