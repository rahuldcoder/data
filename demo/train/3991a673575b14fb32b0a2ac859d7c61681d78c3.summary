-- there 's plenty of gay - rights news to celebrate this week : -- on monday , a federal judge threw out @entity6 's ban on same - sex marriages , writing that his decision was one in support of " families committed to the common purpose of love , devotion and service to the greater community			1
" -- on tuesday , the same thing , more or less , happened in @entity17 , with a judge in that case writing that " we are a better people than what these laws represent , and it is time to discard them into the ash heap of history			2
" ( i mean , wow , right ? ) -- and , for those would might say " activist judges " are behind all of this progress , please note that @entity31 on wednesday released data showing 55 % of @entity33 -- a greater percentage than ever shown in that group 's polling -- support same - sex marriage rights			1
so , in summary : the era of same - sex marriage is upon us ; even those who grimaced at @entity45 player @entity44 's boyfriend kiss probably can see that ; and , therefore , all 's well that ends well			1
well , not so much			0
in the march toward marriage equality , the @entity33 skipped over other rights that are more fundamental and perhaps more essential for @entity53 people			1
consider three facts : 1			0
it 's legal for employers to fire gay and lesbian people because of their sexual orientation in not one or two fringe states but in 29 of them , according to the @entity62 , a gay rights advocacy group that tracks these things			1
that 's a majority of states where it 's legal to fire someone simply for being gay			1
" it 's important to note that , while same - sex couples can legally marry today in @entity17 , they can actually be fired from their jobs for talking about their new spouses at work , " @entity69 , spokesman for @entity62 , wrote in an e-mail to me			1
related : no one should be fired for being gay 2			0
related to that , there also are 29 states where it 's legal for landlords to evict gay and lesbian residents simply because of their sexual orientation			1
that 's true not just of places such as @entity90 but also states with more progressive reputations , such as @entity17 and @entity92			1
some states make it onerously difficult , if not impossible , for transgender people to legally change their names and update the gender that 's listed on their state @entity98 or driver 's license			2
maybe that sounds inconsequential , but consider going to the airport with an @entity98 that does n't match who you are and having to explain your gender identity to a @entity107 agent			0
" there are 15 ( states ) that we would give an f " on these issues , said @entity108 , director of policy at the @entity110			0
progress is coming but much too slowly in some cases			0
the first employment nondiscrimination laws were passed in @entity119 and @entity120 , @entity92 , according to @entity122 's " a @entity121			0
" the year was 1972			0
a range of cities and corporations have come up with their own nondiscrimination policies and rules in the decades since , but state and federal movement has been sluggish			0
the @entity132 passed the @entity133 last year but has been a nonstarter in @entity135 , thanks to speaker @entity137			0
to be fair , there are campaigns from lgbt rights groups to put in place these basic protections			2
the @entity62 , for instance , started @entity143 to " dramatically expand @entity53 equality in the @entity145 , " including freedom from discrimination , which is rampant in that region			2
but it 's clear marriage equality has been the primary focus , for the public , activists and for the news media			2
there are some reasonable explanations for that			0
some would argue , for instance , that campaigns for marriage equality have helped people realize gay and lesbian people are loving and family - oriented -- and that greater protections will follow that awakening			1
i hope that 's right , but it 's no sure thing			0
we 're starting to see ourselves in @entity33 as a beacon of progressiveness and opportunity for @entity53 people			1
but we also need to acknowledge the reality -- which is that this also is a country where basic protections remain worryingly absent .			2

@entity179 : the @entity33 lacks some very basic protections for @entity53 people
he says good news on same - sex marriage should n't *distract* from that
judges in @entity17 and @entity6 this week *overturn* marriage bans
@entity179 : it 's still legal for employers in 29 states to fire people for being gay
