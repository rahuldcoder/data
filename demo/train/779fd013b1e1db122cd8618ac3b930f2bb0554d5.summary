-- @entity3 troops could begin pulling out of @entity4 in the coming months , and the majority of them may leave the country by the end of next year , prime minister @entity1 said tuesday			1
it 's the latest announcement of international troop drawdowns in @entity4 , a trend that signals the coalition 's confidence in the country 's fighting forces , the transition to @entity4 security control , and the war 's growing unpopularity in the countries that contribute troops			1
@entity1 made her remarks tuesday ahead of a @entity22 summit meeting in @entity23 in may			0
at the meeting , the leaders of countries with troops in @entity4 will make key decisions about the future of the international coalition 's mission there			1
@entity3 's move would mean that most of the more than 1,500 @entity3 soldiers in @entity4 could leave a year earlier than the government had previously suggested			1
that timetable puts @entity3 forces on a quicker withdrawal timetable than @entity1 had previously described			1
in a speech to parliament in november , she said the transition in @entity43 might well be completed before the end of 2014			0
" we continue to see steady gains in the fight against the @entity4 insurgency , " @entity1 said in a speech in @entity46 , suggesting that the strategy of international forces in the country had led to " security gains over the past year and a half			1
" she highlighted the progress made by @entity4 troops , notably in the southern province of @entity43 , where most of the @entity3 forces are concentrated			1
@entity1 said she expected the @entity4 president , @entity59 , to make an announcement in the coming months about beginning the process of putting @entity4 troops in charge of security in @entity43 and other provinces , a transition that should take 12 to 18 months			1
" and when this is complete , @entity3 's commitment in @entity4 will look very different to that we have today , " she said , adding that " the majority of our troops will have returned home			1
" @entity1 said @entity3 will maintain a police training role and " provide niche training " to the @entity76 after 2014			1
" we are prepared to consider a limited @entity78 contribution in the right circumstances and under the right mandate , " she said			0
" there may be a continuing role to train the @entity76 to conduct -- and to work alongside them in carrying out -- counterterrorism operations in @entity4			1
" @entity3 has been among those nations that have contributed troops , supplies and other resources to the @entity22 - led military effort in @entity4 , which began in the weeks after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks			1
@entity91 , senior analyst at @entity92 , a @entity93 - based think tank , said @entity3 has been a " phenomenal " ally			1
its special forces contingent in @entity43 has been responsible for numerous high - level kill and capture operations , and the military has trained and mentored @entity4 security forces , @entity91 said			1
" they should be commended for their role , " @entity91 said			0
he noted that it would be " a shame to see regression " in @entity43 because of what appears to be a " hard and fast move			0
" @entity91 hopes the transition will be phased , careful and " condition - based " to avoid any setbacks			0
" it 's important they do this in a judicious way			2
i hope they 'll do that			0
it helps to have the weight of the @entity22 mandate behind it , " he said			0
he also said such moves could influence other coalition countries to make similar moves			2
@entity3 's 1,550 troops in @entity4 are a fraction of the overall number of foreign troops deployed to keep a lid on the country 's insurgency more than 10 years after allied airstrikes marked the start of @entity133			1
the number of @entity3 soldiers killed in the war stands at 32 , according to a @entity0 count			2
more than 130,000 troops from 50 countries are currently operating in @entity4 , according to the @entity140			2
the international force has been there since 2001 , shortly after the @entity143 terror attacks on the @entity144			0
the campaign was launched to stop the @entity146 from providing a safe haven for @entity143 fighters and to stop the terror group 's use of @entity4 as a base for its future activities			1
the @entity144 is the biggest contributor , providing about 90,000 troops , followed by the @entity155 with 9,500 , @entity156 with 4,800 troops and @entity158 with 3,600			0
in june 2011 , @entity144 president @entity159 announced that @entity144 combat operations in @entity4 would end by 2014			2
at that time , there were more than 100,000 @entity144 troops in the country after a 30,000 - strong troop " surge " in december 2009 to help bolster the campaign against the @entity146			2
in february , @entity144 defense secretary @entity167 announced that the @entity144 hoped to end its combat mission in @entity4 in 2013 , transitioning primarily to a training role as @entity4 forces take more responsibility for security			2
@entity158 announced in february that it would begin an early drawdown , and its troops would be gone by 2013			0
@entity156 plans to pull out some troops next year , with the remainder leaving in 2014			0
@entity155 plans to hand over its security operations to local forces by the end of 2013 before continuing in a " supporting role " from 2014			0
some countries have already pulled out			0
@entity183 , which once headed the @entity140 mission , removed almost all of its 3,000 soldiers at the end of 2011			0
@entity188 also withdrew almost all of its 500 troops during this period			0
@entity0 's @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 contributed to this report .			2
