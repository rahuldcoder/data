-- it 's one thing to sing about a motorcycle , and it 's another to sing about a unicorn			2
but when you put your motorcycle song and your unicorn song in the same song ? and call it " @entity9 ) " ? now that 's a pop visionary			0
@entity11 knew it was time to crank up the crazy , and she did n't hold back : " @entity13 " is her @entity15 arena - rock move , going for maximum goth @entity17 bombast			1
the whole album thumps like the soundtrack to a lost " @entity25 " sequel , one where @entity22 gets crucified by @entity24 soldiers , while @entity11 stands under the cross weeping and sending dirty texts to the @entity28 " @entity13 " has all the electro - sleaze beats and @entity31 chorus chants that made her the @entity32			1
but the big surprise is the way @entity11 pillages the @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity39 records of her childhood			1
in the 1980s , radio was full of tormented @entity17 kids , from @entity43 to @entity44			0
@entity11 clearly grew up on that stuff			1
she does n't just give her @entity44 homage " @entity49 " a sax solo -- she gets @entity47 himself to play it			0
exclusive : how @entity52 saxophonist @entity47 ended up on @entity11 's @entity53 all over " @entity13 , " she takes on the big topics dear to her heart : sex , religion , muscle cars , her hair			1
she sings in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and whatever language wants to claim " punk - tious			0
" she seduces men , women , deities and dead presidents			0
( " put your hands on me / @entity70 " -- hey , it rhymes			0
) and in " @entity72 , " @entity11 purrs the immortal pickup line " i want your whiskey mouth / all over my blond south			1
" some songs are already familiar -- at this point you could hum the tarzan - boy yodels of " @entity79 " in your sleep			0
but the singles gain resonance on the album , where they 're surrounded by similar - minded psychosexual turmoil			2
" @entity13 " pulls an expert ( expletive ) - stole - my - look on @entity43 's " @entity88			1
" but that is n't even the most brazen @entity43 rip here : that honor goes to " @entity79			0
" and if you thought the @entity17 angst of " @entity79 " was over-the - top , check out " @entity94 , " where @entity11 does the @entity95 to a chic bass line			1
@entity11 's ' @entity13 ' : a @entity97 what makes " @entity13 " so disarmingly great is how warm and humane @entity11 sounds			1
there is n't a subtle moment on the album , but even at its nuttiest , the music is full of wide - awake emotional details			2
the friendliest cut is " @entity109 , " her love song to a " cool @entity108 guy			0
" she has been playing it live for a while , but who knew she would let @entity113 put " @entity114 " drums all over it ? or bring in @entity118 's @entity117 to play guitar ? all that excess just amps up the emotion in the song , especially when @entity11 wails , " there 's only three men that i 'm - a serve my whole life / it 's my daddy and @entity108 and @entity127			2
" @entity11 loves overheated cosmic statements for the same reason she loves dance pop and metal guitars -- because she hears them as echoes of her twisted rock & roll heart			2
that 's the achievement of " @entity13 " : the more excessive @entity11 gets , the more honest she sounds			1
