-- @entity1 stylist @entity1 traces her gift - wrapping prowess to her mother , whose creative , budget - conscious ideas -- like wrapping boxes with painted newspaper comics , pasting gift certificates inside hollowed - out books , and making decorative stamps out of eraser carvings -- proved that a little thoughtfulness goes a long way			1
" she really understood presentation , " @entity1 says			1
" her creativity could turn even inexpensive gifts into something fabulous			2
" now @entity18 has her own cost - saving tricks			2
to achieve a chic , monochromatic effect , she says , " let leftovers be your guide			2
" if you have lime - colored ribbon from @entity25 , use green paper			1
and forget traditional holiday color combinations : pair pink with red , yellow with gold			0
keep it monochromatic combining any two shades of the same color " is a straightforward scheme that looks really modern , " says @entity1			1
fyi : @entity37 , solid - color papers tend to cost less			0
@entity0 : how to personalize your gift wrap 2			1
add nontraditional accents unexpected finishing touches are likely sitting idle in your drawers and closets			0
instead of tying a bow , use cord to attach an ornament or dreidel ; pin a brooch or faux flower onto ribbon ; top children 's gifts with chocolate coins or a glued - on toy			1
@entity18 particularly loves to decorate with alphabet stamps , spelling out the recipient 's name or initials , because " they instantly make a present feel personalized			1
" how to make your own stamps what you 'll need : 1			1
a rubber eraser ( at least two inches wide ) or a large potato sliced in half widthwise			0
a marker to draw a simple shape on the eraser or sliced potato			0
an x-acto knife to carve away the eraser ( or a kitchen knife for the potato ) , leaving the raised shape			0
water - based paint -- or a leftover can of acrylic wall paint , diluted in a bowl			0
brush the paint onto your carving , test it on scrap paper , and stamp up your ribbon , paper , etc. , in random patterns			1

@entity0 : how to tie a bow 3			2
think outside the white cardboard box pick up colorful , inexpensive containers from stores like @entity93 , or use @entity95 - takeout cartons from a party store ( perfect for cookies and candy , ) tea towels or scarves ( ideal for wine bottles and other odd - shaped offerings , ) and @entity104 - badge sleeves ( fun holders for gift cards			0
) " you do n't need wrapping paper if you have pretty fabric or containers , " @entity1 says			1
