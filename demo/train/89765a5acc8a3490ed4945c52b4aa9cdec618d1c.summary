-- more than 2,700 @entity0 readers have shared what they think of @entity4 's letters which were released thursday			1
many who left comments said they were fascinated that @entity4 had apparently been strategizing about how to promote @entity7 using media , and how his approach seems similar to any marketing agency or political party			1
others carefully read the full documents @entity0 posted and responded with a variety of theories about them			2
the total pages released thursday were a drop in the bucket compared to the trove the @entity22 government says it confiscated from the @entity24 compound where @entity4 was killed in may 2011			1
thursday 's release included 17 letters totaling 175 pages			1
officials said they would release the remaining documents later , but would not say when			2
@entity4 's marketing focus @entity4 's letters showed he was focused on how @entity7 could use the media to attract more members			1
for example , he recommended to followers that @entity7 consider reaching out to @entity36 and @entity22 media to deliver the terror group 's message on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks			1
@entity4 's writings also reveal he wanted to launch a publicity campaign to draw people to @entity7 who " have not yet revolted " during the @entity47 uprisings			1
@entity0 reader @entity48 said : " interesting to see how much emphasis @entity4 placed on the media campaign			1
crafting messages to incite revolt for the 10th anniversery of 9/11 and during the @entity47 seemed to be a priority of his while holed up in his compound			2
trying to implement the media as a weapons system while popping @entity59 and dying his beard as the fledgling @entity7 network crumbled around him			2
" poster tinwatchman weighed in : " the war against @entity7 has never really been just about the bombs and guns			2
it 's been fought inside people 's heads			2
we 're not just fighting @entity4 , we 're fighting the story that he 's telling people : that this war is against @entity75 and @entity75 , that it 's like the @entity77 come all over again , and that any @entity78 who wants dignity and freedom by definition must be against the @entity22 , when the truth of the matter is -- at our best , anyway -- the @entity22 really does n't * care * what religion you are ... " @entity88 , another reader , thought about who might be listening to @entity4 's message			1
" i felt like a filthy devil just reading what little i did			2
makes me sick to think that people read that tripe and believed it			0
" rebranding @entity7 other readers were intrigued by an @entity7 memo discussing changing the group 's name which means " @entity102 " and is associated with mujahedeen battles with the @entity100 in 1980s @entity101			1
@entity7 thought it might be better to go with , for example , " @entity104			0
" " @entity4 was worried that the name made it too easy to disassociate @entity7 from @entity75 -- and thus from @entity4 's self - appointed position as @entity75 's representative			1
doing so allowed @entity110 and the @entity22 to move away from the kind of ' cosmic war ' between @entity113 and @entity75 that @entity114 wound up falling into during the @entity116 war , " tinwatchman wrote			0
" that holy war pattern is something that @entity4 was entirely comfortable with -- something he thrived on			1
in a lot of ways , taking that story away from him is one of the most important moves @entity110 made			0
" @entity125 said it was " jarring " to hear the word " brand " used in reference to @entity7			2
" on one level , one could consider it an abomination to use this word so casually			0
a terrorist organization is far different than a toothpaste			0
" " i believe we should use language which draws distinctions between methods utilized by institutions of horrific violence and those deploying commonplace capitalist methodologies , " @entity125 wrote			0
" while it may contribute to establishing a commentators cognoscenti credentials to re-purpose common words in this way , one should be ever vigilant in thinking carefully about how the use or words can positively or negatively impact our perceptions of the world			0
" theorists and skeptics several commenters suspected the @entity22 government fabricated or manipulated the letters or parts of them			2
@entity158 : " are we to believe that no documents in this ' treasure trove ' have revealed exactly how @entity4 managed to end up hiding in that @entity24 compound , as well as @entity162 had been protecting him for all the time he was there ? " where is the smoking gun , the poster asks			1
" or will that information be ' strategically released ' at an ' appropriate moment ' to confirm @entity24 's complicity ? " lt. col. @entity172 , director of the @entity173 which published the documents , gave an advance quote to @entity0 prior to the thursday release of the documents			2
the @entity173 published an analysis of the documents			0
" as for @entity24 , the discussion in the documents is scarce and therefore inconclusive , " @entity172 said			0
" there are no explicit references to any institutional @entity24 support for @entity7 or its operatives			0
" @entity186 wrote : " how do we know the documents are n't just another made up lie ? they 've lied about everything else			0
" @entity192 posted : " @entity110 has done well , at least tactically			0
pulling out troops before further escalation of deaths , a successful raid or at least a drama that is convincing to many , except the @entity24 themselves			0
and now the documents , even if forged , sends a clear message ... we are pulling out and our work is over			0
" " people actually trust that these documents are genuine and not manipulated for political means ? really ? revoke their voting cards , " posted 55reasons			0
" this is all such timely horse s * * * *			0
@entity110 flies to @entity101 to tell the @entity22 stormtroopers their liberation is near			0
suddenly we hear about @entity4 's remorse for his failures and misdeeds			1
those documents in @entity22 hands ...			0
we are to believe that they are telling us his truth			0
yeah , right the check is in the mail ... " finding the humor some readers found @entity4 's letters simply amusing , if not downright funny			1
@entity226 : i just read a bunch of the letters , i had no idea @entity4 was that us ! boy that guy was on a holy terror ! his poetry was awful though ... no cadence			1
anyway , i guess it really does n't mater now ... he 's dead			2
@entity238 : lol these docs are so hilarious			0
they 're all about " oh dear brother , @entity243 protect you , @entity241 loves you , in the name of @entity246 and @entity243 ... " and then " rip out their eyes and let the blood from their tainted bodies flood the streets "			0
@entity254 : laughed out loud at this comment from the letter from @entity257 about the anniversary of 9/11 , speaking about @entity22 news channels : " from the professional point of view , they are all on one level -- except @entity263 which falls into the abyss as you know , and lacks neutrality too			0
" @entity267 wrote that reading @entity4 's letters recalls the everyday writing of @entity270 or the @entity272 shooters			1
" we tend to mythologize people like @entity4 -- be it as a hero , a villain , or a monster			1
in @entity4 's case , it seems to me that he deliberately tried to build up his own legend			1
but looking into these letters tends to reinforce just how ridiculously human he really was underneath it all			2
( what was it they said about @entity288 ? " the banality of evil " ? ) " it 's easier , in a lot of ways , to pretend that only a monster or a caricature could do the sort of things that @entity4 did			1
to know and accept that actual feeling , thinking human beings can commit such acts ? that 's hard			2
" drone strikes strike a chord the letters reveal that @entity4 was instructing his followers to be careful because @entity22 drone strikes were hurting @entity7			1
" the government needs to step up these drone strikes because from the documents it shows that those drones had @entity4 all shook up , " understandingoverignorance wrote			1
@entity314 : " ten years after 9/11 , we still go about our daily lives without constantly worrying about when the next bomb will go off or next attack will come			0
the men who plotted that attack ( those that are still alive ) live in constant fear of when our drones or spec - ops teams will find them			0
this is how we should fight the war on terror ; this is how we will win it			0
" a poster claiming to be an @entity326 sergeant deployed in @entity101 wrote : " @entity327 ! it would be nice if they could take care of it with the use of @entity333 alone , but unfortunately we have to be on the ground in many situations , to guide our precise munitions			0
too many years over here			0
" @entity4 on @entity337 @entity4 's correspondence shows that he instructed his followers to try to kill president @entity110 but to leave vice president @entity337 alone			1
@entity337 is " unprepared for that post , " according to one letter			1
if @entity110 were killed and @entity337 took control of the @entity343 , @entity4 wrote , it would " lead the @entity22 into a crisis			1
" @entity346 posted about @entity4 : " well , i guess he was n't wrong about everything			1
" @entity349 wrote : " i love how @entity4 and his like believe the rest of the world is as black and white as theirs is			1
( if ) @entity110 would have been assassinated , the @entity22 pop. would have rallied and united behind @entity337 and our military in a way that has n't been seen in the 1940 's			1
we disagree on policy -- there is no lack of nationhood			0
