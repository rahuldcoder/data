-- it was wet , cold and windy , and he had n't been in contention to win golf 's oldest tournament for 10 years , but @entity6 finally made the breakthrough at the @entity8 on sunday			1
two decades after he first entered the season 's third major event , the 42 - year - old made history as he triumphed by three shots from @entity15 @entity14 and @entity16 in its 140th staging at @entity19 in @entity20			1
@entity6 , whose previous best finish was runner - up in 1997 , lifted the coveted @entity23 at his 21st attempt -- breaking the record of the tournament 's previous longest wait , the 15 - try streak that @entity30 @entity29 snapped in 1994			1
he is the oldest @entity8 winner since @entity32 's 1967 victory aged 44 , and the oldest of any major champion since 43 - year - old @entity35 won the @entity36			1
ugly and unforgiving : why @entity37 offers golf 's toughest test " it 's been a long and bumpy road , i have had some good things happen to me and some bad things , but i 've had so much support from an awful lot of people , " @entity6 said at the prize - giving ceremony			1
" i 'd like to thank my parents and my fiancee @entity50 , and there 's someone up there watching as well			0
to everybody , thank you very much			0

@entity6 dedicated his victory to his sons @entity90 and @entity91 , who were back in @entity57 where the family has returned after years living in @entity93			2
" it 's for the kids			0
they played @entity97 ( golf course ) this morning and were watching on tv , " he said			0
@entity6 , who last finished in the top - 10 when he placed third at @entity100 & @entity101 's in 2001 , could afford to bogey the final two holes as he carded a level - par 70			2
it was his worst score in four rounds at the links course , which has been buffeted by the weather this week , as he took home the $ 1.45 million first prize to the cheers of the crowd in @entity111			0
having started the final day one shot ahead of 27 - year - old @entity16 , @entity6 faced a strong challenge from fellow 40 - something @entity14			1
the left - hander , seeking to add the @entity8 to his three masters and one @entity117 crown , carded three birdies and an eagle to grab a share of the lead			2
but @entity6 restored his advantage as he also picked up two shots at the par - five seventh and then rattled off nine successive pars despite the difficult conditions , while his main rivals faltered			2
@entity14 's challenge fell apart at the 11th hole , where he missed a routine short par putt			0
more bogeys followed at 13 , 15 and 16 as he finished with a 68 to be two - under 278 for the tournament			0
@entity16 , seeking his first major title , drove out of bounds at the 14th and his double - bogey there handed @entity6 a four - shot buffer			1
he also dropped a shot at 18 to fall back level with @entity14			0
first - round leader @entity139 , whose father died in may , finished fourth on 279 after the 40 - year - old @entity141 closed with 71			1
he was followed by three @entity15 -- @entity142 ( 72 ) , @entity143 ( 70 ) and @entity144 ( 69 ) -- who were tied for fifth on 280			0
@entity146 's @entity145 was eighth on 281 , while @entity148 's @entity147 , @entity20 @entity149 and @entity15 @entity83 captain @entity150 tied for ninth on 282			0
