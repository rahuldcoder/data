i have never bothered @entity2 , although i have had endless chances			1
many times , i 've looked across the broom sage behind my parents ' @entity7 home toward the town where she lives , and i have wondered : what is she up to ? why has one of @entity15 's most cherished authors fallen so silent for so long ? so the latest news landed like a thunderclap in my @entity19 feed : she has a new book			1
readers have waited for those words almost my entire life			1
@entity2 's first novel , " @entity28 , " came out in 1960 as the nation was rising into the @entity27			1
her story of a young girl named @entity32 , her wise father , @entity34 , and the racially charged events in fictitious @entity28 , @entity7 , resonated widely			1
a hit movie followed , and over the decades , 30 million copies of the book sold worldwide			2
the new book will continue the story of @entity32 " some 20 years later " according to a release from the @entity41			2
oddly , this sequel was written before " to kill a mockingbird			2
" a quote from @entity2 on the publisher 's website says , " in the mid- 1950s , i completed a novel called ' go set a @entity48			1
' it features the character known as @entity32 as an adult woman , and i thought it a pretty decent effort			2
" my editor , who was taken by the flashbacks to @entity32 's childhood , persuaded me to write a novel from the point of view of the young scout			1
i was a first - time writer , so i did as i was told			1
" the manuscript for " @entity63 , " she says , was unexpectedly rediscovered and " after much thought and hesitation , i shared it with a handful of people i trust and was pleased to hear that they considered it worthy of publication			2
i am humbled and amazed that this will now be published after all these years			2
" she is not alone in her amazement			2
shortly after " @entity28 " rose to fame , the author took flight from the public eye			1
why ? no one really knew			0
some speculated that bad feelings had boiled up over rumors that her longtime friend , @entity82 , had played a strong role in crafting the story			0
others wondered whether fame was just too much to bear			0
but everyone waited for her next novel			0
and when it did not come after years , then decades , most assumed it never would			0
when i graduated from high school in 1978 , i lived in that house with my parents not far from @entity2 's home in @entity97 , @entity7			1
i could have hopped into my @entity98 , driven an hour and knocked on her door			0
but like a great many other @entity15 , i had no idea she was alive			0
my mother did n't either , although she is almost the same age as @entity2 , and her own childhood down a red dirt road could have been a missing chapter in the famous novel			1
my mother even recalls her older brother , @entity109 , telling her back when @entity2 's story was published that " a woman from @entity97 wrote a book , " as if he were mentioning a school classmate			1
@entity2 , who is now 88 , has often been described as reclusive			1
that is not the right word			0
she has emerged now and then to accept awards			0
for many years , she shuttled between a home in @entity120 and @entity97 , keeping an active and lively circle of family and friends			0
she just did n't speak to the press			0
she did n't " do " public appearances much			0
and , by all accounts , she did not want to talk about her famous book			0
she essentially told all who asked that the work spoke for itself			0
what 's more , her circle helped guard her privacy			1
@entity133 wrote a compelling , unauthorized biography called " mockingbird : a portrait of @entity2 , " and he noted the many ways in which people close to her tried to shoo him off the subject			1
nonetheless , i thought repeatedly over the years that i should try to score the impossible interview			0
a close friend had a connection to the arts community in @entity97 ; maybe he could open a line of communication			0
perhaps a series of nice letters would do the trick			0
or maybe i should just wander up as @entity2 tended her flowers , and say " hi , my family 's home is over near @entity157			1
i went to school at @entity159			0
can we share a glass of iced tea ? " i never did			0
i knew she wanted to be left alone , and the @entity165 manners with which i 'd been raised -- the same she grew up with -- kept me away			1
and unless she suddenly announces a return to public life with this new novel , out of respect i will continue to keep my distance			1
and i suspect i will read this new novel at arm 's length , too			2
not merely because my own vision has faded a bit through all the waiting , but also because she has surely grown larger in my imagination than any human can actually be			2
her talent has been magnified in the public eye by years of unbroken focus on a single , spectacular piece of writing			0
follow - ups to greatness so rarely work out as we hope			2
so , like @entity191 , i am eager to peek into @entity32 's world again , but i will do so from behind a half - pulled curtain , timidly , for fear of what i might see -- and for fear of scaring the mockingbird off once more .			1

@entity1 's @entity195 grew up not so *terribly* far from @entity2 in @entity7
like many others , he spent most of his life hoping and waiting for another novel from the publicity - shy author
