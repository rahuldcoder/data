@entity2 " thank you , " said the man			1
i was standing outside of the offices of @entity6 covering the aftermath of the terrorist attacks for @entity3			1
he was thanking me just for being here , just for covering the event and its aftermath , what @entity14 referred to as @entity16 's september 11			1
and his appreciation was echoed by @entity16 citizen after @entity16 citizen			1
the rally sunday for unity drew 1.5 million people in @entity2 and more than twice that nationwide ; it was like nothing i 've ever seen or covered			1
our nation 's oldest ally stood firm			0
a young @entity28 held a sign saying " @entity30			0
" a man and his son came over to me holding a sign saying " i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it , " beseeching me to share their message with the @entity41 people			1
and world leaders were standing together amidst a procession that included @entity44 of @entity16 , @entity45 of @entity46 , @entity47 of @entity48 , @entity49 of the @entity50 and @entity51 of @entity52 , along with the leaders of @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			1
it is no small thing for the king of @entity55 , a direct descendent of the @entity61 , to march in a rally prompted by the murders of people who mocked @entity65 as well as of innocent @entity66 -- all of whom were killed by @entity65 extremists			0
the @entity41 , which considers itself to be the most important nation in the world , was not represented in this march -- arguably one of the most important public demonstrations in @entity74 in the last generation -- except by @entity41 ambassador @entity76 , who may have been a few rows back			1
i did n't see her			0
even @entity79 sent foreign minister @entity80			0
i say this as an @entity41 -- not as a journalist , not as a representative of @entity3 -- but as an @entity41 : i was ashamed			1
i certainly understand the security concerns when it comes to sending president @entity86 , though i ca n't imagine they 're necessarily any greater than sending the lineup of other world leaders , especially in aggregate			0
but i find it hard to believe that collectively president @entity86 , vice president @entity93 , secretary of state @entity94 , secretary of defense @entity95 , treasury secretary @entity97 and attorney general @entity98 -- who was actually in @entity16 that day for a conference on counterterrorism -- just had no time in their schedules on sunday			2
@entity98 had time to do the sunday shows via satellite but not to show the world that he stood with the people of @entity16 ? there was higher - level @entity86 administration representation on this season 's episodes of " @entity111 " on @entity112			2
i get that the president visited the @entity16 embassy in @entity115 and that secretary of state @entity94 spoke in @entity16 , and i certainly understand that the @entity41 commitment to security in @entity74 rivals no other			1
but with all due respect , those are politicians spending money that they did n't earn and sending troops whom they do n't know			0
and this is not just a matter of the current occupant of the @entity128			0
i find it hard to believe that speaker of the house @entity130 and new senate majority leader @entity132 had more worthy pursuits on sunday than standing side - by - side with our @entity16 brothers and sisters as they came together in an inspirational way			2
after september 11 , the first world leader to visit the @entity41 was @entity16 's @entity140 , though the most forceful conversation about @entity16 in @entity142 that i can recall came a few years later during debate over whether to invade @entity144 and revolved around renaming pommes frites in the @entity147 cafeteria			1
and i 'm frankly floored that not one of the people who is contemplating running for president in 2016 has yet to even tweet on the subject of the momentous demonstration in @entity2 , much less attend @entity16 's biggest rally in the history of the republic			1
i imagine that @entity156 and her husband are kicking themselves for not hopping on a corporate jet to get here			0
can you picture @entity156 and @entity162 walking in the front row , arm - in - arm with @entity51 and @entity44 ? @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 attended the @entity170 - @entity169 football game sunday and at least one of them sent his potential rivals mischievous tweets as if they were contemplating running for president of @entity176			0
and jeb ? @entity177 ? crickets			0
why ? i hope it 's not @entity41 arrogance , a belief that everyone should express shock when something bad happens to us but that our presence at an international rally is worth less than a ticket to the @entity170 game when the victims speak in accents we do n't understand			1
i suppose there 's always the risk that coming to an event like this as an @entity41 leader and getting stuck in the third row could be embarrassing or could lead to accusations that you 're trying to capitalize on a tragedy			2
but that 's not how it would have been interpreted in @entity16			2
people here are happy that @entity41 care			2
they 're eager and appreciative of any evidence of that			0
and i know it exists -- although @entity41 @entity209 seemed much more focused on the @entity210 than anything else sunday night			0
i only wish our leaders had done a better job of showing solidarity with the passion for the freedoms exemplified by the rally .			0

@entity220 : @entity41 leaders were *conspicuously* *absent* from historic @entity2 rally
the @entity16 are eager to see signs of @entity41 support after terrorist attacks
