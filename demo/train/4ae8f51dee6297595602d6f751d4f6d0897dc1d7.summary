-- @entity2 broadband users will soon face a cap on the amount of internet data they can download a month			1
traditional dsl users will be capped at 150 gb per month , while subscribers to the fiber - backed @entity9 system have a 250 - gb limit			1
usage over that will be charged at $ 10/month for 50 gb , the company says			2
the company says that currently only a small percentage of users -- around 2 % -- use this much data a month			1
if that 's the case , it 's not clear why the company is bothering to install the caps			0
it is , however , the same rationale ( and the same usage stat ) that the company relied upon to explain why it would be capping @entity26 data plans last summer , which had hitherto been " unlimited			2
" wired : congressman wants to ban download caps @entity29 and @entity9 connect fairly directly to a hub -- unlike cable connections where users share a local loop that can become congested			1
bulk - bandwidth costs for an @entity35 are a tiny portion of its business costs , and those prices continue to fall even as users consume more and more data			1
so , how could a user end up hitting these caps ? streaming video such as hd movies from @entity45 , using bittorrent to download movies and heavy gaming with services like @entity50 can easily eat up lots of data , especially in households with multiple heavy internet users			1
@entity2 is n't the first large broadband provider to impose caps			2
@entity57 imposed a 250 - gb cap shortly after the company was caught throttling bittorrent downloads			1
@entity61 tried going further with trials of a service that imposed very low limits for users , which led to a furor among users and lawmakers			0
there 's little data to demonstrate whether large @entity35 actually are experiencing real issues with congestion			0
skeptics see the limits as ways to discourage cable video customers from " cutting the cord " and getting their video online , or as a way to pocket profits instead of re-investing in bulking up their infrastructure			0
@entity84 , the research director for the net neutrality advocacy group @entity85 says the limits will discourage online innovation , and that with the growth curve of internet usage , the limits will soon catch many internet user			0
" when @entity35 force their customers to watch the meter , experimentation , innovation and business will suffer , " @entity84 said			0
" @entity2 's actions are another troubling symptom of a broadband market that lacks meaningful competition , and this move may be the start of a race to the bottom among other providers to see who can squeeze its customers the most			2
at worst , this is a plan designed to discourage cord - cutting and pad profits ; at best , this is another example of an antiquated phone - company business model being forced onto an otherwise vibrant and limitless marketplace			0
