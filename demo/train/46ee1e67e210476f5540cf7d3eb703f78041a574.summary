@entity0 -- @entity2 was many things to many people , but when i pause to consider his life , mostly i smile and think of his sense of humor , his dry wit and his remarkable ability to render someone speechless with a well - placed one - liner			1
he was not the kind of man to fall over in laughter or to guffaw loudly			0
he did not make silly gaffes , inappropriate innuendos or stupid jokes			0
instead , just like the rest of him , his humor was dignified , statesmanlike and perhaps a little old - fashioned			1
some of @entity2 's jokes were well - used and a bit cheesy , but that did not detract from their simplicity and effectiveness			1
he had a small arsenal of one - liners he used for different people			1
if he met a married couple , he demanded to know from the lady , " when did you propose to your husband ? " of course , for @entity2 , with his early 20th century , patriarchal value system , it was hugely amusing to imagine anything as audacious as a woman asking a man to marry her			1
and of course , his question was always met with nervous , unnaturally loud laughter that broke the ice			0
i am not sure whether his jests were merely a @entity2 social tic or a deliberate public strategy			2
either way , @entity2 won over foes , disarmed critics and charmed the media with his cutesy , gee - whiz humor			1
besides the jokes , he could also lather complete strangers with devastatingly flattering compliments			0
he often said to those whose lives are not distinguished by public office or marked by accolades , " i am so honored to meet you			0
" as a television reporter for the @entity61 , @entity63 's national broadcaster , and then later as a @entity1 correspondent , i watched him from the sidelines , time and time again , use humor to put people at ease			2
more often than not , he would poke fun at himself with classic comic timing			0
he would often start off a speech by thanking everyone for coming to listen to " such an old man			0
" later , after he stood down after one term as @entity63 president , i heard him win over a group of staid , white @entity63 businessmen by telling them , " nowadays , i am just a poor pensioner			0
maybe you could hire me ? " self - mockery was a typically savvy @entity2 ploy to ensure that people would relax around him			1
the cult of @entity2 had become so pronounced that celebrities , world leaders and ordinary people often became tongue - tied and gibbering when they met him			1
so , joking about his failings or mistakes was just another way of @entity2 saying : " @entity89 ! i 'm cool			2
" @entity2 walked with a ramrod gait , straight - backed and stiff			1
over the years , i watched many people meet him for the first time , and without exception , they came away from the encounter amazed at how tall and regal - looking he was			0
how a @entity97 pop - song helped free @entity2 only children seemed unintimidated by his height and fame			1
there is something about @entity2 that kids loved			1
i saw little children run to him without knowing why they were doing it and toddlers rustle around his legs like purring kittens			0
for them , and even us adults , perhaps he was like a smiling @entity63 @entity112 ? the feeling was mutual			0
@entity2 mined children for their opinions and views of the world			2
he seemed to relish their brutal honesty and innocent humor			0
one of @entity2 's favorite anecdotes -- often told in public -- was of a conversation he had with a 4 - year - old girl who asked him how old he was			1
@entity2 replied , " i ca n't remember , but i was born long , long ago			2
" she then asked him why he went to jail			0
@entity2 replied , " i did n't go there because i liked it			2
some people sent me there			0
" she asked how long he had been in jail			0
@entity2 again replied , " i ca n't remember , but it was a long , long time			2
" @entity2 then relays to his audience that after a thoughtful pause the little girl said , " you are a stupid old man , are n't you ? " @entity2 's good humor and jovial demeanor were not just a public ploy to charm crowds or disarm nervous guests			1
he used it to great effect in his political life			1
a familiar story in @entity63 is how , during multiparty negotiations before the 1994 democratic election , he would often gently tease the leader of a rightwing @entity150 party , gen. @entity151 , by saying , " we have to let the white man talk ; after all , he is from the supreme race			0
" again , a slightly naughty , cheeky grin would subsequently appear , by which time the chilly , racially charged atmosphere would have been warmed up by nervous laughter			0
for @entity2 , sports were a major weapon against racism @entity2 even amused the @entity97 royal family with his casual , overfamiliarity with the @entity164 , whom he called " @entity165 " and not " your majesty			1
" it was a deliberate snub against pomp and protocol for the simple , humble @entity2			2
" well , she calls me @entity2 , " was his repost , when one of his grandchildren asked if it was not perhaps in bad form to call the @entity164 by her first name			2
one only wonders the response from the @entity97 establishment when @entity2 complemented " @entity165 " on her figure ; " why , @entity165 , you 've lost weight ! " he reportedly said to the famously stiff - upper - lipped monarch			1
@entity2 's humor was centered in his inherent sense of self			1
he played the fool or jester sometimes , all the while knowing that he was fundamentally deeply content with himself			0
for me , it is a very powerful indicator of greatness			0
while some leaders flounder with self - doubt , or others primp with self - congratulations , @entity2 was merely a twinkle away from nudging you in the ribs with a self - knowing smile			1
@entity2 : man of many handshakes			2

@entity2 had an arsenal of one - liners , @entity205 writes
