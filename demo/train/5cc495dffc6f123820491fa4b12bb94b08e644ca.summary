-- the @entity1 voted tuesday to override the governor 's vetoes and pass two strong anti-abortion measures			2
one law requires women to undergo an ultrasound examination and listen to a description of what it shows before getting an abortion			1
@entity1 president @entity13 @entity12 , a @entity14 , said tuesday 's vote shows lawmakers listened to @entity1 's residents and " made a bold statement in support of the sanctity of life			1
" but @entity23 gov. @entity22 has called the legislation " an unconstitutional attempt by the @entity27 legislature to insert government into the private lives and decisions of its citizens			2
" @entity22 vetoed the bill and another abortion - related measure friday , but the @entity36 on monday overwhelmingly voted to override both vetoes , with house speaker @entity38 , a @entity14 , lauding his colleagues for moving quickly			1
the @entity1 's 36 - 12 vote tuesday was the final step required to make the bills laws " those who rallied behind this cause reflected the core values of @entity1 citizens , and i applaud my colleagues in providing more safeguards for the life of the unborn , " coffee said			1
@entity22 said he was disappointed by tuesday 's vote			0
" it signals the beginning of another costly and possibly futile legal battle for the state of @entity27			0
both laws will be challenged and , in all likelihood , overturned by the courts as unconstitutional , " he said			1
" i fear this entire exercise will ultimately be a waste of taxpayers ' time and money			0
" in a statement issued after his vetoes friday , @entity22 sharply criticized the laws			2
" state policymakers should never mandate that a citizen be forced to undergo any medical procedure against his or her will , especially when such a procedure could cause physical or mental trauma , " @entity22 said			0
" to do so amounts to an unconstitutional invasion of privacy			2
" @entity22 said one of the flaws of the ultrasound bill was that it lacked an exemption for rape and incest victims			2
@entity22 vetoed similar legislation in 2008			0
the @entity86 struck down the legislation because it contained multiple subjects , a violation of the state constitution requiring measures to deal with a single subject , @entity85 said			0
the @entity93 said it had filed a lawsuit challenging the new law after tuesday 's @entity1 vote			1
" @entity1 has now passed the most burdensome ultrasound law in the country , " @entity97 , the organization 's president , told @entity0			1
" until @entity1 stops harassing women who are seeking abortions , we will continue to sue the state on these unconstitutional restrictions			0
" coffee said challenging the new laws in court would go against what @entity27 residents want			1
" the voice of the people has spoken twice now this session in the @entity1 and twice in the @entity36 , and i sincerely hope those who would reverse the people 's voice would think twice before acting , " he said			1
the other measure approved by legislators tuesday prohibits pregnant women and their families from seeking legal damages if physicians " knowingly and negligently " withhold key information or provide inaccurate information about their pregnancies			1
@entity22 , in opposing the bill , said it would be " unconscionable to grant a physician legal protection to mislead or misinform a pregnant woman in an effort to impose his or her personal beliefs on his patient			0
" such an issue would be particularly relevant to fetuses with disabilities			0
" by prohibiting recovery of damages in wrongful birth and life malpractice actions , the legislation would allow unscrupulous , reckless or negligent physicians to knowingly withhold information or negligently provide inaccurate information to pregnant women without facing the potential of legal consequences , " the governor said			1
the @entity36 voted to override the veto of the ultrasound bill by an 81 to 14 vote , well above the three - fourths majority required			2
state rep. @entity154 , a @entity14 , said the bill " does nothing more than give women as much information as possible before they make the life - altering decision to have an abortion			1
" " i do n't want a single woman to go through the lifelong torture of having an abortion without having all the relevant information , " @entity162 said			1
the @entity36 voted 84 to 12 to override the veto over the legal damages prohibition			0
state rep. @entity169 , a @entity14 , said the bill " simply states that a doctor can not be sued based on the opinion after birth that a child would have been better off if he or she had been aborted			0
" " a bipartisan coalition of members supported this bill the first time , and i am pleased they did again today , " @entity169 said			0
@entity38 , the @entity36 speaker , said , " we must move to stop the degradation of human life seen in recent years and stand up for those who can not defend themselves			0
" @entity0 's @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			0
