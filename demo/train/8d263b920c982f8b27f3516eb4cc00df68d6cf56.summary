@entity0 , @entity1 -- on november 8 , 1965 , 48 @entity4 soldiers lost their lives during " @entity6 " after the 400 men of the @entity8 were ambushed by roughly 1,200 @entity10 fighters			0
i did not learn about this battle from a history book or teacher in school , but rather a popular country song -- " the 8th of november " by the duo @entity18 and @entity19			1
whenever someone asks me why i love country music , i think of songs like that one , and @entity24 's " if you 're reading this , " and the @entity28 ' " traveling soldier " -- each with lyrics that capture the toll war has taken on this nation 's soul			1
now , it would be disingenuous of me to pretend a black guy from @entity35 listening to country is the norm			2
it 's not , and i know it			2
but i 'm not trying to be something that i 'm not			0
my family is from rural @entity42 and i spent a lot of my childhood playing on the dirt roads south of @entity46			0
i have an uncle who has yet to recover from his time in @entity49			0
so i know full well the world many country artists sing about : the watering holes , eating fried chicken , going to church , @entity52 , war			1
when @entity57 sings , " these are my people " i think : " yes they are			0
" obsessions : crazy about country music so i am excited to see the crossover appeal of acts such as @entity63 and @entity64			1
i look forward to seeing wednesday 's @entity65			2
but i will also tell you i am disappointed that so few artists will sing about the one glaring aspect of life in the country that greatly defines how many @entity4 view the genre -- and that is race			1
scan the singles released over recent decades and it 's as if race does n't exist as an issue despite the @entity77 , the home of country music , being the backdrop for the beginning of the civil rights movement			1
how can so many songs , like " november , " be written with such great detail about events that happened 40 years ago , in a country thousands of miles away -- and yet we hear hardly a peep about the battles over race and rights that occurred at the same time on the industry 's doorstep ? about the battles and conversations that are happening around it still ? in 2009 , country starlet @entity96 won the album of the year grammy for her cd " @entity99			1
" it would be encouraging to see more of country 's songwriters embrace that word and be just that : fearless			1
stop telling an abbreviated , sanitized version of their world while there is video from a surveillance camera in @entity42 showing a black man being beaten and eventually run over by a group of white teens who set out looking to attack the first black person they saw			0
while a word like " plantation " is used to describe the voting practices of black @entity118 and " lynching " is tossed around regarding the media 's treatment of a black @entity121			2
i can understand the hesitation some white artists may have about approaching this subject			0
they 're fearful of saying something offensive and country radio hates controversy ( see @entity28 , @entity28 )			2
but the truth is that not talking about the unpleasant parts of life in the country do not make them go away			2
it just allows others to tell your story for you			2
i 've met some amazing people in the country music field : good folks without a racist bone in their body			1
but they have seen and heard and lived through some disturbing things			0
they , too , have a point of view , a story			2
i wish the music would tell it			0
not just for the sake of the artists , but for the millions of white @entity4 who come from small towns , listen to country music and should not be viewed as social pariahs by the rest of the nation because of it			1
acknowledging racism does not perpetuate it but rather exposes the disease where it festers and hides			0
and just as " the 8th of november " taught me something about the @entity165 , country music can remind people not to allow the stereotypical few to unfairly define the whole			1
in 2004 , @entity169 released his cd " when @entity173 , " which included a song called " @entity172			0
" it was never released as a single but the song caught the attention of the duo @entity179 , who later covered it			0
the song became a top 10 hit for them in 2006 , but not before they massaged the lyrics			0
instead of @entity169 's original : his old man was a rebel yeller , bad boy to the bone , and say ca n't trust a color feller , he judge ' em by the tone of their skin the duo sang " you ca n't trust that other feller , " softening the language a bit			1
i 'm sure it does n't seem like a big thing to some , but i know some still refer to blacks as " colored " or worse			0
so while i applaud the group for going as far as they did , i would have preferred they just told the story like it is , with all the warts , gashes , scabs and wounds			0
after all , racism is ugly			1
it 's ok to say so			0
it 's ok to sing so			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 .			1

@entity220 : country music taught me about war
he says it 's *strange* that country does n't tell the story of race and civil rights
@entity220 : country music should be like the title of @entity96 's cd : " @entity99 "
racism is ugly ; it 's ok to say it , and sing it , @entity220 says
