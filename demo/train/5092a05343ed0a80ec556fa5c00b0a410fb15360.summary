@entity0 -- she 's a top corporate executive , she leaves work every day at 5:30 p.m. so she can have dinner with her kids , and now @entity7 coo @entity6 is here to help working moms figure out how to follow her successful model			1
not surprisingly , @entity6 's effort to lead a new feminist movement among working professional mothers -- outlined in her new book " @entity14 : women , work , and the @entity17 to lead , " and her accompanying online campaign -- has triggered a debate : is a high - powered executive who earns more than $ 30 million a year the best person to advise other working moms on how to advance their careers ? @entity23 : excerpt from @entity6 's book @entity25 -- a university professor , author and married mother of three -- can trace a lot of similarities between her career and @entity6 's , without the multimillion dollar salary , of course			1

she said she believes the " dramatic and tragic " story of why she " had to stop moving up the academic ladder " speaks to the real world obstacles that working mothers face all the time			1
that 's something that @entity25 said @entity6 's good fortune and financial resources have allowed her to escape			1

she believes women can do that by taking charge of their careers , to " lean in " rather than " pull back " when facing obstacles , she wrote in her book , which will be released on monday			1
" women rarely make one big decision to leave the workforce			2
instead , they make a lot of small decisions along the way , " @entity6 wrote , according to a book excerpt on @entity23			1

" in her book , @entity6 outlined three things women can do to further their careers : do n't slow down their career before deciding to start a family , let go of unattainable goals , and make sure their colleagues are aware when women are held to different standards than men , particularly when women succeed			1
the book had n't even hit the shelves before everyone from every corner started weighing in ( check out @entity23 's full coverage here )			2
@entity6 's push to get women into the corner office and at the conference table fails to take into account that not everyone is " superhuman and rich , " as @entity179 , a @entity180 professor and former senior adviser to secretary of state @entity182 , wrote in @entity183 @entity25 said it a little more succinctly : @entity6 lives in a fantasy world			1
" we do n't live in a vacuum , " she said , " maybe @entity6 does , but not the rest of us			1
