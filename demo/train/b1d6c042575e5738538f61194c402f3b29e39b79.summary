@entity0 -- dr. @entity3 's delay in calling 911 for help as soon as he realized @entity5 was not breathing may have cost the pop icon his life , according to a cardiologist who testified wednesday in @entity3 's involuntary manslaughter trial			1
dr. @entity10 , a cardiologist called as an expert witness by the prosecution , listed @entity3 's failure to immediately call for paramedics as one of six examples of gross negligence that contributed to @entity5 's death			1
" if these deviations would not have happened , mr. @entity5 would be alive , " @entity10 testified			2
earlier wednesday , @entity3 's defense team dropped its theory that @entity5 may have orally ingested the surgical anesthetic propofol that the coroner says killed him			1
lawyers for @entity3 will instead focus on the theory that @entity5 used a syringe to inject the fatal overdose through a catheter on his left leg while @entity3 was away from his bedside			1
@entity3 's defense also contends that @entity5 swallowed eight tablets of lorazepam , a sedative , in a desperate search for sleep the day he died			1
@entity3 's deviations from medical standards of care include the doctor leaving his patient alone with propofol and lorazepam nearby , which could have led to @entity5 self - administering the fatal drugs , @entity10 testified			1
" it 's like leaving a baby that 's sleeping on your kitchen countertop , " @entity10 said			0
" there 's a very small chance the baby could fall over , or wake up and grab a knife or something			0
" the @entity57 coroner ruled that @entity5 's june 25 , 2009 , death was from " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with several sedatives , including lorazepam			1
prosecutors argue that @entity3 is criminally responsible for @entity5 's death because his use of propofol to treat the singer 's insomnia was grossly negligent and an extreme deviation from the standard of care required of physicians			1
@entity3 should be found guilty even if jurors accept the theory that @entity5 self - administered the fatal dose because the doctor was reckless for leaving the drugs near his patient when he was not around , @entity10 testified			1
the possibility that @entity5 drank propofol arose during @entity3 's preliminary hearing in january , when a prosecution expert agreed with the defense that a higher level of propofol in his stomach compared to his blood suggested it could have happened			1
both prosecution and defense experts conducted tests on animals since january 's preliminary hearing on the " bio-availability " of propofol if consumed orally			2
defense attorney @entity94 agreed wednesday that the studies showed " propofol , when orally ingested , is not bio-available			0
" another study , conducted over the summer on university students in @entity100 , concluded " if you drink propofol , it will have trivial effects on the person , " deputy district attorney @entity97 said			0
" @entity106 propofol did not kill @entity5 , " he said			2
the defense , in a rare moment in the trial , agreed			0
" we are not going to assert at any point in time that @entity5 orally ingested propofol , " @entity94 said			2
with about three days of defense testimony expected , closing arguments could be just a week away			0
@entity10 is the first of three experts who will wrap up the prosecution 's case			0
@entity10 said he based his conclusions on @entity3 's own words to detectives in an interview two days after @entity5 's death			1
that interview was played for jurors in the previous two days of the trial			0
@entity5 would be alive today if @entity3 had called 911 for help within two minutes of realizing @entity5 was not breathing , instead of waiting about 20 minutes before asking a security guard to call , @entity10 said			1
earlier testimony revealed @entity3 did ask @entity5 's chef to send a security guard upstairs to help him about five minutes after the time prosecutors suggest he realized there was a problem with @entity5			1
the chef , however , testified that she sent @entity5 's 12 - year - old son upstairs instead of security			2
@entity10 said the use of propofol to treat @entity5 's insomnia was another extreme deviation from standards that contributed to @entity5 's death			1
he later acknowledged a recent report from @entity146 that the anesthetic had been successfully used to treat chronic insomnia , but he suggested it needed more study to be accepted			0
sleep expert dr. @entity151 testified later wednesday that propofol has no therapeutic value in treating insomnia , and to use it is unethical and an extreme deviation from the standards of care			1
" it is beyond comprehension , " @entity151 said			0
" it is frankly disturbing , " @entity10 said he based his conclusions on his belief that @entity3 had connected @entity5 to an iv drip of propofol after he gave him an injection of propofol			2
that assumption , he said , was made because @entity3 told police he had used such a drip on most previous nights			0
when @entity94 challenged him to show where in @entity3 's police interview he said he used a drip the day @entity5 died , he eventually said " i will agree with you , it 's not completely clear			1
" @entity10 also said it was gross negligence that @entity3 was not prepared for an emergency , such as having a generator in case there was a power failure			1
a sleep expert and an anesthesiologist are expected to follow @entity10 on the witness stand wednesday and thursday			2
the pathologist who conducted the autopsy on @entity5 testified tuesday that while it was physically possible that @entity5 could have given himself the overdose that killed him , @entity3 is still guilty of causing his death because he gave him access to the dangerous drugs			2
dr. @entity194 said @entity3 's admission in a police interview that he used propofol to treat @entity5 's insomnia was a factor in his conclusion that it was a homicide , not an accidental death			1
he said @entity3 's use of propofol in @entity5 's home without proper monitoring and resuscitation equipment or a " precision dosing device " contributed to the singer 's propofol overdose and subsequent death			1
" essentially , the doctor would be estimating how much propofol he would be giving , " @entity194 testified			0
" i think it would be easy under those circumstances for the doctor to estimate wrong and give too much propofol			0
" @entity3 , in the interview played for the jury over the past two days of testimony , told detectives he gave @entity5 a series of three sedatives -- valium , lorazepam and midazolam -- over a 10 - hour period before finally giving in to @entity5 's plea for propofol			1
" i 've got to sleep , dr. @entity3 , " @entity3 said @entity5 pleaded to him			2
" i have these rehearsals to perform			0
i must be ready for the show in @entity231			0
tomorrow i will have to cancel my performance , because you know i can not function if i do n't get to sleep			0
" @entity3 said he injected a small dose of propofol using a syringe , but the prosecution contends he also used a makeshift iv setup to keep @entity5 medicated and asleep			1
that drip may have malfunctioned while the doctor was not monitoring his patient , they contend			0
the propofol bottle that prosecutors say @entity3 used for the iv drip had a slit in the rubber top , which @entity194 said is evidence it was part of the drip system			0
on the recording , @entity3 insisted he kept a close watch on @entity5 after he finally fell asleep			2
the physician never mentioned the long list of e-mails and calls that cell phone records later revealed			0
@entity194 testified it was unlikely that @entity5 self - administered the deadly dose of propofol in the two minutes @entity3 said he was away from him , but he conceded under defense questioning that it was physically possible			1
@entity5 could have reached the iv port near his left knee to self - inject propofol , he said			0
if @entity5 pushed the drug in quickly , it could have made his heart stop immediately , @entity194 said			0
@entity194 later added , under questioning by the prosecutor , that he would still consider it a homicide even if @entity5 administered the fatal overdose to himself since the doctor would have been negligent in leaving the drugs nearby			2
his testimony also gave some support to the defense theory that @entity5 orally ingested an overdose of lorazepam from a pill bottle next to his bed			0
a toxicology study of @entity5 's stomach contents , conducted in recent months , showed a level of lorazepam four times higher in the stomach that in his blood			2
" there would have to be some oral lorazepam taken somewhere along the line , " @entity194 testified , after taking a moment to do some quick math while on the witness stand			0
@entity3 was hired as @entity5 's personal physician while the singer prepared for his " @entity297 " comeback concerts in @entity299 , planned to start in july 2009			1
if convicted of involuntary manslaughter , @entity3 could spend four years in a @entity302 prison and lose his medical license .			0
