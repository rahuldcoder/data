-- when @entity2 was a young boy kicking a football around the dusty streets of @entity5 , he never dreamed he would one day carry the hopes of 170 million people on the world 's biggest sporting stage			1
" as a child , the @entity14 was something that was not for us but for others , " says the man who became one of @entity13 's pioneering football exports			1
" it was something like a mirage for my nation until my generation came around			0
" indeed , football was not even considered a respectable profession in the @entity2 household			1
" for my parents growing up , football was taboo and you could understand them because way back then , in @entity36 , nobody made a living out of playing football , " the 39 - year - old tells @entity0 's human to @entity30			1
" for my parents , there was no way you could play football because you 're going to grow up , become older and be unemployed , so you had to be schooled and i really thanked them because it 's made me get that education that has helped me to manage myself as an adult			1
" in the do - or - die world of football , if you 're not really educated and paper smart , you could sign contracts that will hurt you forever , so i thank them immensely			0
" @entity2 quickly won over his parents when he earned a contract at local club @entity52			1
now known as @entity54 , it has provided a stepping stone to bigger things for a long line of international players			0
" i remember coming home with my first wages and my father called my brothers and said , ' look , your brother is earning way , way more than i earned as an accountant for his first contract , ' " @entity2 recalls			1
" that 's when we were just like , ' wow , there 's something starting here			0
' " it was a journey that would take him far from home -- to clubs in @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , the @entity78			1
@entity2 , a defensive midfielder , would captain his country , win an @entity80 , and star at @entity82 in the @entity83 and @entity84			1
african nations had regularly appeared at the @entity14 since the 1970s , but @entity13 had to wait until 1994 for its first appearance			1
the scene was the @entity88 in @entity89 , and the opponent was a star - studded @entity92 team that would go on to reach the semifinals			0
" we were so nervous , " @entity2 says			1
" the men 's room was filled up before the game			0
" the talented @entity13 ( and their bladders ) need n't have been so concerned			1
oliseh and co. powered to an impressive 3 - 0 victory and topped the group despite losing to an @entity103 team captained by @entity104			0
" i got the opportunity to rub shoulders with the player whose poster was on my wall at the time , " @entity2 says			2
" he was the best player of our generation			0
that was when it dawned on me that i was ready for the big league			0
" the @entity13 lost to eventual runner - up @entity76 after extra time in the last 16 , but their swashbuckling style captured the imagination of fans around the world and set the tone for a golden age of @entity126 football			1
@entity127 came @entity129 success at @entity130 ' 96 , beating @entity103 3 - 2 in the final with a last - gasp winner			0
" my parents called me the next day and said , ' son , you owe us money ! ' and i said , " how come @entity138 and @entity139 ? " and they said , ' all the neighbors have been here drinking so when you come back , you have to pay us back ! ' " @entity13 went crazy			2
the president gave the whole country two days off			0
no work , we had to celebrate this -- so that shows you how much it meant to my nation and to @entity36			2
" for @entity2 , the @entity150 was even better as he scored one of the goals of the tournament in a 3 - 2 win against @entity155 , though @entity13 would lose heavily to @entity156 in round two			1
the goal was not only special for sending @entity13 into the knockout stage , but also because it was predicted by former teammate @entity160 -- a goalkeeper whose career was ended by a serious car crash			2
" all i could think about was , ' damn , @entity160 said this ! ' so he was the one i was running up to in the stands , to my brother to just share the moment with them , " @entity2 says			2
" and my nation was going through a dark period at the time			0
our president had just died , and this victory united our nation again			0
" these were halcyon sporting days that the football - mad country has yet to repeat			0
@entity2 helped @entity13 qualify for the 2002 @entity14 , but was not selected for the finals			1
as would happen again at the team 's next appearance -- at @entity36 's first @entity14 in 2010 -- @entity13 exited at the group stage			1
but now , @entity36 's most populous nation is daring to dream again			1
and the omens are strong			0
just like in 1994 , the @entity13 will go into the @entity14 finals as @entity36 champions , and in @entity183 they have been handed what is on paper a favorable draw after qualifying undefeated			1
once again they will face @entity103 , along with @entity187 and tournament debutant @entity188 in @entity190 but while the makings of a good team are there , @entity2 warns the present squad will have to go a long way to match the vintage sides of the mid- ' 90s			2
" the @entity14 group of 1994 , as far as i see it , was the most solid team @entity13 ever produced , " @entity2 says			1
" @entity198 in @entity13 during our generation hit the highest it could go			2
it became worldwide , it became a nation of footballers			0
" by comparison , today 's @entity126 stars have had a head start in making it in the game -- in many ways they are standing on the shoulders of giants			1
@entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 all earn big money plying their trade for @entity217 's elite teams , having been scouted and groomed from an early age			0
" my generation was blessed with this burden of being pioneers , " @entity2 says			2
" you did n't have anybody who had done it before that you could ask and say , ' look , what is it like ? ' " " when i went to the @entity76 league i was the first -- i had no other @entity126 to call up and say , ' how did you cope ? ' " no matter			1
with a confident and enthusiastic attitude to life , much like his playing style , the position of nomadic footballing trailblazer suited @entity2			2
he was one of the first @entity126 to play in @entity75 , spending four years at @entity235 before moving to @entity236 in @entity76 after the 1994 @entity14			1
a season in @entity238 was followed by a move to @entity240 in @entity77 then a sojourn in @entity78 with @entity242			2
while in the @entity245 capital @entity243 would endear himself to the @entity242 faithful with his dancing goal celebrations , picking up three trophies			0
@entity2 returned to @entity76 in 1999 for one season with @entity251 before moving back to @entity77 , this time with @entity252 -- winning the @entity254 title and a runner - up medal in the @entity256			1
each country provided different lessons in football and in life			0
" the moment i got to @entity76 , then i found out football was not a pleasure , it was business , " he says			2
@entity77 taught him discipline and was " where my way of living as a man was built			0
" playing for @entity251 , meanwhile , enabled @entity2 to live and play alongside legends of the modern game like @entity271 and @entity272 -- which he describes as " great for my own education as a person			1
" while there have been many @entity126 and thousands of @entity36 to follow in @entity2 's footsteps in the 20 years since he made the move to @entity217 , @entity36 national teams have not developed in the same rapid manner			1
@entity281 famously said an @entity36 nation would win the @entity14 before the year 2000 -- a prediction that has yet to be met			1
no @entity36 team has ever gone beyond the quarterfinals			2
@entity2 , who has set up coaching projects in @entity75 since retiring in 2006 , has strong opinions on why this is the case			2
" i think an @entity36 country will eventually win the @entity14			1
what is lacking now , it 's simple to say ... what is wrong is that we do n't plan well			0
we leave the planning ' til late , " he says			0
on the park , @entity2 also has a radical diagnosis for player development and tactics			2
" @entity36 need to learn how to start pressurizing the opponents			2
it 's no longer football where you pick individuals and expect them to do well , " he says			0
" now it 's more about team work , team dynamics , team schemes , things that are planned out			0
how to look at the opponent , how to bring about antidotes to the opponent 's playing star			0
" when it comes to physical strength and bursts of speed , you ca n't beat an @entity36			0
but what is lacking now is just that technical and tactical know - how			0
then we 'll get it			0
" @entity2 's @entity14 days may be long past , but come june and july he will be watching events in @entity183 with avid interest			1
" if i was to live without football now , i think i would die -- even my kids sometimes are bored because @entity138 is always watching games			0
