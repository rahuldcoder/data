-- @entity1 is revved up and ready to go ahead of his home @entity2 at @entity5 's @entity4 sunday			1
the 31 - year - old has not won on @entity8 soil since triumphing with @entity9 in 2006 but is in confident mood after taking 47 points from the opening four races of the season			1
and the @entity16 driver says the extra incentive of winning in front of his adoring supporters has given him an extra edge going into the first @entity23 race of the year			1
he told a press conference : " i think it motivates you to race at home and you give an extra 10 % on what you normally do , to take care of every detail of the weekend , starting from practice into qualifying and into the race			2
" you try to do everything well , because you know that a nice result here , a nice podium finish or whatever will make you happy , will make the team happy and make many people in the grandstand happy			0
" so , it 's a special weekend , but after all those years i think you 're ok with that extra motivation and it 's not any more pressure			0
" now you 've proved for many years that there 's not a pressure or anything that will stop you doing well			0
" if @entity16 are to succeed in seeing off @entity48 and @entity49 , then the team will need to avoid any trouble on the track -- a point not lost on @entity1			1
" i think that maybe it 's the first time we arrive with a competitive car , but that does n't mean you will fight for top places if you do n't do everything right and do n't put together a good weekend , " the double world champion added			1
" in the first four races we were competitive			0
we thought we could fight for the top places if the race was without problems			2
" we will try here to have a clean race with no problems and if that will be enough to put us in contention for the victory , it would be nice			0
" but if it 's not possible then we will try and be as high as possible			0
it is a weekend we approach with a positive mentality -- and not a defensive mentality like the first three years for me at @entity16			1
" one man who @entity1 will need to be wary of is triple world champion @entity77 , who currently sits 30 points clear of the @entity79			1
@entity77 , who won last time out in @entity80 , is expecting a difficult challenge with just ten points separating him from @entity49 ' @entity83			1
" it is much too early to make any predictions , " @entity77 said			1
" who would be so bold as to predict the outcome of a 19 - race championship after only four races ? " this weekend we have to concentrate on the modified tires and the work that we have to do before sunday to get our car right			2
" @entity83 , a two - time winner in @entity5 , finished second in @entity80 after coming home behind @entity77 's @entity48			1
and the @entity95 insists his team has much to do if they are to bridge the gap and claim a second victory of the season			2
" to catch the leaders , we have to work twice as hard as they are , " he told the @entity49 website			0
" it 's no secret that we want more speed from the car in qualifying ; it 's so tight up there at the front and we really need to be on the first two rows to fight for victories every time			2
" it 's good to be able to start the @entity23 season where we are as this is when you see teams starting to push on with lots of new parts for the cars			0
" it 's still early days , but to have scored strong points since the start of the year is obviously better than not having them			0
" we need to keep scoring points in the same way ; even if it 's a bad weekend for us , we need to keep finishing as well as we can			0
that 's how we will fight to the end of the season			0
