-- the majors have been and gone for another year , but golf has officially entered its most money - spinning phase of the season			1
as the 2013 campaign reaches its climax an eye - watering $ 67 million in prize money will be on offer in the four @entity11 playoff events			1
last year 's winner , @entity12 , picked up over $ 12.5 million for 16 days ' work at tournaments backed by heavyweight sponsors like @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
it reflects an industry battling back from recession , and one that is contributing more than you might think to help boost what is still a fragile economy in the @entity27 -- which has a public debt of almost $ 17 trillion and rising			1
the @entity31 's @entity30 report estimates that the industry generated $ 68.8 billion in goods and services in the @entity27 in 2011 , with a total economic impact of $ 176.8 billion			1
" the golf industry is larger than the spectator sports and performing arts industries combined , " @entity31 chief executive @entity35 told @entity0			1
" that 's pretty substantial compared to those two			0
beyond the monetary contribution it makes , it also employs close to two million @entity27 with a combined wage income of $ 55.6 billion			1
" what 's important about that is when people think about people employed in golf , they generally think about the @entity49 and @entity50 of this world			2
" that 's true , but they are at the higher end of the scale -- what people do n't tend to think about is a lot of the jobs in golf are everyday kind of jobs filled by people who are trying to slug out a living , and feed their family			2
" they 're working at restaurants , in the grill room , working on the course , taking bags out of your car , cleaning your clubs			0
believe me those people are not getting rich , but that is the real backbone of the golf industry			1
" golf is nothing if not resilient			2
the deep recession of 2008 in the @entity27 did not spare the sport , but in recent years it has come out swinging as it moves back towards the $ 75.9 billion the @entity31 estimates it generated in 2005			1
those figures surely wo n't be lost on one of golf 's biggest fans , who also happens to be the @entity83			2
@entity84 is an avid golfer -- he enjoyed a february round with the world no. 1 @entity49 in @entity87 and spent a good chunk of his recent vacation in @entity90 on the course			1
a report released by the @entity93 in april even suggested @entity84 has spent more hours on the golf course during his presidency than in economic meetings			1
counting the commander in chief as one of the game 's biggest and most influential supporters can only serve as a great advert for the game , according to @entity103			0
" there are a couple of things about the president that are really very positive , " he said			0
" one , he 's arguably the busiest man in the world with the toughest job in the world , but he can make time to play			0
he played five times on his recent vacation in @entity90			0
" that leads to the second point : the fact that he plays it by the rules , and he 's enthusiastic about it and tries to play whenever he can , speaks to the magic of the game			0
" it can be addicting in a good way and it clearly has been for the president			0
" as well as counting the most powerful man in @entity27 as a golf fan , the game has strengthened its presence on @entity129 in recent years			1
a series of events have been designed to trumpet the growing portion of the economy that golf supports to @entity136 's power brokers			1
" it 's important for us to communicate effectively in terms of the impact golf has on the economy generally and the kind of jobs it creates for everyday @entity27 , " @entity103 explains			1
" because when laws and regulations are being made , it 's important the golf industry is treated like any other industry of our size and scope			2
that relates to the second audience we 're trying to make sure understands the facts about golf , and that is the influencers of society generally			0
" however , not all politicians are in love with golf 's financial contribution -- a @entity165 senator is seeking to overturn the not - for - profit status enjoyed by the @entity167 and other sporting bodies such as the @entity169 and @entity170 which means they are exempt from federal taxes			2
@entity172 reported in may that of the $ 130 million the @entity167 gave to charity last year , most of it went to the @entity31 -- whose main purpose is to promote golf			1
" it 's important for golf to have a good reputation in the court of public opinion and not be viewed as a sport for the privileged few played on private clubs by the affluent few , " @entity103 said			0
" it 's not that game at all but it gets perceived sometimes to be that kind of sport			0
" that point of view might get temporarily sidelined while the game 's stars are in the thick of @entity11 action			0
but while the vast sums on offer might turn some of the public off , seeing golf 's top players battle it out with such huge prizes at stake is a surefire way to get viewers to turn on			2
more than 30 @entity167 tournaments this year offer a winner 's purse of greater than $ 1 million -- by contrast the @entity205 lost several events from its calendar this year due to the downturn			1
and the bigger the prize pot , the more money that drips down through the system , says @entity103			2
" i think it makes a very strong statement about the health and vitality of the golf industry when you have these world - class brands who want to associate with golf , " he added			1
" they 're willing to put up significant sums to be associated with those events , and the players have the opportunity to play for the kind of money reflects very favorably on golf			1
" i always say there are two economies in golf			0
there 's the participation economy which is about the everyday golf facilities , trying to attract golfers and current players to play as much they can			2
" then there 's the entertainment side of golf too and that 's where the professional tours come in			0
that relates to the interest of the game			0
" if we can enhance interest in the game that can lead later down the line to participation			0
we also know that interest in the game spawns what you 're seeing over the next few weeks			0
" when people come out to an event itself or tune in on tv , that 's why the @entity17 of this world affiliate with those events			0
" it certainly an indicator of the health of the industry for sure			0
