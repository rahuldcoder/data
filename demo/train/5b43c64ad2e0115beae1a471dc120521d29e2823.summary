there has never been any doubt that president @entity2 fully accepts the @entity4 's authority to render a definitive ruling on the constitutionality of the @entity7			1
chief executives during our history , including president @entity11 in the 1830s and president @entity13 in the 1940s , have in fact challenged or threatened to challenge the court 's right to command obedience to its understanding of the @entity20 , but @entity2 certainly is not among them			1
as a brilliant constitutional lawyer deeply devoted to the rule of law , he has nothing but respect for the critical function that judicial review performs in preserving the @entity28 system of constitutional government			1
efforts to divine a contrary theory in his remarks were strained at the outset and have grown only more untenable			2
the " unprecedented , extraordinary " step he noted the justices would be taking if they were to overturn the @entity7 was , of course , not the step of exercising judicial review , as the court has done ever since @entity41 in 1803 , but the step of second - guessing congressional judgments about how best to regulate a vast segment of the national economy			0
no one in the world -- certainly none of the justices -- can have been surprised to learn that @entity2 believes his signature domestic achievement fully complies with the @entity20 and ought to be upheld -- or that the @entity4 has a decades - old tradition of treading lightly when major regulations of interstate commerce come before it			1
after the president made that entirely clear tuesday , some suggested that it would be best for presidents not to comment on cases pending before the @entity4 even while the rest of the nation continues to debate the underlying constitutional issues			1
i was among those who took that view while others suggested that , as the entire nation continues to discuss the constitutionality of a vital economic measure , artificially muzzling the nation 's chief executive ill serves the purposes of open public debate on important issues			1
that 's something about which people can reasonably differ			0
but there 's no reasonable basis for seeing in the president 's comments either a challenge to the court 's authority as an independent branch of government or a clumsy attempt to pressure it politically or to influence its deliberations			1
this president knows as well as anyone how utterly implausible it would be to think that the justices might be swayed in their constitutional views by his brief remarks , which did little more than reiterate a core theme of the government 's legal briefs ( namely , the critical importance of strong judicial deference to the elected branches on complex matters of economic regulation like national health care policy )			1
this theme has received a full airing in media commentary , congressional hearings , legal scholarship and lower court judicial opinions			2
nobody could really believe that the president 's candid expression of a view that everyone already attributed to him would move the judicial calculus even a micrometer			1
the justices have spent months steeped in more than a hundred legal briefs , presided over one of the most dramatic oral arguments of the past century and are currently engaged in robust internal deliberations			0
they also live in a world awash with op - eds , heated commentary and all the markers of fiercely divided public opinion			0
these are men and women accustomed to dealing with politics			0
they ordinarily approach their duties with the utmost seriousness and , we must hope , are exercising their very highest faculties of judgecraft and constitutional commitment in this case			0
there was no disrespect in the president 's entirely correct observation that precedent and historical practice alike would lead a suitably cautious court to uphold rather than overturn his signature first - term achievement in providing health insurance to millions of @entity28			2
the fact that health care reform has represented a pressing issue for the nation over the course of a century would indeed make a decision to strike down the law all the more jarring			0
but the notion that the president 's recognition of that fact somehow crossed the @entity164 in our separation of powers by seeking to diminish the court 's independence is patently absurd			2
that said , we have recently witnessed a shocking misuse of power in relation to these events			0
but it came from the judiciary rather than the president			0
judge @entity178 of the @entity179 responded to the president 's comments by ordering the @entity182 to submit a three - page , single - spaced memo stating the administration 's position on judicial authority to invalidate unconstitutional laws			1
attorney general @entity188 filed that memo thursday , reiterating the plain import of the president 's remarks and stating that " the power of the courts to review the constitutionality of legislation is beyond dispute			1
" @entity178 's gratuitous order is little more than a thinly concealed insult to the president , the @entity182 and the administration			2
it constitutes a shocking departure from norms of judicial behavior			0
while such partisan bickering might be expected from the minority leader of the @entity208 or from commentators like @entity210 , who drew upon @entity2 's remarks in yet another entry in their relentless attacks on the president , it is hardly to be expected of a federal judge			1
as constitutional challenges to the @entity7 have journeyed through the courts since the statute 's 2010 passage , the country has engaged in a profound national conversation about the @entity20 's import and meaning			0
although i remain unpersuaded by constitutional objections to the statute , i respect the efforts of many @entity28 to give voice to their convictions in constitutional terms			0
this week 's distortion and exaggeration only tarnish the earnestness of such efforts and threaten to undermine the genuine opportunities for constitutional dialogue and disagreement that sustain us as a nation .			2
