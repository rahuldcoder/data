-- the @entity1 has issued a final decision to reclassify sunlamp products and ultraviolet or uv lamps used in indoor tanning salons			1
the federal agency has changed the labeling requirements from low - risk to moderate - risk devices			1
they are also requiring the products carry a black box , visible to consumers , that states the products should not be used on people under age 18			2
although a black box is the @entity1 's strongest warning , this does not outlaw or restrict these devices for minors			1
according to the @entity1 , the lamps emit uv radiation that may cause skin cancer			1
the @entity26 says studies have shown people who have been exposed to uv rays from indoor tanning have a 59 % increase of developing melanoma , the most dangerous form of skin cancer			2
" the @entity1 has taken an important step today to address the risk to public health from sunlamp products , " said dr. @entity34 , director of the @entity1 's @entity35			1
" repeated uv exposure from sunlamp products poses a risk of skin cancer for all users , but the highest risk for skin cancer is in young persons under the age of 18 and people with a family history of skin cancer			1
" representatives for the @entity50 , which represents indoor tanning manufacturers and distributors across the country , said they believe the @entity1 is responding to pressure from certain interest groups to put stronger regulations on indoor tanning beds			1
" i just do n't think the science is there , " said @entity57 , executive director of the association			0
" i think it 's blown out of proportion			0
we are obviously disappointed in the @entity1 's latest moves			1
" the association 's website promotes indoor tanning 's " well - known side effect " of exposing skin to uv light as producing more vitamin d , which " plays an important role in maintaining good health			1
" it suggests the " health benefits of indoor tanning deserve further research			0
" in 2009 , the @entity78 classified tanning beds as " carcinogenic to humans			0
" skin cancer experts say it is about time these changes be put into effect			0
" for years we have watched more and more people being diagnosed with melanoma , the deadliest form of skin cancer			0
today the @entity1 made a decision that may turn that trend around , " said @entity89 , executive director for the @entity90			1
" like the tobacco industry , tanning salons market an addictive product disproportionately to teenagers and young women , playing on common insecurities			0
" " the @entity1 's decision to more strictly regulate tanning beds will save lives and serve as a valuable resource in efforts to slow down the increasing rate of melanoma , particularly in the young			1
by classifying tanning beds as @entity110 devices , tanning salons will now be required to demonstrate they are properly maintaining their equipment , " he said			2
noting this is a good first step , other dermatologists said they hope the @entity1 will do more			1
dr. @entity115 , director of @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118 , said he sees far too many patients at the practice with skin cancer			0
many of them made tanning beds a regular habit			0
" those who use tanning beds on a regular basis , especially teens , have 10 times the risk of developing all three types of skin cancer , including melanoma , which is deadly , " @entity115 said			2
" my youngest melanoma patient was 18			0
she was using tanning beds since she was 13			0
she has a huge scar on her back and is constantly being monitored			0
i think there should be restrictions on these devices for those under the age of 18 , because teens do n't understand the consequences , especially when they use the beds frequently , " @entity115 said			2
" i feel the black box will help , but there needs to be more restrictions put into place			0
" even though there has been a push for the @entity1 to restrict people under 18 from using tanning beds , the @entity1 said that is not what the latest changes are about			1
" that is an action ( restricting teens from using tanning beds ) we are willing to consider , " said @entity156 , deputy director for policy at the @entity35 at the @entity1 , " but this is not what we are addressing today			2
" " restricting teens ' access to indoor tanning is critical to preventing skin cancer			0
as medical doctors who diagnose and treat skin cancer , dermatologists are committed to reducing its incidence and saving lives , " said dr. @entity167 , a board - certified dermatologist and president of the @entity169			2
" therefore , we will continue to communicate to the @entity1 the need for stricter regulations on the use and sale of indoor tanning devices for minors under the age of 18			1

@entity1 changes label requirements for sunlamps and uv lamps
the @entity1 reclassifies them as " moderate - risk devices " instead of " low - risk "
dermatologists call for even stronger regulations
