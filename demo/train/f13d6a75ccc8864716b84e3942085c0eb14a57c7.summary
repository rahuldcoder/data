-- @entity2 's @entity1 8.1 just got an upgrade with the voice of @entity5			1
if you 're an avid video game player , you 're probably thrilled			0
@entity5 is a character in the popular @entity9 video games series			1
she 's sexy and smart and tries to save the world			2
so how does @entity2 's @entity5 compare with @entity12 's @entity11 ? we 'll find out			1
but here 's the interesting question : why are @entity5 , @entity11 , and basically all " virtual assistants " female ? sure , there 's the biological factor , i.e. , our time in the womb predisposes us to prefer the sound of a woman 's voice			1
and then -- as @entity0 's @entity25 pointed out -- there 's also tradition			1
ever since @entity30 , automated navigation systems in airplanes have used female voices , which stand out in the male - dominated cockpit			0
and let 's not forget straight - up sexism , whose logic goes something like this : " well , if it 's an assistant , it has to be female , right ? " all of these reasons certainly contribute to the choice of a female voice for the increasingly popular " virtual assistant " feature on smartphones , which understands commands and in some cases talks back			1
but let 's not discount the influence of a certain @entity51 television program that has a hypnotic hold on western culture right now : " @entity54			1
" have you noticed that trendy clothes are tight - fitting right now ? and ties are skinny ? and fedoras are everywhere ? @entity61 , even @entity60 's sales are booming			0
it 's the @entity54 factor , and this phenomenon also makes everyone want a female assistant			1
but in 2014 , assistants are about as rare as those @entity68 typewriters from season 1 , so we 'll take the next best thing : the virtual version			2
most of us have to make our own coffee , hang up our own coat , and set our own appointments			0
but by golly , having @entity5 or @entity11 call someone for you makes you feel like a regular @entity79 , if just for a moment			1
@entity81 sure is a selfish rake , but would n't it be great if you had an assistant to do your shopping for you -- just like @entity81 ? with @entity11 and @entity5 , you at least have someone make your shopping list			1
of course , we draw the line at boss - secretary romance			0
let 's not get carried away			0
a person and a computer program ? no one would ever be weird enough to fantasize about falling in love with an operating system			0
unless you count the $ 481 million in ticket sales from " her , " a movie with this exact premise			0
but perhaps i have n't convinced you			0
for example , you might be wondering how there can be a distinction between the sexist reason for wanting a female assistant and the @entity54 reason			1
is n't it the same thing ? no. from fashion to furniture , everyone wants a little @entity54 in their life			2
and whatever form " a little @entity54 " takes , it must resemble the show as closely as possible			2
@entity117 creator @entity117 takes pride in the deadly accuracy of his period details , and so do we , when we recreate aspects of the show in our lives			0
if all the assistants on @entity54 were men , everyone would want a male virtual assistant right now			1
also , let 's not forget that everyone roots for the female characters @entity132 and @entity134 , both of whom begin the show as assistants			1
they both break through the glass ceiling ( in very different ways ) on their way to the top of the advertising hierarchy			0
we want them to succeed , and we agonize over the injustices heaped upon them in their ascent			0
whatever our gender , we also want female assistants , just like @entity132 and @entity134 eventually have when they become powerful			2
there 's a twist to this story			0
@entity5 , the artificially intelligent character from @entity9 , was based on the ancient @entity152 queen @entity151			2
some scholars believe @entity151 ruled @entity152 after the death of her husband , @entity155			0
viewed from this perspective , @entity5 represents not only a helpful , soothing voice , but also an eventual ruler			1
for those who are predicting world domination by robots , the choice of @entity5 is certainly something to ponder .			2

@entity2 's @entity1 8.1 just got an upgrade with the voice of @entity5
@entity168 : why are @entity5 , @entity11 , and basically all " virtual assistants " female ?
he says there 's biological factor , tradition , sexism , and the popularity of @entity54
@entity168 : having a virtual assistant like @entity5 makes us feel like @entity79
