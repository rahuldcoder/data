-- by t - minus 18 days until the @entity2 and , of course , we are all starting to place bets on who we think will walk away with little golden men this year			1
luckily , the @entity2 has proven itself to be pretty darn predictable over the years			2
if you 're @entity9 , you 'll probably win best actress			2
if you sing in a flick , you are almost guaranteed @entity2 gold			2
but there 's another trend we 've been noticing lately : the winners for @entity10 and @entity16 tend to be the person who 's taken on the based - on - a - true - story role			1
in fact , 10 of the 20 top honors given in the 2000s went to actors who portrayed real people			0
let 's take a look , shall we ? last year , @entity9 won best actress -- just days after taking home a @entity28 -- for playing @entity29 , the @entity30 mom who took in @entity31 and helped coach him toward football greatness			1
the real @entity29 was in the theater to see @entity9 accept her award			1
the @entity35 in 2008 , @entity36 won the @entity37 -- again ! -- for playing @entity38 , the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in @entity40			1
i still remember the gorgeous mermaid - scale gown that @entity43 won when she accepted the @entity10 in 2007 for her role in " @entity45			1
" in the movie , she played @entity47 , an extremely popular singer in @entity48 who was also known for her out - of - control social life			2
in many ways , @entity43 won for playing the @entity51 of 1950s @entity48			2
the @entity0 : 12 starlets married and divorced by 26 in 2006 's " @entity53 , " @entity52 managed to out - @entity54 herself in the movie about the aftermath of princess @entity58 's death			0
@entity52 , of course , won oscar gold for her efforts			0
@entity62 was one of two actors to portray writer @entity64 in a two - year span			0
his uncanny portrayal netted him a @entity37 win in 2005			0
the @entity0 : 10 @entity68 themselves doctors that same year , @entity70 won @entity10 for playing another beloved real character -- june @entity72 , the wife of @entity74			1
in the movie , @entity70 did n't sound exactly like june as she warbled " @entity76 , " but put her own spin on the classic tune			0
blame it on the al - al - al - alcohol , but sometimes i forget that @entity82 is an @entity2 winner			1
he won @entity16 in 2004 for his portrayal of iconic ivory - tickler @entity84 in " @entity84			0
" the @entity0 : scandalous 9 celebrity @entity85 together @entity87 broke out of the former - model mold when she played @entity89 , a prostitute who killed at least six men			0
by gaining 30 pounds , rocking a mullet , and perfecting an eyebrow-less , terrifying stare , @entity87 won @entity10 in 2003			1
@entity94 may be in beer ads now , but in 2003 he was riding high after winning the @entity2 for best actor in " the @entity97			0
" in the movie , he played @entity101 piano virtuoso @entity99 , who survived the @entity103 invasion of @entity104			0
in 2000 , @entity105 took on the role of a brash single mother who , without a law degree , helped construct a lawsuit against @entity110			1
she won an @entity2 for her real - life role in " @entity112			1
" the real @entity112 , however , did not get a statue for her cameo in the flick as a waitress who takes @entity105 's order			1
the @entity0 : 10 reasons why we need the " @entity120 " movie to happen so who will the real character effect benefit this year ? interestingly , none of the nominees for @entity10 played screen versions of actual people			2
but this will make for a very tight race for @entity16 , with @entity130 portraying @entity132 creator @entity131 in " @entity133 , " @entity134 playing a stuttering @entity135 in " @entity136 , " and @entity137 as @entity138 , a mountain climber who has to hack off his own arm in " 127 hours			0
" which of them do you think will win ? @entity142 all rights reserved			0

@entity9 won @entity10 for playing @entity29
