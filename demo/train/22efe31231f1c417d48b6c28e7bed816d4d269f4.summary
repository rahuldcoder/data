-- @entity2 's list of honors are modest compared to the achievements of @entity6 's top football clubs , but what the @entity8 side lacks in history is made up for in ambition			1
since being taken over by @entity12 in may 2011 , significant steps have been taken , on and off the pitch , to make sure @entity2 can challenge for major titles -- and new manager @entity15 is under no illusions about what is expected of him			2
" this club does not have a big history like @entity22 , like other clubs like @entity24 , like @entity25 , like @entity26 , " the 52 - year - old , who replaced @entity19 in december , told @entity0			1
" the aim is to reach that kind of level			0
" formed in 1970 as a merger between @entity31 and @entity2 , @entity2 's last @entity32 crown -- and only second overall -- came in 1994			2
can @entity35 cash make @entity2 a football force ? that was followed two years later by a @entity40 triumph but , added to a collection of domestic knockout competition trophies , the haul falls well short of what new @entity2 president @entity43 expects			1
@entity15 has won @entity6 's top club competition as both player and coach with @entity22 , and is well aware of @entity43 's vision for @entity2 and the need for him to deliver @entity51 football to the @entity53 next season			1
" his objective is very clear , " the former @entity55 manager said			0
" to build a good image of the club , to build one of the top clubs in @entity6			1
" he wants my experience , my knowledge to help the club and the team to improve quickly			0
he has a fantastic passion for football and he knows everything			0
" putting the pride back into @entity2 @entity2 's spending spree so far includes the signing of @entity74 playmaker @entity73 for a record @entity8 transfer fee			2
the club targeted superstar @entity77 and @entity74 forward @entity78 in december and january but both players ended up staying at their respective teams , @entity80 and @entity81			1
@entity22 striker @entity82 was another to turn down @entity2 's advances , but he and fellow @entity85 star @entity84 of @entity25 may yet move to @entity86 when the transfer window reopens in july			1
" in the summer i think the market will be more open , " @entity15 said			0
" we will have more possibilities as compared to january but i think all the players can come			0
" the club tried to reach an agreement with @entity77 but i was not here			2
i was not involved in this thing and i think they were very close ; @entity77 ( said he might ) come here but at the end decided to stay in @entity97 to play with @entity80			0
cash for cups ? @entity35 's influence " @entity78 was a different thing because @entity78 's first choice was @entity22 , but he had a problem with @entity22			1
the second choice was @entity2 but we did n't find an agreement economical with him and we were not able to buy for this reason			0
" @entity15 's appointment at @entity2 has also seen him reunited with @entity109 , who he managed in two separate spells at @entity22			1
@entity109 also spent time working above @entity15 at the @entity111 after being appointed @entity22 's technical director in 2008			1
" i have a good experience because he was my player in @entity22 and he was my boss in @entity22 at the same time			2
so i have a very good relationship , " the former @entity115 international said			0
" but i think that one of the reasons i am here is because @entity109 knows me very well and knows what kind of a job i can do , so i think when we met for the first time i think we were agreed on everything			0

@entity2 coach @entity15 says the club wants to rival @entity26 and @entity25
the @entity128 says the club 's @entity35 owners want to make @entity2 one of @entity6 's top clubs
@entity15 *confident* @entity2 can *recruit* top players after failing to land @entity77 and @entity78
former @entity22 coach glad to be reunited with his former player @entity109
