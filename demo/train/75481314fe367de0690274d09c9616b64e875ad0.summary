@entity0 , @entity1 -- the prosecution in the trial of @entity6 's manager - boyfriend @entity5 and two doctors portrayed the actress as an addict who had no control over her drugs in closing arguments that began monday			1
@entity14 deputy district attorney @entity13 used two @entity16 portraits to show jurors " what doctors should do , " while painting drs. @entity20 and @entity21 as physicians who fed @entity6 's addiction instead of treating her illnesses			1
doctors have a responsibility to protect patients " even from themselves , " @entity13 said			0
@entity5 and the doctors are accused of conspiring to feed the reality tv star and @entity33 model 's drug addiction and using false names to obtain the drugs			1
the defendants are not charged in @entity6 's february 2007 death , which a @entity39 medical examiner ruled was from an accidental overdose of a sleep aid , a lethal mix of prescription drugs and a viral flu			1
@entity46 judge @entity45 has been highly critical of the prosecution 's case , suggesting it was built from " a dead celebrity and a bunch of low - level misdemeanors			1
" @entity45 said he decided to allow the case to go forward after another respected judge advised him to trust the jury system			2
the judge has questioned whether the prosecution has proved that @entity6 was an addict , as defined by @entity1 law , and not just dependent on drugs to relieve chronic pain			1
" if she 's being treated for pain , it 's not illegal , " @entity45 said last week			0
@entity13 , the first of two prosecutors to deliver closing arguments , said that at some point during the last three years of @entity6 's life , @entity20 and @entity21 were no longer treating @entity6 's pain , " but were prescribing to treat her addiction			1
" " there is not a single physical test done on @entity6 during the time dr. @entity21 is treating her , " @entity13 said			2
@entity20 kept no medical records of her care for @entity6 , but simply used her " prescription pad power " to provide controlled drugs to her			2
both doctors crossed ethical lines by developing personal friendships with @entity6 , @entity13 told jurors			1
" a doctor ca n't be both a physician and a friend , " @entity13 said			0
he reminded jurors of photos shown earlier of @entity20 naked with @entity6 in a hot tub at her @entity89 home months before her death			2
" she is writing prescriptions to keep @entity6 euphoric , not to treat a medical condition , " the prosecutor said			2
he read entries from @entity21 's personal diary written after he and @entity6 attended a gay pride event			1
" i was making out with @entity6 , my patient , blurring the lines , " @entity21 's diary said			1
another diary entry was evidence @entity21 knew his prescriptions for @entity6 were illegal , @entity13 said			2
" i give her methadone , valium			0
can she ruin me ? " evidence that @entity6 was an addict dates back to 1996 , when she voluntarily entered the @entity106 , he argued			2
@entity21 should have recognized that @entity6 was an addict when she first came to his office in april 2004 and asked for one of the most powerful painkillers available , @entity13 said			2
" @entity6 liked @entity110 , " he said			0
" she asked for what she liked			0
" @entity21 gave her another prescription for @entity110 six weeks later when @entity6 complained of pain from two ribs broken in a may 27 , 2004 , @entity116 accident			0
" if she was on @entity110 at the time she cracked her ribs , certainly she should n't be on a @entity116 , " @entity13 said			0
@entity21 ordered no x-rays or tests and did not take time to call another doctor who treated her the day of the accident , he said			0
@entity6 got @entity110 from four different doctors that month , he said			1
a doctor who treated @entity6 at @entity125 in june 2006 testified that she concluded @entity6 was addicted to drugs , @entity13 told jurors			0
when dr. @entity128 asked @entity21 then if @entity6 had any addiction issues , @entity21 laughed and said there have been some issues , @entity13 said			1
closing arguments are expected to last through wednesday			0
two charges against @entity5 were thrown out by @entity45 , who questioned the evidence that @entity5 , a lawyer , knew it was illegal to get drugs in multiple names			0
" it has all the hallmarks of a kitchen sink prosecution , " @entity45 said last week			0
" it looks like the prosecution is throwing everything in with the hope that something will survive			0
" @entity45 hinted that if the defendants are found guilty , he would consider " possible selective prosecution issues " when sentencing them			0
during the two - month - long trial , prosecutors showed a 13 - minute video of @entity6 bathing with her infant daughter months before her death to support their argument that @entity6 's speech was slurred and her mind was groggy from drugs			1
jurors were not allowed to see the bizarre video , which shows @entity6 talking in a childlike manner during a birthday party for a 9 - year - old girl			1
the defense does not deny @entity6 took a lot of drugs , but it says the doctors were treating her for chronic pain that other doctors had also diagnosed			1
the prosecution 's case was hampered by several key witnesses recanting details of earlier statements , including a former nanny who said she never saw @entity5 injecting @entity6 with a needle			1
