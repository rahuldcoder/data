@entity3 struggled with her serve in the gusty conditions , delivering five double - faults as she needed to come back from 4 - 2 down in the second set			2
" i faced her many times in the juniors and she used to be a nightmare for me because she used to slice and drop shot on clay , " @entity3 said			2

" i had n't played her since then , but i knew her game really well			0
i do n't think she had time to do all of that today on grass			0
if i 'm hitting a hard shot , i do n't think she has time to create , which is something she really likes to do			0
that 's her game , hitting a lot of drop shots and slices and getting people kind of crazy			0
" @entity3 has now won all seven third - round matches she has played at @entity2 without dropping a set			1
she has a 3 - 0 career advantage over @entity73 , who had lost five matches in a row before the start of this tournament after reaching the fourth round at the @entity79 and also last september 's @entity80			1
" @entity3 is a great competitor and fights for every point			2
she obviously has a lot of confidence , coming off the @entity12 now , " said the 22 - year - old , who beat @entity85 teenager @entity84 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 1 - 6 6 - 2			2
" she hits it flat and hard and she 's a champion , winning so many grand slams			0
it 's nice to play her again -- i like challenges and i 'm looking forward to the big match again			0
" @entity10 , twice a semifinalist at @entity2 , moved into the fourth round when @entity21 opponent @entity96 had to retire due to breathing difficulties when trailing 6 - 3 4 - 3			1
" i heard her cough a couple of times and it did n't sound good			0
i saw after long rallies it took her a little while to recover , " the @entity101 said of the 12th seed , who beat her in 2010 on the way to the final			0
@entity34 , who reached the last eight at @entity12 and the semifinals at the @entity112 , defeated @entity85 28th seed @entity114 6 - 2 6 - 3 to achieve her best result on the hallowed grass turf			1
@entity118 third seed @entity117 also reached the last 16 as she ended the hopes of 20 - year - old @entity121 player @entity120 , cruising to a 6 - 0 6 - 2 win			0
@entity117 , a quarterfinalist in 2008 and 2009 , will next face 20 - year - old @entity125 qualifier @entity126 -- making only her second grand slam appearance after a first - round loss last year			0
@entity129 , ranked 145th , followed up her upset of 16th - seeded compatriot @entity131 in the opening round to oust @entity21 no. 20 @entity133 6 - 3 7 - 6 ( 8 - 6 )			2
@entity135 30th seed @entity134 eliminated the conqueror of @entity80 champion @entity137 , winning 6 - 1 6 - 2 against 21 - year - old @entity139 player @entity138 to match last year 's effort of reaching the fourth round			1
@entity134 will next play @entity142 following the @entity21 17th seed 's 6 - 3 6 - 1 crushing of @entity146 's @entity145 -- who shocked @entity12 champion @entity148 in the second round .			1
