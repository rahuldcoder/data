one thing guaranteed to get the electorate talking ahead of any vote is a steady stream of cringe - inducing moments , and on that front @entity8 's federal election campaign has n't disappointed			1
@entity9 , the man who looks set to become the country 's next prime minister , won international headlines for all the wrong reasons with his misguided reference to suppositories			1
but he 's not the only one leaving voters squirming in their seats			2
here are our top 10 moments of the @entity8 campaign trail , in no particular order			1
@entity9 : vote for me because my daughters are hot okay , he did n't actually say that but that 's what @entity25 leader @entity9 implied when he and current prime minister @entity27 appeared on @entity8 's version of reality hit " @entity30			1
" ( yes , @entity30 still airs there and presumably has enough of an audience to convince both politicians that it was worth a shot at the youth vote			2
) while @entity27 reduced more than one housemate to tears with talk of love and gay marriage , @entity9 shot from the hip with a comment ( presumably aimed at the nation 's blokes given his views on gay marriage ) : " if you want to know who to vote for , i 'm the guy with the not bad looking daughters			1
" as commentator @entity58 noted : " adrift uneasily in the @entity51 between daggy and plain weird , @entity9 looked strangely like @entity52 from the era when the late @entity55 singer surrounded himself with @entity57 beauties , because			1
" ( for the uninitiated , " daggy " means uncool , unfashionable , etc. ) read more : could political brawler be next pm ? 2			2
getting hot and sweaty they may not have been " @entity57 beauties , " but when @entity9 found himself surrounded by a high school netball team it seemed he could n't help himself			1
" a little body contact " never hurt anyone , he told them after the girls apologized for being sweaty and crushing his suit during a photo call , according to national broadcaster the @entity75			2
it followed some effusive but what many considered inappropriate praise for a @entity81 candidate 's " sex appeal			1
" the cack - handed " compliment " was aimed at @entity82 , who days later offered a comment of her own crowned by the country 's immigration minister as " the silliest of the campaign			1
asylum seekers ? clogging up traffic anyone with half an eye on the @entity8 election will have noticed a lot of debate and angst about what to do about asylum seekers who arrive in the country 's waters by boat			1
when prompted to talk about the " hot topic " of asylum seekers , @entity101 said , " yes it 's a hot topic here because our traffic is overcrowded			2
how much fun is the @entity108 in peak hour ? it 's not fun , at all			2
" the @entity108 connects the inner - west with the outer suburbs of @entity113			1
@entity101 's comment prompted a stream of tweets , including one which asked whether jams were caused by " all those refugees towing their boats down the motorway			2
" after the furor , @entity101 claimed her quotes had been taken out of context			1
things that make you go ' ummmm ' while we 're on asylum seekers and @entity81 candidates , @entity129 deserves a mention			2
when asked about the party 's six - point plan to " stop the boats , " the election candidate failed to name the other five			1
in the days following , it seemed to become a sport for @entity8 journalists to track @entity129 down and pitch the question to him again to see whether he 'd managed to commit them to memory			0
however , he was nowhere to be found			0
in a six - minute video attached to an article headlined " where are @entity9 's wallies ? " reporter @entity147 tried to find him			1
after two days of phone calls and attempted doorstops she only managed to locate his mother			0
a new one for the map @entity129 may be hard to find , but at least he 's hanging in there for the vote , unlike @entity158 who withdrew her candidacy after making a series of jaw - dropping comments , all within one interview			1
" i do n't oppose @entity154 as a country , but i do feel that their laws should not be welcome here in @entity8 , " @entity164 told @entity165			0
she went on to confuse " haram " with the @entity169 and said @entity170 followed @entity171			0
a candidate for the fringe @entity158 , 27 - year - old @entity164 quit just 48 hours into her campaign			1
in a statement to the @entity75 , party leader @entity175 said she 'd withdrawn " following the disgraceful way she has been portrayed by recent media [ and ] ridicule over a minor gaffe			1
while @entity164 quit of her own accord , the ruling @entity184 made sure candidate @entity186 made it nowhere near the polling booths			1
he was dumped after admitting to verbally abusing a disabled female councilor in 2002			0
" i was a young mayor and i got angry one night and i spoke to her in angry way , which i acknowledged then and i acknowledge now , " @entity186 told local media			0
another nudged out of the race was @entity196 candidate @entity195 who called @entity9 " racist " and " a very , very bigoted person			1
" it came days after @entity27 called for a " positive campaign			1
' be careful of @entity200 ' allegations of racism were n't the only ones flying around			0
mining magnate @entity204 , perhaps better known outside @entity8 for his ambitious plans to build a replica titanic , shocked morning viewers by making some stunning accusations on live tv			1
" @entity212 's wife @entity211 is a @entity213 spy , " @entity52 said			0
" she 's been spying on @entity200 for years , giving money back to @entity213 intelligence			0
" " @entity204 , have you lost the plot ? " asked the visibly shocked presenter			0
@entity52 is standing for a @entity220 seat as leader of his own party , the @entity222			2
polls show the party could possibly win one seat			0
' @entity226 ' it must be hard to entertain oneself while hiding from authorities in a foreign embassy for months on end			0
that 's the only reason we can think why @entity235 founder @entity234 thought it was a good idea to don a fake mullet and sing his own version of @entity239 's classic @entity8 hit " you 're the voice			2
" ( for those unfamiliar with the terminology , " mullet " refers to a type of hairstyle , not the fish )			0
@entity234 is attempting to win an @entity8 @entity220 seat for his @entity249 , despite the surprise resignation of his running mate @entity251 -- who quit due to a lack of transparency and accountability , of all things			2
it 's not clear whether @entity234 will be able to take up his seat if he wins			0
it is clear that singing will not be a viable career option			0
slipper recycles another candidate relying on blasts from the past is former federal speaker @entity266 , who has defended his use of old campaign signs in his bid for re-election			1
it 's clear from the posters that they do n't feature a recent image			0
they 're black and white			0
oh , and @entity262 is now running as an independent candidate , so he 's had to cut off any @entity81 logos			2
the former speaker could be forgiven for wanting to avoid any more cameras			0
he was hauled over the coals and through the courts after being accused of sexually harassing a male colleague			0
a federal court judge eventually threw out the case last december , saying that he 'd come to the conclusion the claims were made to cause @entity262 " significant , public , reputational and political damage			0
will it end after the election ? probably not ... it seems appropriate to end this list with @entity292 , as the likely next prime minister and the country 's most prolific provider of head - slapping gaffes			1
@entity9 has n't won yet , but if he does then writer @entity297 has imagined the contents of his election speech			1
it starts with " my drear men and women of @entity8			0
i stand here tonight , on this maleficent evening , as your prime minister , to spank you very much and say how bumbled i have been to receive your thrust			0
" to read the whole " screech , " click here .			0

five - week election campaign filled with colorful quotes , *unfortunate* gaffes
potential leader @entity9 takes the prize for most prolific *contributor*
classic quotes also come from the candidate described as having " sex appeal "
others have quit after making poorly - received comments , others are lying low
