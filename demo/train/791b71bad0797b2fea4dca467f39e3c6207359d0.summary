days after he fatally shot an unarmed black teen in august , officer @entity0 was cutting grass when he was told his home address was circulating online			1
within three hours , he 'd grabbed some bags and gone into hiding , according to his attorneys			0
" he had to leave the grass , literally , half mowed , " his lawyer , @entity7 , told @entity9 's @entity8 late wednesday			1
since then , he 's stayed under the radar by moving from house to house , including briefly living with one of his lawyers , and spending time watching movies in dark theaters to avoid detection			1
@entity0 says he 's sorry but his conscience is clear ' not a question of if ... but when ' his lawyers revealed details about his time in hiding to @entity9 and the @entity28 newspaper wednesday			1
they told @entity9 that @entity0 is in talks to leave the @entity30 and may give up being an officer altogether -- after a grand jury decided not to indict him in the death of @entity34			1
" it 's not a question of if , it 's a question of when , " @entity7 said about his leaving the @entity38			1
@entity7 confirmed what @entity9 originally reported last week			0
his time in hiding @entity0 's shooting of the teen sparked days of sometimes violent protests in the @entity44 suburb of @entity45			1
as a result , the officer 's address was shared online , forcing him to flee his home , his attorneys said			1
" there were death threats out against him , " @entity7 said			0
" there were bounties that had been placed upon his life			0
" his client , he said , resorted to various measures to hide his identity			0
" he 's had to learn to live in a way that makes him completely unnoticeable			1
as a consequence , there are several techniques that he utilizes that make that happen , " @entity7 said without elaborating			0
" it 's an odd way to live your life			1
but for him , it 's all about his family			1
" except for his getting married last month , @entity7 told the @entity28 on wednesday that @entity0 mostly stayed out of the public eye			1
@entity0 preferred going to the movies because it was dark , @entity7 told the paper , jokingly saying that the officer " cross-dressed a lot			1
" keeping him safe was the first priority , he said			0
future uncertain immediately after the shooting , @entity0 maintained that he wanted to return to his job as a police officer , his lawyers said			1
but his officer days may be behind him			1
" realistically , he ca n't go back to being a police officer , " @entity7 said			1
there 's no illusion about any of this			2
but it 's the way in which he leaves ... that 's important to him on different levels			2
" " we want to make sure when he does , it 's amicable , " he told @entity9			2
" he 's on paid leave , and there are discussions that are going on right now to separate from the department in an amicable fashion			2
" another attorney told @entity98 that @entity0 's safety had a lot to do with his decision to leave			1
" i think i expressed to him , ' do you realize your first call ( back on the job ) will be to a blind alley where you 're executed ? ' he took a pause for a minute , thought about it and said , ' oh			0
' that is the reality , " his attorney , @entity110 , told the paper			2
@entity0 , 28 , spent six years with the @entity30 before being placed on leave after the shooting on august 9			1
before his stint in @entity45 , he worked for two years at another police department			2
last week , @entity9 reported that @entity0 told associates he would resign to help ease pressure and protect his fellow officers			1
@entity0 had expressed concern about resigning while the grand jury was hearing evidence for fear it would appear he was admitting fault			1
his many interviews @entity0 has said he killed the 18 - year - old out of fear for his life during their encounter			1
he maintains he did nothing wrong and was forced to shoot @entity34 after the teen attacked him and tried to take his gun			0
" i just felt the immense power that he had			0
and then the way i 've described it is , it was like a 5 - year - old holding onto @entity139 , " @entity0 told @entity136 on tuesday			1
" that 's just how big this man was			2
he was very large , very powerful man			0
" his lawyers said his story has remained the same throughout			0
" i met @entity0 approximately one hour after the incident , " his attorney , @entity144 , told @entity9			1
" that statement has been consistent one hour after the shooting , the following interview with the @entity150 detective and on august 10 when it was recorded at the @entity152			0
" @entity7 said the officer went through a series of interviews			2
" before he testified before the grand jury , he was also interviewed by the @entity157 and the @entity158			0
they came in and gave him an exceedingly rigorous interview , where they did n't leave any question unasked , " he said			2
called a ' murderer ' @entity34 's father , @entity34 , did n't mince words when he spoke about the officer			1
he described him as a " murderer " during an interview with @entity9			0
" he understood his actions			0
he understood exactly what he was doing			0
you know , he did n't have a second thought , a pushback thought , or nothing			0
he was intending to kill someone			0
that 's how i look at it , " the elder @entity34 said			2
" he was going to kill someone at that point			0
" next steps @entity0 's legal fights may not be over			1
there 's a federal investigation under way			2
" so we have a civil rights charge potentially down the road , " @entity144 told @entity9			0
" however , that 's going to be very difficult to prove , because on a civil rights violation , you must prove that he intended to violate an individual 's rights , and in this case , his life			2
civil suit ... we 'll have to wait and see			0
" but his legal issues are the least of @entity0 's worries			1
" he still has to deal with so many other issues because of all this , " @entity7 said			0
' sorry for your loss ' though he has not said much , @entity0 sympathizes with @entity34 's family , his lawyers said			1
" his remorse and his sadness about what happened is there , and it 's real , " @entity7 told @entity9			2
" but in respect to the @entity211 , he 's been very careful to sort of stand back			2
he knows that whatever he says , it 's not going to be read as he means it			0
he thought it 's better to say , ' i 'm sorry for your loss			0
' it 's simple , but it 's direct			0
and if you knew him , you 'd understand that 's the kind of guy he is			0
