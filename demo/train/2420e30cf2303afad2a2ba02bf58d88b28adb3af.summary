thousands flocked to @entity4 's @entity8 tuesday , praying , singing , and chanting as the 20 skulls were returned to their homeland			1
the skulls , which were transported in caskets draped with the @entity4 flag , were removed from the plane with military honors			2
among those welcoming the skulls was the country 's prime minister @entity18 who said , " these mortal remains are testimony to the horrors of colonialism and @entity3 cruelty against our people			2
may the mortal remains of our ancestors proceed into their homeland , " @entity4 media reported			2
according to historians , the skulls were taken during the bloody 1904 -1908 colonial conflict in former @entity3 @entity34 - @entity33 , when the @entity36 tribe rebelled against @entity3 colonial forces			1
it 's estimated that thousands were killed in the uprising			0
once in @entity42 , the skulls were used in research in an attempt to prove the supposed racial supremacy of @entity47 whites			1
the skulls were rediscovered at @entity42 's @entity49 in 2005 and are believed to belong to @entity4 's @entity50 and @entity36 ethnic peoples			2
they consist of 15 males , including a three - year - old boy and four females , said @entity49 spokeswoman @entity56			0
a delegation of over 50 @entity4 traveled last week to @entity42 for a handover ceremony before the skulls were repatriated to @entity4			2
members of the delegation read a prayer outside the hospital before the ceremony			0
the skulls have reignited old political tensions between the two countries			0
the @entity4 government has , for a number of years , demanded @entity3 acknowledge the war as genocide , calling for an apology as well as reparations			1
the @entity3 government , which gives development aid to @entity4 has refused to pay reparations			1
it has , however , expressed regret for the incident			0
a statement issued by @entity3 deputy foreign minister , @entity81 last month read , " we @entity3 acknowledge and accept this heavy legacy and the ensuing moral and historical responsibility to @entity4			1
" the @entity3 government is fulfilling this duty through particularly close bilateral cooperation - and development cooperation - with @entity4 , " it continued			1
@entity81 added , " i would also like to express my own personal deep regret and shame for what was done to the ancestors of the tribal representatives now in @entity42			0
" for his part , the ceo of @entity49 , professor @entity94 , apologized to the @entity4 delegation present at the ceremony in @entity42 for the role played by @entity3 scientists			1
" with this step we face up to an inglorious chapter of @entity3 history , " he said			0
" as a medical doctor and scientist myself , it is especially painful for me to realize that even physicians worked in the service of this early form of racism			0
" @entity111 said historians now agree that much of the research undertaken by these early scientists was a precursor to @entity117 ideology and is now universally acknowledged as a " perverse " science			1
despite years of research little is known about how the 20 people died , said @entity111			0
" their cause of death could not be determined			0
three skulls showed signs of lack of nutrition , but there was no sign of a violent death , " she said			0
but , she stated , this did not rule out the possibility the skulls belonged to victims of the conflict , with many thousands of people dying of starvation and exhaustion in camps set up by @entity3 colonial forces .			2
