who says you need a printer to churn out digital - quality images ? the @entity5 , a project from graphic design duo @entity7 , is recreating this modern effect with decidedly old - school techniques			1
@entity11 and @entity12 use fine tip markers and endless patience to mimic the layered tonality of @entity17 color printing , which uses cyan , magenta , yellow and black to create the full spectrum			1
( you may recognize these colors from your old printer cartridges			1
) however , the handmade component gives each print its own look and feel			2
" with something handmade , you create unique experiences or unique art works , whereas digitally , you can produce it over and over again , and it 's exactly the same , " says @entity12			2
how it 's made recreating an image seems both incredibly simple and frustratingly specific			2
using a half - tone version of a digital image as their guide ( imagine a picture broken down into tiny grayscale circles ) , the designers create four layers of tiny pen dots that correspond with the @entity17 process colors			1
if done correctly , the dots should create the illusion of seamlessly blended colors and defined shapes			0
" it 's like what you see on a billboard : if you were to look really closely , you would see all of the individual dots , " @entity11 explains			0
" the process is really very simple , just take care not to make lots of errors ... anyone could do it			0
" the amount of time needed to complete an image largely depends on the subject 's complexity and the size of the dots ( smaller dots create a more convincing optical illusion and take more time ) , but on average , it takes one person eight to 10 hours to fill a letter size sheet			1
fusing the human and the digital @entity11 and @entity12 first started the @entity5 in 2009 while studying at @entity76 in @entity77			1
as graphic design students , they often discussed human interaction with technology , and how the handmade relates to the digitally produced			1
" you print an image for a digital print and it always has the same finish to it			1
something that 's handmade is much more unique , it 's much more individual , " @entity11 says			0
" these ideas married themselves together and we were like ' hey ! what would happen if you were to do ( digital printing ) by hand ? ' " their peers ' enthusiasm compelled them to extend the project beyond graduation , and @entity11 and @entity12 eventually absorbed it into their current design practice			1
( they currently operate out of @entity77 and @entity101			0
) the future of prints while they do accept commissions like a traditional printing service and have recently started selling prints online , @entity11 and @entity12 try to reposition their work in more creative ways			2
in september , they were invited to create their largest and most ambitious work yet at @entity113 fair in @entity114			0
for four days , visitors watched @entity11 , @entity12 and a rotating team of five volunteers work in a glass cabin , dotting out a landscape on one of its 140 square foot walls			0
they 've also released two books exploring human intervention in digital processes			1
though they have n't confirmed what they 'll try next , @entity126 is happy to muse on the possibilities			0
" could we print in on another material ? could we explore the same process in a @entity133 printer ? " she says			2
" we 're just trying to expand the way we see it			0
" replacing traditional printing , however , will never be the goal			0
the hours required to make a print by hand are wildly impractical in the face of today 's instant printers , and no matter how much effort is made , it 's impossible to get a true duplicate with markers			1
in fact , the @entity5 put this to the test last year by hand - printing the same image 20 times in a row			1
the prints were not identical , but they were inimitable			2
" that 's the nature of why it 's called the @entity5 , " says @entity11			0
" it 's about celebrating things that are handmade and do have errors , compared to those that are digitally produced			0
" is this the end of ambitious @entity162 architecture ? explicit nude drawings that shook the world @entity165 unveils @entity101 ' latest landmark the lost art of the @entity169 pin - up			0

the human printer recreates digital prints by hand using fine tip markers
@entity7 , the design duo behind the project , mimics cmyk color processes
the project is meant to *highlight* the relationship between humans and technology
making a letter size image this way could take up to 10 hours
