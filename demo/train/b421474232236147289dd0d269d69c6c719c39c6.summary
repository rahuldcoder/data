-- the @entity1 is back -- but do you know who the rising stars of this year 's competition are likely to be ? @entity0 asked one of @entity8 's leading scouting experts , @entity9 , to give us his top five young players to watch out for in this season 's competition			1
but did @entity9 get it right ? you can tweet him here with your own picks			1
@entity17 " @entity19 's attacking midfielder @entity17 , who made his full international debut @entity21 at the age of 16,is currently playing for the @entity26 club 's b side but is expected to make his way into the first team this season			1
@entity30 " @entity30 is a 20 - year - old attacking midfielder who plays for @entity31			1
a supremely talented @entity35 - born @entity34 international , the free - kick specialist is already starring for his new club following his € 14.5 million move in july			1
" @entity38 " next up is @entity38 , he 's just 17 and is a central midfield player for @entity40			2
the teenage sensation became the club 's youngest goal scorer when he got @entity40 's first goal in the opening round of the @entity47 championship			2
he 's an intelligent midfielder with wonderful vision and passing ability			0
@entity50 " @entity50 is an attacking midfielder who plays for @entity51 and he 's just 18			0
he was snapped up by the @entity53 champions after failing to agree a new deal with @entity55			0
quick , agile with excellent technique , his mesmerizing runs from midfield are a headache for any defense			0
@entity61 " @entity62 's @entity61 , a 20 - year - old forward , is equipped with great physique , brilliant ability on the ball and a wide range of skills			1
he can play on either wing or as a floating forward and is expected to break into the @entity70 national team any time soon			2
" who will come out on top ? so those are the five youngsters to watch out for -- but which team will end up lifting the trophy on june 6 in @entity76 ? we asked our @entity0 sports team which team they fancied to triumph this season and here 's what they think			1
@entity84 : " football is a simple game , " former @entity86 international @entity85 once said			0
" twenty - two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end , the @entity35 always win			2
" which is why @entity93 will be crowned @entity1 winners			1
" coach @entity95 has had a year to instil his philosophy and @entity93 have arguably the strongest squad -- and by strongest i mean the best balanced -- in the competition			0
the addition of @entity102 's experience and guile could prove a masterstroke			0
@entity110 : " already boasting the attacking talents of @entity106 and @entity107 , @entity19 added the lethal @entity108 to an already potent strike force			0
with three of the best goalscorers on the planet , supported by the likes of @entity114 and @entity115 , @entity19 have enough firepower to shoot down any opposition			0
" @entity118 : " @entity119 is the final piece in the @entity122 jigsaw and @entity123 boasts a squad strong enough to go all the way this time around			0
the addition of @entity119 has breathed new life into @entity122 with the striker having scored seven times in his first four league appearances			0
the 2012 champion will see anything but a place in the last four as a failure and given its impressive start to the season , it would take a brave person to bet against @entity123 's men			2
" @entity139 : " they 're not the best team defensively but you could have said the same thing about last season 's @entity144 side -- and it was still good enough to claim " @entity147 , " a 10th @entity1			1
with @entity149 and @entity150 added to the squad , it can become the first club to retain their @entity1 title simply by outscoring the opposition			1
" that 's what our team has to say , but what do you think ? you can tweet us at @ @entity160 or leave us a message on our @entity163 page here .			2
