-- @entity2 critic and @entity4 opposition politician @entity3 has been convicted of misappropriating $ 500,000 worth of state - owned timber			1
a court freed him from detention on july 19 , pending an appeal of the court 's ruling against him			1
@entity3 has been campaigning for the @entity13 mayoralty -- officially registering as a candidate the day before his conviction -- and there have been allegations his trial has been politically - motivated			1
@entity4 authorities insist that is not the case			1
@entity22 : " i 'll win @entity13 , " says @entity3 who is @entity3 ? @entity3 is a corruption fighting lawyer who famously branded the ruling @entity28 party -- founded by president @entity29 -- " the party of crooks and thieves			1
" he has been a prominent organizer of street protests and has attacked corruption in @entity4 government , using his blog and social media			2
in a 2011 article entitled " @entity4 rising : the @entity42 's @entity41 , " @entity40 's @entity39 said before 2010 @entity3 had been known " only to a fairly small online community			1
" but in november 2010 , @entity39 said , @entity3 " blew the whistle " on what he said was a $ 4 billion embezzlement scheme at the state - run oil pipeline operator @entity47 -- a claim vigorously denied by the head of the company and @entity4 president @entity29			1
in january 2011 , @entity47 's boss branded the claims inaccurate , according to @entity56 news agency			1
and in september that year , state - run news agency @entity57 quoted president @entity29 as saying no crimes had been committed by @entity47			0
" the leaked documents he presented as evidence , which he posted on his blog , caused a sensation in the @entity4 and international press , and @entity3 soon became known as @entity4 's top crusader against corruption , " wrote @entity40 's @entity39			1
opinion : putin a hypocrite on @entity70 , @entity3 in 2012 , time included @entity3 on its list of " @entity74 's @entity73 people			1
" @entity4 chess legend and opposition activist @entity75 wrote the entry on @entity3 -- then 35 -- saying he was -- " at the vanguard " of data dissidents			1
how much of a threat does he pose to @entity29 / @entity2 ? @entity0 's @entity13 correspondent @entity81 said @entity3 's passion , charisma , fierce language and commitment to fighting corruption inspired many to join him in protesting on the streets			1
@entity88 , a political analyst at the @entity90 think - tank , said during the 2011 and 2012 protests over alleged fraud in @entity4 's parliamentary and presidential elections @entity3 was " by far the most popular figure			1
" " @entity3 quite bravely took on some of the very influential people in @entity4 , " she said			1
@entity88 said @entity3 was a fearless and very talented public politician who had managed to " beat the system that @entity29 built " to keep outsiders out of the political framework			1
@entity3 presented " a serious political challenge as a result of his unique personality and his amazing energy , " she said			2
" he was able , as a result , to build a following			0
" " he 's become a popular figure but he can not be described as the leader of the opposition , " she said			2
" he is the most prominent civic figure			0
" what are the details of his case ? a court in the city of @entity115 on july 18 found navalny guilty of misappropriating about $ 500,000 in a lumber deal when he was an adviser to the @entity118 's governor			1
it sentenced him to five years in prison			0
was the verdict expected ? the day before his trial began in april this year , @entity3 told @entity0 's @entity81 he knew he would be convicted and that it was likely he would be jailed			1
" i 've been investigating corruption in state - run companies by government officials for the last six years			0
i 'm making it harder for them to steal and they understand my anti-corruption work is a threat			0
" asked if he believed he had any chance of winning the case he replied : " of course not			0
they did n't fabricate this case to allow that and it 's obvious for me it 's going to be a guilty verdict			2
" why would he be jailed unless he was guilty ? the court found @entity3 guilty but his lawyers are appealing the verdict			1
@entity4 law forbids convicted criminals running for political office			1
talking to @entity81 before the trial began , @entity3 said : " it 's true one of @entity29 's goals in this trial is to stop me from being involved in politics but this law only exists in @entity29 's system and our goal is to destroy @entity29 's system			1
" @entity88 said she also believed the verdict was politically motivated			1
" the government is using law enforcement and judiciary machines to lock up a man who is a political challenge			0
there is hardly any doubt that the verdict in the courtroom was not made by the judge himself , " she said			0
" there is every reason to suggest that the verdict announced on july 18 in @entity115 was a decision made somewhere very high in the @entity2 executive			2
" @entity4 authorities have always insisted @entity3 's prosecution is not political			1
but a senior investigator recently admitted his colleagues had fast tracked their work in @entity3 's case because of his criticism of @entity4 's political system			1
" the suspect is doing his best to draw attention to himself ; one could even say he is teasing the authorities , " said @entity181 , the spokesman of @entity4 's @entity182 , in april , according to the @entity183			1
" so interest in his past grew and the process of bringing him out in the open naturally sped up			0
" president @entity29 's spokesman , @entity189 , told @entity0 that @entity29 had not followed @entity3 's trial			1
so then why has he been released ? when @entity3 arrived in court the day after his conviction , he found the prosecutor who had argued he should be sent to prison arguing instead for his release pending appeal , so that he could continue campaigning for the @entity13 mayoralty			1
@entity3 quipped that the court needed to establish the identity of the prosecutor because he may have been replaced by a double			1
@entity88 described @entity3 's release as an " amazing twist			1
" she said that his release was unlikely to have been as a result of protest action after the verdict was announced			0
the protest had n't been nationwide and involved just a few thousand people , she said			0
" it was not enough to force the authorities to retreat			2
also , the prosecutors ' request that he be released ... was filed even before there was a big crowd in the streets			0
it 's really hard to believe			0
" it could be the result of some sort of intrigue -- rivalries , tensions at the very top of the @entity4 political elite			2
" but she said any political involvement would be denied by the government			0
" their response , invariably , is , it 's up to the court to decide , " she said			2
" of course they would never admit how they interfere			0
" @entity57 reported that the trial judge " repeatedly rejected claims over his partiality and denied several motions to have him replaced			2
" will the conviction affect his bid to become mayor of @entity13 ? @entity88 said that if @entity3 's conviction was upheld by a higher court , his name would be unable to appear on an electoral ballot			1
however , she said he could campaign in the meantime			0
" after his release yesterday he can continue running			0
the idea is that now he is at large up until his lawyers send in an appeal in a higher court re-examine his case			2
he remains at large and his verdict is not effective , " she said			0
she said there was " good reason to predict " that the high court would uphold the verdict before the end of the campaign for the september 8 election			0
" he is still on a hook			0
in a theory , this higher court could make a ruling even earlier and effectively terminate his campaign			2
" speaking to reporters outside court after he was released , @entity3 said he would return to @entity13 to discuss his next steps with his staff , @entity57 said			2
" regarding my participation in the elections , i am not some kind of a kitten or a puppy to whom they first say it ca n't participate in the elections and then they say , ' let 's release him for a while so he can participate in the elections , ' " he said			0
once in @entity13 , he will decide whether to boycott the election or continue his campaign , he said , according to the news agency			0
" we 'll discuss it with the staff and with the volunteers			0
for now , i will stay a candidate , i am not retreating			0
" how has @entity3 's conviction been received in @entity4 ? @entity88 said @entity3 's conviction was not likely to cost @entity29 any support			1
" i do n't think it will affect his standing in the eyes of the conservative majority			0
the status quo is suspicious of any troublemaker , " she said			0
" the minority of more modernized urban @entity4 -- people who resent the government for being lawless -- people likely to sympathise with @entity3 -- i think they will be even angrier			1
" the rift between them and the government will become even broader , but we are talking about a minority			0
" what about the rest of the world ? the day @entity3 was convicted , the @entity316 's top diplomat , @entity315 , called the trial a sham			1
and former @entity320 leader @entity319 issued a statement saying the case " unfortunately confirms that we do not have an independent judiciary			0
" @entity325 , deputy director of @entity329 's @entity327 and @entity328 division , said she was not surprised by the guilty verdict but was shocked by the five - year prison sentence			0
" @entity3 's prosecution is meant to silence a leader and messenger , " she said			2
@entity336 's @entity327 and @entity328 program director , @entity335 , said , " this was a parody of a prosecution and a parody of a trial			2
the case was twice closed for lack of evidence of a crime , before being reopened on the personal instruction of @entity4 's top investigator			2
" but @entity88 pointed out the world had also expressed outrage over @entity4 's crackdown on protesters in 2011 and 2012			2
" i do n't think it has an effect			0
not on previous occasions and not this time			0
