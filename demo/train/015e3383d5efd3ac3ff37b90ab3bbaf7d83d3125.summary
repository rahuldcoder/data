@entity0 -- it was one of those behind - the - scenes moments that a reporter covering the @entity5 rarely gets to witness			2
about 1:35 a.m. thursday , a man ran up to a @entity8 bus , approaching from the left , waving his arms and shouting something that none of us on the bus could understand			1
i was sitting in the " sidekick seat , " a leather perch near the driver with a clear view			2
the three - bus caravan had just rolled into @entity0 , hours ahead of the final rally of the " just vote them out " tour -- the movement 's third national event since coming together a little over a year ago			1
the bus i was on carried about 14 weary travelers : @entity5 leaders and activists , journalists and @entity31 the dog , a small girl with floppy ears belonging to @entity8 chairman @entity35			1
we had just arrived after a grueling trip from @entity38 , @entity39 , where @entity40 rallied a crowd of thousands on @entity42 , and were blocks away from our destination			1
the bus was hard to miss , wrapped full - on in a @entity5 advertisement			1
apparently , just the sight of it made the man angry			1
as he rushed us , shouting all the way , the bus driver cautiously slid open his window			1
" this country is at war , " the man screamed into the slightly opened window			1
the driver quickly slammed it shut			0
no one on the bus , including me , could understand what point the man was trying to make			1
the activists dismissed him as a drunk			0
but one thing was very clear : the @entity5 had once again attracted attention from one of its many critics			0
in fact , the @entity5 movement has earned plenty of detractors as it has traveled cross-country labeling president @entity72 a " socialist " and blasting what it says is big government run amok , while invoking the @entity78 's sanctity			1
agitators have thrown eggs at the buses			0
@entity82 , one of the drivers , told me that a semi-truck driver tried to run his bus off the road			1
now there was a late - night ranting as the conservative activists rolled into the nation 's reliably liberal capital			1
on the drive to @entity0 , the activists had aimed their ire at cable news channels , news sites or blogs they felt were biased against the @entity5 movement			0
they praised outlets they felt cast the movement in its right light			0
from what i saw , the bus ' tv system was tuned to one news outlet in particular			1
@entity106 : it was n't @entity1			1
as for creature comforts , space was a commodity			0
seating was at a premium			0
virtually every seat was spoken for			0
four bunk beds were loaded with stuff			0
one guy slept on the floor next to one of them , in the middle of the narrow walkway that attached the front of the bus to the back			1
everyone stepped over him to get by			0
work spaces were virtually nonexistent , with laptops and @entity128 competing for space with kitsch and curling irons			0
hanging over the toilet in the cramped bathroom was a sign with a stern warning : " liquids only			0
" every once in awhile , a refrigerator would fly open -- spilling items out			0
still , despite the long trip , tempers never flared and pleasant conversation was not hard to find			1
the activists seemed to get along with each other and were accommodating to journalists			0
i mostly sat in the front of the bus			1
but i also spent time in the back , working out of a cramped space with the other journalists embedded for the trip			2
crammed into a @entity154 area with a small desk slab , we all did our work : i wrote stories , an editor and reporter team from @entity161 - based @entity160 did on - camera reports and a @entity165 reporter did live spots			0
he scripted a line about @entity167 " partying like it was 1773 " in one of them , a reference to the year of the original @entity171			0
we all laughed at that one			0
in the front of the bus , @entity31 was lounging comfortably			2
the pooch sat on one of the leather bench sofas along the window for most of the trip			2
it was a nice spot , considering that our @entity38 to @entity0 trip , expected to take about 7 hours , actually took more than 10 hours			2
multiple bathroom breaks and food stops had prolonged the trip			2
at one point , as i was interviewing @entity35 , he mentioned @entity31 , put a laptop in front of her , and said she likes to blog from the bus .			2
