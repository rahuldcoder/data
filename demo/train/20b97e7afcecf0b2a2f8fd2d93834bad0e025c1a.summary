imagine flying over @entity1 and seeing one of the fat - pixeled images from the gallery above			1
it would be hard not to smile , right ? i mean , what is that alien thing ? an oversized kaleidoscope ? a rip in the @entity10 ? some kind of freakish , town - sized cauliflower ? when @entity14 , a 38 - year - old artist and photographer , came across these " blurred " images of @entity1 landscapes on @entity18 , he was similarly perplexed and amused			1
" well , i laughed , " he said of the initial discovery			2
the hidden zones are " not only bases , they 're also royal palaces and fuel depots and ammunition depots and that sort of thing , " @entity20 told me			2
the @entity1 government " used a pretty spectacular method for hiding these locations , which does everything but hide them , basically			1
" @entity20 , who lives in the @entity34 , decided to turn this strangely beautiful form of censorship into art. his series of high - resolution @entity18 renderings is called " @entity1 landscapes			1
" created in 2011 , the series has been on display at @entity45 's @entity44 and elsewhere			1
next month , he said , it will be on display at the @entity49 in @entity50			2
each of the pieces in the series , he told me , is actually a composite of about 60 smaller @entity18 images			1
@entity20 stitched them together to create a print large enough to be displayed in a gallery			2
gallery curators have told @entity20 that this work reminds them of the @entity61 movement of the early 1900s , in which painters like @entity63 and @entity64 simplified reality into a collection of angular shapes			2
@entity20 told me he 'd never thought of it that way -- and that he suspects all the @entity1 government did to create this effect was use the " crystallize " filter in @entity73			1
" it could have been the friday of the month when the parents ( at the @entity76 ) were allowed to bring their kids to work , " he said			2
social media follow @ @entity79 on @entity80 to join the conversation about photography			2
the images are " very , kind of , childlike in a way			2
" they also hit at something deeper			2
" it 's a paradox : so much is visible " in the modern world , where security cameras and smartphones are everywhere , he told me			0
" and yet , so much effort goes into making things not visible			1
the @entity1 landscapes reflect that really brilliantly			1
they 're the effort to conceal something when it 's visible			1
" and that 's what i love about this work -- and this method of censorship			0
and it 's almost whimsical			0
like the country is letting its citizens in on the joke -- acknowledging , for once , that it is obscuring reality for security purposes			0
a spokesman for the @entity76 , @entity113 , told me that these artful obfuscations are no longer required under @entity1 law , and that , following a 2013 law change , " @entity18 will show military or royal locations without restrictions			1
" there is at least one remaining exception			0
that imagery likely has n't been updated since the law changed , @entity113 said			0
@entity18 does not play a role in the censorship , according to a company spokeswoman			1
" the imagery in @entity129 and @entity18 comes from a variety of sources , " the company said in an e-mail			1
" local aerial photography collected by imagery providers are subject to local law , and in some countries , as a condition for overflight , they require aerial photography companies to blur military installations and other areas deemed sensitive by the government			1
this is implemented by the local companies prior to delivery to third - parties like @entity18			1
" perhaps it 's already antiquated , but i still find the easy - to - spot censorship from the @entity1 landscape series refreshing at a time when so many government efforts at information manipulation and obfuscation are scarily covert			1
in the book " the @entity159 's @entity158 , " @entity155 argues authoritarian ( or would - be authoritarian ) governments are getting increasingly sophisticated and clever			0
instead of the outright manipulation and control shown by @entity164 , for example , many world leaders try to manipulate without being noticed , or while maintaining plausible deniability			0
" take , for example , @entity166 , " @entity155 wrote			0
" even as @entity167 became increasingly authoritarian , he never did violence to the @entity166 constitution ; he worked in the seams of @entity166 's political system , centralizing power through channels that could at least appear to be democratic			0
" internet censorship in @entity175 is another good example			0
the country 's @entity177 is used to filter local internet searches of provocative terms like " @entity181 , " the site of a 1989 pro-democracy demonstration			0
but there 's no big - bold - polygon equivalent shown to @entity187 users when the @entity188 is being censored			0
when people search @entity18 for banned terms , for example , " the user will see a blank page or a browser error message , " according to the site @entity196 , which tracks internet censorship in @entity175			1
was that censorship ? or a bad connection ? it 's clear but kind of is n't , exactly			0
the @entity201 is guilty of this , too			0
i 'd almost rather the @entity203 sent me a daily e-mail with a list of all of the information they 're collecting on me			0
they could do it in emoticons or whatever cutesy , pseudo-artful way they wanted			0
at least i 'd know what was happening			0
" a new kind of iron fist has arrived , tucked behind an acid - whitened smile , " @entity215 writes in a review of @entity155 's book for the @entity218			0
the @entity1 way -- beautifully obvious censorship -- is clearly preferable , if unrealistic			1
few governments seem willing to fess up to their efforts to censor and manipulate			2
if they all took the artful @entity1 approach to it , their citizens might be more likely to trust them			1
at least they 'd know what 's going on , and could form rational arguments in support or opposition			0
as it is now , many government programs -- especially those that involve spying and censorship -- are largely invisible and , therefore , entirely suspect			2
@entity14 is a @entity239 photographer			1
you can follow him on @entity80 and @entity242 .			0

@entity244 talks with artist @entity14 about his " @entity246 " series
the series *focuses* on an artful effort by the @entity1 government to censor @entity18
