-- @entity2 's ruling communist party unleashed a blistering attack wednesday on dissident artist @entity4 -- and on the @entity5 for criticizing his apparent arrest			1
@entity4 has not been seen since sunday , when he and an assistant said on @entity8 that they had been taken into custody en route to @entity11			2
@entity2 broke its silence wednesday with a pair of articles in a @entity1 newspaper			1
one @entity17 piece said he had been " detained by police , according to overseas media reports			2
" the other article , an editorial , said @entity4 " has been close to the red line of @entity2 law ... as long as @entity4 continuously marches forward , he will inevitably touch the red line one day			1
" " he will pay a price for his special choice , which is the same in any society , " said the editorial , which called him " an activist , " and " a maverick			1
" @entity4 , one of the country 's best - known artists , helped design the iconic @entity35 for the @entity36 , but later called for a boycott of the 2008 games because he said @entity2 was using them as propaganda			1
the artist has also accused the @entity2 government of trying to silence dissidents			2
the @entity17 editorial wednesday blasted " @entity5 governments and human rights institutions " for calling for his release			1
it accused them of " reckless collision against @entity2 's basic political framework and ignorance of @entity2 's judicial sovereignty to exaggerate a specific case , " and failing to find out " the truth			2
" " the @entity5 's behavior aims at disrupting the attention of @entity2 society and attempts to modify the value system of the @entity2 people , " the @entity17 said			1
the @entity2 - language version of the article is harsher , saying criticism from the @entity5 is the reason @entity2 people " loathe " it			1
@entity4 's name has apparently been censored on @entity2 online forums , but people are getting around the ban by using nicknames and puns , or by using his father 's and wife 's names in posts			1
some also refer to him as a baker of sunflower seeds , a reference to his installation at @entity82 's @entity81 of 100 million painted pottery sunflower seeds			0
police surrounded his studio sunday after authorities reportedly detained him at a @entity88 airport			0
" they crack down on everybody who has different opinions -- not even different opinions , just different attitudes , " he told @entity0 last year			0
" simply to have different opinions can cost ( dissidents ) their life ; they can be put in jail , can be silenced and can disappear			0
" in the past , @entity4 has noted that he has paid a price for his own dissent			2
in january , the artist said authorities placed him under house arrest to stop him from attending an event he planned after officials announced that his new studio would be demolished			0
" just recently i heard the new studio i built in @entity106 will be demolished , all because of my activities , " @entity4 said at the time			0
" so what is my activity ? my activity is very simple , asking basic rights for people to freely express themselves and also to find a new structure , a new way of communicating			0
because i 'm an artist and this is what i do and i believe in that			0
" in the past several weeks , @entity2 authorities have detained and arrested a number of lawyers and human rights activists amid calls for anti-government protests similar to those that have swept the @entity124			0
@entity0 's @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 contributed to this report .			0
