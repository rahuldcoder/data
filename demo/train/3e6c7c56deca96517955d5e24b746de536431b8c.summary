" when the sirens sounded , 15 trained defenders would go to the roof			0
the anti-aircraft gun mounted there was used once , when the @entity5 was bombed in may 1972			0
the planes came over the @entity7 , and the shooters on that roof also shot at the plane			0
i do n't know if they found their mark			0
" @entity15 's memories of the @entity16 were brought vividly to mind with the recent opening of @entity20 's old air raid shelter			1
lost for decades , then rediscovered and now open to the public , the claustrophobic tunnels are a unique memorial to wartime @entity24 -- one to the bonds formed during a time of fear and destruction , and to the role this iconic hotel has played over the last 111 years			1
@entity15 , who was a member of the @entity30 , @entity31 , says the metropole was the only hotel in the city to have a shelter			1
he was responsible for taking care of government guests from 1969 until 1972 , all of whom were hosted at the hotel , then known as @entity41 ( @entity42 )			1
" i was really happy when i found out that they had found the bunker and [ general manager ] @entity47 's idea was to bring it back , " he says			1
" it 's important for the hotel , important for the city and important for the country			1
" @entity52 : @entity54 - 9 spacecraft boosts tourism in @entity57 's space city in the months that followed its rediscovery , the shelter has been cleaned out and made safe for exploration			1
@entity63 relic made amenable it has a new entrance -- shiny new concrete steps more aligned with the luxurious trappings above than the darkness below -- but otherwise , the shelter is pretty much as it was found			2
the bare , low - ceilinged rooms are dark , damp and musty			0
water drips from air ventilation shafts			2
old wiring curls out of rusted circuit breakers			0
@entity74 light bulbs -- @entity15 remembers them being purchased -- are still screwed into their sockets			0
and former @entity81 second secretary and consul @entity82 's graffiti is still discernible on the wall : " @entity84 , aug. 17 , 1975			2
" @entity85 does n't remember tagging the wall , but does recall fishing around the waterlogged shelter , then being used for storage , for documents and the odd elusive bottle of @entity81 wine during his two - year residency at the hotel			1
@entity52 : @entity97 's 50 best beaches @entity85 was one of the first to tour the shelter on the @entity100 's new @entity99 , which explains the hotel 's history over the last century and more			1
the shelter was built sometime during the mid- 1960s , and although the hotel staff has always known of its existence -- general manager @entity105 says that at least one guest a week has enquired about it during his four - year tenure at the hotel -- the shelter was unearthed by chance during the renovation of the hotel 's @entity112 less than a year ago			1
@entity105 says he felt a keen sense of responsibility to reopen the shelter as a tribute to the @entity100 's war - era staff			1
" bombs were falling on @entity119 and people were still coming to work -- nobody could guarantee a bomb would n't fall on the hotel -- there were no laser - guided missiles then , " he says			1
when the decision was made to renovate the @entity112 , @entity105 decided to do some digging of his own			0
an adventure " eventually we drilled into the space above the stairs , " says @entity105			0
" we created a cavity around 70 centimeters deep and were on our chests , looking around , and we could see there was a structure there			0
it was like an @entity140 adventure			0
" in august 2011 , @entity105 and his chief engineer finally broke through more than two meters of earth and reinforced concrete and the shelter 's 278 - millimeter - thick ceiling to emerge into a 40 - square - meter space , divided into five interconnecting rooms by heavy metals doors			1
it took a full week of pumping before the water level was brought down to 20 centimeters , and @entity105 , wearing boots , shorts and an old t - shirt , could splash down to explore			0
the shelter provided a unique glimpse into the hotel 's incarnation as a government - run wartime guesthouse -- a world away from the opulence of its @entity163 colonial heyday			1
after being constructed by two @entity163 investors in 1901 , the @entity100 had quickly become one of @entity168 's most celebrated hotels			1
in 1923 , @entity169 checked in with the sole purpose of finishing " @entity171 in the @entity172			0
" @entity173 spent his honeymoon in the hotel after marrying @entity176 in @entity177 in 1936			1
in 1951 @entity178 stayed for the first time , while writing " @entity182 " and acting as a correspondent for @entity181			0
but during the war , well - heeled travelers sipping coffee and fine cognac on the @entity100 terrace were replaced by scared @entity24 ducking into bomb shelters sunk into the pavement as the @entity190 flew overhead			1
that image made the cover of @entity193 on april 7 , 1967			0
stars check in even so , celebrities continued to check in , despite and often because of the war ravaging the country			2
in june 1972 , anti-war activist @entity198 arrived at the hotel , and stayed on the second floor for two weeks			2
she spent many hours in the shelter , and autographed a photo taken there for a member of the staff : " @entity206 , with warmest wishes , @entity208 ( peace ) , @entity198			2
" " i consider ms. @entity198 a close friend , " says @entity15			0
" she supported our country and i looked after her both times she visited , first alone and the second time with her son @entity215 and husband @entity215			0
" although the idea of defending the hotel against enemy aircraft with rifle fire seems laughable , its chefs , receptionists , waiters and cleaners were put through their paces by the army and each carried a weapon to guard the hotel against looters			0
while guests retreated to the relative safety of the shelter , the staff was in the open , trying to land a lucky shot when incoming enemy aircraft flew low enough			1
@entity52 : @entity239 jets , the cutest airplanes ever echoes of the past the shelter did make an impression on one other guest : @entity246 folk singer @entity245 , who stayed at the @entity247 during the @entity249 bombings in 1972			0
her song , " where are you now , my son ? " was inspired by her experience in @entity119 and the quiet and resolute perseverance of the @entity24 people			2
the track incorporates live recordings from her hotel stay while bombers raided the city			0
now , standing in the same space four decades later , we crowd around @entity105 's mobile phone in the warm , close space , sweat beading on our foreheads and lips , to listen as @entity245 ' voice interspersed with the unmistakable sound of a wailing @entity24 woman , machine gun fire and bombs exploding cut eerily through the gloom			2
it 's the first time in 40 years that @entity15 has been down to the bunker , and he stands proudly , hand on heart , as he surveys the place in which he 'd spent many nights hoping for peace			2
path of history visitors from all over the world can now retrace the steps of former guests and staff			1
historian @entity288 , who wrote a book on the history of the @entity100 , has helped train six volunteers from @entity119 to lead guests of the hotel on a daily @entity99 , starting with a stroll between 13 glass displays and culminating with the exploration of the shelter			1
among the first to take the inaugural tour on may 21 were @entity82 and @entity299 , a former @entity300 beauty queen and journalist who spent two months in @entity119 in 1968			2
@entity299 had described the shelter in her memoirs as " a long , narrow , semi-subterranean room of concrete which i thought would have made a groovy discotheque			0
" although some had advised @entity105 , only half - jokingly , that he should turn the shelter into a wine cellar for the hotel , he 's glad his determination to preserve the shelter in its wartime state has paid off			1
he believes that the @entity100 bunker will become a destination in its own right , just like the @entity314 in south @entity24			1
" i want people to feel that space ; to transport themselves there in the middle of the conflict , " he says			0
" it 's really a place for reflection			0
if people come out and are a little emotional , that 's mission accomplished for me			0
" to see it for yourself the shelter will be opened as part of the path of history guided tour , held daily at 5 p.m. and open to hotel guests only			1
