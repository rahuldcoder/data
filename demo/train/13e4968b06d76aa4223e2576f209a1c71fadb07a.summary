-- in @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity1 has grown up with her classmates for the past 12 years			2
day in day out , she was a well - liked , self - described " tomboy , " an academically gifted student			2
yet , when her senior picture and any mention of her went missing from the yearbook , it became clear she 'd been removed because of her status as an out lesbian			2
big deal ? to many , the answer is yes			2
how would you feel if someone you love told you he or she was gay ? how would your view evolve in that moment or over time ? could it change ? why would it change ? " do n't tramp on my rights , " my brother @entity21 recently told me at my nephew @entity23 's wedding in @entity25			1
@entity21 was commenting on gay people who want marriage rights			1
somehow , it had become all about him , rather than about them			2
i asked how letting gays marry would infringe on his rights ? " i love the sinner , " he said			1
" the thief , the alcoholic , the adulterer , the homosexual need @entity37 's restoration , not our approval			2
" he is a believer that the " gay can be prayed away , " and that it is , bottom line , a defect caused by the devil			1
@entity0 : get the answers to all your questions about prayer this yearbook deletion goes to the heart of the larger issue : how , as a nation , we 're split on this notion of sexual identity and tolerance			2
we are still split as a nation on what we believe , though it 's more evenly divided today than ever			0
it 's one part belief , another part feeling			0
@entity0 : is there a conflict between homosexuality and spirituality ? @entity67 released its annual findings on sexuality that tell how we have changed			1
as of a couple weeks ago , more than 50 percent of @entity71 now accept gay relationships			1
what 's more , 78 percent of @entity71 now believe gay @entity71 should be allowed to serve in the military , while 48 percent believe gay @entity71 should have the right to marry			1
how are the feelings ? how does this conversation make you feel ? my own parents believed they could cast demons of homosexuality out of people			1
the joke in my family today is one of the demons slithered out the family room window and came in through my bedroom window while i was sleeping			0
truth was , i knew i was gay when i was 4 years old			1
my mom knew i was gay around the same time , as i was smooching on other boys , yet it caused a commotion and distress when i came out in my late teens just the same , and my parents promptly sent me to a " pray away the gay " therapist			1
@entity0 : what it 's like to be gay around the world my brother , who i mentioned earlier , is this kind of therapist			1
every few weeks , i get an email or a call from a family ( usually it 's a mom who reaches out ) asking for my help in doing a " gay intervention " on their kid			1
even as the sexual myths have gone the way of flat @entity121 theories , the way we feel , and the ways we believe sexuality to be , are more often than not based on the biases and beliefs we grew up with			1
i was raised being taught white folks ( us ) should n't date or marry a person of another race or even religion			1
" it 's not @entity37 's ideal for us , " my mother would warn			0
@entity0 : let 's get real about sexuality it 's important to note that in 1968 , only 28 percent of @entity71 supported the legalization of interracial marriage even as loving vs. @entity138 , legalized the very union across the nation that same year			1
it would take until 1991 until @entity71 ' support for it crossed the 50 percent threshold			1
but gay ? is it really all that good ? look , it took me awhile to get used to it being okay , having grown up in a place where what i was , was preached on and spoken of as an abomination			1
i expected my parents to get hip to the trip really quick , and it was n't that way			1
it took years for them to come to some new understanding on gay -- and frankly , it 's still up in the air what my mom would say if you asked her if gays should marry			1
it depends on the day			0
@entity0 : country singer @entity169 on coming out on the other hand , as we have these hard conversations about who we are and who we believe others to be , it 's critical that myths not be counted as fact			0
a human being comes to grips with his or her sexual orientation , finally comes out to the family and then is furious when the family does n't get " hip to the trip " right away ? it happens			2
" i 'm embarrassed to admit that it took me 27 years to get comfortable with the gay thing , and then i expected my family to find acceptance in a minute , " a friend told me recently			2
homosexual creatures are found throughout @entity37 's wild and wonderful animal kingdom			0
it 's not unnatural , i think , just not the norm			0
in @entity3 , the stir was caused by a masculine version of a yearbook photo that said with one look that she was not likely the norm			0
when i came out , my mom was devastated			0
for my whole family , this issue brought them right up against how they felt about what they had been taught			0
they came face - to - face with a bias created in a vacuum			0
but what did they know ? @entity218 says , " i know what i know			0
" i would ask you , is what you know is informed by flat @entity121 theology or feelings based on others ' prejudices ? if the answer is yes , maybe it 's time to pull out your own yearbook and see who made you feel uncomfortable and why ? then , pray on it and come up with your own answer that 's loving and kind , no matter where it falls			0
