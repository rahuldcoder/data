-- in the increasingly globalized world of professional hockey , a plane crash wednesday in @entity4 caused loss and grief halfway around the world in @entity8			1
all members of the @entity11 team of the @entity12 -- including a @entity14 coach and some players with extensive @entity17 experience -- were believed to have been aboard the plane that went down after takeoff from @entity11 , about 250 kilometers ( 160 miles ) northeast of @entity20			1
authorities say 43 of the 45 people aboard were killed			2
there were two survivors : one @entity4 hockey player and a flight attendant			0
" though it occurred thousands of miles away from our home arenas , this tragedy represents a catastrophic loss to the hockey world -- including the @entity17 family , which lost so many fathers , sons , teammates and friends who at one time excelled in our league , " @entity17 commissioner @entity27 said in a statement			1
" our deepest condolences go to the families and loved ones of all who perished			0
" the news came as the @entity17 was reeling from the recent deaths of three current or former enforcers , players whose main contribution is to intimidate and fight			1
the oldest of the three , 35 - year - old @entity53 , was found dead last week in a @entity55 apartment			0
among those believed to have been on the plane that crashed wednesday were @entity58 , a 52 - year - old @entity14 coach who played in the @entity17 for 18 years with @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			1
according to the website of the @entity67 , former teammates were struggling to come to grips with the loss of @entity58 , who was on the team when it won its @entity72 championship in 1989			1
" these things hit you like a ton of bricks , " former @entity67 captain @entity73 told the website , referring to @entity58 by his nickname as a player			2
" you do your best to deal with them and move on			0
right now , we 're talking with our different teammates and trying to come to grips with the reality that ' @entity86 ' is no longer on this @entity87			0
" other players on the @entity11 roster included former @entity17 all - star forward @entity91 , a @entity92 who played 16 seasons for @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 ; longtime @entity17 defenseman @entity99 of the @entity100 , who played for @entity94 , the @entity101 and @entity102 ; @entity4 defenseman @entity103 , who played 14 years in the @entity17 for @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity62 ; @entity108 defenseman @entity107 , who played 12 @entity17 seasons for @entity110 , @entity106 , @entity105 and @entity111 ; and @entity112 from the @entity100 , who played seven seasons for @entity114 and the @entity115			2
@entity91 scored more than 300 goals in his @entity17 career and won the @entity118 for sportsmanship in 2000			2
he was the leading scorer at the @entity120 , narrowly missing an open net that would have tied the score in the final seconds of @entity124 's semifinal match against favored @entity14 , which went on to win the gold medal			2
professional hockey has become much more international in the past three decades , with @entity128 and @entity4 players appearing on every @entity17 roster			1
the @entity12 is a major @entity4 - based professional league that has attracted some @entity17 players , particularly those of @entity4 or east @entity128 descent , with large salaries and top - flight competition			1
though considered a step below the @entity17 , the @entity12 also has lured younger players from @entity128 and @entity14 who are unable to make @entity17 rosters right away			1
that kind of globalization has integrated the hockey world , players say			1
" @entity145 's such a small community , " noted @entity142 , a former @entity17 goalie who once played in @entity4 , on @entity14 's @entity143 1050			1
" it 's that six degrees of separation			0
you ca n't play with somebody who does n't know somebody			0
" while noting that no official fatality list has been announced , @entity142 said : " the names that are being thrown around , you know of them , you played against them , you respect them , you know somebody who was close to them			0
" @entity161 , a veteran @entity4 defenseman for the @entity162 , said he knew some of the players on @entity11 " and it 's very hard to hear , " while longtime senators forward and captain @entity166 of @entity167 said the tragedy of the crash was the loss of " people you know and people you 've been around			2
" @entity142 remembered some flights he described as " hairy " while playing overseas , and he said different countries have different operating standards for airlines			0
" what we 're used to may not translate into what other people deem safe , " he said , adding that " you expect a certain criteria because that 's what you 've grown up with			0
" in @entity4 , he told @entity143 1050 , the system seemed " loose , " with people sitting wherever they chose despite having assigned seats and baggage brought into the cabin			0
" it was just different protocols that i was n't used to , " he said .			0

several former @entity17 players are believed to have been killed in the crash
@entity58 , a @entity14 coach and former *nhler* , was on the plane
