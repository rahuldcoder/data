@entity0 , @entity1 -- the 15 - year - old girl who hanged herself last january after enduring months of bullying from schoolmates failed to alert others to her plight , the superintendent of @entity4 said thursday			1
the girl , @entity18 , " was apparently a very private person ; she bore a lot without talking to friends or with her parents or with anybody at school , " @entity10 told @entity2			1
" she did n't reveal to people what she was being subjected to and , unfortunately , until january 7 , we were not aware of what she was being subjected to , so [ there was ] very little way we could have intervened in the bullying			1
" @entity10 cited two incidents that occurred on january 7			1
in one , a girl walked into a classroom and called @entity31 " an @entity30 slut , " he said			1
the name caller was taken to the principal 's office and disciplined , he said			2
in the other , a girl " said something threatening about @entity35 " to another girl , he said			0
a staff member overheard the comment and reported it to the principal , who took disciplinary action , @entity10 said			1
he said it was school policy not to specify what disciplinary actions may have been taken against any individual student , though he said the latter case did not include expulsion and that the student returned to school			2
" to our knowledge the action taken was effective in ending their involvement in any bullying of @entity35 , " he said			1
@entity31 , who had recently moved with her family from @entity30 to @entity0 , hanged herself on january 14 after enduring what @entity59 district attorney @entity58 described to reporters monday as " a nearly three - month campaign of verbally assaultive behavior and threats of physical harm toward @entity35 , on school grounds , by several @entity68 students			1
" six students were named in an indictment returned by a grand jury friday and made public monday			0
in addition , @entity58 said three female students received juvenile charges , but she would not clarify if they were among the six named in the indictment			2
that left even @entity10 confused			2
" there could be as many as nine , but i believe that six " is the correct number , he said			0
though authorities did not consider that the actions or failures to act by the faculty , staff and administrators of the school amounted to criminal behavior , prosecutor @entity58 called for them to undergo training to learn to intervene more effectively in such cases			2
but administrators in the school district , who oversee the education of 2,100 students in four schools , are being unfairly blamed for the death , @entity10 said			1
those critics include a number of parents who have demanded that the administrators resign			0
" they really do n't know what 's going on in the schools , but they feel that this should n't have happened and that , somehow , it has to be the fault of the schools themselves , " @entity10 said			1
" frankly , i think that grossly oversimplifies the situation			0
" @entity10 said he had received hundreds of vituperative messages from the community			1
" they are awful , " he said , citing one that said he should be " burning in hell			0
" he said he was trying to ignore them			0
none of the six students identified in the indictment remains in school , he added			0
@entity10 said he supported the punishments meted out to the students			2
" if they , as they have been charged , committed crimes , they should face the consequences for those crimes , " he said			0
but , he added , expulsion is something educators are reluctant to countenance			0
" it 's a terrible punishment because that changes their whole lives and what they are capable of doing , and they have to figure out a way to renew and complete their education			0
" @entity2 's @entity140 contributed to this story .			0
