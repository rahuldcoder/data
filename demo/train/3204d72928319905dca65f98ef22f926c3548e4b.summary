@entity1 agents interviewed one of the suspects in the @entity4 bombings two years ago , but found no connection with terror groups			1
an @entity1 official said agents interviewed @entity8 in 2011 at the request of the @entity11 government			1
" the request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical @entity16 and a strong believer , and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the @entity19 for travel to the country 's region to join unspecified underground groups , " the @entity1 said in a statement			1
the @entity1 said it took a number of investigative steps to check on the request , including looking at his travel history , checking databases for derogatory information and searching for web postings			1
agents also interviewed @entity8 's family members , the @entity1 said , but did not detect terrorist activity			1
@entity36 suspects : immigrant dream to @entity19 nightmare " the @entity1 did not find any terrorism activity , domestic or foreign , and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011 , " the @entity1 's statement said			1
" the @entity1 requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government			1
" @entity19 rep. @entity45 , @entity46 and chairman of the @entity48 , said friday that information that @entity8 had been interviewed by the @entity1 in the past was disturbing			1
" it 's new information to me and it 's very disturbing that he 's on the @entity1 's radar screen , " @entity45 told @entity52 's @entity51			1
no immediate suggestion of accomplices in bombings @entity45 praised the @entity1 's efforts investigating the case since monday 's bombings			1
" but if he was on the radar and they let him out of their sights , then that 's an issue , certainly , for me , " @entity45 said			1
the suspects ' parents told @entity11 state media that the @entity1 had been speaking with their sons			1
analysis : older suspect in bombings grew increasingly religious , analysis shows " @entity1 came to them two or three times , asking ' are you @entity81 ? is anyone harassing you ? ' why would anyone offend us ? then they came again			2
said they wanted to talk to @entity8			2
we did n't know what was going on , did n't know whether he had done something			0
but they were saying , ' oh , it 's nothing , it 's just routine			2
' they talked to us at our home , " father @entity92 told the state - run @entity94 news agency			0
" i heard myself that they ( the @entity1 ) said : ' we know that you read , what you drink , what you eat , where you go			2
' and then they added that that 's routine practice to prevent bombings on the streets of @entity36 , so that our kids can go to school in peace			0
this conversation happened half a year ago			0
but i keep asking , why did they have to talk to him about that then ? " mother @entity113 told @entity114 that the @entity1 had been checking on @entity115 for three to five years			1
" they knew what he was doing , what sites he was visiting			0
they followed his every move , yet today they say this is a terrorist act , " she said			0
" the @entity1 was afraid of my eldest son because he was a leader , could stand up for himself , and talked about @entity16 a lot			1
once they officially called me and told me that they do n't doubt his decency			0
but at the same time they said he gets information from extremists ' sites and that they are very afraid of him			0
" earlier friday , a @entity19 official familiar with the latest intelligence information on the @entity4 bombings said initial indications were that the two suspects do not have direct links to any major @entity142 group or affiliates , or to a new significant terrorist threat to the @entity19			0
what their family has to say these are some early assessments but far from final conclusions , the official said			0
the assessments are part of a full interagency review now under way by the @entity19 intelligence and law enforcement community , who are going back through their databases and information looking for any links to the two men			0
the intelligence review earlier friday had focused to a large extent on regional militant connections the men have had in @entity11 or @entity164			2
but the official also noted they simply may have been " inspired " by a militant ideology or may simply have been disgruntled persons aiming to carry out an attack , and had no connections to foreign groups			0
" we simply do n't know yet , " he said			0
the review was ordered by @entity173 , director of national intelligence			0
initially , before the men were identified by the @entity1 , the review was looking at any indications of a threat emerging from overseas against the @entity19			2
once the identities of the men became known , with their possible ethnic @entity181 background , the focus shifted			0
the intelligence community is tasked under the review with checking any intelligence gathered overseas while the @entity1 will focus on what is known inside the @entity19			2
@entity187 congressmen want answers on @entity36 suspect 's 2011 questioning			2

a foreign government told the @entity1 that @entity8 was a follower of radical @entity16

*ultimately* , the @entity1 told the foreign government nothing was found
@entity45 : " if he was on the radar , and they let him out of their sights , then that 's an issue "
