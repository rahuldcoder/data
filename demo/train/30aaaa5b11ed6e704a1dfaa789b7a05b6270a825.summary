-- when we last saw actress @entity3 during primetime , it was on @entity6 's drama , " @entity7			1
" although that show was canceled after one season , @entity8 has kept busy in films mostly , booking parts in " 2012 " and " @entity13			1
" but she 's also done a few one - offs in niche comedy shows like @entity18 ' web series " @entity21 , " comedian @entity19 's sketch comedy show , " @entity22 , " and a guest spot on " @entity24			1
" this week @entity8 returns to primetime with " @entity25 , " a half - hour romantic comedy from " @entity28 " vet @entity27			1
in it she plays @entity31 , a recently divorced lawyer whose wet - blanket approach to life is challenged by her active , surfer carpenter , @entity34 ( played by @entity35 )			2
rounding out the cast is @entity37 ( " @entity41 " ) , @entity38 ( " @entity42 " ) and @entity39 ( " @entity40 )			0
@entity0 spoke with @entity8 from her home in @entity45 about the " @entity7 " days , finding her footing as a comedic actress and the things that keep her up at night			1
@entity0 : " @entity25 " marks a proper return to network tv for you			1
has the tv landscape changed , in your opinion ? @entity3 : it seems like it 's contracting , fewer and fewer jobs			1
it 's hard to discern what 's what , since i 'm now a 40 - year - old woman			1
am i over the hill at the same time there 's a recession ? it 's hard to decide what 's what			1
there are n't many roles that are interesting if you 're a 40 - year - old woman , unless you 're @entity71 or @entity72			2
@entity0 : looking back , what was the issue with " @entity7 " ? @entity8 : i think it was too expensive and there was too much anticipation			1
i guess all together we seemed like this arrogant monolith , but individually , none of us felt very arrogant			0
so it 's kind of curious			2
the backlash , the vitriol			0
if it had been some 30 - or 35 - year - old new discovery instead of @entity83 , things might have been different			2
@entity0 : in " @entity25 " you play an uptight , divorced lawyer			1
the crux of the humor rests on her being uptight			0
do you think uptight people are funny ? @entity8 : i do			1
someone says comedy is rigidity			2
in a romantic comedy it 's usually a good idea to have people who ca n't stand the fact that they are attracted to each other			1
@entity0 : are you yourself uptight ? @entity8 : yes			1
my husband would say yes			0
i try to be really hippie about things			0
i 'm uptight in all the ways that are really important , but the things my husband and family can benefit from my uptightness , i 'm completely lacking			0
i do n't clean , i do n't make the bed			0
i just do n't worry about socks on the floor			0
plane flights , my children 's well being , my sanity			2
there 's this woman who walks on @entity125 , in the same outfit			2
tiny shorts , knee socks and this visor and a full face of makeup			0
she waves to invisible people			0
when i look at her , i slow down the car , i feel for her and i feel like i 'm one little breathe away from that			0
@entity0 : do audiences think of you as a comedic actress ? @entity8 : i do n't know			1
hopefully they think that i do n't blow			0
@entity0 : recently , you 've done these one off 's with niche comedy shows like @entity18 ' " @entity21 , " " @entity22 , " as well as " @entity24			1
" what 's your strongest suit in comedy ? @entity8 : one needs good writings and there are many comedians that i 'm friends with that are n't apart of the comedy scene ; it 's very hard to break in and be taken serious as a comedic actress			1
it just takes one good role and some eye traffic and that 's hard to come by			0
oftentimes you 're just the setup for the joke			0
like in volleyball -- set and spike			0
that involves some comedic skill , but it 's also frustrating			1
on " @entity25 , " i really feel like @entity27 [ @entity165 , creator ] threw me the ball			2
if we get a chance to go , it would get funnier and funnier			0
if you take " cheers " and " @entity174 " and watch the early shows , they 're kind of awkward			0
it took a while for the writers and everything to gel			0
" @entity25 " premieres wednesday at 9 p.m. et on @entity6 .			2

@entity8 's last full - time tv *gig* was the *acclaimed* , short - lived " @entity7 "
her new show , " @entity25 , " is a comedy
she hopes audiences see her as a comedic actress
