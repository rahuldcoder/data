-- yet again , politics and race got mixed up together today , and this time with an added bonus -- adoption			0
in a segment on her @entity8 show , host @entity5 highlighted @entity10 's family photo , in which the former @entity12 presidential candidate held his newly adopted @entity14 grandson on his knee			1
she encouraged her panel to " caption that " picture			2
what followed was unfortunate , thoughtless commentary from the panel			1
( one of the panelists , @entity22 , appears on @entity0 shows and writes op - eds for @entity0			0
) the exchange was a cold reminder of us of just how easy it is to flippantly do harm , and also of the dearth of understanding and sensitivity surrounding race and adoption i am a transracial adoptee and advocate for children and families , so the complexities of race and adoption resonate on a personal level			1
i see myself in that @entity10 family photo			1
i was adopted from foster care when i was about 8 months old			0
my white parents recall that during the adoption process , there was little conversation about race or what it meant to have a baby of another race enter the family			0
the " non-identifying " adoption records i received as an adult articulated the agency 's noncommittal stance on my race and noted that there was a birthmark present that " could indicate " i was of mixed race			2
with the reality that race was not something that was going to be discussed , how could anyone expect me or my family to know how to deal with issues of race and adoption ? there was little to no education , so we were left to our own devices			2
when people did and said insensitive and cruel things , my sturdy @entity77 parents simply loved me and cared for me the very best they could			0
according to a 2007 @entity80 , about 40 % of adoptions in @entity82 are transracial ( most are international adoptions ) and that number is growing			1
most transracial adoptions are with white adoptive parents			1
while there is a strong sense of community support surrounding many intercountry adoptions -- such as from @entity92 and @entity93 -- black and white adoptions tends to be more polarizing			1
thankfully , more resources are available today than during my 1971 adoption			0
families can proactively seek out books , online help and support groups to be more in tune with the needs of their adopted children			1
but they have to be self - starters because transracial adoption is poorly studied and not tracked appropriately			2
what 's lacking are longitudinal studies that focus on the transracial adoption experience			1
without these , it 's difficult to create and target additional programs and support systems , indeed to even make the case that they are needed			1
while to many , research that would yield such information would be useful and important , it seems to fall low on the funding priority list			0
because of this , available data is old , limited and often inconsistent			0
this might also have something to do with issues of class , race and history that for many attend the idea of white parents adopting black and brown babies			2
today there is no set national standard for training pre-adoptive parents that want to adopt a child of another race			0
some agencies make it their mission to do as much as they can to prepare families , while others simply do not include differences in race and what that means to a family as part of their training			2
against this backdrop , the misbegotten @entity8 jokes hurt			1
they are another reminder that adoptive families need to be always at the ready to support their children on matters of race and adoption			1
white parents will never fully understand what it means to be black or brown , but they can and should do their best to support their children			2
and they should have help : even the best adoptions managed by well - trained practitioners should offer robust post-adoption services and education that includes the language and tools to help adopted children as they grow and develop			0
when someone says or does something careless , the people that should know how to comfort the adopted person should not be at a loss			0
i remember in my white neighborhood that people during the summer would ask me if i was a " fresh air " child			0
while i did not understand it , i got the distinct impression that i did not belong where i was for some strange reason			0
and kids in my school would throw out barbs such as " at least i know who my real parents are			0
" so often , the thoughtlessness and carelessness of others results in deep pain for adoptees , who are already faced with navigating a life - ong search for identity that begins with losing their original family			1
i ca n't help but feel for innocent little @entity196 as he is singled out at the very beginning of his adoption journey			0
when transracial adoption is mocked , it only works to undermine the foundation adoptees and adoptive families are trying to build			1
one hopes @entity196 's parents received guidance before adopting him on the challenges they could face			1
insensitivity , ignorance and intolerance will fuel negative comments			0
the answer is to better to prepare and educate adoptive parents , practitioners , educators and the media to the sensitivities of adoption and race			1
@entity219 adoption children should be protected and empowered , not singled out and mocked			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			2

april @entity222 : @entity8 panel 's flip jokes about @entity10 's *grandchild* were thoughtless
she is a transracial adoptee and says such adoptions have scant guidance or support
she says @entity8 jokes hurt and do n't help adoptees already facing identity issues
@entity222 : @entity239 adoptive families need preparation and media should be sensitive
