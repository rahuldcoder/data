-- these are tough times for hard - working families			0
too many @entity3 are either unemployed or underemployed			0
families are juggling bills they ca n't pay			0
many believe they are working harder but only falling farther and farther behind			0
worse yet , some @entity3 have given up looking for work altogether			2
according to the june unemployment report , the number of @entity3 actively searching for a job is at a three - decade low			2
of those who found a job , nearly one in three had to settle for part - time work			1
so , it may be surprising to learn that more than 4.5 million open jobs went unfilled the month before			0
although several factors contributed to these numbers , in this weak economy , many @entity3 are not equipped with the necessary knowledge and training for high - demand careers in the changing 21st century job market			1
fifty - two percent of adults have not been trained with the literacy skills needed for success in the workforce			0
and two - thirds of @entity3 with disabilities do not participate in the workforce at all			0
the status quo is n't working			0
there are more than 50 workforce development programs spread across nine federal agencies meant to help people find meaningful employment			1
these programs are well intended , but unfortunately , even with a price tag of nearly $ 18 billion each year to taxpayers , very few have been evaluated to determine if the programs even work			1
simply put : our nation 's job training system is overly complex and terribly failing those who need it most			1
that 's why we are proud to support the @entity47 ( @entity48 803 ) which renews our nation 's workforce training laws for the first time in more than a decade			1
this overwhelmingly bipartisan bill , which passed the @entity53 earlier this week , will improve our nation 's workforce development system , improve job opportunities for the underemployed , and , most importantly , help put millions of unemployed @entity3 back to work			1
in this stagnant economy , it is more important than ever that we create a system to prepare workers for 21st century jobs and help businesses find the skilled employees needed to grow a healthy economy			0
the @entity66 improves the workforce development system by eliminating 15 duplicative programs , empowering local boards to tailor training services to their region 's specific needs , and supporting access to real - world education and development through on - the - job training			1
this bipartisan bill also aligns workforce development programs with economic development and education initiatives			1
furthermore , it lets businesses identify in - demand skills and connect workers with the opportunities to build those skills			0
by demanding more effective and more accountable government programs , the act will reform the workforce development system in a way that will provide real results to those searching for jobs at a lower cost to taxpayers			2
the bill is a great example of what @entity97 can accomplish when both sides come to the table to work toward the common good			2
while it took a more than a year for the @entity104 to get on board , once implemented , the act will help @entity3 -- from recent college graduates to veterans to dads looking for work since the recession began -- find good - paying jobs that build a foundation for easier lives and more opportunities			1
so , what 's next ? the bill is headed to the president 's desk because senate majority leader @entity119 chose to finally work with @entity120			1
we hope he will do the same with dozens of other jobs bills collecting dust in the @entity104			0
after all , while this legislation is a step in the right direction , there is much more work to do to build a healthy economy			2
join us on @entity131 / @entity130 .			0

rep. @entity133 , 11 other @entity120 *members* back @entity47 and @entity66
the act , they say , hopes to *update* job training laws and put millions back to work
they say there are already more than 50 programs costing $ 18 billion each year
the bill will eliminate 15 programs seen as duplicative and *retool* training needs locally
