using game theory and data analytics , a group of political scientists predicted @entity5 's current turmoil back in 2011 as the @entity7 regime was falling , and is now working to forecast the country 's future			1
in november 2011 , a few months after @entity7 had been ousted by the @entity5 revolution , the scientists predicted that in the final evolution of @entity5 's transitional democratic phase , the military would allow for semi-free elections but would still act as custodians of the country and the true center of power in the short to medium term			1
" but as we predicted , when any opposition party comes into power , they only have a year or so to deliver their promises -- and most of the time they ca n't			0
and that 's what led us to where we are today , " said @entity26 , a political scientist and co-creator of @entity28 , a large - data predictive analysis model that 's used by the @entity30 and other governments in predicting , preventing and stopping cycles of violence			2
@entity5 to take to streets again @entity26 's team used complex computer algorithm logic games , that measure how people interact with one another , to draw different scenarios of how segments of @entity5 society , power brokers , religious sectors and other sociopolitical variables would affect the outcome of the transition			2
@entity26 's report also concluded that " the military will act as a safety net against rising anti-israeli and anti-american sentiment and ultimately the military and intelligence apparatus will act against extremism that may emerge in the democratic process			0
" " at that time with societal pressure , @entity5 protesting on the streets and calling for change , the @entity60 and @entity61 were the best credible alternatives to @entity7 , " @entity26 said			2
" in november 2011 , what we showed was even though the majority of the @entity5 society was in favor of ousting @entity7 , the @entity5 military was at the time going to support the newly elected regime , but not fully accept it for a long - term solution			0
" using what he calls " mapping and tracking , " @entity26 and his team studied political , religious and civil society elements and the influence of international , regional and @entity5 groups to form their analysis			0
" we mapped who are the stakeholders , their interests on the political issues and what they are going to do with @entity7			0
and once we did that , using game theory , we get a good map to track , " a method @entity26 and his team continue to use in forecasting what 's next for @entity5			1
when a coup is not called a coup @entity61 's departure a ' reset ' for constitution , government according to @entity26 's new report , set to be released within the next few days , there will be acceleration to a presidential election and the change of constitution , where most likely @entity104 will emerge as the top presidential contender			1
@entity104 regarded as outsider within @entity5 @entity104 , a former director general of the @entity107 and a @entity109 laureate , told @entity110 on thursday that @entity61 's departure will serve as a " reset , " so @entity5 can start over in forming a constitution and putting together an inclusive government			1
with many of the @entity60 members detained since @entity61 's fall , @entity104 acknowledged the need for a cohesive society that meets the needs of the @entity5 people and incorporates all sectors of the society			1
" my fear is that the @entity60 will fear that they are excluded			0
we need a quick delivery			0
and we need a cohesive society that is tolerant , that respects each other 's differences , " he said			0
with more than $ 1.3 billion of aid from the @entity133 at stake for the @entity5 military , the interim government 's next move is key in determining the geopolitics of the region , including its relations with the @entity133 , the @entity140 and @entity141			1
" the military will continue to be pro-american , because of its reliance on @entity133 foreign aid and military assistance , and the @entity5 who would be running in the future will be smart enough not to bring conflict with the @entity133 , " said @entity142 , a member of the @entity143 who has also worked closely with @entity5 government officials			1
@entity133 president @entity151 on wednesday refrained from calling @entity61 's ouster a " coup , " as such a statement would legally oblige the @entity133 to stop the flow of military aid to @entity5			1
@entity133 allies will take wait and see approach @entity26 said the @entity133 and the @entity140 are taking a wait and see approach , and his upcoming forecast predicts the @entity133 and its allies will " move cautiously and solely in support of the new government , but wo n't take a strong stance because of the risks of potential implications throughout the region			2
" @entity151 , advisers discuss ' fluid ' situation in @entity5 he added that based on his group 's analytics , the current military leadership does not want to be the sole political entity ruling the country and sees itself as only the custodian of the society			2
" we predict that the military would support this parallel track of elections and constitutional reform that would be done in a more democratic fashion ; and the @entity133 and its allies will wait to see the outcome of this process and then decide on their strategic approach toward @entity5			1
" but @entity26 says his models also forecast severe civil conflicts and the likelihood of " attacks from the @entity60 , especially in the troubled @entity194 region			0
" " unfortunately we foresee strong potential for more bloodshed , where regular @entity5 are the casualties -- so the faster the military ensures and delivers the constitutional and democratic reform , the better it is for the people and avoiding a civil conflict , " he said			0
why @entity133 should care about @entity5			0

team predicted that @entity61 's government had only a year or so to deliver
data analyzed came from factors inside and outside of @entity5
model predicts that the military will continue ties to @entity133 to keep military aid flowing
team suggests that violence will *intensify* before it abates
