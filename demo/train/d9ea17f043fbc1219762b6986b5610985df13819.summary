there 's a lot of sky - is - falling doomsday predictions about the @entity4 on @entity5 , which opens monday in @entity6 with some 190 - plus nations discussing the global internet 's future			1
that 's because much of the accompanying proposals from the global community have been kept under lock and key , although some of the positions of nations have been leaked and published online			1
the idea behind the meetings is to update the @entity20 governed by the @entity21 , a @entity22 agency known as the @entity21 , that is responsible for global communication technologies			1
but the outcome of the two - week session is n't likely to make much change , as no proposal will be accepted if not agreed to by all nations			1
and the biggest fear — that the session will lead to net censorship — has already come to pass			1
" member @entity31 already have the right , as stated in @entity34 of the @entity35 of @entity21 , to block any private telecommunications that appear ' dangerous to the security of the @entity38 or contrary to its laws , to public order or to decency			2
' the treaty regulations can not override the @entity35 , " said @entity43 , the @entity21 secretary - general			2
@entity45 , a policy attorney with the @entity46 , said proposals by various governments to treat internet connections like the telephone system are cause for concern regarding privacy and the unfettered , free flow of information			2
but there is no " doomsday " internet kill switch scenario , she said			2
" there 's not going to be some kind of doomsday scenario that there 's a treaty that makes the internet go dark , " @entity45 said			1
" what we 're seeing is governments putting forward visions of the internet and having discussions			2
" the last time the @entity72 global treaty was considered was in 1988			0
but technology has changed dramatically in the past 25 years			0
on the table for discussion are spectrum and technology standards to improve global interoperability and efficiency			0
cybersecurity , spam and data retention are also on the table			0
@entity83 , executive director of @entity84 , a digital rights group , is livid that the debate will be done largely in secret , with limited input from stakeholders			0
" the @entity21 and its member states have attempted to respond to our criticisms and other challenges about the @entity94 , but they fail to address the critical flaw : it 's a closed , government - controlled agency that should not be making decisions about internet policy , " he said			1
" such decisions necessarily require the participation of governments and the private sector and civil society			0
" the @entity31 is battling plans to treat the internet like the telephone when it comes to transmission agreements			0
some @entity112 and @entity111 members are calling for so - called termination fees , in which networks where a web session begins must pay the routing cost for the session 's destination — like phone companies work with phone calls			0
" that model , in general , lends itself to fewer providers , higher prices , slower take - up of internet , slower economic growth , " said @entity122 , the head of the @entity31 delegation			0
@entity45 said termination fees , which would obviously be paid for by consumers , also opens the door to more internet monitoring			1
" you can also read it as a campaign , " she said , " to make all internet communication more traceable and more trackable , invading users ' privacy			1
" the dot - nxt site has published a clearinghouse of leaked documents regarding member proposals .			0
