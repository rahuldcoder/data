-- do you need to be a jockey to ride a horse ? do you need to be a doctor to run a hospital ? maybe not in all cases , but a new study suggests that you will be more successful in management if you have skills specific to your realm of operations			1
these days the trend is very much toward professional managers -- executives who swap industries as they please			0
however , in the rarified world of @entity17 at least , it appears that it pays to employ from within			2
and with an average annual team budget of $ 173 million , there is pressure to get it right			0
" former top drivers , such as @entity25 , consistently turn into successful @entity17 bosses -- even when we account for factors such as the resources available to each team , " says @entity21 of @entity23 's @entity22			1
@entity31 : @entity17 's joker in the pack ? @entity34 co-authored a study which discovered that @entity17 teams managed by individuals who know the sport inside out win twice as many races as their general manager counterparts			1
examining all 18,000 @entity17 races from 1950 - 2011 , the study revealed that former drivers and mechanics are significantly more successful than those with degrees in engineering or who were managers by trade			1
@entity25 , for example , is now president of motorsport 's ruling body the @entity51			0
following a 15 - year rally driving career and a stint as @entity57 's director of racing , he joined @entity59 's @entity17 setup			1
having been responsible for bringing @entity61 to the team , the @entity60 later became the @entity59 's chief executive			0
while he presided over multiple world titles , his 2008 replacement @entity65 -- a business school graduate -- has struggled to repeat the success of the @entity61 era , winning nothing			0
" we can see why comparative newcomers like @entity73 and @entity74 are doing so well in @entity17			1
these teams may not have a 50 - year history like @entity59 but they are led by hands - on experts with deep intuition , " @entity34 said			0
@entity73 , formed from the @entity81 team in 2005 , has dominated the past two years with world titles in both driver and manufacturer categories			2
the @entity86 - owned marque is led by @entity87 , who started out as a racing driver in @entity17 's development divisions before running his own team in his mid- 20s			1
@entity74 's restored fortunes have come since founder @entity92 rebought the team from @entity94 in 2009 -- though the 68 - year - old is gradually handing over control to chief executive @entity97 , whose background is in law			0
the authors of the @entity102 report say the study shows that being a capable general manager may no longer be sufficient , and that employees respond better to leaders who have a deep understanding of their trade			1
in fact , a previous study conducted by the same authors discovered that hospitals headed by doctors perform better than those led by professional managers			0
" from an early age , driver - leaders develop technical knowledge about the underlying activity of grand prix racing , " the @entity17 study states			1
" they acquire extensive experience in formulating driving tactics , and are able to make decisions under time pressure and stress			0
this inherent knowledge and industry expertise may , we suggest , inform organizational strategy when drivers become principals			0
" we also argue that former drivers may appear more credible to their @entity17 team colleagues , which extends their influence			2
finally , because of a shared value system between the team and leader , driver - leaders may create a more appropriate work environment for the team			2

study shows " expert " leaders win twice as many @entity17 races as their rivals
the study looked at every @entity17 race from 1950 - 2011
claims made by the study even translated into other businesses outside of motorsport
@entity73 boss @entity87 is an example of a successful former driver
