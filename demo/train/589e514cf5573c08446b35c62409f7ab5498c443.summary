@entity1 president @entity0 says his regime is apprised of @entity5 - led coalition efforts against @entity6 in his country -- not by the @entity5 , but through third parties such as @entity9			1
" sometimes , they convey a message , a general message , but there 's nothing tactical , " he told the @entity10			2
" there is no dialogue			0
there 's , let 's say , information , but not dialogue			2
" several @entity22 countries have clamored for @entity0 to step down since 2011 , when peaceful protests against his regime led to a violent government crackdown and , subsequently , a full - on civil war			1
but now , @entity5 allies and the @entity1 regime have a common enemy : @entity6 , which is trying to solidify an @entity31 state across swaths of @entity9 and @entity1			1
in the broad @entity10 interview , @entity0 said @entity1 wo n't join the international coalition trying to " degrade and destroy " @entity6			1
" no , definitely we can not and we do n't have the will and we do n't want , for one simple reason : because we can not be in an alliance with countries which support terrorism , " he said			0
for years , @entity0 's government has used the term " terrorists " to describe radical militants as well as members of the @entity1 opposition			1
even though @entity5 - led warplanes have been striking @entity6 targets in @entity1 -- using the country 's airspace along with the regime -- @entity0 said he does n't speak with @entity5 officials			1
" no , because they do n't talk to anyone unless it 's a puppet , and they easily trample over international law , which is about our sovereignty now , " he said in the interview			0
" so they do n't talk to us , we do n't talk to them			0
" @entity64 said the messages about @entity5 - led coalition efforts have been coming " through third - party , more than one - party , @entity9 and other countries			1
" " we knew about the campaign before it started , " he said			0
" but we did n't know details			0
" in the interview , @entity0 flatly denied that his military is using barrel bombs in rebel - controlled areas , even though opposition activists report near - daily barrel bombs raining from regime helicopters			1
barrel bombs are filled with explosives and other objects , such as nails , to produce maximum carnage			1
human rights activists say these bombs are particularly abhorrent because they kill and maim indiscriminately , often civilians			2
" i know about the army			0
they use bullets , missiles and bombs			2
i have n't heard of the army using barrels or maybe cooking pots , " @entity0 told the @entity10			1
" there 's no indiscriminate weapons			0
when you shoot , you aim			0
and when you aim , you aim at terrorists in order to protect civilians -- again if you 're talking about casualties , that 's war			0
you can not have war without casualties			0
" the @entity109 has said about 200,000 people have been killed in the civil war			0
on tuesday , the opposition group @entity112 reported more barrel bombs falling on the provinces of @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 -- the birthplace of the uprising			1
on top of the staggering death toll , the civil war has also left 12.2 million @entity1 in need of humanitarian aid , @entity109 assistant secretary - general @entity120 said last month			2
many have been choked off from food and medical care as the military besieged rebel - held cities			0
but in his @entity10 interview , @entity0 defended the blockades			1
" in most of the areas where the rebels take over , the civilians fled and come to our areas , " he said			0
" so most of the areas that we encircle and attack are only filled with militants			1
" @entity142 take key ground near @entity144 ; @entity145 resumes strikes against @entity6			2

@entity0 says he is getting information , but nothing tactical , about @entity5 - led efforts against @entity6
he denies that the government has been using barrel bombs to attack opposition - controlled areas
