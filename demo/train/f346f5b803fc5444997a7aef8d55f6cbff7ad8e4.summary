-- @entity1 may be a city built on the profits of oil and gas , but it has a green dream			1
the dream is to create a city that is " more liveable , walkable and bikeable , " according @entity7			1
@entity7 has been the director of sustainability for @entity1 since 2010 , when current mayor @entity9 was elected			1
they have launched several sustainability initiatives under the " @entity13 " program and @entity9 says the city has cut its greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter			1
@entity7 's previous work includes a solar - panel incentive program in @entity18 , as well as directing the creation of its alternative - fuel bus fleet			1
she spoke with @entity0 's @entity18 about the challenges @entity1 is facing and how she wants to get @entity1 out of their cars and out on the streets			1
@entity0 : why is @entity1 trying to be more sustainable ? @entity7 : we are known as producing oil and gas , but we also produce other resources that are important to our economy and to the sustainability			1
for us it 's about being green , but it 's also about saving resources and money and being a very efficient and affordable city			2
the number one thing to think about is trying to improve the health and the quality of life of the citizens			0
@entity0 : does @entity1 have any geographical advantages or disadvantages ? @entity42 : @entity1 is a very hot and humid city , so there 's a lot of air conditioning which leads to buildings consuming a lot of energy			1
we want to work on an initiative trying to get people out of their cars and to use less energy in their homes			0
that can prove to be quite the challenge			0
an advantage we have is that we can make great use of the wind			2
@entity60 is the largest wind ( power ) producer in the @entity64 ; we now produce 12,000 megawatts of wind ( power )			0
@entity0 : if you had a magic wand , how would you use it for your work ? @entity42 : i would want every building to reduce their energy usage by 20 % by 2020			1
i would also love more people to commute less to work , by living closer or by using alternative transportation			0
@entity1 is still very much a car city			1
@entity0 : where does your passion for the environment come from ? @entity42 : i care about the quality of life ; the air we breathe and the water we drink			1
i think it 's really imperative for governments to create healthy cities so people can go out and do other great things			2
if you increase the health of citizens , it automatically makes cities more attractive , which in turn brings more people to cities , which improves the economy			0
a lot of people have told me that they came to @entity1 for a job , but stayed because the city is starting to focus on the quality of life			1
@entity0 : what difficulties have you encountered ? @entity42 : we have lots of issues with hurricanes but the thing we had n't had an issue with before was droughts like the one we had two years ago			2
it definitely made us think about how we build infrastructure and how we can try to forecast and prepare for extreme weather events			0
we need to realize that it 's not just going to be storms in the future			0
the climate can change on a dime			0
@entity0 : how far have you come in your work ? @entity42 : right now we are experiencing a boom when it comes to transportation			2
three more rail lines will open next year			0
we have also started planning for a bus rapid transit line , so we are encouraging the use of electric vehicles			0
@entity0 : what goals do you want to achieve by 2020 ? @entity42 : we are going to see a more liveable , walkable and bikeable @entity1 , and a population that is craving that and nothing less			1
reduced energy usage , increased transportation options and generally a greener city			2
our streets will work differently			0
with density comes the desire for streets to look differently , to accommodate restaurants , bike lanes and be aesthetically pleasing at the same time			0
the more you change your streets and try to open them up , the more people are outside , so it 's exciting !			0
