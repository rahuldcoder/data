there 's no " hey , baby , what 's your sign ? " button			1
but if you have a friend with a mysteriously undefined love life , @entity6 may have just become a little more like a singles bar at closing time			1
a new " ask " feature lets you ping friends who have n't set their @entity13 and ask them what 's up			1
@entity6 has been quietly rolling out the feature for testing in select countries , including the @entity17			1
clicking on " ask " brings up a dialogue box with the text , " let ( your friend ) know why you 're asking for ( his / her ) relationship status			2
" it provides space to expand upon your request -- say , to invite them out for drinks			0
a @entity6 spokeswoman said that similar " ask " buttons have been available on mobile and web for a few months for other profile information			1
" this feature provides an easy way for friends to ask you for information that 's not already on your profile , " @entity6 spokeswoman @entity35 said in an e-mail			1
" for example , a friend could ask where you work or for your hometown			1
if you choose to answer , this information is then added to your profile			0
by default , only you and your friend can see it , and you also have the option of sharing it with others , too			2
" well , that sounds a little less like an overture from someone who 's hitting on you			2
or for that matter , a @entity58			0
and , yes , even the relationship - status version presumably will have non-stalkery applications			0
a friend just checking in			0
someone who was at your wedding and offering a gentle reminder for you to update your page			0
or ... you know ... your mom , who remains convinced you 're just not trying hard enough to find mr. or ms. right			0
as noted , a user may reply to the person who sent the request without updating their status , though they are given an opportunity to do so			0
and it 's surely not lost on @entity6 that relationship status is a handy piece of information for advertisers trying to target their ads. still , some commenters on @entity86 found the new feature a little ... creepy			1
" are you single or taken ? @entity6 now lets you ask someone out in the most awkward way possible , " said @entity88 .			2

@entity6 adds " ask " feature to let users inquire about friends ' relationships
" ask " button *appears* next to info that 's not filled out
only friends can inquire , and *receiver* may respond *privately*
users can also " ask " about a friend 's *job* or hometown
