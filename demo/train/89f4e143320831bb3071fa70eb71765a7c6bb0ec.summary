smartphones may attract nearly all of the marketing hype and news coverage , but @entity5 's latest statistics show that smartphones still comprise only a minority of the @entity9 mobile market -- about 35 % , as of july 2011			1
the other 65 % of @entity9 mobile handsets in use are " feature phones " -- which tend to be much less expensive to buy and own			1
often , these phones do not require a pricey two - year wireless service contract with hefty early termination fees			2
even though smartphones cost much more , these devices have been getting popular with @entity9 consumers , even in light of the country 's economic recession			1
after all , a 35 % market share is nothing to sneeze at -- especially considering that smartphones have only been widely available in the @entity9 for about five years			1
at some point , a majority of @entity9 mobile users will indeed own smartphones			1
but that shift wo n't happen as quickly as early forecasts anticipated			0
back in march 2010 , the @entity31 proclaimed that smartphones would overtake feature phones by 2011			1
specifically , they predicted that by the end of @entity37 ( about a month from now ) , most @entity9 mobile users would own smartphones			1
that ambitious prediction does n't seem to be panning out			0
for over a year , @entity5 has been publishing monthly mobile - market - share statistics that show the percentage of @entity9 smartphones			1
i 've been tracking these figures			0
based on this data , it looks like it 'll be roughly october 2012 before smartphones actually take over as a majority of @entity9 handsets			1
that 's about a year later than @entity31 's forecast			0
even then , there will still be plenty of feature phones in the @entity9 market for quite a while			1
they 're definitely not vanishing any time soon			0
what might speed up or slow down the proliferation of smartphones in the @entity9 ? it 's mostly a cost - benefit tradeoff			1
decisions about which mobile phone to purchase are driven by functionality ( what people want to do with their phones ) , access ( the quality , speed , and geographic availability of local wireless networks ) , cost ( both up - front and monthly bills ) , and flexibility ( the ability to switch carriers , plans , or to cancel at will )			2
right now smartphones win in terms of functionality because people can use apps to do almost anything a much bulkier computer would let them do			2
still , many consumers prefer simpler phones , and view the mobile app frenzy as a confusing and unnecessary excess			2
this market segment ( and it 's not just determined by age , education , or income ) will probably keep using feature phones the longest			1
access divides on urban and rural lines			0
once you get outside of major metro areas , wireless coverage gets spottier			0
also , carriers are very slow to roll out faster " @entity104 " networks in less - populated rural areas			0
using a smartphone on a slow or spotty data network can be pretty painful , and might not seem worth the extra cost			0
in terms of overall cost and flexibility , feature phones are the clear winners -- which is probably why they remain so popular			1
it 's easy to get a pretty good , no - contract feature phone for $ 50 or less ( or even for free ) , and then get a month - to - month or pre-paid plan that allows web browsing , e-mail , and other data access			2
that costs around $ 50 per month			0
generally users can cancel these phones at any time , with no early termination fee			2
in contrast , smartphones typically cost $ 100 or more ( sometimes much more ) at a subsidized price on a two - year contract from a wireless service provider			2
monthly bills typically start at $ 80 - 90 , and if you want to cancel early you 'll still owe the carrier up to a few hundred dollars for an early termination fee			2
if the overall @entity9 economy improves significantly -- and especially if lots more full - time jobs get created soon -- it 's likely that smartphones would take over sooner			1
but if the recovery continues at its current pace or slows , feature phones could remain the majority into 2013 or beyond			1
it 's also possible that manufacturing advances could bring the cost of smartphones down			2
or the major @entity9 carriers might decide to offer more smartphones on more flexible and consumer - friendly terms			1
personally , i 'm not holding my breath for either of these outcomes			0
the good news is that , for people who stick with feature phones , those devices are n't as limited as they used to be			1
one of the biggest areas of improvement in the @entity9 feature phone market is the web browser			1
most feature phones come with some kind of web browser , and users can opt to pay a little extra for a data plan that allows them to access the mobile internet			1
it used to be the case that feature phones came packaged with horrible , frustrating and slow browsers that displayed most web pages poorly or not at all			1
but now it 's fairly easy for most @entity9 consumers to find feature phones that include a much better pre-installed web browser such as @entity176 or @entity177			1
these display most web pages pretty well and are easy to use , offering a vastly superior mobile browsing experience			2
according to @entity182 , @entity183 's @entity9 regional manager , @entity9 consumers can currently purchase @entity185 feature phones that do n't require a two - year contract from @entity187 and @entity188 ( a brand from @entity189 ) -- and by this holiday season also from @entity190			1
( the stock @entity187 mobile browser is actually a branded version of @entity176			0
) discount carriers such as @entity195 and third - party retailers such as @entity197 generally do n't yet offer feature phones pre-installed with better proxy browsers			1
but any feature phone owners usually can download a better browser for free			0
the possible drawback is that once installed , it may take some extra clicks to launch			0
@entity176 and @entity177 offer additional benefits that may appeal to smartphone owners , too			0
these browsers , and others like them , are " proxy browsers " which compress data significantly before transmitting it to the phone			0
this means they load web pages faster , and they help control mobile data consumption			0
so if you 're on a tiered data plan , even if you own a smartphone it might be a good idea to install a proxy browser			0
using it can help you avoid hitting your data cap , getting charged for overages , or even getting throttled			0
this will probably work well enough for most of your web browsing , and you can switch to a fully - featured non-proxy browser for sites that warrant it			0
some proxy browsers are specifically designed for smartphones			0
@entity176 offers versions for all smartphone platforms , @entity177 has @entity238 versions , and @entity239 offers @entity241 and @entity242 versions that also play flash video ( something still not fully supported by @entity246 's @entity245 )			0
but if you want to stick with a feature phone for a while , do n't worry too			0
you 'll probably still get a good - enough mobile online experience if your phone has a decent mobile browser			2
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity256 .			0

approximately 65 % of @entity9 mobile phones are " feature phones "
smartphones have only been widely available in the @entity9 for about five years
it 'll be roughly october 2012 before smartphones actually take over as a majority
