@entity0 -- @entity3 began dumping thousands of tons of radioactive water into the @entity6 on monday , an emergency move officials said was needed to curtail a worse leak from the crippled @entity9 nuclear power plant			1
in all , about 11,500 tons of radioactive water that has collected at the nuclear facility will be dumped into the sea , officials said monday , as workers also try to deal with a crack that has been a conduit for contamination			1
the radiation levels were highest in the water that was being drained from reactor no. 6 , the officials said			1
these are the latest but hardly the only challenges facing workers at the embattled power plant and its six reactors , which have been in constant crisis since last month 's ruinous earthquake and tsunami			1
officials with @entity29 , which runs the plant , proposed the release of excess water that has pooled in and around the @entity34 5 and 6 reactors into the sea			1
but most of the dumped water -- 10,000 tons -- will come from the plant 's central waste treatment facility , which will then be used to store highly radioactive water from the no. 2 unit , an official with the power company said			1
the water in reactors @entity34 5 and 6 is coming from a subdrain and was n't inside the building itself , officials said			1
tests suggest that groundwater is the source of the contamination in these two units , but they are not certain			1
@entity3 chief cabinet secretary @entity55 called the dumping " unavoidable			1
" the liquid was most likely contaminated in the process of trying to cool nuclear fuel rods			0
the scope of the dump was staggering			0
" for an idea about how much is 11,500 tons , one metric ton is 1,000 kilograms or about 2,200 pounds , which is close to an @entity64 ton			0
water is about 8.5 pounds per gallon , so one ton is about 260 gallons , " said @entity65 was , a professor of nuclear engineering at the @entity68			2
" so 11,500 tons is about 3 million gallons			0
a spent fuel pool holds around 300,000 gallons			0
so this amount of water is equivalent to the volume of roughly 10 ( spent fuel pools )			2
" it could take 50 hours to dump all the water , @entity29 said			2
the dumping of so much radioactive water into the ocean conjures up fears of mutated sea life and contamination of the human food chain , but experts said the radiation will be quickly diluted , minimizing risk			1
" to put this in perspective , the @entity6 holds about 300 trillion swimming pools full of water and they 're going to release about five swimming pools full of water			1
so hopefully the churning of the ocean and the currents will quickly disperse this so that it gets to very dilute concentrations relatively quickly , " said @entity93 , chair of the radiation safety committee at @entity95			2
" it 's a considerable amount of water , but the immensity of the @entity6 will quickly dilute this amount of water to harmless levels , " he added			1
@entity106 , president of @entity107 , similarly cited the vastness of the ocean in helping to minimize harm , and said he does not expect to see any permanent effects on marine life , even close in to the plant			2
however , he said officials should continue to monitor the radiation levels closely			0
" what we have to watch is how these materials accumulate in food products and then could be consumed by people , " @entity106 said			0
the build - up of water could cause problems around the nuclear facility , which is 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0 , @entity55 said monday			1
authorities have made a priority of dealing with water from the no. 2 unit , some of which has been gushing into the sea through a crack in a concrete shaft			2
" the radioactivity level is very high near the no. 2 reactor , and we know this			0
we have to stop the leak as early as possible to prevent this from going into the sea , " @entity55 said			0
" the radioactivity level is much less in the water from the @entity34 3 and 4 units			1
" @entity143 officials said monday night that the hope is that pumping out the no. 2 reactor turbine plant will lower the water level enough that contaminated liquid wo n't be able to reach the sea			2
" i am not able to say for certain whether or not this will be the last discharge , but we certainly would like to avoid releasing any such water into the sea as much as possible , " agency spokesman @entity148 said			2
officials were still awaiting test results to confirm the water pouring into the ocean is leaking from the highly radioactive no. 2 reactor			2
" we do n't know clearly , but we feel it is somehow leaking from @entity158 , " @entity148 said			0
even if the water is confirmed to have come from the reactor , neither @entity29 nor government officials know how it is making its way from the reactor to the leaking pit , he said			2
once the water is pumped out of the waste treatment reservoir , the agency believes it can safely transfer the water from the basement of the no. 2 turbine plant to the reservoir without further leaks , he said			1
though @entity3 officials say the water being discharged is less radioactive than the water now leaking into the sea , its top concentration of radioactive iodine - 131 is 20 becquerels per cubic centimeter , or 200,000 becquerels per kilogram			2
that 's 10 times the level of radioactivity permitted in food			2
but since it 's being dumped into the @entity6 , it will be quickly diluted , according to dr. @entity186 , a radiation oncologist at @entity189 's @entity188 and a @entity1 consultant			1
reactors no. 1 and no. 3 , which have lower levels of water , need to be drained as well			1
@entity29 's plan is to pump that water to other storage tanks , including some that still need to be set up			1
attempts to fill the 20 - centimeter ( 8 - inch ) crack outside the no. 2 reactor 's turbine building -- on saturday by pouring in concrete , then sunday by using a chemical compound mixed with sawdust and newspaper -- were not successful			2
as officials mull other ways to cut off the leak at its source , workers will install a silt fence along a damaged sea wall surrounding the plant , @entity148 said			0
the aim of this screening , usually used to halt erosion at construction sites , is to prohibit the spread of radioactive particles into the sea			0
workers also have injected a dye tracer into the water to allow them to track the dispersal of such particles , the spokesman added			0
addressing the issue quickly is critical because officials believe it is a source of alarmingly high radiation levels in seawater near the plant , as well as in nearby groundwater			0
complicating the situation is the fact that , in some cases , authorities do n't even know how much radiation is getting out			0
after some high - profile errors , little new information on water , ground and air radiation has been released since thursday			0
one reason is that the dosimeters being used do n't go above 1,000 millisieverts per hour , said @entity246 , an executive with @entity29			0
authorities know the water in the cracked concrete shaft is emitting at least that much radiation -- which equates , at a minimum , to more than 330 times the dose an average resident of an industrialized country naturally receives in a year			0
plugging the external leak is job one , in order to prevent the outflow of radiation into the @entity6			0
but it may not be the most difficult , or important , task ahead			0
authorities still have to figure out how the tainted water got into the concrete shaft in the first place			0
the water had to come from somewhere , potentially traveling across melted - down nuclear fuel in the reactor 's core before somehow reaching the outside			1
" we were assuming and hoping ( that water ) would stay in the containment vessel as vapor after being cooled , " @entity148 , the nuclear safety official , said sunday			1
" however , it may have flowed into the building , and then the trench			0
" determining why and how that happened -- and what to do about it -- may be " exceptionally challenging , " said physicist @entity282 , with the @entity284 - based @entity283 think tank			0
officials may have to inspect a complex array of pipes inside the dangerous radioactive environment inside the containment buildings			0
the state of the @entity34 5 and 6 units is another new problem			1
water in their turbine buildings ' basements threatens the power supply for the system used to cool nuclear material in these units ' spent fuel pools , @entity55 said			1
this makes it imperative to pump out that water , which will end up into the sea like that from around the @entity34 3 and 4 units			1
" though those reactors are stable at the moment , the growing water level in the turbine houses may disturb their stability , " he said			1
the effort to keep the @entity34 1 , 2 and 3 reactor cores and spent fuel pools cool took a step forward sunday , when the electricity source powering those three units ' cooling systems was switched from a temporary diesel generator to a more permanent , external power supply , according to the @entity323 's website			1
authorities hope this step , as well as preventing damage to the @entity34 5 and 6 units ' power supply , will help to minimize the prospect of any more radiation that might contaminate tap water or food			1
farmers have pushed for lower standards on radiation in food , calling them unnecessarily stringent			0
on monday , @entity55 said these limits would not change , even as he outlined a process in which sales restrictions on certain crops , in certain areas , would be lifted if they test safe three times in a row			0
@entity1 's @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 and @entity351 contributed to this report			0
