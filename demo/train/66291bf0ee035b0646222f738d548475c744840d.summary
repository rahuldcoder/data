a coroner ruled tuesday that a dingo , a wild dog native to @entity3 , caused the death of a baby more than 30 years ago			1
@entity6 was just 2 months old when she disappeared from a tent during a family holiday to @entity9 , also known as @entity9 , sparking one of the country 's most sensational and enduring murder mysteries			1
" the cause of her death was as the result of being attacked and taken by a dingo , " @entity13 , coroner for @entity14 , announced to @entity16 court early tuesday			2
" @entity22 can and do cause harm to humans			0
" the girl 's mother , @entity25 , long maintained that a dingo took her baby , even as she was sentenced to life in jail for her daughter 's murder , a conviction that was later quashed			1
during the trial , a witness recounted the then 32 - year - old mother 's cries of a " dingo 's got my baby , " which was immortalized in the 1988 film " @entity40 " starring @entity41 , who earned an @entity43 nomination for the role			1
outside the court tuesday , @entity25 - @entity46 said she and her family were " relieved and delighted to come to the end of this saga			1
" 2004 on @entity51 : child staves off stalking dingo " no longer will @entity3 be able to say that dingoes are not dangerous and will only attack if provoked , " she said			0
evidence produced at the fourth inquest into @entity59 's death in february included reports of attacks by dingoes and dogs assumed to be part - dingo or crossbreeds			2
the coroner heard that in 2001 a 9 - year - old boy died as a result of a dingo attack on @entity70 in the @entity3 state of @entity72			0
years later , two girls , each around two - years - old , died in separate attacks by dogs believed to be part - dingo in the states of @entity78 and @entity79			2
in her findings , @entity80 said no other disappearance exactly like that of @entity59 had been recorded			0
however , she said , " it is clear that there is evidence that in particular circumstances , a dingo is capable of attacking , taking and causing the death of young children			0
" it is a scenario that was unthinkable in 1980 when mother - of - three @entity25 , then married to @entity94 , sparked a frantic search of a remote campsite in central @entity3 after claiming that a dingo took her baby			1
so unbelievable was the idea that dingo would enter a tent to snatch a two - month - old that suspicion soon turned to the couple			2
the mystery was compounded by the lack of a body			0
@entity59 's was never found , although her heavily blood - stained singlet , jumpsuit and nappy were discovered near the campsite one week after she disappeared			2
overheard on @entity51 : ' shame it took so long ' for dingo ruling to be reached the first inquest into @entity59 's death in 1981 found that the baby died as a result of being taken by a dingo			1
however , the @entity118 quashed the finding later that year and ordered a second inquest into @entity59 's death			2
at the second inquest @entity25 was committed to trial for murder			1
her husband @entity124 was charged with being an accessory after the fact			0
the prosecution alleged that @entity25 slit her daughter 's throat with a pair of scissors before hiding her body , possibly in a camera bag , before she and her husband @entity124 buried her somewhere in the vicinity of the campsite			1
the 35 - day trial created a media frenzy in @entity3 as commentators picked apart the intricacies of the case , while a fascinated public speculated wildly as to how and why @entity59 had died			0
the jury returned its verdict in 1982 ; @entity25 was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in jail			1
her husband @entity124 was given a suspended sentence			0
@entity25 served four years of her sentence before the @entity14 government ordered her release in 1986 after the discovery of new evidence ; a baby 's jacket , believed to be @entity59 's , found half - buried near a dingo lair at @entity9			1
in 1988 , a @entity156 set up to review the evidence formally quashed convictions for both husband and wife			0
despite the finding that the couple was not to blame , a third inquest into their daughter 's death returned an open verdict in 1995			0
it was that verdict that the couple sought to overturn with a fourth inquest this year .			0

@entity6 disappeared from a tent more than 30 years ago
