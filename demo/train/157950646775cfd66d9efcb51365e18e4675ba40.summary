the @entity0 is arguably the world 's toughest event -- but it 's just got a whole lot tougher			1
one of the few sporting occasions where fans do n't pay to watch its stars , one of the @entity0 's charms has been allowing its followers to get up close and personal			1
you are literally in touching distance of your heroes			2
that 's especially true on the arduous climbs in the @entity15 and the @entity16 where hundreds of thousands of cycling fanatics line the roads			2
but the tour 's three - day visit to @entity21 has raised a new potential obstacle for the cycling 's elite riders -- the selfie			1
as an estimated million people lined the narrow roads between @entity28 and @entity29 , the near 200 - strong peloton were taking extra care to avoid spectators taking the social media craze just a little too far			1
official estimates put the number of fans who watched @entity37 in @entity38 over two days at 2.5 million , with @entity0 organizers claiming it was close to double			1
but with most armed with mobile phone cameras , the dangers of individuals taking a shot of themselves but forgetting cyclists were powering past at 45kph per hour only inches away was all too apparent			2
@entity47 star @entity46 marveled at the fans supporting him as a home rider , but said the selfish selfie takers were " a giant pain in the arse			2
" @entity54 rider @entity53 went further and went on @entity55 to send out a warning			0
" a dangerous mix of vanity and stupidity			0
" @entity60 with you back turned while 200 cyclists come at you , just to take a selfie			0
@entity65 , " he moaned			0
monday 's stage saw one of @entity46 ' teammates , @entity67 , brush shoulders with a fan who was not paying attention , fortunately without serious injury to either party			2
despite being a work day , the crowds were again immense , particularly in the many small towns and villages on the route and in central @entity29 with massive fan parks in @entity80 and @entity81			1
two years ago sports mad @entity21 was gripped by @entity84 fever , now it was being replicated as the world 's greatest cycling race sped past			1
at the @entity88 at @entity89 in @entity29 the crowd grew rapidly as many people took an extended lunch hour to reserve their own viewing point			1
once again most were carrying mobiles or tablet devices but there were no worries about selfies here as the roads around the @entity99 were barriered -- with stewards taking their responsibilities seriously			2
@entity102 from @entity103 had been one of the much lauded @entity104 at the @entity105 , and was using his skills again as an official @entity107 to usher the crowds to their vantage points and keep their spirits up			0
" it 's the first time i 've been to the @entity0 and i 'm very excited , " he told @entity111			1
@entity113 , from @entity114 , said it the experience had evoked memories of 2012			0
" it 's very nostalgic for a lot of us and it is great to be back , " she said			0
not all the fans were @entity21 , @entity127 , from @entity128 , was on holiday and as an avid cycling fan was determined to watch the @entity0 , " it is such a great atmosphere , " he said			1
but most at the side of the roadside had little knowledge of professional cycling			0
local resident @entity135 had taken her children and grandchildren to watch			0
" you 've got to support them , " she said while professing she had never heard of @entity21 's great cycling hero @entity138			1
so sure enough as first the breakaway duo of @entity144 @entity143 and @entity145 of the @entity146 came flying past , with thousand of cameras capturing the moment , @entity135 and her family cheered them to an echo			0
about a minute later the main bunch muscled past -- already closing fast on the doomed escapees			0
the whole action had taken probably less than two minutes , after which the crowd slowly dispersed , with many them gathering around one of the big tv screens which had been put in place for the @entity105			0
they saw @entity143 and @entity145 caught after their heroic 150km effort , sportingly applauding at the moment of the catch			0
a few minutes later another burst of applause as @entity169 's @entity168 powered up the @entity170 in front of @entity172 to win his second stage of this year 's tour with @entity176 's @entity175 holding on to the race leader 's yellow jersey			1
it did not appear to matter to the crowd that @entity21 's great sprinting her @entity181 , winner of 25 @entity0 stages , was absent after crashing out of the race saturday			1
@entity185 , who hails from @entity186 , had watched the action on all three days , including at @entity188 , home of @entity190 sisters , who penned a series of literary masterpieces			0
" on the climbs the atmosphere was absolutely fantastic , " he said			0
" there 's been an explosion of interest which started with the exploits of @entity199 , " he added			0
@entity199 won six gold medals at the @entity105 in the track sprint events , a far cry from the 3,664km which make up the three - week @entity0 this year			1
but his exploits and that of @entity206 , who won the @entity207 and @entity181 , raised the profile of cycling in @entity21 to new heights			1
@entity168 , who won last year 's iconic final stage on the @entity212 in @entity213 , said the atmosphere on the @entity170 had come " pretty close " to that			1
" i 'm pretty sad that we 'll finish only once here because it 's a great atmosphere by the side of the road			0
it was one of the greatest finishes i 've ever seen because of this great scenery , " he added			2
the @entity0 will now move to @entity144 for the remaining 18 stages and it remains to be seen if in its traditional home the crowds seen in @entity226 can be matched			1
if also remains to be seen if the selfie craze spreads across the channel to pose a threat to the peloton , who have enough to cope with on those punishing climbs of the @entity16 and @entity15			0
defending champion @entity234 of @entity47 will now carry the hopes of the ever - growing band of cycling aficionados from @entity21 , well placed just two seconds behind @entity175 .			2

millions line *streets* of @entity21 again for @entity0
