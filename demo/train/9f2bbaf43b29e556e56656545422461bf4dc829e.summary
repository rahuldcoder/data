@entity0 -- the year is 1962 and at @entity2 in @entity0 the lad who will become @entity4 is about to announce his musical intentions			1
read review of @entity4 's new album as the line of schoolboys shuffles into the makeshift careers office , the boy steps forward			1
his friend @entity12 takes up the story			2
" i was right behind @entity4 and the careers officer said ' so mr. @entity4 , what is it you are planning to do when you leave school ? ' and @entity4 said , ' well i wan na be a saxophonist in a modern jazz quartet ! ' i laughed my head off after that because they did n't know how to pigeon hole people and they went down the category of music careers and he said ' i 've got an interview for a job at a harp factory in @entity30 ' -- that 's the nearest thing they had to music which i thought was hilarious			1
" music had already brought the two boys together as friends through a common interest in skiffle ( " the punk music of its time " offers @entity12 ) and membership of a church choir			1
their vocal harmonies continued at school , singing @entity44 and @entity46 songs in the reverb - rich stairwell outside the art block , encouraged by their charismatic art master , @entity49			1
why we 're just glad to have @entity4 back @entity49 's son @entity52 joined the school three years after @entity12 and @entity4 and was soon in search of musical companions			1
" i asked my father who was head of the art department at the school , who was into music , " says @entity49 , " and he said well there 's this @entity4 character -- he seems to play guitar and sax			1
" " so it was the three of us exchanging licks really -- they taught me @entity46 numbers and i showed them what i knew on guitar -- so that 's when our friendship started on those stone steps			2
" @entity12 and @entity4 formed a firm friendship , which led to an uncanny coincidence			1
" @entity4 's mother and my mother -- who did n't know each other -- were both knitting jumpers for us and lo and behold it was the same pattern and we were walking down @entity79 with the same jumpers like we were trying to pull birds ! " @entity4 's fondness for @entity84 radio led to an interest in american football results			1
" no one at that time was into @entity88 in those days			0
but @entity4 liked the image of the big shoulder pads and there was a certain glamor about the way they looked and he thought i 'll get into @entity88			2
" when @entity4 wrote to the @entity96 in @entity0 about his enthusiasm the two boys were invited to visit and try on the equipment , the shoulder pads seeming like an inspiration for the wardrobe of the future @entity101			2
but even best friends can have disagreements -- particularly when they are teenage boys trying to date the same girl			0
" i managed to chat her up and arranged to meet her a couple of days later in this club			0
and @entity4 was rather annoyed and said , ' actually @entity108 does n't want to go out with you she wants to go out with me and she did n't have the heart to tell you			2
' " @entity12 says @entity4 convinced him that the girl would n't turn up for the meeting			1
" i was upset but i decided to go down to the club an hour and a half later and her mate said she had waited for me for an hour and @entity4 had made me look like a right prat			2
" next day @entity12 could n't contain himself when he heard @entity4 saying he had won @entity12 's girl			1
" i just saw red and i do n't go around hitting people i promise you that -- honest -- i was n't that type			0
i knew @entity4 would n't fight me and i was so annoyed i just went like that			2
" ( he makes a punching gesture )			0
@entity123 takes up the story			0
" i remember the day because my father came home very agitated and told the story of one of his pupils hit the other one and there was a fight or something and i heard that @entity4 had to be taken to hospital but that 's all i knew i did n't actually see it happen			1
but the unfortunate thing is that as well as teaching art my dad also taught boxing and @entity12 was in his class so i think my father felt rather responsible ! " the incident left @entity4 with a frozen pupil , giving the effect that he has eyes of different colors , which contributed to the other - worldly look which became synonymous with the image of @entity4			1
" oh @entity150 my stomach was turning , " says @entity12			0
" that was the last thing i wanted			0
but anyway we made up and years later he told me i did him a favor so i do n't feel so bad about it now ! " all three boys dreamed of becoming pop stars			0
@entity12 and @entity4 played together in bands such as the kon - rads and @entity160 but it was @entity12 who scored the first hit recording under the name @entity165			1
@entity52 left school early at 16 to join hit - making bands @entity169 and @entity168			0
that 's when @entity4 -- now performing as @entity4 -- took his first big step towards stardom			2
" when we were on the roads together @entity4 's first single ' @entity175 ' went to number 1 " says @entity49			1
" he was number 1 in @entity178 and @entity168 we were number 2 with ' @entity180			0
' " the @entity182 alumni had arrived			0
@entity12 quit music to focus on art and @entity4 asked him to work on three of his most famous album covers -- " @entity4 , " " @entity187 " and " @entity101			1
" he was invited along on the " @entity101 " tour to @entity84 , crossing the @entity189 on the @entity191 liner , where @entity4 astonished other diners by turning up for dinner in full @entity101 costume			0
@entity12 recalls the reaction of the fans on that pivotal tour			0
" the audience were just standing with their mouths open looking at him thinking , ' what am i seeing here ? ' it was interesting seeing that from the ground floor every night			0
" after achieving huge success as a solo artist -- " @entity207 " remains one of the best - selling live albums in music history -- @entity123 suffered a series of setbacks which left his career in tatters , until @entity4 invited him to record and tour with him in the 1980s			1
" i ca n't thank him enough for asking me			0
there are so many other people he could have asked			0
but he was very aware of what had happened to me as far as my musical credibility disappearing because of the pop icon deal that happened to me			0
it was very special of him to see that and take me back to places that i could n't fill any more ... those kind of venues and take me around the world and reintroduce me as the guitar player and i still owe him			0
" @entity52 went on to win a @entity225 for his 2006 album " @entity227 " while @entity12 has developed a career in painting which has included exhibitions at @entity0 's prestigious @entity231			1
all three remain firm friends today and plan to download the new album			2
@entity12 says he was n't concerned about @entity4 's 10 - year absence from recording			1
" i 'm sure he 'd let me know if there was anything wrong			0
there 's all this speculation about his health but do n't worry folks , he 's fine -- the album proves it does n't it ? " " a lot of people have copied what he has done , in terms of re-inventing himself all the time , just when you think he 's got him figured out , " says @entity49			1
" he 's an actor , he 's a musician , he 's an artist and he puts them all together and does what he wishes when he wishes and he 's very confident about what he does			0
but he 's the same guy i went to school with			2

@entity123 and @entity12 recall their long friendship with @entity4
@entity4 's new album , " @entity261 " was released on march 8
all three friends played in school bands with bands , and remain friends
@entity49 , says @entity4 is healthy : " he 's the same guy i went to school with "
