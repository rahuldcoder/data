editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			0
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- there have been several points in my career as a producer and camera operator where i 've realized that i have one of the best jobs in the world			0
this usually occurs to me in remote and interesting places like @entity29 or @entity30 or something			0
i 'd been on the @entity32 , @entity33 , set of " @entity34 " for about two hours , watching two gigantic cranes catapult a @entity36 containing star @entity37 and gallons of fecal matter 10 stories in the air when the feeling struck me again			0
admittedly , i 'm a longtime fan of the " @entity47 " franchise , which was born out of an article for @entity46 magazine in 1999			1
a friend showed me a clip of @entity50 getting shocked with a stun gun while hoisting an @entity53 flag , and i 've been on board ever since			1
when i heard about the 3 - d project , i have to admit i was worried			1
i was concerned that the @entity47 concept was old and tired , and its stars -- @entity50 , @entity37 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , and @entity61 -- had run out of ideas			1
with nothing left in their creative arsenal , they wandered out of " @entity67 " one afternoon and decided that they would jump on the @entity70 bandwagon to cash in one last time			0
however , a few days on set showed me those concerns were unfounded			0
the @entity74 was alive and well , and the addition of a third dimension only enhanced the jaw - dropping inexplicable hilarity of the crew 's antics			1
see the rest of @entity81 and @entity82 at @entity9 by mid-morning of my first day onset , @entity37 had been launched hundreds of feet in the air and the crew -- along with maybe $ 1 million worth of @entity70 camera equipment -- had been coated with a fine spray of human and animal waste			1
director @entity90 was screaming at a gagging camera operator to get b - roll shots of the poop - slicked interior of the @entity36 that @entity37 had been strapped in moments before			2
despite the smell and intermittent bouts of vomiting by the crew , i could tell that everyone on set knew they 'd created something special			2
i went from having the feeling that i had one the best jobs in the world to being pretty sure the cast and crew from @entity47 had it all figured out .			1

using just *handheld* video cameras , " @entity47 " franchise had humble , low - tech beginning
@entity50 and core *group* of cast and crew has been together since the start
*technology* required to produce 3 - d film meant *embracing* new equipment , crew *members*
