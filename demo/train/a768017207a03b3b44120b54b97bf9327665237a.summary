after years of thinking it over , @entity0 finally had a plan			1
he 'd bought a gun and learned how to use it			0
he 'd loaded three magazines			0
and he had stopped by @entity6 to pick up 15 sandwiches , which he planned to smear in the dying faces of staffers he expected to kill at the @entity11 in @entity12			1
it would be a statement , he said , " against the people who work in that building , " according to documents filed in @entity16 , where @entity0 pleaded guilty on wednesday to three charges related to the august shooting at the conservative policy group			1
@entity0 told judge @entity22 that he hoped to intimidate gay rights opponents			1
the shooting came amid intense debate over remarks against gay marriage by an executive with the @entity29 - based @entity28 and the company 's support for groups considered hostile to gay rights			1
the research council , a @entity36 group that focuses on family , anti-abortion and religious liberty issues and views homosexuality as harmful , backed @entity6 in the ensuing controversy			0
" they endorse @entity6 and also @entity6 came out against gay marriage , so i was going to use that as a statement , " prosecutors quoted @entity0 as telling investigators			1
@entity0 , 28 , pleaded guilty to committing an act of terrorism while armed , interstate transportation of a firearm and ammunition , and assault with intent to kill while armed			1
prosecutors dropped seven other charges			0
the charges carry sentences of up to 70 years in prison			1
however , the sentence could be shorter because @entity0 has no prior criminal record			2
@entity61 will be sentenced april 29 , prosecutors said			1
the act of terrorism charge alleges that @entity0 wanted to kill building manager @entity64 and other @entity11 employees " with the intent to intimidate and coerce a significant portion of the civilian population of the @entity12 and the @entity69			1
" it is a @entity12 law passed in 2002 but never before used			0
according to prosecutors ' account of the attack filed on wednesday , @entity0 got into the @entity11 's building by telling @entity64 that he was there to interview for an internship			1
after @entity64 asked for identification , prosecutors say , @entity0 reached into his backpack , retrieved a handgun and leveled it at @entity64 's head			2
@entity64 ducked and lunged at @entity84 before he could fire a shot , according to prosecutors			0
as the two struggled , @entity0 fired three times , hitting @entity64 once in the arm , before the building manager was able to wrestle him to the ground , disarm him and hold him at gunpoint until police arrived			1
as he lay on the ground , @entity0 said something to the effect , " ' it 's not about you			2
' it 's about the @entity11 and its policies , " according to the prosecution account			2
@entity61 -- who had chosen the research council as his target after finding it listed as an anti-gay group on the website of the @entity107 -- had planned to stride into the building and open fire on the people inside in an effort to kill as many as possible , he told investigators , according to the court documents			1
if he 'd been successful and escaped , his plan was to go to another conservative group to continue the attack , prosecutors said			0
a handwritten list naming three other groups he planned to attack was found among his belongings , prosecutors said			0
according to the documents , @entity0 had thought about such an attack for years but " just never went through with it			1
" he purchased the gun used in the attack a week before at a @entity129 gun store , where a @entity131 television crew taped him while doing a story about the widespread availability of guns in @entity69 , according to prosecutors			0
he also went to the store the day before the attack for two hours of training			0
@entity69 attorney @entity139 said @entity84 ' guilty plea " makes clear that using violence to terrorize political opponents will not be tolerated			2
" at the time of the shooting , @entity0 lived with his parents in @entity146 , @entity129 , and volunteered at a @entity12 center for the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community			2
in august , @entity152 investigators said in an affidavit that investigators had interviewed @entity0 ' parents after the shooting , and they said their son " has strong opinions with respect to those he believes do not treat homosexuals in a fair manner			2
" the @entity107 has listed the @entity11 as a hate group since 2010 , pointing to what it describes as its anti-gay propaganda and legislative agenda			1
on his nightly radio show on wednesday , @entity11 president @entity167 mentioned the plea deal and accused the @entity107 of playing a role in the shooting by inciting hatred and violence rather than fighting it -- a claim he has repeatedly made since the shooting			1
" the @entity107 is dangerous			2
they are inciting hatred , and in this case a clear connection to violence , " he said on the radio broadcast			0
" they need to be held accountable , and they need to be stopped before people are killed because of their reckless labeling and advocacy for homosexuality and their anti-christian stance			0
" a spokeswoman for the center declined to comment on the plea deal or the research council 's comments , but referred to a statement from the organization last year , standing by its designation of the @entity11 as a " hate group			0
" " as people who care about human dignity , we have a moral obligation to call out the @entity11 for its demonizing lies and incendiary rhetoric about the @entity202 community , " the statement said			0
" the fact that we list the @entity11 as a hate group because of its demonizing propaganda does not make us the hateful one			0
spreading demonizing lies is what is dangerous , not exposing them			0

the president of the @entity11 accuses the @entity107 of " inciting violence "
@entity0 , pleads guilty , says he wanted to intimidate those who oppose gay rights
he faces up to 70 years in prison when sentenced april 29
