-- @entity1 is stirring the pot , suggesting she might seek office again			1
" i 've considered it because people have requested me to consider it			0
but , i 'm still waiting to see what the lineup will be and hoping that -- there again , there will be some new blood , new energy , " she told radio host @entity7 on tuesday			0
no , she 's not thinking about the 2016 presidential race -- yet			0
this time , she 's eyeing next year 's @entity17 race in @entity18 , where @entity20 @entity19 is seeking a second term			1
@entity19 : @entity18 do n't like quitters several republicans have already announced their intentions to run , including @entity25 , who ran a spirited but unsuccessful race for @entity17 in 2010 , and lt. gov. @entity27			1
both have been in touch with the @entity30 in @entity31 to discuss their bids			0
@entity1 and her advisers have not			2
in fact , @entity35 sources say that members of @entity1 's team have insinuated that the former governor may be willing to support a candidate already in the race			1
of course , @entity1 has made bashing the @entity35 establishment into a blood sport and likely would n't seek @entity31 - based help , anyway			1
@entity1 to @entity35 establishment : ' you disrespect @entity47 ' " most republicans would realize running against @entity1 in a primary is like running into a buzz saw			1
she 's got a financial advantage and a grassroots advantage that would be very tough to compete with , " @entity52 's @entity51 adds			0
but there are reasons to doubt she 's serious about a run			0
for one thing , the @entity35 right urged her to wage a primary challenge against sen. @entity60 in 2010 , but she opted against it			1
she also resigned @entity18 's governorship in 2009 before completing a full term			2
" notice , this is not hiring staff , this is not any of the things that a real run would involve			0
this is just kind of an idle comment to @entity7 , " @entity69 says of @entity1 's recent actions			1
@entity1 is also not doing any of the things she did to grab headlines like when she was considering a presidential run two years ago , like publicizing slickly produced campaign - style videos and launching a whirlwind cross-country bus tour			2
in october 2011 , she finally explained that she had decided against a national run because , " i 've concluded that i believe i can be an effective voice in a real decisive role in helping get true public servants elected to office			0
" and now as she flirts with a @entity17 run , she has to deal with a new reality : her popularity in @entity18 has tumbled			1
several private polls obtained from @entity35 sources indicate she 's one of the least - liked politicians in the state			2
what 's more , @entity1 is raking in the bucks giving high - profile speeches at conservative functions and appearing on @entity94			2
and her family is starring in various reality shows			0
as a @entity99 senator , those paychecks would disappear			0
yet , @entity1 loves nothing more than to stay relevant			0
" my goal right now is to keep people inspired and empowered , " she told @entity0 in june			0
@entity1 embraces @entity104 sketch , dishes out her own humor what she may be toying with is the uncomfortable concept that she 's not the @entity35 's only bright young star anymore			1
these days , there are plenty of energetic conservatives capturing the party 's imagination that may make her fight for newsy buzz , like sen. @entity117 of @entity118 , sen. @entity119 of @entity120 , gov. @entity121 of @entity122 , sen. @entity123 of @entity124 and sen. @entity125 of @entity126 , among others			2
" if she runs , it 's going to instantly become the most covered , the most scrutinized , the most hotly debated @entity17 race of the 2014 cycle , " @entity69 said			1
@entity132 chairman @entity131 said @entity35 have a 50 - 50 chance of taking the majority back in the @entity17 in next year 's midterm elections , and said it 's an even more significant possibility if @entity1 runs for the @entity18 seat			1
" if she runs , all the odds are off the table , " he said			0
" she would win a general election			0
" but what about the growing chorus of @entity35 who say they would rather see her leave the party than create any new buzz ? " the benefits of having her as a @entity99 senator and helping us get back the majority so far outweigh any distractions that might be caused , " @entity131 said			2
he added that there are a number of young , outspoken republicans in the @entity17 who help the @entity35 spread its message and " she will be one more such member			1
" and until she decides , political watchers should buckle up , because she 'll get plenty of attention			0
@entity1 has until june 2 , 2014 , to file paperwork to run .			1

former @entity35 *vp* nominee @entity1 is considering a run for @entity17 in 2014
*observer* : running against @entity1 in a primary is " like running into a buzz saw "
