@entity1 , @entity0 -- there is a mathematical reason why the @entity5 is so different to any other of the @entity8 tennis tournaments			2
clay courts require a different type of game to grass and hard court surfaces the @entity5 tournament is currently being contested , with @entity16 looking for his fifth win in a row , and world number two @entity19 searching for his first ever @entity5 title			1
get the latest @entity5 news what has brought problems to @entity19 , and to other greats like @entity26 and @entity27 -- who never won a @entity5 , is the clay surface on which it is contested			2
the maths of the clay surface are distinctly different to grass or hard - court surfaces			1
all officially recognized courts have a court pace rating ( @entity36 ) , which rates the " speed " of the court -- and clay courts are at the bottom			1
the crushed - brick mixture that constitutes the base of a clay court produces a the highest bounce and most friction of the three surfaces , meaning they have the lowest cpr of all three surface types and are considered as the " slowest "			1
grass courts are generally have the highest cpr numbers , and are the " fastest " courts			2
the @entity36 numbers give a hint as to whether a ball will bounce higher or lower on a specific surface , and how much friction there is to either slow the ball or allow it to skid on			2
an example court pace rating for each surface may be 23 for a clay court , 35 for a hard court and 46 for a grass court			1
try our special interactive to see how tennis ball bounce on different surfaces Â» this number is calculated by considering both horizontal speed and vertical bounce of a tennis ball off a court			1
the equation used is @entity36 = @entity75 + 150 x ( 0.81 - e )			0
to make more sense of this , the @entity76 , the game 's law - makers , have produced a chart which simply matches the coefficient of friction ( friction ) and coefficient of restitution ( bounce ) to produce a court pace rating			1
but it 's not just the bounce and speed of the ball off the clay surface that sets it apart from other courts , and makes the @entity5 an elusive tournament for some players			1
head of women 's tennis at @entity98 's @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , @entity99 , told @entity2 the slippery nature of the clay surface also set it apart from other types of court			1
" the main factor that makes it different is that it 's a loose surface			2
that allows players to slide on it			0
" the loose surface and different clay characteristics meant the crushed - brick surface required a different game plan , he said			2
" players are a lot further back on the clay surface			0
if you look at @entity16 , his return of service points of contact are different to other surfaces ... on clay he can sit back			0
" the slower pace and higher bounce also meant big servers like @entity26 were negated on clay and certain types of players were better suited to it , @entity99 said			0
so the slice is effective on clay ... and you can also produce a lot of top spin			0
one of the problems @entity19 has on clay is that he has a single - handed backhand , and @entity16 can get so much spin -- so @entity19 is trying to hit single - handed shots up around his shoulder			0
" the clay approach was slightly different in women 's tennis , however , as some players tended to approach clay matches similar to hard - court games , he said			1
@entity146 said endurance was also a crucial advantage on clay , particularly at @entity5			0
" you tend to have longer rallies on clay			0
the @entity5 is so physical with five - set matches			0
when somebody faces @entity16 to five sets no - one can compete with him physically , " he said .			0

@entity130 , grass and hard tennis court surfaces all produce different bounces
the speed and bounce of certain courts can *adversely* *affect* a player 's game
