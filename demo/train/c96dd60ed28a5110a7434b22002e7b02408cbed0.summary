-- an @entity2 couple hopes to return to the @entity2 next week to be reunited with their family after a two - year legal nightmare has trapped them in @entity7 , charged with wrongdoing in the death of their adopted daughter			1
on monday @entity12 and @entity13 will appeal their conviction , which has garnered international attention and raised questions in the media about the prosecution and overall fairness of the @entity7 justice system			1
" it has been a very confusing and almost incomprehensible process to us , " @entity13 said in a phone interview from @entity7			1
we just want to go home			2
" when their 8 - year - old daughter @entity27 died in january 2013 , the couple was immediately arrested on charges they starved her to death			1
" it was a shock , " @entity13 said			1
" she is our daughter			2
" the @entity32 , who maintained their daughter suffered from an eating disorder , have denied wrongdoing in connection with her death and are fighting the conviction			2
@entity40 was employed in @entity41 by an international company working on construction projects for the @entity44			2
after a lengthy trial , the @entity45 were convicted of endangering the life of their child			2
they were sentenced in april to three years in prison			0
the @entity50 has expressed concern about the fairness of the legal proceedings in the case and disappointment in the verdict			0
a @entity58 video made about the case by advocates for the @entity61 portrays a happy multiracial family , provides insights into @entity27 's death and raises questions about the prosecution			0
in the video , @entity67 , director of the @entity68 , one of the advocacy groups assisting with the @entity61 ' defense , says " the case completely lacks any type of due process			0
" he calls the @entity7 prosecution 's case " outrageous			1
" the @entity2 has suggested that cultural misunderstandings were at the heart of the charges , that evidence provided by the defense was not carefully considered and due process for the @entity61 has not been provided			0
a report by pathologists hired by the defense , obtained by @entity0 , states they found no evidence tissue samples were taken from @entity27 's body after her death , despite the fact @entity7 investigators submitted an autopsy report			1
advocates for the @entity61 suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the @entity7 judiciary for a formal investigation has gone unanswered			1
" there is no credible evidence , " said @entity96 , who heads the firm @entity97 that is also assisting with the @entity45 ' case			0
" in an objective court the judge should have thrown out the case			0
" several @entity2 officials have privately expressed confidence in the @entity61 ' innocence , calling the case a " sham			0
" but the @entity109 administration has sought to exhaust all legal proceedings before seeking the @entity7 government 's direct intervention in the case			1
a @entity115 special rapporteur investigating the justice system in @entity7 has also called attention to the @entity45 ' case and urged the government to release them and send them home			1
after spending nearly a year in prison , the couple was released last november			2
they are prohibited from leaving @entity7 during their appeal			1
the case suggested racial overtones when questions were raised by the prosecutor and police about why the @entity45 , who are @entity129 , adopted children from @entity131			0
the @entity7 prosecutor has sought to paint @entity13 and @entity40 as inhumane , alleging they bought their adopted daughter cheaply from her poverty - stricken parents in @entity131 and has since threatened to seek human trafficking charges			1
the couple 's two sons , also adopted from @entity131 , were temporarily placed in a @entity7 orphanage after the couple 's arrest , but have since been sent back to the @entity2 to live with @entity13 's mother			1
the entire family has chipped in during the prolonged separation			0
with @entity40 fired from his job , the couple is living on donations from family and friends			2
@entity13 's brother , @entity150 , has given up his job in @entity151 to work on the case full time			1
he is the nerve center of the family , raising money for the family 's expenses and defense costs and dealing with the @entity45 ' lawyers and advocates			0
@entity150 has met with lawmakers and administration officials in @entity164 , urging them to make the @entity45 ' case a greater priority			0
he has weekly @entity168 chats with his sister and has traveled several times to @entity41 for their judicial proceedings , which the @entity7 court continues to postpone			1
" often it 's hard to keep working on something when it feels we are just a small family trying to fight against " a country , he said in a phone interview , before leaving friday for @entity7 for the @entity61 ' appellate hearing			1
the case puts the @entity2 in a difficult situation with a close ally with whom it is working on hot - button issues in the @entity187			0
@entity7 is a key ally in the @entity2 - led coalition against @entity190 and host to many countries ' forces involved in airstrikes			1
the @entity7 government also helped the @entity2 secure the release of sgt. @entity197 from @entity199 captivity this year			1
" @entity7 is a key ally for the @entity2 government , " @entity96 says			1
" the day the @entity45 were wrongly convicted the @entity2 announced an $ 11 billion arms deal with the @entity7			1
and when @entity197 was released , president @entity109 publicly thanked the government			2
that all sends a message not only to @entity7 but to other countries that there is no cost to @entity2 being wrongly imprisoned in their country			1
" @entity96 noted the @entity2 has upped the pressure on the @entity7 government in recent months to resolve the case quickly and release the @entity45			1
last week the @entity50 issued a statement urging the @entity7 government to " immediately " lift the @entity61 ' travel ban , bring the case to an " expeditious and just conclusion " and allow the couple to return to the @entity2			1
" we are really hopeful that as a result of the @entity50 making this public demand that the @entity7 lift the travel ban , that there is a good chance that @entity223 and @entity13 can come home , " @entity96 says			1
her parents and other family members describe @entity27 as a happy child , who loved butterflies , flowers and the color pink			0
" she loved to talk , to dance and she loved music , " @entity13 said			1
" she loved hearing stories			0
" but consumed with their nightmare in isolation , the @entity61 and their family have not had a chance to grieve for their daughter			2
" everything has revolved around her case and our situation , " @entity13 said			2
" we have n't had a chance to really say goodbye and mourn			0
we just really want to be able to honor her place in our lives with our friends and family and that has n't happened yet			0
" " nobody in the family has had time to grieve about @entity27 and her death and the fact she passed away , " @entity150 said			0
" especially @entity223 and @entity13			2
to see my nephews without their parents , who have not been able to hold them for the past year			0
" the couple is fearful to go out in public , spending most of their time in their @entity41 apartment			0
with a 10 - hour time difference , they spend every hour they and their two sons , 8 and 12 , are all awake on @entity168 , talking and going over homework			0
the technology has been a godsend , but virtual parenting is n't easy			0
the kids have stored away last year 's @entity275 gifts until the family can celebrate together			0
" we are trying to be as involved as we can be , but we are really tired of trying to do it over the @entity278 , " @entity13 said			2
" we have missed birthdays , anniversaries and so many special events			0
we are longing to be home with our family again			0
" " we are encouraged that they are urging the @entity7 government to lift our travel ban and are hopeful everyone here would respond to that request and allow us to travel home to be reunited with our family			2
but of course , we are not home			0

@entity12 and @entity13 were living in @entity7 when their daughter died
