dozens of people have been killed and thousands of homes burned to the ground in @entity5 's volatile @entity4 in recent days , amid an upsurge in violence between @entity8 and @entity10 muslims that prompted the government to declare a state of emergency			1
@entity13 looks at the background to the ongoing communal violence in the @entity17 country			2
what 's behind the unrest ? overnight curfews in several towns and villages across the region have been in place since may , when the arrest of three @entity27 men suspected of raping and killing a @entity30 woman sparked deadly clashes between the @entity10 and @entity8			1
two of the men have since been sentenced to death , while the third hanged himself while in detention , the government - run newspaper @entity36 of @entity5 reported on its website			2
the following month , 10 muslims were killed when several hundred people attacked a bus in the state 's @entity44 district , reportedly believing some of the passengers were involved in the murder			1
the violence then spread across the northern part of the state , resulting in the destruction of thousands of homes and the deaths of almost 100 people , according to the government			1
a state of emergency in @entity4 was declared , with the military deployed to help restore order			1
the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) in @entity5 estimates that around 75,000 @entity10 have been displaced by the unrest			2
the simmering tensions between the two ethnic groups erupted again this week in several towns across the state , despite the curfew , with reports that at least 50 people had died and hundreds of homes burned to the ground , according to state officials			1
opinion : @entity72 and the power of unity who are the @entity10 ? the @entity10 are a stateless @entity27 minority living in @entity4 -- thought to number between 800,000 and one million -- who claim they were persecuted by @entity5 's military during its decades of authoritarian rule			1
@entity5 does not recognize them as citizens or one of the 135 recognized ethnic groups living in the country			2
much of this is rooted in their heritage in @entity88 , now called @entity89			0
though many @entity10 have only known life in @entity5 , they are viewed by @entity92 's estimated three million @entity8 as intruders from across the border			2
according to @entity97 , the country 's laws discriminate against the @entity10 , infringing on their rights to freedom of movement , education , and employment			0
they are denied land and property rights and ownership			0
the land on which they live can be taken away at any given time			0
@entity97 has also accused security forces of opening fire on the @entity10 population during the recent wave of violence -- an accusation denied by the government			2
what are the authorities doing ? in august , @entity5 's president , @entity118 , announced that an internal commission , including representatives from different political parties and religious organizations , had been formed to investigate the recent sectarian violence -- a move welcomed by @entity126 secretary - general ban ki - moon			1
" this commission is comprised of a representative cross-section of national figures in the country , " @entity127 said in a statement			0
" it could make important contributions to restoring peace and harmony in the state and in creating a conducive environment for a more inclusive way forward to tackle the underlying causes of the violence , including the condition of the @entity27 communities in @entity4			1
" president @entity118 discussed the situation with @entity127 during the @entity144 in @entity145 in september , pledging to " address the root causes of the tensions , " according to a @entity126 spokesman			1
the move followed @entity118 's warning in june that the ongoing ethnic strife could harm @entity5 's development and stability as it continues its rehabilitation as a fledgling democracy			1
what is the world saying ? @entity158 , the @entity126 's human rights rapporteur for @entity5 , in august called for an independent investigation into allegations that authorities are using excessive force and committing other human rights violations while trying to restore order in @entity4			1
@entity158 said such an investigation was needed to guarantee accountability			0
" reconciliation will not be possible without this , and exaggerations and distortions will fill the vacuum to further fuel distrust and tensions between communities , " he said			0
thousands of @entity10 have attempted to flee the unrest , with neighboring @entity89 the main destination			0
but many have been turned away by the authorities			0
@entity89 has reinforced its border , amassing troops and security officials along the @entity183 , which provides a natural boundary between the two countries , where rickety fishing boats filled with refugees attempt to cross over			0
in june , @entity89 foreign minister @entity188 said her country was not willing to give shelter to anymore refugees , despite international calls to open its borders			0
" we 're already burdened with thousands of @entity10 refugees staying in @entity89 and we do n't want anymore , " she said			0
@entity97 says tens of thousands of @entity10 refugees are currently staying in makeshift camps in @entity89 , with many living in conditions that seasoned aid workers have described as " the worst they have ever seen			2
" according to the rights group , the inhabitants face overcrowding , shortages of food leading to widespread malnourishment among the children , a lack of clean water and sanitation resulting in disease , and restrictions on movement coupled with extortion and human rights abuses .			0
