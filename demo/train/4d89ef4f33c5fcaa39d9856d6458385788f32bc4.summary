-- my journey of faith began at age 11 when i began to study the @entity5 , inspired by @entity6 in " @entity7 " and enamored of @entity8 in " @entity9			2
" i yearned for the passion and devotion of faith , as expressed @entity12 - style , to deal with my isolation as a child of mixed ethnicity in a black and white world			2
i did not fit anywhere , and the path of faith seemed to offer the greatest sense of belonging			2
my @entity22 - @entity21 father , a lifelong methodist , and my @entity25 mother , without a particular faith , insisted that my siblings and i attend church regularly -- even if they did n't			1
because we were in the military , we were exposed to various religions : i explored @entity33 and @entity34 traditions , as well as @entity35			2
i had many questions and could not accept faith without understanding			2
then , when i was 13 , my mother 's friend invited me to a @entity42 meeting			1
my mother warned me not to join anything , but i was moved by the beauty of the chanting of " @entity47 , " known as the @entity47 or sacred title of the @entity49			0
naturally , because i was told not to , i joined			0
it was the beginning of a journey culminating in my ordination as a priest in the @entity55 tradition			1
within the @entity56 , i am the first woman of @entity25 and @entity22 descent , the only ordained @entity59 woman and the first female priest in the @entity61			1
@entity62 has been the mainstay of my life , enabling me to understand life 's reality and providing a practice of faith to deal with that reality			1
i have learned to release the past and not give in to imagination or the future			0
@entity62 taught me that there is only now , the present moment			1
most people understand the law of cause and effect , or very simply " what goes around , comes around			1
" when i asked the question " why is this happening to me ? " as i explored various faiths , i never received an answer that made sense			0
@entity62 taught me that my life is the result of causes made in the past and my future would be the result of causes made in the present			1
the @entity49 , which outlines the path of the bodhisattvas , or those who forgo their own enlightenment to assist others on the path , helped me see that i made the cause to come into this life to fulfill a mission			0
my personal struggles in life provided me the experience and knowledge to be a bridge for others to find liberation			0
@entity42 practice around basic concepts has meant liberation from suffering discrimination , racism and even the loneliness of being the only one			0
once i applied the concepts , i gained greater understanding that my suffering had purpose , and i could use that suffering to help others			0
i understood the impermanence of suffering and that being attached to my suffering only created more			0
my work within the prison system is a direct result of being able to see the @entity125 nature within each person			1
five years ago , sangha members and i ( three women of color ) encountered a group of white male inmates , some of whom were white supremacists			1
all of us were quite surprised , but slowly we developed loving , compassionate relationships through which all of us were able to abandon our preconceptions about each other			0
today , our prison group contains people from @entity22 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity143 backgrounds , and our conversations touch on the issues of racism and prejudice as well as the development of faith			1
society holds some people i 've met in contempt and hatred ; i have seen them grow and find value in themselves even as i grew to love each one of them			2
of the seven released since 2005 , three are known to have continued in practice , and only one has re-offended			0
the practice of @entity62 has much to offer communities of color ; however , it may be difficult to find teachers and practitioners with the necessary experience			1
there is no national directory			0
we exist in myriad traditions and cities throughout the @entity171 in many traditions is often difficult and expensive , and finding teachers willing and able to address issues relative to being @entity21 is sometimes impossible			0
yet , progress is being made as we create sanghas within communities of color and assume the roles of clergy and lay teachers			2
it is definitely time for practitioners of color to step up and make ourselves known			1
our communities need us to be present now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			1

@entity190 , of @entity22 and @entity25 descent , was a *spiritual* seeker
@entity188 found @entity62 at 13 and is now priest in the @entity55 tradition
@entity62 is her mainstay , helping her understand the nature of reality and how to live
people of color who are practitioners need to make themselves known , she writes
