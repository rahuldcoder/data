-- a few years ago , @entity2 resident @entity1 worked as a waiter			1
now his day consists of planning , editing and posting a show for a large audience			1
his sound stage ? his home			2
@entity1 is part of a new breed of celebrity : the successful @entity13			1
not only that , he now makes a living just from his videos			1
under the name " @entity1 , " @entity1 puts on a regular show for 480,000 subscribers			2
he 's part of the community of @entity13 users who do n't just think of the site as a place for fun videos ( and with 1 billion unique users monthly , there are certainly plenty of casual viewers ) , but actively post to the site , putting a great deal of time and effort into entertaining their audience -- some of whom become " @entity39 famous " in the meantime			1
@entity1 is one of the subjects of a documentary , " please subscribe , " which examines the hardcore @entity13 community , which ran in theaters earlier this year and is now available streaming online			1
maintaining @entity13 fame and making a living for a lot of people , the idea of becoming famous -- and even making money -- on @entity13 would appear to be something that just happens overnight			1
but in cases like @entity54 - whose song " @entity56 " went viral - that 's not the whole story			2
@entity58 was already uploading a series of videos to @entity13 , when one became wildly popular , increasing his following on the site and leading to more videos			1
with the number of @entity13 subscribers having doubled in the last year , it should come as no surprise that we 're seeing more success stories like this as well			1
" the people on @entity13 are hard - working people , and they make a good living doing it , " which is something that director @entity73 said he wanted to show with " @entity74			1
" that living is made through @entity76 's @entity75 , which allows users to open their @entity13 accounts to advertisers , after which @entity76 selects the highest bidder			1
@entity13 get a cut of the profits			1
some , according to @entity84 , earn millions of dollars a year			2
@entity73 pointed out that most people on @entity13 are not " one - hit wonders			1
" " ' @entity1 ' uploaded hundreds of videos before getting recognition			2
to get successful is a hustle			2
" " i wish more people took the plunge into it and created an account , and realized it 's not just cat videos , " said @entity90 , another subject of " please subscribe , " who posts stream of consciousness vidoes as " @entity94 , " for his 638,500 subscribers , and then some			1
the nature of @entity13 celebrity at the same time , the top @entity13 have fans just like other celebrities			1
" the internet celebrity aspect is almost more of a personal thing			2
they come up to you , they see you on a regular basis , " said @entity90			0
" some youtubers upload five times a day			0
it 's like ' i know you , i was just with you yesterday			0
' it 's just like seeing a friend			0
" @entity1 remembers being pointed out by a woman on the street once , saying " it 's @entity1 ! i love @entity1 ! " " i expected she was going to talk to me , but they walked right past , " he said			0
" it was funny because she treated it as if i was just on her computer screen , not actually there			0
" @entity54 , who was suddenly everywhere in 2007 with his original song " @entity56 , " said he has gotten anecdotes from those among the video 's 93 million views telling him he changed their lives			0
" their 2 - year - old ca n't stop singing ' @entity56 ' at bedtime			0
their grandmother loves to hear me sing ' @entity141 , mr. @entity142			0
' they made their boss laugh by playing my ' @entity146 ' video and got forgiven for being late			0
these are the most rewarding [ things to hear ]			0
" the @entity150 , @entity149 , youtuber who only goes by the name @entity153 hit it out of the park with her very first video parodying " @entity157			0
" it made her an internet meme for what became known as the " @entity167 " face , which earned her more than 844,000 subscribers , a full - time @entity13 career that pays her bills , and an invite to appear on " @entity168			1
" " it was the most surreal , crazy , fun experience of my entire life			0
not only to be on tv , or to be on a @entity172 , but to be on @entity173 -- a show i love and watch all the time -- that was crazy			0
" " @entity177 " fan @entity176 was invited to appear at a high school in @entity179 after his video got 38 million views			0
" they toured me around the country , made me a festival where they sang , danced , did a play , made me a mural and a throne to watch it all			0
the parents came out , they made me protector of the student body , decorated the school in rainbows and after the performance surrounded me , hugging and kissing me like i was a king			0
" and what of the other benefits ? " @entity75 alone pays my phone and internet bill , " he said			2
" i was a starving artist , for six years , prior to going viral , i made $ 6,000 a year or less breeding dogs , doing photography , @entity202 and cutting firewood			2
when i went viral , money started coming in from tv ads that i was in , the @entity207 ' @entity177 ' song , ( which i still get checks from ) , licensing my videos , and public appearances			2
" youtubing as a business this experience has taught @entity213 about how the business of creativity works			0
" being my own boss gives me a perspective i never had before			0
i understand that to be creative for a living , especially by yourself and on the @entity39 , you have to be able to roll with the punches , be versatile , connect with your audience , and be very prolific			2
" and he wishes that the public at large knew how much work went into making @entity13 success happen			1
" i used to sit back and critique tv and movies and @entity13 much more harshly , " he said			1
" but now i fully understand the process and what it means to come up with stuff on a regular basis , and it 's hard work if you want to do it for a living			2
i actually work more hours a day now than i ever have in my life			0
luckily , i love what i do			0
but that 's what you have to do to make this work			2
" @entity54 -- who was posting to @entity13 for four months before hitting it big and now has more than 700,000 subscribers -- said , " i work months on some songs and videos that never see the light of day			1
there are other videos that take mere minutes , like my reading of dr. @entity249			2
" for @entity153 , comedic @entity13 videos come naturally			1
" to be honest , most are done in a day , " she admitted			0
" i generally come up with an idea the day before , or maybe not even that early , and i write , record , and edit all in the same day			0
and to be honest , i 've found that that 's usually best			0
" the @entity13 community - or something more ? @entity153 draws her inspiration from the " crazy , awesome thing " she calls the @entity13 community			1
" i had no idea before i posted that first video that there was anything even close to it out there			0
i 've met people and made friends that motivate and inspire me to make better , more creative videos every time i get to spend time with them			1
it 's a wonderful thing , really			0
" several years and many viral videos into its success though , one has to wonder , why @entity13 ? what has sustained this community for so many years ? " there 's a deeper connection between the creator and the audience than with traditional media , " @entity1 explained			1
indeed , one thing all of these @entity13 have in common is a consistent point of view and a conversational tone			1
" youtubers are often talking directly to the camera			0
this gives the audience a sense that they are talking directly to them			0
it 's because of this that i think the community is very tight and viewers and fans with take on a sense of ownership of the stuff created by the people they watch			1
" @entity176 put it this way : " the @entity13 community is humanity 's consciousness , the site is our memory			1
" in @entity58 's view , though , @entity13 is so big that it 's gone beyond the term " community			1
" " calling @entity13 a ' community ' in 2013 is like saying rock ' n ' roll is a ' community			1
' the term is too small			2
" @entity1 just hopes that @entity13 continues to expand and that will benefit the individual @entity13			1
" we 're in the middle of a time of big change in the entertainment world			0
this could turn into something even bigger or i could be left in the dust			0
i 'm enjoying the ride , though			0
