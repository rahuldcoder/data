@entity0 -- @entity2 approved wednesday the construction of a settlement in @entity0 just before @entity6 secretary of state @entity5 is to visit the country on a peace mission			1
@entity5 will meet with @entity2 , @entity9 and @entity11 officials in @entity11 and @entity0 from thursday to saturday in the wake of president @entity14 's efforts in @entity2 last march urging renewed peace talks			1
@entity9 chief peace negotiator @entity16 called out to the world thursday to stop @entity2 from building more settlement homes			1
letting @entity19 get away with it , takes away any motivation for @entity2 to work towards peace , he said			2
in january , the @entity23 said @entity2 settlements amount to " creeping annexation " of @entity9 territories by @entity2 and have taken a " heavy toll " on the rights and sovereignty of @entity27			1
the construction of new homes is " taking @entity9 land , lives and livelihoods , " @entity16 lamented			2
wednesday 's approval of a 69 - unit settlement in @entity0 -- which @entity27 consider to be the capital of their future state one day -- harkens to an incident in 2010 when @entity2 announced another @entity0 settlement during a visit by vice president @entity43			1
then secretary of state @entity44 called the announcement " insulting " to the @entity6			0
on wednesday , @entity46 , a @entity47 member from the left - wing @entity49 party , criticized wednesday 's settlement approval and described it as " provocation " by @entity2 prime minister @entity53 's government			1
the approval by an @entity2 planning committee was part of a " very long process " and now means that construction can start at any time , @entity54 said			1
" this is a provocation by @entity53 's government when @entity5 is coming to re-start the negotiations , " @entity54 said			2
" to approve these houses in @entity65 , or also known as @entity65 in @entity0 , is a foolish move			1
this means that @entity2 has no serious intentions to restart the peace process , " @entity54 said			0
@entity2 's construction of settlements " is more important than peace in the @entity71 , " @entity54 charged			1
but a senior @entity2 government official who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue said there was no political influence behind the approval process			0
" this is private land , private constructions and nothing to do with the government or with government agendas , " the official said			0
@entity86 , an advisor to the @entity0 mayor , said construction permission was granted by local planning and building committee			2
" it should be noted that the municipality has no legal right to stop the property ownership of the citizens to whom the ground belongs , " @entity86 said in a statement			0
" there is no change in the policy of the municipality over the last four years , and we are continuing to build in all the suburbs of the city according to the development program for @entity106 and @entity107 as one , " @entity86 said			0
thousands of housing units are expected to be built throughout @entity0 in coming years , @entity86 said			0
" new building in @entity0 is necessary for the development of the city and gives the opportunity for youngsters and students to live and buy , " @entity86 added			0
@entity116 , settlement watch director for the @entity2 activist group @entity117 , said the construction plan was initially filed in april 2012 , and the length of time behind its approval is typical			2
