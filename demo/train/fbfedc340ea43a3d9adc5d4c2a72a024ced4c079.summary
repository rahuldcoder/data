-- @entity1 did n't think anything of it when his face began to swell			0
he assumed he had just gained a couple of pounds			0
but when the swelling progressed to severe vomiting and frequent urination , he knew something was wrong			0
it turned out that both of his kidneys were failing			0
he was suffering from hypertension , a common ailment among @entity16 patients			2
" my blood pressure had scarred my kidneys so much they were surprised i did n't have a stroke then , " said @entity1 , 32			0
" i was a walking time bomb			0
" that was nearly 12 years ago			0
the @entity23 - based music producer and actor has been on dialysis and awaiting a kidney transplant since then			1
a study published this month by the @entity28 shows that @entity16 patients awaiting a new organ are less likely to get one than non-black patients			1
at the 275 transplant centers in the @entity31 , african - americans had at least a 35 % lower chance of receiving a live kidney donation , said dr. @entity35 of the @entity36 at the @entity37			1
at some centers , @entity16 - @entity31 had a 76 % lower chance of getting an organ			1
the study surveyed 247,707 adults registered for first - time kidney transplants from 1995 to 2007			1
about 92,000 people in the @entity31 are on a waiting list for a kidney transplant			1
more than one - third are african - americans , according to the @entity49			1
in 2011 , 5,771 living donor transplants were performed , 813 on @entity16 patients			1
" african - americans had lower odds of obtaining living donor kidney transplantation at every transplant center in the country , " @entity35 said			1
living donor transplants -- donations of an organ or part of an organ from a live person -- are the best option			1
a kidney from a living donor usually starts to function immediately			1
in some cases , a kidney from a deceased donor may require a patient to remain on dialysis until it begins to function			2
the racial disparity may be attributed to education levels , economic factors or medical characteristics such as blood type , @entity35 said			1
also , some centers may be more focused on deceased kidney transplants , she said			2
" there 's also a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes [ among african - americans ] that would preclude you to become a donor , " @entity35 said			1
@entity1 believes there 's a lack of support and knowledge about kidney donation among african - americans			1
he has asked family and friends for help , but to no avail			0
" i am exhausted , " he said			0
" i have a couple of white friends who received transplants and a few black friends whose families donated it to them			0
makes me wonder what i 'm doing wrong			0
" he says more education is needed , that potential donors need to know that it 's not a life sentence for them			2
" of course living donor kidney transplantation involves not only the recipient of the kidney , but also the donor , " @entity35 said			2
" it could be the social networks of @entity16 populations			0
" @entity35 advises frustrated @entity16 - @entity16 patients that it is never too late to take control of their medical care , and to continue to ask			2
she suggests patients educate themselves more on the process of living organ donation so that they become more comfortable speaking with potential donors			2
" if we continue to fight for them , and they continue to fight for themselves , we can reach a good solution , " @entity35 said			0
@entity1 has stopped asking family and friends for an organ , but he continues to produce music and act			0
his hope is that he can one day do those things away from a dialysis machine .			0
