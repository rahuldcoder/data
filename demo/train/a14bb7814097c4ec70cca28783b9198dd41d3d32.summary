-- @entity1 may be 86 years old , but she 's pretty hip			2
she keeps up with all the latest health news , and a while back , she called her daughter wanting to know whether she should start taking the herb ginkgo biloba			1
she 'd heard it might stave off alzheimer 's disease			2
" i told her not to bother , that it would n't make much of a difference , " says her daughter , @entity7 , a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the @entity10 , @entity11			0
" on the basis of what i 've read , i do n't think it staves off dementia			0
" @entity20 's advice makes a lot of sense , according to a study out this week in the @entity24			1
@entity25 is a top - selling herb and has been hailed by some as a memory - booster , but the new @entity30 study found it did n't help prevent @entity31 's or other forms of dementia in more than 3,000 elderly study subjects			1
ginkgo manufacturers say this is n't the first -- or the last -- word on the herb			0
" there is a significant body of scientific and clinical evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of ginkgo extract for both cognitive function and improved circulation , " said @entity37 , executive director of the @entity38			1
" but i do tell my mother there are other things she can do , " says @entity20 , who 's studied the brain and aging			1
" i tell her to go out and do things and see people every day and be active			0
" studies have shown that physical exercise , the kind that keeps the heart healthy , also keeps the brain healthy , according to the @entity61 's @entity60			1
people are like rats , @entity20 says			0
" if you put a rat in a cage by itself , it wo n't do well on cognitive tests			0
but if you give it toys and put other rats in its cage , they 're going to be smarter rats			0
" in addition to playing with toys and hanging out with your fellow rats , here are five other tips for keeping your memory sharp			1
@entity20 says they help work on memory centers of the brain , including the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus , identified in the diagram above			1
antioxidants @entity20 makes sure her mother takes vitamins a , @entity94 , and @entity95 they 're antioxidants , which prevent cell damage and are believed by some to slow down diseases of aging			1
" there are studies that suggest antioxidants might prevent dementia , " she says			1
fish oil supplements dr. @entity103 , director of the @entity104 on aging , says aging brains show signs of inflammation , and fish oil has anti-inflammatory properties			1
phosphatidylserine supplements phosphatidylserine is a lipid found naturally in the body			1
@entity103 says he 's not 100 percent convinced these supplements will help stave off dementia , but they 're worth a try			1
" if i start having memory problems when i get older , i 'll give them a trial run and see if they help , " says @entity103 , author of the new book " @entity118 : surviving the @entity124 of the @entity125			0
@entity126 @entity103 , who 's 57 , says that as he gets older , he might also try eating more foods with curry in them			2
" some studies in @entity131 show that those who ate curry once a week had better memory scores , " he said			2
cross-training your brain " our brains can be made stronger through exercise , " says @entity136 , assistant professor of in the department of health administration and policy at @entity139			0
" in the same way physical exercise can delay many of the effects of aging on the body , there 's some evidence cognitive exercise can at least delay the onset of @entity31 's			1
" but @entity136 says it 's not enough to do just one kind of brain exercise			2
" doing a crossword puzzle every day is good , but it 's the equivalent of doing only pushups -- your arms will get strong , but not the rest of your body			2
" he recommends doing other activities in addition , such as computing numbers in your head instead of using a calculator , or using one of the " brain gym " computer games designed to enhance brain function			0
as for @entity20 , who 's 60 , she thinks her best bet at staving off dementia does n't come in a bottle , or on a dinner plate , or in a computer game			2
" i 'm going to keep working on my research , and surround myself with young people , and do a lot of exercise , " she says			0
" i 'm going to be a happy old lady			0
that in and of itself is going to do a lot of good for my brain			0
