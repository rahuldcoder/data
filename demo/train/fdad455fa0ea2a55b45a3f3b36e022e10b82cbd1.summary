two @entity1 ships arrived at the coast of @entity3 on monday to begin efforts to collect thousands of @entity1 citizens who are fleeing the country after deadly attacks last week			1
the chartered ships reached the port of @entity12 in @entity13 , the coastal province where some of the worst violence targeting @entity1 facilities and workers took place , @entity1 state media reported			2
one of the two , the @entity18 , departed later monday for the southern @entity1 port city of @entity20 with 989 evacuees on board , according to the official @entity1 news agency @entity23			1
along with two other ships that are still en route , the vessels are being used to bring back almost 4,000 @entity1 citizens who are leaving because of the recent unrest , @entity23 said			1
@entity1 authorities said sunday that more than 3,000 @entity1 had already been evacuated from @entity3 after protests over @entity1 's decision to move an oil rig into disputed waters of the @entity34 spiraled into riots last week in which foreign - owned factories were burned and looted			1
at issue is the positioning of the rig in waters claimed by both @entity1 and @entity3			1
@entity3 claims the rig 's presence is " illegal , " while @entity1 says it has every right to drill and has castigated the @entity45 government for failing to ensure the safety of its nationals			1
two @entity1 citizens were killed in the violence and more than 100 were injured , authorities said			2
the crisis has frayed ties between the two @entity57 - run @entity55 nations , and there is little sign of either side backing down over the increasingly bitter territorial dispute			0
@entity62 tightened a series of chartered planes carried scores of @entity1 citizens , including 16 critically injured workers , back to @entity1 on sunday , @entity23 reported			2
the critically hurt patients were suffering from a range of injuries inflicted by beatings with iron bars , said @entity73 , a spokesman for the hospital in the western @entity1 city of @entity76 where they were admitted			2
the badly injured workers were employees of @entity78 , a contractor for an iron and steel complex being built in @entity13 , according to @entity1 state - run media			0
@entity45 authorities have clamped down on the unrest , arresting hundreds of people			0
they have beefed up security at key locations and urged citizens not participate in further protests			0
but that has n't stopped @entity1 from pressing ahead with the measures to extract thousands of its citizens from the country			0
@entity95 has also warned @entity1 people not to travel to @entity3 and said it will suspend some planned bilateral exchanges with @entity98 , according to @entity23			1
ships clash at sea out in the @entity34 , ships from both countries are facing off			0
@entity3 's state - run news agency @entity103 on saturday accused @entity1 of continuing to show " its aggressiveness by sending more military ships " to the area around the oil rig			1
the news agency cited @entity109 , an official at the @entity110 , as saying that @entity1 had 119 ships in the area saturday morning , including warships , coast guard vessels and fishing boats			0
some of the ships were provoking the @entity45 vessels by ramming them and firing water cannons at them , he said			0
@entity3 says the rig site is clearly on its continental shelf , and moreover , is in its @entity122			2
@entity98 has demanded that @entity1 remove the offending rig from the disputed waters , escort vessels from the region and hold talks to settle the issue			1
' we are not afraid of trouble ' @entity1 , for its part , has continued to accuse @entity45 ships of similar acts , saying they are trying to disrupt the oil rig 's drilling operation			1
it has declared a 3 - mile exclusion zone around the rig , which is operated by the state - owned oil and gas company @entity140			0
" we do not make trouble , but we are not afraid of trouble , " gen. @entity141 , the chief of the general staff of the @entity142 ( @entity142 ) , said thursday during a visit to the @entity144			0
" in matters of territory , our attitude is firm			0
we wo n't give an inch , " @entity141 said after meeting @entity150 chairman gen. @entity151			0
@entity144 concerns relations between @entity1 and @entity3 soured this month when the @entity1 platform began drilling for oil near the @entity157 , which are claimed by both countries			1
at the time , the @entity159 called the move " provocative , " saying it " raises tensions			0
" @entity95 has laid claim to most of the @entity34 , putting it at odds with several of its neighbors in the region , including the @entity167 and @entity168			1
@entity1 is also locked in a bitter dispute with @entity170 over a group of tiny islands in the @entity173			0
while many commentators say @entity3 has every right to be upset over the positioning of the @entity1 rig , at least one analyst says the issue not as clear cut as some suggest			1
" geographical proximity alone is not an unequivocal basis for claiming sovereignty or sovereign rights , " writes @entity182 in the @entity183			0
@entity182 , a senior fellow at the @entity188 at @entity189 , says @entity3 's claim to the @entity157 is " seriously weakened " by @entity3 's recognition of @entity1 's sovereignty over the @entity157 and the lack of protest between 1958 and 1975			1
in 1974 , the two countries fought the @entity196 , which ended in a @entity1 victory and complete control over the land and surrounding waters			2
after the reunification of @entity3 in 1975 , @entity3 's leaders publicly renewed the country 's claim to the islands , but the issue remains unresolved			2
" we have to acknowledge there are territorial disputes , " including " what exactly is the status quo and who is seeking to change it , " @entity151 said thursday at the news conference with @entity141 of the @entity142			0
his comments were a veiled reference to @entity217 's view that @entity95 is attempting to change the status quo by more aggressively seeking to establish control over disputed areas			2
