-- winning a pageant title is life - changing , especially during the year of your reign			2
if it 's a big crown , like a state title , it can be like a full - time gig as you prepare for the national event and make appearances			1
@entity10 set right to work after getting her tiara on june 21 , when she was named miss @entity13			1
she reportedly had even dropped out of the @entity15 so she could prepare for the @entity17 contest in september			1
but now , she wo n't be going to the premier beauty contest			2
pageant officials announced friday there had been a mistake in tabulating what must have been very close final scores			1
and days after getting her crown , @entity24 was giving it back , so the @entity29 @entity13 organization could give it to @entity30 , originally announced as first runner - up			1
the executive director of the pageant said on @entity34 that the organization had to make things right			0
" integrity means doing the right thing at all times and in all circumstances			0
it takes having the courage to do the right thing , no matter what the consequences will be , " @entity40 wrote			0
@entity10 's mother , @entity45 , told the @entity46 she was told that one judge changed his mind in the last 15 seconds and tried to indicate it on his ballot			2
" it was a human error , " @entity40 told the paper			0
" we have two auditors ... but they unfortunately missed one of the markings on the ballot			0
" @entity30 , a student at @entity58 , said on her @entity34 page that she had bonded with @entity24 during their week at the competition			2
" i know our friendship will remain strong , " she wrote , before going on to thank pageant officials for their honesty and integrity			2
in a blog linked off her @entity68 page , @entity10 said : " there is one big idea that i would like to emphasize : i was miss @entity13 for a glimpse , but more importantly , i have been @entity10 since day one			1
a title does not define me			0
it opens doors , but it does not dictate who i am and where i am going			0
i would like to think of opportunities like this as stepping stones to my future			0
i can not deny that this was one of the biggest " steps " i have come across , and i had become very comfortable and excited about the growth it would bring			0
" the @entity13 mix - up is similar to one in 2013 where the announced winner of @entity87 , @entity88 , gave up her crown after 24 hours when officials discovered a typographical error			1
and it comes just after @entity93 had her @entity17 dreams squashed when officials ruled her out because she is too old under pageant rules .			1

officials say there was a tabulation mistake
@entity30 was the *actual* winner and @entity10 had to give up her crown
@entity10 writes on blog that she can not be defined by a title
recently a winner in @entity108 was declared too old for @entity17 contest
