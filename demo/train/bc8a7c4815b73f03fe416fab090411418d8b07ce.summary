-- the @entity1 has just agreed to take on the case of @entity3			1
@entity4 , a white woman , argues that she has been a victim of the university 's race - conscious admission policies ; the university contends that its drive for racial and ethnic diversity is educationally enriching -- a benefit to all students			1
will the ugly discourse that generally characterizes debate over racially preferential policies disappear with the wave of a magic @entity1 wand ? it seems unlikely			1
the issue is a cat with many more than nine lives			0
it arrived in the early 1970s and , despite many attacks , some of which have taken the form of amendments to state constitutions , it has survived in pretty fine fettle			0
the court will have only eight justices to hear the arguments			2
@entity33 , having been involved in the case as solicitor general in the @entity37 administration , has bowed out of participation			2
her absence , however , leaves five justices likely to express at least some degree of skepticism about the racial preferences given to @entity45 minorities in the admissions process			0
has the @entity47 been enriched by academic diversity ? maybe			0
but equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter @entity53			2
there are certainly wide gaps in the average sat scores between blacks and @entity58 , on the one hand , and whites and @entity53 , on the other hand			1
among freshmen entering the @entity47 in 2009 who did not fall into the top 10 % of their high school class ( automatic admission at the university ) , @entity53 scored at the 93rd percentile of 2009 @entity69 takers nationwide , whites at the 89th percentile , @entity58 at the 80th percentile and blacks at the 52nd percentile			1
startling ? no. this picture has been well known for a long time			0
heartbreaking , yes , because the numbers mean the underperforming minority students are being woefully ill served by the k - 12 school system			2
moreover , arriving at institutions of higher education with an academic disadvantage , they do not catch up , as it has become clear			0
justice @entity84 ( now retired ) wrote the majority opinion in a @entity87 affirmative action case decided by the high court in 2003			1
the life of that decision is now on the line in @entity4			1
@entity84 should not be proud of her work in that decision			1
it was -- not to put too fine a point on it -- dishonest			0
she claimed that the law school engaged " in a highly individualized , holistic review of each applicant 's file			0
" race was considered as simply one factor among many			2
did she actually believe her own argument ? the law school 's own expert provided data clearly showing racial double standards in admissions -- contradicting her " holistic " claim			0
the @entity87 's undergraduate college mechanically awarded substantial points to an applicant from an " underrepresented " minority group , and @entity84 pretended the law school 's process was very different			1
in fact , as justice @entity117 pointed out , the law school simply concealed a race - driven admissions process that involved preferences actually greater than those given to undergraduate applicants			1
taunting his colleagues , he called it an exercise in " hide the ball			0
" @entity84 's whole decision rested on the assumption that preferences were temporary medicine for a problem already fixing itself			1
there was every reason to " expect , " she wrote , that in another quarter of a century , the pool of academically high - performing black and @entity135 applicants would have so grown as to make race - conscious admissions the strategy of a bygone era			1
the credulous reader might believe this confident optimism			0
the knowledgeable reader will know that she was either scandalously ignorant of the real record or deliberately and irresponsibly deceptive			0
in the dozen years preceding her opinion , the black - white gap in mean sat scores had actually widened , and continues to do so			1
hopes are running high among opponents of racial preferences that a majority of five on the court will declare affirmative action policy unconstitutional in public colleges and universities			1
( private schools would not be affected by a reversal of the policy			0
) no fancy constitutional footwork -- just a clean execution			0
for that to happen , five justices would have to be comfortable with the idea of screaming media headlines and much blog chatter about a court hostile to racial equality and indifferent to the gaps in opportunity that have for so long characterized @entity173 society			2
will one of the men running for president raise his hand and say loudly and clearly , i oppose racial preferences in admissions to institutions of higher education ? do n't hold your breath , unless you are willing to keel over from lack of oxygen			0
follow @entity186 on @entity187 join the conversation on @entity189 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			2

the @entity1 has agreed to take on a case about race - conscious admission policies
@entity192 : if the court declares affirmative action unconstitutional , it *'ll* be surprising
she says that the life of a 2003 decision by justice @entity84 is now on the line
@entity192 : the gap in mean sat scores between blacks and whites persists
