@entity0 , @entity1 -- vote for me or burn in hell			0
i ca n't imagine someone running for office saying that			2
and yet four candidates -- @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 -- have said they had a sense that @entity14 was leading them to run			1
how far can we be from " vote for me or burn in hell " when it seems we 're already comfortable with " vote for me , i 've been called by @entity14 " ? there was a time when if a candidate wanted to inject faith into a campaign he or she would be photographed going to church or shaking the rev. @entity29 's hand			1
now it seems many @entity32 campaigns are n't complete without claiming @entity14 's seal of approval , which suggests the other candidates may be running without it			1
such a sentiment is an ideological @entity36 for comedians like @entity38 and @entity39 , but for conservatives trying to secure the @entity32 nomination , it 's a highly manipulative campaign tool			1
consider the words of @entity11 's wife , @entity43			0
during a stop in @entity46 last week she said her husband was being brutalized by the media because of his faith and that while his @entity32 opponents are " there for good reasons			1
and they may feel like @entity14 called them , too ... i truly feel like we are here for that purpose			2
" when @entity11 was asked about his wife 's comments on " @entity61 , " he said " i think she 's right in both cases			0
my understanding is that she said i 'm the most conservative candidate in the race and , ' he 's a @entity68			0
' " @entity10 was a guest on the @entity69 recently and recapped a conversation he said he had with @entity14 before entering the race			0
" i felt like @entity72 when @entity14 said , ' i want you to go into @entity74 and lead my people out			1
... but you should n't question @entity14			1
" repeat : you should n't question @entity14			1
but why are n't we questioning the candidates who make these kinds of statements the same way we would question whether @entity14 actually wanted a particular athlete to win a game ? i do believe a person 's faith is personal , but i 'm not the one using it to get votes			1
four candidates have claimed a level of divine intervention with their campaign , which either means the creator of heaven and @entity95 is hedging his bets or somebody 's mistaken			1
when a candidate claims to have a plan to create jobs or turn our economy around , we expect thoughtful analysis , as we have seen with president @entity104 's jobs package and @entity10 's 9 - 9 - 9 plan			2
why are we not demanding the same level of critical thinking with respect to these candidates ? is the media so afraid to appear to be attacking someone 's faith that interviewers do n't bother to ask follow - up questions ? if i could trade places with @entity116 , who is moderating tuesday 's debate , i would ask , " now which ones of you were really called by @entity14 and which ones are hearing voices in your head ? " then let them discuss among themselves			1
it seems like a fair line of questioning , especially when you consider @entity10 is telling a particular voting bloc that he is like @entity72 and @entity11 is telling the same voters that @entity10 and others misheard @entity14			0
why would n't conservative @entity68 want to hear this line of questioning , since they are the sheep who are potentially being targeted by deceptive , power - hungry wolves ? now i know it seems as if i 'm picking on @entity32 , but trust me , i 'm equally disgusted by @entity139 who use religion to win elections			1
i still recoil in horror at the memory of then sen. @entity145 , on the eve of the rev. @entity148 's birthday in 2008 , standing in front of a baptist church in @entity151 , trying to out - black preach then sen. @entity104 , who was visiting @entity153 in @entity154 the same day			0
and at both locations , the crowd was just eating it up , like extras in a @entity160 movie			0
when people ask why i 'm not a @entity163 , this is one of the reasons i give			0
but not even in the heat of those moments did i hear them say they were called by @entity14 to run			2
not because @entity139 are not religious , but because they seem to know where the line is			1
this current @entity32 candidates seem to have no idea that there is a line , let alone its location			1
it is beginning to feel like if we do n't start pushing back soon , in the next election we 're going to see campaign slogans like , " vote for me or @entity14 wo n't bless @entity181			2
" " vote for me , or you 'll be left behind			0
" " vote for me ... @entity183 did			0
" on august 4 , 2010 , just before 10:30 p.m. , former longtime rep. @entity184 stood in front of a group of supporters in a small city in @entity1 to deliver a concession speech			0
the @entity32 had just lost his bid to be governor , a job he said he left @entity193 to pursue because of " @entity194			2
" " @entity14 's got something better in mind for us , " he said , and in january he finished his term in the @entity196			0
today @entity184 is back in @entity1			0
no word yet if @entity14 told him to do so or if this is the " something better " the @entity202 had in mind			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity206 : four @entity32 candidates say they felt called to run
candidates have grown *bolder* about using their religious faith to justify their campaigns , he says
he asks why people do n't push back and question claims of divine intervention
@entity206 : @entity139 as well as @entity32 *wrongly* inject faith into *politics*
