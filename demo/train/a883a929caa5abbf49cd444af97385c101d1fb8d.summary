-- @entity2 's poverty has been much discussed since its massive earthquake , but little has been said of its rich , and equally fraught , history			2
for african - americans , @entity2 's tragedy hits close to home			1
for more than two centuries the tiny , at times fragile , republic has inspired black political activism in the @entity11			1
born of the influence of the @entity14 and @entity15 revolutions , @entity2 , once prized as the jewel of the @entity17 , changed the course of its history by engineering a revolution that startled the world			2
once a colony of slaves under @entity14 rule in the 18th century , @entity2 transformed itself into the first black republic and one of the first nations in the @entity29 to outlaw slavery			1
it is a breathtakingly inspirational story : slaves revolted en masse in 1791 under the leadership of @entity34 , a brilliant statesman and military strategist who was influenced by the @entity37 ideals of universal freedom and citizenship			2
ultimately , the rebels defeated @entity42 's army and @entity43 before declaring independence in 1804			0
the founders of the @entity46 had celebrated the news of revolution in @entity14 , but news of the revolt in @entity2 did n't receive the same applause			0
news of this successful revolution led by slaves reverberated across the @entity55 to the @entity11 and brought chills up the spines of whites -- including president @entity59 , who deplored the revolution and despised the new republic 's existence			1
but it emboldened @entity15 - @entity15 slaves			0
fears that @entity2 's successful revolt could inspire slave insurrections in the @entity11 led to increased restrictions on the movements of blacks in @entity72 states			1
coupled with concerns over the stability of slavery in @entity76 , @entity2 represented a powerful threat to the comfort , safety and security of the new @entity46			0
in antebellum @entity11 , and during the @entity81 , black and white abolitionists saw @entity2 as an example of the potential and possibilities of black political leadership			1
in many respects , @entity2 's liberation from @entity14 rule proved to be a high point , sadly followed by a seemingly endless cycle of economic poverty , foreign intervention -- including @entity15 occupation from 1915 to 1934 -- government corruption , and dictatorships			0
yet there is another , equally important aspect of @entity2 history , one that black @entity11 identify with deeply			1
during the period of antebellum slavery and after , @entity2 profoundly impacted the imagination of @entity15 political activism			2
on the eve of the @entity81 , @entity105 spoke for most african - americans when he referred to the " bright example " of @entity2			1
he called @entity34 " the noble liberator and law - giver of his brave and dauntless people			0
" @entity105 and other blacks considered @entity34 one of the greatest self - made men of the 19th century			0
@entity55 migration to the @entity11 , beginning in the early 20th century , transformed black political activism			2
immigrants such as @entity118 and @entity119 emerged as street speakers in @entity121			0
and the @entity122 remained a touchstone for radical black political activists			0
@entity125 , a @entity126 - born author and activist , wrote a 1939 history of the revolt , " @entity130 , " that remains a classic in @entity133 scholarship			0
the immigration of @entity135 in increasing numbers after the passage of major immigration reform in 1965 has allowed @entity2 culture to establish critical beachheads in cities such as @entity142 , @entity143 , and @entity144			2
@entity2 's culture -- its food , music , flag , and proud revolutionary tradition -- resonates alongside of contemporary african - american culture			1
the popularity of hip hop musician @entity155 , the proliferation of @entity2 sports stars , and the prevalence of @entity159 [ @entity159 ] words such as " @entity152 " in rap music attest to @entity2 's influence			0
as the @entity2 people prepare to rebuild their republic , we would do well to remember that the tragedy of @entity2 is not a failure of black power but ultimately the frustration of it , one that involves mistakes by not only @entity135 but by western powers as well , including the @entity11			1
@entity135 are the descendants of the great black revolution for liberation , imbued with a history of wrestling with crises			1
the spirit of the @entity2 people is resilient and resourceful			2
these values will serve them well even during this unimaginable devastation			0
the @entity2 people can also take comfort in the knowledge that african - americans continue to find deep kinship , one forged in the shared crucible of slavery as well as heroic resistance against this system , in their current plight and efforts to rebuild @entity192			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			0

@entity197 : for 200 years , @entity2 revolution has inspired black activism in the @entity11
@entity195 : @entity2 slaves , led by @entity34 , founded first black republic
@entity135 are descendants of revolution , with a resilient , resourceful spirit , @entity195 says
