@entity0 , @entity1 -- launching a show at @entity4 can be a risky business , but sometimes it pays off			1
" @entity9 , " " heroes " and " @entity11 " all went on to spectacular first seasons after panels at @entity4			1
@entity20 's " @entity19 " seems like it might benefit the most from @entity4 , with an audience that already knows the show 's title from the comic book on which it 's based			1
an extremely creepy display promoting the series , with two bloody bodies and words scrawled on a wall in blood , greeted many con - goers on the floor			1
this is the network 's way of letting fans know that they do n't intend to hold back on the violence and gore			1
it 's just one example of how this year , more than ever , the networks are hoping to build buzz around their new shows , as well as keep or grow the audience for established ones			1
to do that , they try to give the fans what they want			2
" i think fans want to meet the cast and creators , and they want a bit of inside information , " said @entity45 , chief marketing officer of @entity46 ( which is owned by @entity47 , owner of @entity2 )			2
" all fans are looking for a unique , fun experience with the shows they love			2
" @entity57 certainly made its presence known , with free bags promoting many of their shows handed out to fans as they registered			1
@entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 were also ubiquitous			2
shows such as " @entity68 " and " @entity69 " were being promoted in a variety of ways outside the convention , including a takeover of a nearby restaurant			2
@entity66 plastered ads all over buses in @entity0			0
inside , it held a panel for four of its shows , including " @entity80 , " which is extremely popular at @entity4			1
one thing that ca n't miss at @entity4 is free food , and @entity83 served up free burgers and soda on behalf of the upcoming animated series " @entity87			1
" then there 's the low - key approach ; of course , low - key at @entity4 means driving through town with a bullhorn			1
@entity94 did this to promote the return of " @entity97			0
" " @entity102 , " about a family given superhero powers , gave attendees the chance to " lift " a car themselves			0
stars @entity105 and @entity106 showed the pilot as well , and @entity105 talked to the media about this change in tone after the extremely dark " @entity80			0
" " for me , it 's just the perfect marriage of genres , and i 'm ready to explore more of the lighter side , " she said			1
@entity106 , with his background as the thing in the " @entity119 " movies , was asked about playing another superhero			0
" i just think it 's a huge genre , there 's so much room to grow			1
just look at @entity4 , it 's like @entity126 , " he said			1
" i 'm happy to do a show that blends genres			0
" of course , there are shows that are already perennial favorites at the convention , such as " @entity132 , " which had ads plastered all over the convention center			0
and there 's " @entity136 , " which once again wowed the fans with the fictional band from the show , @entity141 , doing a music video of @entity144 's " @entity143			1
" the crowd also cheered at the announcement that @entity147 would be playing @entity136 's mother			1
stars @entity149 and @entity150 were in rare form talking to the media			0
they riffed on the power of the internet to keep " @entity136 " on the air and the upcoming season			2
@entity149 said that much of what was said at the panel was a surprise to him			0
" ' @entity161 ' as a guest star ? news to me , " he said			0
@entity164 who guest - starred in season one , will also reprise her character			0
now that @entity136 's best friend , sister and brother - in - law are in on his spy secrets , what about @entity141 ? " i kind of like that we kind of operate around the spy world , inadvertent , " said @entity172 , who plays the @entity174 half of the duo			2
" i 'd like to see more of us accidentally helping out			0
" one show with something to prove was @entity181 's " @entity180 , " which showed the pilot to an audience that came away seeming fairly impressed			1
of course , even the meaning of the show 's title still remains a mystery			2
the producers and cast were n't able to provide many more clues , aside from what was presented in the pilot , which involves ( spoiler alert ! ) some mysterious detainees trying to win their freedom and a shocking ending			0
" that moment at the end , i was like , ' what the heck was going on ? ' " said actor @entity199			0
" i just wanted the chance to read for it , and it was a dream come true			0
" the mystery continues to build around the show , but the biggest mystery of all may be whether this show , like the other new offerings for the season , will catch on			0
if so , they can look forward to a triumphant return like " @entity136 " and " @entity132			0

" @entity9 , " " heroes , " " @entity11 " all went on to spectacular first seasons after panels at @entity4
