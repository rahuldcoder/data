-- @entity1 retained his gold jersey at the @entity3 despite being caught up in a huge pile - up involving the leading riders near the end of tuesday 's fourth stage from @entity8 to @entity9			1
@entity10 of @entity11 celebrates as he wins the 225km fourth stage of the @entity3			1
@entity10 of @entity11 edged out @entity14 @entity13 and fellow @entity17 cyclists @entity15 and @entity18 in a sprint finish to the rain - hit 225km leg which saw the race move from the @entity22 into @entity14			1
they moved clear after the main pack endured a major spill two kilometers from the end of the stage , which featured the first real climbs of the race			2
@entity29 's @entity1 now has a nine - second lead over @entity14 sprint specialist @entity31 , who moved up to second as the top 57 riders involved in the crash were given the same time as the leaders			1
@entity15 is third , 11 seconds off the pace , with @entity10 next at the same time following his fourth - place finishes on the two previous stages			1
" my goal before starting the @entity3 was to win a stage , " @entity10 told the @entity3 's official web site			1
" i accomplished that here in @entity9 and now we 'll just take it one day at a time			2
however , i really want to direct my first words to my fellow racers in the peloton who were involved in the spill			0
" i just hope everyone can continue the race			0
as for me , i received great support from my team and that made my job much easier			0
" on a difficult day for riding , the temperature dropped from @entity57 to @entity58 and persistent rain led to several falls for the competitors			0
@entity62 was one to cross the finish line in an apparent pain , though no details were released as to his condition			0
@entity67 of @entity68 led a breakaway from the 21km mark with @entity71 ( @entity72 ) , @entity73 ( @entity74 ) and @entity75 ( @entity76 ) , and they built a 14 - minute lead by 55km			0
however , that was slowly trimmed to just 2:35 with 47km remaining , and then to less than two minutes after the third and final ranked climb			0
once they were caught , @entity81 of @entity82 went 10 seconds clear with 10km left but was also reeled in just before the mass crash			2
the riders have a much much - needed day off on wednesday before moving to @entity86 for the 174km fifth stage from the @entity89 city of @entity90 to the coastal city of @entity92 in @entity93			1
@entity95 rider @entity94 became the first entrant to quit the event , meaning that new zealander @entity98 of the @entity100 team is now the only man with a chance of completing all three of the sport 's major three - week races this season			0
the duo started the @entity106 , the @entity107 and the @entity3 along with @entity1 , @entity95 's @entity108 and @entity110 @entity109 , with the latter trio failing to finish in @entity112 .			2
