-- @entity1 , 54 , knows the importance of preventive medicine			2
as a health care worker , she goes for scheduled checkups			2
so when she went in for a routine dental exam last year , she did n't expect more than a cleaning , maybe a filling			2
but her dentist found something more serious			1
" she told me i had a lesion on my cheek and that it needed to be checked , " @entity1 said			2
" after a lot of tests , they found it was oral cancer			1
" i thought surely this was a mistake			2
i never smoked , i never drank heavily , and i never had a family history of this			2
how could this be ? " she asked			2
about 34,000 new @entity25 cases of oral cancer are diagnosed each year , and the numbers are rising , according to the @entity28			1
although oral cancer has primarily been a man 's illness , affecting six men for every woman , the foundation says that over the past 10 years , that ratio has become two men to each woman			1
the foundation attributes the rise to the increase in the number of women who smoke and drink excessively , because both tobacco and alcohol trigger oral cancer			1
but there is another factor			2
in some cases , women are being found to have oral cancer caused by @entity51 , or the human papillomavirus ( version 16 )			1
different versions of @entity51 are present in most cases of cervical cancer			1
like cervical cancer , in oral cancer cases , the virus is transferred through sexual activity			1
watch more on the hpv - oral cancer link based on recent data , the @entity28 believes in people under the age of 50 , @entity51 may even be replacing tobacco as the primary cause of the spread of oral cancer			1
@entity1 was shocked when she heard her cancer contained hpv cells			1
" i said , ' what ? how is that possible ? ' " she exclaimed			2
" but doctors told me that it might have been caused by something i did , years and years ago			0
it could actually show up later and cause the cancer			1
" @entity79 : mouth cancer @entity51 causes irregular cells to multiply , the virus thrives in a moist , dark environment , said dr. @entity84 , a prosthodontist and director of @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity88			1
prosthodontists specialize in tooth replacement , jaw restructuring , disease and injuries to the mouth			0
" the mouth is a perfect place for it to grow			0
" by transferring the virus during oral sex , it stays in the mouth and causes lesions			1
" it 's something we are very much aware of and look for , especially in women , " he said			0
her dentist caught the cancer before it spread , a fact that @entity110 attributes to her biannual checkups			1
when found early , oral cancer patients have an 80 to 90 percent survival rate			1
a good dentist will look for possible signs of oral cancer by checking the cheeks , the tongue , the tonsils and the larynx for possible lesions , says the @entity122			1
" that 's why we ask the patients simple things , to move your tongue , move it sideways , stick your tongue out , say ahhh , " @entity84 said			1
' " we want to get a good view of the mouth			0
" @entity79 : @entity51 infection since @entity110 's cancer was diagnosed in march 2008 , she 's undergone surgery and has had about four months of radiation			1
she is still in rehabilitation to help her chew and open her mouth wider			0
she uses a mouth exerciser that helps her stretch the muscles that were affected by her operation			0
she also went through rehab when she broke her collarbone after her radiation treatments , because her bones had become so brittle			0
" it just snapped one day , " she said with a shrug			0
" that 's part of the side effects from the radiation			0
" her other side effects are minor			0
she constantly has dry mouth and carries water with her everywhere			0
she avoids anything spicy or acidic , because it can sting the area where the cancer was removed			2
she lost almost 50 pounds after the surgery because she could n't eat			0
in some ways she considers the weight loss a good thing because it also reduced her high blood pressure and she was able to drop that medication			0
" for everything , there is a blessing , " she said			0
although @entity110 is cancer free now , she said she is considering enrolling in a trial that uses a form of the hpv vaccine to prevent patient 's oral cancer from recurring			1
@entity79 : chewing tobacco : not a safe alternative to cigarettes " it 's been a long road to recovery			0
but i am very fortunate			0
i 've had great treatment and great care , " she said			0
" but the most important thing is i want women to be aware of oral cancer and make sure they do n't ignore a sore in their mouth , or pain			1
it could be something , " @entity1 said			0
" and it needs to be checked out			0
that checkup can save your life			0

about 34,000 new @entity25 cases of oral cancer diagnosed annually ; numbers are rising
chief factors are excessive smoking and drinking
human papillomavirus also sometimes a cause
when found early , oral cancer patients have an 80 to 90 percent survival rate
