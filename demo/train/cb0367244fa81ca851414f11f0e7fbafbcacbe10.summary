-- you have burning questions , and we have burning answers ( we really need to stop writing these columns by candlelight )			1
that 's why , this week , we decided to take a passel of queries from our friends , followers and readers			2
we received these queries via e-mail , @entity14 and in - person conversations			1
we spunked up the wording a bit to keep you healthily entertained			2
please excuse the myriad " @entity20 " references to come			2
we hate ourselves , too			2
so my friend recently posted about something really big in the news -- ok , how much he likes @entity27 's " @entity20 , " but , hey , that 's big in my world -- on @entity14			1
i saw this right before i was about to post something akin to , " @entity27 is obviously one of the four @entity28			2
it 's only a matter of time until the @entity33 heaves its last metaphorical breath			2
" how can i create a post stating the exact opposite opinion to my friend 's without sounding like a total tool who is passive aggressively jabbing at him " publicly " ? and how can i do this without having to be overly disclaimer - ish , state caveats , water down my thoughts , etc. ? although we often warn y'all not to post tool - y stuff on your @entity47 , what it comes down to is this : your timeline is your canvas on which you can post anything you please , and no one can stop you from opening the proverbial floodgates ( unless , of course , you 're violating @entity14 's @entity57 in some way			1
) if you are merely -- by happenstance -- sharing your disdain for the artist behind what is frighteningly deemed " the song of the summer " ( can you tell that we share your derision ? ) at the same instance that your pal is drooling all over it , by all means , go ahead and let loose			2
only an overly sensitive ( and paranoid ) person would take a post on your timeline about a ( @entity72 ! ) pop star as a direct affront to his taste			0
however , if you are seeking to directly counter his point of view via your epistle , maybe include your friend in the post via tag -- in a constructive way			0
for example : " i am so not digging this jam			0
why the eff is she throwing a wish in a well ? @ @entity88 , what about the song gets you going so ? " if your friend is cool , you might just inspire a pretty interesting dialogue			0
still , a recent study showed that those who use @entity14 as an outlet to get out all their gripes are basically the bane of their " friends ' " existence , so maybe you better save the rants about the @entity102 's @entity101 © for next time you consume an entire bottle of wine at your buddy 's birthday party -- you know , before the tears start			1
out of politeness , i 've accepted @entity14 friend requests from any family members who have sent them			1
i did n't have the foresight to limit their ability to post on my wall , and now several of them -- namely an overzealous uncle and aunt -- have taken it over			1
what 's the least controversial way to get them to stop ? there are a lot of fiddly ways to limit who can see what on your @entity129 and who can respond and blah , blah , blah			1
therefore , we can understand why you did n't safeguard your digital digs from your extended family			0
luckily for you , there 's a quick fix : each time you go to post a kitten video or an inspirational quote or lyric from " @entity20 " ( you 're totally the friend in the first letter			0
) on your timeline , click on " friends , " right next to " @entity145			0
" scroll down to " custom , " and from there you can block specific people from seeing your timeline post , and consequently littering it with inane comments			0
that should quell the tide of familial overfamiliarity for a while			0
in the meantime , maybe plan a visit or pick up the phone or something			0
it seems like your aunt and uncle miss you			0
or are shut - ins			0
recently , a friend whom i see quite often sent me a @entity14 message reading : " i think we 're growing apart			1
" i 'm kind of appalled , considering we see each other every few weeks and e-mail and whatever a lot during the day -- also , @entity14 message ? are we 14 here ? maybe he 's pissed because i finally have a girlfriend ? who knows			1
anyway , how do i answer this ? @entity14 message ? e-mail ? phone ? carrier pigeon ? wow , your friend is lame			1
or just really , really cowardly			0
if -- with the knowledge that your friend is lame and cowardly -- you still want to keep the friendship alive and high - steppin ' , might we suggest , and this is crazy , pulling up his number and calling him maybe ?			1

your @entity47 is your canvas , our @entity190 columnists say
for overzealous relatives on @entity14 , limit ability to see your posts
calling can be better than a @entity14 message for *conflict*
