-- throughout my career , i 've been fortunate to have many different roles and responsibilities , serving as an international humanitarian ambassador , television host , model , actress and businesswoman			0
but the role that 's most fulfilling -- and the one that is most important to me -- is " @entity12			0
" first and foremost , as a parent , i welcomed the announcement that 92 mayors from across the @entity16 have signed a letter supporting the @entity19 's safeguards against mercury			1
this is a brilliant testimony to the mayors ' understanding of the fundamental need for clean healthy air and water			1
although i do my best to be sure my two sons grow up healthy , strong , independent and responsible , i can not control what is in the air they breathe			2
right now , millions of kids across this country breathe in pollution pumped into the air by coal - fired power plants			1
this can impair a child 's development and cause asthma attacks , the no. 1 reason kids miss school			1
these plants are also the largest source of mercury , a potent brain poison that is linked to severe learning disabilities , developmental problems , and lower iqs			1
in 2010 , power plants emitted 66,050 pounds of toxin into the air			1
@entity51 from coal - fired power plants rains down into our rivers , streams and oceans , where it can contaminate the fish we eat			1
exposure to mercury is especially dangerous for pregnant women and young children			2
because fish is a dietary staple for my family , this is a huge personal concern , but every family deserves the right to eat safe , healthy fish without worrying about toxic mercury			0
the good news is that last year , the @entity73 administration set historic mercury and air toxics standards to curb mercury pollution from new coal - fired power plants			1
these safeguards will cut mercury pollution from power plants by more than 90 % and dramatically reduce our kids ' exposure to mercury , as well as cancer - causing substances such as arsenic and chromium			1
unacceptably , however , these landmark protections are under attack in @entity91			0
on wednesday , the @entity92 will vote on whether to overturn the @entity51 and @entity93			1
this shortsighted legislation goes so far that it would prevent the @entity19 from ever acting on this issue again			2
it has taken decades to finally get clean - air protections from mercury in place			1
we ca n't let @entity91 overturn them			0
by cleaning up or retiring coal plants and transitioning to clean , renewable energy sources such as wind and solar , we can protect our economy , create jobs and attain cleaner air for our families			1
clean energy solutions are ready to go , and we have only just begun tapping their potential			0
in @entity113 , 10 % of all electricity last month was supplied by solar power , and @entity113 gets about the same amount of sunshine as @entity117			0
while here in the @entity16 , more than 20 % of the energy being generated in the states of @entity121 and @entity122 is already from wind			0
with the price of clean energy technologies coming down dramatically , this is the wrong time for our government to backtrack			0
as a recognizable face and voice , i 've been fortunate to have the opportunity to advocate for the health of women and children around the world , from @entity136 to @entity137			0
the @entity16 is the last place i 'd expect to see politicians roll back public - health protections that are already in place			0
that 's why i 'm working with the @entity143 to raise awareness and encourage people to take action by contacting their senators and asking them to support keeping the @entity51 and @entity93 intact			2
@entity91 has the opportunity to be a part of the solution			0
it can protect our children 's health and our air and water			2
there 's no more important job than that			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			2

@entity161 : coal - fired power plants largest source of mercury pollution , a brain poison
@entity51 tied to learning and developmental problems , asthma , lower iqs , she says
@entity161 : after decades , @entity19 set mercury and toxin emission standards
if @entity92 votes to kill limits , she says , water , air and kids will continue to be poisoned
