-- @entity1 and @entity2 may still be the players to beat on the women 's circuit while @entity6 has enjoyed a recent renaissance on the men 's tour but strip away this illustrious trio and there are real fears for the future of @entity15 tennis			1
@entity6 remains the only @entity15 male in the top 10 of the @entity19 rankings , with @entity20 and @entity22 solid performers in the 20s			1
on the @entity24 , @entity1 and @entity2 are at no. 1 and @entity25 but then there is a gap to promising teenager @entity28 at 36 , with three other women occupying spots in the lower reaches of the top 100			1
for a nation with the tennis pedigree of the @entity15 , and with its three standard bearers in their late 20s , it is a worrying trend which @entity6 says is a product of the talent pool in the @entity15 being diluted			1
are @entity41 's rivals pretenders to the throne ? " i think our best athletes probably get spread out across 10 or 12 different sports , " he told @entity0 in an exclusive interview			2
" where in @entity47 -- with the success of @entity49 ( @entity50 ) and the other girls on tour and guy players too			2
it 's kind of become the sport there			0
" their best athletes -- have been funneled into tennis			2
in the @entity15 -- i feel like it 's funneled into football , baseball , and basketball			2
there are so many different options that it might water down the talent pool for a given sport , " he added			2
@entity69 , whose famous tennis academy has produced the likes of @entity72 and @entity73 , agrees with @entity6			1
" look you have cheerleading , you have basketball , you have lacrosse , you have basketball , football , you have everything , " he told @entity0			0
" you have marathons , running , we have a variety of things			0
i believe you have to go for one sport and dedicate your life to it and also have some talent			2
" @entity69 also believes the worldwide growth of tennis with many more countries now producing top - ranked players is responsible for the relative decline in @entity15 standards			1
" let 's go back to the 80 's and 90 's			0
basically there were six countries playing and we certainly we were right up on top and if you look at the world today you have @entity103 -- unbelievable ladies and @entity105 , you have @entity106 , the @entity107 , you have @entity47 , you have everybody playing , " he said			2
@entity69 also questions the failure of @entity15 tennis to discover talent at grassroots level from working class backgrounds			1
" how many of the kids playing today come from poor families ? how many have come from the inner city where there is a possibility they can be somebody ? it is very difficult today in @entity15 to get players to commit , " he added			1
in response to the problem , the @entity124 ( @entity124 ) has charged @entity127 with developing its elite young players , combining this role with captaining their @entity131 team			1
@entity127 , whose brother @entity132 topped the world rankings in the 1980s , agrees with @entity6 about the attractions of other sports , but is not going to make it an excuse for failure			1
" we 've got to do a better job , " he told @entity0			0
" we need to find those players and train them more systematically			2
" he says he has been given sufficient funding and resources by the @entity124 , but says no amount of money can develop a grand slam winner if the talent is not there			0
" i 'm not sure you could create a champion			0
i 'm not sure that 's possible , but i think you can create an environment where you will get a lot of really good players , hopefully if you do that , you will get the @entity1 , the @entity156			0
@entity157 , the last @entity15 man to top the world rankings , has no doubt the @entity124 made the right choice in selecting @entity127 to his role two years ago			1
" @entity127 is a good friend , a great @entity131 captain and a solid ambassador for the sport of tennis			1
i wish him nothing but the best and will help in any way i can , " he told the @entity124 official web site			0
despite the support for @entity127 , the flow of young @entity15 talent onto the professional circuit remains a trickle rather than the hoped for flood			1
current hopes are the @entity178 , 17 - year - old @entity179 and his younger brother @entity180 , who are both at the @entity181			0
@entity179 became the third - youngest player to win an @entity19 match at 15 and @entity69 believes he has the talent to make it to the top from his current ranking in the mid 200s			1
" he certainly has the ingredients and that is what this academy does			0
it provides the basis and then it is up to you and how you want to compete and if you can deal with competition , " he added			0
despite the talent of the likes of the @entity178 and more established young players such as @entity28 and @entity20 , @entity69 does not believe that future success is guaranteed			1
" @entity201 has got a tough job , not impossible but he is the one who is going to have to go out , get all the good coaches , support them and get the good players with the good players and work with the colleges			0
" but you are still going to have to seek out the hungry athletes , " he added			0
in the meantime , @entity6 , who scored a superb victory in the @entity211 100 tournament recently , is hoping that @entity20 and @entity22 can step up to the plate to give him some support in the upper echelons of the world game			1
" i 've been real excited that @entity22 and @entity132 have been playing well			0
i 'm certainly always welcome to have some home company in the top ten or so , " he said .			0
