-- the attorney for the family of slain @entity3 , @entity4 , teenager @entity5 is coming down hard a local newspaper , accusing the @entity7 of reporting " gossip and racist speculation " instead of news surrounding the 18 - year - old 's death			1
attorney @entity13 is upset about the newspaper 's pursuit of juvenile records on @entity5 , accusing its reporters of failing to apply the same zeal to obtaining background information on the police officer who killed @entity5 , @entity21			1
" in this new age , where there is a war being waged for clicks and eyeballs , it appears the post-dispatch has chosen to forgo its duty to report facts and provide meaningful context and has instead opted to pursue gossip and racist speculation , " @entity13 said in an open letter to the newspaper 's editor			1
" this is deeply disappointing			0
" telephone messages and emails from @entity0 to the newspaper 's public relations office and editor were not immediately returned friday afternoon			0
@entity5 died on august 9 in an encounter with @entity21 that set off days of sometimes violent protests in the @entity7 suburb			1
the @entity5 family believes the teenager was unfairly killed			0
@entity21 has not publicly given a statement , but police have said the two struggled over the officer 's gun			2
race has been at the heart of the case			0
@entity5 was black , like two - thirds of his neighbors in @entity3			0
@entity21 is white , like most of the city 's police department			0
@entity5 shooting : is new video a ' game changer ' ? @entity13 's letter follows a decision tuesday by a @entity65 judge to deny the newspaper 's request to obtain any juvenile court records related to @entity5			1
judge @entity70 did not explain her decision , the newspaper reported			0
a juvenile court official later told reporters that @entity5 had never been found delinquent on juvenile charges that would equate to the state 's most serious felonies and was not facing any such charges at the time of his death			2
that revelation , the @entity7 said tuesday , " put to rest claims by a @entity82 - based blog and others that @entity5 was facing a murder charge at the time he was shot to death			2
" however , @entity13 said the newspaper continued to press the case despite statements by police and in court that @entity5 was facing no charges			1
after @entity5 's death , police controversially issued documents alleging that he was a suspect in the theft of cigars from a convenience store shortly before he died , but he was not charged in that incident			2
meanwhile , @entity13 said , the @entity7 " has n't offered us a single new fact on @entity21 's behavior as a police officer			1
" " where is the petition for his employment records ? why stop there ? where are the lawsuits in pursuit of his employment records , police reports , memos and e-mails for the city and county police ? " @entity13 wrote .			0

attorney @entity13 says the newspaper has been *biased* in its quest for records
@entity13 says the @entity7 has n't *dug* into officer @entity21 's past
but it has chased @entity5 's juvenile records , he says
he accuses the newspaper of pursuing " gossip and racist speculation "
