-- you might be planning a weekend camping trip with your family or friends			2
as you stuff your car with all the necessary equipment , take a moment to reflect on the fascinating history of some of those must - have camping accessories			1
duffel bag while rucksacks have been around for hundreds ( if not thousands ) of years , they were usually made from animal skins or wool , which only did so much to protect contents from the harsh elements			2
but @entity19 and @entity20 sailors of the early 17th century hit on a better solution			1
they found that bags made from the leftover scraps of fabric used to repair a ship 's sails did a fine job against rain and seawater			1
this coarse , sturdy , waterproof material was imported from its one supplier in the town of @entity33 , @entity34			2
flashlight when d cell batteries became commercially available in 1896 , it opened the door for all kinds of battery - powered inventions			1
one was the " electrical hand torch , " introduced in 1898 by the @entity42 and @entity43 , which would later change its name to @entity45			2
the first lights were paper and fiber tubes , with a carbon filament bulb covered by a lens on one end , two d batteries inside , and a metal ring on the side			1
pressing down on the ring caused it to hit two metal poles -- one positive and one negative -- which completed the electrical connection , lighting up the bulb			2
early batteries were quite weak , though , so the light only came on in brief flashes before going out again , which is how they got their nickname , " flashlights			1
" heavy use of the light also meant that it had to be " rested " so that the batteries could recharge			1
still , it was much better than carrying a candle that could go out , a lantern that had to be refilled with oil , and , more importantly , there was no chance of starting a fire			2
as battery and filament technologies improved , the flashlights could stay on for minutes at a time , but the name had already become synonymous , so it stuck ( in @entity79 and @entity80 anyway ; the rest of the world still calls them " torches " )			1
while the lights were fairly popular , sales really skyrocketed in 1898 when @entity87 donated their new and improved metal flashlights to the @entity89			1
when officers reported how useful the lights were in their duties , these testimonies were included in the company 's product catalog , adding weight to the quality and usefulness of the brand			2
@entity99 : the origin of the @entity101 3			2
sleeping bag the modern sleeping bag was influenced by a number of different sources			0
in the 1850s , @entity107 officials who patrolled the mountains had a knapsack bag made of sheepskin and lined with wool that could be rolled up and buckled in place , then carried with shoulder straps			0
then , in 1861 , @entity117 explorer @entity115 tested a prototype sleeping bag made from a blanket with a waterproof rubber bottom			0
both of these designs were little more than an open - ended man - sized bag , so getting in and out for a late - night bathroom break was a bit of a hassle , but it got the job done			1
a more convenient design came from @entity132 inventor and father of the mail order business model , @entity135			0
in 1876 , he introduced the @entity137			0
the rug consisted of a wool blanket with an off - center pocket at the top for a sewn - in , inflatable , rubber pillow			1
once inside , you folded the blanket over and fastened it together to keep you snug as a bug			0
@entity146 , as he called himself , had produced 60,000 rugs exclusively for the @entity149 ; many were used in the @entity151 during the @entity152			0
however , when the city fell , the @entity153 canceled the rest of their order , leaving @entity157 with 17,000 rugs left undelivered			0
he quickly added the @entity137 to his catalog and sold it as an inexpensive bedding solution for charities working with the poor			0
the rug caught on , and it was soon being used by the @entity165 and @entity166 camping in the @entity167 , too			0
no known examples of the @entity137 exist today , but in 2010 , the @entity169 commissioned a replica made from the original patent as part of a special tv series called " @entity174			0
" they donated the recreation to a museum in @entity178 in @entity132 , where @entity135 lived			0
air mattress the first air mattress was invented in 1889 by the @entity181 in @entity182 , @entity183			1
surprisingly , the design of the mattress has remained virtually unchanged over the last 120 years , closely resembling the standard air mattress used for lounging in the swimming pool today			1
the rubber mattresses were originally produced as an alternative to hair - filled mattresses on @entity192 steamships because they could be deflated and stowed easily , and could even be used as a life raft if needed			1
the mattresses ' easy storage was also a big selling point for landlubbers who , in the early part of the 20th century , moved out of the country and into one - room city apartments where space was limited			1
to sell their inflatable mattress , the company offered a 30 - day trial period , a tactic still used today by many mattress retailers			1
if you did n't love your pneumatic mattress , you could return it for a full refund of $ 22 for the adult version , or $ 11 for the baby crib - sized version			2
@entity99 : how @entity214 got @entity216 's hair 5			2
@entity218 tool ask any outdoorsman , farmer , @entity221 , computer technician or soldier to give up his @entity224 and you 'll likely be told , " you can pry it from my cold , dead hands			0
" fans of the handy gadget are dedicated to the multi-tool thanks to its compact size , versatility , and quality construction			0
but just what is a " @entity236 " anyway ? is it a nickname given to rough and tumble mountain men in the 19th century ? maybe they were soldiers that were part of a special brigade that fought in the @entity243 ? nope			1
his name 's @entity245 when @entity236 , a mechanical engineer , and his wife were traveling through @entity251 in 1975 , their rented @entity247 kept breaking down			1
@entity236 was pretty handy , but he found that his old @entity253 knife , which had a couple of blades , a can opener , and a flat head screwdriver , simply was n't enough tool to keep the old car running			1
so , using cardboard cutouts , and then later making a metal prototype in his garage workshop , he developed what he called a " multi-tool " that he thought would change the world			0
unfortunately , the world was n't too impressed			0
@entity236 tried to sell the idea to knife companies , but they said it was more like a tool			1
tool companies said it was n't a tool , but a " gadget , " so they were n't interested , either			0
@entity236 eventually decided to make and sell the @entity236 on his own , but still could n't find anyone to carry it in their stores			1
finally , in 1983 , he convinced a mail - order catalog to sell his " sportsmen " multi-tool			2
@entity236 had the resources to produce as many as 4,000 @entity236 multi-tools			1
he received 30,000 orders in his first year			0
@entity286 if starting a campfire is n't your strong suit , it never hurts to have some @entity286 , the flammable gel in a can , within reach			0
this " canned heat " has been around since 1893 and takes its unusual name from the company 's founder , @entity296			0
the product really hit its stride during @entity301 , when the @entity302 ran a marketing campaign suggesting soldiers going to @entity251 could use @entity286 to heat water and rations , sterilize surgical instruments , and provide light and warmth in the cold , dark trenches			0
soon , just about every doughboy had a few cans in his duffel bag			0
