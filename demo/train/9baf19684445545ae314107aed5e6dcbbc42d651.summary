" dangerous , " " @entity0 " -- " innocent people who might get injured or killed			2
" that 's how @entity4 justices characterized the consequences of a motorist fleeing police in a high - speed chase that ended violently			1
every justice who spoke at a tense oral argument on tuesday seemed inclined to support three @entity13 police officers who opened fire on a runaway motorist , killing the driver and his passenger			1
the case involves an appeal that again tests the limits of split - second law enforcement discretion for using deadly force			1
the incident in question began in july 2004 , when police in @entity26 , @entity13 , questioned @entity27 at a gas station about a broken light on his white @entity30			2
he refused to step out the car and then took off			2
with his girlfriend , @entity34 , in the passenger seat , @entity27 crossed the @entity36 into @entity37 along @entity38			0
mounted cameras from three police vehicles , led by officer @entity41 , show @entity27 weaving in and out of traffic , then ramming a police car head - on			1
the @entity30 is later surrounded and as the suspect tries to back up , he sideswipes another cop car , and almost strikes one of the officers			1
the video then captures police firing 15 point - blank shots into the vehicle , as it drives away			2
the car then goes airborne and slams into a house in @entity26			2
@entity27 and @entity34 , both 44 , were killed			2
@entity27 's family sued police , who argue they 're immune from such legal action			1
courts struggle with interpretation the @entity4 has previously said law enforcement and government officials are generally shielded from " liability for civil damages " unless their conduct is egregious			1
but state and federal courts have struggled with a broad application for high - speed pursuits , especially of those not implicated in a criminal offense			2
at arguments , justice @entity71 , constantly pushed the lawyer for @entity27 's ' family to demonstrate whether the law was clearly established to show the officers ' actions were unreasonable			2
" we are still left with a very dangerous man careening down the road , who is surrounded by police cars and still tries to get away to continue his careening , " said @entity71			0
it was " your client who caused the whole thing , who caused the shooting in the last analysis			0
" during the high court 's public look at the case , it was clear the police version of the facts held sway			1
the car " is eventually surrounded by officers with guns pointed at the driver demanding that he get out , that he put his hands up , and stop driving			1
they are pounding on the windows of the car			0
and the driver then begins to drive away , " said justice @entity104			0
" what do reasonable officers do ? maybe what they should do is to continue the chase indefinitely			1
" @entity27 " has already gone 100 miles an hour when the car moved away , even though that part of the street was deserted , " said justice @entity109			0
" why would a reasonable officer not be suspicious that more reckless driving is going to occur ? " standard of misconduct the family 's attorney , @entity116 , suggested @entity27 may not have been trying to continue the chase when eventually surrounded by police			1
" you ca n't tell because he is bumper to bumper with the ( officer @entity124 ) @entity123 's car , " said @entity116			0
" it is true that the wheels spin forward			0
" " what do you mean ? he is going to the police station ? " asked justice @entity129 skeptically			0
justice @entity132 tried to give @entity116 rhetorical room to make his point but said the " clearly established " standard of misconduct was not met			0
" when i saw the film , i saw your point			0
but what i ca n't quite see is how it was a clearly established " violation , he said			0
" so i 'm left in this uncertainty , which unfortunately for you means it was n't clearly established			0
" justice @entity146 wondered whether the fact 15 shots were fired , and that there was a passenger involved should be taken into account in the fact - specific inquiry			0
chief justice @entity154 pursued a similar line of questioning : " is there any situation in which the application of lethal force during a high - speed case in your view would not be justified ? " an @entity165 reference the attorney for the officers reluctantly cited the low - speed pursuit of former football star @entity165 , suspected of murdering his wife and her friend in 1994			1
" i hate to use television as an example , but perhaps the way the white @entity175 fled in the early ' 90s that everybody saw on tv , " said @entity173			0
" that seemed to be relatively non-dangerous or at least not a danger of serious physical injury			0
" the @entity182 administration is supporting the officers in the @entity185 case			1
the high court has been down this legal road before , ruling in 2007 a @entity189 police officer used " reasonable force " when ramming a young speeding motorist off the road , leaving him a paraplegic			1
that 8 - 1 opinion gave law enforcement significant protection from similar lawsuits , even when no other serious felonies surrounding the chase may have been committed			1
that was the first time the high court heard a case involving deadly force in police chases , and lower federal appeals courts have been split on the issue			1
under generally applied @entity4 precedents , an officer must show a suspect poses a " significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others " before using deadly force			1
but some judges have since concluded that officers can be stripped of qualified immunity from lawsuits , citing the incident - specific , subjective circumstances unique to each pursuit			0
impact on police law enforcement groups worry a ruling against @entity41 would hamstring every police official , who would often have to make split - second decisions about whether to wait until someone gets hurt -- including innocent victims or the officer himself -- before they could stop escaping motorists			1
many police departments have specific policies about when to chase and when to hold back , but there are no national statistics on how jurisdictions handle such situations			1
a 2004 study by the @entity240 showed 260 to 325 people were killed in high - speed crashes involving police , from 1994 to 2002			2
while @entity27 's family may not prevail , the larger question was whether the high court will now address the constitutional concerns , and give law enforcement around the country clearer guidelines on the proper line for use of deadly force			0
a ruling is expected within three months			0
the case is @entity41 v. @entity27 ( 12 - 1117 ) .			0

case involves motorist who led police on chase following minor traffic stop
