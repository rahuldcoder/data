@entity0 -- a repeal of president @entity6 's signature health care law is " not gon na happen " even if the @entity7 takes the @entity8 , @entity3 gov. @entity2 said			1
the @entity7 governor 's comments , in an interview with the @entity12 published monday , are a major departure from the rest of his party -- and stunning for a potential 2016 presidential contender			1
" the opposition to it was really either political or ideological , " @entity2 said of @entity17			0
" i do n't think that holds water against real flesh and blood , and real improvements in people 's lives			0
" the governor later reversed course on @entity29 , saying the @entity12 " got it wrong " and that he wants to " repeal and replace " @entity17			0
a @entity2 spokesman said the governor was referring solely to @entity17 's @entity35 expansion -- not the entire law -- and that his comments were reported out of context			1
@entity2 angered conservatives when he bypassed @entity3 's @entity7 - controlled legislature and embraced @entity17 's @entity35 expansion last year			1
his comments reflect the political balancing act facing @entity7 governors who criticized the law but have implemented parts or all of it			2
@entity48 gov. @entity47 has sought a middle ground , arguing for a version of the @entity35 expansion that includes changes such as individual health savings accounts requiring personal contributions -- a program initially crafted under his predecessor , @entity56			0
others @entity7 governors seen as prospective presidential candidates , like @entity62 's @entity61 and @entity64 's @entity63 , have been outspoken opponents of @entity17 , refusing to implement it and saying they 'd like to see it repealed			2
in states that have expanded @entity35 , @entity68 @entity8 candidates like @entity69 in @entity70 have pressed their @entity7 opponents about what would happen to the hundreds of thousands of low - income residents who now have health coverage			1
" we have over a half a million @entity80 who for the first time ever are filling prescriptions , they 're going to the doctor , they 're getting checkups , " @entity69 said in a recent debate with @entity78 leader @entity78			0
" i will not be a senator that rips that insurance from their hands			0
