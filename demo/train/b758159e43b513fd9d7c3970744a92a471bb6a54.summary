-- even though he sailed to the @entity2 on the wings of his soaring rhetoric , president @entity1 could find that he is on mission impossible as he launches his media blitz on @entity7 this week -- six television interviews on monday and a dramatic prime time address on tuesday			1
perhaps he will persuade a skeptical public , but it is surely the toughest speaking assignment of his presidency			2
surprisingly , he is now tripling down on his @entity7 bet			1
first he drew the red line , uncertain whether president @entity17 would call his bluff			2
then he doubled down by insisting on a vote from an unreliable @entity20			0
now he is placing almost all his chips on the table by betting on his capacity to turn around public opinion			2
if he wins over the public , he will likely win @entity20 , too , but if he fails , he will have turned a problem in @entity7 into a crisis in his presidency			1
( someday , in their memoirs , will @entity2 insiders please tell us what they were thinking ? ) there are at least two major hurdles in his path as he seeks to persuade the public			1
first , he will be trying to change opinion that has already started to harden against him			0
second , the bully pulpit may not be as powerful as often imagined			1
the intensity factor it 's hard to remember a public terrain as rough as this one for a president in the past few decades			1
weary of war and wary of another , @entity43 are in no mood to rally behind this call to arms -- many do n't see it as our fight , they worry that it will drag us in deeper and even some of his most ardent supporters think the president and his team do n't have a firm grip on the wheel			1
a @entity61 poll late this past week found that a majority of the public ( 51 % to 36 % ) is opposed to a @entity7 strike			1
that is the lowest level of support @entity61 has found for any intervention in two decades			2
moreover , the " intensity factor " runs much more strongly among opponents -- just look at the avalanche of their calls and e-mails to @entity73			2
the president has been arguing his case for nearly three weeks , and so far , he does n't have many converts on the @entity78			0
that 's among @entity80 as well as @entity81			0
@entity0 's whip count suggests that he could win a tight vote in the @entity85 ( his speech may work best there ) , but a strike resolution is in serious trouble in the @entity2			1
the @entity91 count shows that as many as a third of @entity2 @entity80 may vote no. even overseas , among nations much closer to @entity7 , the president 's rhetorical offensive has fallen short			1
no president in modern times has had such a tiny coalition behind him			0
eighteen nations contributed to the intervention in @entity101			0
president @entity102 had 48 nations in the coalition that attacked @entity105			0
this time around , @entity1 will have only a handful supporting his intervention and most will be cheering from the sidelines			1
a shaky pulpit this controversy is also coming at an inopportune moment for the president			1
early on at the @entity2 , he could command massive , almost adoring audiences at every major address			1
but with the exception of his speech announcing the killing of @entity121 , the numbers tuning in have dropped , viewers tend to be more partisan and television commentators have toughened up on him			0
notably , his two @entity7 interviews on television so far have drawn only modest audiences			1
it has been little noticed but is important now that @entity1 has also had more success selling himself than his policies			1
@entity1 's speeches -- despite their rhetorical strength and skilled delivery -- have had little success in moving his agenda forward			2
@entity43 still like him , but they tend to make up their own minds about his policies			0
witness his inability , even now , to build a public majority in favor of @entity140			0
the @entity2 would argue that a majority have supported his stands on gun control and gay rights , but is that because of his speeches or because of demographic shifts and events such as the @entity149 elementary school massacre ? indeed , there is now a debate among political scientists whether the bully pulpit is all that it is cracked up to be , especially in contemporary politics			1
professor @entity155 of @entity156 and a dean among political scientists concluded in his 2006 book , " on deaf ears : the @entity163 of the @entity164 , " that we have a highly inflated view of how much presidents have been able to change public minds through their speeches			0
he presents numerous cases to support his argument and one that is especially relevant today : president @entity170 had a legendary ability to connect with @entity43 through his fireside chats , but when it came to convincing a skeptical public about his @entity176 - packing bill in his second term , the fire fizzled out			1
@entity155 ' data also suggests that presidents only succeed in mobilizing the public when opinion is already in their favor			0
this is clearly not the case with @entity7			2
to our memory , the last @entity186 address that dramatically moved the public opinion needle over military conflict came in late 1983 when president @entity191 spoke to the country about a bloody attack on marine barracks in @entity195 and @entity43 intervention in the tiny island of @entity198			1
public support for military action jumped 10 points in immediate polling			0
but in that case , @entity191 was telling a story about what had already happened to a public whose majority already favored intervention			2
he was not asking them to rally round a new , uncertain venture , and he was also still in his first term when audiences were big			0
this is not to argue that all is lost for @entity1 on tuesday night			2
big speeches can reframe issues			0
they can unite us behind a higher purpose			0
they can push us to question our firmly held beliefs			0
@entity1 does have unusually persuasive powers			1
perhaps he can come up with fresh arguments that will bring undecideds in his direction			0
perhaps he will have horrific new evidence of how brutal @entity17 is			0
perhaps ... perhaps , but if he has new arrows in his quiver , he likely would have shot them by now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 and @entity232			2

@entity234 , @entity232 : rarely has a president faced as tough a public mood as does @entity1
they say he has ability to get people to like him but may not be persuasive on @entity7
*authors* : public mood seems strongly against intervention
*researchers* say the impact of the @entity2 " bully pulpit " has been *exaggerated*
