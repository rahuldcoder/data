-- coverage for 30 million uninsured			0
a ban on lifetime payout limits			0
no co-pays or deductibles on preventive medical services			2
insurers prohibited from excluding patients based on pre-existing medical conditions			0
the @entity11 ( also known as " @entity11 " ) creates a massive , wide - scale overhaul of the heavily flawed and criticized health care system of the @entity14			2
but for all of the @entity18 administration 's work in creating this 906 - page federal law , there is one glaring omission that could decrease the costs of health care and help relieve the upcoming physician shortage			2
how could the @entity18 administration create such a comprehensive overhaul of health care without addressing this issue ? although not a panacea for the health problems in the @entity14 , the need for physicians to practice defensive medicine in order to avoid potential litigation has far - reaching consequences			1
a 2008 survey of @entity39 doctors found that 83 % admitted to practicing defensive medicine			1
this study determined that 18 % to 28 % of tests , procedures and referrals and 13 % of hospital admissions were performed for the sake of avoiding lawsuits			0
in this one state alone , an estimated $ 281 million in unnecessary physician costs and more than $ 1 billion in excessive hospital costs was due to the practice of defensive medicine			1
across the country , doctors are ordering tests and consultations as a way to protect themselves from potential liability			2
in our litigation - obsessed culture , the costs for doctors to purchase liability insurance can be astronomical			1
according to the @entity67 , in 2011 , general surgeons in @entity66 's @entity65 paid $ 190,000 per year for malpractice insurance			1
general internists in @entity70 paid approximately $ 35,000 per year for coverage			0
it 's a well - known fact that family medicine physicians and even obstetrician - gynecologists are giving up the practice of obstetrics because of the excessive cost of malpractice insurance and the fear of potential lawsuits			1
malpractice fees break @entity83 - @entity82 even if physicians purchase malpractice insurance , it 's no guarantee that , should they get sued , they will not lose virtually everything they have			1
the maximum coverage most malpractice insurance carriers will offer a physician is $ 1 million per lawsuit			1
that means any verdict greater than this limit comes out of the doctor 's pocket			2
in today 's climate of multimillion - dollar verdicts , one lawsuit could be financially devastating			1
a physician can work 30 years , healing and saving the lives of thousands of patients , yet one mistake at the end of his or her career could literally cost them everything			0
is that right ? under this type of hostile litigious climate , why would n't physicians order that extra test , keep their patients in the hospital that extra night or refer for a second opinion ? as a board - certified plastic and reconstructive surgeon , i 'm aware of this every day			0
a recent study found that plastic surgeons have a 99 % chance of getting sued by the time they reach age 65			0
does the fear of missing a diagnosis and getting sued cause me to order more tests and referrals for my patients ? definitely			0
opinion : doctors and patients should talk more , test less so why has n't the @entity18 administration included medical liability reform in the @entity11 ? i suspect that it comes down to dollars			1
not health care dollars or insurance dollars but campaign donation dollars			0
according to @entity145 , since 1990 , the @entity144 , previously known as the @entity144 , has given 92 % of its $ 36.8 million in contributions to @entity147			0
the association is also a large contributor to president @entity18 's re-election campaign			0
it is opposed to malpractice tort reform , for obvious reasons , and i suspect that it may have played a significant role in the absence of malpractice liability reform in the @entity11			1
in a 2009 speech to @entity159 , @entity18 stated that he " talked to enough doctors to know that defensive medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs			1
" with the cost of health care continuing to rise , it 's a shame his @entity11 does n't include a provision addressing this			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			0

" @entity11 " does not address medical liability reform
doctors practice " defensive medicine " to avoid potential litigation
malpractice insurance costs can be astronomical for some
one multimillion - dollar verdict can cause a doctor to lose everything
