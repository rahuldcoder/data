-- here 's a @entity2 's resolution that 's easy to keep , good for your health and beneficial for your relationships			1
and it wo n't cost you a penny			2
sound too good to be true ? read on			1
in recent months , i 've been working with a group of creative thinkers who are mining the meaning of a good life			1
@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 are renowned psychologists who 've collaborated to create the @entity18 , which explores the behaviors and mindsets that add up to good work , good play and good citizenship			1
together , with @entity25 , we 've developed a simple set of questions for the @entity2			1
they 're catalysts for reflection rather than formulas for imitation			1
their purpose is to get us thinking about our purpose , in both private and community life			1
we originally developed these questions for young people , on the belief that the new generation does n't get enough structured opportunities to explore meaning and values			1
but the truth is , it 's not just millennials today who might lack purpose , feel uncertain about shared beliefs and goals or wish they could be part of something greater than themselves			1
it 's people of all ages			1
we @entity58 rarely get to make a truly mindful assessment of who we are , what 's shaped us and why we hope to change			1
if we did that first , we 'd probably be more capable of making wise resolutions and keeping them			0
we 'd become more conscious of the web of relationship and mutual obligation that holds us together and that makes our freedom truly worth cherishing			0
and we might just end up being better humans			0
so i invite you , whatever your stage of life , to explore these questions			1
talk with family and friends about them			0
write and share your reflections			0
feel free to adapt and revise the questions to suit your circumstances			2
and let us know on @entity82 what the experience is like for you and those close to you			0
if you make it your first resolution to consider these questions well , your other resolutions will almost certainly end up being more honest , more meaningful to you and more useful to others			2
enjoy reflecting , and may your new year be happy -- and deeply good			2
think of something ( an activity , a job ) to which you 're really committed and that takes up a lot of your time			2
why do you do it ? do you consider it time well spent ? why or why not ? what would make you stop being involved ? 2			0
who or what do you consider your community ? what do you do for the community ? what would you expect the community to do it for you ? 3			0
to whom or what do you feel responsible ? what does that entail ? what happens when you do n't meet that responsibility ? 4			0
are you a good worker ? a good citizen ? a good person ? how do you distinguish among them ? which is most important to you ? influences 5			1
who 's influenced you , and how do you pass it on ? 6			2
what individuals and institutions do you admire and why ( current or past ) ? 7			0
what / whom do n't you admire and why ? 8			0
what and whom do you love ? aspirations 9			2
what would it mean for you to be successful ? how important is recognition , through money or esteem ? what about unheralded acts or contributions ? 10			0
what would it mean for you fail ? who or what will make that judgment for you and about you ? 11			0
what kind of person do you want to be right now ? 12			0
what should -- and should n't -- be written in your obituary ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149 .			1
