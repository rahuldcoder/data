-- @entity1 -- formerly of @entity2 , formerly of @entity3 , formerly of @entity4 , formerly of @entity5 -- wants back in the game			1
more to the point , he wants to return to his sports roots by reuniting with @entity5			1
now it would be easy to torpedo that idea by noting that @entity1 has burned bridges everywhere he has worked and could inflame things back at @entity5			1
instead , i 'm going to lead a chant : @entity15 ! ! it would be great fun to see him holding forth again on sporting matters			0
is the guy supposed to stay sidelined for the rest of his life , just because he 's got a bit of a temper ? do n't the fans of @entity26 deserve better ? watch : did @entity27 lay a glove on @entity29 ? the @entity30 reports that @entity1 recently had dinner with @entity5 's president , @entity32 , who says they had a fine time			1
but they were n't just shooting the breeze : " clearly he was looking to see if there was an entry point to come back , " @entity32 said			0
@entity1 , in turn , praised @entity32 's " vision and charm			1
" so to put it in betting terms , what are the odds ? " there was no real appropriate place for @entity1 to come back , nor did i feel like i was prepared to bring him back , " @entity32 told the @entity30			1
@entity5 is in the business of covering athletic competition , right ? what could be more spellbinding than waiting to see whether @entity1 declares some jock the " worst person in the world " or , even better , grabs a baseball bat in some confrontation with the bosses ? watch : do @entity57 and @entity58 get why he lost the election ? i 'm being facetious , of course			1
but i miss the guy , even though there have been times when he has thrown brushback pitches at me			0
but i 'm going to rise above that , for the greater good of television			0
the thing about ubertalented people is that they 're often difficult to manage			0
@entity1 is a great broadcaster , but sometimes he lets his anger get the best of him			1
he makes life very difficult for his bosses			0
the question , as always , is whether he 's worth it			2
@entity1 worked for @entity5 from 1992 to 1997 , so he can claim , you know , it 's a new century and all that			1
he and @entity79 were a very popular team as co-hosts of " @entity82			0
" but then @entity1 left , prompting an @entity5 executive to offer this classic quote : " he did n't burn bridges here			1
" watch : @entity88 doubles down on street talk about @entity91 's backside abandoning sports for politics , @entity1 hosted " @entity99 " on @entity2 , riding the @entity96 / @entity95 wave to prominence until he quit , saying he was " ashamed " of what he was doing			1
next up was @entity101 , where @entity1 worked for three years			2
he 's crazy , " owner @entity103 later said			0
@entity1 has always blamed @entity104 for his departure			2
after a brief stint at @entity0 , where he had also worked early in his career , @entity1 headed back to @entity2 and almost single - handedly revived the channel			2
tapping into a surge of sentiment against president @entity112 during the @entity114 war , @entity1 's " countdown " redefined @entity2 as cable 's leading liberal outlet and boosted its ratings for eight years			1
but clashes with management grew			0
he was briefly suspended over making political donations , and the two sides severed their relationship			0
@entity1 resurfaced with a $ 10 - million - a - year deal at @entity3 , boasting about his independence from corporate media as @entity127 gave him the title of chief news officer			1
but the marriage quickly soured , with @entity1 complaining about the cheesiness of the facilities ( " a daily logistical nightmare " that " more closely resembles cable access , " according to an e-mail from his rep ) and management complaining about temper tantrums , a mug - throwing incident and days off			2
after less than a year , the two sides wound up suing each other last spring			0
now you might say this is a cautionary note for a future employer , and you might be right			0
but after a year of unemployment and tweeting mainly about sports , perhaps @entity1 has mellowed			1
watch : should @entity145 have suggested pope @entity146 is gay ? to be sure , @entity5 has certainly tolerated its share of loudmouths , from the analyst who was let go for calling @entity152 quarterback @entity151 a " cornball brother " to the commentator who uttered the n - word on the air			2
@entity1 's problems tend to unfold off the field , not in front of the camera , though he 's occasionally apologized for going too far			1
and it could n't hurt for @entity5 to jazz things up			2
@entity32 is n't exactly raising expectations , saying : " there are not that many successful examples of people who have come back , in part because it 's like water filling a vacuum			0
when somebody leaves , somebody else fills their place			0
" sure , play it safe			0
or throw the long pass and see what happens			0
remember : watching @entity1 is a great spectator sport			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			2

@entity181 : there 's talk that @entity1 wants to return to @entity5
he says @entity1 has been *controversial* at several leading media outlets
@entity181 says @entity1 has great talent and deserves another shot at sports
@entity181 : working with @entity1 may not always be easy , but he can be worth the trouble
