-- @entity2 fishermen have taken the offensive in their fight against the owner of the stricken @entity7 power plant , angrily calling the utility 's actions insulting , incompetent and " unforgivable " over the course of the weeks - long nuclear crisis			1
the @entity12 , a trade group for @entity2 's fishing industry , issued a scathing statement on wednesday just hours after meeting with officials from the @entity16 , which runs the crippled plant			1
in it , the group demanded that the utility and @entity2 government " compensate all parties ( that have ) indirectly or directly suffered " as a result of the situation			1
" @entity16 has not been capable of understanding the damage at the plant and ( contaminated ) water			1
that led to this serious situation , " the group said in the statement			0
" @entity16 and the government ( share ) responsibility for this situation			2
it is unforgivable , " the message continues			0
" all those who are living and sustaining their lives on the sea are feeling strong rage against ( the utility and the government 's ) irresponsible behavior			1
" members of the fishing group said they are particularly angry about the decision made and enacted monday to dump 11,500 tons of radioactive water into the @entity47			1
this happened just hours after the group specifically requested it not be done -- leaving its members feeling ignored			2
besides that complaint , fishery association representatives blasted @entity16 's claim that nuclear power plants were safe and that such accidents would never happen			1
an official from the utility company said @entity16 officials offered apologies and vowed to improve the situation			1
this was shortly after they confirmed , early wednesday , that one leak outside the no. 2 reactor , through which water that had radiation levels millions of times the legal limit , was rushing into the sea			1
mincing no words , the fishing industry demanded as much -- saying that stopping leaks of contaminated water into the sea was needed " to prevent the death of the fishing industry			2
" " we demand that @entity16 and the government react to all the problems provoked by this outrageous decision ( to dump radioactive water in the sea ) and flush out highly contaminated water " now in the ocean , the association said in its statement said			1
@entity2 chief cabinet secretary @entity87 on wednesday apologized for how the government had communicated why the dump of radioactive water was necessary			1
he explained that it contained 1/200,000ths the level of radiation as that in and around the no. 2 reactor , one of six at the nuclear plant , and that authorities decided to clear out the less radioactive liquid in order to make room in a waste water treatment facility			2
" so it was a measure to prevent more serious marine contamination , " the @entity2 official said			1
" but we needed to explain the reasoning better to the people ( impacted by it )			0
" whatever the radiation level , @entity110 , chair of the radiation safety committee at @entity112 , explained that this dumped water should quickly dilute considering it is equivalent to dumping five swimming pools worth of water into a @entity47 that has roughly " 300 trillion swimming pools full of water			0
" still , @entity2 authorities have noted higher - than - normal radiation levels in some young eels			2
and in addition to its impact on aquatic life directly , some fear the mere possibility of radiation in seafood may deter consumers domestically and abroad from eating products that originated in waters off @entity2			2
citing such " rumors , " @entity87 said tuesday that authorities will step up the monitoring of radiation in seafood , partly in a bid to assure the public that whatever gets on the market is safe			0
the new @entity2 government standards will rely upon enforcement by city and town health inspectors , not those with the prefectures , according to @entity87			0
as with milk and vegetables , certain fish can be removed from the restricted list if levels of radiation come in below the legal limits for three weeks in a row			0
as to the fishermen themselves , the cabinet minister said wednesday that , in addition to a larger compensation package to be decided upon later , the government is considering a preemptive payout			0
similar payments will likely go to farmers , who have been explicitly affected by the nuclear crisis much longer than those in the fishing industry			1
@entity2 first imposed restrictions on the sale and distribution of milk and certain vegetables , like spinach , on march 20 -- more than two weeks before @entity87 announced tuesday that radiation levels would similarly be regulated in seafood			0
one scientist , whose institute will start conducting research next month tracking radiation off @entity2 , said it 's likely that such levels in fish will increase for six months -- as the contamination gets in the food supply -- then gradually go down over two or more years			2
still , given the standards now being set , he thinks people should feel comfortable eating seafood from @entity2			0
" the current regulations are quite reasonable , " said @entity185 , a research fellow for the @entity187 - based @entity186			0
" so , of course , please eat fish			0
it is good to revive the fishing industry			0
" @entity0 's @entity193 and journalists @entity194 and gen @entity196 contributed to this report .			0

members of @entity2 's fishery association met wednesday with @entity16 officials
they say the utility ignored their pleas not to dump tons of radioactive water at sea
the group cites " rage " among fishermen for what it called " irresponsible behavior "
a @entity2 official says fishermen will get money for suffering *due* to to nuclear crisis
