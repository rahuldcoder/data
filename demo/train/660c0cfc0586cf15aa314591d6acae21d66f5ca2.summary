-- a new poll this week claims the thing people most want to see in an airport is a cinema			1
not automated , super-fast security checks , not complimentary @entity8 - star dining options , not even @entity10 - style transporters to your destination ( presumably those questioned could have chosen anything ? )			0
no , it seems people are resigned to the fact that airports must be endured rather than enjoyed , and a good movie is the most we can even wish for , let alone expect			1
kudos to @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , which all have cinemas in their international airports already			2
flight comparison site @entity27 asked 10,000 people what they would most like to see in an airport			2
responses ranged " from a gym to a beach , " the site said			0
nearly half chose cinemas as their top airport wish , followed by " sleep pods " ( 36 % ) and a library ( 32 % )			1
other items included a park , a pool and a " vanity area			0
" but who has time for all these activities ? can you have fun in an airport ? are n't airports most often sites of flustered , sweaty travelers rushing between gates , or tense mothers squawking at their children to " sit still ! " or irate latecomers having melt downs ? perhaps these enjoyable amenities would make us all arrive earlier and feel happier			2
no doubt frequent flyers spending several hours each month wondering what to do between @entity64 / @entity63 and @entity65 would appreciate the distraction			0
@entity67 was the first airport to have an @entity69 cinema within			1
it 's a behemoth 358 - seater with a 22 - meter - high screen			0
but despite being open to the general public , not just fliers , up to 40 % of the audience are airport and airline staff , says @entity78 , deputy marketing manager at @entity79 , which operates the @entity69 in @entity22			1
and anecdotal evidence from travelers suggests the place is rarely full , or even close to it			0
@entity24 's changi airport has two cinemas , only accessible to passengers , but they are relatively modest at 13 seats and 55 seats			1
@entity90 's @entity89 was built with a specific audience in mind : " we opened a theater at the airport to target the massive number of @entity97 ( @entity97 ) fans who come to the airport , " says a @entity101 representative			2
these include local residents as well as international travelers who flock to see their favorite k - pop artists and @entity107 movie stars as they travel through the airport			0
@entity101 is catering to an eager crowd , but the spokesperson admits days are usually pretty quiet			0
do we want what we say we want ? the evidence seems to suggest that despite the professed wishes of cinema - deprived travelers , where airport cinemas exist already , people are n't really that bothered			1
figure in the amount of space a cinema takes up , the logistics , the cost , the maintenance and other bits and pieces that go into managing the space , and it 's probably just as well most airports concentrate on other things			1
what do you think ? would you use an airport cinema if you had the time ? tell us below			0

nearly half of those surveyed say they would like a cinema in airports
but where airport cinemas already exist , few people *reportedly* use them
@entity67 's @entity69 cinema is the *biggest* in the city
