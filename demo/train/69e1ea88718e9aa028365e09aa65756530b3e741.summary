-- on @entity3 's " @entity2 " this past sunday , i was asked how we can make our schools safer and prevent another massacre like @entity7 from happening again			1
i suggested that if one person in the school had been armed and trained to handle a firearm , it might have prevented or minimized the massacre			1
" and i 'm not so sure -- and i 'm sure i 'll get mail for this -- i 'm not so sure i would n't want one person in a school armed , ready for this kind of thing , " i said			1
" the principal lunged at this guy			0
the school psychologist lunged at the guy			1
has to be someone who 's trained			0
has to be someone who 's responsible			0
" well , i sure did get mail			0
many people agreed with me and sent me examples of their son or daughter 's school that had armed security guards , police officers or school employees on the premises			1
many others vehemently disagreed with me , and one dissenter even wrote that the blood of the @entity39 victims was ultimately on the hands of pro-gun rights advocates			0
to that person i would ask : suppose the principal at @entity44 who was killed lunging at the gunman was instead holding a firearm and was well trained to use it			1
would the result have been different ? or suppose you had been in that school when the killer entered , would you have preferred to be armed ? evidence and common sense suggest yes			1
in 2007 , a gunman entered @entity57 in @entity58 and shot and killed two girls			2
@entity60 , a former police officer stationed as a volunteer security guard at the church , drew her firearm , shot and wounded the gunman before he could kill anyone else			2
the gunman then killed himself			0
in 1997 , high school student @entity68 stabbed his mother to death and then drove to @entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74 , and shot and killed two people			1
he then got back in his car to drive to @entity77 to continue his killings , but @entity79 , the assistant principal , ran to his truck and grabbed his pistol , aimed it at @entity83 and made him surrender			0
these are but a few of many examples that the best deterrent of crime when it is occurring is effective self - defense			2
and the best self - defense against a gunman has proved to be a firearm			0
@entity93 : teachers with guns is a crazy idea and yet , there is a near impenetrable belief among anti-gun activists that guns are the cause of violence and crime			1
like @entity106 's ring in " @entity107 , " they believe that guns are agencies of corruption and corrupt the souls of whoever touches them			2
therefore , more guns must lead to more crime			1
but the evidence simply does n't support that			2
take the controversial concealed - carry permit issue , for example			0
in a recent article for the @entity122 magazine , @entity123 , by no means an avowed gun - rights advocate , declared , " there is no proof to support the idea that concealed - carry permit holders create more violence in society than would otherwise occur ; they may , in fact , reduce it			0
" @entity123 cites evidence from @entity135 , a law professor at @entity136 , that concealed - carry permit holders actually commit crimes at a lower rate than the general population			0
the @entity141 recently found that the number of concealed weapon permits in @entity144 has surged to approximately 8 million			0
according to anti-gun advocates , such an increase in guns would cause a cause a corresponding increase in gun - related violence or crime			1
in fact , the opposite is true			0
the @entity154 reported this year that violent crime rates in the @entity144 are reaching historic lows			2
this comes in spite of the fact that the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004			0
supporters of the ban ( not including anti-gun groups who thought it did n't go far enough in the first place ) claimed that gun crime would skyrocket when the ban was lifted			1
that was n't true at all			2
in fact , after the expiration of the ban , the @entity169 , whose editorial pages are now awash with calls for more gun restrictions , wrote in early 2005 , " despite dire predictions that @entity144 's streets would be awash in military - style guns , the expiration of the decade - long assault weapons ban in september has not set off a sustained surge in the weapons ' sales , gun makers and sellers say			2
it also has not caused any noticeable increase in gun crime in the past seven months , according to several city police departments			2
" but let 's take the issue one step further and examine places where all guns , regardless of make or type , are outlawed : gun - free zones			1
are gun - free zones truly safe from guns ? @entity200 , economist and gun - rights advocate , has extensively studied mass shootings and reports that , with just one exception , the attack on @entity144 rep. @entity207 in @entity208 , @entity209 , in 2011 , every public shooting since 1950 in the @entity144 in which more than three people have been killed has taken place where citizens are not allowed to carry guns			1
the massacres at @entity44 , @entity216 , @entity217 and the @entity219 movie theater in @entity220 , @entity221 , all took place in gun - free zones			0
do you own a gun that fell under the now - expired federal weapons ban ? these murderers , while deranged and deeply disturbed , are not dumb			0
they shoot up schools , universities , malls and public places where their victims can not shoot back			1
perhaps " gun - free zones " would be better named " defenseless victim zones			0
" to illustrate the absurdity of gun - free zones , @entity123 dug up the advice that gun - free universities offer to its students should a gunman open fire on campus			0
@entity241 tells students to " act with physical aggression and throw items at the active shooter			0
" these items could include " student desks , keys , shoes , belts , books , cell phones , ipods , book bags , laptops , pens , pencils , etc. " such " higher education " would be laughable if it were n't true and funded by taxpayer dollars			2
eliminating or restricting firearms for public self - defense does n't make our citizens safer ; it makes them targets			1
if we 're going to have a national debate about guns , it should be acknowledged that guns , in the hands of qualified and trained individuals subject to background checks , prevent crime and improve public safety			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity278 .			1

@entity278 : arming , training one person in a school could help prevent shootings
he says armed people have stopped instances of mass killing
killers may target places where they know they ca n't be shot down , @entity278 says
@entity278 : guns help prevent crime and improve public safety
