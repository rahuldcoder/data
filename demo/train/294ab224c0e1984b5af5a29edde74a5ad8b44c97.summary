-- with the search for the wreckage of @entity4 now concentrated in the southern @entity5 , any debris found could give investigators some clues as to what happened to the jetliner			1
scorch marks or soot would indicate there was a fire on board			0
how pieces of metal were bent or torn could tell investigators how the plane hit the water or whether it broke up in mid-air , several experts told @entity0			1
but the real prize is the doomed jet 's flight data recorder , which may be far more difficult to recover			1
" the debris that 's floating is valuable			1
it can give us some information for the investigation , " retired @entity27 capt. @entity26 told @entity0			0
" but we really still want to get the priority , which are the ' black boxes ' of course , which will be on the bottom			1
" @entity36 prime minister @entity35 announced monday that a new analysis of satellite data puts @entity4 's last position " far from any possible landing sites			1
" the airline notified the families of the 239 passengers and crew that " all lives are lost , " as one of those relatives told @entity0			2
aircraft and ships have been watching the seas far off @entity51 in search of possible wreckage from the @entity54 for days now after satellite photos turned up what could be debris from the doomed plane			2
how ' groundbreaking ' number crunching found path of @entity4 that the search is concentrated so far off its planned @entity64 - to - @entity65 course strongly suggests the crew was incapacitated , former pilot @entity61 told @entity0 's " @entity67			1
" " let 's be very clear about this : the aircraft would not have been in that location had the pilots had control of the aircraft , had they been conscious and had they had the desire to save their lives and land somewhere , " @entity61 said as the search commenced last week			1
" so i would go on the premise that if the aircraft went down there , it was uncontrolled and ran out of fuel , " he said			0
" and in fact , that location is consistent with the full length of time the aircraft could fly with the fuel load it had			0
" former @entity89 accident investigator @entity88 said the wreckage may show signs of a fire or explosion			0
the cockpit itself , if recovered , might reveal signs of fire or whether the jet 's emergency oxygen system had been activated			1
" impact damage , certainly at the visible and especially at the microscopic level , looks a lot different than an explosion , " he said			0
and former commercial pilot @entity104 said pieces should reveal whether the plane plunged nose - first into the ocean , whether it gradually descended or whether it disintegrated overhead			2
" we 're going to be able to tell that by looking at the wreckage and looking at the deformity , now not only ( how ) it 's compressed but how it 's torn , " said @entity104 , who teaches aviation safety at @entity109			2
' they have told us all lives are lost ' another marker of the tragedy -- bodies -- may yield more clues if found , @entity117 said			2
autopsies would reveal signs of smoke inhalation , while the extent of trauma might indicate how hard the aircraft hit the water , he said			2
but why the aircraft ended up in the middle of nowhere is something the wreckage is unlikely to answer			0
that 's what makes finding the flight recorders , especially the flight data recorder , so important , said @entity137 , a former @entity139 inspector - general and @entity0 aviation analyst			1
" if the pilots were not speaking and there is no clicks or sounds of equipment , the cockpit voice recorder is not going to be a lot of help , " @entity137 said			0
" but the data recorder will be a gold mine of information and it will literally tell everything that the plane did			1
" another problem is the battery life on the locator beacons attached to the flight recorders			0
they are designed to transmit for at least 30 days , but could last up to five days longer , the manufacturer 's president told @entity0			0
finding those recorders will get more difficult with time , as debris starts to sink or get spread around by wind and ocean currents , former @entity27 captain @entity26 said			0
the flight recorders are likely on the bottom already , she said : searchers need to get ships into the suspected crash area " and try to get those eyes on any debris that we can find before that debris sinks and we lose that part of this search forever			1
" " some of this debris may go on forever and end up washing ashore eventually , but by that time it is just too late for the investigation , " she said .			0

@entity179 , deformed or scorched metal could reveal clues to investigators
the search area suggests @entity4 's crew was *n't* in control of the jet , analyst says
the flight data recorder is likely on the bottom , but would be a " gold mine "
