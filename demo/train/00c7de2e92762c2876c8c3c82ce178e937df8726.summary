raising a young family while juggling a career is a tough act to master at the best of times			1
doing so aboard a 15 - meter yacht , hemmed in by the thick ocean ice of one of the harshest environments on earth must surely complicate matters a whole lot more			1
but @entity11 would n't have it any other way			1
the @entity15 oceanographer and his wife , @entity15 , have spent the past eight winters happily recording scientific data across the northern polar - regions while living aboard a specially equipped yacht fittingly called @entity21			1
since 2007 , the couple have been accompanied by their eldest daughter , @entity23 ( now six ) and , since 2009 , her younger sister @entity26 ( now three )			0
" it 's not an ordinary life , " he explained from the lower deck of the vessel - come - family home			0
" outside is minus 27 degrees and we wo n't see the sun for at least a few more weeks			0
" [ but we ] love the wildlife , the mountains , sailing in between the ice , the mix of pack ice drifting with icebergs next to glaciers , " he added			0

polar bears , walruses and an array of spectacular arctic creatures have proved more regular company than people during these trips , which can last between six months and a year at a time			2
this year , however , the family headed further west and dropped anchor outside the remote @entity65 town of @entity66 in the @entity67			1
the trip marks the first time they have set up camp close to a human settlement			1
" the main reasons we decided to come here this winter was so that our eldest daughter could go to school and our youngest daughter could socialize with other kids her own age , " @entity11 said			1
" without kids we 'd probably live a couple of kilometers further out just to feel nature a little bit more			0
" still , the town only has a population of around 120 people and we can head out if we wish on snow mobile or with dogs , " he added			0

homes have central heating , running water and access to the internet , with @entity104 being one of the most popular modes of communication -- a far cry from the spartan existence of @entity65 communities in @entity52 and northern @entity111			1
yet these modern trappings provide the @entity113 with a happy medium between the @entity67 wilderness the family so adores , suitable schooling facilities and viable long - term research work			1
@entity11 says his current assignment is based around the earth 's changing climate			2
he is paid to measure the thickness of the winter ice , ocean currents and weather patterns in and around @entity66 for research institutions in @entity127 and @entity128			0
in previous years however , he has acted as a guide for television and documentary crews			0
" we decide where to go according to the job offered to us or the measurements we have to take , " he said			0
" if we can find such projects in the future that meet our work needs and the needs of our children then we may be able to carry on for five or ten years , " he added			0
but while enthusiastic about adventures the future may hold , @entity11 is aware that others -- especially those with young children -- may find his nomadic lifestyle in the @entity67 chill less than appealing			1
he admits there are things he misses from time to time but would advise any avid scientist , sailor or adventurer keen to experience the far north to set sail and experience it for themselves			2

" @entity162 is sitting in the sun and eating some @entity15 cheese and fresh fruit			2
" but we do n't miss it all that much			0
if we really missed something too much we would n't have been able to carry this life for such a long time			0
