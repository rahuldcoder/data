-- federal investigators ruled out foul play in a commuter train derailment in @entity5 , @entity6 , that left more than 70 people injured and shut down service along the busy @entity11 - to - @entity12 corridor , officials said saturday			1
@entity14 investigators are now focusing on a broken rail as a possible cause behind friday 's rush - hour collision of two trains			1
" it is of substantial interest to us , and we will be sending a portion of that track back to the laboratory in @entity27 , for analysis , " @entity19 of the @entity14 told reporters saturday			1
@entity19 said the fracture could have been caused by the accident itself , or it could have been broken before the trains collided			0
investigators will also look at the trains ' braking performance , wheel and track conditions , and speed and other information from data recorders , he said			1
in addition to the trains , investigators also are examining the behavior and actions of the crew			1
the wreckage wo n't be removed until investigators finish examining it on site -- possibly sunday , @entity19 said -- and then two tracks will have to be repaired before they can be reopened			1
while that happens , a long stretch of rail that tens of thousands of passengers take daily will be shut down			1
that includes @entity57 service for a 30 - mile stretch between @entity12 and @entity59 , @entity6 , and @entity61 service between @entity11 and @entity12 -- both closed indefinitely			0
" i think this is going to be with us for a number of days , " @entity6 gov. @entity63 told reporters saturday morning			0
' absolutely staggering damage ' the damage to the tracks and several train cars is " absolutely staggering , " said @entity73 sen. @entity72 , @entity6 , who visited the site with other officials saturday			1
wreckage littered an area of about 200 yards , officials said			1
" ribbons of the sides of cars are torn away like ribbons of cloth , " @entity79 said			0
" tons of metal tossed around like toy things			0
the insides of cars are shattered			0
" the two @entity57 passenger trains , heading in opposite directions , collided friday evening in southwestern @entity6 , damaging both trains and leaving some people critically injured			2
the accident occurred when a train heading from @entity11 to @entity12 derailed around 6:10 p.m. that train struck the other train in @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity19 said saturday			1
three people still were in critical condition saturday morning , according to @entity100 , spokesman for @entity101			2
the governor had said friday night that five people were seriously injured			2
of the 70 people taken to hospitals friday , nine remained in the facilities saturday morning , hospital representatives told @entity0			1
' doctors up front ' a passenger in a middle car of the @entity11 - bound train , @entity112 , said his car went dark after the crash			2
he then heard someone yell over the intercom for " all the doctors up front			0
" @entity112 said his crowded train was evacuated			2
everybody on his train was physically fine , he said , but many were shaken emotionally			2

" i saw this one car and it was completely destroyed , and they were pulling people out of the car , " @entity125 said			0
" ... they were all bloody			0
" @entity5 mayor @entity132 said friday that travel headaches could persist for weeks because the two tracks affected by the derailment -- which are both " shot right now " -- may take weeks to repair			0
cranes will have to remove the wreckage from the tracks once the @entity14 has finished its on - site probe			1
because of a bridge replacement project , those two tracks are the only way in and out of @entity11 by train from that part of @entity6			0
@entity101 said the state would set up a system taking rail @entity57 patrons from @entity5 to the closest operable station , in @entity59 , during the shutdown			0
