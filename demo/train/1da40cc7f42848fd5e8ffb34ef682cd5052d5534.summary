@entity0 -- after the @entity4 's came , my mother could not know how shadows fell across our once ebullient family : our solidarity fractured , our tempers flaring in furious incomprehension , hearts breaking in mute despair			1
none of us knew how to watch this woman disappear , her features slowly masked with blankness , her supple body rigid and wooden , her absolute vividness obliterated by the heavy fog of her disease			0
as those of us touched in some way by @entity4 's know too well , the emotional , social and economic burden of this disease is nearly unbearable -- for individuals , for families and for our country : 5.3 million @entity30 are living with alzheimer 's disease ; a new case develops every 70 seconds			1
one in eight people aged 65 and older has the disease , and the risk is even higher for those over 85			0
today , 9.9 million people are caring for a family member with @entity4 's			2
@entity4 's and other dementias cost @entity39 , @entity40 and businesses $ 148 billion annually , a number that will grow quickly and substantially as baby boomers reach age 65			2
these are words seldom associated with @entity4 's disease			1
but groundbreaking scientific research and an opportunity for powerful collaborations could lead to discovery of the ultimate cure for @entity4 's disease : its prevention			1
i know this is so because my friend dr. @entity56 , an internationally renowned @entity4 researcher at the @entity57 , has developed a research road map that calls for bringing together a group of the world 's foremost laboratory and clinical investigators in the field to make prevention a reality by 2020			2
this achievable goal adds " hope " to the vocabulary of alzheimer 's disease and holds the promise that my children and yours will never suffer its hardship			2
my son , @entity74 , is an artist like his late grandmother			0
his paintings are large and uncompromising , stunning in texture , original in design			0
he 's got the real thing			0
he 's got " it , " just as she had			0
but what if he also has something else , like the @entity85 - e4 gene , known to increase the risk of @entity4 's ? what if he is in line to inherit this devastating disease ? what i could barely endure happening to my mother , i know i could not possibly endure happening to my son			1
so , like my friend @entity94 , i embrace prevention as the ultimate cure for @entity4 's disease			1
anything short of that is too risky			0
@entity94 is identifying the biological processes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease -- long before symptoms appear -- to develop cost - effective , widely available interventions			0
she compares @entity4 's disease prevention to the polio vaccine : " had a vaccine not been developed for polio , hospital wards today would be filled with people needing artificial ventilators to breathe			1
similarly , not only is treatment of @entity4 's likely to be less effective than prevention , it 's also likely to be 10 to 10,000 times more expensive , " she recently told @entity113 magazine			1
@entity94 and her colleagues are homing in on a promising possibility : a pill containing the molecular compound that could block the chemical chain reaction in the brain that leads to @entity4 's			1
so what 's the holdup ? well , money , of course , and attitude , perhaps			2
finding a treatment within the next 10 years that will prevent alzheimer 's disease will require a major national investment to bring together the scientists to develop an effective , safe and affordable way to block the disease			1
according to @entity139 , president and ceo of the @entity141 , " no other disease causes so much suffering , is so certainly fatal , affects so many and drives so much cost with so little spent to overcome it			0
" why is that ? @entity143 , age discrimination , stigma and denial as likely explanations			0
my plea is deeply personal , but by 2050 , @entity4 's will affect as many as 16 million @entity30 , and none of us will be able to deny the reality			1
we must fight mightily now to prevent the shadow of this disease from darkening the lives of our children and grandchildren			2
we must invest today in research that will most swiftly lead to the ultimate cure : prevention			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			0

@entity163 says millions of @entity30 are affected by @entity4 's disease
new research aims to prevent the brain process that leads to the disease , she says
@entity172 : nation must commit money , attention to developing a promising treatment
