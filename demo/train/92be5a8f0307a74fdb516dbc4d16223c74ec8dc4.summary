@entity0 , @entity1 -- investigators from @entity4 and the @entity5 on wednesday inspected a wrecked @entity6 and extracted data from the car 's event data recorder they hope will help determine what caused the car to speed out of control			1
the driver of the car told police the 2005 @entity6 accelerated on its own as she was driving down her employer 's driveway on march 9			1
she lost control of the car , crossed the road and crashed into a stone wall , police say			1
she was treated for minor injuries			1
no other cars were involved in the accident			2
a team of six inspectors from @entity4 and two from @entity5 spent several hours taking photos and measurements of the damaged vehicle and downloading the black box data from the car , which has been at the @entity34 since the accident			1
two independent inspectors from a forensic technology company , hired by the @entity37 , also were aiding the investigation			0
a @entity4 spokesman , @entity39 , said that in this model year @entity6 , the black box contains data only from the moment the airbags deploy , but not the three seconds before impact that newer models are programmed to record			1
@entity39 said investigators were pleased they were able to extract any data from the vehicle			2
" we are getting information on engine speed , pedal position , that sort of thing , " @entity39 said			0
" i 'm happy we have it			0
it 's possible it might not have been in there			0
" police say the car 's driver , whose name has not been released pending the investigation , has a clean driving record and there is no reason to believe she is to blame for the accident			2
but acting police chief @entity67 said driver error is not being ruled out			0
" i 'm not sure we 're going to have conclusive information as to what caused this accident			0
but we 're not ruling out any possible causes			0
the 2005 @entity6 was part of @entity4 's november recall to address the risk of accelerator pedal entrapment in the floor mat. police say floor mats were not a factor in this particular accident , because they were secured to the seat with nylon ties			1
a recall to address a sticky accelerator problem did not include the @entity6			1
@entity39 said he would not speculate about the accident 's cause			0
the @entity6 is equipped with a brake override feature			1
" when everything in the car is working correctly , the brakes will override the engine , " @entity39 said			2
" you have to draw your own conclusions			0
" @entity39 said @entity4 will release the data from the black box recorder to the @entity34 , but will not make it public because of privacy and legal concerns			1
@entity67 said police will make a determination after their investigation how much of the data to make public			2
" if there 's definitive information that shows the cause of this accident , absolutely we 'll have to release it , " @entity67 said .			0
