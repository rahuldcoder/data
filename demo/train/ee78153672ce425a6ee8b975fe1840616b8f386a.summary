@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 football officials have lodged an official complaint with world ruling body @entity6 after @entity8 confessed that he handled the ball in the build - up to the goal which sent @entity12 to next summer 's @entity13			1
television cameras showed @entity8 guiding the ball with his hand twice , before @entity17 scored from his resulting cross to give " @entity22 " a narrow win in the two - legged @entity13 play - off against the @entity21			1
" i will be honest			0
it was a handball but i am not the referee , " the @entity24 striker told reporters after the match in @entity27			0
the @entity30 confirmed to @entity2 that @entity31 had asked the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) to demand a replay in the interests of fair play			1
" @entity8 has admitted handling the ball , claims he told the ref he handled it			1
millions of people worldwide saw it was a blatant double handball -- not to mention a double offside -- and we should put the powers that be in the cozy world of @entity6 on the spot and demand a replay , " @entity31 said in a statement sent to @entity2			1
" they probably wo n't grant it as we are minnows in world football but let 's put them on the spot			1
it 's the least we owe the thousands of devastated young fans around the country			1
otherwise if that result remains it reinforces the view that if you cheat you will win			0
" the @entity32 later confirmed that it had taken the matter to @entity6			1
" i really believe the integrity of the game has been questioned last night , " chief executive @entity60 told reporters			0
" the governing body of world football have to step up to the plate and accede to our call for a replay			1
" @entity70 said the @entity32 had also written to the @entity71			1
" they need to look at themselves in this situation			0
@entity8 is their captain and a wonderful footballer , but does he want to be like @entity77 and his legacy to be this handball , this goal that got them to the @entity13 in an unjust manner ? if we had qualified in this manner , i would n't be happy , " he said			1
" it is up to the people who govern the game now			0
every time i go to a @entity6 congress i hear about fair play and integrity			1
this was a defining game with the whole world watching , and if @entity6 believe in fair play and integrity , this is their opportunity to step forward			1
" the @entity32 has argued that there is a precedent for the result to be struck out , following @entity6 's ruling that @entity99 had to replay a play - off against @entity101 for the 2006 @entity13 in @entity102 after the referee made a mistake in awarding a penalty			1
" the @entity32 is hoping that @entity6 and its disciplinary committee will , on behalf of football fans worldwide , act in a similar fashion so that the standards of fair play and integrity can be protected , " the @entity32 said			1
@entity6 confirmed it had received the @entity4 request for a replay , but gave no timescale on a decision			2
however , it said that under its regulations the referee 's decision can not be changed			2
" law 5 states that the decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play , including whether or not a goal is scored and the result of the match , are final , " it said			2
" the referee may only change a decision on realising that it is incorrect or , at his discretion , on the advice of an assistant referee or the fourth official , provided that he has not restarted play or terminated the match			2
" @entity4 captain @entity132 , who spoke to @entity8 on the final whistle , said he felt cheated by the goal			2
" he admitted he handled it , but it does n't make me feel any better because we are not going to the @entity13 finals , " the defender said			2
" @entity6 will probably be happy			2
yet again the big decisions have gone for the bigger team			0
" football 's international governing body had faced criticism from several @entity4 players that the seeding system for the play - off draw favored more powerful nations such as @entity12			1
blog : when will @entity6 see what 's staring them in the face ? @entity153 's teammate @entity152 admitted it was " hard to speak , " as he struggled to come to terms with the result			1
" with the way we played , we certainly deserved to win the game and it killed us near the end with that handball , " he was quoted by the @entity32 web site as saying			2
" i 've seen the replay but we knew anyway ( it was handball )			0
you could see by the reaction of the players , especially @entity168 ( given ) who was two yards away from it			0
you do n't get a reaction like that			0
it was a clear handball			0
" he ( @entity8 ) almost caught the ball and actually ran into the net with it			1
" @entity21 team manager @entity179 told reporters that the referee had time to ask the linesman and then @entity8			1
" it would not have been the first time a player would have asked and it would not have been out of turn			0
" we are angry , " the @entity188 continued			0
" it is a bitter evening for me			0
i would prefer to have gone out on penalties			0
" fanzone : five of football 's most famous injustices but former @entity12 international @entity195 was emphatic that @entity8 should not have " owned up			1
" " you do n't do that , " he told @entity2			0
" @entity8 was doing his job			1
you ca n't blame him for doing everything he could for his team and country to get them to @entity204			0
" but it was a shame to finish the game like that as @entity21 had played very well			2
" referees need more help on the pitch , so as not to allow things like that			0
obviously the referee was not well - positioned and could n't see			0
" @entity215 chief @entity214 told @entity2 that @entity217 official @entity216 had clearly missed a huge decision			0
" i think the incident was more of instinct than deliberately attempting to cheat but it does seem that the ball hit his hand twice and therefore there is an issue			2
" but on the wider issue of cheating , @entity214 said : " it is all very well to blame the referees for not spotting it but fundamentally it starts with the players			0
" i think the players have to think about the game , think about the reputation of the game and their own reputations and say look actually there is a line that we will not cross			0
