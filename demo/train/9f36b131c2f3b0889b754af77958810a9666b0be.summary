for months now , his name has gone hand - in - hand with that of @entity4			2
but as the former @entity7 speaker prepares to leave the @entity9 nomination race next week , @entity5 has to decide what political causes -- and which candidates -- to support			1
@entity5 's not wasting time			1
the @entity15 billionaire and mogul and his wife , @entity17 , are two of the hosts for a fundraiser on friday for @entity7 speaker @entity21 's re-election campaign at @entity5 's casino , @entity23 , along with fellow magnate @entity24 and the @entity25			1
the @entity26 have made a big political splash , giving $ 20 million to the super pac winning our future that was largely responsible for keeping @entity32 's candidacy alive in the past few months			1
that includes a $ 5 million contribution late last month			2
@entity5 dropped some hints thursday evening telling @entity36 of the @entity37 he wanted to become less visible in the political world and that references to him being a mogul when his donations were reported were " not helpful to that person			1
" when asked if he was going to give to the @entity42 or its nonprofit affiliate @entity43 , he initially would not answer			2
later , he said to @entity36 " i 'm going to give one more small donation -- you might not think it 's that small -- to a super pac and then if i give it will be to a @entity47 , " referring to 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) non-profit groups , such as @entity43 , which are not required to disclose their donors			1
@entity5 refused to say if his reference to one " small " donation to a super pac was referring to the @entity52			1
" i 'm not going to tell you ... you 'll find out when it 's reported			2
" @entity5 previously told some supporters of @entity55 he would back his candidacy if he became the @entity9 nominee , according to sources familiar with the matter			1
what is not clear is how much he and his wife will end up donating or when			2
associates have said a major motivation for him is preventing the re-election of president @entity65			2
he thinks @entity9 would be stronger proponents for @entity67 's safety , which friends have said trumps all other concerns for him			0
" when the presidential campaign started he said his goal was to defeat @entity65 , and he was going to do whatever he could to do that , " one friend told @entity72			0
the future financial support from @entity5 is something @entity55 and his allies would like to see and have sought			1
the two men met right before the february 4 @entity15 caucuses and have spoken on the phone many times			0
about a dozen donors to the super @entity84 met with @entity5 in @entity37 in late march while they were in town for the @entity86 to convince him to " come on board			1
" he indicated to them , according to one of the participants , " it is just a matter of time			0
" while he was complimentary of @entity55 in that session , according to one source familiar with the matter , he also has publicly criticized him as not being a bold decision - maker			1
" he 's not the bold decision - maker like @entity4 is			1
he does n't want to -- every time i talk to him , he says , ' well , let me think about it , ' " he told @entity98 at the end of march			0
@entity5 has been a prolific donor to @entity9 causes in past years			1
earlier this year , he and his wife each donated $ 2.5 million to the @entity108 , a group dedicated to keeping the @entity9 majority in the @entity7			2
@entity5 was a bundler for @entity112 's 2008 presidential candidacy , helping to bring in $ 219,000 for that campaign			1
he and his wife contributed almost $ 215,000 to the @entity114 and the @entity115 , aimed at electing @entity9 candidates			2
@entity15 @entity9 also expect @entity5 to be involved in some fashion to support @entity119 sen. @entity119 's re-election effort against @entity121 rep. @entity120 , according to one @entity15 @entity9 source , and he and his wife last year maxed out their allowed donations to @entity119 and @entity126 rep. @entity125 , @entity127			1
according to the @entity128 , a nonpartisan group that tracks the role of money in politics , @entity132 and @entity134 rank as the top individuals funding outside spending groups this election cycle			0
in february , when @entity32 looked to have a serious chance at getting the @entity9 nomination , he told @entity140 he might give as much as $ 100 million to support the former @entity7 speaker			1
what is unclear is whether he will follow through with that amount and where it may go now that @entity32 will no longer be in the race			1
in that interview , he defended his donations and said he had nothing for which to apologize			0
" i 'm against very wealthy people attempting to influence elections , " he said			0
" but as long as it 's doable , i 'm going to do it			0
because i know that guys like ( @entity155 ) @entity154 have been doing it for years , if not decades			0
and they stay below the radar by creating a network of corporations to funnel their money			0
i have my own philosophy , and i 'm not ashamed of it			0
i gave the money because there is no other legal way to do it			2
i do n't want to go through 10 different corporations to hide my name			0
i 'm proud of what i do , and i 'm not looking to escape recognition			0
" the @entity26 came under some criticism from @entity9 for their support of the super pac backing @entity32 , especially when it was airing bitter ads in january questioning @entity55 's record at @entity177 and also when it became clear that @entity32 's candidacy stalled			1
@entity5 reacted to the critics in the @entity140 interview : " those people are either jealous or professional critics			2
" he added : " they like to trash other people			0
it 's unfair that i 've been treated unfair -- but it does n't stop me			0
" @entity5 was longtime friends with @entity32 from the time he served as @entity7 speaker , and the two shared common beliefs regarding @entity67 and the need to protect it			1
" i am in favor of @entity4 because i like people who make decisions			0
he is a decision - maker , " he told the @entity194 publication			1
he also was motivated because he did not want @entity196 to become the nominee			0
" @entity196 ... is too social , " he also said			0
" this man has no history creating anything or taking risks			0
" he said he knew @entity196 and liked him , but " i do n't want him to run my country			0
" a spokesman for @entity5 did not return calls seeking comment on the plans for future donations .			2

@entity5 and his wife , @entity17 , gave big to @entity32 super pac
with @entity32 planning to bow out , which *republicans* will be aided by the billionaire ?
financial support from @entity5 is something @entity55 and his allies would like to see
in past , @entity5 has criticized @entity55 for not being a bold decision - maker
