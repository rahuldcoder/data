back when @entity8 got involved with the @entity6 hotel the 365 - room facility was an under - performing part of his family 's business portfolio , which then primarily consisted of restaurants and food stalls			1
" my father was a restaurateur and he did n't really understand the ( hotel ) side ... of the business , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity19			1
" i started focusing on what would make this hotel successful , " he added			2
" all of a sudden , i figured out we 'd make more money in the hotel business than we would ever make in the restaurant business			1
" in more than half a century in the industry , @entity8 , now 80 , has built a hotel empire of more than 3,700 properties			1
when it comes to changes in a fast - moving business , @entity8 has seen it all			1
when he started out in the 50s , @entity8 was a single brand			2
these days , the industry is characterized by segmentation , with hotel corporations producing ever - more niche brands			2
" in 1981 we had a lot of big box city hotels ... someone said we are going to run out of great locations where we can build these hotels , we 've got to do something to build the company -- let 's go and build a hotel for the business man			1
" the result ? in 1983 @entity8 introduced its courtyard brand			2
" we built a 150 - room @entity59 in the suburbs of @entity61 , " @entity57 told @entity58			0
" it was tremendously successful , so then we just started cranking out these @entity59			0
they did n't have a lot of services -- limited restaurant menu , no bellman , no room service , no parking attendants -- but it was a low price for a great room			0

and he believes there 's room for more brands			0
" we 've just added @entity87 in @entity88 and @entity89 ( a series of @entity8 - owned independent hotels ) two years ago ... so we 've got a lot of stuff going on , " he said			1
and whereas once it may have been enough to simply provide hotel guests with a clean , comfortable place to sleep for the night , today 's customers demand more individual attention			2
" if somebody asks the best place to have dinner , we know where that is , " said @entity1			2
" the best place to get an @entity105 bag ? we know where that is			0
where is the best place to go sightseeing ? we are interested in taking care of your visit			0
" @entity8 says the biggest change he has seen in the last 20 years is the focus on the international market			1
in 1969 @entity8 opened its first international hotel in @entity118 , @entity119			1
it now has facilities in 73 countries and territories around the world			0
@entity8 said he first realized the true importance of the international market when his company expanded into @entity128			2

" i went to @entity142 in 1979 -- there was nothing but @entity146 suits on bicycles , no cars , everybody wore the same clothing -- but we could start to see glimmers of interest			0

@entity8 highlighted one final change in the hotel industry over the last 20 years , one that reflects a huge change in society as a whole : the prevalence of technology			1
" we continually fight the battle ( for ) more broadband , better access , " he said			0
" technology is very , very important			0
thirty percent of our reservations come through the internet			0
we are in the top eight or nine purveyors on the internet			0
" @entity8 has recently stepped down as ceo and taken up the more hands - off position of executive chairman , passing on day - to - day control of the company to former president and coo @entity181			2
but @entity8 's not about to give up all of his influence over the company he built			1
" it 's my life , it 's my vocation , " he said of his work over the last 55 years			1
" i do n't play golf , i do n't have a yacht			0
i work and i visit hotels ... it 's in my dna , " he said .			0
