-- as what might be the final battle rages in @entity4 , another is looming : the political battle to create a functioning democracy			1
as @entity4 rebels try to consolidate their military gains in @entity9 , the @entity10 in @entity11 is trying to activate plans for a political transition			1
what role the @entity14 will play in @entity4 's future is n't yet clear , but most believe it will be a major partner in an international effort			1
getting an interim government in place in @entity4 as soon as possible is critical , the @entity20 says			1
that government would lead the process of writing a constitution and getting to elections , the building blocks of democracy			2
but international assistance will be necessary to put the other blocks in place			2
the priority is security , " because we do n't need any more civilian lives lost in @entity4 , " said @entity20 spokeswoman @entity36			1
@entity14 officials said they 're encouraged by reports the rebels have set up checkpoints around public buildings to promote public safety			0
" @entity9 does not look like @entity44 looked after the fall of @entity46 , " with widespread looting , said @entity43 , assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs			0
confusion over the reported capture of one of @entity52 's sons by the opposition raised questions about whether the @entity4 people and the international community can trust the council with @entity4 's future should @entity59 fall			1
observers say the reported arrest -- and prompt reappearance -- of @entity63 are at the least an embarrassing distraction for the rebels as they seek to take control of the @entity4 capital , @entity9			1
@entity68 , minister of information for the @entity10 , acknowledged the situation over the reported capture was confusing			1
" we admit our communication was not clear , " he said , saying it had been representatives in @entity11 who stated @entity63 was under arrest , rather than the prime minister			0
@entity76 , the @entity14 ambassador to the @entity77 , said tuesday that the rebels had the confidence of the @entity14 government despite the conflicting information over monday 's arrests			1
" we have definitely found them to be credible and reliable interlocutors , " she said			0
professor @entity84 of @entity85 has met with the @entity10 and said the opposition seems acutely aware of the need to establish the rule of law			1
" from what we know , they want a democratic @entity4 , an @entity91 state but a state that is clearly a multiparty state , that is clearly a liberal state			2
it would not be unique perhaps in the world , but it is certainly an experiment for @entity4 , which has not had a state at all			2
" the rebels who @entity102 assisted in routing @entity59 forces are not professional soldiers and would need help in securing the huge stockpiles of @entity59 's weapons and ammunition , including weapons of mass destruction like mustard gas			1
there also are reports of @entity59 loyalists shedding their uniforms and melting into the crowds to fight another day			2
they will have to be tracked down			0
" all along we 've been talking about the inevitability of some foreign boots on the ground			0
that will take place , whether the fighting assumes what we would call street - to - street , block - to - block type of engagements that are characterizations of urban warfare or , more importantly , during these periods of transition , " said retired @entity131			0
" there will be a transition and it 's coming up shortly			2
you 've got to be able to lock down @entity59 's military forces so they do n't grow legs and go elsewhere and that takes some degree of a force on the ground			1
" while the @entity14 has contributed substantial assets and intelligence to @entity102 - led efforts to oust @entity59 , president @entity143 declared that no @entity14 ground troops would be used in that effort nor in the aftermath			2
referring to the rebels , a @entity151 official said on tuesday , " they have n't asked " for @entity14 boots on the ground and " they do n't want " @entity14 boots on the ground			0
the official suggested any support of that nature would have to come from international partners			2
the @entity10 's stabilization team said it is considering asking several @entity164 states -- including @entity165 , the @entity166 and @entity167 -- for a force of several hundred troops to help protect important installations in @entity9			1
@entity59 's stockpiles of mustard gas and possibly other chemical weapons and surface to air missiles constitute a threat that would go beyond @entity4 's borders			1
" well , i 'm worried about it as are many others , " said @entity177 , a former @entity14 undersecretary of state and ambassador to @entity102 , " ... because if they were to get out and proliferate , it could do untold damage on the @entity14			0
" @entity184 , a senior fellow at the @entity185 , said while he had faith in the good intentions of the rebels , " i do n't know what their capacities are to find this stuff and to secure it			0
and we are going to start having to talk about some of the issues that are a little bit more difficult like what kind of international role is going to have to be played in @entity4 once @entity59 has fallen ... we 're going to be facing questions pretty early on about whether there has to be something more , including perhaps some international forces that can go in and secure weaponry if the rebels are unable to do so			1
" @entity204 said he still has concerns about @entity4 's one - time nuclear weapons program ; even though @entity59 gave up the program , the intelligence behind it is still dangerous			1
" the smart technical brains i would imagine are still in place , and what side are they on ? where do their loyalties lie ? " the @entity10 has already agreed to a timetable for a new government			1
the next step would be an " interim authority , " broadening the @entity220 from 33 members to 60 to include newly liberated parts of the country			2
a 15 - person panel will draft a constitution over 45 days			0
the constitution would then be voted on in a national referendum and legislative elections would be held four months later			0
a presidential election would be held two months after that			0
@entity10 officials estimate the process will take 10 to 15 months			2
" ( it would ) become an interim government that would represent a broad cross-section of @entity4 from different walks of life , different parts of the country , different political backgrounds , " @entity36 said			1
but tribal loyalties , control over oil revenues and disputes over @entity4 government assets -- including $ 30 billion frozen by the @entity14 -- could cause rifts in the opposition			1
then things could turn ugly			0
i think we 're going to have to expect to see a slow transition , perhaps a chaotic transition , perhaps , even , unfortunately a violent transition that would n't be surprising at all given the degree of disinfection and disunity that this country has suffered for so long			2
the @entity14 is working with the @entity77 to release $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion in frozen assets , @entity36 said tuesday , and give the money to the @entity10 for humanitarian purposes and to " help it establish a secure , stable government			1
" @entity177 said the same international effort that carried out the military effort should now carry out the economic one			0
" the @entity143 administration made a big point of saying the @entity265 and the @entity164 should be leading			0
and i think now that needs to extend to the aftermath of the fighting , " he said			0
" if there is going be a major international economic effort to help stabilize @entity4 , to rebuild the shattered cities , of course the @entity14 should participate , but the @entity265 should lead and do more because @entity273 and @entity274 and @entity275 have greater historical social economic interests than we do , and certainly the @entity164 countries should do more to help the @entity4			1
" president @entity143 was criticized , as you remember , by some of his critics for having been too solicitous of the allies , for not having had the @entity14 in front			0
it turns out to have been a very wise policy			0
it does spread the burden and the burden should still rest on the issue of weapons and other -- and on economic aid , i think , with the @entity265 allies and with the @entity164 neighbors			0
" @entity294 , a former secretary of defense and @entity14 senator , called the international effort against @entity4 " an important geopolitical statement			1
" " other countries have to step up and carry some of the burden			0
it ca n't be the @entity14 leading every effort and you have other countries , whether it 's the @entity304 or the @entity273 or the @entity274 or others who have strong ties , historically , to @entity4 , they have to play a bigger role , " @entity294 said			1
" the @entity14 can bring its power to bear in the form of intelligence , surveillance , direct munitions or precision guiding munitions			0
we can do all of that , but it 's time for others to step up and bear some of the load that we 've been carrying for many , many years now			0
" @entity0 's @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 and @entity326 contributed to this report .			0
