@entity0 -- people trafficking syndicates could try to exploit the unrest in @entity6 , potentially causing a surge in the number of victims arriving in @entity10 , experts fear			1
the trade in people trafficking is worth $ 3 billion a year in @entity10 alone , but organized smuggling syndicates are constantly looking to expand their operations beyond national boundaries , analysts add			1
@entity17 , the @entity19 's law enforcement agency that handles criminal intelligence , says it is now sending experts to @entity21 to see if syndicates are trying to take advantage of violent protests on the other side of the @entity26			1
@entity21 has long been at the forefront of @entity10 's battle to stem the flow of illegal immigrants , due to the close proximity of some of its islands to the @entity6 coast			1
the current influx to @entity21 -- nearly 10,000 migrants since the start of 2011 -- is much higher than in previous years			2
@entity21 : @entity38 will exploit @entity6 migrant flood " i think there 's an important dynamic around the external border of the @entity19 , @entity43 , @entity45 republics and now of course @entity6 and the @entity47 , " @entity17 's director @entity40 told @entity1 tuesday			1
" we have experts on the ground in @entity21 working with the @entity21 authorities right now to try to identify any signs that organized crime , even terrorist organizations , are trying to exploit the situation in @entity6 in particular and the upsurge in the migratory flows that we 've seen in recent weeks			1
" we have n't seen any strong indications yet but we 're working very hard to see the extent to which organized crime might be doing that			0
" @entity17 's warning follows a similar one by the @entity65 refugee agency that people trying to flee @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and other countries where protests have taken place this year , will be fair game for those trying to profit from their fear and misery			2
" obviously , smugglers ' business is seeing big opportunities to exploit the situation , " @entity79 spokeswoman @entity78 told reporters in @entity81 on february 15			0
" as said in @entity68 , we are very concerned			0
we are hearing the smugglers are not only hanging out at the ports waiting for people to come , but they are actually moving inland and seeking out people falsely advertising what they could offer , what kind of futures they could offer to young @entity68 frustrated and wishing to move on , " @entity78 added , according to reports			0
there are about 270,000 trafficking victims in @entity10 at any one time , according to @entity17			2
many of these people come to @entity10 hoping for a better future but end up becoming coerced into sexual exploitation and forced labor			2
money is the driving force , @entity17 's @entity40 said , adding that trafficking syndicates are constantly looking to diversify and improve their operations			0
despite this , @entity10 law enforcement officials have had some successes			1
last year they carried out 500 operations against crime syndicates organizing trafficking and sexual exploitation			0
one operation , against a @entity114 gang allegedly trafficking @entity116 children , culminated in the arrest of 120 suspects , @entity40 said			0
@entity1 's @entity119 contributed to this report .			0
