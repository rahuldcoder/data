editor 's note : as part of @entity2 's @entity5 project , @entity2 is conducting a cultural census			1
we 're asking people to share a self - portrait , show off their handwriting , tell us what they typically eat for dinner , and more			1
this piece is part of our series focusing on the self - portrait project			1
it was inspired by the fact that the self - portrait assignment was the most popular of the five cultural census assignments , with around 500 submissions			1
@entity2 -- after scavenging through thousands of strangers ' @entity24 photo albums , you learn a thing or two about how to represent yourself online			1
" you can tell who puts in the effort to curate their online profile and who does n't , " says @entity28 artist @entity27			1
with the help of wife @entity35 , he has painted 75 portraits based on real @entity24 pictures , and in the process gained an intimate look at some of the best and worst kinds of photos you can post			1
if you use social media , you 've no doubt seen a few people who are a little shy about the whole profile picture thing			1
maybe they leave up the pale blue default avatar or hide in a massive group of nubile co- eds. or , perhaps they have an outdated photo -- or keep changing it every day			2
before you update your profile , think about what images you use to represent yourself			1
" nobody wants to see you making out with your boyfriend , " @entity35 quipped			0
the @entity58 ' @entity57 project ran from 2008 to 2010 , and the @entity24 photos they used were selected from the 5,000 or so new " friends " they made along the way			2
many of the @entity58 ' subjects made the paintings their default photos because they were such a unique creation that told so much about them			2
no surprise , social media sites are becoming more and more important for networking and socialization			2
new friends and potential employers alike could be encountering your profile photos and information before actually meeting you in person			1
profile photos are all the more important now			1
@entity27 says he was looking for amateur - style images rather than glossy compositions from professional photographers			2
" i was looking for that sort of everyday photo , but there had to be something quirky about it whether it was a prop they used or their hair was bright blue			2
" share a photo of yourself as part of the cultural census project a profile picture conveys a sense of identity , and nowhere is this more apparent than on @entity24 , which even has the word " face " in its name			1
inspired by the tradition of scholastic facebooks designed for students to identify each other , the site began as a place where college students could put names to faces and vice versa			0
whether you 're searching for a new friend or reconnecting with an old pal , photos help bridge the gaps between individuals , says @entity112 , manager of product communications for @entity24			2
they also help distinguish one @entity115 from another			0
@entity117 recommends using a photo of yourself if possible			2
however , it 's quite common to see people post photos of an inanimate object or their dog			1
" being able to see someone 's face is really important , " says @entity117			0
" it 's also a big part of expressing who you are			1
" she notes that this self - expression extends to becoming part of a community and feeling a sense of belonging			1
the @entity24 team has noticed a few trends over the years			0
in the aftermath of the 2007 @entity140 shooting , students uploaded photos with the school colors as a show of support			0
@entity145 and @entity146 bring photos of parents to profile walls every year , and spontaneous memes and trends sometimes pop up around holidays and news			1
president @entity155 's inauguration inspired many @entity156 to post artsy photos of themselves filtered in the style of @entity155 's campaign logo			1
" when you see your friends doing something or express an opinion about something ... you 're a lot more inclined to offer your own experience or share your own opinion , " @entity117 says			0
@entity24 generally keeps tight wraps on profile photo information , but other sites have actually produced graphs and visualizations based on their data aggregations			1
the dating site @entity176 maintains a blog called @entity178 , and it 's a fun place to study profile anthropology			1
@entity180 , @entity176 editorial director , says sites like @entity182 give people 140 - character status nuggets , but potential dates have less to work with			1
" a dating site is one of the few places where a stranger is trying to make a judgment about you and a profile picture is all they have to go on , " @entity180 says			0
after hours of combing through all the photos on the site and manually tagging them according to various criteria , he 's noticed a few things that seem to help users get more messages , which was a metric for defining what constitutes a " better " profile image			1
a few basics go a long way			0
skip the flash ; use natural light instead			0
do n't get super close , and make sure you 're in an interesting or meaningful setting			0
worry less about technology and more about the composition of your shots			0
" with the advent of high - quality , not too expensive , kind of pro-am cameras , people are able to take better pictures			1
" the data also suggests you might be able to get away without showing a photo of your face , so long as your chosen image is interesting and eye - catching			1
whatever you choose , be true to yourself			0
be the way you really are			0
do n't try to be a suit if you 're really a t - shirt			0
" you 've got to ask that secondary question : what am i about and who do i want to meet ? " that means putting some thought into what you hope to say about yourself with your profile			2
if you 're a world traveler and want to interact with others like yourself , @entity180 says post a photo from one of your recent adventures			0
same goes for other hobbies and pursuits			0
or , if it so happens you 're looking for romantic exploits , the numbers say you might want to consider posting something tastefully suggestive			0
and as much as people gripe about shirtless photos , @entity180 says they seem to work in the dating arena			2
" those people do get lots of messages , that 's for sure			2
" looking back on their favorite paintings , the @entity253 say photos with an original , creative approach make the best impression			0
@entity27 suggested showing some of the environment in profile photos to add context			1
he gave an example of skaters who showed an urban and industrial environment , an " almost perfect " snapshot of their life			0
another memorable image the @entity268 recall was a man in a pink bunny suit			0
the resulting painted portrait seemed to hint at inner sadness beneath the rabbit - eared smile			2
things to avoid ? intimate moments , private parts and anything tacky			0
go easy on photos of your kids , and avoid putting up photos of yourself in your underwear			0
and if children are using @entity24 , it 's especially important to exercise caution with what they 're posting online			2
but the most important rule of all might be to remember that the @entity288 never forgets , so put some thought into what you share			0
" that stuff really does stay there forever , " @entity27 says .			0

profile pictures represent you online , and help people know they 've found you
your photo should include clues about your life , say some
facebook users on *occasion* change profile photos en masse as part of social movements
share your own self - portrait as part of @entity2 's cultural census
