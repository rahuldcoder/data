-- for downloading data , the @entity1 is slower than the @entity3 , and it 's also slower than most other @entity5 smartphones , according to a study published monday			1
@entity8 analysis firm @entity7 performed a comprehensive study on several @entity11 and @entity5 handsets , including the @entity3 on both networks			2
the data suggests the differences between @entity11 and @entity5 are greater than we initially thought			2
the debut of the @entity3 on @entity5 sheds light on more subtle differences between the @entity5 and @entity11 networks			2
now that both networks have the same data - intensive iphone capable of performing identical tests , it 's been easier for researchers to collect more comparable data			0
independent tests by multiple publications , including @entity28 , have found that @entity11 's network is faster , while @entity5 's is more reliable with phone calls			1
@entity7 's tests paint a conflicting picture			0
some of their findings : -- the @entity35 performed " below average " in data download speeds when compared to other @entity5 phones including the @entity38			1
-- for voice calls , the @entity1 was one of the highest ranked in noise - canceling performance and was an average performer in voice quality			0
-- the @entity3 was the top performer in data transfer rates , but it ranks lower in call performance and @entity48 speech quality compared to some @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 phones			0
-- the @entity53 completed 10 % more download sessions than the @entity1 when the handsets were moving in a car , for instance			1
-- but the @entity35 had a 10 % better success rate when uploading data in a stationary environment , like sitting at your desk			1
the rest of @entity7 's results tell the story we 've already heard : the @entity53 's download speeds are about double the mean download speed of @entity5 's			1
however , even though @entity11 's @entity3 downloaded files faster , when it comes to loading web pages , the average load time is about the same on both devices , @entity69 added			1
@entity69 explained that many different factors affect web performance , including network latency and the operating system 's rendering times			0
( indeed , a previous bandwidth test performed by @entity81 found that both the @entity5 and @entity82 turned in the same average latency times of about 350 milliseconds			0
) most peculiar to @entity28 is that the @entity1 is " below average " in download speeds compared to other @entity5 handsets			1
was the handset purposely slowed down to avoid overloading @entity5 's network ? is there something about @entity91 's hardware that makes it slower than other handset makers ? it 's tough to say : @entity7 does n't have theories to explain the test results			1
" i ca n't say it 's related to technology at this point , " said @entity97 , vice president of information product at @entity7			0
" we 're measuring what happened , not necessarily why			0
" to perform the study , @entity69 put each phone through live tests on the @entity11 or @entity5 networks , as well as @entity7 's own simulated network			1
on the simulated network , the phones completed tests and transferred data to @entity7 's servers for more consistent , controlled results			2
the phones were also tested in both stationary and mobile environments			0
for mobile testing , the phones were tested inside automobiles while driving			0
in all , the company performed more than 10,000 web page downloads , 2,000 data download / upload tests , and 4,000 voice calls			2
