-- @entity2 star @entity1 had a " consulting relationship " with a @entity13 anti-aging clinic accused of providing banned drugs to baseball players , but there 's no evidence he did anything to violate baseball 's @entity6 , one of his attorneys told @entity0 monday			1
@entity1 is appealing a 211 - game suspension that @entity17 levied against him this month , with the league accusing him of taking performance - enhancing drugs and having ties to the now - shuttered biogenesis clinic			1
attorney @entity23 said @entity1 was one of many athletes who consulted for @entity22			1
" clearly there was a relationship -- a consulting relationship , " @entity23 said			0
" i mean , @entity22 , that lab has consulted with many professional athletes			1
not every single one of those athletes has been accused of or found guilty of using illegal substances			2
" fast facts : performance enhancing drugs in sports @entity23 declined to give further details about the relationship , citing confidentiality concerns			1
but he said , " they have no scientific evidence to prove that @entity1 did anything to violate " baseball 's drug agreement			2
" it 's witness testimony from one witness -- a witness who 's not going to be available , in my prediction , to either testify in arbitration or at some federal proceeding , " he said			0
opinion : how @entity1 let us down when asked why he would n't say unequivocally that @entity1 did n't use performance - enhancing drugs , @entity53 again cited confidentiality considerations			1
" if i utter those words , i 've just violated the confidentiality clause of the @entity6 -- that 's the bottom line , " he said			0
" ... if you 're a supporter or a detractor , what happened to him is not fair by anyone 's standards			0
it 's clearly a vendetta , it 's clearly a witch hunt to get him 211 games -- not justifiable under anyone 's scenario that is being objective			0
" @entity1 : ' i 'm fighting for my life ' apparently in response to comments like these , @entity78 , @entity17 's executive vice president of economics and league affairs , sent @entity81 a letter on monday , offering to waive confidentiality provisions			0
" while we believe that your public comments are already in breach of the confidentiality provisions of @entity17 's @entity103 and @entity89 ( the " program " ) , we will agree to waive those provisions as they apply to both @entity1 and the office of commissioner of baseball with respect to @entity1 's entire history under the program , including , but not limited to , his testing history , test results , @entity93 , and all information and evidence relating to @entity1 's treatment by @entity22 , @entity97 and @entity98 , " he wrote			1
