-- the @entity2 scandal has all the elements of a salacious story : sex , alcohol , national security , politics , exotic tropical settings and sex -- or did i already mention sex ? but beyond the breathless coverage and oh - so - shocked commentary lie some serious repercussions			1
the scandal originated in the @entity17 city of @entity18 when an agent allegedly refused to pay a local woman the agreed fee of $ 800 for her sexual services at the historic white - arched hotel where @entity25 taxpayers paid for him to sleep while traveling on official duty			1
@entity17 has asked the @entity28 to issue an official apology for tarnishing the country 's image			1
the city of @entity18 , the country 's top tourist destination , is a @entity36 world heritage site			0
its residents are bristling under the harsh and damaging spotlight			0
but the government 's demand comes in a political year , with president @entity42 facing criticism that he 's too quick to apologize for @entity44			1
instead , he should do something much more important , much more useful for all concerned , including the @entity25 people			2
he should take this opportunity to begin taking @entity44 seriously			1
it is sadly symbolic that we now hear about @entity44 -- @entity17 , and perhaps @entity54 and @entity55 -- as places where official representatives of the @entity25 government may have crossed the line			1
the incident and the coverage are emblematic of a low regard for the region			0
@entity42 had traveled to @entity18 to attend a @entity61 , a gathering of some 30 presidents and an opportunity for the @entity25 to strengthen ties and renew a position of leadership in partnerships with its neighbors			1
the summit , as it happens , was a disaster for the @entity25 @entity74 emerged isolated and unable to produce any positive results			2
but , of course , few people in the @entity25 noticed , because the news focused on sex , prostitutes and vodka			2
the @entity25 has been ignoring @entity44 , at its own peril , while other powers are capitalizing on the region 's renaissance			1
and it 's not just the @entity42 administration			2
remember when president @entity91 declared , " the @entity25 has no more important relationship in the world " than the one with @entity90 ? he said it on september 7 , 2001			1
four days later , on 9/11 , @entity90 fell off the agenda			0
but while @entity74 has remained focused on admittedly urgent problems elsewhere , not everyone else has neglected @entity44			2
not long ago , @entity74 was the region 's undisputed top trading partner			0
since then , @entity98 has moved in			0
and @entity99 has made inroads precisely at the time when @entity44 is emerging as a key global player			2
also making inroads in @entity44 , incidentally , is @entity104			2
@entity98 's trade with most countries in @entity44 has skyrocketed			2
@entity99 has become @entity108 's top economic partner , just as @entity108 has emerged as the world 's sixth - largest economy , bigger than the @entity111 , @entity112 or @entity113			0
@entity74 , meanwhile , delayed and played politics with a free trade agreement with @entity17 it signed six years ago			2
the pact finally goes into effect on may 15			0
on may 15 , @entity42 should take action			2
that 's the day when the president should announce a new initiative to overhaul @entity44 's relations with @entity17 and the rest of @entity44			1
@entity42 should announce plans to promote trade and tourism , so that people @entity128 will learn about the other and erase dated stereotypes while spurring prosperity			0
he should convene a commission to explore innovative ways to combat drug cartels , an urgent issue for the region			0
and he should leverage @entity44 's huge @entity139 population to link the two sides and highlight a common history			0
if @entity42 fails to do this , then @entity142 , the presumptive @entity143 nominee for president , should take the lead			1
because overhauling relations with @entity44 -- improving trade ties , developing stronger person - to - person bonds , coordinating diplomatic and international policies -- will benefit both sides , and it will also earn votes to the candidate who champions the approach			1
@entity17 , as it happens , is the perfect place for @entity74 's pivot			0
@entity158 carries a cover story called " the @entity17 comeback " on the most recent international edition , featuring a full - page photograph of @entity17 president @entity163			1
that 's because @entity17 has truly performed a miracle , emerging from half a century of armed conflict and horrific violence to a position of strong economic growth			1
the @entity17 economy grew 6 % last year , and it is on track to surpass @entity55 to become the second - largest economy in @entity174			1
@entity17 has recently become a major oil producer			0
@entity177 members are trying to entice it to join the oil cartel			0
@entity17 still has many serious problems , including violence and a great deal of poverty , but it has remained committed to democracy and free markets			0
its capital city @entity187 is @entity44 's best friend in @entity174			1
but as in all neglected love affairs , the two have been growing apart			0
@entity163 has repaired damaged relations with @entity192 and others in the region			0
he said that @entity17 sees itself as " a bridge " between @entity74 and all of @entity44 , including countries with which it does not have good relations			1
as the @entity25 public continues to learn details of the @entity2 scandal -- and you can bet the coverage will not soon die down -- @entity42 has an opportunity to turn this scandal to everyone 's advantage			1
instead , make up for @entity44 's failings by changing course			0
increase a push for trade so that the @entity25 and @entity44 can benefit from stronger economic ties and building a hemispheric bloc that makes @entity128 , together , stronger on the global stage			1
it will help both sides , and it will also help on @entity213			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			0

after the @entity2 scandal , @entity17 asked president @entity42 to apologize
@entity220 : @entity42 should n't apologize , but he needs to start taking @entity44 seriously
she says the @entity25 has been ignoring , at its own peril , a region amid its renaissance
@entity227 : @entity42 should push for stronger economic ties and partnership with @entity174
