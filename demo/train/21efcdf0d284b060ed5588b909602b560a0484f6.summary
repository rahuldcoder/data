former @entity1 presidential nominee @entity0 is heading to @entity2 next week to campaign with @entity1 @entity4 nominee @entity3 , @entity5 has learned			1
this comes as @entity1 officials believe @entity3 , the @entity2 house speaker , has closed the gap in his race against endangered incumbent sen. @entity10			1
@entity0 , who won @entity2 in the 2012 general election , is scheduled to attend a rally with @entity3 in @entity14 next wednesday , which " will be a big shot of momentum " for the campaign in the closing days , campaign manager @entity11 told @entity5			1
@entity3 allies believe they have gained some support following the controversy surrounding @entity21 admitting she missed a classified briefing on @entity24 and other security threats to attend a fundraiser			2

" a lot of people in @entity67 are rooting for him to get in , " said one source			1
" he 's not one of them			0
" another source close to @entity0 put it this way : " i would n't bet on it , but i would n't bet either			0
