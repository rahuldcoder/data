-- few issues divide people more sharply than abortion			0
so it is great news when recently lawmakers across the political aisle in @entity8 voted 181 to 1 to ban sex - selective abortion			1
the overwhelming support for banning abortion of a fetus based on its gender is progressive , moral and just			0
but what about gendercide -- the practice of killing baby girls , whether aborted or neglected after birth ? surely , there is no room for disagreement on the need to end gendercide			1
for every woman who freely chooses to abort a girl , there are countless others who are being forced to do so because of strong cultural preference for son			2
the sex - selective abortion of baby girls is not a pro-choice or a pro-life issue			1
it is a human rights issue that must be approached as an area of common ground			1
it is a woman 's right to give birth to her daughter			0
for most of us , hearing " it 's a girl " during a pregnancy ultrasound is cause for celebration			0
but in many countries , this phrase can be a death sentence			0
in fact , the words , " it 's a girl " are the deadliest words on earth when heard during pregnancy			0
according to a @entity56 estimate , up to 200 million women are missing in the world today due to gendercide			2
in @entity61 , the birth ratio of girls to boys is the most skewed in the world -- approximately 100 girls born for every 118 boys			1
when couples are restricted to one child , women often become the focus of intense pressure by their husband and in - laws to give birth to a boy			2
a woman need not be dragged out of her home and strapped down to a table to be a victim of forced abortion			2
crushing social , economic , political and personal pressures in cultures with a strong son preference trample women who are pregnant with a girl			0
all too often , women in these cultures do not " choose " their daughters for abortion			2
the " @entity90 " exhibit recently on view in @entity89 gave dramatic visual form to the girls that have been lost to the world through sex - selective abortion -- the haunting stares of an army of the dead			1
because of gendercide , there are an estimated 37 million more men than women in @entity61			1
as a result , the presence of " excess males " is one of the driving forces behind human trafficking and sexual slavery , not only in @entity61 but in surrounding nations as well			1
alarmingly , @entity61 also has the highest female suicide rate of any country in the world			2
according to the @entity116 , the number of female suicides has risen sharply in recent years , from 500 women per day to a staggering 590			0
i believe that this grim statistic may be in some ways related to pressure on women to selectively abort or abandon their daughters			2
in @entity126 , the sex ratio at birth is 112 boys born for every 100 girls born			1
@entity126 girls , moreover , die of disease and neglect at a much higher rate than boys			1
impoverished women in @entity126 are often manipulated or pressured into sterilization , which is one way of population control			1
there are even mass " sterilization camps " where women sometimes die of complications			0
just this week , in @entity143 , one of @entity126 's poorest areas , 11 out of 83 women who were sterilized died			2
this is the true " war on women " on a global scale			0
that one - third of the world 's women -- those living in @entity61 and @entity126 -- are deprived of their right to bear girls is the biggest women 's rights abuse on earth			1
these women deserve a passionate response from groups that stand for women 's rights			2
yet the response of the @entity162 women 's rights community has ranged from tepid to confused			0
my organization , women 's rights without frontiers , has launched the " save a girl " campaign in rural @entity61 , and we are stopping gendercide , one baby girl at a time			1
we have fieldworkers in @entity61 who reach out to women who have learned that they are pregnant with or have just given birth to a girl , and are being pressured to abort or abandon her			1
a fieldworker will visit that woman and say , " do n't abort or abandon your baby just because she 's a girl			0
she 's a precious daughter			0
we will give you a monthly stipend for a year to help you support her			0
" the practical support we offer empowers these women to keep their daughters			0
our effort has helped more than 120 families keep their daughters			0
we plan to launch a " save a girl " campaign in @entity126 in 2015 as well			0
every struggling mother in @entity61 and @entity126 deserves help to keep her daughter			1
together , we can end gendercide one girl at a time and sweep sex - selective abortion into the dung - heap of history , where it belongs .			1

the @entity8 @entity199 recently voted 181 to 1 to ban sex - selective abortion
@entity201 : while abortion is divisive issue , we should all agree to end gendercide
she says in countries such as @entity61 and @entity126 , women are often forced to abort baby girls
@entity210 : @entity211 is human rights abuse with bad and tragic consequences
