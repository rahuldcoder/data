you just ca n't stop @entity2 at the @entity3			1
when the world @entity6 beat sixth - seed @entity8 7 - 6 ( 5 ) 6 - 7 ( 4 ) 6 - 3 6 - 0 in a contentious slugfest in @entity5 , he become only the second man to claim five @entity3 titles			1
and with @entity2 27 , odds are that he 'll match @entity14 's record haul of six			1
@entity14 was in attendance sunday along with other @entity17 tennis legends , including @entity18			0
" i love my time being here , " @entity2 told reporters			1
" being mentioned in the elite group of legends in our sport is a huge privilege and honor			0
i ca n't say how proud i am			0
" that 's going to serve definitely only as a great deal of inspiration for the rest of my career			0
" this was the third time @entity2 downed the @entity35 in a final at @entity37 and how @entity8 will be ruing blowing a lead in the third set			1
mind you , @entity2 let slip a 4 - 2 advantage in the second set and thus might have won in three if not for a lapse			1
@entity2 looked spent physically early in the second and in the opening stages of the third , by which time the two had been on court for almost three hours			1
he wobbled on his feet , struggled to get serves in play and went to ground after a rally			0
not that @entity8 wanted to buy into any of it			1
he felt the @entity53 was bluffing and could be heard uttering on court about his friend : " do n't worry about him , he does it all the time			0
" @entity8 , though , did let it get to him			1
" he obviously looked like he was in quite a bad way at the beginning of the third set and came back unbelievable at the end of that set , " @entity8 told reporters afterward			2
" then obviously the way he was hitting the ball in the fourth and moving was impressive			0
" if it was cramp , how he recovered from it , that 's a tough thing to recover from and play as well as he did at the end			0
" so , yeah , i 'm frustrated at myself for letting that bother me at the beginning of the third set , because i was playing well , i had good momentum , and then just dropped off for like 10 minutes and it got away from me			0
" @entity2 overturned a 2 - 0 hole in the third and saved a break point at 3 - 3 when he struck a drop volley that forced @entity8 into an error			1
@entity2 immediately urged the crowd to back him and they did			2
energized , he did n't lose another game to collect his eighth major overall to join among others @entity8 's former coach , @entity82			2
a cool handshake at the net after roughly four hours of play followed			0
@entity8 , too , did n't laugh during the trophy presentation when new dad @entity2 wished him and fiancee @entity88 " many kids " in the future			1
@entity2 denied he was feigning injury or trying to throw @entity8 off his game			1
" the length of the rallies and the physicality that we had in the first two sets have taken an energy from me , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's normal to expect that you ca n't always be , you know , at your 100 %			0
" so you go through some particular moments that you can call crises during matches like these			0
this is what i had in these 15 , 20 minutes			0
after that i felt better			0
" if @entity8 was n't best pleased with @entity2 's antics , he should also spare some criticism for his own second serve			1
against the elite @entity8 's second serve can be the source of trouble and on sunday @entity2 captured 66 % of those points			1
@entity2 began the final flawlessly , hitting 10 winners and one unforced error to build a commanding 4 - 1 lead			1
broken at 4 - 2 , @entity2 regained the break but injured his thumb when he slipped near the net			2
temporarily frazzled , @entity2 could n't serve out the set and called for the trainer			2
a @entity8 double fault at 4 - 2 in the tiebreak -- a double fault by @entity8 in a tiebreak in the 2013 final was costly -- and later a missed volley gifted @entity2 the first			1
@entity2 won 13 straight points at one stage in the second set to reverse a break deficit but said a brief stoppage after two protestors ran on court in the middle of the second halted his progression			2
a strong start from @entity8 in the tiebreak was enough to see him level the affair			2
by this time he was clearly in the ascendancy and needed to put @entity2 -- who had lost five of his previous seven grand slam finals -- away			2
the knockout blow never came and @entity2 ultimately improved to 8 - 1 in his last nine matches against @entity8			1
he ended the match as he began it , making a paltry three unforced errors in the fourth			0
" i started hitting the ball more , covering the court better , shortening the points , " said @entity2			2
yet @entity8 did something this fortnight he was n't able to achieve last year as he recovered from back surgery -- land in a grand slam final			1
" we put in a lot of hard work to try to get back in this position after what was a difficult year last year , " he told the crowd , referring to his entourage			0
" unfortunately i could n't do it tonight but i 'm a little bit closer than i was a few months ago and i 'll keep working hard to get there			0
" like saturday 's women 's winner , @entity167 , @entity2 has never been beaten past the quarterfinals at @entity37			2
a pair of veterans won sunday 's mixed doubles title			0
@entity172 and @entity173 , who flourished for the @entity174 in @entity175 , beat @entity176 and @entity177 6 - 4 6 - 3			0
@entity172 is 41 and @entity173 is 34 .			0

@entity2 beats @entity8 in the @entity3 final
the world *no.* 1 wins in four sets after a punishing first two sets
@entity2 becomes the second man to claim five *oz* titles
