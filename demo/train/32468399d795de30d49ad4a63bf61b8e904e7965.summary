@entity0 -- two things motivate house speaker @entity3 in his showdown with @entity5 and president @entity6 , sources close to him say -- one personal , one philosophical			1
the personal one is evident through how he deals with his caucus of 232 republicans , especially the unruly tea party group			0
@entity3 originally did not want to tie a contentious effort to defund @entity14 to spending legislation needed to avert a shutdown			1
he expressed that sentiment as far back as march			0
" our goal here is to cut spending			2
it 's not to shut down the government , " @entity3 said			1
" i believe that trying to put @entity14 on this vehicle risks shutting down the government			1
that 's not what our goal is			0
" but ultimately , there were enough @entity29 demanding the two issues be linked that @entity3 changed his mind			1
why ? " he has been seen people rise and fall , " a source close to him said			0
in fact , he was one of them			0
when @entity3 was @entity37 chairman , he was part of a small group of @entity29 @entity41 leaders who met in 1997 to discuss ousting their fellow @entity41 speaker , @entity42			1
opinion : no good options for @entity3 the coup failed and @entity3 claimed he was only gathering information , not conspiring			1
but by the next year , his fellow @entity47 had ousted him from leadership			0
upon hearing the bad news , he told an aide , " we are going to smile , we are going to work hard , and earn our way back			0
" and he did just that -- from exile through various top positions on committees to the leadership of @entity29 republicans and then his election as speaker			1
" you could never have predicted in 1998 the recovery of @entity3 , " said @entity60 , now a host of @entity1 's " @entity61			1
" " so i think first of all his discipline , his focus on getting the job done , being a very effective insider , raising resources , campaigning for members			0
" he managed to recover , which is historically not abnormal -- speaker @entity71 had the same kind of experience , so it happens occasionally			1
but it takes an unusual amount of willpower to be defeated by your colleagues , and make a comeback with the same colleagues , " @entity60 said			1
the lesson learned ? listen to party members and try to adapt to what they want -- sometimes leading them , sometimes following , sometimes protecting them from themselves , and sometimes -- as with the government shutdown -- letting them learn the lesson that if you touch a pot on a hot stove , you will get burned			2
" when he was sworn in as speaker , he had 15 rebels vote against him on the @entity29 floor			1
he has this group of 30 to 40 hardcore conservatives who are more than willing to dump @entity3 any chance they can , " said @entity94 , a consultant and former aide to @entity41 leaders			1
@entity101 still gets paid " from @entity3 's perspective , he 's learned from what happened with @entity42			1
that 's why he 's more disciplined , listening more to his caucus , less likely to freelance than @entity42 was			2
going through this process for him is more of a step - by - step process , " @entity94 said			0
not enough @entity47 yet see that this path is likely one that will hurt them politically			0
when that changes , @entity3 will pursue a path out			2
but he will not be exiled again			0
we 've got a lot of divergent opinions in the caucus and the key to any leadership job is to listen , " @entity3 said two weeks ago			1
" you know , i was here during the @entity60 era			2
he had a little plaque that was in his office			0
and it was a management model : ' listen , learn , help , and leave			0
' we listened to our colleagues over the course of the last week			0
we have a plan that they 're happy with			0
" the philosophical part of this equation is @entity3 's concern about the debt and his belief that @entity6 does n't get it			1
" the president told me in the @entity137 back in december , ' we do n't have a spending problem , we have a health care problem , ' @entity3 said in an interview in late march			1
" and as long as the president continues to cling to the fact that we do n't have a spending problem , and clings to the fact that we 're not taxing the @entity147 people enough , it 's going to make it hard to get to an agreement			2
" but it 's not like the @entity29 ' budget balances			2
" our budget is a vision of how we would go , " @entity3 said			2
" and clearly we believe that @entity14 is bad for the country , it 's going to drive up the cost of health insurance for the @entity147 people			2
it 's going to hurt employers building to hire more people			0
it 's not in the nation 's interest			0
" democrats , @entity47 and the insane leap into the abyss			0

house speaker @entity3 originally did n't want to tie spending bill to @entity14
@entity3 was involved in failed coup when @entity42 was speaker after last shutdown
in the *aftermath* of failed ouster of @entity60 , @entity3 lost his leadership post
@entity3 has learned lessons from that experience , former @entity29 leadership aide says
