-- the annals of late - night television talk shows are full of failure			1
@entity4 says he believes late - night talk is ready for more diversity			1
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 all tried to challenge the legendary @entity11 's supremacy ; all fell short			0
@entity13 lasted less than eight months as host of a @entity16 show ; @entity17 lasted less than eight weeks on his @entity16 entry			0
even in recent years , when late - night shows are all over cable , few make a dent in the ratings or in the public consciousness			1
so does comedian and former sitcom star @entity4 believe he can overcome those challenges and put on a talk show people will talk about ? to paraphrase a slogan @entity4 heard plenty last year , when he traveled the campaign trail as one of @entity33 's supporters : yes ... he ... does			1
" i believe that that audience is more diverse , less represented than it 's ever been , " he said in a phone interview , noting that -- though it 's been 20 years since the @entity39 - @entity38 performer @entity37 launched his late - night show -- late night remains the preserve of generally white male comedians			1
" it 's not even about black and white anymore , because so many people are from mixed backgrounds and mixed ethnicities , and it 's just a great time to be able to pull all that together			1
" @entity4 , whose show will air on @entity52 beginning in november , is no stranger to talk shows			1
he was on @entity11 's " tonight " show , and he admires @entity55 and @entity56 , among others			1
but he thinks a @entity4 show will bring some fresh energy to late night			1
( @entity52 , like @entity0 , is a unit of @entity62			0
) the comedian says he already has big plans to make his show distinctive , from its more open setting to @entity4 's determination to make the audience a key part of the show			1
he talked about some of his hopes with @entity0 last week			0
the following is an edited version of that interview : @entity0 : so i see you 're doing a @entity78			0
@entity4 : yes , brother			2
@entity81 has come to the @entity82 , change has come to late night ! @entity0 : how did this come about ? @entity4 : well ... when i was doing " the @entity87 " -- probably into like the 30th episode , [ and ] we ended up doing 120 shows , [ a production company executive ] said , " hey , would you consider a talk show ? " and i 'm like , " dude , i got a gig			1
" he said , " it 's not going to last forever			0
when it 's over ... [ so ] let me put this bug in your ear , five years early			0
" i kinda never considered it , although ... i 've been on every show			0
and what 's appealing to me now ... is that i believe that that audience is more diverse , less represented than it 's ever been			2
... i can take a little more liberties than if this show were on network tv , where everybody 's afraid to say something wrong because you might piss off an advertiser			2
[ and ] i believe the fact that a @entity114 - @entity38 guy hosting his own late - night talk show is appealing to advertisers			1
i look at that as a positive			0
look , @entity119 is at the @entity114 border -- i wish my show were on tonight so i could talk about it			2
@entity0 : does it intimidate you getting a @entity78 ? lord knows there have been a zillion late - night talk shows , and many of them end up in tv graveyards			1
@entity4 : i think it goes case by case , @entity132			2
i mean , @entity17 probably was n't the right person for that format ... i think the visibility of my [ sitcom ] and the success and popularity of my standup , and being a little edgier and a little different and not milquetoast by any means and not @entity143 white male , and being unafraid and seeing the change [ will help ]			0
... i think it helped me to campaign with @entity33 for a year			1
... i know what 's out there , and i know that that audience is not served , and cable tv is a great place to attract those people			2
@entity0 : the press release mentions a " street - party atmosphere			0
" have you had a chance to work through that a little bit and decide what that means ? @entity4 : absolutely			2
we shot a production pilot ... [ and ] what we did was we created an amphitheater outside at @entity165 , right where they shoot " er " where the ambulance entrance is			0
we built a set there , and i used @entity171 's band led by [ her musical director ] @entity173			0
... we did n't use seats , we used kind of an amphitheater feel , and since we shot it out on the street , it did have a different feel			0
... with a younger audience and the music , [ it ] made it more exciting and a little different with me as host than i think than what 's on late night now			1
@entity0 : you mentioned having @entity171 's band			0
is that going to be a regular feature ? is there going to be a sidekick ? @entity4 : i 'm not going to do a sidekick , but i 'll use audience members , so i 'll have potentially 360 sidekicks if i see somebody who 's really interesting			1
one of the aspects we used in the pilot was having audience members actually ask questions from their seat -- not from a preset microphone , but from their seat			0
... that 's a part of it that i think is different and fun , and i do n't want there to feel like you 're at a movie , where you 're just watching a show			2
i want you to feel like you can potentially be part of it			0
like i told somebody before , if you go to a flea market or a swap meet , you 'll find anything you want , but if you go to a store that 's a high - end department store , you 're only going to find what they have			0
so being a poor guy growing up , and getting stuff from thrift shops growing up , i 'd like to think that this will be the flea market of late - night talk shows , that you can probably find anything there .			1
