-- you 've been thinking about it for weeks			1
mounds of turkey piled high with buttery mashed potatoes , dripping with gravy			1
or sweet potato casserole and pecan pie			1
every year , we spend hours making the traditional @entity15 favorites just like our mom used to do , like her mom did before that			1
" when you do something repeatedly over the years , it builds up a kind of power , " nutritional psychologist @entity19 says			2
" it creates its own momentum			2
to make the same dish year after year , decade after decade , there 's something in that that connects us to the past			2
" nostalgia comes from the @entity34 word for homecoming ( nostos ) and pain ( algos )			1
but experts say feeling nostalgic is actually good for your mental health			1
anything can bring on that special moment -- music , smells , photos			2
we play the same songs , cook the same recipes , take the same family photo in the same spot next to the same fireplace because we 're human , @entity19 says			2
our biological functions are based on repetitive rhythms			2
our brains are hardwired to relax when surrounded by the familiar			2
" emotional eating has gotten a bad name , " @entity19 says			2
" we 're emotional people			1
we 're built for pleasure			2
" nostalgic products fill a need to belong and feel socially connected , according to an @entity63 study published in the @entity64 last year			1
that 's why this time of year , tv and radio ads are filled with smiling families sitting around a large table in holiday sweaters , passing the dinner rolls			0
even if you 're far away from home , companies want you to believe that buying those same dinner rolls will fill your heart with holiday joy			1
turns out , it works			0
dr. @entity79 works with other researchers from the @entity82 's nostalgia project			1
he recently published an article in the @entity84 titled " the past makes present meaningful			0
" nostalgia , @entity79 found , increases a person 's self - esteem			1
@entity89 activities like going to class or attending meetings are routine , even boring			0
when we engage in nostalgia , we tend to think of the things that are really important to us			1
that makes us feel like our life is meaningful			1
@entity98 's sweet potato tart recipe " what 's amazing about autobiographical memory is that bad memories fade faster than positive memories , " @entity79 says			0
" one thing that 's interesting about nostalgia is that it 's not 100 % detail accurate -- it 's more the highlights			1
" nostalgia is largely social			1
@entity79 ' s studies found that people who are alone or disconnected feel better after engaging in nostalgia			1
yet you 're probably dreaming right now about your grandfather 's deep - fried turkey , not about him , right ? " is it really about the food ? " @entity79 asks			0
" or is the food just sort of a trigger or cue for what the holidays are really all about , which is relationships			0
we do n't eat these foods other times of the year because we 've segmented them off as special			0
they go with this occasion			0
they go with the relationships			0
" for @entity98 editor @entity129 , @entity15 means cooking for the ones she loves			0
she gets satisfaction in putting good food on the table for her family			0
so many of our best moments from the past , she says , are rooted in our sense of smell			0
" we call them food memories			0
when it comes to the holidays we are always trying to recreate the magic and the specialness we experienced when we were children			0
" so indulge in a little @entity15 daydream			0
long for the oyster stuffing			0
sniff the air in anticipation of mom 's pumpkin pie			0
then on the big day , enjoy your holiday feast , and all the benefits that come from the power of nostalgia .			1
