-- i was walking down @entity2 in @entity3 last week when my @entity4 beeped to alert me that @entity6 mayor @entity5 had proposed saving obesity - prone urbanites from themselves by banning restaurant sales of large sugary sodas and teas			1
nor was he taking any chances on a thumbs - down from @entity6			1
instead of putting the measure to referendum , he is bypassing the vote to seek approval from the 11 members of the @entity19 , who are all his handpicked appointees			0
knowing what i do about @entity5 's relationship with sugary drinks , i stopped , stunned			0
is n't this the same man who made @entity27 the official drink of @entity6 , giving its sucrose - laden potions a monopoly in high school vending machines over the objections of the health - conscious ? but this whiff of hypocrisy is just one of the many problems with this proposition			1
imposed bans and " sin taxes " often have unintended consequences			2
for example , the high cigarette taxes that @entity6 has imposed to discourage smoking while filling government coffers have instead driven cigarette sales underground -- as entrepreneurs buy untaxed cartons from @entity50 shops and other outlets , then sell them cheaply on the street			1
the tax - evading tobacco addicts are still smokers , but now they are criminals , too , as the state rakes in extra revenue , but citizen smokers realize no health benefits			1
this result may have been unintended , but it could hardly have been unforeseen : when @entity61 imposed even higher taxes on cigarettes , tobacco smuggling became an industry worth $ 1.5 billion ( in @entity61 dollars ) as the enterprising stocked up in the @entity66 plying the waters of @entity69 after dark in boats laden with contraband cigarettes , freelance tobacco merchants became indistinguishable from the cocaine and marijuana smugglers with whom they shared the night			1
the moral ? autocratically imposing public health measures rather than persuading people of their worth can easily backfire			1
reducing the high intake of sugary drinks is a laudable goal , but should it be a priority , and if so , is this the best way to pursue it ? no , and no. imposing an outright ban is less ethical than public health leadership that induces behavior change			1
some public health experts have achieved such positive health behavior transformations very successfully indeed			1
as a visiting fellow at the @entity93 's @entity92 in the early 1990s , i observed its masterful spearheading of the @entity66 " designated driver " campaign			0
today , @entity66 expect the " designated driver " to social events where alcohol is served will not drink , but 25 years ago , before @entity93 's " the designated driver is the life of the party " campaign , this was not the case			0
working with physicians , politicians , advocacy groups such as @entity110 and even @entity112 celebrities , the @entity93 center engaged in " social marketing " that sold people on the idea of a sober driver			2
the center also elevated social expectations around problems such as binge drinking and violence , not via punitive bans and " sin taxes , " but by education and celebrity examples that helped to transform unhealthy activities into socially unacceptable activities			2
the ethical advantages of voluntary restraint over legislated behavior are clear			0
they can enhance a sense of community , and avoid the defiance that can sabotage well - meaning laws , such as tobacco taxes that spawn smuggling			1
moreover , the force of law can have disproportionate effects on segments of society : in this case , the obese are more likely to be poor people of color who can least afford the premium they will end up paying for their supersize drinks			1
@entity150 is an important ethical value , especially for freedom - loving @entity66 , and it should be preserved whenever possible			2
people should be free to make their own choices , from the clinical trials they join to the food and drink they consume , without duress and unmolested by the state			2
sometimes it is necessary to override free choice for the utilitarian " greater good of the community			0
" for example , some vaccinations are necessary , as are inspections of day care centers and restaurants			2
otherwise , the health of others could be seriously imperiled			0
but there are no parallel laws that compel diabetics or people in heart failure who prefer using natural herbs to take their medications			0
such laws might save lives but would violate the person 's right to personal choice , however foolhardy it appears			0
drinking oversize sodas falls into this category : the sugar - swiller is hurting no one but himself , and he should be persuaded , not compelled , to lay off			0
@entity5 attempts to convince us that the sugar consumers are hurting others , feeding urgency by declaring that the city spends $ 4 billion a year on medical care for overweight people			1
it is certainly a significant figure , but it means little unless it is compared with the cost of care for people of normal weight and for those who are underweight			1
some of the underweight also suffer from serious ailments that may raise their health care costs -- from anorexia to cancer to @entity208			1
some studies even find that overweight people can be healthier than the underweight			2
as for me , i 'm still puzzling the question of the five - year $ 116 million marketing monopoly that @entity5 gave @entity27			0
it failed to generate the anticipated income and fizzled out by 2009 , leaving one to wonder : " would sweetened ice tea still have been included in the ban if the contract with @entity27 had proved more profitable ? " on june 1 , the very day after @entity5 announced the soda ban , he championed supersize doses of sugar and fat when he proclaimed @entity224 , posing with enormous doughnut props			0
predictably , money changed hands as pastry maker @entity228 donated $ 25,000 to the @entity229			0
you ca n't make this stuff up -- as @entity5 should note			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity235 .			0

high - cigarette taxes have driven sales underground in @entity6 , ethicist says
persuading people of public health measures ' worth may be a better way to go , she says
@entity246 : medical care costs for obese need to be compared with costs for underweight
