@entity0 , who was playing in his first derby match for his boyhood club , scored his 21st and 22nd goals of an incredible breakout season after @entity3 fell behind controversially in the first half			1
coach @entity16 had raised the possibility that key striker @entity18 might recover from a hamstring injury in time			0
@entity18 did n't make it but former @entity22 star @entity21 , himself only recently returned from injury , skillfully fired home after @entity25 had fired the ball across the penalty box			1
replays showed that @entity21 was marginally offside			1
the setback did n't trouble @entity3 for long , who dominated for long periods as @entity7 conceded possession and played counter attacking football			1
@entity0 leveled the match after @entity7 goalkeeper @entity35 could only manage to parry a high ball in to the striker 's path			1
his second , however , was unstoppable			0
@entity0 rose highest in the penalty box to cleverly steer the ball back across goal and into the top left hand corner			1

@entity80 took a shock lead at the @entity82 , where @entity76 had been impenetrable until recently , when @entity83 fired home			0
the goal looked like it would secure @entity80 a vital three points , until @entity65 international @entity87 scored a late , late equalizer deep into injury time			2
whilst @entity76 will no doubt be happy to have at least salvaged a point , they will be less happy to have seen @entity77 pull seven points clear at the top of the table			0
