-- a @entity2 panel on friday said with 95 % certainty that the effects of climate change are real and largely man - made			1
to which pretty much everyone in @entity7 , @entity8 , said ... well , duh			1
if only they were n't so polite			1
the tiny @entity11 in near - @entity8 -- which i was lucky enough to visit on a reporting trip in 2009 and which is home to some of the sweetest and most colorful people you 'll meet -- has been watching climate change happen to it for years now			1
locals see the sea ice forming later each year , the coast eroding and the permafrost melting			1
the hunting seasons have shifted and lakes have dried up			1
the coast had become so unstable that one house toppled off the edge of the barrier island that harbors the village			1
when i was there , the town was considering relocating to more stable ground			1
now those plans seem to have dried up , too			1
@entity34 , the mayor of @entity7 , told me by phone thursday that residents have tabled their plans to move the town			1
another is that they were unable to find a suitable location upon which everyone could agree			1
potential relocation spots also are hit by the changing climate , he said			1
" the island is only a quarter - mile wide by three miles ( long ) , probably narrower now			2
i do n't know how long we 'll be able to be on this island , " he said			2
" these floods get pretty fierce now , worse than before			2
" it should seem laughable in 2013 that anyone would try to deny the reality of climate change , which is causing tougher droughts , stronger storms , rising seas and melting ice			1
the effects are scattered , to be sure			1
it 's difficult to attribute any single storm to macro-changes in the atmosphere , for example			2
but it 's clear things are changing			2
it 's clear that 's for the worse			2
and it 's clear -- has been clear -- that we 're to blame for that			2
i 'm thankful the @entity73 continues to update all of us on the latest science and evidence			1
but it 's already obvious to everyone paying attention that we need to act in new and profoundly urgent ways to blunt the future impact of climate change , and to mitigate the changes that are already taking shape all over the world			1
the @entity87 and other @entity89 nations that could be swallowed up by rising seas have banded together to try to make their economies 50 % or 100 % renewable			2
the urgency is clear to them			2
but in the @entity99 , we 're still running around with our eyes shut			2
sure , president @entity101 has tried , between arguing for strikes on @entity103 and trying to resurrect the middle class , to make climate change a front - burner issue			1
but @entity107 has n't followed suit			2
@entity99 remains a serious laggard on climate action			1
perhaps we should open our eyes , and turn them to @entity8			1
there , the evidence is like a slap in the face			1
a wake - up call			2
" the town is coming apart , getting smaller and smaller			2
" that 's @entity118 , a 68 - year - old who lives , with his wife , @entity119 , at the very edge of the @entity7 coast , which has been thawing and falling into the sea			0
a multimillion - dollar @entity124 project has bought kokeok some peace of mind			0
the engineers piled rocks high on the shore , as if imploring the land to stay			0
but even the engineers know that the measures are temporary			0
the @entity124 in @entity8 had $ 45 million to deal with coastal erosion issues that are related to climate change , according to @entity135 , chief of planning for the @entity137			1
that money ran out though			0
the rock wall in @entity7 was planned to be nearly twice as long as it is , but money is now only available if the village can put up 35 % of the cash needed to build it			0
i 'm pretty sure a place where people hunt seals for food and harvest ice for water does n't have millions to spare			0
it 's a beautiful , generous village			0
but not a rich one			0
the wall , as it stands , likely will buy @entity7 several years			0
but much already has been lost			0
when i visited him four years ago , @entity118 told me he blames the death of his youngest son , @entity155 , on the changes to the climate			1
@entity155 fell through a thin sheet of ice on the first week of june several years ago			1
that area should have been frozen solid , @entity118 said			0
he told me , back in 2009 , that he has n't been the same since			0
i was pleased to hear on thursday that , after two knee replacements , @entity118 was able to go caribou hunting with his grandchildren and daughter this summer			0
that 's something he had n't done in years			0
the land here , and the community , means so much to him			0
another community , @entity169 , which was the subject of a fascinating series by @entity172 , is actually in the process of relocating now , according to @entity135			1
@entity175 , a colleague of @entity135 's , told me that the permafrost is thawing out from beneath the town , making it nearly unlivable			0
" some of the boardwalks are underwater during the summertime , " he said			0
" you ca n't step off the boardwalk and walk anywhere without getting wet up to your crotch and covered in muck			0
you can see that when it floods now , houses that were above the flood level now get water in them or are surrounded by water and ( you ) ca n't go anywhere			0
... it happens slowly , over years and years			0
" slowly , over years and years			0
but still , impossible not to notice			0
i could think of a few senators i 'd like to send up to that village to wade in the muck			0
maybe it would alleviate their nagging sense of industry - funded doubt			0
or , at the very least , they 'd have to make excuses in a ruined pair of pants			0
