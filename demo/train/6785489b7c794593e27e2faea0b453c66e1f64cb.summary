-- purebred @entity2 stallions dominate the world of endurance horse events , but it is increasingly likely that the rider guiding them to glory will be a young woman			1
the @entity9 is the hotbed of equestrian 's fastest growing discipline , and new entrants to the top level of the sport such as 18 - year - old @entity16 are already upsetting the established order			1
" we love to challenge the men , " she told @entity0 's @entity19 , while fellow competitor @entity20 has another take			2
" the best thing is when you see the look on their faces when they pass the finish line , " @entity20 said			0
" it 's nice to see that they understand that the women here can challenge the men -- they can be as strong as men			2
" some 40 % of registered endurance riders are now women , and the bar has certainly been set high for the likes of @entity16 and @entity20			1
back in 2010 , @entity40 rider @entity39 won her second world title just seven weeks after giving birth to her first child			1
remarkable feat then 34 , she held off an all - powerful squad from the @entity9 to take the endurance championship at the @entity47 in @entity48			1
riding her @entity2 wonder horse @entity50 , @entity39 successfully defended the title she won two years previously in @entity52 and added to her @entity54 title of 2009 , becoming the first rider to achieve that triple			0
@entity39 could soon be facing challenges from young @entity9 women from the @entity9 , where traditional cultural barriers are being eroded			1
@entity60 is typical of the emerging riders who are pushing for acceptance			2
" there might be some people who are sticking to the tradition that a woman ca n't be a rider , but nowadays so many of us are riding here in the @entity9 and the @entity70 , " the 28 - year - old told @entity0			1
she is one of 15 women being trained at the stables owned by @entity74 , the brother of @entity76 's ruler @entity75 -- so recent developments truly have royal consent			1
@entity75 is the backer of one of the highlights of the region 's endurance racing season , the @entity84			1
the field of top international riders for the 2013 edition had a strong contingent of women entrants			2
@entity91 's views " women are getting more and more interested in this race , " @entity75 told @entity0			1
and can they compete at the same level ? " yes , yes definitely ! " came the reply			0
as the reigning world endurance champion , @entity75 is certainly well placed to make that judgment			1
he rode the 11 - year - old @entity98 -- trained by @entity39 's husband @entity100 -- to victory at @entity102 in @entity103 last august			2
@entity39 , riding the evergreen @entity50 , was relegated to fourth place as the @entity75 covered the 160 - kilometer course in treacherous and wet conditions at an average speed of 22.82 kph			1
according to @entity109 , the racing manager at @entity74 's stables , women have riding skills ideally sorted to endurance riding			2
" men and women are different , " he told @entity0			0
" the girl is softer , she pulls the horse , she pulls gently and the horse will understand , ' oh she will not hurt me			0
' " he will slow down for her , but the man when he hits the horse , pulls the horse back and horse will pull him back hard , if you pull the horse hard , you will lose energy and the horse will lose energy			0
" perfect partnership @entity39 knows the importance of forming the perfect partnership between rider and horse , in this case her beloved @entity50			0
" he 's a winner , i think he was born as a winner			2
even if he 's tired , when another horse challenges him , he will go until the end , " she told @entity0			0
her last big success at the @entity54 championships in 2011 was a particular highlight			0
" there was a lot of pressure and a lot of people said that he could n't do it , that he was n't good enough for the mountains or something like this , " @entity39 said			0
" i do n't know why but i enjoyed it a lot when i crossed the line			0
i was really really happy to win			0
" she and her trainer husband are already searching for the new breed of champion horses and have a growing stable of contenders			0
" flat races last minutes but top endurance races can last all day			0
the key is stamina and arabians are genetically built for it , " @entity164 said			0
royal family @entity39 and @entity50 had been trying to match the record of @entity172 @entity171 , who claimed the first three stagings of the world endurance championships in 1988 , 1990 and 1992 riding the legendary @entity175			1
but it may well be that a young @entity9 will be the next woman to impress at the highest level			1
@entity75 's daughter @entity179 won the @entity181 race in @entity76 last month , beating 63 rivals			1
her brother @entity183 won the world endurance championship in 2002 aged just 16			1
@entity16 has also been a dominant figure in the women - only events and her mentor @entity109 believes she has the ability to go all the way			2
" she 's tough , strong , she pushes herself over the limit , and that 's what you need in endurance , " he said			2
" @entity16 braved a sandstorm to win gold at last year 's @entity199 and has placed second and third key races against men			0
" it is perhaps only a matter of time before she joins the likes of @entity39 on the top step of the podium at the highest level .			0
