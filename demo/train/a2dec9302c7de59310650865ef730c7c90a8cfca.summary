@entity0 -- despite a high - profile push from pop star @entity3 and other gay rights supporters , the outcome of a key @entity7 vote tuesday on whether to begin debate on legislation that includes a repeal of the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy remains too close to call			1
@entity13 appear united against the measure , including some @entity13 senators who favor lifting the @entity17 's requirement that gays and lesbians keep their sexuality a secret			2
the @entity13 opponents are upset that @entity24 leaders so far refuse to allow @entity13 amendments to the broader @entity26 that includes the " do n't ask , do n't tell " provision			1
@entity3 spoke at an afternoon rally in @entity29 to pressure the state 's two @entity13 senators -- @entity32 and @entity33 -- to join @entity24 in overcoming an expected filibuster attempt			2
to loud cheers from the crowd , @entity3 said she was proposing a new law titled , " if you do n't like it , go home , " which would remove homophobic straight soldiers from the military instead of gay soldiers			0
" if you are not honorable enough to fight without prejudice , go home , " she shouted			0
without the support of the @entity29 senators , @entity24 are unlikely to muster the 60 votes needed to proceed with debate on the defense authorization plan			2
both oppose the policy , and @entity55 was the sole @entity13 vote in the @entity57 in support of getting rid of it			1
but in a statement issued monday night , @entity55 said she would side with the rest of the @entity13 because the @entity24 leadership of the @entity7 " intends to shut @entity13 out of the debate			1
" @entity55 said she agreed with the chairman of the @entity65 , adm. @entity66 , that the law is " simply not fair			2
" but she said senate majority leader @entity68 , @entity69 , should give @entity13 and @entity24 " an equal opportunity " to offer amendments to the defense bill			1
" now is not the time to play politics , and i again call on the majority leader to work with @entity13 leaders to negotiate an agreement so that the @entity7 can debate the defense bill this week , " @entity55 said			1
in a separate statement , @entity32 also indicated she would support a @entity13 filibuster , saying the chamber should be allowed a full debate on the measure			1
@entity32 also questioned why the @entity7 would vote on repeal before the military has completed its review			0
" we should all have the opportunity to review that report which is to be completed on december 1 , as we reevaluate this policy and the implementation of any new changes , " @entity32 's statement said			0
the defense authorization act , which is a broad defense policy bill , would not rescind " do n't ask , do n't tell " until after the @entity17 completes a review of the repeal 's impact on the military			1
the review is due in december and would serve as the basis for necessary certification by the president , defense secretary and chairman of the @entity65 that the military could handle repealing the policy			2
many @entity13 complain that @entity103 should not step in until after that military review is completed			0
sen. @entity105 of @entity106 , the top @entity13 on the @entity57 , said approving a repeal provision before finishing the review process would amount to an insult to military personnel			1
@entity105 also is unhappy that senate majority leader @entity68 , @entity69 , opted to include in the defense bill a controversial immigration provision that offers a path to citizenship for students who are children of illegal immigrants			1
@entity68 " is turning legislation on our national defense into a political football , " @entity105 said last week			2
" politically controversial amendments are crowding out our limited time to debate actual military and defense - related legislation			0
" a @entity13 leadership aide criticized @entity68 for planning to debate the " do n't ask , do n't tell " and immigration amendments before the @entity7 breaks for mid-term elections , even though @entity68 has said a final vote on the bill would not happen until a post-election session			1
" the vote tomorrow is not to get on the defense bill , it 's to set up a series of votes on a political wish list , " the aide said			0
@entity68 denied last week that his scheduling was motivated by politics			0
defense secretary @entity140 and adm. @entity66 , the @entity65 chairman , have said publicly they support repealing " @entity143			0
" the military already has working groups looking at how it would implement the change if ordered			0
the groups are looking at everything from housing to entitlements , and even personal displays of affection			0
@entity1 's @entity152 contributed to this report .			0
