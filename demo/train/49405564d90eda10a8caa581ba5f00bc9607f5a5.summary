few parents are delighted to learn that their daughter is a porn star , even a highly successful one			2
but for 21 - year - old @entity4 of @entity5 , a family dispute has taken on international dimensions			1
@entity7 is @entity8 's highest - ranked adult star			2
but she is also @entity10 - born -- and her chosen line of work has not only disappointed her parents but generated huge controversy in her native country			1
the debate has gained such a head of steam that some @entity20 news outlets published a family statement this week condemning @entity7 's actions and expressing the family 's regret about her fame as a porn star			1
she is also criticized for her tattoo , in @entity28 , of the opening lines of the @entity30			2
" we are probably paying the price of living away from our homeland ; our kids had to adapt to societies that do n't resemble our culture , traditions and values , " the family statement said			1
" hence , we emphasize that we disassociate ourselves from her actions which do not reflect her family beliefs , her upbringing or her true @entity10 roots			1
we hope that she comes back to her senses as her image does not honor her family or her homeland -- @entity10			1
" according to the statement , @entity7 , born in 1993 , moved with her family to the @entity53 in 2000			1
they left behind them one of the more liberal countries in the @entity57 but one where religion plays a central , sometimes divisive , role in daily life and many are deeply socially conservative			2
having turned 18 , @entity7 left home , the statement says , " as is common in the @entity64			2
she married an @entity53 guy in february 2011 and is currently living with him in @entity5			1
@entity4 has since lost contact with her family			1
" despite the family rift , @entity7 has been doing well for herself			1
and she 's been fighting back against the criticism on her @entity73 feed , which has more than 100,000 followers ( and contains some slightly nsfw content )			2
she writes : " @ borenstein_alex : @ miakhalifa how do we achieve peace in the @entity57 ? " stop talking about pornstars that are n't living in your country " but many critics continue to voice their disgust on @entity73			2
" i am a @entity84 patriot and what you are doing is shameful , " one person wrote			2
another says her head should be cut off for what she 's doing			0
and that 's far from the only death threat she 's received			0
she posted a doctored photo that appeared to show her as a prisoner of @entity97			0
at the same time , she has many online supporters			0
@entity100 - @entity10 author and publisher @entity99 posted at length in her defense on his @entity105 page			1
" the moral indignation about @entity4 , presumably the first @entity10 pornstar , is wrong for two reasons			1
first and foremost , as a woman , she is free to do as she pleases with her body , " he wrote			0
" secondly , as a sentient human being with agency , who lives halfway across the world she is in charge of her own life and owes absolutely nothing to the country where she happened to be born			0
there is this odd perception that being @entity10 is a vocation and a duty first and that your personal life comes second			1
" and like @entity124 , @entity99 believes the fevered interest her actions have stirred back home is unwarranted			0
" for the record , i do n't think we should be particularly proud of @entity4 , we should just be indifferent			1
she 's doing a job she chose , in a regulated industry , no different to banking			0
actually , it 's probably more regulated than banking			0
" i certainly do n't think she 's our last frontier against @entity97 as some have suggested			0
she is a 21 - year old in @entity5 who has made a decision for herself , with absolutely no wider implications			0
" another boost came from @entity53 duo @entity142 , who recorded a song about her this week , posted to their @entity73 feed			1
it 's already proven pretty popular with her fans , with several posting that , together , she and the band " broke the internet			0
" and @entity7 herself remains defiant in the face of the trolls			0
" how does it feel to be the most hated arab at the moment ? " she wrote			0
" @entity157 good since @ @entity142 wrote a song about me			0
" @entity1 's @entity159 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 moved with her family from @entity10 to the @entity53 as a child
" we are probably paying the price of living away from our homeland , " her family says
