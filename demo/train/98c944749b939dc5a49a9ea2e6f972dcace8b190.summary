-- @entity1 was the artsy town @entity3 would travel to on weekends , a respite from the bustle of @entity8 's capital , @entity9			1
but when a colleague with the @entity11 organization returned from once - scenic @entity1 on friday , @entity3 said he was traumatized			1
" he said it 's horrible what 's happened there , " said @entity3 , the emergency health and nutrition director for @entity11 in @entity8			1
" people are lost , dead , missing			1
houses are down and facilities are down			1
it sounded similar to what we 're seeing here in @entity9			2
" attention has focused on @entity9 since tuesday 's 7.0 - magnitude quake , as it is the country 's most populous city -- at more than 1.2 million people -- and has suffered tremendous devastation			2
thousands of homeless victims have taken to sleeping in the streets , without food , water and medical attention			2
others are buried beneath the rubble , and rescuers have miraculously pulled out survivors who were entombed by the debris			2
elsewhere , though , preliminary reports are telling of how the crisis has gripped residents beyond the capital			2
" what we 're hearing from text messages , from e-mails is that all along the coast going west and then down south , towns are absolutely destroyed , " said @entity3 , who has worked in @entity8 since 1999 and spoke to @entity0 from @entity9			1
she learned of the extent of the damage from colleagues , people on the street and other aid groups			2
just to the west of @entity9 is @entity58 , a city of 442,000 that felt violent shaking during the quake , according to the @entity63			1
damage there is expected to be heavy -- reports have yet to come in , the agency said			2
west of that is @entity69 , a city , like @entity58 , that is passed on the road to @entity1			1
more than 30 miles further west of the capital is @entity73 -- all towns , @entity3 said that are reeling from the quake			1
@entity69 's main hospital was flattened , as were numerous other buildings , @entity3 said			1
she said she heard the " whole town had collapsed			0
" among the other areas , she said she was told an orphanage full of 1,500 children collapsed , and many people were dead or missing			0
@entity0 has yet to independently verify damage or casualties outside the capital , but reports continue to build in bits and pieces			0
about a three - hour drive south of the capital in @entity1 , there were reports of an orphanage that toppled , and of a hospital for women that collapsed , said @entity97 , spokeswoman for @entity98 , a film school in @entity1			1
staff at the school and students there have written @entity103 about the dire situation in that city , and even shot footage of buildings ripped open and survivors lying in streets			0
to keep the lights on and communication open , the school has had to rely on a generator after power lines went down			0
the home of the school 's editing teacher , @entity115 , fell down a hill when the earth violently shook , and many others lost their homes , @entity97 said			0
just east of @entity9 , makeshift camps have been erected in the public squares of the densely populated area of @entity125 , @entity98 founder @entity121 told @entity103 in an e-mail shared with @entity0			1
@entity127 described a harrowing scene on the road to @entity9 : " moving into the city ... the destruction gets worse and worse and the street is lined with piles of swollen , rotting bodies			0
... periodic road blocks have been set up by residents , protesting the lack of any aid presence and angry at stench and indecency			0
huge tractors and dump trucks were just beginning to arrive and load bodies as we passed thru			0
" @entity147 @entity146 logistics expert and relief worker @entity145 said the biggest obstacle outside the capital was getting medical treatment to the injured			0
chaperone arrived in the capital wednesday and had driven east toward the border with the @entity155 to escort an @entity156 into @entity8 , said @entity146 spokesman @entity157			0
@entity152 told @entity157 that about 30 minutes out of @entity9 , he was still seeing significant and widespread damage			0
medical care was limited , as local clinics were overwhelmed by demand , he said			0
makeshift treatment facilities were established for those who fled the capital , many of whom had broken bones and other serious injuries , @entity152 said			1
exacerbating the dangerous situation was the reality that medical supplies were running out			0
roads are slowly becoming easier to navigate , but aid is still slow to get outside the capital			0
@entity3 said that her team plans to travel as far as they can to assess the situation and offer help			1
" there really needs to be a humanitarian response and it needs to be immediate , " she said			1
" outside of @entity9 there really has n't been anything			0

@entity1 , @entity69 , @entity58 and @entity73 are towns that are reeling from earthquake
@entity188 , makeshift camps have been erected in public squares
humanitarian response " needs to be immediate , " says @entity3 of @entity11
