a $ 50 million settlement has been reached in connection with the deadly collapse of a stage at the @entity4 , a lawyer for injured survivors and relatives of those killed said friday			1
the incident occurred august 13 , 2011 , when a strong storm packing winds estimated by the @entity10 of 60 to 70 mph rolled through just before @entity14 , the country music duo of @entity12 and @entity13 , was set to perform			0
authorities took the stage to warn the crowd to seek shelter at one point , due to the rough conditions			2
four minutes later , speakers and metal scaffolding fell into the " @entity22 , " a section usually occupied by @entity14 's most ardent fans			2
five people died soon after the collapse , with two more succumbing later to their injuries			0
scores more were injured and survived			0
the $ 50 million settlement reportedly includes $ 11 million that had been previously paid out by the state of @entity31			1
it also " resolves the claims arising from the seven deaths and over 58 injuries against 19 of the 20 defendants in the case , " according to @entity38 , whose firm represented many of the victims and the families of those killed			1
@entity38 said the terms of how the $ 50 million will be distributed are being kept confidential , but noted that " all of ( his ) clients are gratified to reach a conclusion and pleased by the settlement			1
" he also noted a historical distinction of the settlement : " for the first time in the state of @entity31 -- and to our knowledge in the @entity53 -- a lesbian widow has received a settlement for the wrongful death of her wife			2
" @entity38 was speaking of @entity58 , a well - known figure in @entity62 's @entity61 community who died in the collapse			0
@entity66 's domestic partner and executor , @entity68 , will receive compensation as her surviving spouse			0
" it 's a legacy particularly befitting of ( @entity66 ) and i 'm sure she 's proud of it , " said @entity38			0
the settlement was reached with 19 companies			0
there 's still a case out against one remaining defendant : @entity79 -- a company that employed a guard who was among those killed -- that " will likely go to trial in 2015 , " @entity38 said			1
two investigative reports released in spring 2012 found that the scaffolding was not up to standards and the @entity4 did not have adequate emergency planning in place			1
the findings were presented by representatives from the firm and officials from @entity92 , a public safety and crisis management consulting group			0
at the time , then - @entity31 gov. @entity94 promised to implement the reports ' recommendations even as he insisted his state fair was n't much different from many others			1
" it 's ... now clear that most , if not all states , have been deficient in this area and have much to learn from this tragedy , " @entity94 said then in a statement			0
earlier that year , the @entity31 @entity104 announced penalties totaling $ 80,800 following a worker safety investigation into the collapse			2
the largest fines -- totaling $ 63,000 for what the agency said were three " knowing violations " -- were levied on @entity112 , which built the stage structure and leased it to the fair .			1

scaffolding collapsed around an @entity4 stage , killing 7 and injuring dozens
victims and kin of those killed agree to a $ 50 million settlement in the case
a separate case against a security company working the fair is continuing , law firm says
earlier reports found the scaffolding was n't up to par ; emergency plans were *inadequate*
