-- @entity1 will face pre-tournament favorites @entity3 in sunday 's final of the @entity5 after both countries won their semifinals 1 - 0 on wednesday			1
substitute @entity8 scored the only goal 12 minutes from time as @entity1 shocked another one of the title favorites , @entity12			1
meanwhile , a superb individual goal from @entity15 striker @entity14 proved enough for @entity3 to see off @entity16 in @entity18 's capital @entity19			1
@entity20 quarterfinalists @entity12 , who lost to @entity22 in the 2010 african final , squandered a host of chances , missed a penalty and had a player sent off in @entity28 , @entity29			0
and the @entity12 were made to pay for not taking advantage of their superiority when 20 - year - old striker @entity8 fired home from outside the penalty area			1
four - times champions @entity12 started the match strongly and should have taken an eighth minute lead when @entity38 fouled @entity39 in the area			0
but @entity41 wasted the resulting penalty when his poorly - struck spot - kick was pushed away by goalkeeper @entity44			0
soon afterwards , @entity41 shot straight at @entity44 after being put through by @entity45 , whose younger brother @entity46 also fluffed a great chance to score			0
@entity12 continued to have the majority of the possession after the break , but @entity8 's superb strike gave @entity1 a lead they held onto			1
@entity12 's woes were compounded by the dismissal of @entity55 with seven minutes left for a second bookable offense			2
a contender for the goal of the competition from @entity15 striker @entity14 against @entity16 put @entity3 into the final for the first time since losing to @entity22 in 2006			1
picking the ball up on the halfway line , @entity14 left a host of @entity16 players in his wake as he sprinted down the left wing before firing a shot past goalkeeper @entity69 into the far corner of the net			2
looking to avoid the same fate as @entity12 earlier in the day , the elephants nearly took a fifth - minute lead when @entity76 's shot struck the crossbar			2
and , just seven minutes later , african player of the year @entity78 also struck the bar after being set up by @entity76 's @entity81 clubmate @entity80			0
@entity82 had @entity16 's best chance in the 72nd minute , but his attempt from the right narrowly whistled over the crossbar .			0

@entity1 stun favorites @entity12 1 - 0 to reach the final of the @entity5
substitute @entity8 scores the only goal with 12 minutes remaining
@entity1 will face @entity3 in sunday 's final after the elephants beat @entity16 1 - 0
@entity15 striker @entity14 's superb individual goal is enough to *defeat* *co-hosts*
