@entity0 -- all eyes were on the problem - plagued @entity4 website monday after the administration said it would smoothly handle most users following its botched launch two months earlier			1
@entity9 spokesman @entity8 told reporters that 375,000 visitors went to @entity12 by 12 noon et , almost half the total daily capacity of 800,000 that officials announced sunday as a result of a round - the - clock effort to fix the site			1
however , @entity8 provided no details about how many of those visitors were able to sign on and enroll in insurance exchanges set up under president @entity22 's signature health care reforms			0
a new function created in the latest technological overhaul completed sunday put people trying to sign up in an online waiting queue if capacity exceeded demand			0
they could wait until their turn came to enter the system , or ask to receive an e-mail when they could try again at the front of the line			0
three @entity1 journalists who attempted to sign on monday ended up in the new queue around midday and then two hours later			0
their wait lasted a few minutes before they received a prompt on their screen to proceed with enrollment			0
later in the day , users proceeded directly to enrollment without waiting , indicating reduced volume at the end of the afternoon , as officials had predicted			1
having declared the site working as intended on sunday , the administration effectively painted a target on it for detractors led by conservative @entity52 , who will look for any anecdotal evidence of continued problems with the @entity55			1
the @entity56 wasted no time monday , distributing a list of media reports that noted administration officials warned people to expect continued glitches with the problem - plagued online portal			1
" president @entity22 and his administration repeatedly claimed the @entity4 website would be fully functioning by the end of november , but this has proven to be just another broken promise , " said @entity56 chairman @entity63			1
" the @entity22 administration had over three years to build @entity12 , and all they 've produced is a non-functioning website , wasting hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars			1
" administration : we met the website deadline obamacare site fix : 5 things to look for @entity8 made clear more glitches were likely in coming weeks and months , arguing that any major website has periodic problems that must be addressed			2
" it does not mean that there will be no problems with the website going forward , " he said when asked by reporters if @entity12 was truly fixed or merely functioning at a minimal level			1
to @entity8 , the bottom line was that as of monday , " more people are visiting the site and are able to effectively go from beginning to end " compared to the unsuccessful launch in october and through november			2
on sunday , officials announced they had met their self - imposed november 30 deadline for getting the site working for the " vast majority " of users , saying response times and error rates had been slashed while capacity increased			2
@entity99 , a former administration official brought in to oversee the website fixes after its launch , compared the hardware upgrades so far to widening a highway on - ramp from two lanes to four			2
that means chronic breakdowns , error messages and delays users experienced two months ago when the website went live have mostly disappeared , he said , noting the average response time was less than 1 second and the system 's " uptime " -- a measure of system stability -- was consistently surpassing 90 %			0
it all means that @entity12 can now handle its original intended volume of 50,000 concurrent users for a total of 800,000 visitors a day , according to @entity99			1
upgrades , trouble - shooting , and old pizza in a commentary in @entity126 , health secretary @entity127 advised consumers to try the website in off - peak hours -- mornings and evenings on weekdays or else on weekends -- and noted the new feature for times of high demand " that allows users to opt to receive an e-mail when it 's a better time to come back			0
" she emphasized that consumers have time to sign up , with a december 23 deadline to get coverage that starts on january 1 and a march 31 enrollment deadline to avoid a financial penalty for not having insurance in 2014			0
back - end problems remain insurers : site glitches persist meanwhile , insurers warn that more work is needed on the " back - end " functions of the website that process payments and provide enrollment information to the companies			1
" insurers are still getting enrollment files that are duplicative and have missing or inaccurate information , " @entity158 , spokesman for health insurance industry trade association group @entity159 , said in a statement to @entity1			0
" in some cases they are not getting the enrollments at all			0
" the administration chose to stress the positive on monday with a statement saying november enrollment figures on @entity12 were expected to be higher than the previous month			1
an administration official familiar with the matter told @entity1 that about 100,000 people signed up for coverage last month alone on the site			2
the official cautioned the number was preliminary and final numbers would be released in mid-december			2
@entity177 , a @entity178 spokeswoman , said enrollment through alternate channels and successful exchanges in 14 states would help bolster november figures			1
in october , the first month of a six - month enrollment period , just over 106,000 people signed up for @entity4			1
less than 27,000 of them did so through the @entity12 website , which was supposed to be the main enrollment portal			1
initial enrollment figures lower than hoped website progress garners muted reaction from @entity192 @entity193 , the official charged with implementing @entity4 as director of the @entity195 , told a congressional hearing last month that the administration initially hoped to enroll 800,000 people by the end of november			1
the overall enrollment target by march 31 is 7 million			0
a properly functioning @entity12 is crucial to implementing the most vital provisions of the health law that require people to have health coverage			2
in theory , the law would create large pools of younger , healthier participants whose premiums would help offset the cost of providing care for older policy holders who use the health care system more			0
the program must convince younger people who might be less inclined to pay for coverage they do n't think they need			0
to @entity52 opponents , the law needs to go			2
they focused on canceled coverage for some individual policy holders as an example of how @entity22 and @entity223 failed to fulfill a pledge that people could keep health insurance they liked			0
@entity4 playbook : spread negative perception " this is n't just about a broken website , it 's about a fundamentally flawed law , " said @entity228 , spokesman for @entity9 speaker @entity229 , while conservative @entity230 sen. @entity230 of @entity231 said monday the administration lied to the public about the health care reforms and other issues			1
" that 's the one thing i find most aggravating about what 's happening in @entity0 these days , particularly about this administration , which is a lack of accountability and the willingness to mislead people or provide them just demonstrably false information and expect to be able to move on , " @entity230 said during a @entity240 online conversation			0
@entity250 : premiums influenced by state roles another @entity52 attack line -- that people are paying more for their health care under @entity4 , despite @entity22 's claim that costs would go down -- may depend on where they live , according to a @entity250 report			1
in @entity261 and @entity262 , state regulators challenged the premiums that insurers wanted to charge for @entity4 policies , forcing the companies to lower their rates , said the report by @entity1 's @entity269			2
but in states like @entity272 and @entity231 , regulators took a hands - off approach , allowing premiums that insurers filed to sail through			0
like most things @entity4 , the treatment was infused with politics , with several states run by @entity223 more active and public about negotiating with insurers while some @entity52 - led states disassociated themselves from the process			1
rate reviews by states have proved effective in lowering premiums , according to a study last year by the @entity288			0
the average rate allowed after a review was 2.6 percentage points lower than the average rate initially requested in the individual market , though there was a wide variation between states			0
" if states were more aggressive in reviewing rates , you saw more of a decrease , " said @entity297 , policy analyst at @entity288			0
@entity22 : people do think i 'm trustworthy @entity1 / @entity304 poll : are @entity4 's flaws fixable ? high court to hear @entity4 birth control case @entity1 / @entity304 poll : @entity22 's marks for management , trustworthiness take hit @entity1 's @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 and @entity316 contributed to this report .			2

like all websites , some continuing problems will occur , officials say
@entity52 continue *relentless* attacks on @entity4
