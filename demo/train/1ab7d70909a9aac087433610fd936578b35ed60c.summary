-- at home i drink from the tap			2
not so much because i particularly love the taste , but because the automatic water dispenser on my fridge does n't work			1
this , of course , is the primary job of any automatic water dispenser			1
every fridge i 've ever owned			2
i 'm actually starting to think it 's all a giant conspiracy orchestrated by the evil hydration overlords at @entity14			2
do n't let their cute little water pitchers fool you			1
though , perhaps my fridge just needs a new filter			2
that could also be it			2
regardless , swapping one out would require two full minutes of my life and minimal effort			2
so , really , it just makes more sense to ignore the problem and continue living my delightfully mediocre existence			2
" hooray ! everything is only decent ! " fortunately , i really do n't mind the flavor of what 's coming out of the tap			1
it 's more or less fresh and clean			0
and , most importantly , new			0
because according to a trending science story floating around the interwebs , we now understand that the oldest known water on the planet tastes absolutely " terrible			1
" there 's far more to the story than just that			0
but the big headline everyone seems to be talking about online is the fact that this really old , prehistoric water shockingly does n't taste like a mountain spring			1
in a recent interview with the @entity48 , @entity49 , a science professor from the @entity51 , described having a sip			0
" what jumps out at you first is the saltiness , " she explained			0
" it has the consistency of a very light maple syrup			0
( @entity61 ? maple syrup ? ) anyhow , the water , which for years has been bubbling up from a zinc and copper mine in @entity66 , @entity67 , was only recently dated by scientists who calculated its age to be anywhere from 1 billion to 2.6 billion years old			1
which is quite a wide range			0
" what a cutie ! how old is your daughter ? " " @entity77 , she 's definitely somewhere between 3 and 67			0
" the point here is that this water is really old			1
and it does n't particularly care for kids these days , what with their video games and rap music			1
amazingly , the liquid has been trapped in granitelike rock fissures 1.5 miles underground where it 's happily lived beneath the dirt			0
and as @entity49 studied it seeping up within the mine , scientific research eventually led her to taste it			1
" we are interested in the saltiest waters because they are the oldest , " she told the @entity48			0
" tasting is the quick - and - dirty way to find which are the most salty			0
" @entity49 did , however , insist that she does n't let her students do it			1
which shockingly goes against all human instinct to experience something disgusting and then immediately encourage others to do the same			0
" @entity103 ! this cheese tastes like a truck - stop men 's room			1
here , @entity106 , have a bite			0
" prior to scientists discovering the approximate age of the ancient water found in @entity60 , the previous record holder came from a @entity113 gold mine			1
but the water there was only tens of millions of years old			1
however , what 's really exciting about all this is that , like the @entity113 water , the @entity60 liquid might be capable of containing life despite its incredible isolation deep within the earth			1
i seriously hope it 's overrun with @entity125			0
of course , what we 're actually talking about is tiny microbes			1
which , generally speaking , i do n't particularly care for			2
if you 've ever dined on bad street meat in @entity131 , @entity132 , you know that some of these little bastards mean business			0
" yeeeeeah , we 're here from that rat you just ate			0
if you could spend the next five days near a toilet , that would be great			0
" @entity49 speculates that it will take about a year before they can confirm whether or not anything 's actually living down there in the fissures , but positive results could have implications that reach beyond even our own planet			0
" scientists have found evidence that there was once water on the surface of @entity153 , " she explains			2
" it could be that there is water trapped in rock hidden deep beneath the planet 's surface in the same way the water was trapped in the ancient rock in the @entity66 mine			1
" until then , for the next year or so , all we can really do is enjoy the fact that one brave , friendly scientist tasted horrible prehistoric water so the rest of us did n't have to			1
follow @entity170 on @entity171 .			0

water bubbling up in a mine in @entity67 is between 1 billion and 2.6 billion years old
scientist who sipped water says it tastes " terrible "
researchers are still trying to determine if the water could contain microbes
one brave scientist tasted horrible prehistoric water so the rest of us did n't have to
