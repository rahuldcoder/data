-- watching the premiere of " the @entity2 ! " -- the @entity4 movie about a high - level @entity6 mole at a large multinational company -- was the mole himself , @entity10			2
@entity10 , right , at the premiere of ' the @entity2 ' with @entity4			2
the movie is a dark comic take on the three years @entity10 -- a former divisional president of @entity12 , the @entity13 - based food additive giant -- spent working undercover to break a global price - fixing conspiracy			1
@entity10 recognized real episodes in his life on the big screen , such as trying to fix a hidden tape player during a meeting and his delusional belief he would be made ceo of the company as a reward for his undercover work			0
but what you wo n't see in the movie are the events of august 9 , 1995 , six weeks after an @entity6 raid blew the case into public attention			2
it was two days after @entity12 fired @entity10 and accused him of embezzling millions from the company			1
his @entity6 partners for the previous three years would no longer speak with him			0
on that day , @entity10 sat alone in his car with its engine running inside a closed garage and slowly lost consciousness			0
he was hoping to end his life as surely as he had ended his career			0
a gardener found him unconscious			0
some scenes just ca n't be played for laughs			0
" there was nothing comical in the reality of the story , " said @entity10 , who eventually spent nearly nine years in prison for his role in the price - fixing scheme and revelations he siphoned off $ 9 million from the company while he was working for the @entity6			1
for @entity10 , ' the @entity2 ! ' is a study in his own mental illness , as he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after hospitalization for his suicide attempt			0
his meeting with @entity4 at the premiere was the first time the pair met			0
@entity4 told him he hoped they portrayed his illness in a sensitive way , @entity10 said			0
" he did n't want to talk to a 52 - year - old @entity10 while preparing for the role , the @entity10 who went to prison , who has been treated for bipolar disorder , who is now coo of a company , " said @entity10 , who is now an executive for a small food supplement maker			2
" he wanted to portray the 35 - year - old @entity10 , otherwise it would make it difficult to portray the delusions i had at that time			2
" the fix is in for companies and regulators , the 1997 conviction of @entity12 was a landmark event , the first antitrust action in the @entity13 since @entity81 and a case that has spurred price - fixing investigations around the world			1
" as a result of this case , the @entity87 and the @entity6 started looking around to see if they could find any other cases like this , " said @entity85 , a retired @entity6 agent who supervised the undercover @entity12 work			1
" this used to be relatively unusual until the ( @entity12 ) case came to light , " said @entity92 , a @entity93 researcher on cartel activity , who was an expert witness in the government 's case against @entity12 " back in 1993 you 'd see maybe one or two global ( price - fixing schemes ) being discovered ... in the past three years or so , there are about 50 a year			1
" price - fixing schemes -- where a cartel of manufacturers inflate prices against market demand -- cost consumers untold millions each year			1
in the @entity12 case , it was found that in the three - year period of investigation the company 's cartel activity with manufacturers in @entity115 and @entity116 inflated prices by at least $ 200 million			1
the @entity12 case resulted in a record $ 100 million fine in 1997 -- a figure long since dwarfed			1
last month @entity115 company @entity119 agreed to pay $ 26 million for its role in price - fixing lcd panels used in mobile phones in the @entity13 several other companies , including @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 , have already pleaded guilty in the case and paid fines of more than $ 600 million			1
just last week , the @entity130 government fined @entity131 , @entity132 and seven commercial banks a total of $ 10.4 million for price fixing bank fees ( @entity131 and @entity132 are appealing that decision )			1
flawed heroes a sign of cartel activity is usually a sharp and uniform increase in price with a contraction in demand			2
" but , in fact , in the last 15 or 20 years ( governments ) have relied almost exclusively on whistle - blowers to make their cases , " @entity92 said			1
and as @entity10 showed , whistle blowers often do n't have noble motives			1
" the movie should be taken very , very seriously , " said @entity151 , a cpa who turned government witness against his employer in the 1980 's			0
" in white - collar cases , the governments have to rely on informants ... in effect , relying on unsavory characters to make their case , " said @entity156 , who now advises government agencies on white - collar crime			1
" what happened in ' @entity166 , ' is he had an agenda to become head honcho of the company , " @entity156 said			0
" the mistake the @entity6 agents made in the movie is they fell in love with their witness			0
it turned out there was a dark side they did n't know about			2
" @entity10 said he began stealing millions from the company while working for the @entity6 , in part , as a financial backstop in case things went wrong			2
" i had this sense of false entitlement , like they owe me this ... after all , the company was stealing hundreds of millions			0
" the stress of his double - life undoubtedly added to his mental woes , said @entity85 , the original @entity6 supervisor in the case			1
he points out that undercover @entity6 agents receive surveillance training and are pulled for psychological evaluation once a year -- @entity10 received none of that			0
" there were no provisions for similar checks and balances with @entity10 , " @entity85 said			0
" he had no ideas what he was getting into when he agreed to cooperate ... we had no idea it would last three years			0
" although @entity10 has served his time , @entity85 and other agents involved in his case are seeking a presidential pardon			2
" he really screwed up by stealing , " @entity85 said			0
" be that as it may , how many hundreds of millions would have been stolen if ( @entity12 ) was n't stopped by @entity10 ? he is a national hero , in my eyes			1

the @entity12 price - fixing case was a landmark in global antitrust *prosecution*
global price - fixing investigations have *skyrocketed* since the @entity12 scam
these investigations depend on whistle - blowers who often have dark motives
