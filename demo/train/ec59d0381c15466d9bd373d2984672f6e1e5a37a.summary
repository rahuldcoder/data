we 're talking about code : an integral part of our lives , but something that most people have no idea about the workings of			1
@entity14 meets @entity15 , co-founder of @entity16 -- a company that teaches people how to code in just one day			1
@entity19 : what spurred you on to launch decoded ? @entity15 : we started the company with a very simple but challenging mission : could you teach anyone and everyone to code in a single day ? taking someone from zero skills , zero knowledge and zero confidence to these words that we use all the time -- digital enlightenment			1
@entity19 : why is it so important for people to learn to code ? @entity37 : code is the building block of the world around us today			1
technology is transforming every single industry all our lives are being rapidly affected by the pace of technological change -- it 's the languages of billions now			2
but how many of us can say that we truly feel confident or empowered by the technologies behind the screen ? we all should be understanding and feel confident of those technologies , whether you want to become a programmer and developer or you simply want to lead a business that 's being transformed by technology			2
@entity19 : @entity16 has taught more than 2,000 different businesses how to code			1
what does the program entail ? @entity37 : when somebody comes to a decoded course , they are asked to do no pre-work ; nothing			0
everything is prepared for you , usually in a wonderful space because we believe that space is conducive to good learning			0

we want to get you coding as soon as possible			0
essentially , you build an app in a single day using languages including javascript and html , and you get to think like a developer , think like a computer and break down problems			2

@entity19 : are there lost causes when it comes to spreading digital enlightenment ? @entity37 : the only lost cause when it comes to teaching coding to someone who thinks : " i 'm driving the car : why do i need to understand what 's under the bonnet ? " that 's something that i used to hear quite a while ago and it does tend to be , if they 're asking that question or saying that it probably means that they 're leading a business			0
if you 're leading a business at the moment , the one thing that is erratically changing your business right now is technology : in terms of skills , in terms of your consumers , in terms of the marketplace that you exist in			0
it 's not so much that i wash my hands of those people , i just worry about the future and where they might be in three years ' time			1
@entity19 : what is @entity16 's biggest challenge ? @entity37 : it 's how can you actually condense six months , a year -- even twenty years of knowledge into a very short period of time			1
but we kind of relish that challenge , and it 's always a barometer for us			0
and the great thing about technology is that when you understand it and feel empowered by it , anything is possible .			0
