-- there are indications that the man believed to have killed the head of the @entity6 prison system this month may have been released from prison early because of a clerical error			1
@entity9 entered the @entity10 in february , 2005 , sentenced to three years in prison on robbery and menacing charges			1
in june 2005 , facing more charges , @entity9 was sentenced to eight years for assault and three more years for menacing , both concurrent to the original sentence , meaning he could get out in eight years total , in 2013			1
while @entity9 was in prison , he assaulted a prison guard			1
@entity0 affiliate @entity20 in @entity21 says it has copy of @entity9 's plea agreement from 2008 , for that attack			1
the station broadcast on friday an enhanced portion of the document , which states , in part , " the parties stipulate to a sentence capped at four years in the @entity10 to be served consecutively to any sentence the defendant is presently serving or has yet to serve			1
" that word " consecutively " should have added four years to the end of the sentence , so @entity9 could n't get out until 2017			1
but something apparently got lost in translation			0
by the time the court order , or mittimus , reached the @entity10 , it did not specify whether the latest four - year assault sentence should be concurrent , or consecutive			1
" the deal i made is it was consecutive , " @entity40 , who prosecuted @entity9 as the deputy district attorney in @entity42 told @entity0			1
" is there any way it could be automatically changed without me being involved ? i do n't know of any			0
any changes for good behavior reduction would be the jurisdiction of @entity51 , not me			0
once somebody is committed to the @entity51 , then the exact aspects of the sentence are in the jurisdiction of the @entity51 " " there 's very strict case law , " corrections department spokeswoman @entity55 told @entity0 on saturday			1
" we 're not bound by the plea deal			0
the @entity10 is bound by the court order , bound to follow what 's directed on the court order			2
if the court order is silent ( does not explicitly say ' consecutive ' ) , we 're required to treat it as concurrent			1
" questions , speculation noted @entity21 - area attorney @entity67 , who represented @entity9 in four cases from 2003 to 2005 , but did n't speak to him over the past eight years , told @entity0 he could not know what happened until he sees a transcript of the sentencing hearing			1
but it 's easy to imagine a scenario where " a very small clerical error , compounded by understandable judicial oversight , ended with disastrous consequence , " he said			0
" we know there 's a written plea agreement signed by @entity40 and a deceased public defender			1
it clearly states ' consecutive ' but does n't say consecutive to what , " he said , after reviewing the documents in @entity20 's possession			1
" it does n't mention prior cases			0
it should have mentioned consecutive to which prior charge			0
" @entity67 said usually one clerk types up the " minute orders , " which is the in - court record of the judge 's oral orders , and a clerical error could happen then			2
next , sometimes the same clerk , but often a second clerk , who may not have been in the courtroom , types up the mittimus , the formal court order that directs corrections offers to commit someone to prison , and something could get lost in translation there			2
" he may or may not read them ' @entity67 said a mittimus order has a place for the judge to sign it , so clerks prepare them and a judge signs them , and that 's the next time a clerical error could happen			0
" he may or may not read them			0
if you look at this mittimus , it looks utterly normal , nothing to draw his attention , and the judge signed the order , not realizing no language about consecutive , " he said			0
" in @entity6 , the judge can not change plea agreements from consecutive to concurrent , though a judge can choose to reject any plea agreement he wants , " @entity67 said			1
" knowing that plea agreement called for consecutive sentencing and knowing no judge has power , there 's a strong likelihood sentencing went through as contemplated with consecutive sentencing ... routine resolution of a minor prison guard assault case			1
the judge may not have specifically said consecutive , though probably did			0
whoever prepared the minute order probably dropped the ball -- just did n't say anything			0
" ' this is an educated guess ' " that was it			0
@entity51 is stuck with signed court order , " @entity67 suspects , adding , " this is an educated guess			0
" while judge @entity150 signed the mittimus , it 's unclear who oversaw the sentencing hearing			0
@entity40 said two judges , one man , and a female judge @entity156 were both involved in @entity9 's case			1
@entity0 left messages at phone numbers for both @entity160 and a judge @entity156 in @entity42 , but received no response from either			2
' a troubled young man ' of @entity9 , one thing sticks out in @entity40 's mind : " he was a troubled young man			2
" @entity67 said if his theory is correct , the domino effect is mind - boggling			0
" if you were writing fiction , you might have trouble understanding this thing to be true			0
catastrophic for three families -- the @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity9 families , " he said			2
" what 's really agonizing about this situation is it was an utterly routine plea bargain			2
a mundane task a judge undertakes every single day			0
here we are five years later looking at the wreckage that was the result of those errors			0
" @entity174 was shot to death at his home outside @entity186 on march 19			0
@entity9 was killed two days later in northern @entity187 in a gunbattle with authorities that left a sheriff 's deputy wounded			2
last week , a 22 - year - old woman appeared in court to answer charges that she purchased the gun that @entity9 used in the killing of @entity196 and pizza deliveryman @entity175			1
authorities have said the bullets that killed @entity174 came from a gun that was found with @entity9 , who had handwritten directions to the prison chief 's house in his car			1
investigators also found a pizza box and a pizza delivery uniform jacket that they believe links @entity9 to the death of @entity175 , who worked as pizza delivery driver			2
authorities have speculated that @entity9 may have killed @entity175 for his uniform -- to use it as a disguise in the killing of @entity174 , who was gunned down after he opened his front door .			2

@entity0 affiliate @entity20 says it has a copy of @entity9 's plea agreement from 2008 assault
it says @entity9 was sentenced to four years ' consecutively , ' which should have been added to his prison term
official court documents did not specify ' concurrent ' or ' consecutive ' so prison officials made the sentence concurrent
@entity9 was released in *january* , and is suspected of killing the prison system chief in march
