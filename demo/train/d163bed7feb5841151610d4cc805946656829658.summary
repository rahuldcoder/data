-- sailing around the world is one of the most grueling challenges on the planet , with muscle - bound skippers steering 20 - meter yachts through everything from tropical cyclones to @entity10 storms			1
forced to endure the most brutal conditions on the globe , sailors must not only be emotionally resilient -- but physical dynamos			2
which raises the question : are women -- the stereotypical " weaker gender " -- up to the task ? organizers of the @entity21 -- the prestigious round - the - world sailing competition -- seem to think so , and are gearing up for the first all - female team in over a decade			1
this one 's for you it will be an emotional campaign by the 11 - woman @entity27 ( @entity29 ) , who last month lost their coach @entity31 to a stroke			1
" people say it 's the toughest race there is in the world but it 's much more than that			1
it 's big waves , icebergs , it 's incredible team spirit			1
you want to win but of course you have bad days and sometimes you hate it , " @entity44 veteran sailor @entity31 told @entity0 , before his death			1
" this race is incredibly physical			2
the stronger you are the better it is -- you get an advantage over the others if you are stronger for sure			0
" everest of sailing the all - women team will be allowed three more sailors than their male counterparts , in their bid to win one of the toughest sporting competitions in the world			1
dubbed the " @entity64 , " the @entity21 covers 72,000 - kilometers in an epic nine - month journey across the globe			1
launched in 1973 , the race claimed three lives in the first year alone			2
" it 's very physical and it 's definitely become a lot more physical over the years -- the sails are getting bigger , the boats are going faster , " three - time race winner , @entity72 , told @entity0			1
" it 's just harder work , so the more big guys the better			0
" women doing it for themselves the last time an all - female crew took part was in 1997 , finishing ninth out of 10 boats			1
this time around , the ladies are more determined than ever to cross the finish line first , and are busy training in @entity85 , @entity86 , more than a year ahead of the race in october , 2014			1
five of the crew have already been chosen , and include an elite line - up of former @entity92 competitors and international world champions			2
among them is briton @entity95 , who in 2008 finished fourth in the @entity96 -- a non-stop , solo circumnavigation renowned as the toughest sailing competition on the planet			2
the 38 - year - old 's most recent attempt at the @entity96 earlier this year lasted just six days , after her mast collapsed			1
the crushing disappointment forced her to look for a new challenge			0
" when something unexpected and unwanted happens it 's really hard			0
you always have to learn from your mistakes and learn by your problems and come out stronger and so that 's what i 'm doing , " @entity95 told @entity0			0
" the @entity114 — e @entity96 is my project , i 'm my own boss and i do everything on the boat			0
there are so many things that i have been questioning -- such as whether i 'm capable of getting into a project where i 'm not the boss anymore , " the mother - of - one added			2
from heartbreak to hero ? also in the crew is another yachtswoman reeling from professional disaster , and hoping to make good in 2014			0
a year ago , 33 - year - old @entity129 was training for the @entity130 with only one thing on her mind -- to win a medal			1
but her three - person - crew , who had won a world title in their @entity92 build up , did not deliver , instead finishing sixth			2
" i do n't think i 'll ever forget that moment , " @entity129 told @entity0			0
" i had a lot of belief in the way we campaigned but it was one of our worst ever performances in a regatta			0
" " that disappointment will always be with me			0
i 've chosen not to go back and try and settle that straight , but to do something new and this is something new			0
" future females one thing is for sure , win or lose , these gutsy ladies are throwing sailing stereotypes overboard			0
as @entity29 managing director , @entity156 , said : " they are all very talented natural sailors -- gender does not come into it			0
" " it would be great to think that we could engage a new generation of women to break into competitive , crewed offshore racing			0
a female team in this race should be the norm , not something unusual			1

first all - female crew in over a decade gears up for tough sailing race
@entity21 kicks off in october next year , women 's team already training
*significant* race follows *sudden* death of coach @entity31 last month
