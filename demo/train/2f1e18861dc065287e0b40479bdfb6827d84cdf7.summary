-- @entity1 has backed off an online spat with humor blog @entity3 after getting withering web feedback for shutting down a drive to buy holiday gifts for children in need			1
and the online payments service is even chipping in to help buy a few more gifts after temporarily shutting down the @entity12 fund because the for - profit site was running it			1
" ( @entity17 ) e can confirm that the funds have been released and we are working directly with the account holder on this matter , " a @entity1 representative said via e-mail			1
" we are also making a donation to @entity3 to help families in need this holiday season			1
we 're very sorry this occurred			0
" run by actress - comedian @entity3 , @entity3 is a snarky blog created primarily to mock what it considers awkward , ugly or otherwise head - turning offerings on the arts - and - crafts site @entity32			1
but , perhaps in a bid for some good karma , the site maintains a charity fund that has given money to causes from breast - cancer research to @entity32 community members in need			1
last month , @entity3 , who uses the pen name " @entity3 " on the blog , put out a call for community members who knew of children at risk of not getting gifts this @entity48			1
on december 1 , she announced that 200 children had been approved and put out a call for donations -- one that she wrote raised thousands of dollars in a few hours			0
" you people make me sick , " she wrote , mocking , as she frequently does , the tone some @entity32 users take when they find their work has been featured on @entity3			1
in just a few hours			0
we now have enough money to make gifts to the families , as well as these kids			0
good job a- - holes			0
" then came the trouble			0
on monday , @entity3 wrote that @entity1 , which was processing the donations , shut down the drive because she had used a " donate " button that she learned is only for nonprofit groups			1
she said she had a " very long and jaw - dropping conversation with an incredibly condescending representative , " who told her she had to refund donations			0
she wrote she hatched a plan to return the donations , then " sell " the toys that had already been purchased to the donors , only to be told that , too , violated @entity1 rules			2
@entity1 said it has clear guidelines for any business that uses the service to collect donations			2
( the statement did not directly address whether @entity3 had violated those guidelines , saying it ca n't comment directly on accounts due to privacy policies )			2
the representative said such guidelines are required by law			0
" we appreciate that this can be an inconvenience , but we have a responsibility to all our customers -- both donors and recipients ; or buyers and sellers , " the @entity1 rep said			2
" in this instance , we recognized our error and moved as swiftly as possible to fix it			0
" in a post tuesday afternoon , @entity3 thanked her supporters			2
" i would also like to say that i did not expect this kind of global outpouring of support , and i truly believe that had you not all made your voices heard , no one from @entity1 would have ever felt compelled to make this right , " she wrote , noting that " @entity3 " had become a top trending topic on @entity106			1
" there is no real support or appreciation for the consumer anymore			0
the customer is always wrong			0
" i am extremely grateful to all of you for your efforts			0
if @entity1 is sincere about allowing us to make these gifts , you will have made a difference for 200 children and their families this holiday season			2
" in an email later tuesday to @entity0 , @entity3 said she 'd had an " encouraging " conversation with @entity1 and that they were still discussing a donation to the fund			1
after responding to a @entity0 request , @entity1 's blog was updated with a post with the same statement , attributed to @entity137 , director of communications .			1
