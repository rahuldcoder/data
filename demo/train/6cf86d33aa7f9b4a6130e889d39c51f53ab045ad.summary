@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's 10 minutes after the final whistle has blown but still no one knows whether their efforts have been in vain			1
the @entity10 national soccer team sit in the dressing room at the @entity12 -- in @entity0 , a small copper mining town on the @entity1 - @entity14 border -- quietly waiting for news amidst the fog of sweat and redolence of rubefacient muscle rub			1
the team has just drawn 0 - 0 with @entity1 in their final qualification match for the @entity22 , a qualification campaign that began with the country under the rule of colonel @entity25 , continued through the civil war and ended before the death of the former notorious leader			1
@entity29 was needed to be sure of progression to next january 's tournament in @entity32 and @entity33			2
a draw meant that results elsewhere had to go their way			0
as their campaign for @entity40 's biennial continental championship progressed with war as the backdrop , some players declared the team was behind @entity25			1
others left the team to go and fight on the front line with the rebels			1
in unison , somehow , they qualified ; news that will shortly be relayed to the team when confirmation of results from other matches are circulated			2
six days earlier coach @entity54 is in good spirits in the lobby of his hotel in @entity58			0
the security situation is such that the team could not train in @entity61			2
the @entity63 coach once famously won the under 17s and under @entity65 in the same year for his homeland , but signed for @entity10 in june 2010 when the @entity67 was run by one of @entity25 's sons , @entity70			1
" when i was there the first time i contacted only the federation , then one time i have one meeting with dr @entity70 , " @entity54 explains of his dealings with the @entity25 regime			0
" he was happy because of the project i made for the national team and @entity10 football			1
i focus only on sports			0
at that time you do n't know about the country			0
" in the past , the @entity25 family 's dealings with soccer and its players had been much more hands on			1
his son @entity89 played for @entity90 and installed himself as captain of the national team			1
the team plummeted to 186th on @entity95 's rankings			1
but they also used soccer as a political tool			2
in 2000 @entity89 's @entity90 traveled to @entity99 for a league match			2
@entity101 had long been associated with @entity10 's opposition and the team 's fans paraded a donkey wearing @entity89 's shirt			1
" it is a bad story , not a funny story , " says 29 - year - old defensive midfielder @entity107 , the current captain of @entity99			0
" the first half , @entity61 are winning			0
but the referee is no good			0
so @entity99 goes to the airport [ in protest ]			0
@entity114 turned up with his dogs and the police and said : ' if you do n't play the second half , we will kick you '			0
" unsurprisingly , the players returned to play the second half , and lost 3 - 0			2
colonel @entity25 was so incensed that he ordered @entity99 's training ground to be destroyed			2
the club was also banned from domestic competition for five years			0
when @entity128 released a " red notice " for @entity114 in september , the allegations given were " misappropriating properties through force and armed intimidation when he headed the @entity67			0
" @entity132 's early results were encouraging			2
@entity10 beat @entity1 , one of @entity40 's best teams , in @entity61			1
but then in february civil war broke out , dividing the players			1
after @entity10 had beaten the @entity139 in march the team 's former captain , 34 - year - old @entity137 , declared that the players were 100 per cent behind @entity25			1
he even labeled the rebels " rats and dogs			2
the 27 - year - old midfielder scored in that game but when the team gathered again in june , he decided to leave the camp and fight for the rebels when he heard a friend had been injured in the violence			1
" some people come to me and told me one of my dear friends was in the hospital and lost his arm ... in that moment i decided to leave the camp and join the front line ... in @entity159 , " explains @entity144			1
life on the front line was hard			1
friends would shield him from worst of the fighting until , in the end , he felt he had no choice " when i was there i was just about forgetting about football because the most important thing then is how to secure your life and secure the life of your friends			2
if it was about me i would never come back , you would never find me here playing football			2
but ... my friends on the front line told me : ' this is your future , you must go there			1
this is also like a war for you '			2
" others left for the front line too , like goalkeeper @entity181 , but not all were so lucky			1
@entity183 was shot in the shoulder and spent a month in hospital before returning to the front line			1
by the end of august @entity25 had been toppled			0
a week later the team had to play their penultimate qualifier against @entity189 behind closed doors in @entity191			2
aside from the trouble of getting the players out of the country , there were some more practical concerns			0
for one , @entity54 had to hold a clear the air meeting with the squad			0
the old @entity200 players were nowhere to be seen			0
a new kit had to be designed , with the rebel 's flag stitched on to it			0
the @entity10 fought out a 0 - 0 draw			1
" the last game [ against ] @entity189 , it had a big impact on the people in @entity10			1
everyone was happy and everyone was talking about us , " recalls @entity144			0
" we will do everything to qualify , @entity213 , because this will help our country too much			0
at least to bring them some happiness after all the sadness they have been through			0
" the journey south to @entity1 took almost 24 hours , but the players are ready when they take to the pitch at the packed @entity12			1
@entity10 's new captain , 39 - year - old goalkeeper @entity223 is the hero , making three world class saves			1
the match finishes 0 - 0			0
some of the players collapse on the floor in tears			0
others pray before returning to the dressing room			0
the quiet is broken when one of the coaches bursts in and breathlessly delivers the news			0
the blue - painted room erupts in celebration and song			0
@entity240 national anthem is sung as the new flag is held aloft in the center of the melee			0
@entity245 's victory and a last - minute equalizer for @entity32 against @entity247 means that @entity10 has , against the odds , qualified for the @entity249			1
as a nation recovers thousands of miles away from the ravages of civil war under the new interim government , @entity250 leads the celebrations and the chants			1
" the blood of the dead , " they sing , " will not be spilt in vain			0

@entity2 travels with the @entity10 national soccer team to @entity1
the team 's campaign to qualify for the @entity266 *coincided* with @entity10 's civil war
several of the players had fought on the front line for the rebels
the @entity266 is one of the biggest tournaments in world football
