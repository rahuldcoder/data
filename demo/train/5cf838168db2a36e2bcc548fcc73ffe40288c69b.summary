a new court ruling could chill @entity2 's plans to drill for oil off @entity4 , finding that federal regulators used an " arbitrary and capricious " number to approve the project			1
the ruling from the @entity9 comes as @entity2 is gearing up to resume its on - and - off oil exploration project in the @entity11			1
the project has caused widespread concern among environmentalists and native alaskan communities , who have gone to court to stop the drilling			2
the judges found the federal government used " an unrealistically low estimate " of the amount of oil @entity2 might be able to produce when calculating the project 's impact on the @entity26 environment			1
officials with what was then the @entity29 , the @entity30 agency that handled oil and gas leases , estimated the potential amount of recoverable oil at 1 billion barrels			2
but other estimates ranged much higher -- up to 12 billion barrels , according to the ruling			0
wednesday 's split decision by a three - judge federal panel sends the matter back to a lower court in @entity4 for further review			1
" today 's ruling is a victory for the @entity26 , " the plaintiffs said in a joint statement			1
" the government has no business offering oil companies leases in the @entity11			2
" @entity2 had no immediate comment , with spokesman @entity50 telling @entity51 that it is still studying the decision			0
@entity53 , a senior attorney for the @entity54 , said the @entity59 administration " ca n't in good conscience authorize @entity2 to do exploratory drilling under those leases			1
" " the decision says the government has no idea what the real impact of leasing will be , " @entity53 said thursday			0
" until it knows those impacts , it ca n't decide whether to proceed with the leases , and it has no business letting @entity2 continue to operate under leases that the government is going to have to reconsider			1
" both the @entity71 @entity70 and the @entity72 had questioned the 1 billion figure before @entity2 's lease sale was approved in 2008 , the decision states			1
@entity53 said @entity2 's authorization for the @entity26 project " was all predicated on a lowball estimate of production			1
" " sometimes courts do find legal technicalities that void something , but do n't really change the underlying situation			0
that 's not this case , " @entity53 said			0
" it 's a really profound problem with the whole operation , and not the kind of thing you an paper over and fix on the quick , " he added			0
the @entity54 is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit			0
the @entity29 was reorganized after the @entity95 disaster in the @entity96 in 2010			0
its successor agency , the @entity97 , had no comment on the decision			0
but in court , the agency argued that its 1 billion - barrel figure may be too high , because " the remoteness of the area and the risk of economic failure " may mean no oil gets produced at all			0
@entity2 has invested billions into its @entity26 oil plans and began preparatory drilling in september 2012			1
but the project soon hit several high - profile snags , including the grounding of a drill barge that was being towed back to the @entity114 at the end of the season			0
the company skipped any effort to drill in 2013 , but has filed plans with @entity97 to resume work again in july as the case winds through the courts			2
@entity2 's plans also were delayed by the @entity95 disaster , which killed 11 rig workers and unleashed an undersea gusher in the @entity96 that took three months to cap			1
@entity2 says it 's working at far less depth and lower pressures than those involved in that accident			2
the shrinking of @entity26 sea ice , which hit record summer lows in 2012 , has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region			2
climate researchers say that decrease is a symptom of a warming climate , caused largely by the combustion of carbon - rich fossil fuels like oil -- a conclusion that 's politically controversial but accepted as fact by most scientists .			0

the @entity71 " has no business letting @entity2 continue " after ruling , lawyer says
@entity71 used " unrealistically low " oil estimates to ok @entity2 's @entity26 leases , court says
the company plans to resume drilling off *northwestern* @entity4 this summer
*opponents* urge the @entity59 administration to reconsider @entity2 's permits
