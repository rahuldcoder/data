-- " you are my duchess " was one of the first catcalls @entity5 wrote down in 2008 , after she got into the habit of jotting down the unwanted attention she received from strangers in the streets of @entity11			1
something about it seemed so " dated , " she said , and it stuck with her			1
so would many more of the icky comments from strangers , prompting her to keep a running log of them			1
most of the time , she does not respond , and the callers usually seem annoyed by her silence			1
when she has responded , the outcome is usually , " ' who , me ? what did i do ? how dare you respond to me like that ? ' " she recalls			2
" i never understood what the callers really wanted to get out of it			2
" finally , she decided to do something with them			2
she began cross-stitching them into samplers in what she calls an effort to reduce " the complex emotional experience " of being taunted with harassing , vulgar sentiments into " a simple piece of women 's work			1
" a sampler is a decorative piece of embroidery , traditionally included in a hope chest , that demonstrates proficiency in needlework			1
it also requires a lot of time and concentration			2
" i wanted to laboriously and painstakingly give attention to all these phrases that were verbally thrown at me in a moment , " she said			2
" @entity52 made sense to me because of its connotations and how it historically references women 's work			1
i also liked the idea of how laborious it was			0
that these statements would stick to me or be in my mind for a very long time			0
" she has created 32 samplers for the series , " you are my duchess			1
" she started out with simple words			1
now she creates designs around the words , in what she calls the " beautification " of an assault			0
" the first time i made one , well , i just sat down and started			0
then i wondered why i was doing it because it was going to take so long			0
at that point , looking at one little embroidered phrase that had taken me 8 - plus hours to make , well , i wondered how far i would get doing it			0
i just wanted to have a large collection of them			0
" the more i did them , the bigger and more detailed i wanted them			0
now , if i want to start one , i can not help but think big			0
@entity82 is good , but it takes a long time			0
" what 10 hours of street harassment in @entity11 looks like			1

@entity5 cross-stitched harassing comments into 32 samplers
the series is called " you are my duchess "
the samplers reduce street harassment into a " simple piece of women 's work "
