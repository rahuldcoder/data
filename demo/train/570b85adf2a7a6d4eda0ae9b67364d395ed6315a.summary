the decision comes as @entity12 , whose december arrest and strip search in @entity15 strained ties between @entity7 and @entity17 , headed back to @entity4			1
@entity19 spokeswoman @entity18 said she hopes this will help gain closure in the incident			0

allegations denied federal prosecutors allege @entity12 promised in the visa application , under which her housekeeper moved from @entity4 to the @entity1 , to pay her at least the minimum wage in @entity15 , and to require she work no more than 40 hours per week			1

through that post , she was accorded " the privileges and immunities of a diplomatic envoy , " the @entity43 said			0
two senior @entity1 officials said that the @entity19 had no choice but to grant @entity112 full diplomatic immunity once she was accredited to the @entity106 because she did not pose a national security threat , which is the only reason for which , in very rare cases , immunity is denied			0

secretary of state @entity149 expressed " regret " about the situation last month , but stopped short of saying authorities had done anything wrong			0
@entity1 law enforcement officials have said that @entity12 's strip search was standard procedure and that she received a number of privileges not usually accorded to defendants			1
