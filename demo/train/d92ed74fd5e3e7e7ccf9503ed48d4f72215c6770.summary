-- as scenic drives go , the @entity1 is not a bad one			0
squeezed into a two - mile circuit looping around the streets of @entity6 are views of the world - famous casino , five - star hotels , a-list celebrities and a splash of the azure waters of the @entity14			1
the principality on the @entity16 covers less than a square mile -- just half the size of @entity20 's @entity19 -- but its legendary grand prix weekend packs a sensual punch despite its diminutive size			0
" it 's special , " two - time @entity1 winner @entity24 tells @entity0			1
" you 've got the ocean , the background of the cliffs ... if they ca n't build a nice bit of road in @entity35 , where can they do it ? " it 's an unparalleled experience that stimulates all five senses for all involved			1
sight from the open cockpit of an @entity43 car , hitting top speeds of 176 mph , the 22 drivers who line up for sunday 's race have a unique perspective on @entity35			1
" starting the lap you see the apartments , the five and six - storey buildings around the outside of the track , " explains @entity24 , who finished his @entity43 career with world champions @entity48 last season			1
" you drive very close to the @entity57 , the top of the @entity59 then , when you come along the harbor , you know there 's water on the left and boats			1
" the drivers do see things from a very different perspective -- if you went around the track sitting on a little skateboard then that is the same height we 're at in the @entity43 cars			1
you know all these sights are there but you do n't see much of them			0
" the squeezed crowd on the sidelines gets closer to the racing action than at any other @entity43 circuit in the world , and the @entity1 is almost as famous for people - spotting as it is for the racing spectacle			1
the four - day weekend attracts a 200,000 - strong crowd as racing fans , royals and the rich and famous mingle in @entity6 , peering from their pews on hotel balconies and yachts , grandstands and roadsides			1
smell @entity93 , a three - time race winner in @entity35 between 1956 and 1961 , remembered cheekily waving at female fans as he drove around the principality			1
" when i won there in 2012 i could literally see the crowd standing up out of their seats in the last few laps , " recalls @entity24			1
" another classic thing about @entity35 for me was recognizing some of the photographers as they 're standing inside the barriers taking photos			2
" there 's been quite a few scenarios when you actually spot someone you know ! on other tracks you do n't see that			0
" hearing racing around @entity6 's elegant , legendary circuit is not just a visual sensation -- the magic of @entity35 piques each of the five senses			1
" you might get a bit of the salt water , " says @entity24 , pondering whether there was a particular scent in the @entity35 air			1
" i actually always thought it was cooler through the harbor section of the lap because you got a bit of a sea breeze -- but maybe that was a driver clutching at straws on a hot race day ! " the echo in the tunnel is also very unique			2
the tunnel is quite low so the cars used to be very loud through there			0
" touch when it comes to the business of the race weekend -- points and podiums -- it is a racing driver 's instinct for feeling that is the sense that counts the most			2
an @entity43 car may have high - tech sensors on every corner funneling information back to the engineering boffins on the pit wall , but no machine can understand what it feels like to grapple with the exacting streets of @entity35 from the seat of the world 's fastest racing cars			1
" when you 're driving you feel it in your butt , hips and back , " reveals the 37 - year - old @entity24 , who put his body through 217 grands prix before moving to endurance racing in @entity164 sports cars in 2014			1
" you also pick up sensations through your hands on the steering wheel			0
" you 're constantly putting information in the library in terms of sensation , grip level and how close you can go to the barriers			0
" when you get out of the car after a couple of fast qualifying laps in @entity35 , your heart rate is probably as high as anywhere it 's ever going to be and you 're sweating a bit more			1
" you know what 's at stake , any small error and you 're going to pay a big , big price			0
" over the last six decades of the @entity43 world championship , there have been layout changes to @entity35 's street circuit but the precipitous , narrow racing roads remain largely unchanged			1
the odd drain cover and fence might have been replaced but , unlike the purpose - built racing circuits in @entity198 and @entity199 , there are no runoff areas or pace - slowing pools of gravel traps			0
if a driver loses concentration , he can find himself in the wall or following @entity208 's fabled 1955 dip into the @entity14			0
even the fearless @entity209 -- who won the @entity1 a record six times -- admitted to reeling in his racing instincts around @entity6			2
the @entity213 , who was killed in a crash at the 1994 @entity215 , famously spoke of entering a trance - like state as he attacked the @entity35 track			1
" i felt the circuit was no longer really a circuit ... i suddenly realized that i was over the level that i considered reasonable , " @entity209 said after dominating qualifying at the 1988 @entity1 , though he spun out late in the actual race while leading			0
" i think every racing driver can try to relate to what he was talking about , " @entity24 says			2
" he did some laps round there which were two seconds clear of the field , which is unheard of			0
" but at @entity35 , more so than anywhere , the most important thing is the next corner , so all of your energy and concentration to get the car on the limit through the next corner is incredible			2
" it 's going to drive you to that narrower focus point that @entity209 touched on a lot around there , because that 's what the track demands			2
" physically @entity35 is not that draining but mentally it is massive			2
" taste each year , the ability to master the senses in @entity35 rewards one driver with the sweetest sensation of them all -- quaffing champagne from the top step of the podium			2
" i 'm not big into the red carpet stuff , " @entity24 says with a dose of his down - to - earth @entity258 understatement			1
" but @entity35 is up there for us as drivers and as race teams			1
" you have the victory champagne on the race track , which is brilliant			2
we spray the champagne over the mechanics , whoever 's in sight			0
generally we try to spray the police but they 're a bit serious so we give them a nudge			0
" then we spray the car and the track			0
it 's how it should be , in my opinion			0
a lot of traditional things have been lost but @entity35 still has those in abundance			2
" to win in @entity35 is certainly worth a few victories			0
there are a few guys who 'd like to have that one -- and it 's certainly a proud moment for me			0
" the @entity1 remains one of the most challenging races for any driver but , odd as it may seem , the @entity43 cockpit offers a form of escapism			0
with charity football matches and fashion shows to attend , not to mention catching a skiff from one side of the harbor to the other , the drivers are in danger of sensory overload			0
" the first thing that hits you at @entity35 compared to other tracks is how claustrophobic it is , " adds @entity24 , who chose not to join peers such as @entity304 , @entity305 and @entity306 in making @entity35 his home			1
" it is a bit of a zoo because it 's such a small area and you have so many people there			1
" there are some quiet areas			0
on a friday i always went for a ride on my bike and got away from @entity35 altogether			0
" it 's difficult to explain to people who have n't been there , but you 've got to have tried pretty hard to get away from the chaos			0
" it may be the slowest , shortest , smallest grand prix of the year , but when it comes to epicurean delights and distraction @entity1 remains @entity43 's crown jewel			1
