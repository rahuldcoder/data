@entity0 -- think of president @entity3 's pivot from last week 's anemic job growth numbers to monday 's populist call to lower taxes for the middle class as the political equivalent of shifting an awkward dinner party conversation to a rousing comment about the home team 's last game			1
the president spoke from the @entity15 on monday surrounded by a group of middle - class families standing in rapt attention as @entity3 spoke of " rebuilding an economy where work pays off			1
" later in the day , the president was to echo his call to extend the @entity24 - era cuts to those making less than $ 250,000 a year during interviews with local and regional television stations and at a pair of campaign events			1
" right now our top priority has to be giving middle - class families ... security they deserve , " @entity3 said monday to applause			1
it was a decidedly more upbeat tone than on friday , when the president was hammered over a relatively stagnant job growth rate and an unemployment rate of 8.2 %			0
" @entity3 is saying consciously , ' i 'm going to change the direction of what i 'm talking about			2
really , here is my strongest argument -- i want people to hear that , ' " said @entity45 , who was a speechwriter for dozens of @entity48 political figures including vice president @entity49 and is author of " the @entity52 's companion			1
" @entity3 has hit the message reset button before during this campaign cycle			2
attention was diverted from a month of dismal economic news in june when he announced a temporary halt to deportation of certain young undocumented immigrants			0
the move knocked @entity64 strategists back on their heels and they scrambled to respond			0
but it 's a tactic with mixed results			0
republicans immediately pounced on the president 's call on @entity71 to extend the @entity24 - era tax cuts for those making less than $ 250,000 a year , describing it as " desperate			1
" @entity68 pointed out that the president 's call for the tax cuts extension is not new and accused the president of trying to steer the narrative away from last week 's dismal jobs news			1
there was no mention of monday 's event on the president 's week - ahead schedule update on friday , and the @entity3 campaign spent the weekend pounding @entity64 presidential candidate @entity87 on his overseas accounts			1
@entity87 's campaign also questioned the president 's timing , which was coupled with the release of an ad in key states attacking the presumptive @entity64 nominee 's stance on abortion			1
" it 's no coincidence that a day after a disastrous jobs report , the @entity3 campaign drops viciously negative and false ads against gov. @entity87 , desperate to change the subject , " spokeswoman @entity98 told @entity99			1
" the economy has gone negative on president @entity3 , so he has decided to go negative on @entity87			1
" both @entity3 and @entity87 have had hits and misses when it comes to trying to change the subject , said @entity110 , a @entity1 contributor and history and public affairs professor at @entity114 , who has written books on former presidents @entity24 , @entity117 and @entity118			1
" i do n't think @entity87 is very good at it			2
he 's best when he focuses on one topic -- the economy			2
( on that issue ) he 's extremely disciplined and extremely focused , " @entity110 said			0
" @entity3 is ok , but he has n't been successful at it			2
he has a lot of skills , but he does n't have the ability of @entity127 or @entity117 to change the topic			0
" " there are subtle ways to ( change the subject ) , " @entity110 said			0
" the most famous in that style was @entity117 -- @entity118 would be talking and he would say , ' there you go again			0
' " and sometimes , politicians just goof			0
last month , @entity3 said the private sector was " doing fine " compared to the public sector , comments he later tried to walk back			2
" when @entity3 did that private sector ad lib i 'm sure right after he just about bit his tongue off , " @entity45 said			2
" @entity140 with saying , ' i like being able to fire people			0
' " but @entity87 held his own during last month 's interview with @entity145 on @entity149 's " @entity146 " which touched on immigration , @entity45 said			1
" i think in that exchange he was pervasive and skillful			0
... you have to think not just how could he steer the conversation but what bad things did he avoid , " @entity45 said , adding that the thorny issue of immigration was full of potential pitfalls that could have come back to haunt @entity87			2
" @entity160 , who is skillful , with ( rep. @entity161 ) , " @entity45 said , critiquing the two politicians ' communication styles			0
" ... she kept reflexively going home to the statement she wanted to make			0
it looked like she had no ability to think on her feet			0
" @entity3 was able to successfully change the broader political conversation when he pushed for health care reform at a time when tempers flared over a bailout of many of the nation 's largest banks			1
the health care debate consumed public attention for more than a year , @entity110 pointed out			0
" a president can do that , for example , because that 's the bully pulpit			0
... the most dramatic way is to start a new legislative initiative in the middle of the campaign			0
... it can look like when @entity127 was being impeached and all of a sudden he 's bombing @entity188			0
" but most importantly , candidates can change the subject by offering something substantive , political experts say			1
to that end , @entity87 can recapture the conversation if he can shake criticism that he has no alternative plans to offer other than attacking @entity3			1
" @entity87 needs to say ' here 's a package or program to consider , ' " @entity110 said .			1

president @entity3 's call for a tax cut for middle class changed *dialogue* on economy
@entity3 and @entity87 have had hits and misses when switching political messages
political experts say offering substance over style always best when switching messages
