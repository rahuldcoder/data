-- the island nation of the @entity2 -- which markets itself as one of the world 's top luxury destinations -- faces uncertainty as the nation 's president resigns amid the threat of violence and a rising tide of @entity13 rhetoric			1
president @entity14 , a former dissident who was elected in 2008 under a platform of political reform , stepped down tuesday after members of the nation 's police force revolted against his government following weeks of political protests			1
" i believe if i continue as the president of the @entity2 , the people of the country would suffer more , " said @entity14 , before he handed power over to former vice president dr. @entity23			1
but on wednesday more violence was reported with the former president allegedly beaten along with members of his @entity31 , party officials said			1
@entity14 's supporters claim he was forced to resign at gunpoint			1
former @entity2 president beaten , his party says the resignation came after three weeks of opposition protests following the arrest of a judge , which ignited a constitutional crisis			1
but the political tensions simmering in the island nation gained global attention last @entity44 when @entity14 's government abruptly banned spas and sales of alcohol at resorts after allegations from opposition leaders of lax morals			1

how did spas cause turmoil ? one of the first signs of trouble came during the @entity44 holiday , when the @entity127 surprised the world by banning spas across the country			0
the move led to a standoff over tourists ' rights to have massages and skin treatments at the high - end resorts -- many of which charge thousands of dollars for a night 's accommodation -- and calls from opposition groups for a stricter imposition of @entity13 values in this @entity62 country			1
the situation came to a head after opposition groups staged a demonstration on december 23 in which they advocated , among other things , for a crackdown on massage parlors in the capital , @entity155 , and other densely populated areas			0
rather than ignore the demands , the government raised the stakes by issuing an order to close all massage parlors and spas			0

the government reversed its decision in early january			2

the @entity203 stepped into the fray , saying in late january that the government should release judge @entity186 or charge him of a crime			2
