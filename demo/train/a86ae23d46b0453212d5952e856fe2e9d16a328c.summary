-- it had been a little more than four months since completing my second space shuttle mission , @entity2 , on the shuttle @entity5			1
i was finishing my annual flight physical at the @entity7			2
the words from the flight surgeon were as expected : i was in great condition with nothing of note			2
then i asked the doctor to look at my right shoulder because my racquetball game was suffering			2
he asked if i had pain			2
i told him i was n't in pain , but my right arm did not swing naturally when i walked			1
this comment must have set off some alarm , because he observed my walk down the hall and quickly said he would take me downtown to the @entity23 the next day			2
i remember saying , " i do n't believe we can see an orthopedic surgeon that quickly			1
" he merely noted that we were going to a neurologist			0
little did i know that next day would change my life so quickly			0
the neurologist spent five minutes with me before saying that i had @entity30			1
he added i would have to undergo several separate tests to prove that i did n't have some other neurological disorder			1
parkinson 's disease is diagnosed by the process of eliminating other possible diseases			1
after several tests , the diagnosis was confirmed			0
beat goes on for music producer diagnosed with multiple sclerosis to their credit , the flight surgeons asked me what i wanted to do about flying			1
i quickly said i wanted to continue with all activities , including standing in line for another space shuttle mission			1
i kept my condition a secret to all , except my wife and my children			1
i assumed senior @entity54 management were told , but no one ever spoke to me about the disease			0
i continued my normal duties and was subsequently offered my third shuttle mission -- @entity61 , which included a planned space walk			1
the mission was highly successful			1
one year after that mission , i left @entity54 for a job in the private sector supporting human space flight			2
with the exception of my closest friends and family , i kept my condition a secret for almost 15 years			1
my reason for secrecy was simple : people did not need to know			0
now i 'm an advocate for @entity30 awareness			1
having parkinson 's disease is no reason to stop living life to its fullest extent			2
yes , as the disease progresses i have had to change the way i do certain activities , but i continue to do them			0
i have a keen awareness now of the stress my disease places on my loved ones who provide me encouragement and tender loving care			0
the caregivers to a person with @entity30 's are the people who give so much of their lives to care for a loved one			1
my wife is my caregiver and i am acutely aware of her sacrifices			0
parkinson 's disease affects more than just the patient			0
the patient needs to understand the caregiver is there to help			0
so do not let parkinson 's disease control your life			0
you may do things slower , or you may not be able to do things you once did as easily			0
it is not the end of the world			0
do not give up trying			0
