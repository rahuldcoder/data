they had been in @entity1 for a week trying to reach @entity2 , 17,769 feet above sea level , when they were caught in a snowstorm , unable to make it to the nearest village			2
avalanches roared down the mountain			2
@entity10 and his girlfriend @entity11 pressed on : extreme hiking enthusiasts , they had committed to making it all the way through			1
for some people , the idea of facing such obstacles -- especially voluntarily -- seems crazy			1
and yet many in the extreme hiking community would n't have it any other way			1
the new film " @entity26 , " based on the memoir by @entity25 , chronicles a grueling solo hike along 1,100 miles of the @entity28 , on the border with @entity30 , after @entity25 's divorce and the death of her mother			2

" we had to break into an abandoned cabin just before dark to spend the night with our guide and another trekking group			0
" the payoff came the next day when the couple reached the tiny village of @entity54 , surrounded by @entity56 peaks			0
" it was one of the most beautiful places i 've ever had the chance to see , " he said			0
and that , in a nutshell , is why @entity41 hikes			0

" i like the idea of never really knowing what to expect around the next corner			1
" @entity71 , a 27 - year - old software engineer from @entity72 , @entity73 , got a similar feeling about hiking when he visited @entity75 a year ago in his most memorable of many hikes			0
he had half a mind to quit midway through his hike through the @entity80 volcano due to the incredibly steep terrain , but the hikers with him motivated him to continue to the top			1
ultimately , he said it was the best hiking excursion he has done			0
he was able to admire views of three other nearby volcanoes : @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 , making the whole experience -- three hours on foot -- well worth it			2
