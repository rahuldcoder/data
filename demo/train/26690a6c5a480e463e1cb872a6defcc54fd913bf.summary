-- search teams looking for @entity3 are investigating a number of sounds detected by ships in the southern @entity7 , authorities said sunday , but it 's not yet clear if any of them are from the missing plane 's so - called black box			1
a @entity12 vessel is on its way to an area where a @entity16 ship reported picking up electronic signals twice , once on friday and again on saturday , said @entity18 , the head of the @entity20 agency coordinating search operations			1
and the @entity20 naval ship @entity22 , which has highly sophisticated equipment , is pursuing " an acoustic noise " that it detected in a different area , @entity18 said at a news conference			1
he said the detections were " an important and encouraging lead , " but he cautioned that they be treated " carefully " as they have n't been verified as being related to flight 370			1
fevered search searchers are desperately seeking any clue about the location of the airliner that disappeared nearly a month ago with 239 people on board			1
up to 10 military planes , two civil aircraft and 13 ships will assist in sunday 's search for the airline			1
the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) plans to search three separate areas sunday about 2,000 kilometers ( about 1,240 miles ) northwest of @entity46			1
that area totals about 216,000 square kilometers ( 83,000 square miles )			0
@entity20 planes are being deployed to the area where the @entity16 ship , @entity50 01 , picked up signals that would be consistent with those emitted by an aircraft 's flight recorders , said @entity18 , the chief coordinator of @entity20 's @entity55			1
a number of white objects were sighted about 56 miles ( 90 kilometers ) away from where the sound was detected , he said			0
but he stressed that were was so far no confirmation that the signals and objects are related to flight 370			0
" in the days , weeks and possibly months ahead , there may be leads such as the one i 'm reporting to you this morning on a regular basis , " @entity18 , a retired air chief marshal , said			0
handheld hydrophone video on @entity16 state - run @entity71 shot saturday shows crew members from the @entity50 01 boarding a small yellow dinghy and using what appears to be a handheld hydrophone			1
the three men on board lower the device into the water on a pole			0
the handheld ping - locating technology used by the @entity16 ship is not as versatile as a @entity84 towed locator , which goes as deep as 20,000 feet , far from surface noise , according to experts			1
the @entity84 hydrophone -- or underwater microphone , is on board the @entity20 ship @entity22 , which recently joined the search for @entity3			1
the state - run @entity16 news agency , @entity93 , said a detector deployed by the @entity97 patrol ship picked up the signal around 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude			1
that puts it about 1,020 miles ( 1,640 kilometers ) west - northwest of @entity46 , @entity20 , between current and previous search zones , and about 220 miles ( 354 kilometers ) south of the closest of the three areas searched saturday , said @entity105 , a meteorologist with @entity106			1
@entity18 said sunday that the sounds were detected " in the high probability area			1
" white objects spotted also found saturday -- spotted by a @entity16 air force search plane -- were white objects floating near the search area			1
investigators have failed to link any of the many previous sightings of debris to the missing plane			0
but the proximity of the two finds raised hopes that this time might be different			0
the ship first detected a signal friday but could n't record it because the signal stopped abruptly , a @entity123 - based @entity122 newspaper said			1
the signal detected saturday , the @entity128 said , occurred at 3:57 p.m. @entity129 time ( 3:57 a.m. et ) and lasted about a minute and a half			1
it was not clear whether the signal had anything to do with the missing plane			2
a @entity71 correspondent aboard the @entity97 ( pronounced " high shuen " ) reported that the 37.5 khz signal was detected for a minute and a half			2
@entity140 acoustic @entity18 confirmed the two separate detections and said they showed " some promise			2
" but the signals picked up by the @entity16 searchers were " fleeting acoustic events , " he said			1
" it 's not a continuous transmission			2
if you get close to the device , we should be receiving it for a longer period of time			0
" the signal " is the standard beacon frequency " for the plane 's cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder , said @entity155 , president of pinger manufacturer @entity156			1
" the frequency was chosen for use in the recorders " to give that standout quality that does not get interfered with by the background noise that readily occurs in the ocean			0
" but he said he would like to see more evidence			0
" i 'd like to see some additional assets on site quickly -- maybe some sonobuoys , " he said , referring to 5 - inch - long sonar systems that are dropped from aircraft or ships			1
and he said he was puzzled that only one signal had been detected , since each of the recorders was equipped with a pinger , which is also called a beacon			2
no confirmation other experts cautioned that no confirmation had been made that the signal was linked to the missing plane			2
" it ought to be easy to rule it in or rule it out , and they ought to go do it , " said @entity188 , a @entity0 aviation analyst and a former inspector general for the @entity191 @entity190			0
saturday 's leads came as concern was rising that the batteries powering the missing @entity201 's locator pingers would soon go dead			2
the plane disappeared on march 8 ; its batteries were guaranteed to work for 30 days underwater , and are predicted to die slowly over the following days			0
the batteries on flight 370 's black boxes were due to be replaced in june , the @entity205 chief executive said saturday			2
" we can confirm there is a maintenance program			0
batteries are replaced prior to expiration , " @entity212 said			0
relative reacts the tentative nature of the first report of an acoustic signal was not lost on one @entity16 relative of one of those aboard			1
" there is not confirmation , and we are all waiting patiently , " the relative told @entity0 producer @entity222 in a text message			0
still , @entity228 's acting transport minister , @entity227 , was sanguine : " another night of hope - praying hard , " he tweeted in response to the initial detection			2
" we 've had a lot of red herrings , hyperbole on this whole search , " said oceanographer @entity231 , a lecturer in ocean and earth science at the @entity234			2
" i 'd really like to see this data confirmed			0
" if this proves to be what investigators have been searching for , " then the possibility of recovering the plane -- or at least the black boxes -- goes from being one in a million to almost certain , " he said			0
but , he added , " it could be a false signal			0
" @entity0 aviation analyst @entity247 was less skeptical			0
" this is a pinger , " the airplane accident investigator said			0
" i 've been doing this a lot of years , and i ca n't think of anything else it could be			0
" @entity0 's @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity263 and @entity264 contributed to this report .			0
