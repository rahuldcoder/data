-- we are about to mark the 12th anniversary of 9/11			2
since then , @entity3 and its affiliated groups have n't launched a successful attack in the @entity6			1
the @entity8 bombings in april , however , serve as a reminder that the @entity6 still faces a terrorism threat from disaffected @entity6 citizens and residents who are influenced by @entity3 's ideology			1
so what is the status of this kind of threat ? the good news is that the number of " homegrown " jihadist extremists who have been indicted or convicted has steadily declined over the past few years , according to @entity23 data			1
where there were 41 cases in 2009 , there have been six so far this year			0
the number of individuals indicted for plotting actual attacks within the @entity6 -- as opposed to other terrorism - related crimes such as raising money for a terrorist group -- also declined from 12 in 2011 to only three so far in 2013			1
in recent years , extremists plotting attacks against the @entity6 have also shown little , if any , connection to foreign groups			1
none of the 21 homegrown extremists involved in plots against the @entity6 from 2011 to so far in 2013 is known to have received training abroad			1
of these extremists , only one , @entity42 , one of the alleged @entity44 bombers , is reported to have had contact with foreign militant operatives , but it remains unclear to what extent , if any , those contacts played a role in the @entity44 attack			1
this lack of coordination between domestic extremists and overseas groups is likely the result of two factors			2
first , the ability of terrorist organizations to coordinate with extremists in the @entity6 has been reduced by policing efforts inside the country and counterterrorism operations abroad			2
second , internet use among jihadist extremists enables them to come into contact with extremist communities abroad and be radicalized without face - to - face meetings			0
of the 45 " homegrown " jihadist extremists who were indicted , convicted or killed from 2011 to now , 18 are known to have communicated with other extremists over the @entity72 or posted materials related to their radicalization online			2
the shift to plotting by individuals who lack ties to foreign groups poses a distinct type of threat -- plots and attacks that are more difficult to detect but are also likely to be of a smaller scale			2
and because of the measures now in place to prevent the acquisition of precursor chemicals and materials suitable for making conventional explosives , homegrown extremists have also often struggled to produce effective bombs			1
before the @entity8 bombings , homegrown jihadists in the @entity6 had shown little success at producing explosives			1
@entity96 -- who has professed admiration for @entity98 and @entity100 bomber @entity99 -- almost killed himself in april 2010 when a homemade bomb he was constructing exploded prematurely			0
a month later , @entity103 's car bomb failed to explode in @entity104 , even though he had received explosives training in @entity106			0
if the @entity42 brothers built the bombs used in the @entity44 attack without guidance from jihadists abroad , it suggests that the difficulties other " homegrown " militants have had building or detonating explosives may have been overcome			1
on the other hand , the @entity118 ' successful bombmaking could just as easily have been a fluke			0
while the number of terrorism - related indictments fell between 2009 and 2013 , the number of terrorist incidents has stayed about the same -- about one per year -- though not all of them have been lethal : -- in june 2009 , @entity127 killed a soldier outside a recruiting station in @entity130 , @entity131			0
-- five months later , @entity132 shot and killed 13 people at @entity134 in @entity135 , @entity136			0
-- @entity103 's 2010 attempt to bomb @entity104 was foiled when his bomb did not ignite properly			0
-- @entity140 's drive - by shooting of military facilities in @entity141 in 2011 produced no casualties			0
-- the @entity8 bombers killed four and wounded hundreds of others in april 2013			0
the incidents carried out by homegrown extremists continue to be limited in their lethality , and major operations such as the 9/11 attacks are well beyond the skills of even the most capable domestic extremists			1
additionally , no homegrown jihadist militant in the @entity6 is known to have acquired or used chemical , biological , radiological or nuclear ( @entity156 ) weapons in the past twelve years			2
this point bears repeating , as there has been considerable overheated commentary on this subject over the past decade			0
of the 221 individual cases of jihadist extremism since 9/11 , not one case involved an allegation of @entity156 acquisition , manufacture or use			0
however , the fact that jihadist extremists in the @entity6 have shown no interest in @entity156 weapons does not eliminate the need for securing potential sources of chemical , biological and radiological agents			2
according to a count by the @entity23 , since 2001 , 13 extremists motivated by right - wing ideologies , one left - wing militant and two individuals with idiosyncratic motives have deployed , acquired or tried to acquire chemical , biological or radiological weapons			0
for example , @entity183 and @entity184 , two anti-government extremists , possessed precursor chemicals for hydrogen cyanide gas , which they discussed deploying through a building 's ventilation system			0
they were arrested in 2003 and later pleaded guilty			0
the threat from homegrown extremists to the @entity6 homeland has been constrained in recent years by a variety of security measures			1
according to data collected by the @entity23 , family members of extremists and members of the wider @entity200 provided useful information in the investigations of about a third of the homegrown jihadist extremists indicted or killed since 9/11			2
@entity207 members provided useful reports of suspicious activity in another 9 % of homegrown extremist cases , while an informant or undercover agent monitored almost half of all homegrown extremists			1
the @entity214 , however , demonstrate the potential for these security measures to fail when plotters have few , if any connections , to known terrorist groups			0
looking forward , a concern about the @entity44 attack is whether it represents an intelligence failure that could have been avoided through a better implementation of existing policies or a new trend where " lone wolf " extremism is largely undetectable with the existing systemic checks in place			1
the threat from homegrown extremists has changed substantially in the past three years , becoming the province of fewer individuals who are less connected to foreign groups than was once the case			1
whether this remains the case will depend on law enforcement being able to successfully adapt to confront the threat from disaffected @entity6 - based individuals motivated by @entity3 's ideology as well as whether the past few years ' counterterrorism successes against @entity3 overseas can be maintained .			1

authors : since 9/11 , @entity3 has n't carried out a successful attack in the @entity6
they say the threat has evolved into a danger of homegrown extremists launching attacks
study finds that the number of attempted attacks has been declining
authors : could the @entity44 bombings have been prevented through better intelligence ?
