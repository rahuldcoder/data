-- " yes , but what was the best film for grown - ups ? " a friend asked me when i told him " @entity6 " was my favorite movie of the year			1
that took the wind out of my sails			1
of course he had n't seen " @entity6 , " which is absolutely a film for sensitive , alert , thinking - audiences of all ages			1
the movie is very much concerned with art , mortality and the passage of time , which some might consider mature and adult themes			1
but in a more general sense , he had a point			2
the movies -- and especially @entity24 movies -- have been so thoroughly infantilized over the years that even the @entity25 can overlook the few truly grown - up movies out there -- " @entity28 , " " @entity29 , " " @entity30 , " " @entity31 " and " @entity32 " -- to nominate " @entity33 " as the film of the year			1
do n't get me wrong			2
i enjoyed this charming , anodyne , affectionate pastiche , not least because it reminded me of many , far better movies such as " @entity38 , " " @entity39 " and bits and pieces by @entity42 and @entity43			1
but even though it 's calculated to appeal to a middle - class crowd , this is essentially bland , sentimental entertainment			2
it does n't challenge the audience , ask questions or provoke			2
it does n't stir the emotions , break new ground or grapple with the pressing issues of our time			2
does " @entity6 " ? i think so			1
like " @entity33 , " " @entity6 " resurrects a bygone era of cinema			1
in this case , @entity60 @entity59 , a pioneer in the techniques of special effects , jump cuts and superimposes live action and animation in a kind of proto - @entity69			2
in evoking this pioneer , veteran director @entity70 means us to reflect on how quickly fame and fortune pass by and on what is important about the past			1
no coincidence that " @entity6 " was made in @entity76 -- and beautifully , i might add			1
this was a tectonic year in the movie industry -- the year that 35mm was all but phased out of the exhibition sector in favor of digital projection			2
the shift does not come at the instigation of filmmakers or the audience , but rather to cut the costs of distribution			1
nevertheless it will have considerable effect on the way movies are made , how they look and how they are consumed			1
in this brave new multiplex world , @entity76 is not the only story , but it is a major part of it , and a generation of children are growing up watching stereoscopic animated features and family blockbusters			1
will these kids look back on 2 - @entity102 , " flat " movies with the same disinterest the preceding generation feels for anything in black and white ? i do n't know , but i suspect that 's why we 've seen such heavyweight filmmakers as @entity70 , @entity109 ( " @entity110 " ) , @entity111 ( " @entity113 " ) and @entity112 ( " @entity114 " ) embracing @entity76 this year			1
and what 's more , each of them makes a compelling case for the new form in the very different ways they explore movement			2
" @entity6 " @entity123 turns back the clock to celebrate the genesis of cinema even as he fashions perhaps the most beautiful 3 - d movie yet			1
" @entity28 " @entity130 's second film took six years to find even a token release , but it 's a masterpiece			1
@entity132 is outstanding in this teeming , devastating movie about connection			0
" @entity29 " there is no sharper comic filmmaker than @entity138 , and this poignant @entity140 family story is astute and perfectly turned			0
" @entity141 " a commuter train trip becomes a kind of purgatory for @entity145 , with each journey ending in death			0
easily the smartest sci - fi movie of the year			0
" drive " pure pop bliss , this chic retro thriller cast @entity152 as an icon of machismo cool and rediscovered the latent noir malignancy in @entity156			0
" @entity157 " only @entity158 would dream of destroying the planet without ever leaving the grounds of a country house -- and get away with it			0
it 's an excessive , frustrating but formidable movie with a remarkable performance by @entity165			0
" @entity166 " there were several stunning documentaries this year -- i strongly recommend " @entity171 , " " @entity172 " and " tabloid , " for starters			0
but this @entity175 nonfiction essay is something apart , a scintillating rumination on humanity and the cosmos			0
" @entity180 " @entity181 and @entity182 are the bedrock , blue - collar @entity184 whose life is torn apart by his visions of a biblical storm on the horizon			0
" poetry " this @entity192 film about a grandmother looking for grace in the midst of a sea of trouble is one of those slow - burners that stays with you			0
" bridesmaids " probably the most fun you could have at the movies this year			1
@entity205 's raucous anti-chick flick was lewd and crude but a laugh riot			0
" @entity208 " @entity209 strikes again			0
this inane video game wannabe fetishizes feminism for cheap thrills to deeply dull effect			0
" @entity215 " this misconceived , terminally cute " prestige picture " asks all the wrong questions about 9/11 and exploits that tragedy to jerk out easy tears			0
" @entity220 " should have been fun			0
" your highness " in which several talented people ( including @entity225 , @entity226 and director @entity227 ) aim low and wind up looking silly			0
" @entity229 " in which @entity231 's convincing portrait of a middle - age breakdown is undermined by an incoherent script and @entity236 's hackneyed direction .			0

movies have been thoroughly infantilized over the years , @entity238 says
charity : like " @entity33 , " " @entity6 " resurrects a bygone era of cinema
heavyweight filmmakers such as @entity70 , @entity109 embrace @entity76
