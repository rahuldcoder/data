-- imagine you are welded to the sofa at home about to watch a third match in a row			2
you have been drinking throughout the day , but reach for another can of cold beer and fill your glass			2
but the vessel you are drinking from says that your alcohol intake has exceeded safe levels and urges you to reconsider			1
rather than a desperate government intervention , this is the concept of the @entity15 ' smart cup ' -- a groundbreaking addition to the field of consumer health technologies , which has launched for pre-orders			1
the sleek 13 - ounce design is fitted with a sensor that analyzes the molecular content of drinks in real time , and then displays selected nutritional information such as sugar or alcohol content on the side of the cup			1
in a live demonstration for @entity0 , inventor and ceo of parent company @entity35 , @entity31 used the @entity15 to identify a range of beverages			1
the cup -- synced to his iphone -- took only a few seconds to recognize a specific brand of smoothie , and was able to discern an exact flavor of @entity44			0
moments later , sugar and calorie content flash up			1
users can adapt the device to their personal needs , says @entity31			1
" we want this to be a product for what matters to you			0
people who want to lose weight will care most about the calories			1
i work out so i 'm more interested in protein			0
people can also be mindful of caffeine consumption -- to be sharp but not jittery			0
" the device can be set to multiple " lenses " to meet a variety of needs , from weight loss to improved sleep			1
it tracks cumulative consumption so that users can observe and improve their patterns			0
@entity31 hopes that @entity71 will be used in conjunction with existing health technologies that record personal details such as heart rate and body mass index to optimize consumption choices			0
the mobile app includes a feature for a tailored hydration program based on such personal details			0
there is a medical imperative behind the @entity15			1
" sugar - sweetened beverages are the number one source of calories " , reported a recent survey from the @entity85			0
soft drinks are increasingly identified by health organizations as a leading cause of obesity , with major efforts to restrict their consumption and improve public understanding of the high sugar levels			2
other products are beginning to offer forms of molecular analysis for our food , but @entity103 believes that usability will prove a trump card			2
" we wanted this to be as easy as possible for consumers , we were completely focused on making the interaction simple			0
the data has to be clear and actionable			0
" certainly , one need not be a technology guru to make use of the @entity15 , the ease of which owes much to the collaboration with award - winning designer @entity115 , creator of the @entity116			1
the only action required of the user is to tilt the cup and read the numbers displayed on the side of the cup			2
the only maintenance required is " quick rinse " between drinks , and charging is delivered via a wireless coaster			2
the size and shape is conventional with a " flick - to - open " spill - proof lid			0
the @entity15 has heavyweight support , with leading innovators at @entity133 and @entity134 among its admirers			1
" people will at first be blown away , and then they are going to expect everything else in the world to be able to see its contents and materials the same way " , says @entity136 , head of mobile at @entity138			0
while some may still prefer not to know the gory details of everything they consume , innovations like the @entity15 are making it harder than ever to live in ignorance			1
