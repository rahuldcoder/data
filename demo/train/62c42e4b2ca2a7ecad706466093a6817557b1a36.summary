@entity0 , @entity1 -- rebel fighters say they are in control of most of @entity1 's capital , though the months - long war appeared far from over saturday			1
as rebels worked to extend their reach , @entity8 's forces battled back from a number of loyalist strongholds in @entity1			1
the fighting followed warnings by the @entity15 and its diplomatic partners that widespread shortages of food , water , fuel and medical supplies could further destabilize the region			1
" all agreed that the crisis in @entity1 has entered a new and decisive phase , " @entity15 @entity23 ban ki - moon said , following conversations friday with the heads of the @entity26 , the @entity27 and others			1
" @entity32 agreed , as well , on the importance of a smooth transition			0
" @entity23 said the transition from @entity8 's rule must be based on inclusiveness , reconciliation and national unity			1
" all agreed that , if the @entity1 authorities request , we should be prepared to help develop police capacity , bearing in mind that the country is awash with small arms , " @entity23 said			2
the rebel 's leadership , the @entity48 , has called on the @entity49 to order the release of billions of dollars frozen by the @entity51 and others at the onset of the war			2
though the @entity48 has been recognized by 57 countries and the @entity15 as the legitimate representative of the @entity1 people , the @entity26 failed to follow suit during a meeting friday			1

the @entity26 's @entity67 issued a communiqu√© that urged the " formation of an inclusive transitional government			2
" @entity8 , who served as chairman of the organization in 2009 , has strong ties to some of its members , including @entity77 and @entity78			2

the transitional council has placed a $ 1.4 million bounty on @entity8 's head to whoever brings him in or kills him			1
" right now , as i 've been saying the past few days , right now there is no evidence to indicate that @entity8 has left @entity1 , " @entity91 , president @entity92 's principal deputy press secretary , told reporters friday			1
it is unclear who is directing @entity8 's forces , who have been battling back at a number of loyalist strongholds			1
in @entity8 's hometown of @entity107 , @entity105 warplanes bombed a headquarters bunker , the @entity103 @entity102 said			1
tornado aircraft fired a salvo of precision - guided missiles into the city , which is east of the @entity1 capital on the central coast , it said			2
clashes also were reported along @entity1 's western border , where rebels took control of the main border crossing between the two countries , according to @entity123 state - run media			2
in the heart of the capital , rebels began exploring a vast network of tunnels that run underneath @entity8 's @entity129 -- the scene of heavy fighting in recent days			1
inside the tunnels , rebels discovered a golf cart believed to be used to navigate the thick - walled hallways , which they believe lead from the compound to the fiercely contested airport , said @entity2 's @entity139 , who joined the rebels to explore the underground network			0
a former @entity51 airbase converted by @entity8 into a military airport also was opened up by the rebels in @entity0 , revealing long lines of helicopters and dust - laden jets once worth millions of dollars apiece rusting on the tarmac			1
rebels tore down a statue at the airport of a fist clenching a fighter jet , which was erected by @entity8 after @entity51 fighters struck the leader 's @entity0 compound in retaliation for sponsoring terrorism strikes against @entity51 citizens			1

at that point , " i 'm going to see my mother			0
i 'm going to see my family , " said @entity171			0
" i 'm going to remove this gun from my hands			0
it 's not for me			0
" the war 's toll was evident at one @entity0 hospital where dozens of bodies lay abandoned , said @entity2 's @entity180 , who toured the hospital with rebels			2
one man was overwhelmed with joy to discover his son among the wounded inside the hospital			0
but his joy was tempered by the fact that the son 's wound -- a bullet to the chest -- could still prove fatal , @entity180 said			0
the continued fighting came amid mounting evidence of revenge killings by rebels and loyalists			0
@entity199 said friday it had gathered accounts from survivors of abuse in @entity203 by @entity205 soldiers and rebel forces			0
@entity199 said it also uncovered evidence that @entity205 forces killed detainees at two military camps in @entity0 on tuesday and wednesday			0
escaped detainees said loyalist forces had used grenades and gunfire on scores of prisoners at one camp , while guards at the other camp fatally shot five detainees			0
" loyalist forces in @entity1 must immediately stop such killings of captives , and both sides must commit to ensuring no harm comes to prisoners in their custody , " @entity199 said			0
the @entity228 has issued an arrest warrant for @entity8 alleging crimes against humanity			0
meanwhile , the @entity232 warned antiquities dealers and others to be on the look out for @entity1 artifacts that may be looted during the unrest			1
" experience shows that there is a serious danger of destruction during times of social upheaval , " @entity243 , @entity232 's director - general , said			2
" careless dealers who buy these objects and fragments are in fact inciting more looting			0

" @entity2 's @entity180 , @entity255 , @entity139 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 and @entity259 contributed to this report .			0
