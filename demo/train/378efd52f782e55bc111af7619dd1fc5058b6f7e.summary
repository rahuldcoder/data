-- following the preliminary hearing of a @entity4 father accused of allowing his child to die in a hot car , most legal experts agree that the prosecution will likely upgrade the charges to malice murder after the case is presented to a grand jury			1
for now , until those charges are upgraded , @entity12 is charged with felony murder , perhaps the most widely criticized legal construct in @entity16 jurisprudence			1
to many legal scholars , the felony murder rule is logically and morally indefensible			1
to many members of the law - and - order public , the ends of the felony murder rule justify the means			1
and in @entity4 it is liberally employed			0
it offers an end run around the very difficult standard of proof to find a killing was intentional			0
first , let 's define murder			0
most @entity16 have a working definition of murder , formed not only by what they 've gleaned about the law , but also their personal morality			0
murder is generally understood to be an intentional killing , without justification			2
there are subcategories of intentional murder : for example , killing by poison , torture , or ambush are considered worse ; these show intent and take a more prolonged period			2
in addition to intentional killings , those resulting from incredibly reckless behavior qualify for murder , too			2
it makes sense : if someone shoots a gun into a crowd of people , someone is highly likely to die -- even though the defendant could truthfully say he did n't actually aim for the victim			0
it 's important to remember that this kind of murder is not defined simply by the stupidity of the actions -- the defendant must have been aware of the risk , and have acted with a depraved indifference to human life			0
these are two main kinds of murder			0
one is intentional , and the other involves behavior so indifferent to human life and so close to intentional that it might as well have been			2
but then there 's felony murder			1
call it what you will , but the " felony murder rule " is murder in name only			1
in fact , it 's a first - degree murder charge for an admittedly unintentional killing			2
more specifically , it 's a killing that happens during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony			2
with this definition , the policy behind the felony murder rule becomes immediately apparent : deterrence			1
the rule sends a powerful message to would - be felons : burglary , arson , rape , robbery , and kidnapping are so dangerous that a defendant should know that an innocent person is likely to die			0
if you intend to rob a bank , then you know a bank teller might die			0
therefore , you , too , should be charged with murder , along with that robbery -- even if you were driving the getaway car and not the one who pulled the trigger			2
to felony murder supporters , it does n't matter that a defendant is charged with murder , even a defendant they know did n't actually kill anyone and who did n't want anyone to die			1
to them , the ends of the felony murder rule justify the means : if you do n't want to catch a murder case , do n't rob banks			2
it 's the cases like @entity12 that really test the morality of the rule , while exposing some logical problems with its application			0
@entity4 has a very broad felony murder statute : the only limitation on the type of underlying felony for a felony murder conviction is that the crime must be " inherently dangerous to human life			1
" also in @entity4 , a conviction for felony murder may be predicated on second degree child cruelty , which qualifies as that " inherently dangerous felony			1
" that 's what has happened so far in this case			0
the prosecution has charged @entity12 with second degree child cruelty , and used that charge as the predicate felony for the murder charge			1
there 's just one problem : the second degree cruelty charge is a negligence crime			0
that means @entity12 is charged with murder using a felony charge that is an unintentional crime			1
in other words , @entity4 reserves the charge of murder for the most intentional , depraved conduct , but if you do something unintentional but negligent , that can be a qualifying felony			2
so , charging @entity12 with felony murder predicated on child neglect was a brilliant strategic move by the prosecutors			1
proving a specific intent to kill in this case will be more difficult than proving mere carelessness in parenting			0
and if both are murder , then there 's no reason to charge the more difficult crime to prove			0
key role of digital evidence of course , at the preliminary hearing , you 'd never know that the charge was negligence , because we heard ample evidence of malicious intent			0
the defense attorney made a reasoned argument that the prosecution 's state - of - mind evidence was thinly disguised , improper character evidence , but the judge sided with the prosecution and allowed this damning evidence in against @entity12			0
the sexting , the life insurance policy , the internet searches , had nothing to do with @entity12 ' alleged negligence -- remember , right now , negligence is the only basis of the felony murder charge			1
it 's as if the prosecution put on a hearing for a specific intent crime , malice murder , that has n't been charged yet			1
that 's why the preliminary hearing was just a harbinger of things to come			0
why put on evidence of so much malice if it was n't really germane to a charge of neglect ? because we 'll probably see upgraded charges in the near future , once this case goes to a grand jury			0
it 's very likely that the felony murder charges will only be a short chapter in the prosecution of @entity12			1
however , they present an opportunity to open a debate traditionally reserved for legal scholars and philosophers : is felony murder an unfair legal fiction that overly punishes people for unintentional killings ? or , is the overall message to would - be felons worth ignoring the logical inconsistencies of the felony murder rule ? in law , as in many things , legal minds can differ on whether the ends justify the means .			1

@entity254 : @entity12 charged with felony murder , a *controversial* charge
usually murder is intentional or behavior so dangerous it might have been intended
@entity254 : but felony murder is when someone is killed during a felony , which child abuse is
@entity254 : legal experts think the real charge will be malice murder , or murder with intent
