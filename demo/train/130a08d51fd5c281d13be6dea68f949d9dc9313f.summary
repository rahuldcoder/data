-- @entity1 is stepping down from the @entity3 throne after nearly 40 years , handing power to his son after a series of scandals that has dented the royal family 's popularity			1
the @entity1 said crown prince @entity10 , a former @entity11 yachtsman , has " the maturity , the preparation , and the sense of responsibility necessary " to serve as king and " to lead to a new stage of hope using his experience and the drive of a new generation			1
" prince @entity10 , 46 , is regarded as being untouched by the accusations of corruption and excess that have plagued the royal family as many @entity3 continue to struggle to find jobs and pull themselves out of financial ruin			1
princess @entity29 , the @entity10 's older sister , is embroiled in a tax fraud and money laundering investigation			0
she and her husband , @entity32 , have denied allegations that they diverted public funds from @entity36 's foundation for private use			0
@entity3 have long held @entity1 , 76 , in high regard for shepherding the country into democracy following the death of dictator @entity42 in 1975			2
but his popularity took a hit in 2012 over a controversial elephant - hunting trip to @entity46 while the nation was mired in a deep economic crisis			0
prince @entity10 , the third child and only son of @entity1 and @entity50 , has been preparing to be king his entire life			2
he attended his father 's coronation before parliament in 1975 , and reportedly stayed awake late into the night to witness what is considered to be the @entity1 's finest moment -- his decisive put - down of an attempted coup by a section of the military in february 1981			1
@entity10 studied international relations at @entity63 in the @entity64 and trained as a @entity3 military officer			1
he was also a member of @entity3 's @entity11 yachting team at the @entity68 games in 1992			1
the @entity10 has increasingly stood in for the @entity1 at a variety of official engagements in recent years as his father 's health has faltered			1
@entity10 also presides over the annual @entity73 , prestigious accolades presented by his foundation for achievements in the fields of science , the humanities , and sports			0
in 2004 @entity10 married @entity81 , a famous former tv anchor who worked for @entity82 , @entity3 's state - run @entity83 , and @entity0 + , a @entity3 @entity0 station that is no longer on the air			1
the @entity10 's marriage to @entity81 , a divorced commoner who left her own career behind to join the royal family , has made the monarchy seem more modern and accessible to ordinary @entity3			1
@entity81 is " someone who has travelled on the subway , taken out a mortgage to buy an apartment in a @entity95 suburb , and brought emotional baggage to the relationship , " according to @entity98 at @entity99			0
the couple have tried to create a normal living environment for their family , according to @entity99 , regularly taking their two young daughters to school and putting them to bed at night themselves			0
and despite his family 's recent troubles , @entity10 remains a very popular figure in @entity3			2
two - thirds of @entity3 see the @entity10 in a favorable light , according to a survey by @entity114 in december			2
the @entity1 's approval rating in the same poll was just 41.3 %			2
@entity10 's biggest task , in light of the recent scandals , will be to make the royal palace more transparent			2
his family has a relatively austere reputation when compared with other @entity124 monarchies , but there has been increasing resentment in @entity3 over the cost of the royal family to the public			0
the crown 's budget -- more than â ‚ ¬ 7.78 million ( $ 10.5m ) in 2014 -- has been cut nearly 13 % over the past five years , and the monarchy has begun publishing yearly breakdowns of its annual spending in an attempt to curb criticism , according to the @entity138 's @entity137			0
the overtures , however , have done little to silence a vocal minority in @entity3 who want to see the crown abolished altogether			0
after @entity1 ' announcement monday , thousands poured into the streets to call for a nationwide referendum on the future of the monarchy			0
lawmakers have largely ignored those calls , and the soon - to - be - named @entity150 is expected to be sworn in as king sometime after june 18 at a ceremony in front of @entity3 's @entity154			1
