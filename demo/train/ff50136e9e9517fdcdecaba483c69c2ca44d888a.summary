-- @entity1 reopened monday after municipal employees worked to clean up damage they said was caused over the weekend by occupy protesters , about 400 of whom were arrested following clashes with police in the @entity8 city			1
@entity9 was one such worker , called in over the weekend to help scrub graffiti and vacuum floors , @entity0 affiliate @entity12 reported			2
" this is not protesting			0
when you protest , you protest			0
this is madness here , " @entity9 said			0
the mass arrests , described by police as the largest in city history , appear to have injected new life into the @entity21 as protesters in a number of @entity25 and @entity26 cities took to the streets sunday to express their solidarity with the @entity31 group			1
" the occupy movement will respond , as we have always responded : with an overwhelming show of collective resistance , " @entity34 said in a statement posted on its website			0
windows broken , flags burned in @entity1 @entity31 is part of a larger movement that began last year on @entity43 's @entity42 and quickly spread across the globe			1
while the protesters have highlighted a number of causes , the overarching theme remained the same : populist anger over what activists portray as an out - of - touch corporate , financial and political elite			2
from @entity55 to @entity56 , @entity57 , there were reports of occupy protesters taking to the streets in mostly non-violent demonstrations			1
twelve people were arrested in @entity43 during an @entity34 protest that saw the group march from @entity66 to @entity67 , police said			1
charges and details about the arrests were not immediately made available			2
in @entity73 , @entity74 , several protesters were arrested for blocking traffic , @entity0 affiliate @entity71 reported			1
in @entity55 , police reported several hundred protesters blocked traffic near @entity1 and attempted to cut down a fence near an area park where occupy protesters were recently evicted from camping out			1
two protesters were arrested , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity83			2
overseas , occupy protests were held outside @entity25 consulates in @entity86 and @entity87 , while statements of solidarity were issued by occupy groups in @entity91 , @entity92 , and in @entity93 , @entity94 , according to @entity96 and website posts late sunday			0
much of the news stemming from the @entity21 in recent weeks has focused on government efforts to relocate the protest groups , many of whom had taken up residence in city parks and plazas			2
in @entity106 , the @entity105 gave occupy protesters a deadline to end what it called " sleeping activity " at two longstanding camps established by demonstrators in the nation 's capital			0
@entity25 @entity114 began enforcing the ban monday , with occupy protesters at one site defiantly huddling under a large blue tarp that they dubbed the " tent of dreams			0
" park service to crack down on @entity123 camps park police used a stun gun to apprehend one demonstrator , who tore down park service notices warning protesters of the monday deadline			1
but none of the weekend activities rose to the level of violence witnessed in @entity134 , where protesters on saturday clashed with police after they were prevented from taking over a long - vacant auditorium in the heart of downtown			1
protesters and police traded allegations over who was to blame for the violence that saw demonstrators throw rocks and bottles at police , who it turn fired bean bag rounds , tear gas and smoke grenades at the group			2
@entity134 police officer @entity153 described what transpired as " one of the largest mass arrests that we have seen in the city			1
" the charges ranged from failure to disperse to vandalism , @entity153 said			0
the city of about 420,000 , located across the bay from @entity164 , has a long and sometimes violent history of activism dating back to the mid- 1960s with the founding of the militant @entity168 and later for its anti-war protests			2
@entity134 has been a flash point of the occupy movement since october , when police used tear gas to break up demonstrators who refused to leave downtown			1
one demonstrator , an @entity177 war veteran , suffered a skull fracture after being hit with a police projectile , according to a veteran 's group			0
police said they acted after the crowd threw paint and other objects at officers			0
in november , violence broke out again in @entity134 when police shuttered an @entity21 camp at an area park			1
twice , protesters have forced the shut down of the @entity191			0
but saturday marked a new chapter in the @entity21 movement when the group attempted to take over the long - vacant @entity195 to use as a hub			0
the group said it was necessary , in part because " since november , the city of @entity134 and its police force have made it impossible for us to meet , to serve food and to provide a place for people to stay			1
" the effort turned violent when police turned the group back , alleging the protesters were damaging construction equipment and fences near the convention center			2
by nightfall , the protesters stormed a @entity215 and later broke into @entity1 , police and city officials said			1
protesters have decried the allegations , saying they entered the buildings through open doors			0
but mayor @entity222 told reporters that police have video showing protesters using a crowbar , or something similar to it , to pry open an emergency door to enter @entity1			1
@entity222 took reporters through @entity1 on sunday , pointing to walls where graffiti had already been painted over and other areas of garbage , vandalism and destruction that she said had been left by protesters			1
the mayor said there were no firm estimates as to how much damage had been caused , noting that workers had already painted over some " obscene " graffiti and that clean - up efforts would continue			0
meanwhile , @entity31 put out a call for financial aid to help some of those arrested make bail			0
" our bail funds have been dwindling significantly as a result of the police backlash against occupy @entity134 in the last month			2
if you are able , please donate , " the group said			0
