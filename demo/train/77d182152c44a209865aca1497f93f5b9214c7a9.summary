-- @entity1 may be the most vivacious and personable light comic actress in the movies right now			0
she has something of @entity5 's instinct to take a tired scene and give it a good kick in the pants			0
and @entity11 's forlorn and directionless @entity10 in " @entity12 " could use it , too			1
@entity11 is the anti-matter to @entity1 's shooting star : doughy ( well , he is playing a sous chef here ) , oversized and doleful , he 's one of those actors who has learned to capitalize on his flaws , exposing his inadequacies as often as possible to lugubrious comic effect			1
we 've all seen lopsided couples like this , but the central flaw in " @entity12 " ( which @entity11 also co-wrote with his regular collaborator , director @entity27 ) is that despite their regular protestations of love , for most of the movie , @entity11 's @entity10 and @entity1 's @entity22 make a miserable team			1
she 's selfish , he sacrifices his career , are you laughing yet ? we are given to understand that wedded bliss would make all the difference , but somehow they just ca n't get their act together			1
@entity10 proposes in the movie 's very first scene			1
there is an engagement party , everything is going swimmingly , but events overtake them			1
@entity22 's sister ( @entity45 ) gets pregnant by @entity47 best man ( @entity46 , doing a big - screen tweak on his " @entity50 " persona ) , so their nuptials take precedence			2
there are religious and geographical divisions to be ironed out -- @entity10 's family is @entity56 , @entity22 's @entity57			0
then she 's offered a place at the @entity60 , and while @entity10 renounces his promising culinary career in @entity62 to be with her , somehow the circumstances do n't seem so propitious for a wedding ceremony			0
she 's still happy , but he 's stuck in a rut and losing his grip			0
delay and deferment do n't seem like the ideal building blocks for comedy , especially when this couple already lives together			0
are we expected to care that much if they tie the knot ? does their hesitation reflect misgivings about the institution , or doubts about the relationship itself ? the latter , naturally , but only because @entity10 is asked to play second fiddle to his more goal - oriented @entity83 e. in other words , to play what is traditionally the part of the supportive wife			2
what is a man to do when he 's no longer the principal breadwinner ? @entity91 is cold , and they hunt things there			0
going native involves home - knitted sweaters , crossbows and lots of facial hair			2
clearly , this is not going to work			0
the movie occasionally throws up scenes or situations adults might recognize from their own attempts to reconcile romance and professional fulfillment , but no more than you might find in an average sitcom			2
this being a @entity113 production , that would be a sitcom afflicted with @entity115 and more male nudity than usual , but still essentially a sitcom nonetheless			0
ungainly and uneven , the movie offers some compensation in the peripherals ( whoever cast @entity122 , the terrifying matriarch from " @entity123 " as @entity22 's mum has a wicked sense of humor , and @entity127 is lively as a charismatic psychology professor ) but struggles to convey any sense of purpose in its story			1
rom - coms traditionally end in marriage , convenient shorthand for the fairytale happy ever after , and " the five - year engagement " is no different ; it just takes an awfully long time to get there .			1

@entity11 is one of those actors who has learned to capitalize on his flaws
for most of " the five - year engagement " lead characters make a miserable team
ungainly and uneven , the movie offers some compensation in the peripherals
