-- he was not able to fulfill his childhood dream of being a pilot , but @entity5 scientist dr. @entity6 has arguably gone one better : developing and flying spacecrafts for @entity8			1
the moon , @entity10 and beyond : all are in the sights of dr. @entity6			0
the 43 - year - old did n't enter orbit when controlling @entity16 and @entity17 rockets for @entity8 , instead piloting them from the control center on the ground			1
nevertheless from growing up in @entity5 to being an astronautical engineer and strategist for @entity8 , he has had a similarly stratospheric rise to the top			1
growing up in @entity25 , @entity6 was fascinated by science and how things worked			2
" i was a very curious kid and i always questioned lots of things , and most of my friends i grew up with , they knew that			0
and my parents , they were a little bit concerned because sometimes i would take apart a lot of things they would not want me to touch , " he told @entity0			0
when he realized he could not become a pilot because of his eyesight he channeled his energies into studying engineering , moving to the @entity41 to complete a course in electrical engineering at @entity44			1
on graduating @entity6 initially planned to return to @entity5 to develop solar technologies , but then @entity8 came calling in 1995			1
" i never did dream of working for @entity8			2
i admired what they did , but it never did cross my mind			0
i did not see how a kid like me could work for @entity8 , " he said			2
he commanded his first spacecraft from @entity8 's @entity53 and has gone on to develop an extra-vehicular infra - red camera as well as other projects for the space agency			1
while he did n't return to @entity5 as he originally planned , he still believes that his work -- and @entity8 's -- has had some benefits to his native country and more down - to - earth lives			1
" well , @entity8 has done a lot for @entity62			1
maybe @entity62 they no know that			2
they have cell phones , glasses , anti-scratch and all those things			0
we have portable water system that @entity8 has developed for @entity62			1
they 're using it , " he said			0
" and one thing people often forget , @entity8 does n't only develop space technology , we also develop aeronautical technology			2
so when the planes they fly and other flying objects , @entity8 's technology has been involved in that			1
" @entity6 is also keen to pass on the message that for @entity83 , the sky is the limit in terms of what they do with their lives			0
" i 've learned that being given the freedom to think and think openly helps bring in new ideas			0
so in community , like in an @entity62 communities , i think younger generations and both the old and the young should freely share ideas and break those old barriers			0
" so i believe that with some determination and some hard work most of the younger generation can get whatever they want to			0
they can even go into space , they can do anything			0

@entity107 - @entity5 engineer is one of @entity8 's top strategists
grew up in @entity25 before studying in @entity41 ; *joined* @entity8 in 1995
has *remotely* piloted space craft ; believes other @entity62 can follow in his footsteps
