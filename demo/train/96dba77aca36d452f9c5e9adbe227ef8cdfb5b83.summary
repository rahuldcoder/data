-- @entity2 journalism is under siege			1
with no settlement yet on press regulation following last year 's judicial inquiry into phone hacking , this week has seen another seminal moment			2
once again @entity9 , now clearly one of the crusading newspapers of the world , is at the heart of matters			0
the detention of the partner of @entity9 journalist @entity17 by security officials at @entity19 in @entity20 has unleashed a virulent debate about the place of the free press and the role of the state			1
the fact that obscure terrorism legislation was cited to hold him for nine hours and confiscate his computer equipment has added a further twist			2
in the past , police would be required to obtain court orders that could be contested before they could seize journalistic materials			0
now the ill - defined threat of terror seems to excuse the tactics of a despotic state			2
a former editor of @entity40 in @entity20 , @entity41 , wrote that " harassing the family of those who have upset authority is the most obscene form of state terrorism , " adding that " the hysteria of the ' war on terror ' is now corrupting every area of democratic government			1
" on the other hand , the @entity2 's @entity51 said @entity17 's partner @entity53 was carrying " highly sensitive stolen information that would help terrorism , " and those who oppose his detention should think about what they are condoning			1
former conservative member of parliament @entity60 told the @entity62 that @entity64 's actions were endangering the lives of @entity67 and @entity2 agents			1
but @entity64 was released without charge , with no suggestion he was seeking to help terrorists , and he is taking legal action against the @entity2 authorities for the return of his property			1
this has polarized positions into a black and white , good or bad debate			0
if you support a free press publishing leaked state secrets you are apparently condoning terrorism			1
if you do n't object to his detention loudly , you are condoning the secret state			1
unlike the @entity67 , @entity2 has no @entity86 to protect the role of the free press			1
like so much of the @entity2 constitution , it is an unwritten assumption			1
reason lies in the complicated middle ground -- unfashionable as that may be			1
social media , advocacy journalism , the need to define and claim the narrative and to be heard leaves little room for middle ground , but it is there that this conflict will be resolved			1
in that gray area , the ethical bridge between these positions will have to be rebuilt			0
as a start , we should acknowledge some plain truths			0
first , journalists have responsibilities toward the state , and governments have responsibilities toward a free and open press			2
radical transparency , which would release anything and everything , is not what any responsible news organization , including the @entity9 , would support			0
equally , government agencies , however shadowy , need to recognize that journalism is a legitimate -- indeed essential -- activity in a democratic society , especially when it is inconvenient , embarrassing or blows secrets you would have preferred to remain hidden			2
second , if you reveal a country 's national secrets you should n't be surprised if its security services take an aggressive interest in you			2
this does n't mean you were wrong to report them			0
family members and loved ones should not have to carry public responsibility for your professional actions			0
but when they act as couriers for your work , they are more than family members and loved ones -- they are your proxy and will attract as much interest from the authorities			0
third , journalism is not terrorism , so terrorism laws should not be used to intimidate journalists			1
there is no suggestion that @entity53 was planning to hand material to terrorists -- as the authorities well know			0
governments embarrassed by the latest rounds of whistleblowing would like to cast a chill across investigative journalism			0
but it is not in the interests of a free society to allow that to happen			0
at heart , the issue is the legitimate scope and role of intelligence and security operations in a modern liberal democracy			1
as a first stab , they should be as small as necessary -- recognizing that serious threats to @entity173 states mean their activities are bound to be , and need to be , of significant scale			0
what matters is how their powers are used and their accountability			0
it 's what a country 's moral authority rests upon			0
@entity67 and @entity2 authorities acting against legitimate newsgathering need to reflect on what it says about their democratic values			2
seizing @entity190 phone records or intimidating the families of journalists will have some in @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 rubbing their hands with glee			0
many believe the @entity2 's security operations ' insufficient scrutiny and accountability make them untrustworthy			1
even @entity203 , @entity2 's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation , is calling for a wide public and parliamentary debate on this law			1
at least that debate seems certain to happen			0
and it is better that the discussion about the state and journalism centers on a piece of public interest , serious journalism than over the criminal antics of @entity217 's phone hackers			1
what may have started last weekend as a clumsy piece of intimidation could have far wider consequences			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224 .			2

@entity224 : @entity2 journalism under siege with detention of @entity17 's partner
@entity231 : a middle ground exists between the state as despot or *defender* of *citizenry*
he says terrorism laws should not be used to bully reporters , as they were in this case
@entity231 : issue is the scope of security operations in a modern liberal democracy
