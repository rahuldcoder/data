@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the @entity4 military pursues charges against the @entity7 sergeant accused of killing @entity1 civilians in what commanders say was a freelance rampage , a new question has arisen : who was victim no. 17 ? staff sgt. @entity15 has been charged with 17 counts of murder " with premeditation " in the march 11 slayings in the @entity21 district of @entity1 's @entity22			1
but @entity1 authorities have said there were 16 people killed in the @entity21 killings			2
sunday , two @entity1 provincial council members said the @entity4 has paid the victims ' families a total of $ 860,000 -- $ 10,000 for each of the six wounded survivors , and $ 50,000 apiece for the 16 dead			1
@entity1 government officials in @entity0 have said they have no record of another death			1
a @entity4 official confirmed that a payment had been made on saturday -- but the official , who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation , said he could not comment on the figure involved			2
the discrepancy has persisted since friday , when the charge sheet on @entity44 listed four women among 17 victims , while initial @entity4 and @entity1 reports listed three women among 16 dead			1
a @entity50 spokesman , col. @entity49 , said friday only that investigators assigned to the case felt they had evidence to charge @entity44 with 17 counts of murder			1
authorities say @entity44 left his remote outpost before dawn on march 11 and went house - to - house , gunning down villagers in two villages near the @entity4 base			2
they have said that he acted alone , leaving the outpost in the dead of night and turning himself in to his comrades when he returned			0
the @entity4 official who handed over the money to the families said the payments were not compensation , but the @entity4 government offering to help the victims and their families , @entity22 provincial council member @entity69 said			1
but @entity49 said the money was compensation for the families			2
it was not immediately clear if the word used to describe the payment had legal significance in @entity1 , where " blood money " can replace a trial or punishment of a killer			2
@entity1 are insisting that @entity44 be returned to @entity1 to face trial , with villagers and lawmakers questioning the @entity4 military 's account of what happened			1
but a military official in @entity1 has said that @entity44 will be tried in the @entity4			1
@entity69 , the local official , said the money was paid in @entity1 currency and handed over in @entity98			1
he did not name the @entity4 official involved in the meeting			2
while the identity of the 17th victim remained unknown sunday , a @entity4 official did disclose a new detail of the case sunday			0
the official , who would not speak on the record because the investigation is ongoing , told @entity2 that investigators now believe @entity44 committed the shootings during two separate trips out of the @entity4 compound			1
" we believe the shooter went to one village , came back and went to a second village , " the official said , based on factors including interviews and the overall investigation			0
@entity44 could face the death penalty if convicted of any of the murder counts against him			1
he is being held at @entity125 , @entity126 , after being flown out of @entity1 a few days after the killings			0
it is not clear whether he will now face a military procedure known as an @entity130 , at which military authorities would determine whether to proceed with charges against him , or whether he will go before a group of experts to determine whether his mental health may be a factor in his defense			0
if and when the case comes to trial , @entity44 ' lawyer , @entity141 , said , it is going to be " extremely difficult " for the prosecution			0
" they have no murder scene , no forensics , " the lawyer said thursday night outside his @entity147 office			0
" i 'm going to make them prove every claim			0
" military law experts acknowledge that proving the case may be difficult , especially given that there are no autopsies to help prove the cause of death -- in part because those killed were buried quickly , in accordance with @entity163 tradition -- and difficulty in getting witnesses to testify			0
but @entity166 , a former @entity167 lawyer and current @entity169 professor , told @entity2 that any bullet rounds recovered from the scene could be matched with @entity44 ' weapon -- assuming it was " immediately seized " -- which would serve as " powerful evidence for the government			0
" the dead have been identified as @entity177 , @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , and @entity192			0
@entity2 's @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 contributed to this report .			0
