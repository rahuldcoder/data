@entity0 -- a hasidic @entity5 recruit is planning a lawsuit after being dismissed for refusing to trim his beard for religious reasons , his attorney said sunday			1
@entity10 , 38 , was asked to leave the police academy on friday , his attorney , @entity9 , told @entity1			1
he began the police academy in january , he said , was in the top 1 % of his classes and is " highly regarded " by his peers			1
the dismissal , @entity9 said , is a clear example of " religious discrimination			0
" " we are planning to bring a lawsuit , " the attorney said			0
" this should not be a practice of the @entity5			2
" @entity5 deputy commissioner @entity22 said in a statement the department " makes reasonable accommodations in this regard			1
" beards for religious purposes are to be kept to 1 millimeter in length , he said , adding that there are other @entity32 and @entity33 uniformed members who observe the accommodation			1
@entity10 " did not comply with the @entity5 's reasonable accommodation to keep his beard trimmed , " @entity35 said			1
" he did not keep it trimmed to 1mm and he stated that it was his intention to never cut or trim his beard			0
" but @entity10 said as an @entity40 , " i have left my beard natural all my life			2
it 's the law of the @entity44			0
" in a march 18 statement to @entity5 officials , provided to @entity1 by @entity9 , @entity10 wrote , " it is absolutely forbidden in my religious beliefs to cut or trim my beard in any way			1
" when @entity10 received the phone call that he was accepted into the police academy , it was the " happiest day of my life , " he said			1
" the impact you can make in the community in a neighborhood and a people ... you can truly make a direct impact on a whole entire community as a police officer			0
" @entity10 wrote that after receiving a 97.6 % on his entrance exam last year , he " inquired about keeping my naturally short beard intact " and filled out a religious accommodation form			2
he received a short letter saying the matter would be addressed when he became a recruit			0
after being selected for the 2012 class , the father of five said he resigned his job			0
" since i had applied for an exemption before i was accepted and had already been photographed , i believed that the @entity5 was aware of my religious needs and accepted me knowing i needed to keep my beard intact , " he wrote			2
while in classes , @entity10 three times was told he would have to cut or shave his beard , he said			2
each time , he refused , citing his religious beliefs , @entity9 said			0
he was also punished with the loss of two vacation days , according to @entity10 's memo			2
he noted that other officers have beards , adding , " i was told many times in the academy , ' cut your beard , after the academy you 'll never have to , ' " @entity10 said			1
" it 's an unenforced rule			0
" " i can not , as a matter of religious conscience , follow that instruction because i may not trim my beard even temporarily to complete the academy , " he wrote			0
" one of the points that has been drilled home during my short time at the academy is the need to represent the @entity5 with integrity , " @entity10 wrote to police officials			1
" although not knowing whether i will be punished for maintaining my religious beliefs has been very taxing on me and my family , i will not waver in my firm belief that i can be a successful member of the @entity5 and an @entity33 at the same time			1
" he said that as his academic and physical scores show , " i am focused on dedicating myself to being the best probationary police officer i can be			0
" asked if other factors could have contributed to @entity10 's dismissal , @entity9 said , " i do n't think it 's anything else ... he would -- will be , i believe -- an outstanding police officer			1
" @entity113 president @entity112 said in a statement sunday he was " deeply troubled " by the reports @entity10 was fired for refusing to trim his beard			0
" the @entity5 has done a commendable job in recent years of building a police force that tries to reflect the populations that they serve , " @entity112 said			1
" @entity10 should be no exception			0
i urge the police commissioner to reconsider this case as well as the @entity5 's rules about religious accommodation more broadly and , in so doing , to make a clear statement in support of religious expression for all			2
