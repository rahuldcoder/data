@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's @entity3 withdrew the invitation of a far - right politician to her garden party thursday after he " blatantly politicized " it , @entity2 said			1
@entity8 , the controversial leader of the @entity9 , was among thousands of guests due to attend one of the queen 's three annual summer garden parties at @entity2			1
he was invited because he is an elected member of the @entity14 -- and disinvited because his politicizing the invitation " increased the security threat and the potential discomfort " to other guests , @entity2 said			1
the palace said @entity8 " overtly used his personal invitation for party political purposes through the media			2
" the @entity9 leader called the withdrawal of the invitation an " attack on democracy , the media , freedom of speech and one million @entity4 patriots			1
" he said the reason given for the reversal was " invented nonsense " and that citing " natural media interest " in him to cancel the invitation was " a disgusting disregard for democracy in @entity4			2
" and he warned that " blatant attempts at gagging the @entity9 always backfires ( sic )			2
" @entity8 posted the statement on the @entity9 website and e-mailed it to supporters as a fundraising solicitation			1
he had said a day earlier that he would be attending the party " for the 1 million @entity4 patriots who now vote for this party despite all the hate from the media liars , the old parties and their thuggish far - left allies			0
" he asked readers of the @entity9 website for their suggestions about what he should say to the @entity3 " if -- presumably due to some ghastly blunder by a courtier -- i actually meet her ? " @entity8 was elected to the @entity14 last year along with another @entity9 member			1
