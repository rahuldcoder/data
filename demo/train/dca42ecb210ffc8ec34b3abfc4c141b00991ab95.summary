-- @entity2 rock group @entity1 turned the music industry on its head today , releasing its seventh studio album " in rainbows " as a digital download from the band 's web site			1
@entity1 is offering downloads of their new album , " in @entity6 , " at whatever price listeners see fit to pay			1
in a move journalists and industry insiders called part experiment , part marketing genius , @entity1 let listeners pick their price for the album			1
" it 's up to you , " reads a disclaimer on the web site 's checkout screen			1
thousands of fans who purchased the album ahead of time received unique download activation codes this morning			1
@entity0 received its code at 1:34 a.m. et and had no problem downloading the 10 new tracks			0
the whole process took about 90 seconds			0
much of the music world has been abuzz since members of @entity1 -- who finished their commitment to longtime label home @entity38 in 2005 -- announced plans to distribute their album via web site october 1			1
@entity0 asked readers for their thoughts on @entity1 's release , and how much they would be willing to pay for music			1
below is a selection of their responses , some of which have been edited for length and clarity			0
@entity56 of @entity57 , @entity58 it 's hard to predict the future of someone 's musical quality , but its not hard to rely on someone 's past quality			1
i believe that @entity1 discography speaks for itself and speaks to me			1
i paid full price , give or take a nickel -- $ 10.49 after conversion			0
i 'm sure this idea scares other artists who rely on @entity71 to shove an album down your throat to get you to buy it			2
or better yet , rely on one decent single to carry a crappy album			2
hopefully , this idea will bring back the album as well as take some of that loot out of the record labels ' hands and give it back to the artists			2
either way , i 'm listening to " in rainbows " right now and feel like i may owe @entity1 a few extra bucks			1
it 's great , just like i knew it would be			2
think i may take this lucky streak to @entity91 and put it all on black			0
@entity93 of @entity94 , @entity95 i will not be spending money on the download , but i will be buying the deluxe edition of " in rainbows " later this year , if i like the album			1
if they 're offering something for free , i see no moral objection to taking them up on it			0
... people are saying @entity1 's decision to release their new album in this manner might signal the death of the music industry			1
personally , i have a hard time buying that			0
@entity1 has a very large fan base and does n't need much promotion , marketing or the other things that a label often takes care of			1
getting yourself noticed is very hard if you 're plankton in the @entity123			0
@entity124 of @entity125 , @entity126 i 'm planning on paying a hundred dollars @entity128 flat for my download of " in rainbows " by @entity1			1
i 'm not getting the special vinyl and @entity133 set , just the ordinary download			2
i believe , that as a musician , it is an investment in my future			0
i want to send a message			0
" keep your corporate conglomerate out of my artwork			0
" @entity142 of @entity143 , @entity144 i like remix versions of dance songs and international hits , which can be very hard to find , especially here in the @entity128 if i want a song bad enough , i 've paid as much as $ 15 for a cd with just remixes of one song on it			0
when i can find what i want online , i really think that @entity154 's 99 cents per song strategy is the best pricing for me			2
i wished they 'd check their quality , though , as sometimes it sounds like they just ripped some bargain cd instead of using a high - end copy			2
higher pricing will just make me obtain the songs in another way			0
i worked previously in the music industry for six years and i know how much it costs to make a cd			0
more than 25 percent of the retail price , or approximately $ 4 , is packaging			0
a 12 - song album is $ 12 with $ 0.00 going to packaging , so in the end , everyone from the labels to the artists to the distributor is making money			1
@entity176 of @entity177 , @entity95 i think this is the greatest way for a band to take their music directly to the world			2
i have been a fan of @entity1 for almost 10 years and i have never been as excited for an upcoming album as i am for " in @entity6			1
" i already pre-ordered my copy and i paid exactly what i would have if it had been on @entity186			0
@entity187 , outside of @entity188 , @entity189 i plan on downloading the new @entity1 album as soon as it becomes available , and will pay 7 euros , which as of october 9 , is about $ 9.87 in the @entity128 -- $ 9.99 is the price of most albums on @entity186 , and i think this is a fair price for what i expect will become a classic and favorite of mine , alongside every other @entity1 album i own			1
i admire @entity1 for their initiative in not only pushing the boundaries of content distribution , but for also placing the mantle of trust squarely into their fan 's hands			1
i 'm sure some will rationalize downloading the album for free , re-distributing it on [ peer - to - peer ] networks , etc. , saying , " oh , the band is wealthy enough , they do n't need my $ 10 , " but i think it 's important to recognize the investment in time and creative energy a band like @entity1 pours into every album			1
i 'm fairly certain that i 'll end up with a positive [ return on investment ] on this transaction - how much is hours and hours of enjoyment and listening to good music worth ? surely more than $ 9.99			2
@entity224 of @entity225 , @entity58 i will probably pay $ 9.99 for the album and download it			1
as for music that inspires me to crack open my wallet , there are tons of bands i would still buy an album from			2
however , very few of those bands are mainstream acts			0
the problem is corporate record companies and the music industry itself used to focus on the quality of the music rather than the sex appeal or image that the artist now poses			0
@entity71 is at fault and has been since the late 90s when they brought boy bands and other teeny bop stars into the mainstream			0
as for those artists that are not mainstream , there are plenty of bands i still buy albums from			0
albums that reflect excellent songwriting skills usually 100 percent of the time from the artists themselves			0
more important , those artists put on great , non-lip syncing live shows which make you appreciate them even more			0
so yeah , i say if the record companies are going to ruin the integrity of music by releasing crap , then download mainstream albums , but the underground world has plenty that a real music fan would enjoy			2
@entity1 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 , etc. ... the list is infinite ( of bands whose music i would buy ) -- but notice that the list does not involve any crap			1
