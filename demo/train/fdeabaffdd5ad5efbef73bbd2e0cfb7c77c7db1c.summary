-- a history of childhood abuse and use of a provocative online identity increase the risk that girls will be victimized by someone they meet on the @entity8 , according to a study appearing in the june issue of @entity11			1
a study in @entity11 sought to identify which risk factors are linked to @entity8 - initiated victimization of girls			1
while highlighting the dangers that exist for adolescent girls , the study 's authors also offer a word to parents : you can lessen the risks to your children by monitoring their internet use			1
the authors sought to identify risk factors connected to increased rates of @entity8 - initiated victimization of girls			1
they also wanted to find out whether abuse victims showed increased vulnerability to online victimization			2
they found that girls are more likely to experience online sexual advances or have offline encounters if they have previously been abused or have a provocative avatar , which is a digital image meant to represent the user online			2
those two factors pose a greater risk to adolescents than perhaps more traditionally considered risks , such as @entity8 naivete and sexual innocence , the study says			1
the authors say many @entity8 - initiated sex crimes originate on social networking sites , which require users to create online identities			1
some sites , such as @entity52 , require users to create a character to represent them in the virtual world			0
the program presents users with hundreds of possibilities spanning all shapes and sizes ; users can choose anything from a fully dressed persona to a scantily clad one			0
they also can select features such as hair color and figure			0
other sites , such as @entity69 and @entity70 , allow self - descriptions and photographs			0
but even there , users can choose what to post , and those identities can shape behavior and interaction online , the study says			2
" the extent to which provocative self - presentations ... translate into increased online advances or offline encounters is unknown , but it is plausible that these types of presentations constitute an initial invitation for exploitation and a familiar avenue by which sexual advances are initiated , " the study says			1
the study 's lead author was @entity94 of the @entity95 in @entity96			0
the report appears in @entity11 , the journal of the @entity99			2
@entity94 and her co-authors cite the @entity102 effect , or the idea that the presentation of oneself can affect the behavior of the presenter and the receiver			0
" self - presentations can change the way @entity8 users interact in a manner that increases the risk for online sexual advances , " they say			1
the study looked at 104 abused and 69 non-abused girls ages 14 to 17			2
abused adolescents -- who had suffered neglect , physical abuse or sexual abuse -- were recruited from child protective agencies , the authors said			2
of the girls studied , 54 percent were white and 46 percent were minorities , of which 82 percent were black and 18 percent were mixed - race , the authors say			0
the authors held a laboratory session in which they asked the girls to create avatars on a program designed to mimic a popular social networking site , which the authors did not name in the study			2
girls could choose bust and hip size , clothing type , visible navel piercings and skin , eye and hair colors			0
girls were given a range of choices that allowed for a more provocative or conservative avatar			0
participants were also asked to rate how many times they had had online sexual advances , which were described as " explicit sexual chatting in virtual worlds , " and how many times they had met someone in person after meeting first online			0
the authors say 40 percent of the girls reported experiencing sexual advances online , and 26 percent reported meeting someone offline after getting to know the person on the @entity8			1
abused girls were much more likely to have experienced both , the authors found			0
" results indicated that abuse status was significantly related to online sexual advances , which were , in turn , related to offline , in - person encounters , " the study says			1
the authors say there was no direct link between abuse and offline encounters , but that a history of abuse puts girls at greater risk			1
looking at the girls ' avatar choices , the authors found that girls who present themselves provocatively in body and clothing choices are more likely to have had online sexual advances			1
that risk is tied not just to an avatar , but to the overall image a girl projects online , they say			0
on sites that do n't use avatars , such as @entity69 or @entity70 , simply compiling suggestive photographs or narrative descriptions can increase girls ' vulnerability , they say			0
" those adolescents who may be unaware of how their appearance might be perceived may not , from a developmental perspective , possess the social sophistication necessary to field and ward off sexual advances in ways that protect them from sexually explicit suggestions , " the study says			0
" this may be a particularly important lesson to convey to female adolescents who are especially vulnerable to exploitation and victimization , such as those who have been victims of childhood abuse , " it says			1
one significant factor that helped decrease the risk to girls was the presence and influence of caregivers , the authors found			1
they urge parents to be aware of how their adolescent girls present themselves on the @entity8 and be aware that provocative self - presentation might have implications for sexual solicitation			1
" caregiver presence was associated with significantly fewer reports by adolescents of online solicitations , " the study says			0
" as such , the importance of parental monitoring of adolescent internet use can not be understated			0

study in june issue of @entity11 identifies risk factors from @entity8 *predators*
study finds childhood abuse , use of sexy images puts girls at increased risk
these factors more crucial than @entity8 naivete or sexual innocence , study indicates
authors urge caregivers to carefully monitor how girls present themselves online
