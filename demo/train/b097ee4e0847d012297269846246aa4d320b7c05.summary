-- @entity2 's rebranding of the widely used but culturally fading @entity4 service is off to a big start			1
more than 1 million people signed up for e-mail accounts with @entity8 , the new service to which all @entity4 users will eventually be transferred , in its first few hours of existence tuesday			1
but one important person apparently did n't , at least not using his full name in his address : @entity2 ceo @entity15			1
staffers at the @entity18 website were able to register @entity19			0
they were n't the only ones to notice the apparent quirk			0
one @entity23 user also claims to have secured donotreply@outlook.com			0
" [ c ] a n't wait to see all the spam i get , " he wrote			0
but it was the @entity15 grab that turned heads			2
it quickly led to the parody @entity29 account , @entity15 on @entity30 , on which spoof e-mails from the ceo are posted			2
in one , the phony @entity15 sends a photo to an account made to look like it belongs to the former @entity2 ceo , philanthropist @entity35			1
the fake @entity35 ' response ? " would you please not bother me with this s --- ? i am trying to cure @entity40			0
" the jokes do highlight at least one positive for @entity2 , though : people in the tech world are talking about @entity4 ( or at least its replacement )			2
the e-mail service has long remained the world 's most popular , largely due to it being bundled with the near - ubiquitious @entity49 operating system			1
but it had long since lost its cachet with younger or tech - industry users , and by some accounts has been surpassed by @entity55 's @entity54			2
but some early reviews of the new outlook e-mail service have been glowing			1
" after a decade as a punchline , @entity4 just pulled off the biggest victory in the inbox game since @entity54			0
and it might just get you to switch , " wrote @entity61 on @entity62			0
shortly after 3 p.m. et tuesday , the @entity23 account posted a chart showing the million sign - ups			1
right now , switching to @entity8 is voluntary for @entity4 users			1
they 'll eventually have no choice , although @entity2 has not disclosed a timetable for that move .			0

@entity2 's new outlook e-mail service gets 1 million sign - ups in a few hours
one user was able to grab an address with ceo @entity15 's name
