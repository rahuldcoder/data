the world has devoted a great deal of diplomatic energy to securing @entity4 's chemical weapons			1
it has yet to do the same for securing @entity4 's children			1
their future is as important for international security and stability , even if the consequences of inaction will take far longer to be seen and felt			0
the war in @entity4 between the government of @entity15 and forces opposed to him has ground on for more than two years and claims new victims each day			2
more than 100,000 have been killed			0
starvation has become a gruesome reality , with a religious leader now saying it is ok to eat cats and dogs given the lack of much of anything else			0
@entity26 , likely brought by foreign fighters , has resurfaced to claim tiny victims younger than 2			0
in the past two weeks , barrel bombs -- drums filled with shrapnel and explosives -- are reported to have killed more than 500 people in the city of @entity35			2
according to the @entity37 , a @entity38 - based group with links to @entity4 opposition , children accounted for more than 150 of the dead			1
refugees fleeing the conflict , most to @entity4 's overwhelmed neighbors @entity42 and @entity43 , top a whopping 2 million			1
some @entity48 officials expect that number to climb as high as 4 million in 2014			0
more than 1.1 million of these refugees are younger than 18			0
indeed , @entity4 's youngest citizens are paying dearly for a war they did not create , one that is laying waste to their present and their future			1
three out of four @entity4 children " have lost a close friend or family member in their country 's ongoing conflict " and " many have witnessed violence , " notes the @entity57			1
charities such as @entity57 and @entity67 working with @entity4 's children tell of young people isolated , lonely and struggling with the impossible task of coming to terms with all that they have seen and lost			1
" if we do not act quickly , a generation of innocents will become lasting casualties of an appalling war , " @entity48 high commissioner for refugees @entity73 said in november when releasing a report on the grim future facing @entity4 's children			1
" a grave consequence of the conflict is that a generation is growing up without a formal education , " the report said			0
" more than half of all school - aged @entity4 children in @entity42 and @entity43 are not in school			2
in @entity43 , it is estimated that some 200,000 school - aged @entity4 refugee children could remain out of school at the end of the year			2
" they join 25 million kids of primary - school - age around the world out of school because of war			0
these numbers matter and well beyond @entity4 's borders			1
as @entity104 education secretary @entity103 has often noted , security and education are bound together : low educational attainment is among the strongest predictors of violence			0
anyone hoping for a safer , more secure world had better start with educating children			2
and yet until now , the international community 's reaction to the escalating death count and the rising number of hungry , homeless and displaced children has fallen somewhere between a shrug and a sigh			0
although @entity48 agencies have released a slew of dire warnings about the situation 's urgency and its gravity , it is unclear anyone is listening , let alone ready to act to change the calculus on the ground			0
in september , a round of feverish and focused diplomacy unfolded between @entity130 and the @entity104 to reach a deal with the @entity15 regime on its chemical weapons			1
no nations have engaged in such fully concentrated diplomacy to open and secure humanitarian corridors and bring supplies to cities being starved and cut off from the rest of the world -- and to make sure @entity4 's children do n't go hungry			1
although chemical weapons may be close to being secured , conventional weapons face no such limitations and are being used to kill , injure and maim with impunity			1
this leaves children to pay the price			2
and so will the rest of us , eventually , if nothing is done to help a lost generation find a way to a more secure future .			0

@entity156 : nations have tried to secure @entity4 's chemical weapons but not to help children
@entity156 : children suffer from starvation and polio , killed by *airstrikes* and bombs
she says chemical weapons close to being secured , but not conventional weapons
children pay the price , she says . the world has turned its back on them
