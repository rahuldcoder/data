-- @entity1 was always overweight			1
when he visited his relatives in @entity4 , they would jokingly say , " the sumo wrestler is back			1
" their comments were meant to be funny , but @entity1 still felt the sting			1
@entity1 and his wife @entity9 had their daughter @entity10 in 2006			1
like many toddlers , @entity10 would run around their @entity15 , @entity14 , home , and @entity1 would trail behind her , trying to catch up			1
but as she got older , keeping up with @entity10 became a struggle for him , both physically and mentally			1
" i would oftentimes be so out of breath that i would almost pass out , " he said			1
at this point , his diet mainly consisted of burgers , fries and sub sandwiches , and at least six cans of soda a day			1
by 2010 , the 37 - year - old , standing at 5 ' 10 , hit his peak weight of 270 pounds			1
" it was the lowest point of my life , " he said			1
he had to start wearing @entity32 shirts because the xxl was too small			2
@entity1 became reclusive -- even to his family			1
often he would shut himself in the basement where he could be alone to eat while sitting at the computer with the curtains drawn			2
but @entity10 , then 4 years old , would find her way down to the basement and beg him to play with her			2
seeing the strain he was putting on himself and his family depressed @entity1 , and by @entity43 , something snapped			1
he did n't want to miss out on his daughter growing up			2
he did n't want to be tired and alone anymore			2
he did n't want to feel bad about himself			2
he wanted to change his life			2
but like so many , he had a horrible track record of failed diets and exercise attempts			2
he had tried countless diets in the past , and had joined a handful of gyms , that he paid for despite never going			2
" i would try crazy fad diets like eating tofu for two weeks			2
i would cling on to anything to lose weight with the least amount of work , " he said			1
but those fad diets would never last more than a few weeks , and his weight would rebound			1
even his wife was skeptical of his newfound inspiration to lose weight			1
" she would eat those types of ( rich ) foods in front of me jokingly , but that skepticism was the fuel			2
i wanted to prove people wrong , " he said			2
he was determined to not make the same mistakes again			2
this time , he was going to focus on losing weight by restricting his diet first			1
then he would slowly incorporate exercise			2
part of that decision came from the fear of hurting himself after spending years without working out			2
committing to healthier foods kirimoto drastically cut down on his sugar and carbohydrate intake six days a week , and used saturday as his cheat day where he could eat whatever he wanted			2
his breakfast burrito was replaced with a light yogurt and a hard boiled egg or an apple			2
he started taking a salad to work , a dramatic shift from the fast food lunches he used to consume during his workday			2
although his dinners at home had always been relatively healthy -- stir fry or cooked vegetables with white rice -- @entity1 would typically eat too much , sometimes consuming two or three meals ' worth of food in one sitting			1
" i would eat a whole bowl of rice or big servings of stir fry			2
i would eat ' til i was full , then you sort of become numb to the fullness , " he said			2
that changed as he started making a conscious effort to watch his portion sizes			0
he remembers the intense feeling of withdrawal			0
" my body really was asking for richer and fattier foods , " he said			0
it was a struggle to resist delicacies like pizza and pasta , or even pantry staples like rice and bread			0
but the cravings slowly subsided and he noticed that even on his cheat day he was eating smaller portions			0
at the start of 2011 , @entity1 began a fitness routine			1
he started lifting weights three days a week at the gym before work			0
it felt awkward at first , as he tried to get used to the rhythm of his body , but those feelings dissipated as he gained more energy and confidence			0
@entity133 through the year , he incorporated running into his workout routine			0
he was now running and lifting weights five days a week			0
it was a momentous step for @entity1 , who says he used to treat running like a joke			1
" unless i was being chased by a bear or axe murderer , it was never something i did , " he wrote in his @entity139			0
by december 2011 , he had dropped 81 pounds			1
but @entity1 felt like his treadmill runs were getting him nowhere -- literally			1
" i just felt like a hamster on a wheel , the only thing missing was the water bottle , " he recalled			0
he told colleague @entity149 about his frustrations			0
making fitness an adventure @entity149 , a @entity154 - born @entity14 transplant , is a fitness enthusiast			0
she is known around the office for using her lunch breaks at work to escape into the @entity14 trails for a quick 30 - minute run			0
she became a person @entity1 confided in throughout his fitness journey , whether it was about struggles he had at the gym or nutrition advice			1
" i am a big believer of eating food in its purest form , " @entity149 said			0
" he used to make fun of me when i ate an apple or vegetables for a snack , but as he started losing he changed his diet , and started eating pure , natural foods too			1
" when it came to running , @entity149 told @entity1 : " we live in @entity14			1
one of the most beautiful states with many trails , and you need to take advantage of it , " he recalled			0
that piece of advice inspired him to start running outside			0
the first run was tough			0
the ground was n't as soft as the treadmill 's belt back at the gym , and gravity seemed to pull him down , @entity1 said			1
what he did n't expect from running outside was the sensory overload			0
he had lived in @entity14 for more than 25 years , and this was the first time he had run outside			0
the vibrant colors of the leaves , the green grass , the blue sky -- it hooked him			0
as soon as @entity1 started running @entity14 's trails , he fell in love			1
outside , he could finally breathe			0
his 15 minute runs transformed into 30 minutes and he gradually found himself running longer and faster			1
by february 2012 , @entity1 ran his first @entity203 race			1
" i never entered a race before			0
i was alone and nervous			0
i had no idea if i was going to finish , " he said			0
" when i crossed the finish line ... i felt so fantastic			0
" that year he did 10 races			0
at the end of 2012 , he had shed a total of 94 pounds and was now running as far as 6 miles on his running days			1
the following year , he took his trail runs to a new level and joined a local running group			1
in january of this year , he encouraged his wife and daughter to partake in physical activities as well			0
they had a day during the week where they would do short runs around the neighborhood , usually around a mile of jogging			1
eventually those 1 - milers with his daughter @entity10 became 2 miles ; then she was regularly running 3 miles with him			0
in march , the father - daughter - duo entered a 4 - mile race in @entity228			0
@entity10 , now 7 , was nervous because she had never run more than 3 miles before			0
but that did n't stop her from crushing the race , @entity1 said			1
@entity10 ran without stopping , clocking a 12 - minute and 39 - second mile pace			0
today , he and his daughter go on 6 - mile runs together every sunday			1
it 's become a father - daughter bonding time for them			1
" it is a million times more satisfying to run with her			0
to see my own child run and have fun is incredible , " he said			0
by july , @entity1 's weight was down to 168 pounds			1
he has lost a total of 102 pounds since 2010			1
through all his achievements , @entity1 has inspired a lot of his closest friends and co-workers , @entity149 said			1
" i think everyone is very impressed , " she said			0
" he made that choice for himself and for his family			0
" passing that inspiration on to others is what motivates @entity1 to continue staying in shape			1

inspiration is contagious and a continuous cycle			0

consistency is the key to both weight loss and fitness			1
you may not see results immediately , but keep at it and you will be rewarded			0
