she was 32 , and he was 41			0
" it seemed as if everyone we knew was already married , or had been married before			2
just when we thought that we had kissed every frog left in the universe and given up on true love , we met			0
" it 's a fairy tale scene that 's been witnessed at thousands of weddings since @entity28 ' recording of the classic , romantic song " @entity31 " was released in 1961			1
and though @entity28 died on january 20 at age 73 , her legacy lives on in couples around the world			1

' at last ' seemed like a song that was meant to be , just like our intertwining fates			2
" @entity63 had n't heard the song before the couple had to choose a piece for their first dance as husband and wife , but " was taken by its emotional character and lyrics			2
little did i know it was such a popular wedding song , and rightfully so , " he said			1

it was one of my favorite songs , " she said			0
" it 's so soulful and tells exactly how i feel about the relationship with my husband			0
... no one could reproduce the feeling that @entity6 conveys when she sings it			1
" " @entity31 " was the soundtrack to @entity123 and @entity125 's engagement and wedding , so of course they had to go see @entity28 live when she performed in their city of @entity132 , @entity133 , in 2007			1
" we could n't wait to go see her sing our song live on stage , " @entity123 wrote			0
" she was in her late sixties at the time , but wow -- what an entertainer she was ! i was pregnant with our second child when we saw her , but that did n't stop me from enjoying the concert like a teenager ! " another couple had a different kind of message in mind when they chose " @entity31 " for their wedding			1
@entity152 married her husband , @entity153 , in september 2009			0
the @entity155 , @entity105 , couple chose the song because it seemed to describe their relationship -- and to honor president @entity159			2
" the song also signified the inauguration of the first @entity65 president , " @entity152 said			0
" we were both big supporters of president @entity159 and his campaign and excitedly watched several inauguration balls where the song played prominently			0
" she remembers staying up all night watching the president and first lady @entity169 dance the night away at the inaugural balls			0
" when we chose the song , we had the first family in mind			2
" and for @entity175 , " @entity31 " was always her wedding song			1
she knew from the time she was 10 years old that it would be played at her wedding			0
" my mom would play this song , as a record , when i was a little girl and i thought it was so romantic , " said the @entity181 , @entity182 , resident			0
" i would listen to it and piece together all the traits and things that would make the perfect husband			0
i 've always known that ' at last ' would be the song i 'd want to use as my wedding song with my husband			1
