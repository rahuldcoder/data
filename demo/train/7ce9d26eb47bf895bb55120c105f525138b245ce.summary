@entity0 -- the @entity3 hospital where a nurse apparently committed suicide after being duped by a hoax call over prince @entity8 's pregnant wife condemned the radio station responsible in a strongly worded letter on saturday			1
two djs from @entity13 radio station @entity12 , impersonating @entity14 and prince @entity15 , called the hospital tuesday and gained information about the condition of @entity18 -- which they subsequently played on air			1
on friday , the nurse who transferred the call through to the ward , @entity23 , was found dead			1
" @entity26 's @entity25 cares for sick people , and it was extremely foolish of your presenters even to consider trying to lie their way through to one of our patients , let alone actually make the call , " wrote hospital chairman @entity24			1
management 's decision then to broadcast the recorded call " was truly appalling , " said @entity24 in the letter addressed to @entity36 , chairman of @entity37 , which owns the radio station			1
" the immediate consequence of these premeditated and ill - considered actions was the humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses who were simply doing their job tending to their patients			0
" the longer term consequence has been reported around the world and is , frankly , tragic beyond words			0
" lord @entity24 called on the radio station to take steps " to ensure that such an incident could never be repeated			1
" the fallout from @entity57 's death has stretched from @entity3 to @entity13 -- with questions being raised about how far is too far in the effort to find out details about @entity18 's pregnancy			1
the two @entity13 djs behind the practical joke , @entity64 and @entity65 , have come under fire , with some using the phrase " blood on your hands " to condemn their actions on the @entity71 - based radio station			1
" @entity82 , " screamed the front - page of the @entity3 's @entity75 on saturday , while @entity77 columnist @entity76 said it was " not so funny to hear two grown adults call up a hospital ward full of sick people to try to scam information about one of them			1
" read more : nurse 's death casts glare on ' shock jocks ' the djs have since apologized , and " mutually decided " to go off the air for an undetermined period , @entity86 , ceo of the @entity37 media group , said saturday during a news conference			1
but he defended the legality of the station 's action , saying he was " very confident that we have n't done anything illegal			1
" " this is a tragic event that could not have been reasonably foreseen , and we are deeply saddened by it , " he said			0
the @entity100 , the country 's media regulator , has not yet commented on the case			1

news of @entity57 's death broke friday , with the hospital saying she " was recently the victim of a hoax call			1

" throughout the controversy surrounding the hoax , authorities did not identify the nurse			2
her identity was released after her death			0
audio of the call posted online suggests a woman spoke briefly to the djs before she put the call through early tuesday morning to the ward where the @entity18 was being treated for acute morning sickness			1
" they were the world 's worst accents ever			0
we were sure 100 people at least before us would 've tried the same thing			0
... we were expecting to be hung up on			0
we did n't even know what to say when we got through , " @entity64 told listeners thursday			2
off the air , @entity64 and @entity154 tweeted about the practical joke on thursday and earlier friday , promising " more on the # royalprank			1
" the pair 's @entity159 accounts were taken down late friday			0
some listeners applauded the prank , like one who identified himself as @entity164 on the station 's @entity166 page and wrote , " it is only a joke people ! it was great i love it ! ! ! " others were outraged , with such negative comments outnumbering positive ones on @entity12 's facebook page before the nurse 's death			1
" your stunt was done at a time in this country where there is paranoia about the intrusion of the media into people 's lives , " @entity177 wrote			2
" i know you will say it is harmless fun , the management of @entity12 will say that it wo n't happen again , but this is exactly where the phone hacking scandal started			2
" the outcry grew exponentially after the hospital confirmed @entity57 's death , leading the @entity195 supermarket chain to remove all its advertising from @entity12			1
" this death is on your conscience , " reads one @entity166 post			0
several accused the two of having " blood on your hands			0
" @entity57 's family released a statement asking for privacy and directing questions to police			0
she is survived by her husband and two children			0
" we as a family are deeply saddened by the loss of our beloved @entity215 , " said the statement , released by police			0

the hospital " had been supporting her throughout this difficult time , " it said			0
a @entity224 spokesman said : " the @entity225 and @entity18 are deeply saddened to learn of the death			2
" @entity227 were looked after so wonderfully well at all times by everybody at @entity217 , and their thoughts and prayers are with @entity23 's family , friends and colleagues at this very sad time			1
" separately , a palace spokesman told @entity1 : " at no point did the palace complain to the hospital about the incident			0
on the contrary , we offered our full and heartfelt support to the nurses involved and hospital staff at all times			0
" the hospital said wednesday that it deeply regretted the call had been put through			2
