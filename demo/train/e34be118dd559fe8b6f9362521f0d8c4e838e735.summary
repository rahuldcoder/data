-- call it a bigger , bolder version of the deadline - driven congressional stalemates over taxes and spending that have come to define @entity8 dysfunction of the past two years			1
the latest edition of political " blinksmanship " pits president @entity10 and @entity11 against speaker @entity12 and @entity13 on how to avoid the fiscal cliff -- automatic tax increases for everyone and deep spending cuts including for the military that will be triggered in the new year without an agreement			1
while the focus now is on a possible agreement in coming days or weeks , anti-tax crusader @entity20 told @entity0 on monday that the nation should gird for long - range battle			0
" this is a long fight			0
it 's four years of a fight			0
it 's not one week of a fight , " said @entity20 , who has threatened to mount primary challenges against republicans who violate a pledge they signed at his behest against ever voting for a tax increase			0
financial planners : how to survive fiscal cliff with neither side showing any sign of blinking , however , the battlefield will probably shift to the @entity42 this week after @entity13 disarray in the @entity44 stymied any progress before @entity46			1
@entity47 and the president are taking a holiday break , with plans to return to work thursday to try to find a deal in the final five days of the year			2
economists warn that failing to avoid the fiscal cliff could spark recession , and stocks opened lower monday amid no sign of the @entity8 impasse ending			1
according to multiple @entity61 and @entity13 sources , no weekend conversations occurred between the @entity44 and @entity42 leaders from either party or their aides			1
the main dispute continues to be over taxes , specifically the demand by @entity10 and @entity11 to extend most of the tax cuts passed under president @entity69 while allowing higher rates of the 1990s to return on top income brackets			1
@entity13 oppose any kind of increase in tax rates , and @entity12 suffered the political indignity last week of offering a compromise that his colleagues refused to support			2
while both sides say they want to avoid the fiscal cliff , signs are emerging that a deal would come after the new year to blunt the harshest impacts			1
under that scenario , legislators would vote to lower taxes from the higher rates that will go into effect in january when the @entity69 cuts expire , with the new top rates staying intact			0
the sources described to @entity0 three possible options for moving ahead , all resting with senate majority leader @entity92 of @entity93			0
one would be to amend a @entity44 measure passed in july that extends the @entity69 tax cuts for everyone			0
the changes would return to higher rates on top brackets , which @entity10 defines as family income up to $ 250,000 , and also could include the president 's call to extend unemployment benefits and some of the fiscal cliff spending cuts			1

it calls for the @entity10 plan of extending the current tax cuts on family income up to $ 250,000			1
however , the @entity42 version has a constitutional problem because by law , measures that raise revenue must originate in the @entity44			0
@entity12 said friday that the @entity42 plan has a " blue slip " problem , which refers to an objection that it is unconstitutional and therefore remains lodged in the @entity42			2
while one @entity61 source said the @entity42 version could get taken up in the @entity44 if senate minority leader @entity128 or @entity12 do n't raise a blue - slip objection , @entity13 sources rejected that scenario			1
@entity92 also could take a different revenue - raising bill from the @entity44 and rewrite it as a tax and spending measure to address fiscal cliff issues , the sources explained			1
with @entity13 holding filibuster power in the @entity61 - majority @entity42 , at least seven @entity13 senators would have to join @entity11 on such a plan before the end of the year			1
with @entity144 up for re-election in 2014 , he is considered unlikely to risk angering the party 's conservative base by supporting a compromise or allowing one to pass on a simple majority vote that would need no @entity13 backing , sources said			2
in the new @entity42 that will convene in early january , the number of @entity13 needed to pass a deal would be five because of @entity61 gains in november , when @entity10 won re-election			1
according to a senior administration official , the president is still holding to his promise not to sign a short - term bill that extends bush - era tax cuts across the board to buy time for a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff			1
so , absent a deal that includes increasing income - tax rates for wealthy @entity164 , the country is still headed for the cliff			2
but the administration official told @entity0 it 's still possible to resolve the impasse : " the unanimous desire to avoid the fiscal cliff will hopefully animate everybody , " the official said			1
according to a @entity42 @entity13 leadership aide , @entity13 reject @entity10 's $ 250,000 threshold for tax cut extensions			1
meanwhile , a @entity42 @entity61 leadership aide lamented @entity144 's apparent unwillingness to negotiate			2
" we 're going to be here @entity181 , " retiring sen. @entity182 said sunday on @entity0 's " @entity177 , " adding that it was likely the nation would go over the fiscal cliff			1
failing to meet the year - end deadline on striking a deal would amount to " the most colossal , consequential act of congressional irresponsibility in a long time , " said @entity182 , an independent from @entity188 who caucuses with @entity11			1
" maybe ever in @entity164 history , because of the impact it will have on almost every @entity164			0
" however , @entity20 called the situation part of a longer process			0
" this is not a fight that begins and ends the first week of january , " he said , predicting " a regular fight " when @entity47 needs to authorize more government spending and raise the federal debt ceiling in coming months			0
" there the @entity199 have a lot of clout because they can say we 'll let you run the government for the next month , but you 've got to make these reforms , " he explained			0
how might the " fiscal cliff " affect you ? @entity10 spoke separately friday with @entity12 and @entity92 to try to salvage a fiscal cliff deal by the end of year , then delivered a previously unscheduled statement to reporters at the @entity44			1
he acknowledged what has become obvious : the broader deficit reduction deal he seeks will probably come in stages , rather than in the so - called grand bargain he and @entity12 have been trying to negotiate			0
in particular , @entity10 called for @entity47 to come back after @entity46 and work with him on a limited agreement to prevent tax hikes on the middle class , extend unemployment insurance and set a framework for future deficit reduction steps			0
@entity12 's spokesman said the speaker will be " ready to find a solution that can pass both houses of @entity47 " when he returns to @entity8 , as now planned for thursday			0
the @entity13 opposition to any kind of tax rate increase has stalled deficit negotiations for two years and led to unusual political drama , such as @entity144 recently filibustering a proposal he introduced and thursday night 's rebuff by @entity199 of an alternative tax plan pushed by @entity12 , their leader			1
@entity12 said at a news conference friday that his @entity13 colleagues refused to back his plan , which would have extended all tax cuts except for income of more than $ 1 million , because of fears of being blamed for a tax increase			2
the negotiations with @entity10 on a broad deficit reduction agreement hit an impasse last week when both sides offered their " bottom line " positions , @entity12 said			0
in what was considered as progress just a week ago , the president and speaker made major concessions but remained a few hundred billion dollars apart			0
@entity92 and other @entity11 say @entity44 @entity13 must accept that agreement will require support from legislators in both parties			2
he insisted that the @entity42 - passed plan with @entity10 's $ 250,000 threshold , which polls show is strongly supported by the public , would pass the @entity44 if @entity12 would allow a vote			1
some @entity44 @entity13 have said they would join @entity11 in supporting the president 's proposal in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on the spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek			1
the possibility of a fiscal cliff was set in motion over the past two years as a way to force action on mounting government debt			2
now , legislators risk looking politically cynical by seeking to weaken the measures enacted to try to force them to confront tough questions regarding deficit reduction , such as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as @entity283 , @entity284 and @entity285			0
polling has consistently shown most @entity164 back the president , who insists wealthy @entity164 must pay more , rather than @entity12 and his @entity13 colleagues , who have balked at tax rate hikes and demanded spending cuts and entitlement program reforms			2
a new @entity0 / @entity293 survey last week found that just over half of respondents believe @entity13 should give up more in any solution and consider the party 's policies too extreme			0
the two sides seemingly had made progress early last week on forging a $ 2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by @entity10 and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by @entity12			0
the president 's latest offer set $ 400,000 as the income threshold for a tax rate increase , up from his original plan of $ 250,000			2
it also included a new formula for the consumer price index applied to some entitlement benefits , much to the chagrin of liberals			0
called chained @entity316 , the new formula includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices , such as seeking cheaper alternatives , and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years			0
statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean @entity283 recipients would get $ 6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained @entity316			0
liberal groups sought to mount a pressure campaign against including the chained @entity316 after news emerged this week that @entity10 was willing to include it , calling the plan a betrayal of senior citizens who had contributed throughout their lives for their benefits			2
@entity0 's @entity337 in @entity338 and @entity339 in @entity8 reported this story , which was written by @entity341 in @entity8 .			0

who will blink first in @entity8 's fiscal cliff *showdown* ?
without a deal , everyone 's taxes go up next year
@entity42 @entity13 reject a tax plan already passed by @entity11
