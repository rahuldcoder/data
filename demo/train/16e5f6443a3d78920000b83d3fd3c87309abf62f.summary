@entity0 -- in the enclaves of @entity5 , @entity6 , the political and ideological dividing line is a highway			2
on one side of @entity9 is @entity10 , a wealthy community designed to look like an @entity13 village			2
it is home to a historic country club and its residents are 75 % @entity18 , according to an analysis by the @entity20			0
on the other side of the highway is @entity23 , a community that prides itself on its urban chic shops and restaurants			0
it held a craft beer festival this past weekend and its residents are 75 % @entity29			0
" clearly one side of the city of @entity5 is very old money and conservative and on the other side of the street , it 's a very progressive college community , " said @entity30 , @entity32 @entity31 editor for the @entity20			1
" this is a fairly recent development			0
we 've never seen this type of polarization on a neighborhood level to such a degree and it 's only increasing			1
" the growth in the number of @entity32 who sort themselves into communities like @entity10 or @entity23 , consistently express either liberal or conservative views and the disappearing overlap between those two groups illustrates why the country â € ” and the @entity53 -- is so divided , according to a new study by the @entity55			1
" voters are plenty to blame for the current predicament they complain about , " @entity56 said			0
" people want to live next to others who share their political and cultural values			0
it makes it easier for politicians to gerrymander because voters are already presorted			0
" and that type of redistricting means a more hyper - partisan class of voters is more likely to send like - minded , hyper - partisan lawmakers to @entity0 to represent them , political analysts said			1
it 's your fault : how our ' tribes ' help create gridlock in @entity53 the @entity55 report found that increasingly , the most politically active and engaged @entity32 are opting to live in " ideological silos , " communities peopled with like - minded individuals who passionately hold on to partisan views and eschew those whose opinions differ			1
among the report 's findings : why does this matter ? because , as the report points out , over the past 20 years , " partisan animosity has increased substantially " â € ” more than doubling , in fact			1
the most politically engaged @entity32 are most likely to see only the rightness of their own positions and view the opposing sides ideas as " so misguided that they threaten the nation 's well - being			1
" meanwhile , the majority of @entity32 , those who hold more centrist views , are content to sit on the sidelines , staying out of the political fray , the @entity55 report found			1
this is a recipe for legislative gridlock , political demographers and analysts said			1
@entity106 : partisanship is a @entity109 principle think of it as a ripple effect , @entity112 , co-author of " @entity114 : why the @entity115 is tearing us apart , " told @entity1 last year			2
" like - minded groups , over time , become more extreme in how they 're like - minded , " he said			2
this means in order to be considered a " good @entity29 " or " good @entity18 " citizens , and the lawmakers who represent them , are pressured to think and vote only in a certain , partisan way , political demographers and analysts have found			1
and woe the person who votes against the group - think			2
take for example , @entity128 house majority leader @entity128 , whose 7th @entity129 includes @entity10			0
his opponent , @entity130 , a political newcomer and economics professor was able to use @entity128 's openness to considering a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants as an example of how the veteran lawmaker was out of touch with his conservative base			0
@entity128 lost the @entity18 primary on tuesday by double digits			0
down but not done : @entity128 's loss not end for immigration reform @entity128 had been " taking conservative position after conservative position after conservative position , but almost 100 % was n't enough for these folks , " @entity1 political analyst @entity145 said .			0

politically engaged @entity32 are increasingly partisan , according to a new @entity55 poll
hyper - partisanship at the local level eventually leads to hyper - partisanship in @entity53 , **experts** say
those who trend more moderate are also less likely to be politically - engaged , the @entity55 poll found
all of these factors have create gridlock on the @entity53 level , **experts** say
