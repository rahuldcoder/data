a @entity1 reservist says he accidentally drove his truck across the @entity4 border into @entity5 , @entity6 , where he was arrested and charged with possession of three firearms and ammunition			1
all of the guns were legally registered in the @entity4			1
surprisingly , however , in @entity12 , firearm possession is almost completely outlawed			0
sgt. @entity13 , a decorated @entity1 who served two tours in @entity15 , had a shotgun , a handgun and a rifle -- all illegal in @entity6			1
he also had 400 pieces of ammunition			0
he is being held on weapons charges in a prison outside a town near @entity5			1
i can imagine what some people might be thinking upon hearing this news			0
wait -- @entity6 has strict gun control laws ? and anyone from the @entity30 , or anyone who has ever been to @entity5 , might have followed that up with : wait -- @entity5 has laws ? after all , many 19 - year - old @entity4 go to @entity5 specifically because of the border town 's legendary , shall we say , " relaxed " legal approach to minimum drinking ages and competitively priced prostitutes			1
but it 's true : although the @entity6 @entity42 is similar to the @entity42 in that it guarantees some right to arms , @entity6 's statutory ownership and permit laws have essentially regulated this " right " into a theoretical one			2
that 's right , @entity6 is actually tough on guns			1
the controlling law is @entity50 ( @entity51 ) , or the @entity52			0
( for a terrific translation of the text into @entity55 , as well as an academic analysis of @entity6 gun laws , check out @entity58 's @entity6 's @entity59 for the @entity4 ? ) the short version : @entity13 , who has been held more than two months , faces some serious penalties for the firearms in his truck			1
even possessing ammunition without prior authorization is prohibited in @entity6 by federal law , with penalties of up to 30 years in prison			1
@entity6 's message is clear : firearms ? no bueno			2
the incident has triggered a groundswell of support for the sergeant in the @entity4			2
this raises an interesting issue , however			0
if @entity13 was n't such a sympathetic figure , in fact , if he was anything other than a war hero , many of us might be asking different questions			2
questions such as : who accidentally drives into @entity6 with a truck full of firearms ? because if you strip away the good character , the remaining facts are not so good for @entity13 , especially from a criminal defense perspective			1
a @entity6 prosecutor could focus on the basic facts : first , @entity13 drove his car across the border into @entity6 ; second , with firearms and ammunition in his truck			1
in @entity6 , that 's a clearly defined crime			2
on the defense side , it 's been widely reported how easy it is to accidentally drive into @entity6 at the @entity104 border crossing			2
this could help negate his intent			0
then there 's the issue of @entity111 's war - related conditions , which may have contributed to his unfortunate choice of highway ramps			0
@entity13 suffered a severe concussion when a homemade bomb seriously damaged his vehicle in @entity15			0
his mother has said he suffers from " directional dysfunctionality , " which means he frequently gets lost , as well as post-traumatic stress disorder , depression and hypervigilance -- conditions acquired during , and because of his service			0
and more to his credit , this @entity1 did make law - abiding decisions : his firearms were lawfully registered in the @entity4 , and he immediately called 911 from his cell phone for guidance when he 'd realized his mistake			1
this country has rallied around @entity111 because he 's exactly the kind of figure @entity4 rallies around : a good person caught in a bad situation			2
but what if this happened to someone else ? what if this were just a trust - fund frat boy on spring break , who took a wrong turn in his parents ' @entity144 with an @entity146 in the passenger seat ? would there be the same outpouring of sympathy , if other facts remained the same ? apply the same facts to the fictional spring - breaker above , or one of the @entity155 guys , or -- dare i say it -- @entity158			0
do you think most of @entity4 would be so mobilized ? whether we admit it or not , the level of popular support is often driven by the character of the person involved , and not the underlying facts			1
if " @entity167 " had made this wrong turn , we 'd be saying good riddance -- and we would n't care what his mental health status was at all			0
do n't get me wrong : if i were president , i 'd have already sent in @entity174 helicopters to extract @entity111 -- but mercifully for the @entity4 , i 'm not the president			1
he even attempted a prison escape			0
of course , attorneys are ethically forbidden to counsel a crime like a prison escape , but i 'm pretty sure we can silently root for one â€” especially when it 's in a foreign jurisdiction			0
@entity6 should be equally praised and criticized for its gun control legislation			1
in theory , as written , the statute attempts to restrict gun ownership to only the most responsible owners , or the most necessary purposes			0
in practice , however , we all know @entity6 is hardly a gun - free , crime - free utopia			1
@entity13 is a responsible gun owner whose ownership did not comply with @entity6 law			1
now , his freedom depends on three factors , unrelated to the facts : first , the @entity6 government can choose not to prosecute			1
prosecutors in the @entity4 have discretion to withdraw prosecution in the interest of justice			0
i hope their @entity6 counterparts have similar interests : to secure justice rather than victory			0
second , @entity4 political pressure may help to secure his release			2
but if @entity13 benefits from either of these , it will be because of his good character and not the underlying facts			0
the underlying facts here are bad for this defendant			0
of course , the third option is a safe escape from a @entity6 jail ... but i did n't actually recommend that .			2

a @entity1 is in prison after driving into @entity5 with guns in his truck , illegal in @entity6
@entity230 : penalties severe for entering @entity6 illegally and breaking its gun law
@entity230 : many are rooting for him : would they if he were n't a sympathetic character ?
@entity230 : maybe @entity6 wo n't prosecute , or @entity4 pressure will get him released
