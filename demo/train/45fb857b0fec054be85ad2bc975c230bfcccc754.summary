-- @entity2 's reason for returning to tv in @entity5 's " extant " are simple : she goes " where the work is , " as she told the network			1
and lately -- especially amid the rise of streaming original series and creatively compelling cable dramas -- an actress looking for strong material looks to tv just as often as she looks to the silver screen			1
in the past , an @entity17 winner trading in a movie script for something airing on a broadcast network might have signaled a dwindling career			2
now , " the lines are blurring , " @entity22 said			1
" i have never looked at tv as a negative			2
as i was doing well in my movie career , i always came back to do television movies			2
i go where the work is			2
i go where the characters are			0
and i 'm happy that other people are starting to do the same thing			0
" " @entity4 , " created by @entity37 and executive produced by @entity39 , is set in the near future and stars @entity22 as @entity34 , an astronaut who 's returning home after a 13 - month solo mission			1
as @entity34 tries to readjust to her terrestrial family -- which includes a husband ( @entity43 ) and an android son ( @entity44 ) -- she 's hit with the news that she 's somehow pregnant			0
( in case you were wondering , @entity39 says he " read the script long before i knew about [ 2013 's ] ' gravity ' or had ever seen ' gravity			0
' " ) already picked up for 13 episodes , " extant " sets itself up to ponder how @entity34 got pregnant if she was on a mission by herself , especially with a history of fertility issues			0
" you find out but slowly , " @entity22 told @entity5			1
" it 's very mysterious , it 's very suspenseful , and there are many twists and turns along the way getting to that resolve			0
" after viewing the pilot episode , critics are cautiously optimistic			1
( many , it seems , still have bitter feelings toward @entity5 for the bait - and - switch of " @entity68			1
" ) " a movie star has descended to television -- network television no less -- and she is not putting on airs , " says @entity70 's @entity69			0
" ' extant ' ... tosses sci - fi films from ' 2001 ' to ' @entity76 ' to ' @entity77 ' in a blender , and serves up a psychologically minded speculative smoothie , complete with impregnating aliens , emotional robots , and vast conspiracies			0
no one element of this show feels original , and yet i would totally watch more , even if just to peep at the sleek futuristic garbage cans again			0
" variety too thought that " @entity4 " " feels a bit like a @entity39 greatest ( and not - so - greatest ) hits album " but does n't view that as " an indictment so much as a road map to this @entity5 summer drama			1
... it 's certainly an intriguing launch ; but then again , so was ' @entity68 ' before that narratively ran into a brick wall			0
" @entity97 's @entity96 found " a genuine sense of tension to the first episode , " adding that " it feels like the characters live in a fully - realized science fiction world			2
... @entity22 provides ( pardon the pun ) enough gravity to make ' @entity4 ' feel like a genuine work of science fiction , rather than a soap opera dressed up in sci - fi drag , which happens too often on the broadcast networks			1
it 's a good start , at least			0
" not everyone sees " @entity4 's " potential			1
the @entity115 ' @entity114 thinks " the creators deserve credit for trying to revive this kind of classic science - fiction mystery , " yet she found that " the premiere , while entertaining and expertly produced , does n't hold out a lot of promise			2
" for @entity125 's @entity124 , @entity22 herself is " @entity4 's " trump card			1
" she brings a dignity and gravity to @entity34 , a projected intelligence that allows you to buy her as an astronaut and to see what has happened to her as frightening rather than ridiculous , " @entity124 observes			0
" @entity22 's all in , and you float along			0
... ( @entity136 ) et 's hope ' @entity4 ' does n't let her , and us , down			1
" @entity5 's hour - long " extant " premieres at 9 p.m. et / @entity140 today			1
@entity141 joins ' @entity142 ' ' @entity143 ' will take place before , during and after ' @entity145 ' ' community ' gets new life on @entity148			0
