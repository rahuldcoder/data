-- if you 're looking to upgrade your car this year , you can ignore fuel injection , turbo charging , power steering and a streamlined chassis -- the new breakthrough that will improve your ride is an @entity9			1
ok , it might be a slight exaggeration to say @entity13 's much - vaunted tablet computer is helping re-shape the motor industry , but as manufacturers try to cram more technology into vehicles , they are looking at devices like the @entity9 to help them			1
while the dashboards of many cars of today are groaning with gizmos such as satellite navigation , dvd players and mp3 interfaces alongside traditional odometers , tomorrow 's vehicles are likely to replace the lot with a single computer			1
this year 's @entity31 saw several new vehicles integrating the @entity9 into their dashboards , most notably @entity35 's classic campervan update , the electric - powered @entity37 microbus , and the @entity38 produced by @entity40 manufacturer @entity39			1
@entity42 gallery : hot cars of the @entity31 the @entity9 installation is part of a wider industry trend to fit @entity48 - connected computers into vehicles , a move that offers seemingly limitless opportunities for hauling the automobile into the digital age			1
but in the race to hook drivers up to the @entity57 , there are concerns that the impact these distractions will have on safety are being overlooked			0
and , as rising fuel prices hike the cost of motoring , will such technology be jettisoned to save cash ? the good news for gadget freaks is that computers are here to stay , says @entity70 , of @entity71 -- a leading developer of in - car telematics ( devices that send and receive information )			1
they not only appeal to buyers , he says , but also ensure efficiency			0
" people want entertainment options and they want to be able to take what they 're getting on other devices , whether its their laptop or @entity9 or @entity84 or smart phone , into the car , " @entity70 said			1
" and that certainly is a powerful driver for the market			0
" with an internet connection , he says , comes the option not only to monitor performance or control certain vehicle functions from a remote desktop , but also to outsource functions like satellite navigation or entertainment to another computer			2
" we 're looking at more offboard solutions ; using connectivity into the vehicle to download offboard entertainment instead of trying to jam it into the central stack			2
you shed weight out of the vehicle which adds to fuel efficiency			2
" while vehicle manufacturers are starting to experiment with internet connectivity , full deployment is dependent on the advent of so - called fourth generation -- or @entity115 -- wireless networks that will permit the data transfer speeds needed by moving vehicles			1
these networks -- offering downloads up to 10 times faster than 3g systems used by the latest smartphones -- are expected to start rolling out later this year in the @entity123			0
some @entity125 countries such as @entity126 have already begun limited trials			0
but what about the safety issue ? do in - car computers mean drivers will be too busy poking their friend on @entity133 to pay attention to the road ? @entity136 , a research scientist at the independent @entity137 in @entity138 , says that although vehicle manufacturers take safety very seriously , gadget - thirsty consumers are less conscious of the risks			1
" there is certainly an eagerness to bring technology into vehicles because it is something consumers are now looking for -- something like @entity84 connectors are more important than another air bag , " he said			2
says @entity136 , the danger is not so much from equipment fitted by manufacturers , but " after - market " or " nomadic " devices -- such as cellphones or navigation systems -- bought separately and installed by drivers			2
for vehicles using @entity9 or computers running @entity162 's @entity161 software , this could include apps downloaded without manufacturer 's approval that distract drivers away from the task at hand			1
" the point of these internet devices are they are very attractive , they pull you in and they 're not designed to be tasks that can be easily chunked in half - second glances , " says @entity136			0
" it 's partly physical , not looking in the right place , and its partly mental not having enough spare capacity to deal with the unexpected situations			0
" that said , many technological innovations coming onto the market are concerned with improving vehicle safety			0
not least voice - activated functions being developed by several automakers including @entity186 , which debuted its " sync " system at @entity31			1
there 's more to come , according to @entity70 , with cars being developed that can notify insurers as soon as they are involved in accidents , saving money by speeding up the claims process			0
systems are also being developed by @entity197 and @entity198 that can alert emergency services , assessing how severe a crash is			0
these could even be integrated with electronic medical records			0
but even as technology marches on , not all is here to stay			0
@entity70 says some gadgets , like devices showing real - time traffic data , can fall out of favor			2
and , like so many tape decks , eight - track cartridges and in - car record players ( which briefly existed in the 1950s ) before it , the @entity9 could soon be driving off into the sunset .			1

new vehicles *displayed* at @entity31 have @entity9 incorporated into design
industry experts say @entity48 - enabled computers will replace traditional vehicle gadgets
on - board computers likely to be able to dial *911* after *collisions*
