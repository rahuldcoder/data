-- @entity1 released @entity2 to developers last week , a new operating system that will make your desktop computer work more like your phone than ever before			1
the trend is clear : the desktop operating system will merge with the mobile os in the coming years			1
the question is : why ? let 's start with the trend itself			0
first off , @entity1 is integrating cloud services much more deeply in @entity2 than any previous operating system			0
that means your music , photos , calendars , contacts , emails and more can now stay in sync across your phone , tablet and @entity27 @entity1 has also unified your messages across your devices : the message app ( formerly @entity31 ) will replace @entity32 on the @entity27 that 's not all : @entity2 also gets a notification center that works just like the notifications you receive on your phone			1
@entity39 is coming to the @entity27 as well , allowing you to play games against your friends who own iphones and @entity44			2
apps like @entity46 are also all getting desktop versions -- and of course these sync with your mobile devices so your data is always up to date			2
most notable of all : @entity1 is now pushing software updates through the @entity54 , hinting that the @entity54 may become the only way to get software on your @entity27 in the future			2
so what are the advantages of your desktop computer merging with your phone 's functionality ? and are there any downsides ? simplicity the main reason @entity1 wants to make @entity27 work like the @entity69 and @entity44 is simple			1
despite decades of innovation and the invention of the graphical user interface , computers remain too confusing and complex for the majority of people			0
while more powerful software with complex functionality will continue to exist for highly technical users , most consumers want a device that 's easy to use and intuitive			0
the rise of the @entity44 and @entity69 prove that there 's huge demand for such simplicity , and that desktops too will need to become more streamlined			0
the downside of simplicity ? simple systems are often less " open " and provide less freedom to try new things : tasks are either easy to complete ( because the developers thought of that use case ) or not possible at all			1
security mobile operating systems could potentially be more secure than their desktop counterparts			1
in particular , if @entity1 makes the @entity54 the only way to download apps to your @entity27 , it would become more difficult for users to install malware ( since @entity1 manually approves every app in the store )			2
what 's more , mobile features like tracking the location of your devices or wiping them remotely will make consumer desktops more secure			0
there are downsides to app stores , however			0
not only would devices become less open -- the makers of operating systems become gatekeepers -- but you could argue that @entity1 and its rivals simply want to force the use of app stores so that they make more money for themselves			1
syncing perhaps the most obvious benefit of making desktops work more like phones is unity between all your devices			0
with a similar ( or single ) operating system on all your gadgets , syncing apps , contacts and calendars between them all becomes effortless			2
there 's a downside for users , however : competing operating systems tend not to work well together , and using one operating system across all devices means uses are " locked in " more than ever before			1
so there you have it : your desktop computer is becoming more and more like your phone -- and in fact the line between the two will one day disappear			0
if you think it 's just @entity1 's devices that are headed toward a simpler operating system , however , you 'd be mistaken -- @entity1 is merely in the news because @entity2 became available to developers last week			0
in fact , @entity159 's @entity158 takes its cues from @entity162 , meaning that the two major desktop operating systems will mimic your mobile devices very soon .			1

desktop operating systems will merge with mobile os in the coming years
music , photos , calendars and emails now sync across your phone , tablet and @entity27
but simple systems are often less " open " and provide less freedom to try new things
