-- president @entity1 and rival @entity2 have targeted @entity3 with incessant campaigning , a slew of television ads and nonstop political phone calls			1
the importance of the @entity3 can not be overstated : @entity3 has not voted for the loser in the presidential election since 1960			1
in other words , as goes @entity3 , so goes the nation			1
" they 're just going to badger voters over and over again until they cast a ballot , " said @entity13 , a political science professor at the @entity14			0
" it does n't really matter where they pick up the votes , so the campaigns are everywhere			0
they 're visiting all over the state and running ads everywhere			0
" @entity1 and vice president @entity26 have visited @entity3 10 times in the past 30 days , including a rally in @entity29 on tuesday			1
@entity2 and his running mate , @entity30 , have stumped 21 times			2
it is the second most - visited state on the campaign trail , behind only @entity34 , another swing state			0
the @entity1 campaign has flooded the @entity3 airwaves with $ 57 million in advertising ; @entity2 for president has spent $ 34 million -- anything to pick up the state 's vital 18 electoral votes			1
five things we learned from the final debate in fact , @entity13 said , all political ad space in the major tv markets has been purchased through the november 6 election			0
" @entity3 is ground zero for the jobs debate , " @entity50 strategist and @entity0 contributor @entity49 said			2
@entity49 , who was a top media adviser to the 2004 @entity56 - @entity55 re-election campaign and a @entity2 adviser in 2008 , said @entity3 is " a microcosm of @entity60 swing voters : @entity61 ; suburban soccer moms ; and even @entity63 , upwardly @entity64 , an increasingly important target for both parties			1
" if the campaigns needed any more ammo for their efforts , they got it on monday			0
the latest collection of polls in @entity3 shows a razor - thin margin separating the candidates			1
the @entity75 shows @entity1 at 48 % and @entity2 at 45 % in the @entity3			1
" it 's a very critical state , " @entity0 chief national correspondent @entity76 told @entity77 on monday			0
" right now , you have that slight lead for the president ; gov. @entity2 's team would say it 's a tie			2
" pundits say that @entity3 is a must - win state for @entity2 , that his chances for the necessary 270 electoral college votes become nearly impossible without carrying @entity3			1
" this is the big one , " @entity76 said			0
the @entity2 campaign also has focused on three typically @entity50 states that went for @entity1 in 2008 : @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			1
getting those three states , plus @entity3 , would be crucial in electing @entity2 as the nation 's next president			1
by contrast , @entity1 could win by picking up @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity3			1
" you could make an argument the president should just camp out right here in the @entity104 , " @entity76 said			0
at the center of it all is @entity3 , one of the nation 's great industrial states , with 11.5 million people			1
@entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 have traditionally voted @entity115 in support of the auto , steel and tire unions , while @entity120 and @entity121 have leaned @entity50			0
@entity1 carried @entity3 in 2008 52 % to 47 % over @entity122 , riding a wave of increased @entity125 voter turnout over 2004 and winning traditionally @entity50 areas			1
but whether @entity1 can rally his base in the same numbers remains one of the lingering questions this election season			1
campaign enters final stretch " it 's too close to call , " said @entity14 's @entity13			0
" the outcome is probably going to depend on turnout and how good of a job the campaigns do in getting out their faithful			0
" buoyed by polling that shows @entity1 enjoying a wide margin among female voters ( 53 % to 41 % ) , @entity26 stumped in @entity143 , @entity3 , on monday , chiding @entity2 for his " binders full of women " response when the @entity50 hopeful was asked at the last debate about pay inequities in the work force			1
" he started talking about binders			0
binders ? " @entity26 said			0
" whoa ! " @entity2 leads among men by a similar margin			1
the gap between @entity1 and @entity2 has narrowed in the past month			1
ahead of the first presidential debate , @entity1 enjoyed as much as a 10 percentage point advantage , and many political experts believed the election was virtually over			2
but then came @entity2 's october surge			2
" it 's very simple : once again , it 's all coming down to @entity3 , " said @entity161 , a senior fellow at the @entity162 and former policy adviser to @entity164			2
" i feel quite confident this time around that whoever wins @entity3 will be the next president of the @entity60 , and i very much suspect that the campaigns agree with that proposition			2
" @entity13 attributes @entity2 's comeback to three issues : â € ¢ the first presidential debate , which most people believed @entity2 won			2
â € ¢ the events in @entity175 that resulted in the deaths of four @entity60 , including ambassador @entity177			0
â € ¢ voters alienated by @entity1 who wanted to like @entity2			1
@entity3 newspapers ink their 2012 presidential picks " the first debate let people who were looking for reasons to support @entity2 and made them feel that he was of a presidential caliber , " @entity13 said			1
he said he is paying close attention to the blue - collar @entity125 areas in the northern part of the state , where race could play a factor in the voting			0
the auto bailout has played out well in @entity3 ( one in eight jobs is connected to the auto industry ) , and @entity13 said many blue - collar types would like to support @entity2 but have trouble relating to him because of his track record of shipping jobs overseas			1
" they just do n't resonate with @entity2 , " @entity13 said			1
" but they 're not heavily attracted to @entity1			2
" @entity1 and @entity26 have campaigned hard in @entity3 and @entity202 on @entity2 's opinion piece that said to let @entity204 go bankrupt , repeating the refrain " @entity206 is dead and @entity207 is alive			1
" a billboard in the @entity3 city of @entity210 , where @entity207 has a plant , carried that same message for four weeks , but not before stirring a swirl of emotions			2
" a lot of people here were offended by it , @entity50 and @entity61 alike , " said mayor @entity215 , a @entity115			0
" the message was just not a good message			0
" the @entity210 mayor said he hopes @entity60 " stop all the bickering " and " get behind our president , whoever it might be , and put all this behind us			0
" in a sign of voter enthusiasm , more than 1.4 million @entity227 have voted or requested an absentee ballot since early and absentee voting began on october 2			2
almost a third of @entity227 voted early in 2008 , in large numbers for @entity1			2
@entity50 say they 're better organized this time around and hope to make inroads there			0
one thing 's for sure , @entity13 said , @entity3 voters can expect more campaign stops by the candidates , more phone calls , more political mailings			0
" we 're pretty well - balanced between the two parties , " @entity13 said			0
" and that means both candidates are going to court @entity227 because both sides feel they can win			0
" six undecided voters in six swing states @entity0 's @entity249 and @entity250 contributed to this report .			0

as goes @entity3 , so goes the nation : @entity3 has n't voted for loser since 1960
@entity1 has spent $ 57 million in ads ; @entity2 has spent $ 34 million
latest @entity75 shows @entity1 with a razor - thin margin
professor says getting out the base will be *key*
