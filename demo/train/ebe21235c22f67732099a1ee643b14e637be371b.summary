the @entity24 -- whose program the boys were participating in -- claimed in a statement that four people were hurt in the attack			1
the mauling occurred around 8:30 p.m. saturday as the teenagers were crossing a creek in a remote area about 45 miles northeast of @entity35			2
there were no instructors with the group , which was on the 24th of a 30 - day backpacking course to learn about teamwork and wilderness - related skills , according to the @entity44 - based program			1

" they were mauled , very severely , " said @entity17			1
" it was truly an emergency situation			0
" between ages 16 to 18 and from all around the country , the boys said that they followed protocol in calling out to warn the bears and carrying bear spray , according to the wilderness program			2
afterward , the group set up a camp , provided first aid and activated a personal locator beacon , which is used to alert authorities about one 's whereabouts in an emergency			1
a helicopter was then dispatched , tracking the beacon 's signal and finding the teens in a tent around 2:45 a.m. sunday , said state troopers			1
the rescuers then determined that two of the victims were too hurt to be safely transported by the helicopter for medical aid			2
a state trooper stayed on the scene , helping tend to those two as well as a third boy who was in the best condition , while the others were flown out for treatment at @entity87 in @entity88			1

" seven other @entity24 students , as well as three instructors , had been in the @entity7 wilderness at the time of the attack and were unaware of the mauling , the state police said			1
the outdoor leadership school said these 10 people have since been located and " are in the process of being evacuated by helicopter			0
" in mid-july , wildlife officials in @entity113 said they killed a black bear who they believed had wandered into a heavily populated campsite and attacked a teenage boy			0

a man was killed weeks earlier in a grizzly bear attack in @entity44 's @entity125			0
