@entity0 , @entity1 -- father @entity3 keeps hundreds of cards and letters from the passengers and crew members who survived the wreck of the @entity10 cruise liner on a shelf in the rectory of the brick - faced @entity13 , just up the narrow street from the island 's only port			1
many of the letters , handwritten in @entity20 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , are addressed simply to " @entity0 , @entity1 58012 " to no one in particular , almost as if the island itself is a person			1
the writers express gratitude for assistance they received or apologize for the wreck 's impact on @entity0			1
when the postal carrier brings the mail over on the morning ferry from the @entity19 mainland , he either leaves the new letters with mayor @entity36 or at the church with father @entity3			0
after all , @entity0 has always been the type of place where the mailman knows exactly who is around and who is not			1
interactive : how the 952 - foot wreck will be raised at least that 's the way it used to be before the @entity10 ran aground off @entity0 on january 13 , 2012 , killing 32 passengers and injuring dozens more			1
but in the last year since the salvage operation began at full tilt , the island has shifted from being a secluded utopia that attracted mainly birdwatchers hoping to spot @entity54 seagulls , kestrals and goldcrests , or hikers who wanted to climb its solitary slopes , to what it is now : the epicenter of the largest - ever maritime salvage operation in the world			2
the island has a winter population of around 1,000 people spread between the port , the village of @entity70 on top of the island 's hill , and the seaside village of @entity75 on the other side			1
the population swells considerably during the summer months when hotels and seaside resorts are brimming with sun seekers			0
but now @entity0 's permanent population has been bolstered by a constant crew of at least 500 @entity85 and @entity86 workers from 21 nations who have , in many ways , invaded paradise			1
many live offshore in a floating dormitory called the @entity92 , but they all make their way to the island on a regular basis			2
a scant few of the new @entity99 , as the island 's inhabitants are called , are pale engineers , who , despite being on a sunny island for more than a year , still have n't managed a tan			1
they spend their time in simulated control rooms behind computer screens , working out every potential obstacle in tipping the massive cruise liner , which ran aground off the island in january 2012 , to an upright position			1
one such worker is @entity112 , a @entity113 engineer who will be one of the eight people in the control room when the @entity10 is rotated upright in a delicate procedure called " parbuckling " that is scheduled to take place september 16			1
he lives in an apartment in the port and not on the @entity92 , but he still has seen very little of the island			1
that 's not why he 's here			2
" i am here for a job , " @entity112 told @entity2 inside a simulated control room attached to the @entity124 next to @entity3 's church			2
" i know a lot of people on the team who socialize in town , but i am here to concentrate on this job			2
" the rest of the temporary crew are mostly contracted shift workers who learned their perilous trade in places like west @entity140 and the @entity142 midlands			1
salvage jobs are a natural leap for skilled deep - sea drillers and rig constructors looking for lucrative seasonal work , and many of them have taken up with the local girls , completely transforming the social scene at the port			1
on any given night of the week , the portside bars are filled with men in gray @entity85 jumpsuits			0
an occasional salvage woman joins the mix , but the vast majority are men who come in to port to unwind			2
some wear holsters with scissors hanging on them -- a cowboy-esque equivalent of a pistol for deep sea oilrig divers			0
others sling their red inflatable @entity86 life vests over their shoulders or dangle them on the barstools			0
people are still talking about the night last june when a life vest inflated spontaneously inside the @entity173 , one of the most popular hangouts for the salvage crew			1
@entity177 , who runs the popular hangout , does n't mind the new clientele			0
sure he has had to introduce country music and imported beer for the new crowds , but he takes it all in stride			0
" they are hard workers who work long hours to move that monster from our waters , " he told @entity2			2
" they deserve a little down time			0
" @entity177 , who took over the bar from his parents two years ago , now stays open during the winter weeknights , something his parents could rarely afford to do because @entity0 just did n't produce enough customers			1
in the morning he , like most of the coffee bars along the port , will serve up @entity199 breakfast on request			0
they 've also learned what it takes to make a good cup of tea			0
all along the port , cafes and bakeries have adapted to the newcomers , some even mastering the art of making @entity212 's and sarnies for the workers ' packed lunches			1
and even after the @entity10 is rotated , the crews will have a lot of work to do to fix the starboard side and refloat the ship sometime next summer , meaning @entity0 wo n't be going to normal any time soon			1
most of the restaurateurs and business owners across the island hold nothing against the salvage crews who they feel are the only hope for getting rid of the rotting vessel			0
despite an obvious decline in tourism , there is a definite increase in steady customers , especially during the winter months when , prior to the shipwreck , @entity0 was a ghost island			1
@entity238 , who owns a small enoteca called @entity240 in @entity241 on the top of the island 's hill and a dive shop down in the port , says it is hypocritical for islanders to complain that the @entity10 has ruined their livelihood -- especially in the port			1
the economic slump surely has as much to do with a drop in tourists , and anyway , even in good years people were never able to rent their properties year round like they do now to the salvage workers			1
she even sees a silver lining			0
she is lobbying other islanders to push to keep the massive platforms @entity86 installed to stabilize the ship even after the @entity10 is towed away			2
" it would give us one of the best dive schools in the world , " she told @entity2			0
" we ca n't rewind the clock and pretend none of this happened , instead we have to look at ways to make it work for the island 's vitality			1
" @entity272 has been a strong voice both to the media and at the islanders ' monthly meetings with the salvage managers , environmental experts and @entity279 , the government 's commissioner for the @entity10 disaster			1
she agrees that now , when the removal of the ship is a top priority , may not be the best time to bring up life @entity286 , but she wants people to start thinking about the future again			0
plus , she points out that it could take up to two more years for workers to remove all the salvage implements they 've put in place , all the while the port views will be marred with cranes and rigs			2
" leave them , " she says			0
" they offer far more good than harm			0
" the tragedy has not exactly united the islanders			0
in some ways , it has created two camps -- those that see an economic advantage to the twist of fate and those who count the days until every trace of the ship is gone			0
it is not difficult to envision tense days ahead			0
@entity272 's main opposition to keeping the platforms is the island 's headstrong mayor @entity36 , who wants @entity317 to keep its promise to return his island to exactly the way it was before anyone had ever heard of the @entity10 -- and that means both above and below the waterline			1
@entity36 has a perfect view of the operation from his office window in the port and high - resolution diagrams of every stage of the parbuckling project on his computer , which he is happy to show on an overhead monitor to anyone who asks			0
he keeps track of the salvage schedule , logging days they 've lost to bad weather to make his own estimate about when the ship will finally be gone from his view			0
" we need our island back exactly way it was before that terrible day , " he says			0
he still recalls how many passengers slept in his office that fateful night , and he says he feels a personal responsibility to the islanders to hold @entity317 to its promise			0
" everything must go , " he says			0
" not just the ship			0
" no matter what happens after the physical remains of the liner are gone , the islanders will never forget how their lives changed the night of friday , the 13th of january , 2012 , when 4,200 people spilled into their quiet port			1
father @entity3 estimates that more than a thousand of the @entity10 's passengers have come back to @entity0 since the accident			1
many came to bring back the blankets and dry clothing that the islanders gave them the night of the disaster			0
merchants along the port 's main street usually know what belongs to whom by asking around			2
@entity0 still has the feel of a small town			2
in some ways everything has changed on @entity0 , but a few things still remain exactly the same			1
despite having one of the most technologically advanced salvage operations every attempted happening in the harbor , it is still impossible to buy an @entity380 charger or camera battery anywhere on the island , or read the day 's newspapers until the 9:00 a.m. ferry docks -- if someone remembers to send them over from the mainland			2
no one is ever in a particular hurry and the weather and food are just as wonderful as they were before the @entity10 came to shore .			2

@entity10 ran aground off @entity0 in january 2012 , killing 32 people
the 500 crew members working in @entity0 have transformed the tiny island 's social scene
*commerce* at the port has also changed to accommodate workers from 21 countries
