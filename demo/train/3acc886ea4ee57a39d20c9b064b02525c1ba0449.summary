-- a @entity2 watchdog group is calling for the @entity3 to investigate whether administrators broke state law when a whistleblowing employee 's credibility was repeatedly and publicly attacked following a @entity0 investigation into the reading levels of student - athletes			1
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , a 37 - year - old group that says it leads the nation in whistleblower protection , urged the inquiry in a letter to @entity17 chancellor @entity16 on march 6 , which the project made public friday			1
the group expresses alarm about university officials ' treatment of instructor and tutor @entity24 , who alleges the @entity17 campus has enrolled student - athletes with reading levels near the lowest elementary grades			1
in response to @entity11 's letter , university spokeswoman @entity28 and vice chancellor for @entity30 told @entity0 in an e-mail that the university insists it is committed to accountability and will be as transparent as possible in the controversy			1
about the group 's demand for an investigation , the two school officials cited how the university has already hired a @entity2 attorney to conduct an independent inquiry of " academic irregularities " that relate to another controversy involving student - athletes			1
that attorney , @entity47 , who had worked at the @entity48 for 19 years , may or may not look into alleged violations of the whistleblower law involving @entity24 , according to the officials			1
" how he proceeds , to whom he talks and what questions he asks will be up to him , " they said			0
" @entity55 will cooperate fully with mr. @entity47 and ensure that he has the full access he needs to complete his work			0
" @entity47 could n't be immediately reached for comment saturday			0
group has harsh language for comments in their letter , the government watchdogs allege at least three instances since january in which it says @entity3 officials responded poorly to @entity24 's claims that she tutored and researched athletes in revenue - generating sports who were reading at levels as low as third grade			1
the group noted that after @entity24 spoke to @entity0 , @entity3 immediately challenged her , saying in a press release " we do n't believe that claim			1
" but @entity11 president @entity75 said the comments of @entity3 provost @entity77 in the ensuing days were particularly offensive			1
in january , at a public faculty meeting , @entity77 verbally attacked @entity24 's credibility and called her research " unworthy of this university , " according to @entity75 's letter			1
@entity77 also mischaracterized her research as being critical of all athletes when she had been very clear that it dealt with a sample of about 180 athletes , @entity75 said			0
several days later , @entity77 flew to @entity88 for an in - person interview with the @entity91 news outlet			0
@entity77 denounced @entity24 's findings and called them " a lie			2
" when the @entity91 reporter asked @entity77 whether he stood by those comments , @entity77 said he misspoke			0
@entity77 has not since spoken publicly on the topic and declined through a representative a @entity0 request for comment			0
@entity3 spokeswoman @entity28 stated there " has been no need for provost @entity77 to offer any additional comments			0
" @entity75 , in @entity11 's press release , said that the reaction from @entity77 and other @entity3 officials was " disgraceful , morally wrong and legally questionable			1
" he asked chancellor @entity16 to investigate whether @entity3 's whistleblower policy -- which relies on state law because it 's a state institution -- was violated			1
a chilling effect ? @entity11 says the policy states that employees should be " free of intimidation or harassment			1
" " it is simply unacceptable for a person in a position of such authority to make disparaging comments about an employee who has raised legitimate and important concerns about the education of student - athletes , " the letter states			1
" the effect of these actions is that @entity17 is perceived as a bully who is intent on publicly smearing a well - meaning employee rather than fairly addressing the substance of the concerns being raised , " the letter says , referring to the main @entity17 campus			2
@entity75 also wrote that @entity3 's response and @entity77 's comments have a damaging and chilling effect on whistleblowers			1
that 's something @entity24 alleges she has already experienced			2
@entity24 said that in hundreds of e-mails privately supporting her , very few people -- at a diverse set of academic institutions -- say they are willing to imperil their careers by publicly talking about the issue of athlete literacy , let alone voicing support for her work			2
echoing that , many people who have talked to @entity0 since january have sought anonymity , noting the criticism of @entity24 and the death threats that she received in the days after @entity0 's initial report			2
among those is the psychologist who administered the tests that @entity24 used to determine the reading levels of the athletes she studied			2
the psychologist stands behind @entity24 , but asked @entity0 not to use her name because she feared for her personal safety			0
@entity0 has n't published her name			0
@entity162 asserts her data is flawed meanwhile , the university continues its assertions that @entity24 's research was flawed , despite her claims that she personally tutored almost every one of the athletes in her study			2
@entity3 is expected to release a second review of @entity24 's data in the coming days			1
in a related matter , another university - sanctioned review of academic fraud is under way			0
last month , @entity16 announced the university hired @entity47 , a business fraud attorney , to take another look at the so - called " paper class scandal , " where athletes allegedly were taking classes in which the only requirement was completing a single paper			2
@entity47 also served as homeland security adviser under president @entity185			0
@entity24 , who has worked with athletes for several years , also helped expose the paper class scandal two years ago in the @entity188			0
despite seven prior reviews , that scandal continues to nag the university as officials insist it was the doing of a single professor			0
@entity24 says the existence of such classes was well - known , and athletes who could n't read were steered toward them			2
the accused professor , @entity199 , has been indicted on a fraud charge related to the scandal			0
he has pleaded not guilty			0
earlier this month , district attorney @entity203 of @entity204 and @entity205 counties announced that the criminal probe is over , and no one else will be charged .			0

@entity11 demands a probe in a letter to @entity17
an attorney hired to look into another case may -- or may not -- do probe , @entity3 says
@entity24 exposed how @entity3 enrolls student - athletes reading at third - grade level
@entity3 's whistleblower policy says employees should be " free of intimidation "
