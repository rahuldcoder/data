-- racist abuse , missiles from the crowd , a pitch invader and five goals in an action - packed thriller -- sunday 's 164th @entity9 derby epitomized all that is good and bad about @entity12 football			1
on the field , @entity13 snatched a 3 - 2 victory that gave @entity17 's team a healthy six - point lead from second - placed @entity20 champions @entity19			1
but the non-sporting incidents continued -- in tune with more than a year of controversies that have plagued arguably the world 's most lucrative and widely supported domestic soccer competition , starting with the @entity28 - @entity27 racism incident in october 2011			2
@entity29 was once known as the " @entity12 disease " -- but the game 's malady is more pervasive than mere violence			0
this time @entity27 's older brother @entity35 was involved , being hit in the face by a coin as he celebrated @entity39 's injury - time winner			1
while the former @entity41 international wiped the blood from his face , @entity19 goalkeeper @entity40 intervened to confront a fan who had invaded the pitch -- police then hauled him from the ground			1
the @entity9 force also reported after the match that another man had been arrested inside @entity19 's @entity52 on suspicion of chanting racist abuse			1
" it 's disappointing that after a great game and advert for the @entity20 that we are discussing this issue , " said the @entity54 in a statement on sunday			2
" we will work with the clubs and authorities to identify those responsible and support the strongest sanctions available , including life bans			0
" we condemn any such acts and it is simply unacceptable that any player is exposed to injury in this way			0
to witness @entity70 leaving the field with a cut above his eye to receive treatment is appalling			0
" @entity13 manager @entity17 also condemned the transgressions , calling for action by the authorities as he cited similar problems during october 's controversial clash at @entity80 -- which saw ref @entity81 accused of racism before being cleared , and @entity83 fined and banned for confronting the official after the match			2
revived @entity86 fires up @entity80 " it was disappointing that a supporter ran on the field after @entity35 had been hit by a coin in the eye , " @entity17 told mutv			0
" it 's a bit disappointing			0
the game did n't deserve that			0
" i do n't know whether they 're going to stitch it or not			0
the same thing happened at @entity80 with all the carry - on when half a seat hit @entity101 and coins and lighters were thrown on			2
the game does n't need that			0
" @entity19 released an apologetic statement afterwards promising to investigate , but @entity27 laughed off the coin attack as he posted on his @entity109 account after the game			2
" what a result , 3 points ! sweet ! whoever threw that coin , what a shot ! ca n't believe it was a copper 2p ...			2
could have at least been a Â£ 1 coin ! , " the 34 - year - old wrote			0
" respect to @entity40 for protecting that idiot who ran on ! ! love the banter between fans but there is a point when it goes too far ... calm it ! " the problems also extended to the internet , with the @entity129 reporting on @entity109 that it is investigating reports of racist tweets			0
earlier it had reported that a man had been arrested outside the @entity52 on suspicion of ticket touting , but a prematch prediction from the man in charge of policing the game proved wide of the mark			2
" i have every confidence this match will mirror the two derbies last season and the football will be the only talking point , " superintendent @entity140 said			0
last season @entity19 thrashed @entity13 6 - 1 at @entity147 on the same day that @entity28 clashed with @entity148 ' @entity27			1
the fallout from that incident cost the @entity80 player the @entity41 captaincy , then he was cleared of racial abuse in court before being fined and banned by the @entity54			0
@entity156 's team won 1 - 0 in the home derby on april 30 before claiming the 2011 - 12 league title on goal difference from @entity17 's men on the final day of the season			1
@entity156 's role at the @entity164 - owned club has become more precarious since then , with @entity19 crashing out of the @entity165 at the group stage for the second season in a row			1
sunday 's defeat ended @entity19 's 21 - match unbeaten run in the @entity20 , 15 of those this season , and halted a run of 37 matches without defeat at home which stretched back to december 2010			1
@entity177 scored a last - gasp winner for @entity13 , firing in a free - kick that was deflected past @entity40 , whose team had fought back from a 2 - 0 halftime deficit			1
" it 's very hard to lose a derby , but even more so in the last minute , so i 'm very disappointed , " @entity156 said			0
" we dominated the second half , and for this reason i am really disappointed			0
" they scored from their first two goal - scoring opportunities but after that we dominated the game and fought back really well -- but we ca n't then give a goal away after working so hard			0
" i think we made a mistake for the @entity177 free - kick at the end by only putting three men in the wall			1
i wanted four but i could n't get the instruction over and i think that cost us the goal			0
we should have defended this free - kick better and we had chances to win this game , but there is nothing we can do about it now			1
" @entity13 had conceded first in 15 of 23 games so far this season , but a double inside the opening half hour from @entity207 -- which made the 27 - year - old @entity41 striker the youngest player to score 150 in the @entity20 -- put @entity17 's team in the driving seat			1
@entity13 winger @entity213 had a goal disallowed for offside after @entity177 hit the woodwork just before the hour , and @entity19 reduced the deficit 60 seconds later through midfielder @entity218 before defender @entity219 drove in a low shot from an 86th - minute corner			1
however , @entity177 had the final say as he netted his 11th league goal since signing from @entity224 for $ 38 million in august , with @entity19 midfielder @entity225 guilty of backing away in his position in the defensive wall and sticking out a leg to divert the ball past a helpless @entity40 in the second of four extra minutes			2
city substitute @entity231 , who came on for @entity233 seven minutes after the break , was lucky to avoid punishment after aiming a wild kick at @entity13 's @entity237 late in the match			1
meanwhile , @entity239 moved up to fourth place with a 2 - 1 victory at home to @entity243 on sunday thanks to injury - time goals from @entity245 and @entity246			1
@entity247 had opened the scoring in the 76th minute for @entity243 , who dropped to fifth above @entity250 on goal difference			0
@entity252 claimed 10th place with a 3 - 2 victory at @entity255 , as @entity256 conceded a late own goal after @entity258 and @entity259 scored against their former club .			1

@entity13 go six points clear in @entity20 with 3 - 2 derby win
@entity39 scores late winner against second - placed champions @entity19
@entity207 put @entity13 2 - 0 up inside the first half hour at @entity52
@entity19 leveled through @entity218 and @entity219 before injury - time free kick
