-- one of the many questions surrounding the revelation that @entity4 @entity3 and @entity5 received a little - known , experimental serum for their @entity8 infection is : " why did we hear nothing about it earlier , and how did they gain access to it ? " @entity8 has no cure , although potential medications and vaccines are in various states of development			1
the @entity21 , an experimental product of @entity22 , has n't been tested in humans , which means it does n't meet a primary requirement for @entity26 approval -- so its obscurity is no surprise			1
the @entity4 managed to gain access to what more than 1,660 infected people in @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and now @entity34 did not : medicine that seems to work -- although , of course , we do n't know for sure yet			1
some reports indicate they received @entity39 under the @entity26 's " compassionate use " rule , which permits untested drugs to be given to consenting patients who might otherwise die			1
this is a triumph of common sense and compassion over bureaucratic red tape			0
one of the chief concerns about using unapproved medications is that we do n't know what the risks are : the drug may not work , it may work with serious adverse effects , or it may prove as deadly as the disease			2
but as a doctor , @entity3 understood the risks , and like him , @entity5 had no other options			0
most people with @entity8 die			2
compassionate use is certainly ethically defensible			0
but apparently only three doses were available , and they were given to @entity61			0
the lack of broader access to @entity39 highlights what is often a very serious ethical failing			2
9 questions about this new @entity8 drug why did n't dr. sheik @entity68 , the chief @entity32 physician who died while treating @entity8 patients , receive this medication ? because another method of determining who gets medications is at work here -- the drearily familiar stratification of access to a drug based on economic resources and being a westerner rather than a resident of the @entity82			1
no health worker wants to intentionally deprive @entity84 of a needed drug			1
but informal medical networks , which @entity84 lack , connect well - to - do @entity61 with information and drugs			1
in addition , the pharmaceutical industry has a history of declining to test medications for diseases of the tropical world , most of whose inhabitants can not afford high prices			0
we do n't know how quickly @entity39 could be made in large quantities			2
if it were to be made available , who should receive it ? some think @entity8 doctors and caregivers should , because their survival is essential to treating and quelling the epidemic			1
this makes sense , but it 's not that simple			0
first , it violates the principle of distributive justice : the benefits of the drug are being inequitably distributed , with skilled , economically secure professionals more likely to benefit			0
also , by what reckoning do we decide that the doctors ' role increases their value and dictates they should be given a preferential chance to survive ? distributing the drug through a clinical trial would allow us to know whether and how well the medication works and what caveats might apply			2
@entity84 must participate in any clinical trial , which would benefit the pharmaceutical company as well as , it 's hoped , @entity8 victims			1
this would mean their lives have irreplaceable value , too , in the equation of who should get the drug			0
so , will @entity84 receive this potentially lifesaving medication ? a @entity139 official suggested that drugs can not be tested in the middle of an epidemic -- but he is wrong			1
such tests are conducted all the time			0
dr. @entity144 tested @entity146 drugs in @entity147 in the midst of the pandemic , and the meningitis drug @entity151 was tested in @entity152 , @entity34 , in the midst of an epidemic			2
one of every three industry trials is conducted in developing countries ; scientists often point to high disease rates , including epidemics , as a rationale for conducting them there			0
the problem is not testing the drug amid an epidemic			0
the question is how ethically such trials are conducted			0
only small amounts of @entity39 are available now , but as soon as it can be made in quantity , the drug for @entity8 should be made available to @entity84 in all the regions that are threatened by the epidemic , regardless of ability to pay			1
if possible , it should be distributed within clinical trials to determine the safety and efficiency of the medications			0
many people assume this requires withholding medications in a control group , but this is not necessarily the case			0
experts should and can mount a well - designed study that permits early access to the medication to all who need it			0
but if they can not ensure that sick people get the drug early , then a clinical trial should not be any more of a requirement for poor @entity84 than it was for @entity3			1
it 's also natural to wonder whether the threat of @entity8 to the western world , not to @entity84 , drives this initiative because so few such drugs are devised for @entity84			1
this simply highlights another reason why we should so our utmost to protect people from @entity8 : our medical interdependence			2
if @entity8 makes landfall in the @entity4 , we will need drugs like @entity39 , just as @entity84 need them today .			1

@entity4 with @entity8 received an experimental medicine that seemed to help
@entity211 : poor @entity84 do n't have access to lifesaving medicines
she says access to drugs often based on how much money you have and if you *'re* a @entity220
she urges this drug be made in quantity and given to infected @entity224 in a trial
