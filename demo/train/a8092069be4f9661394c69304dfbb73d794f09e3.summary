-- the shooting of 26 innocent children and teachers in an elementary school in @entity5 , @entity6 , is more horrific than any of us can ever imagine			1
we ask , like many times before , how such a brutal and irrational act could have happened			2
why would anyone do something like this ? president @entity13 wants to take action ; our neighbors want to take action			0
we all want to convince ourselves that the world has not gone mad			0
we want to find and address the core of the problem			0
so we look hard for explanations			0
some say evil has shown itself -- a simplistic salve			1
in our hearts , we know that the shooter , @entity26 , was not evil personified			1
we know at this point that he was a withdrawn , socially awkward young man , reportedly with @entity30 's syndrome , living with his mother			1
we would like to think that if only professionals could identify any shooters before they commit any violence , then we could prevent these tragedies			1
if they had been locked up , then they could n't have killed anyone			0
or if they had been forced to take their medicine , then they would n't have gotten to a point of no return			0
if we can find these people , keep guns away from them , restrict their civil liberties and monitor them closely enough , then we would have solved the problem			1
this approach wo n't work			0
the picture is much more complex than simply developing " profiles			0
" knowing this young man 's profile would n't have told us how likely he was going to walk into a classroom and open fire			1
opinion : after tragedy , do n't obsess , heal gently there are a large number of withdrawn , socially awkward young men in our society ; some have mental disorders and some do n't			1
we simply can not predict which ones will go on a shooting rampage			1
it 's like looking for a needle in a haystack ; you will probably only know where it is when it pricks your finger			1
of those who do have a mental disorder , few of them reach the level of extreme desperation that they want to die and hurt others ( very dramatically ) in the process			2
people fluctuate in how distraught or likely they are to commit violence , depending on either deterioration of their mental condition , or , like all of us do , in reaction to events in their lives ( a disparaging remark from a co-worker , a lost romantic relationship , etc )			1
we can not readily determine who might become so desperate as to see mass killings as reasonable			2
striking out at others is often a combination of giving up mixed with rage			0
in one young man whom i knew , it could have gone either way			0
he walked in front of a train , but he could have as easily hurt many others to relieve his pain and despair			0
getting support and services to the people who matter to those with mental disorders is where the answer lies			1
we will only know what is happening in a troubled person 's mind by talking to them regularly before they are desperate			1
the idea of identifying , ostracizing and restricting them is not only inhuman , but impossible			2
we need to embrace them as members of our community who are facing immense struggles			0
but most people with mental disorders are n't in treatment			1
about 1 in 4 adults in the @entity131 suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year			2
we are n't , however , willing to invest the resources to provide ongoing outpatient care to them			0
besides they may be afraid to reveal problems to professionals who seem out of touch with their lives			0
parents of disturbed , struggling children and adolescents need to know and talk to parents in similar situations			0
these parents know that they may get the telephone call at 2 a.m. with news of some tragic incident , and they need the support of others who understand what they are facing on a daily basis			0
opinion : get serious about mental health care looking for individuals with mental illness and their parents only subverts what we all want -- to find out in advance about these incidents and to keep them from happening			2
by staying in touch with those who are suffering with mental disorder , we are in the best position to help them -- and their parents -- to forestall any possible slip into violence			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			1
