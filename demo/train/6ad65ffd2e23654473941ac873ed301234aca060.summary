-- a woman in @entity2 recently wrote us about her struggles in finding the time and the money to take care of her health			2
@entity9 wrote , " i am 33 years old and without @entity10 i would have never found out in time that i 'm a woman with precancerous cells in my uterus and cervix			2
i can not afford to pay for my health care , and by them having a sliding scale i could afford it or else otherwise i may have died from cervical cancer			1
i would n't have found out about it in time			0
... ( now ) i can see my children grow up			0
" this week , as we celebrate @entity23 -- a time when women are encouraged to make our health a priority by scheduling wellness checkups -- @entity9 's story came to my mind			1
like many women , @entity9 is busy with her family , balancing bills and struggling without health insurance			0
but she finally took the time to put herself first and went to get a checkup			0
it 's amazing to think that those few precious moments she spent in an exam room potentially saved her and her family from mounds of medical bills and emotional agony			0
but for a significant number of women in this country , accessing preventive health care services such as lifesaving cancer screenings , birth control , and well - woman exams is becoming more difficult , thanks to legislators who are putting politics before women 's health			1
in fact , in @entity9 's home state of @entity2 this week , the legislature is debating a bill that if enacted would hurt thousands of women by eliminating federal funding for pap tests , breast exams , @entity65 prevention and treatment , and prenatal care at @entity10 health centers throughout the state			1
for many women , @entity10 is the only doctor 's visit they will have all year			1
@entity9 does n't come to @entity10 to make a political statement , but to get high - quality , affordable health care			1
yet what is happening to patients in states like @entity2 is just a preview of what women can expect from @entity81 if he is elected president			2
his promise to strike down the @entity85 and its requirement that health plans cover birth control without co-pays , along with his pledge to end the nation 's family planning program -- which provides preventive care to nearly 5 million women -- and his vow to " get rid " of @entity10 would have real and serious consequences for millions of women nationwide			1
unlike @entity81 , we wo n't let politics interfere with the health care that one in five women in @entity105 have relied on at some point in their lives			1
@entity10 's doors are open today and they 'll be open tomorrow			2
but that does n't mean these attacks are n't dangerous for all of us -- our mothers , sisters , daughters , nieces , and grandmothers			0
@entity81 prides himself on being an astute businessman , but any woman balancing her checkbook right now could tell him that attacking basic preventive care is fiscally irresponsible			2
unintended pregnancies already cost taxpayers $ 11 billion a year			1
breast cancer caught late can be deadly , and it leaves families emotionally and financially bankrupt			0
preventive care saves lives and money			0
my hope this @entity23 is that together we can shine a light on the irony of these legislative maneuvers			0
most important , i hope that the annual observance provides an opportunity for lawmakers to take pause			0
they must be made to see that attacks on health care threaten the lives and well - being of real women			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity146 .			0

@entity146 : @entity23 a good time to remember women should get checkup
she says women 's preventive health care crucial : birth control , cancer screening , checkups
@entity81 wants to strike down health *reform* act , " get rid of " @entity10 , she says
@entity146 : unintended pregnancies cost taxpayers $ 11 billion / year
