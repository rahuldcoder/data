@entity25 , executive producer , @entity15 : during the school year , i 'm in charge of the content for @entity0 : the program and the website			2
in fact , i 'm in charge of the content throughout the year			2
but i like to take a look ahead in the summer			1
so , one thing we do a lot of here is planning			2
you ca n't predict the news , but you can tell when there are some important events that you 're going to have to focus on			2
for example , the election in 2012 is going to be very important			2
but we also know that , you know , @entity46 in february and @entity47 in march , @entity45 are all months that we like to focus on here at @entity0			0
there are also people who come to @entity4 during the summer , and they 'll send us e-mails and say , " we 're coming			1
is there anybody from @entity0 we could say hello to ? " and if we 're here , we 'd love to come downstairs and say hi and do a little meet - and - greet with you			1

@entity57 : this week , we 're going behind the scenes to see what the @entity88 staff is working on this summer , and the next person we 're going to talk to is our associate producer , @entity90			1
@entity91 , associate producer , @entity15 : so , this summer i 'll be focusing on some more career connections segments that you may have seen throughout the 2010 - 2011 school year			1
you 're going to get to see the behind - the - scenes of an editor who puts together some cool stuff , not just for our show , but for several other shows			1
but on top of that , i 'm going to be working with teaming up with different departments , like @entity104 and @entity0 en @entity105			1
so that way , for the next school year -- for the 2011 - 2012 school year -- we can try to get more guests , and we can try to diversify our level of guests that come on our show			1
@entity57 : now , there 's one person on the @entity88 staff who does n't need an introduction from me			1
@entity117 , @entity118 , @entity15 : all right , you know what i do during the school year			0
but i have a second job here at @entity0 many of you may not know about			0
it 's done right here in @entity0 's main studio , and i 'm usually on between 12 noon and 1 p.m. @entity127 speaking with @entity0 's @entity128			0
i deliver reports that go in depth and give a little more detail about some of the stories in the news			0
so , if you 're around between 12 and 1 p.m. , turn on @entity136 ; i might see you there			0
and another thing i 'll be doing over the summer is i might be filing some reports from @entity141 , i 'm looking forward to going to the nation 's capital and doing a little work from there			1
@entity57 : next up is going to be our web producer , @entity148			1
@entity149 , @entity150 , @entity15 : during the school year , i 'm responsible for @entity152			0
i make sure the show is available for streaming			1
i make sure that the show 's available for podcast			1
during the summer , i 'm working on some behind - the - scenes things : possibly redesigning @entity152 , redesigning our daily e-mail			1

i 'm also the department copyeditor			0
so , you know how your teachers take a red pen to your work sometimes ? i do that , but i do it professionally , and with red type on the computer , not a red pen			0
over the summer , i 'm obviously anchoring one of our summer shows , and i 'm producing some of our shows as well			1
i 'm also doing some writing for @entity211			0
it 's a chance to do some extra stuff in different areas and take on new challenges			0

@entity221 : animals ! @entity57 : i can bearly think of any ideas			0
a jungle cat on the loose ? you must be lion ! @entity221 : food ! @entity57 : a donut - eating competition is no holes barred			2
lettuce has a bad attitude , but only because it 's at a rough - age			2
@entity221 : seasons ! @entity57 : nothing springs to mind			0
