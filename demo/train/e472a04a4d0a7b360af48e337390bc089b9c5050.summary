fool me once , shame on you			0
fool me twice , shame on me			0
fool me three times ? good grief , no one should ever be fooled three times			0
but that 's exactly what will happen to the @entity8 -- and the @entity10 people -- unless president @entity11 puts a leash on an unchecked @entity13			1
he now must stop it from taking any more steps to try to hide its record of torture , secret prisons and the kidnapping program known as extraordinary rendition			0
under the leadership of chairwoman @entity24 , @entity25 , the committee conducted a five - year investigation into the @entity13 's use of torture between 2001 and 2006			2
senators and their staff members reviewed more than 3 million pages of @entity13 documents , resulting in a report of more than 6,000 pages			2
the committee voted thursday to submit its report on torture to the executive branch for a declassification review and then public release			1
one of the very few conclusions of the report that will be made public is that the @entity13 repeatedly misled @entity42 , the @entity43 and the @entity44 on the facts of the torture program			1
an entire section of the report is dedicated to @entity13 falsehoods , presumably including lies to the very committee charged with overseeing the @entity13			2
fool the @entity8 once , shame on the @entity13			1
after nearly four years of investigating , the committee voted in december 2012 to adopt the report but delayed any vote on declassifying it until the @entity13 -- the agency that the committee had just concluded had lied to @entity42 and carried out all of the illegal conduct in the report -- had 60 days to review the report			1
well , 60 days turned into more than six months as the @entity13 reportedly found almost no factual errors in the report but nonetheless wrote a couple hundred pages reportedly asserting the efficacy of the program and attacking the report 's methodology			2
the agency , however , was n't done			0
it then ran a whisper campaign among reporters to disparage the @entity8 report			2
the @entity13 campaign to hide the truth did n't just stop with foot dragging or writing counter-reports			2
it reportedly went as far as spying on the @entity8 staff 's use of computers dedicated for their exclusive use			0
@entity24 has characterized the reported incidents as possibly violating the constitutional separation of powers principle , the @entity80 , a criminal computer fraud statute and an executive order banning the @entity13 from spying domestically			0
the @entity13 must be held responsible for any laws broken , but it is certainly reasonable to ask why the @entity8 or the @entity43 ever let the agency get its controlling hands on the report in the first place			1
fool the @entity8 twice , shame on the @entity8			0
with the committee poised to vote to submit the torture report for a declassification review and then public release , it is worth asking : will the @entity8 risk getting fooled by the @entity13 a third time ? @entity13 director @entity95 has promised to play nice , saying that if sent the @entity8 torture report yet again , the @entity13 would " carry out the review expeditiously			1
" yes , let 's again entrust the report to the agency that broke the law on torture and was so brazen that until this month , its acting @entity13 general counsel was a lawyer named 1,600 times in the torture report			1
only a fool would be fooled three times			0
@entity24 should insist -- and @entity11 should agree -- that the @entity43 itself conduct the declassification review			0
furthermore , only @entity43 officials who had no role in any of the banned practices described in the report should be involved in the review , and the @entity13 should be consulted only as needed -- with only @entity13 officials untainted by torture looped in			1
by law , the president has authority to declassify information , and he surely has the authority to decide the process for declassifying this landmark report			0
the @entity13 should never have had a torture program , never should have lied about what it was doing and never should have been given broad authority to review the @entity8 oversight report			1
@entity11 can not now hand the agency a black - out pen to continue to hide the horrors it inflicted around the globe and the harm it caused to our @entity10 values			1
it 's time for someone other than the @entity13 to decide what all @entity10 can know about its wrongs			1
let 's not be fooled again			0
join us on @entity142 / @entity141 .			0

@entity144 *worries* that @entity13 is trying to slip one past @entity8 and @entity10 people

@entity144 says president @entity11 needs to rein in the *troubled* agency
