@entity0 -- health care reform advocates inched closer to victory wednesday as a high - profile @entity4 switched his position and announced his intention to vote for a sweeping $ 875 billion plan under consideration in the @entity10			1
rep. @entity11 , @entity12 , said he believes " health care is a civil right			1
" he had previously characterized the bill , which cleared the @entity16 in december , as little more than a boondoggle for private insurers			1
@entity11 was publicly lobbied for his vote by president @entity20 during the president 's visit this week to @entity11 's congressional district in @entity24			1
he told reporters he 's had four meetings with @entity20 to discuss the bill			2
" the president 's visit to my district ... underscored the urgency of this vote , " @entity11 said			1
" i have doubts about the bill ... [ but ] i 've decided to cast a vote in favor of the legislation			2
" he said he ultimately had " to make a decision on the bill as it is , not on the bill as i 'd like to see it			2
" @entity11 is a backer of a single - payer health care system under which the government would fund all costs billed by doctors and hospitals			1
@entity11 's decision to change his vote is " a good sign , " @entity20 told reporters in the @entity47			1
" i told him thank you			0
" house speaker @entity49 , @entity50 , said she thought @entity11 's switch would make a difference with a large number of liberal activists			1
" he 's been a supporter of health care for all @entity56 for a long time , " she said			1
" he has a constituency , and many of those people still do n't understand why there is n't a public [ option ]			0
" @entity49 has repeatedly expressed confidence that she will have enough support to pass the bill when it comes to the floor for a final vote			2
read more about how votes are lining up @entity70 rep. @entity69 , the no. 2 house democrat , indicated wednesday the vote could come at some point this weekend			1
he said the leadership is still waiting for final cost estimates from the nonpartisan @entity76 on a package of changes to the measure			2
asked if the release of the @entity76 numbers was imminent , @entity49 said , " i would have said ... half an hour ago , hopefully any minute			2
i think it 's going to take a little more time			2
" she said she had no explanation for the delay			0
" i do n't know the calculation , " she said			0
" i do n't know how they do it			0
whatever it is , they 're the gospel and we have to live by it			0
" later , @entity49 spokesman @entity94 said that the @entity76 estimates would not be released wednesday night			1
since the @entity98 have said the bill will be available for reading for 72 hours before a vote , the vote can take place no sooner than sunday , provided the @entity76 numbers are posted thursday			1
@entity49 needs 216 votes from her 253 - member caucus to pass the @entity16 bill			2
no republicans are expected to back it			0
a number of @entity10 @entity98 have refused to state their voting intentions publicly			0
twenty - seven @entity98 , however , have indicated they will join republicans in opposing the @entity16 plan			0
that puts opponents of reform 11 votes shy of the 216 needed to prevent @entity20 from scoring a major victory on his top domestic priority			0
meanwhile , @entity119 leaders continued to pound away at the legislation on wednesday , slamming @entity10 @entity122 leaders for considering the use of a controversial legislative maneuver to pass the @entity16 bill			1
@entity49 may try to help @entity10 @entity98 unhappy with the @entity16 bill by allowing them to avoid a direct vote on the measure			2
she is considering pushing for a vote on a rule that would simply " deem " the @entity16 bill to be passed			2
the @entity10 then would proceed to a separate vote on the more popular package of changes to the @entity16 plan			2
" i 've never seen anything like the plan that @entity10 @entity98 hatched this week to jam their health care bill through @entity137 , " senate minority leader @entity132 , @entity133 , said wednesday			1
" historians will remember this as a new low in this debate , the week that @entity56 was introduced to the ' scheme and deem ' approach to legislating			0
they 'll remember this as the week that @entity137 tried to pull the wool over the eyes of the public in order to get around their will			0
" @entity10 minority leader @entity151 , @entity152 , said tuesday that @entity106 will try to block the procedure			0
they will try to force a vote on a resolution requiring the @entity16 health care bill to be brought to an up - or - down vote			1
@entity151 has called the maneuver -- also known as a " self - executing rule " -- the " ultimate in @entity0 power grabs			0
" @entity10 @entity106 sent a letter to the @entity122 head of the @entity163 on wednesday asking her to move an upcoming hearing on the health care bill to a larger room to account for overwhelming public interest in the issue			1
the committee is responsible for deciding whether the full @entity10 will have a chance to pass the @entity16 bill using the self - executing rule			0
" while @entity174 may decide to cover the hearing , that does not satisfy the need for the maximum amount of transparency and openness needed to give the @entity56 people faith in this process , " the letter said			0
" by moving the hearing to a larger room , we can ensure more @entity56 will have the opportunity to participate in our proceedings and not be turned away at the door			0
" where does health care reform stand ? if enacted , the @entity122 reform proposal would constitute the biggest expansion of federal health care guarantees since the enactment of @entity193 and @entity194 more than four decades ago			1
the plan is expected to extend insurance coverage to more than 30 million @entity56			0
the @entity16 bill also would reduce federal deficits by about $ 118 billion over 10 years , according to @entity76 estimates			1
@entity106 contend the plan amounts to an ill - conceived government takeover of the country 's health care system			1
they have said it would do little to slow spiraling medical costs			0
they also argue it would lead to higher premiums and taxes for middle - class families while resulting in deep @entity193 cuts			0
public opinion polls indicate a majority of @entity56 have turned against the administration 's health care reform plan , though individual elements of the proposal remain widely popular			1
@entity1 's @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this report .			0

@entity122 leaders say timing of vote will depend on @entity76 figures , which are delayed
rep. @entity11 , @entity12 , on wednesday said he intends to vote for health care bill
@entity11 previously had characterized the bill as a boondoggle for private insurers
