-- " you can be as racist as you want , as long as you keep your mouth shut , " says @entity0			1
the former @entity5 great should know			1
the @entity7 - born @entity6 international was subjected to racist abuse including an infamous incident 27 years ago when a fan threw a banana at him during a @entity15 derby between @entity5 and rivals @entity16			1
@entity0 kicked the piece of fruit away			2
fast forward to 2014 and @entity21 's @entity20 was similarly taunted , though the @entity22 picked up and ate the banana that had been hurled at him by a @entity25 supporter			1
according to @entity0 , the fact that bananas are still been throwing at games shows football 's approach to tackling discrimination is befuddled			1
" the way we 're trying to deal with it , in terms of getting rid of it , is wrong , " @entity0 , who played for @entity6 between 1983 and 1995 , told @entity3 at a promotional event for @entity33 ! sushi aimed at encouraging fans to back @entity41 at the @entity42			2
" only through education and making people know why it 's wrong to do it			2
" just by saying to people ' you 're not allowed to do it ' without telling them why , explaining to them why ... or fining them when they do it , so they just keep their mouth shut is not getting rid of it			0
" do we want to get rid of racism ? or do we want just not to hear it ? what football is saying , by fining and banning people , is ' you can be as racist as you want , but as long as you keep your mouth shut it 's fine			1
' " that 's not what i 'm interested in			0
" one week after @entity20 was abused , @entity69 's @entity68 player @entity67 claimed he heard monkey chants from @entity72 supporters			1
his response was to dance in front of his alleged abusers but , while he fully support @entity20 ' actions , @entity0 questioned @entity67 's reaction			1
" i think @entity20 showed disdain , he showed disregard , " he added			0
" he showed that if you 're being bullied and the bullies are n't effecting you , they will stop bullying you			0
" if you react to it , they will continue to do it			0
from a playing perspective , i think that 's the right way to respond			0
" while praising @entity25 for acting swiftly to ban the fan who threw the banana at @entity20 , @entity0 warned that football might be fighting a losing battle in trying to eradicate racist abuse			1
" these are n't football 's problems			0
until we get rid of it in society , we wo n't get rid of it in football , " added @entity0 , who memorably scored a remarkable solo goal in the @entity97 against @entity98 in a 1 - 0 friendly win for @entity6 in june 1984			2
" from an institutional perspective , yes you ban the fan , as the club did , if you 've got to close stadiums , fine players or take points off clubs , that 's what you do			0
" football 's world governing body @entity113 introduced a series of punishments after a number of high - profile racism cases in 2013			2
the punishments for a first offense is a warning , fine or the club in question being forced to play games in empty stadiums			0
a second offense , or one deemed " serious , " could result in demotion , a deduction of points or expulsion from a tournament .			0
