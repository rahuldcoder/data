@entity0 -- human rights campaigners have welcomed a landmark decision in @entity4 designed to combat domestic violence			1
however , they urge caution			1
the country 's legal system is based on sharia law and rarely sees new laws being introduced			2
critics allege that @entity4 is known for suppressing women 's rights , and it remains to be seen how this law will be put into practice , according to experts			1
for the first time in @entity4 's history the kingdom 's cabinet has approved a ban on domestic violence and other forms of abuse both at home and in the workplace			1
the law , which was passed last monday , is meant to protect every citizen , but in particular the most vulnerable including children , women and domestic workers			2
the law is expected to be implemented within 90 days			1
@entity33 , a @entity4 researcher for @entity34 , said : " we welcome the law because it makes crimes such as physical and emotional abuse easier to prosecute and it is a step in the right direction -- but the law has some major drawbacks			1
i 'd urge caution until we see how exactly this law will be implemented and whether domestic abuse cases will now actually be punished in courts			1
" the law states that physical or sexual violence is punishable with a minimum jail sentence of one month and a maximum of one year , and fines of up to $ 13,300			1
judges can double the sentence for repeat offenders			0
abuse victims will be given access to necessary health care , psychological treatment and family counseling			0
according to @entity33 , male guardianship in @entity4 is a major obstacle to the new law			1
" how can a woman escape an abusive husband if she 's not allowed to drive and ca n't even travel without the permission of her male guardian ? " @entity33 said			2
he is also concerned that the law does not mention the issue of marital rape			0
@entity69 , a @entity4 writer and blogger who tweets as @entity71 , told @entity1 : " having this in a country where we still have male guardianship system , where we still have child marriage -- it 's a contradiction -- these things are still legal and yet you 're talking about protection from harassment			2
it does n't seem like a system where a lot of action will be taken			0
this seems to be more about talking than actually implementing			0
" @entity4 woman files suit over right to drive domestic violence is a problem in @entity4 but no reliable figures exist on how many people get abused each year			1
according to researchers there have been very few instances in the past where rapes and physical violence cases went to court as women do not dare to come forward			2
until last week , no written penal code existed on domestic violence and physical abuse			1
that means that it was up to individual judges to determine what actions are illegal and how to punish them , if at all			0
the new law makes it easier to punish such crimes as they now can rely on written regulations			2
" judges own the courtroom , " @entity33 said			0
" " a man 's testimony still carries more weight than that of a woman so we 'll have to see whether this law will change the status quo			2
" billionaire @entity4 prince tweets support for women driving @entity125 , president of @entity4 's @entity126 which is backed by the @entity4 government , told @entity1 : " this is a very important law			1
we 've been working on it for a long time			0
i 'm very pleased to see it enacted			0
@entity134 himself is behind this law , " he said			0
" this shows the kingdom is really moving forward with enacting laws that protect its citizens and residents and to make sure the kingdom is now in accordance with international obligations and international standards regarding human rights			1
" earlier this year , a campaign was launched calling for an end to violence against women			0
in the @entity154 advert a woman wears a hijab with only her eyes visible - one clearly bruised and blackened			0
a slogan written in @entity159 underneath reads : " some things ca n't be covered			0
" @entity161 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 's cabinet has approved a law to combat domestic violence at home and in the workplace
human rights campaigners welcome decision , but urge caution as law is *unclear* and not implemented yet
until now , @entity4 has n't had a written law governing domestic violence
the law is expected to be implemented within 90 days , making physical abuse punishable with a maximum of one year in jail
