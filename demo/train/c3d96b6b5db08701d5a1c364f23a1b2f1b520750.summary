@entity0 -- it is a case at the intersection of science and finance , an evolving 21st century dispute that comes down to a simple question : should the government allow patents for human genes ? the @entity11 offered little other than confusion during oral arguments on monday on nine patents held by a @entity16 biotech firm			1
@entity17 isolated two related types of biological material , brca - 1 and @entity20 - 2 , linked to increased hereditary risk for breast and ovarian cancer			1
at issue is whether " products of nature " can be treated the same as " human - made " inventions , and held as the exclusive intellectual property of individuals and companies			1
a ruling is expected by late june			2
on one side , scientists and companies argue patents encourage medical innovation and investment that saves lives			1
on the other , patient rights groups and civil libertarians counter the patent holders are " holding hostage " the diagnostic care and access of information available to high - risk patients			1
how human genes become patented outside the court , several protesters held signs , such as " your corporate greed is killing my friends " and " my genes are not property			1
" the justices asked tough questions , raising a number of colorful hypotheticals to explore the boundaries of patent law , including whether things like baseball bats , leaves from exotic @entity67 plants , and the human liver could get federal government protection			1
" the patent law is filled with uneasy compromises , because on the one hand , we do want people to invent , " said justice @entity70			1
" on the other hand , we 're very worried about them tying up some kind of whatever it is , particularly a thing that itself could be used for further advance			2
" justice @entity83 noted @entity17 made a significant investment in time and money in its genetic " discoveries " and might be allowed to have two - decade control over the genes for research , diagnostics , and treatment			1
" i just do n't think we can decide the case on the ground : oh , do n't worry about investment , it 'll come " if there was no patent protection			1
but justice @entity99 used a " chocolate chip " cookie analogy to say merely isolating naturally derived products would normally not get you a patent , only for the particular process or use of the cookie			1
" if i combust those in some new way , i can get a patent on that , " she said			0
" but i ca n't imagine getting a patent simply on the basic items of salt , flour and eggs , simply because i 've created a new use or a new product from those ingredients			0
" the patent system was created more than two centuries ago with a dual purpose			0
one is to offer temporary financial incentives for those at the ground floor of innovative products like the combustible engine and the x-ray machine			1
the second is to ensure one company does not hold a lifetime monopoly that might discourage competition and consumer affordability			0
all patent submissions rely on a complex reading of applicable laws , distinguishing between abstract ideas and principles , and more tangible scientific discoveries and principles			0
medical science had traditionally shunned patents			1
a famous example cited in numerous briefs in the current appeal involved dr. @entity146 's development and invention of the polio oral vaccine in 1952			1
when his life - saving treatment was announced , he said the people would " own " the vaccine , adding " could you patent the sun ? " maybe not the sun , but in the past 31 years , 20 percent of the human genome has been protected under @entity157 patents			1
all sides agree the science of isolating the building blocks of life is no easy task			0
@entity17 has said it has spent several years and hundreds of millions of dollars in its research			1
since @entity17 owns the patent on breast cancer genes , it is the only company that can perform tests for potential abnormalities			1
an initial test catches most problems , but the company also offers a second , separate test , called @entity173 , to detect the rest , a diagnostic that can cost several thousand dollars			0
" we invest heavily in the research and development that is needed to discover and provide high - quality molecular diagnostic products that save and improve patients ' lives , '' said @entity177 , executive vice president and general counsel at @entity17			1
" strong intellectual property and patent rights in the @entity157 are critical to fulfilling our mission			1
" the company says 1 million patients have benefited from its @entity191 technology , and that about 250,000 such tests are performed yearly			0
and officials say the average out - of - pocket expense for the testing is only about $ 100 , a figure disputed by the plaintiffs			0
all sides agree too , the @entity200 testing has saved countless lives since it was first unveiled in 1996 , giving at - risk women the option of having their breasts removed as a preventive measure			2
but some patients have complained charging so much for a second test is " irresponsible , " and a sign the bio-tech company is more interested in profits than patient care for those unable to afford the second analysis			0
it is a charge the company strongly denies			0
among those challenging the @entity17 patents are sisters @entity219 and @entity221			1
@entity219 was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40			0
the initial @entity200 test proved negative , meaning her family members were not likely at risk			2
but @entity221 later developed ovarian cancer			0
the second @entity173 testing proved positive , meaning the siblings carry the cancer - causing mutation all along			0
" it could have prevented my cancer , or at least caught it early , " @entity221 told @entity1 's senior medical correspondent @entity232			0
" now my cancer is so advanced , i have only a 20 - percent chance of being alive five years from now			0
" money was not an issue for them , but @entity219 and @entity221 , along with a coalition of physician groups and genetic counselors say @entity17 has not made the @entity173 tests widely available for patients without a strong family history of these kinds of cancers			1
" @entity17 did not invent the human genes at issue in this case , " @entity246 of the @entity247 told the court at argument			1
he is representing the plaintiffs bring the initial lawsuit			0
" @entity17 deserves credit for having unlocked these secrets			1
@entity17 does not deserve a patent for it			1
" but several justices raised concerns			0
" isolating or extracting natural products has long been considered patentable , " said justice @entity261 , echoing what the company has argued - and won in lower courts			2
she offered examples like " aspirin and whooping cough vaccine			0
how is this different from those starting as natural products ? " justice @entity271 used the example of a newly discovered plant with " tremendous medicinal purposes			2
" " it 's not just the case of taking the leaf off the tree and chewing it " to treat breast cancer			2
" let 's say if you do that , you 'd have to eat a whole forest to get the value of this			0
but it 's extracted and reduced to a concentrated form			0
that 's not eligible for a patent ? " justices @entity290 and @entity292 put a financial spin on the question			2
" why would a company incur massive investment if it can not patent ? " an isolated gene , asked @entity292			2
when told by @entity246 that scientific " curiosity " or @entity300 recognition might be enough , @entity292 seemed unsatisfied			0
" well , that 's lovely , " he said somewhat sarcastically			0
on the other side @entity17 attorney @entity302 said " the parade of horribles " raised by the plaintiffs had not happened			1
" there 's no dispute in this case that there has been some alteration of the isolated dna molecules			1
" he said there has been an " explosion in biotechnology and the successful , economically successful , technologically successful , and life - saving industry that is at the heart of these inventions			0
" but @entity83 disputed @entity302 ' assertion this patent was deserved because of " different economic values " in cutting - edge genetic science -- and that patients did not have the " human ingenuity " of the @entity200 test before @entity17 developed it			1
" well , we could have said that with atomic energy , with electric , but so far the choice of the patent law was that we have a uniform rule for all industries , " @entity83 said			2
" that avoids giving special industries special subsidies , which is very important it seems to me			0
" chief justice @entity338 repeated the concerns of several colleagues , when saying the gene patents were much different from those for pharmaceuticals and other medical advances			2
" there , you 're obviously combining things and getting something new			0
here you 're just snipping [ the genetic line ] , and you do n't have anything new , you have something that is a part of something that has existed previous to your intervention			0
" the federal government is taking a somewhat middle ground : @entity355 itself is not patentable but so - called " cdna " can be			0
complementary dna is artificially synthesized from the genetic template , and engineered to produce gene clones			0
use of this protein - isolating procedure , known as " tagging , " is especially important in mapping and cataloguing the vast human genome			0
solicitor general @entity365 also suggested @entity366 could create exceptions in the genetic or bio-tech testing arena , over so - called " use " patents for specific procedures			2
the high court has addressed the broader issue before , and may use a 2012 decision to guide the current human gene case			2
in the so - called " @entity377 " case , the justices unanimously said patents could not be issued on observations of a natural phenomenon -- in this case a doctor 's medical diagnosis of a patient 's reaction to a drug			1
" if a law of nature is not patentable , than neither is a process reciting a law of nature , unless that process has additional features that provide practical assurance that the process is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the law of nature itself , " wrote @entity70 for the court in @entity377			1
the current case is @entity401 ( 12 - 398 ) .			2

oral arguments held on case involving nine patents held by biotech firm
@entity17 isolated two types of material linked to hereditary risk for two cancers
*conventional* patents are held as the exclusive intellectual property of the inventor
question is whether products of nature should be treated *similarly* under the law
