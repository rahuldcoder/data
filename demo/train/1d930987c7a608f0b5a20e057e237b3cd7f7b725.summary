@entity0 -- in the end , the @entity2 are keeping with tradition - as in the signature ' a ' that is the team 's logo			1
@entity8 posted a photo of the new navy blue batting practice caps with a red and white scripted ' @entity11 ' the team will wear those hats at spring training , which starts tuesday			1
the @entity2 said a decision on the batting caps had not been made yet when a potential design was leaked several weeks ago			1
that design drew ire for its " screaming @entity20 " logo			1
" i like the selection we made this year , " @entity2 president @entity21 said in a statement monday			2
" we had a variety of choices that we looked at , some more thoroughly than others			0
but at the end , we liked this one			0
" but writer @entity30 of @entity33 's @entity32 blog , who broke the news of the cap design in december , was n't buying the @entity2 ' statement			2
he suggested the @entity2 withdrew the design because of the furor it caused			2
" in other words , the @entity2 are claiming that they were never committed to the @entity20 head cap to begin with , " @entity30 wrote			1
" but that does n't ring true			0
" the indian head cap has been shown for months in the official @entity44 and is still shown there right now , " @entity30 wrote			0
" it 's also shown in the new @entity48 catalog			0
all signs indicate that the @entity2 fully intended to go with the @entity20 design until the recent controversy caused them to have second thoughts			1
that was certainly the reaction for some @entity56 , especially @entity58 groups that were highly critical of the screaming @entity20 logo			1
@entity60 , director of the @entity62 's @entity61 , said in december that the use of the screaming @entity20 logo would be going backward			1
" what this does is contribute to the casual racism native people are subjected to in our society , " said @entity60 , a member of the @entity64			0
the screaming @entity20 is an image of an imaginary @entity20 , @entity60 said			1
it and other stereotypical sports mascots , he said , do not portray @entity56 for who they truly are			2
the @entity20 was part of the @entity2 logo when the team moved to @entity0 from @entity78 in 1966			1
it was retired in 1989			0
the team also had a mascot , @entity81 ( knock a homer ) , who wore @entity58 dress and war paint			0
but not everyone agreed with the @entity2 ' decision			2
@ @entity88 posted this : " so disappointed the @ @entity2 are n't wearing the screaming @entity20 hats for spring training			1
you damn @entity92 won this time			0
" @ @entity94 said : " sick and tired of this @entity96 culture we live in where everybody is afraid to hurt anybody 's feelings			0
the " screaming @entity20 " logo is n't racist ... " others just wanted a piece of the controversy : @ mattplanet said : " okay , so we all know some prototypes of that screaming indian @entity2 @entity109 cap were made ... somebody got to get us one ... " debate over sports mascots is , of course , not new			1
@entity116 professional and collegiate sports teams have used @entity58 logos and names for years			0
@entity120 's @entity92 , for instance , continue to feature a smiling @entity20 dubbed @entity121 , criticized as a racist caricature			2
sometimes this happens with the blessing of native american tribes , and other times -- like with the @entity128 's @entity127 , a term that many feel advances a demeaning stereotype -- they have been denounced as racial slurs .			0

the @entity2 had *reportedly* considered using a ' screaming @entity20 ' logo on batting practice caps
the logo drew ire from @entity56 as being *offensive*
the @entity2 are now using a navy blue cap with the scripted ' a ' logo
