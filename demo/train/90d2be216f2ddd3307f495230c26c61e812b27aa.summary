in designating the @entity1 as a foreign terrorist organization and an offshoot of @entity4 in @entity5 , the @entity0 has put flesh on the bones of its policy of discriminating between the " bad " @entity10 rebels and the " good " ones			1
but the decision is getting mixed reviews in @entity14			2
rebels in brigades fighting around @entity17 have told @entity18 that the move is a miscalculation			0
their argument goes something like this : " the @entity24 and the @entity25 in general have given us next to no help while we 've witnessed thousands die at the hands of @entity32 's heavy weaponry and dominance of the skies			2

we may not share @entity1 's worldview , but we need their organizational and battlefield experience			1
" this has translated into resentment and anger toward the @entity24 on the ground , as people ask : " @entity1 are terrorists , but @entity32 is not ? " for the @entity24 , the decision is part of a broader effort to support a moderate political opposition in @entity14 -- one that can be part of an eventual transition to a @entity14			1

additionally there is concern among @entity24 officials that groups like @entity1 will make common cause with @entity76 militants in @entity5 , who would like nothing better than a sympathetic rear base across the @entity79			1
@entity24 officials are making the argument that the overall affect of the designation of @entity1 will be to minimize the group 's role in the @entity10 opposition while not reducing the fighting capabilities of the rebel groups			1
" @entity1 is one of many groups that are fighting the @entity10 regime now , it is not the only one , " a senior administration official told reporters tuesday in explaining the designation			1
" in fact it is a minority			0
its influence has grown in recent months , but it still represents the minority element within the broader armed opposition			0
" by the estimates of rebel commanders in @entity14 , @entity1 ( also known as @entity1 ) makes up less than 10 % of the brigades fighting the regime			1
most of its fighters are @entity10			2
some waged jihad in @entity5 before returning home , though several also spent time in the @entity109 prison camp in @entity5 , where hundreds of insurgents were held			0
there is also more than a smattering of foreign fighters in @entity1 's ranks -- @entity115 , @entity5 , @entity116 , a few from @entity118			1
@entity24 officials also point out that the @entity0 has designated @entity10 groups known as the @entity120 -- paramilitary militias controlled by the government of @entity10 president @entity32 that have attacked and killed opponents of the @entity32 regime			1
" whether the @entity24 steps today will immediately curtail @entity1 's capabilities , i do n't think they know , " the senior administration official said			1
" but i think that other nations that are involved in helping the armed opposition will now take more seriously our concerns about the @entity1			2
" @entity0 spokeswoman @entity132 said monday : " we 've had concerns that @entity1 is little more than a front for @entity4 in @entity5 who has moved some of its operations into @entity14			1
... we do see @entity4 in @entity5 trying to make these inroads			2
" some tribal leaders in @entity5 provinces like @entity141 are already thought to be funneling money and weapons to @entity145 factions across the long border , and @entity1 has been strong in areas near the @entity5 border			2

they are well represented in the new @entity158 established this week , from which @entity1 was excluded			2
@entity1 had already boycotted the new political opposition , making common cause with other militant factions			1
some analysts believe that @entity1 is too important on the battlefield , especially in attacking military bases in the @entity166 , for other rebel commanders to ostracize it			2
in the year since @entity1 emerged , it has carried out a number of complex and coordinated suicide bombings against high - profile regime targets and built a coherent fighting force through a thorough vetting process			2
by the admission of @entity177 commanders on the ground , @entity1 was instrumental in the seizure of the @entity180 near @entity17 this week			0
a reporter for @entity182 in the area said many of the fighters " were from other @entity185 countries and @entity118			0
" at another military base , rebel commander @entity188 told @entity18 that fighters with @entity1 were among the three brigades laying siege to the military academy			0
he said they were responsible for the most dangerous area			0
the group has continued its offensive against the regime with a devastating series of suicide bombings -- most recently claiming responsibility for blowing up a government checkpoint in @entity203 , and posting before and after photographs on jihadist online forums			0
the analysts say that only if @entity24 designation of @entity1 were followed by serious weapons supplies to the " good " rebels might those rebels change their stance toward the group			1
while president @entity214 has not ruled out the option of supplying weapons , officials say there first must be more clarity on the ground			0
" for us , providing arms has to be done in a way that helps promote a political solution , " the senior administration official said			0
" until we understand how these arms promote a political solution , we do not see how provision of arms is a good idea			0
" not much is known about @entity1 's structure or leadership , but its emir , who goes by the @entity233 of of @entity234 , said in an audio message at the beginning of the year that its goal was to make @entity14 an @entity152 state			1
the group 's propaganda frequently tells @entity10 that they have been " abandoned " by the @entity25			2
the lesson of history is that revolutions tend to be won by the best organized and most ruthless , rather than the best intentioned and most reasonable			0
for @entity245 and the @entity246 , organization was as important as ideology			0
the @entity248 swept across @entity249 as the only coherent force in a country craving order and stability			0
@entity255 's revolution ended up favoring the @entity154 as the only political organization tried and tested by decades of repression			0
similarly , @entity1 stands out among @entity10 rebel groups as the most effective and disciplined			1
@entity1 has also learned from history , according to other @entity152 among @entity10 rebel ranks			1
many of its more experienced fighters saw @entity4 in @entity5 alienate the @entity76 tribes there with its vicious sectarian bloodletting			0
as @entity267 of the @entity268 wrote in @entity269 last week , " @entity1 seems to have learned from the mistakes of @entity4 in @entity5 : it has not attacked civilians randomly , nor has it shown wanton disregard for human life by publicizing videos showing the beheading of its enemies			1
" instead , @entity145 leaders in @entity17 say , it is looking to broaden its appeal and spread its fundamentalist message			0
ordinary people in @entity17 complain that some @entity177 units mishandle or misappropriate bread distribution , and they have begun to look to @entity145 groups for greater honesty in managing local affairs			0
one chant recently heard in @entity17 , revealingly , was this : " we do n't want a thieving free army , we want an @entity152 army			0
" the @entity24 would rather see that role in the hands of the @entity293 , present in many @entity10 cities since early in the uprising			1
such is the undercurrent of resentment toward the @entity24 among @entity10 pummeled by nearly two years of regime attacks that designating @entity1 may have the unintended consequence of making it more popular			1
designation may also make it more attractive to foreign jihadists			0
according to the @entity305 , another jihadist group , the @entity304 , has already congratulated @entity1 for its designation , describing it as a " great honor " and calling on other groups to rally to @entity1			0
for now , the group has no formal affiliation with @entity4 , and according to other @entity145 fighters it is probably wary of being pigeonholed as part of the group , for fear of causing a backlash among a population that historically is among the less conservative in the @entity185 world			0
one leading @entity145 in @entity17 described @entity1 as similar to jihadist groups in @entity5 before they morphed into @entity4			1
so far , he said , @entity1 has yet to receive @entity4 's seal of approval			1
the @entity0 thinks otherwise .			0

@entity0 has added @entity1 in @entity14 to its list of terrorist organizations
some @entity10 rebels object , saying @entity1 's *expertise* is needed in fight against regime
the @entity24 wants to build up a moderate political opposition for a future @entity14
@entity1 says it wants @entity14 to be an @entity152 state , but it 's not formally linked to @entity4
