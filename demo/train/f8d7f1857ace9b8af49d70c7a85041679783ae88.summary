the @entity0 is the only time of year @entity4 's army of migrant workers gets to go home			1
known as " chunyun , " the annual travel crush is the world 's largest migration of humans			0
the lengths workers go to to see their families during the country 's biggest holiday , which this year began february 19 , is one facet of migrant worker life captured by factory hand turned photographer , @entity21			1
for more than a decade , @entity21 was himself one of @entity4 's 250 - million strong " floating population " of migrant workers			1
originally from the rural , inland province of @entity25 , he worked as a security guard in the factories that surround the southern boom town of @entity29 , over a thousand kilometers away			0
now a professional photographer , he trains his camera lens on those he left behind			2
" i have lived this life , " he says			1
" so i know exactly what their situations are			2
" for the past 10 years , he has photographed workers in eight factories in @entity39 , a factory town near @entity29 , documenting their life on and off the assembly lines			1
the scenes @entity21 has captured range from the bizarre to the intimate			1
in one electronics factory , workers resembling astronauts -- their protective clothing only reveals their eyes -- take a quick nap			1
but he also shows a life where strong friendships are forged -- at a dormitory dinner party for example			2
he 's taken more than 400,000 photos and they 've been been exhibited across the country			0
but he did n't go to any of the exhibitions			0
" i did n't have the travel expenses , " he says			0
in november , he published a book called " i 'm a @entity59 , " a compilation of writing and more than 150 photos			0
@entity63 captures biggest human migration on earth @entity21 started taking photos for an internal factory publication in 2002			1
he then took vocational classes			0
when he returned to his hometown for the @entity0 celebrations , he found photos a better way than words to describe life in the factory to his mother and mother - in - law			2
yet it was a deeper feeling of insecurity that drove him to keep documenting the life of migrant workers - a turbulent life over which they have little control			1
" sometimes , you want to jump ship for better pay at another factory shortly after starting your current job , " @entity21 says			1
" yet at other times when you want to stay on and settle down , you get fired or the factory gets taken over			0
" if photography meant self - fulfillment for @entity21 in the early days , it is now more of a mission			2
he says the more photos he takes , the more deeply he understands the issues migrants face			0
@entity21 says he is particularly concerned about the plight of children left behind by parents			2
restrictions on housing , education and healthcare , make it hard for migrant workers to bring along their kids and they are often raised by grandparents , relatives or neighbors			1
" the parents have devoted their lives to the manufacturing industry , but they barely get anything			0
now their kids start entering the sad cycle			0
" despite his success , @entity21 thinks himself no different to a migrant worker and says the feeling of uneasiness from that time will never fade			1
" i feel like rootless duckweed on a strange land			0
" in pictures : @entity0			0
