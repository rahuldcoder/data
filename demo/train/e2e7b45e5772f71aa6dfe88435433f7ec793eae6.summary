-- @entity1 is a powerhouse of ingenuity , patenting ideas as soon as an engineer can scratch them down on paper ( or @entity6 )			1
around three dozen @entity1 patents made their way through the @entity9 this week alone			1
here we share three of the most notable -- one helps prevent cracked cover glass , another would deliver power to multiple devices with just a single adapter , and a third is a far - reaching location - based services patent that could keep @entity1 's competitors on their toes			1
first off , @entity1 has come up with a solution for keeping the glass on the back of your @entity22 from breaking in the event of a fall			1
obviously , the simplest solution would be to avoid glass screens altogether , but if glass is going to stay , it should be made more resilient			1
@entity1 dreamed up a tunable shock mount that would sit between the glass and the body of the device			1
this shock mount would inflate when the device 's accelerometer senses that the phone or tablet is falling			1
an actuator within the device would suck in the cover glass as it accelerates toward earth , protecting it from damage			2
this technology could also be used to provide a water - tight seal			0
the patent also describes using alumino silicate glass , better known as @entity48 , instead of normal glass			2
@entity48 is already used in the @entity50 and @entity51			0
future cover glass could be chemically treated in a solution including potassium to help strengthen it further			0
as k + ions replace na + ions on the surface and edges of the glass , the glass would have higher compression thresholds in those areas , making it less susceptible to cracking			0
next up , @entity1 proposed an intelligent power adapter that could detect the varied power needs of different devices , and service them simultaneously			1
today 's power adapters typically convert @entity69 current from a wall outlet to a single @entity72 current that can be fed to your device			1
because different devices have different power needs , you currently need a different cable for each new gadget you use			0
( well , that 's the main reason			0
if power cords and adapters were universally interchangeable , manufacturers would n't be able to reap additional revenue when these accessories eventually need to be replaced			0
) @entity1 's patent details an adapter that would have multiple , daisy - chained @entity72 - to - @entity72 converters ( either in the adapter itself , or the cord or a connector ) , supplying power to more than one device			1
alternatively , the adapter would have a relay that dynamically controls the power delivered to a device , and would only deliver juice to compatible devices			0
the third major patent that rolled through the @entity9 this week was innovative back when it was first filed by @entity100 in 1998			2
the patent involves location - based services , and could potentially be another tool @entity1 could use to crush other mobile competition ( or at least get them to pony up some royalties )			1
@entity1 acquired this patent in 2009 from @entity100 , and on tuesday the patent was reissued			2
the patent predates the mobile app revolution , and even the rise of major social networks , and is worded uncomfortably broadly			0
here 's the bulk of what it says : " a location information system that displays location specific information , the location information system , comprising : a receiver that receives location identification information from at least one site specific object identifying a @entity124 , where the at least one site specific object is a @entity127			2
; and a transceiver that transmits the location identification information to a distributed network and that receives the location specific information about the specified location from the distributed network based on the location identification information , wherein the location specific information provides information corresponding to the location			2
" yes , patentese is an obtuse dialect , but if you could decipher any of the above , you 'll know the patent describes what tons of apps and mobile devices already do on a near constant basis			0
@entity1 could , theoretically , start pursuing companies like @entity147 or @entity148 for performing location - based services that fall under the patent 's very wide umbrella			1
is this patent really a threat to such companies ? " @entity1 gets interesting new patents all the time			1
i think this one is an example , but the moment of truth for any patent or patent portfolio is litigation , " @entity156 ' @entity156 told @entity157 over email			0
in other words : do n't get your panties in a wad until @entity1 starts aggressively wielding its patent power in the courts			2
for now , it 's just something the company has got in the bag			0

one of @entity1 's most recent patents helps protect glass screens by using a shock mount
another patent filed by @entity1 is for an adapter for multiple @entity72 - to - @entity72 converters
a third patent involves the use of location - based services
