@entity0 , @entity1 -- one of the abducted boys featured in the viral video demanding the capture of infamous warlord @entity6 is now a man and says the time for justice has arrived			1
@entity10 , now 21 , revisited the village where he was abducted by @entity6 's @entity12 to tell why @entity6 's crimes should not be forgotten			1
his story has touched millions since it was featured in " @entity15 , " a video from the @entity18 charity that created a global online buzz and renewed public interest in capturing @entity6			1
critics have questioned the film 's accuracy and warned that it oversimplified the situation in @entity1			2
@entity6 first unleashed his fury in eastern @entity27 more than two decades ago and is wanted for crimes against humanity by the @entity30			2
the @entity12 terrorized @entity1 in a brutal campaign against the government and civilian population			0
since 2006 , when it was pushed out of northern @entity1 , it has largely operated in the @entity34 and @entity35			0
invisible children aimed to make @entity6 a household name and drum up global support to end the murders , rapes , abductions and other abuses committed by the @entity12			1
@entity10 -- sitting a few meters from where he was abducted -- told @entity2 : " whenever a brother is in a problem , whenever anybody is in a problem , it should get the attention of everyone in the world			1
" it has been going on for the last 26 years			0
it shows that we are failing to solve it			0
and if there are any means that someone can help and it goes to end , then why not @entity57 get involved			0
" for me the criticism [ of " @entity15 " ] is unfair , because if i am to say it is fair then i would n't be here			0
right now i would n't have been able to go to school			0
you would n't have been able to speak to me right now because i had no hope in my life			0
i reached even a point when i said , ' i can even die now ' because i thought it would be the immediate resolution of my suffering , you know			0
" @entity10 's home was @entity76 , a small dusty village -- a handful of circular huts off the main north - south road			1
there is little more than a track through the village and the occasional cockerel wanders from hut to hut			0
as @entity10 squatted down on the edge of @entity0 he said he has watched an earlier version of the @entity6 film , but added " it brings [ back ] a lot of memories			1
sometimes i get sad when i watch it			0

@entity10 said his brother tried to escape the @entity12 but was captured and executed			1
it was the sight of his brother being killed that made @entity10 realize he had no choice but to try to escape			1
he managed to reach the town of @entity105 , about 11 kilometers ( 7 miles ) from his village , and a shelter where he found safety			1
now , after more than five years of peace in @entity1 many wonder if the online movie highlighting @entity6 's crimes is too late			2
@entity10 is now chasing the childhood ambition he thought was lost forever -- studying law in @entity1 's capital , @entity116			2
he says the @entity12 has left his village but justice must be done .			1

a man abducted as a boy by the @entity12 says it 's time to bring its leader @entity6 to justice
