@entity0 , @entity1 -- another day , another apology from @entity0 mayor @entity5 , this time for crude comments about oral sex he made thursday morning			1
but by afternoon , he had a television show			1
the day started with @entity9 -- who admitted last week that he had smoked crack cocaine in a " drunken stupor " about a year ago -- facing explosive new allegations of drunkenness , drug use and the verbal and physical abuse of aides			1
in the course of answering the allegations , he denied a female staffer 's allegation that he sought to perform oral sex with graphic language of his own , stunning the reporters who surrounded him			1
soon afterward , his wife at his side , @entity9 went back before reporters to say he had been under " tremendous , tremendous stress " and was getting unspecified support from " a team of health care professionals			2
" but he called the latest allegations " 100 % lies			0
" " when you attack my integrity as a father and as a husband , i see red			1
today i acted on complete impulse in my remarks , " @entity5 said			2
he took no questions from reporters , who shouted sharp inquiries at him as he entered the office			0
" mayor @entity5 , why should we believe you ? why would you subject your family to this ? " one asked			1
" what 's the matter with you , mr. mayor ? " another said			2
the @entity55 voted 37 - 5 on wednesday to ask @entity9 to take a leave of absence , and most members turned their backs on him when he addressed their thursday meeting			1
@entity9 's brother @entity61 , a city council member , is urging him to take a leave of absence , a council source told @entity2 on condition of anonymity			1
the source did not want to be identified			0
the city council , meanwhile , has scheduled a special meeting on monday to consider a motion to delegate duties not assigned by statute to the mayor			2
if approved , the motion would strip @entity9 of most of his duties			2
among other things the motion calls for reallocating the operating budget of the office of the mayor to the city clerk , according the council 's agenda published online			2
but in a new twist , @entity1 's @entity83 announced that @entity9 and his brother @entity61 will begin hosting their own tv show on monday			1
the show , " @entity90 , " picks up where the two brothers left off on a talk radio show that ended its run last week , the network said on its website			1
a headline on that site posed the question , " @entity1 's @entity99 ? " and it quoted @entity101 saying , " @entity5 is like @entity102 or @entity103 " and " you just never know what he is going to say			1
" " mayor @entity5 seems to be in a no - holds - barred mode , " the network said			1
" there is no filter			0
there is no careful treading			0
" critics of @entity83 have described its conservatism as " @entity83 , " according to a story about its launch in 2011 by the @entity117			0
@entity9 also recently confessed to having purchased illegal drugs in the past two years , while he was in office			2
but he has steadfastly refused to step down , saying the voters of @entity1 's largest city should decide his fate in 2014			1
the latest allegations surfaced wednesday in more than 500 pages of court documents that police used to get a search warrant for @entity130 , @entity5 's friend and occasional driver , whom police accuse of marijuana possession and trafficking			1
@entity9 responded thursday morning by threatening legal action against former staffers who claimed the mayor brought a woman appearing to be an escort to his office and drank alcohol while driving			1
the documents include police interviews with former staff members , information obtained from surveillance crews and cameras , and even an examination of the mayor 's garbage			1
several staffers said they were asked to buy alcohol for the mayor of @entity1 's largest city			1
one incident described by a former staffer alleged that @entity9 , while driving , stopped the vehicle , guzzled some vodka , and drove on			2
none of the allegations against @entity9 has been substantiated by investigators , and @entity9 faces no criminal charges			2
@entity5 called the allegations " outright lies " and told reporters , " i 'm sure none of you have never gotten behind the wheel after taking a drink			0
" on thursday , @entity5 also said the so - called " escort " was n't a prostitute but a family friend			0
he added that such allegations " hurt my wife			0
" " it makes me sick , " he added			0
" i 've had enough			0
" according to the documents , @entity9 's former press secretary , @entity175 , said women often came to the mayor 's office , " and told staffers that they have smoked a joint with the mayor on the street outside of the bar			1
these women were told by the mayor that they could have a job			0
" @entity175 would then have to interview these women and try to talk them out of a job			0
in a @entity2 interview thursday evening , @entity0 police chief @entity190 declined comment on the investigation			0
" it is a difficult situation for the city of @entity0 and for our citizens , but we 're working our way through it , " @entity190 said			0
ontario premier @entity200 said thursday she was disturbed by recent events involving the @entity0 mayor , and while it 's not the province 's role to impose its preferences on a city 's government , the province would respond and provide new tools to the @entity55 if it indicated it needs help to carry out its duties , @entity200 said			0
if so , she would consult other parties to see what could be done so partisan politics would n't be involved , she said			0
@entity2 's @entity216 and @entity217 reported from @entity0 , and @entity218 reported and wrote from @entity219			0
@entity2 's @entity220 and @entity221 contributed to this report			0
