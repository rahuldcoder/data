-- high in the @entity2 , where it 's so dry and cold that very little vegetation grows , life depends on one animal : the alpaca			1
but in recent years , raising alpacas has become a greater challenge			2
mountains that used to be covered with ice around the town of @entity12 , elevation of 4,200 meters ( about 13,780 feet ) above sea level , are now barren			1
@entity15 , a 30 - year - old @entity16 shepherd who lives in @entity12 , says that no ice means no water ; and no water means no grass to feed the animals			1
@entity15 also says the ice has all but disappeared in the last three decades			1
" the difference is that when i was a little boy , the mountaintops were white with snow and ice			1
but as you can see , they now look black			2
that 's the difference , " he says			0
read more coverage of the road to @entity32 a stranger recently arrived in @entity34 bringing hope			0
@entity36 , an engineer and self - described inventor , is the founder of @entity39 glaciers			1
the organization 's goal is to bring the ice back to the mountains			1
" this community is closely tied to the glaciers , " he says			1
" as soon as they disappear , their livelihood disappears for them as well			0
" along with @entity50 and his crew of five locals , photographer @entity54 and i travel to the top of the mountains			2
the lack of oxygen makes the hike challenging			0
at an elevation of 5,000 meters ( about 16,400 feet ) , we see firsthand what 's happening to the glaciers			2
this is where @entity50 and his crew are working on the project to bring the glaciers back			1
@entity50 's idea is very simple : if dark mountains absorb more heat from the sun , white mountains will have the opposite effect			1
the solution is to make them white			1
under @entity50 's direction , the crew of five goes around the mountain , splashing a mixture that turns the rocks white			1
it 's not paint , but a combination of water , sand and lime			2
two percent of the mixture is soap , which makes it stick to the rocks and stay waterproof once it dries			1
an infrared thermometer shows a difference of 30 degrees @entity95 ) in temperature between the dark rocks and the previously whitened ones			1
@entity50 acknowledges there is a lot of work to go before he can prove his theory works			0
" this is an experiment			0
it may or may not work			0
or it may work a little			0
doing something about it is better than nothing at all , " he says			0
and it seems to be working			0
@entity50 shows us a crevice between the rocks where he finds some ice			1
the locals say there was no ice at all before			2
" we had very little water			2
the difference this year since we have whitened the mountain is that there 's water			1
as you can see down there , there 's a well with plenty of water , and down the hill we have even more , " says @entity15 , the shepherd			2
glaciers are crucial not only for this mountain region			1
they are also natural dams for all of @entity39 from which water flows to streams and rivers in downhill valleys			2
glaciers also decrease the temperature			1
so far , the crew has covered an area of roughly 15,000 square meters ( almost the size of three football fields ) , still too small to determine if @entity50 's idea will work in the long term			2
his goal is to cover 3 billion square meters , which would be much more than 500,000 football fields			0
for that , he would need about $ 1.5 billion spread over five years			0
he 's received an award from the @entity153 to work on the project , but only enough for a modest beginning			0
" if there 's a chance of bringing change , why ignore it ? doing nothing would be worse			0
if we fail to act , life will end in this area , " @entity36 says			0
in a way , life has already ended in the town of @entity12			0
@entity50 says that only about 900 people remain in a place that thousands used to call home			0
but @entity15 says he 's confident the project will work in the long term			0
he 's betting his children 's future on it .			0

mountains in @entity2 andes that used to be covered with ice are now barren
mountain communities that depend on water from glaciers are *threatened*
engineer and self - described inventor wants to bring ice back to the mountains
his solution : a mixture that turns mountain rocks white , lowers their temperature
