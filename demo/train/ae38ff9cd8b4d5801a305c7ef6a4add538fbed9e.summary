-- when your toddler is hurt and screaming and emotions are bubbling over , it can be hard to tell if a situation is a true emergency , something that can be treated in your doctor 's office or an issue you can handle at home			1
" it 's always better to call the pediatrician before going to the @entity13 for anything but life - threatening emergencies , " says @entity12 , a pediatric @entity13 doctor and author of " if your @entity16 , @entity15			1
" we spoke to pediatric @entity13 doctors about the most common accidents and whether your child 's doctor will deal with the issue over the phone , have you come into the office or call the er to alert them that your child is on the way			1
what if your baby pulls up on the coffee table and then yanks a mug of hot tea on herself ? @entity37 to the @entity13 if the burn covers a large part of her body ; if it 's on her face , hands , feet or genitals ; or if it 's a third - degree burn , which is pretty unlikely from a hot beverage			1
otherwise , treat her at home and act fast			1
since the first thing to do is get the hot liquid off the body , dr. @entity45 recommends removing the wet clothing and plunking her into a cool shower			1
" if it 's only a small part of the hand or arm that 's been burned , " she says , " running cool water over the limb in the sink for 10 to 15 minutes or until the pain subsides will stop further injury and provide immediate pain relief			1
" keep the area in water until it 's cool to the touch , then treat the burn			1
at - home burn basics if she has a first - degree burn ( the skin is red ) , follow these tips : do : after the burn has cooled , cover it loosely with a dry bandage or clean cloth			2
do n't : apply ointments ( or butter )			2
this could cause infection or trap heat and make the burn deeper			2
do not break any blisters			2
this could allow bacteria into the wound			1
what if your toddler topples off his changing table ? the goose egg is huge , and he 's hysterical			2
@entity37 to the @entity13 ? for kids older than 12 months , you can take a watch - and - wait approach			1
dr. @entity45 says most kids who bump their heads are fine , and the size of the bump rarely has anything to do with the extent of the injury			1
there are loads of blood vessels in the head and face , so the swelling can be dramatic			2
keep an eye on him for the next few hours to make sure he does n't limp or favor one arm , vomit or become unusually sleepy or especially irritable			1
if you see any of these signs , call the doctor as they could mean something more serious			2
and , of course , if your child is motionless or unconscious or refuses to move after his fall , call an ambulance right away			2
the exception : dr. @entity45 says any child under a year of age who experiences more than a minor bump should always be checked out by a physician because injuries are harder to detect when the patient ca n't talk			1
