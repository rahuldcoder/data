@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity5 died alone in july at age 72 , the coroner 's office could not find any next of kin			1
similarly , @entity8 was listed as indigent -- no survivors and no funds for a funeral -- when he died at age 69			1
and yet a small army of men and women gathered to pay their respects to the two men , both @entity19 veterans , as they were buried at @entity20 in september			1
@entity21 , who works in the @entity23 coroner 's office , was instrumental in making sure the men got the honors they deserved			1
" she worked very hard to see that they were veterans ... and without that ... we probably would not be here today to honor them , " said @entity26 , founder and chairwoman of @entity28 , a local organization that makes sure veterans receive a respectful service at @entity20			1
the coroner 's office also discovered that @entity5 , a former staff sergeant , had been awarded the @entity35 for wounds received in @entity37			1
@entity8 was a former airman second class			0
" without [ @entity42 's ] persistence , these two individuals would be placed in a county - owned site , " said @entity39 , director of the @entity20			1
" nobody would have known			0
... nobody would have any concept of who these individuals were			0
" @entity50 , who served in the @entity51 in @entity37 in 1951 and was awarded the @entity35 and a @entity53 medal for bravery , helped spread the word about the double funeral			1
" the folks at the coroner 's office are patriotic @entity59 , " @entity50 said			1
" we got on the phone and on the @entity61 and invited our friends			0
" news of the funeral even made the local paper			1
" i really did n't know there would be this many people to come out , " @entity26 said			0
and come they did , civilians and veterans			1
an awning built to shade mourners from the hot @entity73 was not big enough to cover everyone			0
a few brought umbrellas for shade			0
many held @entity79 flags , some small and some very large and carried on poles			2
some brought flowers ; one vet held a few yellow roses ; another left a bouquet of red , white and blue flowers with a simple message printed on a white ribbon : " thank you			0
" when the honor guard approached with @entity5 's flag - draped casket , civilians put their hands over their hearts			1
the veterans -- some wearing motorcycle leather and bandanas , some sport shirts and slacks , others donning the suit jackets and pea caps favored by the @entity105 -- stood at attention and snapped crisp salutes			2
they saluted again when the honor guard fired three volleys of seven shots and when the lone bugler played taps			0
as the guard tightly folded the flag that draped @entity5 's casket , a woman in her 20s took cell phone video with one hand and wiped tears with the other			2
@entity5 's ceremony was brief , not much longer than 10 minutes			2
@entity8 's ceremony started shortly after , his ashes carried by the honor guard in a small wooden box			1
it lasted about as long as the first , with the same volley of shots , taps and salutes			0
the sergeant of the guard gave @entity5 's folded flag to @entity26			2
@entity23 sheriff @entity135 , who also serves as the county coroner , received @entity8 's flag			1
in the minutes between services , cemetery director @entity39 asked the crowd whether there were " any family representatives here for mr. @entity8 ? " no one came forward			0
" there were 125 , give or take , people here who had no idea who ... @entity5 or @entity8 were , " @entity39 said			0
" they did n't know if they were @entity79 , @entity149 , @entity150			0
they did n't even know they were in the @entity19			1
" " they 're patriotic @entity59 , and they showed up , " @entity50 added			0
" i knew their names and their rank , and that 's all i knew , " @entity26 said			2
" and yet , i was here , and i was very proud to be here , and spend a little time saying goodbye			0
... nobody deserves to be laid to rest alone , especially for fighting for their country , and ... they deserve the respect			0
" @entity20 is far different than any county facility where the indigent would be interred			1
in the arid foothills of @entity1 , their upright headstones will stand in a field of decomposed granite instead of grass , joining about 250 others in an orderly formation			1
the granite is raked daily , giving the new cemetery a zen garden look amid the rolling hills and century - old oak trees			2
@entity8 and @entity5 's cases should not be unusual , @entity39 said			2
and because they are veterans , they 're entitled to be here , and we honor them the very best way we can			2
" " i think we 're going to see more ... people identified as veterans from the ranks of the indigent , " @entity50 said			0
" they should be honored in a fitting way , like we honored these two today			0
" between @entity5 and @entity193 's services , @entity135 addressed the crowd : " because you may be indigent , it does n't make you inconsequential			1
they served our country , and you 're paying them a great tribute by being here			0

two @entity19 veterans died in @entity1 without any next of kin
local coroner 's official helped make sure the men got *military* burials
