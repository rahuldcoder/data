you 'd be hard - pressed to find someone who does n't own a t - shirt ; in fact , the ubiquitous garment is a mainstay in most wardrobes			1
nevertheless , @entity7 and @entity8 have injected new life into the plain white " tee " with @entity11 , a t - shirt store based in @entity12 , @entity13			1
bright prints , sharp slogans and youthful energy characterize @entity11 's alternative approach to fashion , where everyday @entity13 life inspires each new design			1
" the concept of @entity11 came up in and around 2009 , " @entity8 recalls			2
" we felt like there were n't really any products or apparel in the market that really celebrated the local experience , " she adds			2
following its successful launch on @entity29 , @entity11 eventually evolved into a bricks - and - mortar retailer , growing a loyal and enthusiastic customer base since the store 's opening in january 2014			1
despite the seemingly globalized nature of the fashion world , @entity11 's success is largely inspired by regional quirks and local collaborations rather than the latest throwaway trend			1
" the t - shirts that we design are in theme with life in @entity13 , things that we come across , statements , food , and people , " says @entity7			2
" we also have a line that 's called ' @entity50 ' where we invite people to submit their designs and if they go through the approval process then they get printed , " she says			2
having recently received the @entity54 from the @entity55 , @entity11 has firmly cemented itself as one to watch			0
however , the practicalities of producing and manufacturing locally - made clothing has proven to be just as difficult as they had anticipated			0
" it would 've been much easier to source our t - shirts in @entity63 , it would be much easier to get our stationery produced in @entity65 , but we had to kind of stick to what we started with and that has been difficult , " says @entity7			0
currently , all of @entity11 's products are made and sourced in various @entity73 countries -- with blank t - shirts sent in from factories in @entity13 , @entity76 and @entity77 to be printed in - house			1
ink , zips and embellishments , however , are mostly sourced from outside the continent , but the company aims to ensure that all components are 100 % @entity73 - made in the future			0
this commitment to homegrown design is part of a greater ambition to support local and regional industry , the entrepreneurs say , and so far , consumers have been taking note			0
@entity7 adds : " one of the things that makes definition what it is , is that the products are supposed to be entirely @entity73 in subject matter and as well as where the material comes from			0

@entity11 is a *booming* t - shirt retailer based in @entity12 , @entity13
@entity13 life is *key* inspiration for the brand 's bright and *stylish* designs
all products are manufactured locally , with the aim of supporting local and regional makers
