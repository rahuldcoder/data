-- four days , 12 stages , 175 acts , 700 acres of land -- the @entity4 is thriving in its tenth year			1
having been deemed @entity6 's glastonbury by the music industry -- the highest accolade in the festival world -- @entity4 will attract more than 80,000 people to @entity11 , @entity12 , beginning thursday			1
the small city , between @entity14 and @entity15 , has been home to the festival since its summer 2002 debut			2
it 's hard to believe the all - encompassing music festival came to be from an office in a @entity23 dive bar called @entity24 and @entity25 's			1
" very humble beginnings , " @entity4 and @entity27 presents co-founder @entity26 said			1
since then , the festival has evolved into a complete musical experience : drawing from indie rock , hip - hop , jazz , bluegrass and more , today , a more mainstream @entity4 continues to honor the spirit the festival was founded on a decade ago , @entity26 added			1
@entity37 , the managing editor of @entity38 , says @entity27 and @entity40 , the production and marketing teams behind @entity4 , achieve the perfect balance by featuring headliners like @entity44 and @entity4 veteran @entity45 alongside jam bands like @entity48 and the legendary classic rockers that make up @entity50			1
some people might criticize the mainstream shift , but , @entity26 says , " if we just kept doing the same thing , we probably would n't be relevant right now			2
" and with tickets costing about $ 240 , it 's important that @entity4 maintain its relevance -- especially in a time when people are wary of paying full price for individual shows			1
" so much music today is experienced on a computer screen that it 's really great to get out and experience it , " @entity61 said			2
people are used to listening to an eclectic mix of artists and styles on their portable media players , which is why the musical sampling that @entity4 offers is so appreciated			1
in addition to featuring different types of music and countless activities -- from yoga classes to the use of a 175 - foot - long inflatable water slide -- festivals are considered to be a great value for the average concert - goer			0
" festivals have been one of the few bright spots in the music industry in the past few years , " said @entity80 , @entity81 's senior editor			2
with a silent disco , a comedy theater , cinema , @entity89 and restaurants covering @entity11 's grounds , the relatively unknown city is transformed into a unique destination			1
for festival - goers , it 's not uncommon for people to have completely different experiences during the course of the long weekend			1
and it 's not just for the attendees			2
many artists would rather perform in front of thousands of people , interacting with other talent rather than playing a solo show , @entity80 said " you 're isolated when you 're on tour , going from city to city , " she added			0
" at a festival , you can interact with other artists , be inspired by them and feed off the crowd			0
" location , @entity61 said , is another seller for the festival			0
it 's centrally located and easy to get to			0
that could be why other festivals , such as @entity117 , which was held in the @entity119 village of the same name , struggled to stay afloat			0
meanwhile , the @entity122 , which takes place in @entity124 , @entity125 , is doing so well , it recently added another weekend to its 2012 schedule			0
perhaps a festival 's true test of success is measured by how good it tastes			2
as a result of a partnership between @entity133 's and the @entity4 , the ice cream company created @entity134 , a light coffee and malt ice cream , which made its national debut this year			1
while @entity4 certainly thrives on the extras it offers festival - goers , as well as its diverse musical acts , @entity26 says the festival 's charm and success really come down to community			1
" people are here , living on site , " he said			0
" they 're building a true community			0
people are totally immersed in it			0
there 's no tv , or hotel to go back to			0
... it creates a whole different environment and live experience that you ca n't replicate			0
" and it 's constantly evolving			0
" music is just the entry point for this platform for all arts -- for people to be creative , " he added			0
in the future , @entity4 , which @entity26 calls his " huge , never - ending art project , " will probably engage the audience even more and become a platform for people to get involved .			1

@entity4 will bring more than 80,000 people to @entity11 , @entity12
the festival becomes a unique destination with a comedy theater , cinema and more
