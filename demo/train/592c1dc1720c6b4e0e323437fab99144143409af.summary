the @entity1 is scrambling to track a growing number of @entity3 who have left to join the fight in @entity6 , including investigating how the young men were recruited and the logistics of their travel , officials said thursday			1
dozens of @entity3 are among the thousands of foreigners who have flocked to @entity6 to take part in its bloody civil war			1
" how are people being radicalized , what methods are being used , and what are the logistics behind the travel of some of these young men ? " said @entity15 , chief division counsel for @entity1 in @entity16 , discussing how @entity6 has replaced @entity17 as the go - to place for young jihadists in recent years			1
for three years , there was only one known @entity3 casualty in @entity6			1
but , in recent days , the toll may have tripled			1
on wednesday -- months after a @entity30 man killed himself in a northern @entity6 suicide bombing and a day after news broke that @entity32 , a 33 - year - old man reared in @entity33 , died fighting for @entity34 -- a coalition of @entity6 opposition groups announced that its forces had killed another @entity3 in battle			1
" although we have social media involved in radicalization efforts , we want to determine also if there is a ground game here with respect to radicalization our youth , " @entity15 told @entity39			0
authorities are trying to determine whether the other @entity3 killed in @entity6 last weekend is @entity50 , a @entity3 official told @entity39			1
@entity3 counterterrorism and intelligence officials were working to verify the name but have not confirmed it			1
the death of @entity32 was easier to verify because of photos of his neck tattoo , the official said			1
but @entity58 , a friend of @entity50 's family , told @entity39 from @entity16 that @entity50 was the second @entity3 killed in fighting over the weekend			1
the @entity6 coalition did not name the fallen @entity3			1
but it did say he and @entity32 died as its forces battled @entity64 , a historical reference to fanatical @entity66 who rejected moderate teachings and advocated killing those who violated ultraconservative values			0
the coalition noted that its fighters from groups with names such as @entity75 , the @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 had joined those from the more moderate @entity82 and more extremist @entity83			1
they took on @entity34 forces last weekend in and around @entity85 -- which is where @entity32 was killed			2
still , the idea of more @entity3 fighting for groups like @entity34 , and more of them dying , would n't be surprising			1
since about 2007 , the @entity1 has been tracking members of @entity33 's large @entity17 community who were recruited to fight for the @entity91 terror organization in @entity17			1
in recent years , some of those radicalized young men have been recruited to travel to @entity6			1
the story of one of them , @entity97 , who was a close friend of @entity32 's , predated @entity32 fighting -- and dying -- overseas			2
@entity97 converted to @entity66 and traveled to @entity17 in 2009 to fight for @entity91 militants			2
he was killed that same year after appearing in a @entity102 video encouraging young @entity3 to join the struggle			1
@entity97 's mother , @entity104 , told @entity39 thursday that the young man in the recruitment video for the hardline @entity76 group is in fact her late son			2
her son " was wanting to have a purpose and wanting to be a valuable human being and not finding that , " she said of the spiritual search of her son and his friends			0
" and then i think some of the things they were told were lies and some things were truths ... i think they felt that they could go help some people who needed help			0
" @entity97 attended the same @entity33 high school as @entity32			0
@entity104 said her son was a bright , passionate and energetic young man who enjoyed karate , basketball and dancing			0
" he really wanted to make a difference in the world , " she said of her son			0
@entity104 said her son struggled in school , had some legal troubles and a hard time finding a job			0
he turned to religion and left for @entity137 to study the @entity138 , she said			0
" i think they were manipulated , " she said			0
" i do n't think they knew fully what they were a part of			0
" she added , " the thing to focus on is , to not make young men ... feel powerless in our community			0
" some young men were lured to @entity6 , which is n't exactly a stable place with stable borders			2
nor is neighboring @entity151 , where @entity34 -- under the name it calls itself , the @entity154 -- has made major advances in recent weeks			2
" the ability to travel into these countries demonstrates how porous the borders are , " said @entity156			0
gen. @entity159 , who had top roles in the @entity161 in president @entity163 's administration			2
" i think we need to understand that there 's going to be more of this rather than less of this			2
" sources : @entity32 radicalized gradually the first @entity3 casualty was @entity170 , a 22 - year - old from @entity30 who joined @entity83 , an @entity171 - linked organization that the @entity3 government has blacklisted as a foreign terror organization			1
the group showed a video of him , and @entity3 officials later confirmed , taking part in a suicide bombing earlier this year in northern @entity6			1
@entity3 : jihadi in suicide bombing video grew up in @entity30 on tuesday , the world was introduced to @entity183			2
friends and relatives described him as a decent man who loved to play basketball and loved his family			0
his conversion to @entity66 did n't alarm his relatives , according to uncle @entity192 , though @entity194 posts in support of @entity34 did			0
he 'd been on @entity3 authorities ' radar for some time by then			2
they become aware of @entity32 in the early 2000s , due to his association with others -- including one person from @entity33 who died in @entity17 , apparently while fighting as a jihadi -- a @entity3 official said			1
still , there was no indication then that @entity32 -- who at one point studied @entity208 at @entity209 -- was involved in anything nefarious			0
law enforcement sources told @entity39 that he appears to have radicalized gradually in the years since his conversion			0
authorities did n't know about @entity32 's travels to @entity216 until he was already there , a @entity3 official said			1
@entity216 was also the last place where , several months ago , @entity32 was in contact with his relatives			0
at the time of his death , at least , @entity32 was on a list of @entity3 believed to have joined militant groups			1
such people would be stopped and subjected to additional scrutiny if they traveled , according to the official			0
@entity228 spokeswoman @entity227 added that @entity3 authorities knew about @entity32 's ties to @entity34			1
@entity227 did n't say how they approached his case , specifically , though she did lay out the government 's general strategy and concerns about cases like his			0
" we use every tool we have to disrupt and dissuade individuals from traveling abroad for violent jihad and to track and engage those who return ( to the @entity3 ) , " @entity227 told reporters wednesday			1
" ( @entity32 ) is a reminder of the growing concern that the @entity3 has , that many countries in the world have , about the thousands of foreign fighters from 50 nations who are engaged in @entity6 and who are affiliating themselves with ... extremist groups			1
" opinion : @entity34 : is it really a threat to the @entity3 ? official : @entity3 - turned - extremists ' willing ... to die ' @entity34 , especially , is n't just any extremist group			1
its tactics are so brutal that even @entity171 -- which was behind the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks -- disown them			0
defense secretary @entity260 last week called @entity34 " beyond just a terrorist group			0
they marry ideology , a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess			0
" this is beyond anything we have seen , and we must prepare for everything			0
" who is @entity34 ? that includes more @entity3 dying			2
some might be like @entity32 , who went to the @entity272 to join the jihad			0
or there may be more like @entity275 , the @entity3 journalist that @entity34 beheaded -- a gruesome execution that it videotaped and broadcast , along with the promise of more such killings if the @entity3 does n't continue to strike @entity34 in @entity151			2
@entity281 man arrested , wanted to join @entity34 man arrested after overseas trip , accused of sympathizing with @entity34			0
