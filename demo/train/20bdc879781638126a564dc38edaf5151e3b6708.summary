@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's foray into public art did n't spring from an epiphany or a burst of passion			1
it came from hundreds of unwanted white t - shirts stuffed inside cardboard boxes in his @entity0 apartment			1
seventeen years ago , @entity4 decided to make t - shirts with images of women in poses so provocative they 'd make @entity19 blush			1
but no one wanted to buy them			0
" it was very disappointing , of course , " @entity4 tells @entity2			1
one day , he scrambled into a park and dressed a nude sculpture with one of his unloved white tees			0
he snapped some pictures then removed the shirt			0
he showed the pictures to friends			0
" some people would say ' that 's very interesting , ' and some would get mad , " says @entity4			1
either way , the photos elicited strong reactions			0
obscene vandalism or public art ? whether he 's dressing nude , romantic era - styled statues in white tees , creating voluminous balloons shaped like human buttocks or setting up gigantic 3d zippers to protrude out of traditional @entity1 gardens , @entity4 's public art in @entity1 is whimsical , erotic and playful			1
there 's a sense that his work functions like a wink -- a reminder not to take everything so seriously			2
he takes something vaunted as high art , such as a classical nude statue , with romanticized human proportions and a stately countenance , and mixes it with a white t - shirt			2
" i want to make a work that takes two extreme elements -- the highest and lowest elements , " he says			2
some critics say his work is n't even art -- that it 's vandalism or a prank or even obscene			2
" whether the audience sees my work as pleasing or disturbing , the visual impact that jolts people awake is an essential part of my work , " @entity4 says			1
when still in his 20s , @entity4 quit his job at an architectural firm to become an artist			1
since his father was a landscape painter , @entity4 says he felt becoming an artist would be a practical profession			1
he became an assistant to a sculptor , learning techniques and working with metals and clay			0
these days , he asks for permission @entity4 is a slender man with a slight goatee , his hair underneath a pink and green newsboy hat			2
he moves quickly , light - footed , almost like a cat -- a trait that served him well back when he had to sneak a ladder into a park to put a t - shirt on a sculpture			0
these days , he seeks permission before dressing sculptures in public places			1
usually he gets denied , or receives no response at all			0
he says he 's still surprised when officials approve his requests			0
in the spirit of pop - up art , he removes the shirt from the sculptures after about 7 - 10 days			1
" i just want to let people walking by know something is going on , " @entity4 says			2
" i want to change something from the ordinary			0
" @entity4 also does more traditional work , decorating @entity1 festivals , cultural events and the occasional shopping mall			1
in several temporary installations , @entity4 has toyed with zippers			1
one giant zipper stretches through a quiet @entity1 garden at the @entity115 in @entity0			2
another ran through a house in @entity0 , exposing its flooring and structure beneath			0
( the house has since been demolished			0
) one of his zipper works currently on display at the @entity123 was commissioned by the @entity124 to clean up graffiti			0
" the zippers convey that what we are actually seeing in this real world is just a surface , and that once we peel it off , we see there 's another hidden space , which is completely different from our side , " he says .			0

@entity4 has created pop - up installations throughout @entity1
the artist got his start dressing sculptures with racy t - shirts
@entity4 uses balloons , t - shirts , zippers , ordinary items in his work
