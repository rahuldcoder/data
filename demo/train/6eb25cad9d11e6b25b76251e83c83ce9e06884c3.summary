a sixth person also is named in the indictment			0
in denying bail for @entity2 , @entity23 magistrate judge @entity28 said he " reluctantly " agreed with prosecutors that @entity2 is a flight risk and a danger to the community			1
@entity2 wore a white prison jumpsuit to court thursday , and was intently whispering and looking over documents with his federal public defender , @entity36			0
@entity36 vehemently argued @entity2 is a man of simple means and a married father of two young children			2
he poses no threat to flee , she argued			0
she also strongly implied @entity2 was paying for the alleged sins of his father			2
" they should not hold someone responsible for the things his father said , " @entity36 told the court			0
she said her client sent money wires totaling less than $ 3,500 to @entity7 , implying this was hardly the means to support terrorism			2
but federal prosecutor @entity52 argued @entity2 and his alleged co-conspirators provided money that the @entity7 @entity6 could have used to buy explosives and weapons for various attacks			1
" it 's the money given to groups like the @entity7 @entity6 that allow them to conduct their operations , " @entity52 said			1
" this is a group that is active now , " @entity52 added , even citing a @entity1 article about the @entity7 @entity6 carrying out a revenge attack for the death of @entity64			1
@entity52 also argued a network of family members in @entity3 and @entity7 could help him flee the country			0
@entity2 was arrested at an @entity12 hotel , and his lawyer said he was on a six - week business trip and was transitioning from being a limo and cab driver to the information technology business			2

his son , @entity78 , is an imam at the @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity3			0
the indictment does not charge the mosques with any wrongdoing , prosecutors said			0

the charges relate to alleged crimes committed between 2008 and 2010			0
the indictment describes a number of occasions when @entity76 transferred money to @entity7			2
@entity76 " solicited and distributed funds for the @entity7 @entity6 , both personally and on behalf of others , and worked with the co-defendants and others to support the @entity7 @entity6 's jihad , " the indictment says			1
the court documents recount several conversations between @entity76 and the other defendants in which @entity76 allegedly called for attacks against the @entity7 government and asked whether money had been delivered to the @entity7 @entity6			1
@entity76 is accused of building a madrassa in @entity7 's @entity126 that provided shelter for members of the group , the indictment states			1
the term " madrassa " traditionally refers to any @entity133 school , but in recent years news stories about madrassas radicalizing @entity137 students cast the word in a negative light			0
@entity76 operated and controlled a madrassa to shelter members of the @entity7 @entity6 and " to train children to become military fighters for the mujahedeen , " @entity23 attorney @entity140 said last weekend			1
he said authorities are aware of several unindicted co-conspirators in the @entity23 and @entity7			2
the @entity7 @entity6 represents a confederation of @entity6 groups in northwestern @entity7 , where they are based , according to @entity150 , a military affairs analyst who is managing editor of @entity152			1
those fighters attack targets in @entity7 and neighboring @entity155			0
the @entity7 @entity6 , which is headquartered in @entity156 , is separate from the @entity155 @entity6 , which has been focused on re-establishing the @entity137 emirate in @entity155			1
but both groups swear allegiance to @entity6 leader @entity160 and have close ties to @entity105 , @entity150 said .			0
