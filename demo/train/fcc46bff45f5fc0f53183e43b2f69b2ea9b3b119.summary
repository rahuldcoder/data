@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a gleaming classroom at @entity5 in the northern @entity7 city of @entity0 , students peer at onion slices under microscopes			1
their biology teacher calls on @entity11 to explain what he sees			2
" @entity14 , " he replies in perfect @entity13			0
@entity11 is @entity15 , a mostly @entity16 minority from @entity1 's far - west @entity17 , and he is thousands of miles from home			1
how he ended up in this mostly @entity21 school is the largely untold story of a grand @entity24 experiment			2
for more than a decade , the @entity7 government has selected tens of thousands of top minority students from @entity17 and placed them in high schools in eastern @entity1 -- the heartland of the @entity21 , the country 's biggest ethnic group			1
they call it the " @entity33			0
" " @entity1 is more developed than @entity17 and we get to enjoy better educational resources here , " says @entity11 , closely watched by government minders			1
@entity11 's journey to @entity5 took a well - traveled route			1
he was born in the ancient city of @entity41 in southern @entity17			2
@entity11 showed academic promise and was shipped to @entity17 's capital @entity44 for middle school			1
after passing a strict entrance exam @entity11 joined the @entity17 class			1
first time away from home but he had to look up @entity0 on the @entity49 to find out where he was going			2
it was his first time out of @entity17			1
" at first i was n't used to the weather , the schedule and eating habits , but the teachers helped us adapt , " he says			0
@entity15 ' religion , culture and turkic language separate them from the millions of @entity21 who have been encouraged by the state to migrate to @entity17 , helping to exacerbate ethnic tensions in this restive region			1
in 2009 , that tension boiled over with deadly ethnic riots between @entity21 and @entity15 that spilled out onto the streets of @entity44			1
and in recent months , @entity1 has been rocked by a series of attacks that the government in @entity70 blames on @entity15 separatists			1
for a party touting a " harmonious society , " this is deeply embarrassing			0
the dean of @entity77 's minority students claims that their program has nothing to do with those " thugs			0
" " we are just building future talent , " says @entity81			0
political purpose ? but from its inception , the @entity17 class had an overtly political purpose			2
@entity89 documents repeatedly call on the program to educate minority students to " defend the unity of @entity1 " and " safeguard national security			2
" " we are not just educating them , we are cultivating their love for the country , " @entity81 admits			0
the same could be said for any classroom in @entity7 , but for the @entity17 class , the political indoctrination appears to take on a special urgency			2
" the political goal is to try and create a patriotic ethnic minority cadre pool that will hopefully go back to @entity17 and serve the party state , " says professor @entity102 , a political scientist at @entity104 's @entity103			1
he says the party could be failing			0
" on the ideological front it has n't succeeded			0
what we 've seen is actually students who participate and graduate at these programs tend to feel more uyghur than they do @entity7 when they come out			0
" long - term studies , like those conducted by @entity119 , a specialist in @entity15 studies at the @entity122 - based @entity121 seem to back that up			2
@entity119 followed graduates from the @entity17 class for years and found that they did n't internalize @entity24 ideals			0
in particular , they appeared to become more religious , not less , despite or perhaps because of the ban on prayer in the program			0
at @entity77 , minority students live together in dorm rooms , they eat in separate @entity135 cafeterias and often end up forming their own soccer teams			0
the school insists there is no division amongst the students			0
for @entity11 , the @entity33 is the only opportunity to get a strong education and he says he wants to go to college and then back to his home to develop the region			1
" this is a really good policy provided by @entity147 , i am honored to be a part of it , " he says			0
@entity150 : @entity17 and tensions in @entity1 's far west @entity2 's @entity153 contributed to this report .			1

@entity11 is @entity15 , just one of many from @entity1 's ethnic minorities studying far from home
many have been placed by the government in eastern @entity1 , the heartland of the *majority* @entity21
at the same time , many @entity21 have been encouraged to moved to @entity17 , where @entity15 are from
this has created tensions that have frequently *erupted* into violent clashes
