@entity0 -- on a typical day , @entity3 's border with @entity4 is quite porous and vibrant			1
often from the same ethnic groups , traders from both sides share much in common and do brisk business			0
i saw that up close during a reporting trip for @entity1 a few years ago			0
at one border town in @entity3 's @entity13 , i saw residents from both sides , speaking similar dialects , buying and selling produce , consumer goods , minerals and timber , before crossing back to their own country			1
we even brought back @entity4 bank notes as a souvenir from the trip			0
scenes like this along the two countries ' 2,000 - kilometer border serve as constant reminders of long and deep bilateral ties			0
@entity4 , also known as @entity4 , was one of the first countries to recognize @entity3 's @entity36 government in 1949			1
over the years , after the 1962 coup @entity39 © tat in @entity4 , most @entity38 governments shunned the @entity43 nation because of its poor human rights record			0
@entity3 and the ruling junta grew closer , however , with @entity0 becoming the country 's most influential supporter on the world stage			1
" the @entity4 government really was thrown an economic , military and political lifeline by the @entity3 , particularly in the last 20 years in light of @entity38 sanctions , " says @entity49 , @entity50 director of the @entity51 , an independent think tank			1
" there is a very strong continuing political and economic relationship			0
" by the end of 2010 , @entity3 had become @entity4 's second - largest trading partner			1
@entity3 is also the biggest foreign investor there , with @entity3 companies building highways , pipelines and other major projects			0
for its part , @entity4 offers @entity3 energy resources and a strategic gateway to the @entity69			1
@entity3 access in and through @entity4 will lessen @entity3 's dependence on the @entity72 , a long and congested sea lane through which an estimated 80 % of @entity3 imported energy supplies pass			1
" close to the shipping lanes of the @entity69 and @entity43 , @entity4 is important for @entity3 to develop its southwestern provinces , which have a population of 200 million people , " writes @entity75 , a professor with @entity76 in @entity0 , in his column in the state - run @entity79 newspaper			1
just days before @entity88 secretary of state @entity87 's historic visit to @entity4 , amid signs of what @entity90 considers positive changes in the country under a new government , @entity3 's vice president @entity85 told @entity4 's top general in @entity0 the two countries should strengthen military ties			1
but not all has gone smoothly in @entity3 - @entity4 relations			2
in september , @entity4 unexpectedly suspended the construction of the $ 3.6 billion @entity101 hydropower station financed by a @entity3 company , citing environmental and social concerns			2
the project was meant to provide much - needed power to @entity3 but it would have displaced thousands of local residents			0
" the @entity4 people are very upset about particularly resource - extraction activities , where the @entity3 are not consulting the communities , they are not providing benefits to the communities , they displace populations and they engage in environmental degradation , " says @entity49 , the @entity51 analyst			2
the decision was seen as a rare concession by the government to public pressure -- and a blow to @entity3			0
" this incident made some believe that @entity4 is showing goodwill to the @entity124 at the expense of @entity3 interest , " an editorial on the @entity79 this week reads			2
other observers say @entity4 's decision on the dam project was largely driven by internal factors			2
" it 's a strong indication that the government is ready to say ' no ' to @entity0 when it is in its interest to do so , " says @entity131 of the @entity133 - based @entity132			2
@entity138 's visit is " an opportunity for the @entity88 to help move @entity4 away from authoritarian rule and into the world community , " she adds			0
" the visit also sends a strong signal to @entity3 that the @entity88 is seeking to contain @entity0 's influence in @entity4			1
" some @entity3 political observers are picking up that signal too			0
@entity138 's visit " will further unnerve @entity3 , which has recently been increasingly worried that the aim of the @entity88 ' new @entity50 policy is to isolate and encircle @entity3 , " writes @entity75 , the @entity76 professor			0
publicly , at least , @entity0 's diplomats maintain @entity3 is not worried about @entity4 's engagement with the @entity88 " @entity3 welcomes @entity4 and @entity38 countries to improve their relations on the basis of mutual respect , " says @entity152 spokesman @entity151			1
" we hope @entity4 's move will be conducive to the country 's stability and development			1
" @entity0 also appears more proactive in engaging the @entity4 people , especially after the controversial decision on the dam			0
it recently sent a rare @entity166 relic to @entity4 , a predominantly @entity166 country , to be on public display			0
" it 's part of this new outreach -- using religion , using media , using non-governmental organizations , " observes @entity49 of the @entity51			0
" @entity3 is trying to learn about how it can exert soft power			0
" even as @entity4 's leadership begins to mend fences with @entity90 , few expect to see @entity3 and @entity4 drift too far apart , thanks to the two neighbors ' inter-dependent relationship			1
" @entity4 continually depends on @entity3 's investment , on @entity3 trade and @entity3 political cover in the international community , " says @entity49			1
" @entity3 depends on @entity4 for access to its resources and also for the border to remain peaceful			2
