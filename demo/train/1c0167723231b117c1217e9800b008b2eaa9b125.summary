-- we all have weird , irrational concerns			2
so , if you 're just staring at your walls , drowning in fear that the great @entity7 may never release a digital typewriter app for your @entity9 , then this one is for you			1
i 'm just not exactly sure why			2
but , the new @entity14 writer app definitely looks , acts , and sounds just like a real typewriter , all nestled within the technological convenience of your amazing , space - age digital tablet			1
the one you bought to replace your laptop			2
which you bought to replace your desktop			2
which we all bought to replace our typewriters when we realized we were living in the ' 80s and did n't have to deal with this crap anymore			1
speaking of which , did you know the decline of typewriters can directly be traced to the rise of the @entity35 pop music duo , @entity36			1
it 's just that i sort of got sucked into an internet information wormhole , and that was my major takeaway			2
anyway , i really do n't mean to be critical of anyone 's interest in outdated typewriters			1
or even modern , pretend digital typewriters			1
after all , both are great if you enjoy that warm , old - world feel of seemingly irreversible mistakes			1
" @entity52 , you misspelled seven words			2
it 's not like it 's the @entity55			2
" " no , it 's your resume			2
" as for me , it 's just too much trouble			0
i 'm simply not hipster enough to fully appreciate a device that somehow makes it more difficult to write 700 words about not wearing pants			0
that kind of art requires only the very best modern technology			1
but long - form writing really is n't the point of the @entity14 writer , for it serves a completely different purpose			0
and it 's a hit			0
as i 'm writing this on thursday night , the @entity14 writer sits proudly as the no. 1 free @entity9 app in the @entity76			1
behold ! the awesome power of @entity7 ! he managed to take something from your parents ' garage , and put it right on your @entity9			1
but what i really find funny is the @entity85 category : productivity			0
i do appreciate the inventiveness of your app and your passion for the medium , however let 's not kid ourselves			1
it 's anything but productive			0
unless , of course , your goal for the day is to make multiple spelling and punctuation mistakes			0
in which case , it " s f&9 # ing greatgdzfg !			0
; to be fair , it does have a few necessary conveniences , like a setting which allows you to use " modern delete			1
" it also provides for copy - paste			0
so , it 's sort of a combination of old and new			0
users can enjoy the feeling of a typewriter while still processing words digitally			1
the idea is that what you make will feel to you , and look to your reader , like something more personal than an e-mail or a text message			1
and @entity7 argues that kind of personalization shines best through a typewriter			1
the @entity127 - winning actor is actually a huge aficionado of typewriters			1
a year ago , he even wrote an op - ed in the @entity130 about why he loves them so much			0
amazingly , @entity7 says he uses a manual typewriter almost every day			1
he wrote : " everything you type on a typewriter sounds grand , the words forming in mini-explosions of @entity138			2
a thank - you note resonates with the same heft as a literary masterpiece			0
" @entity142 , thanks for being my beautiful maid of honor on such a special day for me and @entity146			0
i 'm sorry you threw up in the hotel lobby			0
now , for what it 's worth , this column was crafted ( ha ! ) over the span of two days using two different computers			0
during that time , i paused to read more of @entity7 ' op - ed. and , despite my earlier cynicism , i admit that i now better understand the appeal			1
why do you have to be so charming ? so , yeah , i 'm sort of sold on the idea that an old typewriter might tap into your creativity in a different way			2
which is why they put a lot of thought into making this app. pulling from @entity7 ' vast personal collection , the app 's developer , @entity171 , created several totally original vintage - style typewriter choices			1
one of these comes standard with the app. the others are available for purchase			0
and each types with a completely different style			0
with the help of @entity7 , they literally studied the ink patterns of these old typewriters , and digitally recreated the typefaces within the app. thus , if you 're not working on anything too serious as a final draft , and if you want to explore your creativity and communication in a different , perhaps even more personal , way , the @entity14 writer might just be the app for you			1
" @entity142 , we just got a bill from the hotel			0
