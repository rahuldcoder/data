-- the @entity1 has rekindled excitement in the potential of the internet to nurture mass political movements by using the @entity6 to raise money and mobilize manpower			1
activists have used many aspects of cyberspace : facebook pages , @entity12 feeds , @entity15 apps and more to rally their supporters			1
according to @entity20 , " democrats and their allies dominated cyberspace for years			1
now the political right , with the @entity1 explosion , at the very least is matching the left			1
" the stories about the @entity1 movement resemble the narrative about @entity28 's campaign			1
in 2008 , @entity17 used cyberspace to the same effect			1
relying on what i called " @entity34 politics , " the @entity17 took @entity35 by surprise by demonstrating how powerful a vehicle the internet could be in promoting a candidacy , bringing like - minded citizens together and offering an organizational infrastructure for movement politics			1
yet will this form of organizing work over the long term ? can it sustain a movement after the drama of an election is over ? the verdict is still out			1
since 2008 , president @entity28 and @entity17 have discovered that the kind of movement created by the internet can be extraordinarily fragile and fleeting			1
when @entity28 recently spoke to students at the @entity55 , he implored them not to be apathetic and urged them to return to the world of campaigns			1
in doing so , he was acknowledging that the movement created by the campaign had disintegrated since the inauguration			2
the movement has been largely absent from the policy battles that have shaped his administration , and it lags in the months leading into 2010			2
@entity28 's team may still have all the cell numbers that they collected before announcing their vice presidential pick , but few people are answering or texting			1
what makes @entity34 politics vulnerable is that it lacks the local element that has always been so crucial to politics			1
the most durable forms of political organization have usually depended on local organizing			2
during the 19th century , political parties were dependent on a dense bottom - up structure rooted in the strength of local political machines			2
after @entity81 , party operatives continued to remain in close contact with voters			0
they worked hard -- sometimes through illegal means but very often through policy and straightforward patronage -- to retain their loyalty and make sure voters were kept abreast of why their party mattered			0
the social movements of 20th - century @entity90 depended on local organization as well			2
@entity92 recently recounted in @entity93 that the civil rights movement of the 1960s depended on local activists such as the four @entity98 students who sat in an all - white @entity100 's lunch counter in @entity101 , @entity102 , and demanded service			1
their personal ties and friendship , as well as their shared experiences , inspired them to work together and risk their lives for this bigger cause			0
the movement spread as students throughout the state and in other regions joined the cause			2
over the next few years , activists from the @entity102 would travel into @entity117 states and join the civil rights cause			0
it was the experience of directly participating in the struggles and witnessing the kind of racism that existed that forged their connection to the movement			2
conservatism in the 1970s was forged through similar dynamics			0
@entity128 did not make modern conservatism			0
rather , thousands of local activists around the country who interacted through church groups , civic organizations and even reading clubs gave rise to the modern right			2
it was their face - to - face encounters in places such as @entity142 , @entity143 , and the shared memory of influencing political leaders and public policy that made these @entity90 so loyal and willing to continue participating in these struggles over time			0
the cost of participating is much less			0
national conversations are as powerful , if not more powerful , than local networks			0
the experience of being in such a movement is often virtual , requiring nothing but a few clicks on a keyboard			0
some of the potential weaknesses of @entity34 politics can be seen with the new darling of the @entity1 movement , @entity162 candidate @entity161			1
although @entity161 has been omnipresent in the national media , she has been notably absent where it matters most , @entity167			0
@entity168 recently wrote in the @entity169 that @entity161 reflects the modern political strategy in that her campaign barely exists at the state level			0
conservatives from all over the country helped boost her image and reputation online and through television and radio , but she has barely had any public events in the state			0
@entity35 leaders in @entity182 did n't know where she was campaigning			0
despite her surprise win , she is way behind the @entity185 in the polls			0
without question , @entity34 politics has reshaped the political landscape			1
local candidates can rake in millions of dollars within days , and they can spread their name without anyone going door - to - door or holding fundraisers in the local @entity195			0
but @entity28 has already learned that this kind of organization can leave successful candidates without their base of support once the excitement of @entity81 is over			1
it is far too easy for the most fervent supporter of a candidate or cause to simply defriend the movement and move on to something else			0
rather than strong , shared memories of participating in something bigger than themselves , the experience might just leave behind the address of a web page in the auto - fill mechanism of their browser or an occasional text alert to remind them of their political past			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			1

@entity223 : @entity1 adept at " @entity34 politics , " rallying supporters via cyberspace
@entity28 , @entity17 had same success , but since election , web support is down , he writes
he says @entity12 , @entity34 ca n't sustain a movement when election drama is over
@entity34 politics lacks local element and commitment crucial to politics , @entity223 says
