the videotaped , apparent beheading of a fourth westerner by @entity2 holds strong similarities to the prior three			2
in all four videos , the victims are kneeling in orange clothing on the sand and a black - clad man with a @entity11 accent speaks to @entity13 leaders			1
but the taped killing of @entity11 aid worker @entity15 differs in some ways , most notably in being much shorter , at one minute and 11 seconds			1
@entity15 speaks very briefly , for 10 seconds , and appears less composed than at least two of the others			1
the camera has only one angle throughout , whereas there were multiple angles in the videotaped killings of @entity25 journalists @entity23 and @entity26			0
@entity23 's video ran five minutes and @entity26 's two minutes and 47 seconds			0
the latest tape , released friday , opens with a short news clip on the @entity11 @entity30 approving military strikes against @entity2 from the @entity33 news agency @entity32			1
then the recording goes to a slate that reads " another message to @entity25 and its allies			0
" @entity15 speaks , apparently forced to read a script as the other three victims had			1
@entity11 hostage of @entity2 was helping displaced @entity42 , aid group says a masked man dressed in black standing over @entity15 makes a reference to the third westerner beheaded by @entity2 , @entity11 aid worker @entity47			1
the killer says his message is for @entity11 prime minister @entity50			0
" the blood of @entity47 was on your hands , @entity50			0
@entity15 will also be slaughtered , but his blood is on the hands of the @entity11 @entity30 , " the knife - wielding killer says			1
in all four videos , the man wears black garb covering everything almost but his eyes			2
he wears a leather strap with a pistol and waves a knife in his left hand			0
he speaks with a @entity11 accent			1
" it sounds , and he looks very much , like the same executioner that we 've seen in the two previous killings , " @entity70 's @entity69 said in an interview when @entity2 released the video of the third beheading			1
" that accent there is unmistakably @entity11			0
" however , since the mask covers the man 's mouth , it can not be confirmed he 's the one speaking			0
it 's also not certain the man actually kills the hostages because the video goes to black before the beheading occurs			2
last week , fbi director @entity88 said the @entity25 believes it has identified the @entity2 militant in the video showing @entity23 's killing			2
@entity88 did not publicly identify the man but @entity94 officials said they believe the same militant speaks in the videos showing @entity23 , @entity26 and @entity47			0
who is @entity2 ? statement from family of @entity47			0

the four @entity2 videos have several similar elements
in all , a black clad man with a @entity11 accent addresses @entity13 leaders
the @entity15 video has a few differences
it 's not as long as the other videos and @entity15 speaks less
