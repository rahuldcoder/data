several days after the video appeared online , @entity8 surrendered to authorities and was charged for his involvement in the wrong - way crash			1

wednesday morning , @entity8 's confession video was played in the courtroom			1
@entity12 said he felt it would be beneficial for the video to be viewed because it was about " more than mr. @entity8			1
" he said it was about society and the " epidemic " of drugs and alcohol problems he sees in his courtroom			0
after the video was shown , the judge read two letters aloud			2
the first was from the victim 's ex-wife , @entity48			0
in her letter , @entity48 said her former husband would not want to see two lives lost as a result of this incident			0

" rising to speak on behalf of her father was the victim 's daughter , @entity92			0

" @entity8 said he was " going to do everything i can to walk out of prison a better man than i walked in			1
" he said he struggled with drinking , and had been a drunken driver before the night of the fatal crash			0
" i think the bad statistic is that first - time @entity147 offenders drink and drive 80 times before they get caught , and that is definitely a category i fall under , " he said			0
" i ca n't believe i did n't see something like this coming			0
that was one of the biggest emotions that i had throughout this , was frustration with myself			0
" asked about @entity92 's feelings about him and his video , @entity8 said he understands , and he does n't want to cause her pain			1
but his message -- pleading with people not to drink and drive -- is " one that is very necessary , " he said			0
" the whole point of it is so people do n't have to feel the pain that she 's feeling , and i hope to prevent that , " he said			0
