-- what is it with juries in high - profile cases in @entity5 ? over the years , they 've become a national joke			1
but no one is laughing			2
instead , with each travesty of justice and every acquittal that should have been a conviction , you 're left wondering just what trial these 12 folks were watching and questioning whether we should have higher standards for who sits on a jury			1
sometimes , the juries in local and state courts get it wrong , and the @entity22 must step in and make it right			1
think back to the acquittal in april 1992 of four @entity26 police officers who , one year earlier , savagely beat motorist @entity28			2
they walked out of a courtroom in @entity31 , @entity5 , as free men -- sparking days of rioting , looting and violence			1
at the time , the conventional thinking on newspaper editorial pages and on talk radio was the jurors in that largely white suburb of @entity26 , which was itself home to many active - duty and retired police officers , saw the police force as their line of defense against undesirables like @entity28			1
so naturally , the argument went , they would cut them some slack			0
the officers were tried again , and convicted in federal court of violating @entity28 's civil rights			0
there has n't been much civil unrest over what happened to @entity58 , the homeless and mentally ill man who -- on july 5 , 2011 -- was beaten to death by a swarm of police officers in @entity62 , @entity5			1
but now that the verdict is in , literally , on the two former officers who were charged in his death , there is plenty of outrage on talk radio , online and in other public forums			1
another 12 people who swore an oath to consider the evidence and the law and make sure that justice is served appear to have gotten it terribly wrong			1
this week , that jury in @entity79 , @entity5 -- a city about 30 miles southeast of @entity26 -- produced a wave of gasps in the courtroom when it announced that it had found @entity83 , who had been charged with second - degree murder and involuntary manslaughter , and @entity86 , who was charged with involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force , not guilty on all counts			1
what ? the beating was caught on a surveillance tape			2
when you watch those 33 minutes of footage , assuming you can stomach the experience , it 's hard to believe that anyone could declare the perpetrators " not guilty			0
" the surveillance camera footage shows @entity58 being beaten and stunned with a taser by police until he was unrecognizable and unconscious			0
you see a defenseless and compliant young man screaming in pain , saying he 's sorry and pleading for help from his father			0
his words will haunt you , " daddy , help ! they 're killing me ! " according to prosecutors , the young man suffered brain injuries , facial fractures , broken ribs and extensive bruises and abrasions			0
he wound up lying in a pool of blood			0
he died five days later			0
this was not a by - the - book case of police officers using all necessary force to subdue a suspect who was resisting arrest -- a suspect , by the way , who had committed no crime			1
this was not , as @entity83 ' attorney claimed , a case of police offices simply " doing their job " with " no malice in their heart			2
early on in the confrontation , @entity83 appears to tell the young man who is sitting on the ground : " you see my fists ? they 're getting ready to f --- you up ! " another officer is heard telling a comrade : " we ran out of options so i got to the end of my taser and i ... smashed his face to hell			0
" there is the malice			0
this was abuse of power and an instance of bullying behind a badge			1
it happens more than we 'd like to think in @entity164			1
but this time , it went too far			0
and a man died , and a family was shattered			0
yet , the jury somehow missed all this ? how does this happen ? in @entity26 , people are saying that the mentally ill are the new @entity28			2
in the same way that the jury in @entity31 was inclined to back the officers who it saw as protecting them from people like @entity28 , now the jury in @entity79 is backing the officers who it counts on to prod people like @entity58 to move along , leave the streets , and get out of sight			2
it 's a plausible explanation			0
human beings are n't perfect , and sometimes those who sit on juries are plagued by their own prejudices -- in this case , against those who behave in erratic ways which we do n't understand			2
this much we can understand : cops are supposed to protect the weak , not prey on them			0
just like they 're supposed to protect all of us			0
the tragedy of @entity58 raises a question : when police officers lose control and go from public servants to violent bullies , who will protect us from them ? in this case , there is only one answer and one place left that can right this wrong : the @entity22			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			1

@entity209 : too many high - profile cases in @entity5 produce travesties of justice
he says jury acquitted two *ex-cops* in *malicious* beating death captured on video
he says case showed abuse of power , bullying behind badge ; happens too often in @entity164
@entity209 : only one place left that can right this wrong : the @entity22 .
