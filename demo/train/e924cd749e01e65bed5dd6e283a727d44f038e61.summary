" @entity18 " cleaned up at @entity10 's @entity55 awards , scooping seven trophies including @entity57 , @entity58 , best actor , which went to @entity20 , and @entity60 , for @entity21			1

as @entity64 's leading lady , @entity33 blossoms , but when @entity64 urges his fellow players to move from inspiration to action , she finds herself at the center of a plot to ensnare and murder @entity22 collaborator mr @entity77 ( @entity20 )			2
dressed in cheongsams and primped and curled to perfection , @entity33 sets out on the biggest role of her life			0
as mrs @entity24 , she gains @entity9 's trust through his wife , and the plot progresses as planned until an unexpectedly fatal twist spurs her to flee			1
cut to @entity23 three years later : @entity33 is caught in a listless existence when @entity64 unexpectedly re-enters her life			0
he lures her back into the unfinished sting operation , and before long she and mr @entity9 , now head of the collaborationist secret service , are engaged in a torrid affair that pushes her soul and her loyalty to the limit			0
newcomer @entity21 gives a startlingly assured and subtle performance			1
at times , she seems to mirror @entity33 's transformation into mrs @entity24 from dowdy student to rouged mistress , but she rises to the challenge and ably carries the film on her slender shoulders			0

every diamond demands the right setting to sparkle , and @entity20 's generous performance as the enigmatic mr @entity9 lets his co-star shine			1
@entity116 is pitch - perfect , and shows his quality as he lets @entity9 's beautifully impassive mask shift and slip , revealing a tightly - wound coil of repressed emotion beneath			1
@entity116 is remarkable : a highly skilled actor capable of expressing a world of emotion in the smallest muscle movement			0
the audience is left to imagine the horrors he unleashes during his interrogations of @entity25 resistance fighters			0
the already - infamous sex scenes can appear a little clumsy and contorted at times , less intimate than acrobatic ; it 's when @entity20 and @entity21 sit in silence that they most project how intimate and electric their connection really is			1
the lead characters are ably supported by a stirling cast , most notably a splendidly nuanced performance from @entity138 as mrs @entity139 , forced to turn a blind eye to her husband 's affairs , both in business and of the heart , while @entity146 pop superstar @entity65 gives a convincing and impassioned performance as romantic , ruthless @entity64			2
as for the ambience , @entity9 is known for his attention to detail , and at times the 30s luxe and glamour is perhaps a little too perfect , a little too glossy , with a depth of style usually reserved for more placid period pieces			0
( note for fashionistas : while " @entity162 " might inspire a 2008 trend for bias - cut 30s dresses , " @entity18 " will add perfectly formed cloche hats and cocktail rings to the mix. ) but this chilling , thrilling film - noir - inspired tale is both poised and elegant , bloody and erotic ; if not quite a diamond the size of a quail 's egg , " @entity18 " is certainly a precious pearl of a movie			1

@entity9 's latest film , " @entity18 " is a film - noir spy tale set in @entity23

too perfect in parts , with @entity186 sex scenes , the film is still a killer thriller
