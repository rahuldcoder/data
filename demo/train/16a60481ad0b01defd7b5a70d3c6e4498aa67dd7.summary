-- @entity1 and @entity3 's journey to obesity is a familiar road for many married couples			2
neither was overweight when they met on a coffee break at work			2
nor were they obese when they cut their wedding cake , iced with an image of @entity13 's @entity12			1
but over time , working and raising foster children in @entity16 , @entity17 , the pounds added up			1
" i put on about five to 10 pounds per year for 20 years , " @entity18 says			1
at age 55 , she says she was " one blood test away from being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes , " when she started having chest pains			2
remembering that her father died of a heart attack when he was only 55 , she went to the hospital			2
there , a doctor told her she too had had a heart attack -- one that , without medical attention , would have left her with only hours to live			2
" that was the big trigger , " she says			2
at 5 feet , 4 inches tall , she was closing in on 300 pounds			1
she knew she had to lose weight , but also knew from experience that dieting was n't the answer			2
her husband , whose body mass index had increased from 23 to 34 since graduating college , agreed			2
so instead of cutting their portion sizes down to starvation rations , the @entity39 decided to rely on their training as chemical engineers			1
they began tinkering with recipes to see if they could reduce the calorie counts of their favorite foods			1
" we put our food on a diet , " says @entity18			0
" @entity52 is the solution to pollution			0
that ( theory ) does n't work for environmental engineering in the long run , but does work for food			0
" the @entity60 ' strategy is a powerful one , says @entity62 , director of nutrition for @entity64 , a site @entity18 used to calculate calorie totals for her new recipes			1
@entity62 , also a registered dietician , uses the @entity39 ' approach in counseling and has seen patients experiment with it in their homes			1
" deprivation does not work in the long run , " she says			0
" and @entity1 and @entity3 are a great example of how to turn this into a lifestyle change			0
" it took four or five months of experimenting to re-engineer some of their favorite recipes and start losing weight , according to @entity3			1
the key to the new recipes , says his wife , was minimizing the amount of carbohydrates and maximizing the amount of vegetables			1
" a lot of what we did was kind of tricking the mind and stomach , " she says			0
" for every food we took out , i tried to put one new one in			0
" they reinvented many of their favorite dishes , such as mashed potatoes , substituting cauliflower for the potatoes			1
they traded the white rice in chicken stir - fry for high - fiber pita wraps			1
they even replaced the pasta in baked spaghetti with a self - invented broccoli slaw			1
over the next year and a half , @entity18 lost more than 130 pounds			1
" we 're still trying to do cookies and treats that are low - calorie , " he says			1
" she has a meringue cookie that 's 4 or 5 calories			0
we believe food companies should engineer their foods to be low - calorie , like we 've done			1
" by using a scientific approach , the couple turned weight loss into a project they could work on together			1
before they started experimenting with recipes , @entity3 did most of the cooking from boxed foods			1
now they collaborate on recipes ; she does most of the cooking and he handles the cleanup			2
" it was part intellectual and part doing it , " he says			0
" it was really good for our marriage			0
" in addition to counting calories , @entity18 exercised more			0
she started out wearing a pedometer			0
over time , her steps increased from 3,500 per day to about 17,000			0
" ( the amount i now walk ) almost makes me like an @entity150 person , " she jokes			0
exercise significantly increased @entity18 's energy level , says @entity153 , 19 , who calls the @entity39 her grandparents			1
she describes her grandmother as a health nut , and says she enjoys going shopping with her now because the older woman does n't have to stop every few minutes to catch her breath			0
" we can share clothes now , " she says			0
" @entity18 is retired ; her husband will join her in about six years			0
he 's glad he chose to drop the weight slowly because it is more indicative of a successful lifestyle change than a diet			0
he knows retirement will expose him to more chances to eat poorly and excessively			0
" i 'm trying to develop how i 'm going to keep ( the weight ) off , " he says			0
