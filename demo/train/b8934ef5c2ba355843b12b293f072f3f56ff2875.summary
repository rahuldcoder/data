-- the summer vacation season is already in full swing across the @entity3 , and for many families that means loading up the car and heading to the beach			2
but as temperatures rise , so do the instances of air , road and railway congestion			0
with @entity3 on the move , the resulting traffic jams show the poor state of our infrastructure			1
lane closures , potholes , flight and rail delays all have one thing in common : a lack of adequate investment in our transportation systems			1
the beleaguered @entity27 , which provides money for @entity3 roads , bridges and highways , is expected to go broke soon			1
the @entity32 has just said it would support legislation for a short - term fix to keep the fund going through the height of the summer construction season			1
the federal dollars from the highway fund help supplement states ' transportation projects across the nation to help keep travel routes safe , efficient and well maintained			2
this fund is vital in ensuring that @entity3 roads and rails do not go from inconvenient to impassable			1
the fund relies primarily on revenue from the 18.4 - cent - per - gallon gas tax and 24.4 - cent - per - gallon diesel fuel tax			1
but because of a variety of factors -- from cars becoming more fuel - efficient , to states purchasing less gasoline from year to year , to the state of the gas tax ( which has not been raised in 20 years ) -- the trust fund is running on empty			1
5 ways the highway crisis could affect you if you think our roads , bridges and rails are in deplorable condition now , just think what would happen if the trickle of federal funding ever were to run dry			1
if @entity71 does not replenish the @entity27 quickly , ongoing projects will grind to a halt and new projects will be pushed back indefinitely			1
states depend on the money from the trust fund at levels ranging from 15 % to 60 % of their transportation projects			2
an empty @entity27 would affect the entire country , but certain states and projects could be hit especially hard			0
@entity84 , for example , has long depended upon federal dollars for miles of roads and bridges as well as many transit projects			1
without the trust fund 's capital , more than $ 2 billion worth of construction projects would be at risk			2
these projects range from road repairs to comprehensive transit rehabilitation projects and are of vital importance to the safety of @entity84 's transportation network			0
on the other side of the country , @entity99 could be in dire straits , too			0
our smallest state depends on around $ 200 million a year to keep its transportation hub a viable connector in the @entity108 and @entity109 states			0
without this continued federal investment , delays in @entity111 could worsen , clogging the entire @entity114 corridor			2
this is not just a coastal problem , either			0
in @entity119 , a whopping 47 % of highway and transit projects depend upon support from the @entity27			0
the @entity121 has already been preparing to shut down many ongoing projects , with a spokesman saying : " we 're going to be in virtually a maintenance - only mode , and even that is short of what we need to maintain our system			2
" state and city governments rely on the investment from the @entity27 in order to make important projects a reality			0
however , without action from lawmakers in @entity138 , many projects could be delayed indefinitely and construction workers will be sidelined			0
this is not only bad for travelers -- it 's bad for the economy			0
in fact , more than 700,000 construction jobs are at risk if the @entity27 goes broke			0
as the @entity3 begins to see economic improvements following the @entity150 , a job market shock of this magnitude would be a huge step backward			0
yet @entity71 seems poised to allow this to happen , a move that would directly affect millions of @entity3 -- especially those already frustrated with the delays they experience during this increasingly high - volume travel season			1
americans must make @entity71 listen			2
one way is the " i 'm @entity168 " app , created by @entity161 as a simple , fast and secure way for people to share travel frustrations with their representative or senator			0
if you find yourself stuck on a highway , the tarmac or a train station , this app allows you to take a quick photo and send a message to your lawmaker			0
it 's a modern - day letter - writing campaign -- one that will be hard for @entity71 to ignore			1
@entity3 infrastructure is already in dire need of funding , and we can not let @entity71 make the problem worse by letting the @entity27 run dry			1
the trust fund must be replenished as soon as possible -- but a long - term , comprehensive plan for infrastructure investment must become part of our country 's legislative agenda			1
@entity71 needs to either raise the gas tax and index it to inflation or pass comprehensive tax reform that could include provisions to pay for long - term infrastructure investment			1
lawmakers need to find a way -- where appropriate -- to bring in the private sector to assist and take advantage of the groundbreaking work being done at our great universities to use technology to improve our vital systems			0
while we are stymied on repairing our infrastructure , other countries are moving ahead with modern ports , highways and broadband			0
in order for the @entity3 to stay competitive on an international level in the 21st century , we must invest in 21st - century infrastructure			2
the next time you are frustrated with a travel delay or stopped in traffic , pull out your cell phone and tell @entity71 to do its job			1
it just might be the wake - up call our government needs .			0
