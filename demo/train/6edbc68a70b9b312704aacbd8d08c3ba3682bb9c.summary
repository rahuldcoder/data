-- you know a little something about how to order healthy at @entity4 restaurants			0
brown rice trumps white , summer rolls are lower cal than egg rolls , and you should run from @entity11 's anything			1
but with the explosion of @entity4 fusion , figuring out what to order can be as murky as a bowl of freshly stirred miso soup			0
" there are hidden fats and preparation details that can really keep you guessing , " says @entity17 , @entity18 , a spokesperson for the @entity19			0
and those unknowns can double , even triple , the calorie count and fat content of a dish			1
here 's how to dig in without blowing your diet			0
edamame is n't automatically low cal before you make an appetizer out of those delicious fiber - packed soybeans , ask how the pods have been prepared			1
if the answer is that they were simply steamed in water , they 're an excellent pick , but " some places toss them in oil after steaming them , " @entity37 reveals			2
" so what starts out at 120 calories per half cup becomes 220			1
" that may not seem like a lot , but if you 're on a diet , a bowlful could do you in			2
solution : request they serve ' em with no added oil			2
@entity0 : everything you need to know about soy 2			0
lobster sauce does n't deserve its bad rap it tastes so rich it has to be naughty , right ? actually , at just about 50 calories per quarter - cup , it 's one of the lower - cal sauces			1
" it 's not laden with sugar like sweet and sour sauce , either , " notes @entity69 , a chef and author of @entity71			2
those light - as - air shrimp chips are n't so light they seem way healthier than old - school crunchy noodles			2
but do n't be fooled : they 're a mix of deep - fried shrimp and starch , and they 'll set you back more than 200 calories and 14 grams of fat per handful , says @entity85 , @entity18			1
she suggests sipping a cup of green tea while you wait for your @entity89 © e. otherwise , you could munch away a meal 's worth of calories and fat before it shows up			1
@entity0 : dine out like a health pro 4			0
veggies are n't always virtuous what could be healthier than ordering a side of green beans ? plenty , if they 're from a @entity101 menu			1
before stir - frying veggie side dishes , " @entity101 restaurants traditionally deep - fry them for extra texture , " says @entity102 , co-executive chef at @entity103 in @entity104			1
what 's more , some veggies absorb oil the way sponges drink in water , explains @entity85			1
" eggplant soaks up oil and sauce like no other vegetable , " she says			1
opt for less sponge - like veggies such as broccoli , snow peas , or peppers			1
plus , ask them to stir - fry only and go light on the oil			1
the same goes for steamed dumplings sure , steaming saves calories , but whether it 's enough to matter depends on what 's inside			2
a steamed pork dumpling is around 80 calories -- just ten fewer than the pan-fried version			2
those stuffed with vegetables , on the other hand , are about 35 calories a piece			2
so if you love the pork version and can stop at one dumpling , go for it			0
but if you 're , well , only human and tend to enjoy a few at a sitting , try the steamed veggie dumplings -- three will save you more than 130 calories and nearly 10 grams of fat over their steamed pork brethren			2
bonus : " veggies naturally have a lot less sodium than shrimp or pork , " notes @entity155 , @entity18 , author of " nutrition at your fingertips "			1
@entity0 : irresistible , healthy @entity4 recipes 6			0
stir - fry wo n't derail your diet sure , it 'll cost you more in the calorie department -- a main - dish veggie stir - fry is about 370 calories per serving versus around 140 for its steamed counterpart -- but the pay - off in flavor may be worth it			1
" steamed vegetables are the best option , but stir - fried is ok too , as long as a minimal amount of oil is used , " says @entity171 , chef and owner of @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175 , and host of " @entity177 " on @entity178			1
plus , you 'll get the added health benefits of ginger , an anti-inflammatory , and garlic , which is loaded with antioxidants			0
as for that " minimal amount , " just ask them to use as little oil as possible			2
the lightest lo mein is n't always veggie it 's often shrimp ! a serving at @entity196 's clocks in with about 30 % less sodium and nearly 200 fewer calories than the veggie version			0
wondering how vegetables could be the less healthy choice ? see number 4 , above : @entity4 restaurants tend to drown them in sodium - loaded soy sauce and oil to enhance flavor , @entity203 says			1

tofu takeout can be a diet wrecker not all soy is skinny - making			0
" some tofu dishes are high in calories because the tofu has been deep - fried before it hits the stir - fry pan , " @entity37 reveals			1
be sure to ask how it 's prepared , and steer clear if it 's fried or described as " crispy " -- or ask them to use soft or plain tofu instead			0
you can have your ( sushi ) crunch and eat it too who needs tempura ? there are waistline - friendlier ways to get the texture you 're craving			0
" request a sprinkling of chopped peanuts , almonds , or cashews on the inside or outside of your roll , " suggests @entity231 , the corporate culinary manager at @entity233 restaurant group			0
" or ask for some crispy salmon skin in the roll , " she adds			0
" you 'll get omega - 3s and really great flavor along with the crunch			0
one entrÃ © e serves two people @entity101 and @entity250 dishes typically contain enough food for two or three people			1
" it 's meant to be family style , " says @entity252 , a food and beverage consultant and author of " @entity254 "			0
so if you 're dining out , split with your guy or a friend			0
eating in ? portion out half before you dig in -- then save the rest for tomorrow 's ( yummy ! ) lunch			0

at about 50 calories per quarter - cup , lobster sauce is one of the lower calorie sauces
some veggies absorb a lot of oil , so opt for ones like broccoli , snow peas and peppers
@entity101 and @entity250 dishes typically contain enough food for two or three people
