-- @entity1 had a crush on @entity3			1
he 'd take long looks at her during class			0
when she left school , @entity8 would ditch just to watch her walk down the hall , push the doors open and glide away			1
he thought about telling her all the time			0
but he was too scared			0
he liked her so much			0
high school is intense everywhere in this world			0
one day , @entity8 saw his chance			1
he approached @entity3 's brother			1
please give this to your sister , he said , and handed the boy his number			0
" i was tortured , " he said			0
" the girl i liked most was n't calling me			2
i did n't have her number			2
i wanted to tell her , ' @entity3 , i love you			1
' " days went by , and his mobile rang			0
hearing her voice stunned him silent for a minute			0
" @entity1 , are you ok ? " she asked			0
and they talked , as kids do , sweet and nervous			0
pretty soon , they were in love			0
eventually , @entity8 got the courage to tell @entity3 that he just could n't be without her			1
will you marry me ? he asked			2
but she knew it would never be that simple			0
@entity3 and @entity8 are from different castes , he from a lower one than she			1
@entity3 knew that her parents would be furious and that they were working on finding someone for her to marry			1
but she told them anyway , still holding onto hope that they might understand			0
' honor ' crime : why just kissing a boy can trigger murder " you will spoil your name ! " her parents shouted			2
her father threatened to kill them both , and he hit @entity3			1
" i was disturbed ... listening to ( these ) words , " she said			0
" the day my father came to know , that night he hit me and tortured me			0
" the 22 - year - olds sat side by side today and recalled what they believed was their only option			0
" we decided we will die , because we do n't have any other way , " @entity3 said			1
then , one afternoon , they caught a popular television talk show featuring an unlikely band of former lawyers and activists who 've made it their mission to help doomed lovers			1
@entity18 's @entity78 , formed in 2010 , give couples food , shelter and protection if they run away from their disapproving families			1
the group has more than 11,000 volunteers across the country who provide legal assistance , man 24 - hour help lines and , in some cases , even marry desperate couples			1
" we have far too many problems in @entity18 to worry about someone choosing to love another , " said founder @entity91 , who married his wife because he chose to			0
" how can society object to love relationships ? " he asked			0
" our young boys and girls have rights			2
@entity18 has become the country of killers of love			0
" every couple that approaches us is under so much pressure , so much stigma , where they feel they may be killed any minute			0
" so - called honor killings have surged in @entity18 over the past few years , with victims defying traditional @entity112 customs			1
many of the deaths have been those choosing to marry outside their caste			1
at least five couples were killed in 2010			2
but that figure does n't begin to show what human rights experts say are likely hundreds of reprisals			2
there are no official figures on honor killings , because they often go unreported or family members pass them off as suicides or natural deaths , according to @entity129			1
@entity18 's supreme court has issued notices to the national government and several states to protect couples , yet in @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 provinces alone , an estimated 900 honor killings occur annually , according to a 2012 report by the @entity141 , citing reports from nongovernmental organizations			1
the @entity78 stand a chance of accomplishing what officials have failed to do , said @entity147 , the @entity148 director of @entity129			1
" there is n't a social worker network available to these young people who feel really isolated , so this group could be doing a wonderful thing , " she said			1
the spike in honor killings is partly a result of @entity18 's changing cultural norms and a generation fighting to keep things the same			1
" there 's more television , more kids are going to college and blurring the social lines , so that people have a chance now to find a partner for themselves , " @entity147 said			0
@entity8 and @entity3 started their relationship and fostered it through calls on mobile phones			1
they imagine they 'd never have even met if it were n't for them both attending the same school , because they lived in villages that were miles apart			2
she and @entity8 called @entity78 , who are sheltering them in an undisclosed location			1
when @entity0 visited @entity3 's family to try to get their side of the story , her grandfather shouted that there was no point			1
@entity3 is " as good as dead " to them , he said			2
she knows she ca n't go home			2
@entity8 says that her family has filed complaints against his with local authorities and that his family and a friend who helped them have been jailed			1
but the two married , with @entity78 ' help			2
the group helped them craft a letter to their families , letting them know			2
they are thinking about the future			0
@entity8 said he 's going to make sure that @entity3 continues going to school			1
they are happy , they said , and have no regrets			0
" we are both fine , " @entity3 said			2
" if society thinks otherwise , let them			0
" why do honor murders still happen ? @entity0 's @entity208 and @entity209 contributed to this report .			0

volunteers help couples who , because of caste differences , are n't allowed to be together
expert : some who 've resisted arranged marriage have been victims of honor killings
young lovers @entity8 and @entity3 ran away , and the @entity78 helped marry them
