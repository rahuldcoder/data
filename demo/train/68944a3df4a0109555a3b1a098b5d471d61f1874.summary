august 2013 the same missile unit at @entity104 linked to the test cheating scandal failed a safety and security inspection " after making tactical - level errors -- not related to command and control of nuclear weapons , " the @entity102 said			1
the @entity111 operates about 150 of the 450 @entity114 nuclear - tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles in the @entity4 force , according to an @entity2 statement			1
a failed inspection does not mean that the safety of the nation 's nuclear arsenal is at risk , @entity102 commander lt. gen. @entity117 said in august			2

" commanders use these inspections to continually improve our training and procedures			0
