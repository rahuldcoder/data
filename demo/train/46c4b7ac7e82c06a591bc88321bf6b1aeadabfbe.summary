-- i give @entity2 a call because i have a hunch he will have something funny to say			1
the subject : @entity7 of @entity8 and the 50th anniversary ( this saturday ) of its winning 1963 's national championship of college basketball			1
the man on the phone : a proud @entity7 grad , maybe the school 's most well - known : a comedian , actor and star like few others in this great big tv land of ours			1
" you know , my first memory of @entity7 basketball actually goes back to 1949 , " says the 83 - year - old @entity2 , who is still second to none in knowing how to begin a monologue			1
" @entity7 's team came home from winning a big tournament game that we were n't supposed to win			1
' giant killers ! ' they were called			0
we were all naturally proud of our team			0
' " then it turned out that players from the team we beat ( @entity38 ) got caught shaving points			0
so i guess that giant we killed was n't quite as gigantic as we thought			2
not so much back then , but funny now			0
happily , a funnier thing happened on march 23 , 1963 , when the @entity7 shocked the two - time defending champion @entity46 and the whole college basketball world by winning the @entity49 tournament			1
@entity50 : last - minute bracket advice that team : won by the wacky score of 111 - 42 over @entity54 in the tournament 's opening game , to this day , the largest margin of victory in the @entity62 men 's tournament 's history			1
@entity63 defeated a @entity65 team that had to sneak out of the state of @entity68 just to play the game , certain parties down @entity71 objecting to their all - white boys occupying the same court as a @entity8 team with non-white young men on it			2
@entity63 bounced the @entity77 boys from @entity78 by 15 points			1
@entity63 decked the @entity81 team in the @entity82 by 19 points			0
and then , down by 15 points in the second half , came back to conquer @entity46 in overtime 60 - 58 on a last - second shot			0
" we win ! we win ! " roared the @entity7 ' radio voice , @entity91 , on the air			1
the @entity49 title game had also been on national tv for the first time , but @entity8 's @entity96 delayed it to air a live telecast of a high school championship game instead			1
" so throughout the city , " @entity8 historian and author @entity99 recalled recently for @entity101 , " many crafty radio listeners used their knowledge of @entity7 's amazing comeback to clean up on barroom bets			1
" i tell @entity2 this			1
" ah , now that 's the @entity7 i know ! " he says mirthfully			1
no joke , though , @entity2 : @entity7 ( 29 - 2 ) was king of college ball			1
not another university from the state of @entity78 has won the @entity49 men 's crown since			1
@entity116 took 10 of the next 12			0
the football - free @entity121 institution from the @entity123 of @entity8 went back into relative anonymity in big - time athletics , an onlooker as the likes of @entity119 and @entity81 and ( yes ) @entity38 became lords of the rings			0
@entity7 has n't even been in the @entity129 field since 1985			1
@entity130 in @entity131 i recently enjoyed phone conversations with three of @entity7 's surviving 1963 players -- @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 -- while doing a story for @entity140 's magazine			1
each is pleased by this burst of golden anniversary limelight , although it sure would be a nicer honor if the @entity146 basketball museum in @entity147 , @entity148 , would heed a proclamation made by lawmakers in @entity147 , @entity78 , that the @entity7 should be enshrined in the game 's @entity151			1
because guys of a certain age can tell you : this was one amazing team			0
" i remember pulling for them because @entity162 was a basketball power back then and this little school from @entity8 beat them , " said @entity158 , 71 , who later would coach @entity159 and @entity160			2
" i think everyone was stunned			0
" stunned by the way this school won , not just the fact that it did win			1
it used just five players			0
no other @entity172 set foot on a court in that @entity49 title game except @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity176 and the man whose last - instant putback of a @entity135 miss gave @entity7 the championship , @entity177			1
coach @entity181 did have a couple of other valuable guys for a while , but @entity185 ( who became a @entity186 after college ) and @entity188 flunked their midterms in early february and were ruled ineligible			0
" we played five guys a lot , and we had our tongues hanging out a lot , " @entity137 , 70 , a @entity8 attorney , told me			0
he did n't mean the way @entity198 's tongue would later hang out			1
this was sheer exhaustion , not a facial tic			0
the coach ran the @entity7 ragged , pressing opponents from one end of the gym to the other , no matter how many tongues hung			1
@entity7 scored 100 points or more in its first six games			2
topped the 100 mark 11 times in all			0
lit up @entity159 for 123			0
one of the season 's first foes was @entity212 , coached by @entity213 , who would later take the @entity214 to the 1981 @entity216 championship			2
an under - used member of @entity7 's team who is still with us , @entity217 , did an interview not long ago in which he remembered the way @entity176 guarded the visiting team 's top player so relentlessly , @entity176 even followed the kid during a timeout to the @entity212 bench			1
substitutions with a big lead ? sympathy for the losing side ? nah			0
" @entity232 had no mercy , " @entity231 recalled			0
the coach had a bleeding ulcer and a curt manner at times , which did n't endear him to his own guys			2
but he 's the one who got them there			2
his contacts in @entity242 landed him @entity136 , @entity176 and @entity185			0
he turned to @entity243 to recruit high school teammates @entity135 and @entity177			2
he added the feisty @entity245 local boy @entity137 to the stew			0
he started four black players when such a thing was n't being done			2
@entity65 's players did n't cotton to racial bias any more than the @entity8 school 's did			1
they and their coach defied @entity255 politicians by catching a plane to @entity159 for a regional game in @entity258			0
hands were shaken , black and white , and a splendidly played game ended 61 - 51 in @entity7 's favor			1
eight days and two victories later , @entity7 found itself in @entity263 , @entity38 , making history			2
championships were not in @entity7 's dna			1
it did get to that @entity268 title game at @entity269 in 1949			0
but the wins over @entity271 and @entity38 lost their luster when point - shaving accusations were confirmed against both losing teams			0
@entity50 : @entity275 with bracket - busting potential @entity2 , class of ' 52 , did n't go there for basketball			1
" no , but i think at that time they enforced a 5 - foot - 9 or over limit , " he fibs			0
when a chance came for his college to become as famous in sports as he had just become in show biz , @entity2 said he did n't pay attention because " i was still worrying they 'd find me out and make me go back to being an accountant			1
" he was for real and @entity7 was as well			2
oh , the @entity46 kids did go up by 45 - 30 , but the @entity7 would n't fold			1
@entity136 , a legit @entity290 player , and @entity135 , one of the most unfairly underrated college players of all time , led the way			0
in overtime , tied at 58 , @entity136 expected to shoot , but said , " i just did n't feel it			2
" he passed to @entity135 , who let it fly but missed			0
@entity177 rebounded it and laid it in at the horn			0
fifty years later , not everybody 's still around			2
the buzzer - beating hero , @entity177 , died in 1999			0
the cagey coach , @entity232 , went two years later			2
the rah - rah radio guy , @entity91 -- " he eyes it , he tries it , he buys it ! " -- was silenced eternally in 2009			0
several players do remain , basking in the glory of their school 's one shining moment			2
" it 's a great , great school , " said @entity2 sincerely , and not just because the @entity316 on campus now bears his name			1
" you know , my sister taught there , and she became a nun			0
and the new pope is a @entity121 , and i 'm a @entity121 - educated guy , so i 'll be praying that he knows what he 's doing			0
just like i 'll also pray that @entity7 does n't try to deny that i ever went to school there			1
" no chance of that , @entity2			2
just as no one can deny that @entity7 of @entity8 was once the star of the show			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity333 .			0

saturday marks 50 years since @entity335 won the 1963 @entity49 championship
surviving teammates would like to see the @entity7 in the @entity146
no @entity78 university has won the @entity49 men 's crown since
@entity7 alum @entity2 : i pray @entity7 does n't try to deny that i went to school there
