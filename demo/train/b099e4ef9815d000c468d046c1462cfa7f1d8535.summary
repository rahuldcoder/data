@entity0 -- space has come of age , grown up enough to be commercially viable -- or has it ? for more than 80 years the @entity5 has been looking at how we get into , and travel in , space , but the society has concentrated more on the technical achievement or feasibility than on the finance or contractual requirements			2
from the end of @entity14 , technologies were very much in the hands of the defense industries and development was funded by the defense departments of national governments			2
recognizing the strategic importance of space led to the ' space race ' and the conquest of space being nationally or government funded			2
the end of the @entity26 led to the end of the space race -- governments no longer had to prove their nation 's technical superiority in space			2
but in many western industrialized nations , as the government support and funding reduced overall , there appeared a raft of technically capable companies and some government departments and entrepreneurs who were able to identify key areas where there could be a viable and sustainable return on their investment			1
communications satellites became commercial products as soon it was realized that communications capacity could be sold and could provide a realistic return over their lifetime			1
@entity54 and @entity56 observation ( @entity53 ) missions have not met with such commercialization yet			1
it is difficult to see a commercial return from scientific exploration of either our own planet or other celestial bodies			1
but the gathered @entity53 information could see a commercial return from the sale of mapping , environmental or weather data , or charges for navigation services			1
however , military and government owned assets -- already fully operational -- make it hard to compete			0
when it comes to launchers and human spaceflight things are changing			0
the original missile - based launch vehicles gave way to commercially manufactured , but government - owned and operated systems			0
now the launcher market is opening up as new players broach new user markets			1
space tourism and small payloads have very different launch requirements that are best satisfied by new systems -- like @entity90 's @entity89 and @entity92 's @entity91			2
@entity5 spokesman @entity93 adds : " for many the fascination for space is the almost visceral desire we have to travel further and faster to explore and to spread human interest across the cosmos			2
the @entity5 has championed the goal of eventually colonizing the solar system and , indeed , traveling on to the stars one day			0
" to achieve this human spaceflight ambition , @entity103 is quite correct in its decision to use a commercialized approach to lowering the cost of launching astronauts into orbit			0
the investment in @entity112 's @entity111 and the @entity114 spacecraft for flights to the @entity116 from 2017 will make seat prices cheaper and more sustainable			0
" for the future though , reusable spaceplanes such as the @entity120 's @entity119 are the real answer to getting humans and hardware into space to properly explore and occupy the rest of the solar system			2
" to help this low - cost approach happen , purely private space tourism spacecraft companies will offer affordable flights to space , with @entity90 's @entity131 and the @entity132 going sub-orbit in the next two years			0
one day we will see space hotels in orbit and then on the @entity137 and eventually @entity138			0
" to go into deep space , to asteroids , the @entity137 and @entity138 , governments will have to foot the bill initially , but the possibilities are immense and there is a very exciting future for humans in space , " he said			0
@entity5 president - elect @entity148 believes the @entity120 government 's new policy of maximizing economic return from space is illustrated by the recent studies into setting up spaceports in the @entity120 , both for suborbital and orbital flights			1
" the recent change in @entity120 government direction , with the formation of the @entity158 as a key component , is at long last connecting the vision within @entity120 with the capability to realize its potential , " he said			0
another important factor of space exploration is in its relations with the dual areas of education and outreach			1
space education @entity5 vice president @entity170 said : " space -- and especially space exploration -- has been shown time and again to engage and motivate students in a way that few other topics can			1
" it also has a role to play for defining how a country sees itself			0
one only has to look at the recent exploits of @entity183 and @entity184 to see how success in space exploration can transform a nation 's view of itself and what its citizens can achieve if they believe they can aspire to greatness , " he said			1
@entity103 's decision to sub-contract @entity112 and @entity192 is a sign of things to come , but governments must continue to support and fund those areas that are not yet self - sustaining			0
the @entity120 space sector is currently bringing in over Â £ 11.3 billion ( $ 18.07 billion ) per annum to the @entity120 economy and supports 99,000 jobs			0
the @entity120 government , recognizing this important contribution , plans to capture 10 % of the world space market and generate more than Â £ 40 billion ( $ 64 billion ) per annum by 2030 , according to the @entity120 government			1
this will certainly require the support and leadership of @entity120 industry and the creation of up to 100,000 new jobs			0
with @entity184 's @entity212 spacecraft now orbiting @entity138 and @entity183 's " taikonauts " in @entity56 orbit and its @entity216 lunar lander already on the @entity137 , the competition is heating up			1
the space industries of the @entity219 industrialized nations must play their part in identifying where they can make a real contribution and even take a leadership role , while the national space agencies take on more of a coordination and funding role , particularly in scientific exploration and manned missions			1

it is difficult to see a commercial return from scientific exploration , says @entity234
@entity56 observation missions have not met with commercialization yet , says @entity234
but the launcher market is opening up as new players broach new markets , he says
@entity234 : national space agencies should take on more of a funding role for science missions
