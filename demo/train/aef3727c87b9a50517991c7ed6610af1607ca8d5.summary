here 's a look at laws already on the books in the @entity7 dealing with firearms			1
1791 -- second amendment : @entity10 ratifies the @entity9 to the @entity11 , which reads that " a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed			1
" 1934 -- @entity18 : the law was designed to make it difficult to obtain especially lethal guns			0
these would include preferred weapons of the era 's gangsters , like sawed - off long rifles or shotguns and machine guns			2
