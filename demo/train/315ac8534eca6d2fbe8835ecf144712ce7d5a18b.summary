-- when pro quarterback @entity2 pleaded guilty to bankrolling a dogfighting operation in 2007 , there was a spike in reports of dogfighting in the @entity7			1
one of six dogs recovered from a @entity9 , @entity10 , dogfight waits in a kennel last week			2
but when the headlines faded , the blood sport grew stronger and went even more underground , with thugs taking inventive precautions to keep police at bay , animal cruelty experts say			1
" they know it 's just not smart to have large crowds anymore , so we 've seen fights where you 've got the two handlers , a referee and web cams everywhere broadcasting the fight on the @entity34 , " said @entity20 , an investigator based in @entity21 who directs the @entity23			1
fights are also being staged on the move -- in 18 - wheelers			1
" these guys are very sophisticated , " @entity20 said			0
" if you 're driving down the road , there could be dogs in that truck driving next to you that are dying			0
" dozens more dogfighting cases have been investigated and prosecuted since the @entity2 case , said @entity46 , who runs the database @entity48			1
the computer programmer , horrified when a neighbor 's cat was set on fire eight years ago , created the @entity54 - based organization to track animal cruelty cases and animal abusers			1
the database , which logs media stories , has also become a popular place for law enforcement to send reports			0
" there 's not a central body keeping track of what 's happening nationally , which is unfortunate when you consider that a lot of these cases cross state lines , " she said			2
still , detectives , animal welfare professionals and prosecutors agree that the attention the @entity2 case has brought to dogfighting has been positive because more people are inclined to report their suspicions			1
dogfighting is illegal in all states ; penalties vary but usually include heavy jail time or steep fines			2
the @entity82 suspended @entity2 indefinitely in august 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation at a home he owned in @entity87			1
@entity2 , 29 , was freed from federal prison in @entity89 , @entity90 , on may 20 and returned to @entity87 to serve the last two months of his 23 - month sentence in home confinement			1
" at the height of attention on the @entity2 case , things quieted down across the country with some of these dogfighters getting out of the business , " veteran animal abuse investigator @entity93 said			1
" but then , the headlines went away , and people thought the attention was off			2
it just started right back up , almost stronger than before			0
" " every saturday night in every county in @entity106 , there is a dogfight going on , " @entity93 said			0
while the @entity2 case was making its way through the court system , @entity93 , who directs the animal cruelty task force at the @entity112 of @entity106 , was initiating what would become an 18 - month investigation linking dogfighting rings in eight states			1
that probe led to the july 8 arrest of 28 people from eight states			0
as many as 400 dogs were confiscated in raids coordinated by federal , state and local law enforcement agencies , @entity93 said			0
he said it was the largest such case involving dogfighting in the @entity7 while those involved with the national case declined monday to give details about that investigation , @entity0 spoke with several detectives across @entity7 who have worked other dogfighting cases			1
among the abuses they 've uncovered : dogs with missing ears and patches of skin animals with teeth shaved down to the bone " vets " who have used leg splints that are to tight to " treat " animals in dogfighting rings contraptions , usually fashioned out of wood , much like a treadmill , that force chained dogs to run or be choked			2
detective @entity149 of the police vice squad in @entity151 , @entity21 , described a case he recently investigated that resulted in the convictions of three men			1
a neighbor called police when she saw a mangled dog that had apparently escaped from a home where investigators found 60 chained pit bull terriers , many being starved and wallowing in their own waste			2
there were thousands of hypodermic needles scattered across the ground			0
" they were using steroids on the animals , " he said			0
" there was one dog -- in such bad shape , man -- tethered to a logging chain , and another was kept in a two - foot shed without ventilation or food			1
" the suffering is incalculable , and the cost of caring for the animals is steep			0
because the national investigation originated in @entity106 , the state is harboring about 400 of the rescued dogs , some that have had puppies recently			0
" these dogs are bred to attack each other , so just caring for them is a tremendous job			0
you have to keep them separate , and you have to protect volunteers who are devoting 12 , 14 hours of their day , " @entity93 said			0
" and we 're doing all of that in this economy			0
" investigating dogfighting is dangerous -- and hugely popular in @entity198 mafia circles and with drug traffickers in @entity200 , experts say			2
dogfighting is reliant on word of mouth , and on what one undercover officer described as " bad character " references			1
" if you can get someone to vouch for you , a match is set up , " @entity20 said			0
" they 'll have everyone go to a hotel and come pick you up and drive you around in an unmarked van			0
" driving around town helps shake any police tail , he said			2
those betting on fights are n't likely to get paid on site any more			2
money is often kept at another location , making it more difficult to make arrests			0
in late july , @entity82 commissioner @entity222 conditionally reinstated @entity2 , who said on " @entity223 " on sunday night that he cried in prison because of the guilt he felt about dogfighting			1
@entity2 's agent announced thursday that the former @entity228 signed a two - year deal with the @entity230 , which reportedly could be worth more than $ 6 million			1
" i hope people realize [ dogfighting ] is not just about @entity2 , " @entity93 said			1
" it 's a lot bigger than him			0

dogfighters are using web cams , staging fights in 18 - wheelers to avoid police
@entity2 case brought attention to dogfighting , but cases have not *decreased*
detective : anyone who wants to get into dogfighting needs " bad character " reference
