after more than a year adrift in the @entity1 , and after eight years away from his hometown , @entity0 is home			1
around 8:30 p.m. ( 9:30 p.m. et ) , after arriving on a flight from @entity5 , @entity0 was wheeled before a swarm of reporters in the airport terminal in @entity10 's capital of @entity11			1
looking tired and weak , he appeared unable to muster any words after being handed a microphone			1
@entity0 waved meekly -- eliciting applause from travelers and airport employees who 'd lined up to see him -- and sat quietly in his wheelchair as people shouted out and cameras flashed			1
then , he put his hand on his head as he was wheeled away			0
his next stop was to be a hospital , where @entity25 , @entity10 's vice minister of health , said @entity0 's health will be monitored			1
if and when everything checks out , presumably , @entity0 will be free to roam his native @entity10			1
but it 's understandable if , when that happens , it will seem like a strange place			2
his miraculous -- some say unbelievable -- story has captured the attention of so many			0
even where he was found -- in an atoll in the @entity37 that is as secluded a locale as they come , set deep in the @entity1 some 2,000 miles from @entity40 and 2,400 miles from @entity41 -- @entity0 's rescue and recovery attracted a crush of media			1
it got so intense he moved to an undisclosed location to avoid the hubbub , sources familiar with his care told @entity50 on saturday			0
@entity51 , a spokeswoman for @entity10 's foreign ministry , said @entity0 " felt harassed " over the last two weeks , after having spent so many weeks alone			1
now that he 's going home , she said tuesday that he 's looking forward to spending time with his parents and daughter , as well as eating pupusas , a traditional @entity58 dish			0
as to all the attention from everyone else , @entity51 said , " he does n't know what awaits him			1
" " he does n't know what it is like to be a celebrity , or how to respond to all the media attention			1
" his odyssey began in late 2012 when , he said , he left @entity67 on what was supposed to be a one - day fishing expedition			0
but @entity0 said he and a 23 - year - old companion were blown off course by northerly winds and then caught in a storm			1
eventually , the pair lost use of their engines and , according to @entity0 , had no radio signal to report their plight			2
four weeks into their drift , his companion died of starvation because he refused to eat raw birds and turtles , @entity0 said			2
eventually , he threw the body overboard			0
@entity87 recounts how he survived @entity0 's next interaction with humans came january 30			1
it was then that islanders on @entity92 , a remote atoll on the already remote @entity37 , spotted the mysterious visitor			0
as he inhaled pancake after pancake , @entity0 recounted what he 'd gone through			2
soon after , images of the bearded , bedraggled castaway began circulating worldwide			0
his claims about his time stranded at sea garnered widespread skepticism about how he could survive the more than 6,000 - mile trek across the open ocean			2
but officials in the @entity37 have said repeatedly that they have no reason to doubt the story			0
his story is resonating in his hometown , the coastal @entity58 village of @entity111			0
balloons and ribbons hang across the house where @entity0 's family lives there , and a " @entity118 " banner is strung up outside on a palm tree archway			1
a heart - shaped decoration made by his niece says , " may @entity123 bless you			0
" now clean - shaven and gaining strength , @entity0 is expected to end up back in @entity111 for his homecoming			2
as she awaited his return this week , his mother , @entity128 , said she 'd been praying for him since his last visit eight years ago			2
" that was the only hope i had all this time , " she said			0
" i would pray to @entity123 , and i wo n't lie to you , i was crying ; but i never lost my faith			0
