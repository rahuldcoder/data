-- @entity1 fired a six - under - par 66 in foggy conditions to lead the @entity3 at @entity4 and keep his @entity5 hopes alive			1
the 36 - year - old @entity6 is keen to take part in the team tournament , named after @entity10 legend @entity9 , when @entity11 and @entity12 take on @entity13 in september			1
@entity1 beat @entity14 in the amateur @entity15 16 years ago and his impressive round in @entity17 kept him on course for a return to team competition			1
" i 've been trying hard all year to make it and if it comes around it will be a massive thing for me , " he told the @entity22 's official web site			2
@entity1 fired eight birdies and two bogeys in foggy conditions to lead by a shot from @entity32 @entity31 and @entity33 , from @entity34			1
@entity1 came close to winning both the @entity36 and @entity35 in recent months and lost out on the @entity37 by dropping two shots in the final two holes			1
" i learned a lot from that , " he said			0
" i would say i lost that tournament through nerves really , just not controlling myself			0
" but i think it took that week for me to be able to play the way i 've been playing at the moment , where i have more belief in myself and know i can do it			0
i think i 'm a better person and a better player			0
" play began over two hours later than scheduled because of the fog , meaning not all of the field managed to finish their opening round			1
@entity31 did , though , and was pleased to be sitting just one off the lead			2
he said : " i think anything under par around here is a good score			0
today the course is playing long , with all of the rain , the ball was running nothing , so it was quite long			0
" i think the key was that i played very solid , just hit most of the fairways , most of the greens , and took my chances			0
i never really got in trouble and that 's probably what is the main thing to do here			2
" @entity13 's @entity73 captain @entity72 finished on one - under while @entity74 , who will take over the role in 2012 , ended on one - over .			2

@entity6 's @entity1 leads the @entity3 at @entity4
@entity1 fires an opening round of 66 in foggy conditions in @entity17
@entity32 @entity31 and @entity33 from @entity34 are a shot back
