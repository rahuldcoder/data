@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 became the first @entity1 mainland region to ban bullfighting after its parliament voted wednesday to outlaw the tradition on animal cruelty grounds			1
the vote was 68 in favor and 55 against , with nine abstentions			0
those who see the ancient tradition as animal cruelty were ecstatic about the vote , celebrating in the street outside parliament			1
fans of bullfighting said the decision , however , does not mean it will disappear from other regions in @entity1			1
some analysts have said @entity24 nationalism -- including the desire by some in the region for independence from @entity1 -- played a part in the vote			1
the upcoming regional elections for parliament later this year may have also had a role			0
bullfighting is an ancient tradition in @entity1 , and fans say it combines culture , ceremony and artistry			1
opponents , however , consider it animal cruelty			1
activist @entity42 , of the @entity43 , known as @entity44 , said she has attended just one bullfight in her life , and that was only to get a sense of the bull 's suffering			0
" bullfighting is part of @entity1 culture , " @entity42 said			1
" but that should change			0
many traditions disappear as the society advances			0
" @entity57 , 24 , lamented that he might be the last @entity0 - born bullfighter to take the " alternativa , " or ceremonial fight in the ring against the biggest bulls to become a full - fledged matador , which he did last year at @entity0 's sole remaining bullring , the @entity65			0
@entity57 's father worked at the bullring , opening the doors for bulls to charge in to face matadors and their death			0
" my father brought me to see the bullfights when i still had a pacifier , " @entity57 said			0
" it would be frustrating not to be able to give to my children what my parents gave to me			0
" the number of bullfights across @entity1 has dropped by a third in recent years , mostly because of the budget constraints of local governments , which often fund the spectacles			2
in @entity3 , there are now just more than a dozen fights a year and the @entity65 bullring in @entity0 is one of the few places in the region that still holds fights			1
a pro-bullfighting group called @entity92 released a study predicting big economic losses for @entity3 if bullfighting were banned , mainly because the @entity24 government would have to pay damages to the bullfighting industry , which holds long - term operating licenses			2
" when the @entity24 government and the opposition are working hard to trim the budget , how could they justify making big indemnity payments to the bullfighting industry , when it 's not necessary , " @entity92 president @entity100 said			0
critics have disagreed , saying the economic impact would be minimal given the small number of fights still held in @entity3			2
the proposal to ban bullfighting started as a popular initiative in @entity3 and was accepted for consideration by parliament last year by a slim margin of votes			1
since then , there has been an ever - intensifying debate , with bullfighting proponents and opponents gathering support from across @entity1 , even from abroad			2
the ban is due to take effect in january 2012			0
it will not end bullfighting in the rest of @entity1 , where it still has a strong following in @entity129 and in the south around @entity131			2
@entity1 's @entity132 in the @entity133 does not allow bullfighting , but the ban in @entity3 is considered a bigger blow to the tradition .			1
