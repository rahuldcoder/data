asked the simple question , " what would it take to get the @entity11 shows a release in @entity13 ? " before long , shout ! @entity15 producer @entity14 was asking fans how much interest they would have in such a release and what they would like to see on it			1
18 months later , the first of the " @entity11 shows , " known as " transformers : headmasters , " was officially released tuesday for the first time in the @entity13			1
such is the relationship that geek - friendly companies like @entity3 ! have with fans that this release has seen the light of day			1
" i 'm really excited about it , " said @entity31 of @entity32 , @entity33 , moderator of seibertron.com , a " transformers " community site that boasts as many as 300,000 page views per day ( mostly by fans whose interest in " @entity39 " goes well beyond one of the biggest box office successes of the year , " @entity44 , " and its predecessors )			1
" this is the first time we 've gotten a legitimate release of this @entity50 series			1
you would have to get recordings of them burned onto dvds , or import them from @entity56 or @entity57 , or find a laser - disc player from the 1980s to watch this			0
" @entity31 and others from seibertron.com -- one of many fan sites like @entity62 , tformers.com and @entity63 -- said that these releases were one of the most sought - after items by fans over the years			2
the transformers first became a pop cultural phenomenon in the @entity13 in the mid- ' 80s , based on a pair of toy lines from @entity50 's @entity11 company , @entity73 and @entity74			1
when interest in the characters faded after a very short - lived fourth season of the original " @entity80 " animated series , it came full circle with the @entity50 producing " headmasters , " the first in a series of anime which took the characters in a wild new direction , involving new characters who were able to detach their heads , which were entirely separate characters ( the @entity13 series only touched on this concept briefly before it ended )			1
" it really is interesting to see just how the @entity50 and their culture played into a series that for most of us we 've only known as straightforward @entity101 vs @entity102 , " said @entity14 , a " transformers " fan himself who has produced all of the @entity3 ! factory releases of other series , such as " @entity80 " and the 1990s " transformers : @entity105			1
" " [ the @entity11 anime series ] really bends towards a lot of things that @entity50 children want to see , " said @entity31			1
" after ' @entity111 ' is over , the transformers are not so much sentient robots but having human drivers			2
from what i understand , @entity50 children prefer having human drivers			1
" @entity14 pointed out other , more subtle culture differences			0
" where the @entity80 characters would call @entity121 ' optimus ' -- they were pretty casual with their leader -- the @entity50 approach it very differently			1
@entity121 will be referred in more of a formal manner , he 'll be ' commander ' or something among those lines			0
" " the @entity101 and @entity102 [ in these series ] are , no pun intended a well ordered machine , " he said			0
" it 's interesting to watch those characters change culturally			2
" " some major characters die early on , " said @entity132 of @entity133 , @entity134 , a podcaster at seibertron.com			0
" later in the series , another major character bites the dust			0
they do n't mess around			0
" as with any anime import , there is the eternal debate of " subbed versus dubbed			1
" there are some fans who simply do not want to watch subtitles			2
@entity148 , head programmer for @entity149 ( which is owned by @entity150 , also owner of @entity0 ) , and one of the top people responsible for what anime series are seen in the @entity13 , said that every effort is made to get dubbed versions			1
" i think they 're more likely to reach a more mainstream audience , and we 're always hoping to get a larger audience excited about anime , " she said			2
" i think hearing it in your native language allows you to get more absorbed in the action , and to pay more attention to the animation , which is often just gorgeous			0
" in the case of " headmasters " however , the episodes are not dubbed , but have brand - new subtitles			1
" we saw the releases that had come out in the @entity175 and @entity56 and saw that the subtitles there were n't entirely accurate , and in some cases did n't make sense , " said @entity14			0
" it was clear that the folks who had translated did not use @entity181 as their first language			0
we gave it to a really good captioning and subtitling house in @entity186 and they did a brilliant job of accurately translating the dialogue and understanding what was being said			0
we got those scripts approved by @entity192 ( owners of ' transformers ' ) , and we 're really happy with the outcome			2
the translation is about as close as one can get to an accurate translation of what 's being said in @entity50			1
" dubbed versions of the series are out there , however , including one for @entity203 and @entity204 television			2
" when we heard them , it really got to a point where it was comical , " @entity14 explaned			0
" the voices were awful			0
@entity211 disappears and is simply replaced by ' @entity211			0
' it was almost the equivalent of watching a saturday afternoon martial arts movie dub , and that 's certainly not something we wanted to do with a property as beloved as ' transformers , ' so we opted out of original dubs and went for brand new subtitles			1
" early fan reaction to this was not entirely positive			0
" there was a small bit of disappointment that the project could n't secure enough funding to do a brand - new @entity181 dub , " said seibertron.com podcaster @entity224 of @entity225 , @entity226			0
" i kind of share that feeling , but i also know that this is n't going to be a very mainstream release , and for them to spend that much money would be kind of a gamble			2
i appreciate that they 're staying cautious			0
" " people who have not seen it before might be disappointed in the subtitles , but rest assured [ that the existing dubs ] are that horrible , " said seibertron.com founder @entity240 , from @entity241 , @entity242			0
" you ca n't actually sit there and watch the dubs , unless you like drinking while watching ' transformers			0
' " @entity31 said that the @entity11 series ' legacy extends beyond a mere curiosity : " the themes are non-western compared to what @entity192 does now but some of the design aesthetics do play into what we see today			0
" the other @entity11 series will be released in the near future as " the @entity50 collection , " though a production delay has postponed its release for several weeks			1
despite those delays and some early hesitation from the subtitle - phobic , @entity240 said that most fans are just excited to check the shows out : " this is something that i never thought i would see released in the @entity13			1
" indeed , this is just the latest example of fans communicating directly with companies to make a difference in what material is released to the public			1
@entity148 has communicated often with a " vibrant " community of fans on the @entity149 message boards			0
" we definitely look at what people are talking about online , what people are watching and buying online , too			0
from that , we 're always looking for shows that we think will appeal to our audience , and then we pass it around the office -- several of us are anime fans , as well , so we make our own focus group			2
" as for the importance of the release of " headmasters " specifically , @entity14 said , " it gives [ fans ] something definitive , something approved by @entity192			1
casual fans who just love @entity250 will be really surprised by the quality of the show			1
these were things that were almost , for lack of a better word , lost to @entity13 audiences			2

@entity50 's " transformers : headmasters " released in @entity13 for the first time
it 's the latest example of fans *influencing* what material is seen by the public
@entity50 took @entity13 " @entity250 " *cartoon* in wild new directions
the release *reignited* the anime " subbed *vs.* dubbed " debate in some circles
