the chairman of the @entity1 accused the @entity2 of secretly removing classified documents from her staff 's computers in the middle of an oversight investigation , while another lawmaker said @entity10 should " declare war " on the spy agency if it 's true			1
sen. @entity12 said cia director @entity13 told her in january that agency personnel searched the computers last year because they believed the panel 's investigators might have gained access to materials on an internal review they were not authorized to see			1
" the @entity2 did not ask the committee or its staff if the committee had access to the internal review or how we obtained it , " @entity12 said in blistering remarks on the @entity1 floor			1
" instead , the @entity2 just went and searched the committee 's computer			1
" @entity12 said that she had " grave concerns " the search may have violated federal law regarding domestic spying as well as congressional oversight responsibilities under the @entity35			1
opinion : @entity12 is no bomb thrower " i have asked for an apology and a recognition that this @entity2 search of computers used by its oversight committee was inappropriate			2
i have received neither , " she said			0
@entity43 sen. @entity43 of @entity44 called the allegations " dangerous to a democracy , " if it 's substantiated that the @entity2 interfered with a congressional investigation			2
" heads should roll , people should go to jail , if it 's true			0
... i 'm going to get briefed on it			0
if it is , the legislative branch should declare war on the @entity2 , if it 's true , " @entity43 said			2
@entity12 's comments pushed into the public spotlight months of behind - the - scenes wrangling over access to and the review of documents around the post 9/11 @entity63 administration program for handling terror suspects			2
@entity13 disputed @entity12 's claims relating to the committee 's efforts to produce a comprehensive report on the practice that ultimately was ended by president @entity71 in 2009			0
" as far as the allegations of @entity2 hacking into @entity1 computers -- nothing could be further from the truth			1
we would n't do that			0
i mean that 's , that 's , that 's just beyond the scope of reason , " @entity13 told the @entity78			0
he also said that the @entity2 believes in congressional oversight and often has " spirited " conversations about agency techniques			2
" we have made mistakes			1
and we have tried mightily to learn from them , " @entity13 said			0
@entity13 said in a statement last week that he was " deeply dismayed " that some members of the @entity1 have made " spurious allegations about @entity2 actions that are wholly unsupported by the facts			1
" @entity96 spokesman @entity95 said president @entity71 has " great confidence " in @entity13 and the intelligence community			0
@entity95 would not comment on the specifics under review by the @entity101 but said @entity71 supported the committee 's investigation			2
" the president has made clear he seeks the declassification , the findings of that report when it is completed , " he said			0
@entity101 asked to look into @entity2 / @entity1 dispute the top @entity43 on the intelligence panel , @entity110 of @entity111 , said " we have some disagreements " on the facts and cautioned that improving the relationship with the @entity2 " is not going to happen if we throw rocks at each other			1

the @entity101 is looking at whether to launch an investigation involving the committee 's review of millions of documents at a @entity132 facility and counterclaims by the @entity2 about @entity1 staffers gaining access to things they should n't have seen			1
@entity12 took issue with the @entity2 @entity139 's referral of the case to the @entity101 as an attempt to intimidate the committee			1
she said committee staff " did not hack into @entity2 computers to obtain these documents , as has been suggested in the press			0
" she said the documents were identified through a search tool provided by the @entity2 in order to select specific material , and that the pane would follow through with its report as planned			0

the committee launched its full blown investigation after learning in an initial review that the @entity2 had " withheld and destroyed information about its detention and interrogation program			1
" this , according to @entity12 , included its decision in 2005 to " destroy interrogation videotapes over the objections of the @entity167 and the director of national intelligence			0
