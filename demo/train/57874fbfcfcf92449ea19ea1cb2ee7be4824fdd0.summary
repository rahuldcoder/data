@entity0 , @entity1 -- five @entity4 contractors detained inside @entity0 's @entity5 now face the @entity1 judicial system , which critics say is rife with problems			1
the case of five @entity4 detained in @entity1 is likely to be handled by the @entity10			1
the five were taken into custody early wednesday in connection with the killing of another @entity4 contractor , @entity16 , according to an @entity1 official involved in the investigation and another source with knowledge of the case			1
as of monday , none of the five had been charged			2
however , under the @entity1 system of justice , they would not be charged until after an investigative judge examines the evidence and decides whether to refer the case to court for trial			1
the men appeared before an investigative judge sunday and monday and will appear again tuesday , @entity1 government spokesman @entity31 told @entity2			1
they were told to expect a decision tuesday on whether they would be freed or stand trial , a source close to the suspects told @entity2			0
under @entity1 law , an investigative judge is assigned to a case when a person is detained			1
the judge questions the accused , takes statements , and examines and assesses evidence to build a case			2
the judge also can ask for additional investigators			0
the law says that detainees must meet with the judge within 24 hours of being detained			2
however , the current strain on the criminal justice system -- a large number of detainees and a shortage of judges -- means that in reality , the meeting rarely takes place within a day			0
a murder charge carries a potential death penalty in @entity1 , and suspects can be detained indefinitely , according to the law -- " as long as necessary for the investigation to proceed until the examining magistrate or criminal court issues a decision on the case on completion of the preliminary or judicial investigation or the trial			1
" many @entity1 detainees are held for long periods without charges			2
once the investigation is complete , the case can be dismissed if the judge decides the evidence against a suspect is insufficient			2
if the judge deems the evidence strong enough , the judge refers the case to the trial chamber of the court			1
the chamber can accept the case or send it back for further investigation			0
if the chamber accepts the case , a three - judge panel is assembled for trial and charges the suspect			2
in the @entity1 legal system , as in several other countries , jury trials do not exist			1
but as in most systems , the accused have a right to defense attorneys and attorneys are appointed for them if necessary			0
cases like these would be handled by the @entity10			0
the court has recently come under fire from @entity105 , which in a report issued in december said the court " is seriously failing to meet international standards of due process and fair trials			1
" defendants are detained for long periods before trial with no judicial review , according to the human rights organization , and " are not able to pursue a meaningful defense or challenge evidence against them			0
abuse in detention , typically with the aim of extracting confessions , appears common			0
" in addition , defendants sometimes have substandard counsel , and the court frequently relies " on the testimony of secret informants and confessions likely to have been extracted under duress			0
" in addition , the @entity129 last month urged @entity1 to impose a moratorium on the death penalty , saying its justice system could not guarantee fair trials			1
@entity1 @entity136 spokesman @entity135 , however , told @entity2 that if the evidence against the men warrants it , they will receive a fair trial and will have the right to defend themselves with " as many lawyers as they like , " either @entity1 or @entity4			1
those convicted of murder are executed by hanging			0
death sentences , as well as sentences of life in prison , are automatically appealed			0
@entity2 's @entity151 contributed to this report .			0
