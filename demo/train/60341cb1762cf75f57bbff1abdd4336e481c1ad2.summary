for weeks now , i 've been warning viewers about the video i 'm about to show them			0
they are horrific images from the conflict in @entity6 -- images of blood - stained walls , butchered children and dead babies			1
on air , i preface the footage with an emphatic warning : " they are disturbing and not appropriate for all viewers			0
but given the nature of the attack and the number of dead , we believe showing them is necessary to convey the extent of this atrocity			0
" opposition groups say almost 13,000 people have died since the uprising began more than a year ago , with countless more wounded			1
photojournalist @entity25 risked his life to document the human toll in the besieged @entity6 city of @entity29			1
his footage takes you inside the makeshift hospitals where doctors and medics work under appalling conditions			0
you see the blood - soaked mattresses			2
you see the bloodied children			2
you hear their wailing mothers			0
@entity6 rebels turn to homemade bombs @entity25 tells me in the 20 years he 's been covering conflict , he has never photographed so many wounded children			1
he wants his footage to tell the story of the @entity6 people to the wider public			1
" i also hope these images can be a historical reference to prosecute @entity52 for war crimes against humanity , " he said			2
the unaltered image is the ultimate portrayal of reality			0
it depicts the terror on the ground and the urgent need for help			0
but can it stop the bloodshed ? @entity66 monitors find @entity6 ghost town this month is the 40th anniversary of one of the most unforgettable images of modern conflict			1
it 's the @entity73 - winning photo of nine - year - old @entity74 taken during the @entity75 on june 8 , 1972			1
she is naked and running , her clothes and layers of skin melted away by napalm			0
he also helped the young girl get treatment for her injuries			0

veteran photo editor @entity98 , who died in may this year , once said : " it changed the war			1
i met so many @entity102 soldiers who said ' @entity103 because of your picture i 'll get to go home early			0
' " a single snapshot can depict the truth of conflict and drive commitment to end the violence			2
but that 's not the case for @entity6			1
thanks to video clips uploaded by opposition activists to @entity117 and the work of journalists like @entity25 , we have -- for months -- witnessed the constant death , pain and suffering inside @entity6			1
and yet , there is diplomatic deadlock at the @entity66			0
a massacre is followed by reports of another mass killing			0
the conflict drags on and on and on			2
@entity25 has given @entity6 's victims a human face with his footage			1
but he 's more horrified by the public apathy than the atrocities he 's captured on video			2
" i 've never experienced such an indifference with the public , " he told me with an exasperated sigh			0
i 've photographed children wounded in @entity140 and moved nations into action			1
but here in @entity6 , you have wounded children everyday and nobody seems to care			1

but these stirring images have failed to stir any meaningful action .			2
