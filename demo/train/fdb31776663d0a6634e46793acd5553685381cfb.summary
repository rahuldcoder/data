editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is @entity5 's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology			0
the reports , which are being produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- in april of last year the @entity24 semi-submersible @entity23 exploded in the @entity25 , killing 11 men , injuring 17 others and triggering what is generally recognized as one of the greatest human errors ever made and officially the largest unforeseen marine oil catastrophe since people started drilling for oil			2
by the time the leak was capped in july 2010 , enough oil to fill 4.9 million barrels covered the @entity25 in a toxic slick			2

after visiting the oil spill in june 2010 , the young engineer decided to leave @entity43 in @entity44 to develop an open source oil spill cleaning robot , @entity46			1
our current array of oil spill skimming technologies â € ” mostly private boats retrofitted with skimming equipment and skimmers maintained by the @entity54 â € ” are only able to collect three percent of the oil in the @entity25 and carry health risks to humans and heavy economic costs			1
@entity46 is unmanned , autonomous , relatively inexpensive and open hardware ( anybody can use , modify and distribute its designs ) , making it a potentially powerful weapon in the battle to clean up the @entity25 while preserving the safety of the workers who would otherwise be exposed to the toxic mess			1
already @entity40 imagines other uses for the sailboat drone , like oceanography and surveillance			2
in the first episode of our " upgrade " series , @entity71 goes to @entity76 to watch @entity40 's ragtag team of scientists and engineers as they hustle to assemble the first @entity46 prototype and dodge the @entity82 harbor patrol for their first water test .			1

@entity40 left @entity43 to *pursue* the project after visiting the 2010 @entity25 oil spill
