@entity0 , @entity1 -- the 3,200 passengers aboard the @entity5 cruise liner were enjoying a night of entertainment and relaxation off @entity1 's @entity9 coast			1
then , at about dinnertime , the lights went out , an ominous scraping sound moaned through the hull , and the ship tilted to one side			1
the 1,500 - cabin luxury vessel , which was also carrying about 1,000 crew members , had run aground on a rocky sandbar off the tiny island of @entity20			1
@entity21 overwhelmed passengers and crew alike when , as the ship listed and water rose as if it were a scene from " @entity26 , " everyone realized that only one side of the ship 's lifeboats and rafts were reachable			1
amid screams , the crew appeared helpless , according to one passenger who had to make a ladder of rope to save himself and his wife			1
" it was the @entity42 brothers watching these guys trying to figure out how to work the boat , " said @entity37 , who was on the @entity5 for his honeymoon with his wife , @entity39			2
the couple live in @entity46			2
" i felt like the disaster itself was manageable , " @entity37 added , referring to the grounding and tilting of the ship , " but i felt like the crew was going to kill us			1
" the worst part came when a lifeboat crew member told everyone , " women and children first , " @entity37 said			1
" all these families who were clinging to each other had to be separated , " he added			1
after helping passengers , some crew members jumped overboard and swam ashore			1
search continues for missing passengers at least three lifeboats apparently malfunctioned due to technical or crew error , @entity37 said			1
life rafts were " twisting and turning , " and the crew pulled in some rafts and put the people back on the ship , but the crew never returned for them , @entity37 said			1
with the ship 's staircases flooded , " we made ladders out of ropes to climb down from the outer fourth deck to the third deck , " @entity37 said			1
" we waited clinging to those rope ladders for 3Â½ hours " before being picked up by a lifeboat that returned from dropping passengers onshore , he said			1
@entity37 said he and his wife never heard from any of the officers or captain during the incident			2
the couple was eventually transported by bus to a hotel in @entity88			2
" i 've been awake for 40 hours -- i still have never spoken to a person from @entity94 , " he said , adding that no food , clothes , or money were provided by the cruise line			1
many passengers complained about how the cruise ship staff handled the crisis and asked why they had not yet received an obligatory safety briefing when disaster struck , only hours into their journey			1
" we attended a safety presentation on the first day , " but he says it did n't turn out to have any safety information , he said			2
" it was only a sales pitch " for shore excursions , @entity37 said			1
