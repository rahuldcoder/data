-- without action from @entity4 , on january 2 , 2013 , the @entity2 defense budget will undergo the most dramatic and dangerous cuts in its history			1
because of the failure of the supercommittee to agree on a deficit reduction plan , the @entity7 automatically cuts about $ 500 billion from the defense budget			1
these cuts fall on top of the already agreed - upon $ 487 billion in reductions			2
@entity14 told , the cuts would amount to about $ 1 trillion over a decade			2
the results would be nothing short of catastrophic			0
but do n't take my word for it			2
on november 14 , 2011 , secretary of defense @entity21 wrote a letter to sens. @entity23 and @entity24 explaining the ramifications of the full sequestration defense cuts			1
should these cuts take place over the next 10 years , he said , the @entity2 would be left with its smallest ground force since @entity30 ; the smallest @entity31 since 1915 ; the smallest fighter force in the history of the @entity34 ; and the smallest civilian work force in the @entity37 's history			0
gen. @entity38 , the assistant commandant of the marine corps , testified on @entity40 in may that such cuts would leave the corps without " adequate capabilities and capacities to meet a single major contingency operation			0
" national defense is only 20 % of the budget , yet the sequester subjects it to 50 % of the automatic cuts			1
the other $ 500 billion will be cut from domestic programs			1
sequestration , which both @entity53 and @entity54 voted for , was intended to spur @entity4 to responsible action ; it was never meant to be an effective deficit - reduction tool			1
no doctor operates with a pickax , unless , of course , he intends to maim his patient			0
who 's to blame for threat of defense budget cuts ? last week on my radio show , " morning in @entity2 , " sen. @entity24 said the full brunt of these cuts would mean " no more f - 35s , no more modern fighters " and " it means that those who are serving in the military will be sent off to future wars ill - equipped and unprepared			1
" leaders on both sides of the aisle agree : sequestration cuts will gut the world 's greatest military			1
@entity4 can not , and must not , allow this to happen			1
and yet , the president and his administration seem preoccupied with leveraging defense cuts for political gamesmanship			2
last week , the @entity84 sent a letter to @entity40 saying it would exempt all military personnel from the cuts , thereby avoiding the political fallout from military voters and ensuring that the bulk of the cuts come to equipment , readiness , and weapons			2
we may have an army , but , if the cuts happen , little to arm them with			0
the remainder of the cuts will fall on the @entity37 's wide network of contractors			0
in a recent study , the @entity102 found that the sequester cuts could eliminate more than 2 million jobs and add 1.5 % to the unemployment rate			2
such massive layoffs made in anticipation of the budget cuts and before an election would be disastrous , especially in swing states , like @entity112 , whose economies depend heavily on defense contractors			1
knowing full well the political fiasco this would be , the @entity118 administration 's @entity116 issued a memo advising defense industry contractors to ignore the @entity123 , which requires federal contractors to issue layoff notices 60 days before , meaning they would land in employees ' hands four days before the november 6 election			0
rep. @entity130 , chairman of the @entity131 , fired back at the @entity84 and told contractors to ignore the @entity116			0
on tuesday , the @entity84 finally agreed to detail exactly where these massive cuts will come from within the @entity37 and from domestic programs			0
the president signed the bill only after the @entity138 - led @entity137 unanimously passed the @entity54 - led @entity84 's @entity139 , which requires the @entity84 to inform @entity140 and the public exactly how and where the sequestration cuts will be made			0
now that the cuts will be disclosed in full view , one can not believe the president would go against the wishes of his own secretary of defense and generals and allow the military to be subjected to these traumatic cuts and massive layoffs			1
rather , the president seems to be engaging @entity54 in a high - stakes game of chicken -- his demands , like tax hikes on the wealthiest @entity2 , or the threat of sequestration			1
republicans should n't yield , but call this what it is -- reckless and dangerous politicking			0
after all , the president is the commander - in - chief			0
if he takes credit for the death of @entity165 , he takes responsibility for welfare of the military and the safety of @entity2			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			2

@entity172 : on january 2 , the defense budget will automatically be cut by about $ 500b
@entity172 : " sequestration " was meant to spur @entity4 to make a responsible deal
now it threatens to gut military , he says . defense secretary , generals , politicians do n't want it
@entity4 must stop playing politics , he says , agree to budget deal to end the threat
