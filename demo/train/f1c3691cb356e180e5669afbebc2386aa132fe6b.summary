-- former fbi director @entity2 will lead an independent inquiry for @entity4 into the school 's response to child sex abuse allegations , trustee @entity1 said monday			1
" no one -- no one -- is above scrutiny , including every member of the administration of the university , every member of our board of trustees , and every employee of the university , " said @entity1 , who was appointed to chair the special investigative committee into the university 's response to allegations involving former assistant football coach @entity13			2
a grand jury reported this month that university officials allegedly knew of allegations of misconduct on @entity13 's part , but failed to fully act on them			2
@entity2 , who will serve as special investigative counsel , said he extracted pledges of support and non-interference from university officials before taking on the job			1
" this assurance is the main condition of my engagement , " he said			0
he said will appoint a team of former @entity40 agents and former federal prosecutors from his law firm to assist			1
results of the investigation will be released to trustees and the public at about the same time , he said			2
it 's unclear how effective @entity2 will be , said @entity0 senior legal analyst @entity48			1
" @entity2 is an honorable person , but the question is whether he will have the tools to do a thorough investigation			1
with police , the university and even @entity13 's former charity , @entity57 , conducting their own investigations , it 's unclear whether witnesses will want to repeat their stories over and over again , he said			1
at the heart of the scandal are accusations that @entity13 , the retired defensive coordinator for the @entity4 football team , sexually abused a boy at the university football complex , and that law enforcement officials were not notified			1
according to grand jury documents , a graduate assistant told head football coach @entity70 in 2002 that he had seen @entity13 performing anal sex on a young boy in a football complex shower			2
@entity70 told athletic director @entity74 , who told @entity75 , a university vice president			2
some information about the allegations eventually reached president @entity78 , according to the grand jury			0
@entity70 has said he did " what i was supposed to do			0
" but in a later statement , he said " with the benefit of hindsight , i wish i had done more			0
" while it took years for the alleged abuse to become public , school officials moved quickly after prosecutors charged @entity13 , 67 , with 40 counts in the alleged sexual abuse of eight young boys over several years			2
authorities also charged @entity74 and @entity92 with misleading the grand jury investigating the allegations and failing to report suspected abuse			0
@entity74 and @entity92 stepped aside within a day of the charges , and before the week was out , trustees had fired both @entity70 -- the winningest football coach in @entity100 history -- and @entity78			0
the university 's special committee , created six days after @entity13 's arrest , empowered @entity2 to " take his team 's work to wherever it leads , " @entity1 said			1
the @entity106 and the @entity108 @entity107 are also investigating the university 's response			0
@entity2 said he did not know how much the investigation will cost , or how long it will take , other than that it will be lengthy			1
investigators had already begun work reviewing documents in the case , he said			0
while he does not have the subpoena power he enjoyed as an @entity40 official , @entity2 said he is counting on the cooperation of law enforcement and the @entity4 community , which is eager to restore the university 's reputation			1
" in my current role , i will encourage everyone to speak to us , " he said			0
@entity1 said the scandal has caused irreparable harm to the school , but officials are determined to make sure it never happens again			0
" words alone can not express the heartbreak and sorrow we feel for the victims , " he said .			0
