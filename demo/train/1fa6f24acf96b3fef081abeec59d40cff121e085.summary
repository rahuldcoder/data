@entity0 -- @entity3 author @entity2 has won this year 's @entity4 for " @entity5 , " set in the aftermath of the @entity8 occupation of @entity3			1
" this comes as a huge shock			0
it 's such a strong list that i 'm speechless , " said @entity2 , who beat four other shortlisted books to win the $ 30,000 prize			1
the shortlist included some big names -- @entity17 laureate @entity16 , " @entity18 " , @entity20 poet and writer @entity21 , " @entity22 " , @entity23 , " @entity24 " and @entity25 , " @entity26 "			0
@entity16 was the only one not to attend the formal black - tie dinner at @entity0 's @entity28			2
@entity30 journalist and literary critic @entity29 , who chaired the panel of judges , championed the book for working on so many levels and with so many themes while also being a tale driven by mystery			0
" why is this woman the sole survivor of a @entity8 labor camp ? what happened to her sister ? what happened to the landscape artist who was the gardener to the emperor ? " she said			0
also on the judging panel , novelist @entity46 drew attention to the formal structuring of the novel that mirrors the novel 's central metaphor			0
" it 's elegant in the same way that the garden is and its shape finally gives you a vision of the entire thing , " he said			0
@entity2 grew up in @entity3 and studied law , going on to specialize in property law at one of @entity64 's leading law firms			1
but he had nurtured a secret desire to write since his childhood and in his early 30s took the opportunity for a " gap year " -- studying for a masters at @entity70			0
he wrote his first book , " @entity71 , " while doing his masters			0
that book went on to be longlisted for the @entity74			0
after a year of book festivals and promoting the book he settled down to write " @entity78 " and spent years crafting the novel , revising the text and moving the scenes about until he felt he had achieved the right balance			1
" when i was writing the book i suddenly realized that gardening is like creative writing -- the pruning , deciding where to put your sentence , your comma , where to begin the next paragraph , " the 40 - year - old said			0
" @entity5 " was shortlisted for the @entity74 2012 , as was " @entity22 "			1
@entity2 jokingly referred to @entity21 as his " travel companion " as they have attended many of the same festivals and prize presentations over the last six months			1
attending the formal prize dinner for the last time were representatives from the @entity102 that has sponsored the prize for the last six years			1
chair of the prize 's board of directors , professor @entity107 , said that a number of parties had expressed interest in sponsoring the prize and they were talking seriously to three			2
" all i can say at the moment is that the response has been encouraging and we are encouraged , " said @entity107 , adding that he hopes to make an announcement at the end of april			0
the prize was initially awarded for an as yet unpublished book , but after three years was changed to make it the prize for the best novel of the year by an @entity122 writer that is either written in @entity124 or translated into @entity124			1
the revised format means that people can read the long and shortlists ahead of the prize , and booksellers see a spike in sales for the listed books , especially the winner			2
@entity133 , manager of retail operations at @entity135 , said : " the profile of the prize grows each year and we expect that at some point it will reach the same levels as the @entity74			2
" this year saw a record 108 entries , up from 90 last year and 54 in 2010			1
" we 're now into the ballpark of the @entity74 in terms of number of entries , " said @entity107			0
last year 's winner , ' @entity146 " by @entity149 writer @entity148 , has sold more than two million copies worldwide			1
the prize has inspired a " shadow jury " of four book bloggers -- two in @entity153 and two in @entity155 -- who review and blog about the books and announce their winner two days before the real jury does			2
last year the @entity161 picked " @entity146 " and this year they chose " @entity22 " as their favorite .			1
