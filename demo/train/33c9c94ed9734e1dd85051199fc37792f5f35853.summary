" @entity1 sees such extraterritorial measures as unacceptable and against international law , " the statement says			0
" such a practice seriously obstructs advancement toward a constructive dialogue with @entity6			0
stronger sanction pressure , which some of our partners see almost as a goal in itself , will not encourage @entity3 to sit down at the negotiating table			0

the @entity9 also said @entity3 is a " primary money laundering concern			1
" @entity32 said she expects additional sanctions by other international partners and that taken together " these measures represent a significant ratcheting up of pressure on @entity3 , its sources of income and its illegal activities			2
" @entity11 cut all financial ties with @entity3 , the first time it has cut an entire country 's banking sector off from @entity11 finance , the @entity42 announced earlier on monday			1
similarly , @entity12 said it was implementing a series of tougher sanctions , prohibiting almost all financial transactions with the @entity3 government			1
the moves come days after an @entity55 report highlighted new concerns about " the possible military dimensions of @entity3 's nuclear program , " the @entity42 statement said monday			2
@entity3 says its nuclear program is peaceful and has called the @entity62 watchdog 's report " unbalanced " and " politically motivated			2
" " the @entity55 's report last week provided further credible and detailed evidence about the possible military dimensions of the @entity3 nuclear program , " @entity11 foreign secretary @entity63 said in a statement			1
" today we have responded resolutely by introducing a set of new sanctions that prohibit all business with @entity3 banks			1
" @entity12 foreign affairs minister @entity73 also cited the recent @entity55 report as " yet more proof that the current regime in @entity6 poses the most significant threats to global peace and security today			0
" " @entity12 is implementing , as of right now , a series of even tougher measures under the @entity82			2
these expanded sanctions prohibit almost all financial transactions with the @entity3 government , add individuals and entities to the list of designated persons and expand the list of prohibited goods , " he said in a statement			1
also monday @entity95 president @entity94 sent a letter to various leaders and heads of state , urging " new sanctions of unprecedented magnitude to convince @entity3 that it must negotiate , " according to a statement			2
@entity95 recommended that the @entity102 and its member states , as well as the @entity9 , @entity104 , @entity12 and other willing countries , freeze the asset of @entity3 's @entity107 and suspend purchases of @entity3 oil			1
@entity3 's nuclear program , the @entity95 president said , risks nuclear proliferation and " could spark a military escalation in the region with catastrophic consequences for @entity3 and for the world			2
" @entity117 denies bunker - busting bomb is intended for @entity3 the @entity102 already has an extensive set of sanctions in place			0
@entity95 , as one of the member states , is pushing to increase them			0
according to @entity125 diplomats , next week the @entity102 is expected to pass further sanctions similar to what the @entity9 announced , but @entity95 wants the international community to move beyond that , collectively			1
@entity9 officials had been considering action against the @entity132 but became concerned that a full sanction could have a negative effect on the world economy because of the potential impact on oil prices			0
a number of congressional members have been calling for sanctions against the bank amid questions about how much the current restrictions are working			0
@entity9 sanctions already prohibited @entity9 companies from doing business with @entity3			1
" let me be clear : today 's actions do not exhaust our opportunities to sanction @entity3			0
we continue actively to consider a range of increasingly aggressive measures , " said @entity32			0
following monday 's announcement , senior officials with the @entity154 spoke to reporters on a conference call , stressing the decision to designate an entire jurisdiction , like @entity3 , as a " primary money laundering concern " is rare			0
the action will create a chilling effect and should serve as a wake - up call to banks and financial institutions around the world still doing business with @entity3 , they said			1
on friday , the @entity55 board of governors issued a resolution expressing " deep and increasing concern about the unresolved issues regarding the @entity3 nuclear program			0
" but the @entity62 agency 's resolution did not threaten action to curb @entity3 's nuclear ambitions			0
