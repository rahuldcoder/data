according to sources , the alleged prostitutes -- the youngest of whom were in their early 20s -- signed in at @entity27			2
one of these women , @entity29 , allegedly was later involved in a dispute about how much she was to be paid for the night , which brought the entire incident to light			0
@entity29 , 24 , through a statement credited to her attorney , said she was an escort , not a prostitute			0

a woman who identified herself as a family friend called the situation " heartbreaking			1
" " i know him and his character , " she said of @entity18			0
" i would question the allegations			2
" also friday , the @entity3 distributed new rules for its agents on assignment intended to prevent a repeat of such alleged misconduct , according to two government sources familiar with the resulting investigation			1
@entity74 misses @entity76 deadline called @entity80 , the new guidelines given to all @entity3 personnel make clear that standards of behavior required in the @entity83 apply on missions abroad , the sources said			1
effective immediately , the new standards require detailed briefings before each trip that will include safety precautions and any necessary designations of establishments and areas that are " off limits " for @entity3 personnel , the sources said			1
also in the new standards , foreigners are banned from @entity3 hotel rooms at all times , except for hotel staff and host nation law enforcement and government officials on official business , according to the officials , and all @entity3 personnel are prohibited from going to a " non-reputable establishment			1
" the new standards specify that @entity83 laws apply to @entity3 personnel when traveling , rendering invalid the excuse that specific activity is legal in the foreign country , the officials said			1
in addition , the new guidelines allow moderate alcohol consumption when off duty , but prohibit alcohol consumption within 10 hours of reporting for duty or at any time when at the hotel where the protected official is staying , the officials explained			0
an additional supervisor from the @entity121 will now accompany the " jump teams " that bring vehicles for motorcades and other transportation , the officials said			0
agents involved in the @entity6 incident were part of such a jump team			2
first word of the new regulations came thursday night , when @entity133 rep. @entity132 of @entity134 outlined them on @entity1 's " @entity136 " after meeting with @entity3 director @entity137 about the scandal that has embarrassed the 147 - year - old agency and raised questions about possible security breaches			1
allegations of further transgressions by agents have emerged after the initial reports of heavy drinking and consorting with prostitutes this month before president @entity148 arrived in @entity13 for the @entity149			1
new claims include an account from @entity152 described by @entity1 affiliate @entity155 tv station @entity154 as very similar to the @entity6 scandal , involving members of the @entity3 and other government agencies			1
a @entity83 government official , speaking on condition of not being identified , acknowledged there had been missteps among @entity3 members			1
such problems are to be expected over the agency 's long history and do n't necessarily reflect a systemic or cultural issue , the official said			2
" we have had employees that have engaged in misconduct , " the official said			0
" meanwhile , a congressional source said thursday that reports of other incidents involving members of the agency , which is charged with protecting the president and other top officials as well as investigating criminal activity , have been brought to the attention of @entity184			2
that includes the alleged incident in @entity152 , which the @entity3 has told @entity184 it is looking into as well , according to the congressional source			1
the @entity154 report cited an unnamed @entity83 government contractor who worked extensively with the @entity3 advance team in @entity191 before @entity148 's trip there in march 2011			2
the source said he was with about a dozen @entity3 agents and a few @entity83 military specialists at a strip club in the city a few days before @entity148 arrived			1
the men drank heavily at the club , and most of them paid extra for access to a vip section where they were provided sexual favors in return for cash , the source told the station			0
the station reported that the strip club 's owner corroborated the allegations			2
the owner confirmed that a large number of agents , and some military escorts , " descended on his club " that week and were there at least three nights in a row , @entity154 reported			2
the owner said his club routinely takes care of high - ranking employees of the @entity226 in @entity191 as well as visiting agents from the @entity228 and @entity229 , @entity154 said			2
the government contractor source said he told the agents it was a " really bad idea " to take the strippers back to their hotel rooms , but several agents bragged that they " did this all the time " and " not to worry about it , " @entity154 reported			2
@entity154 investigative reporter @entity238 told the @entity240 show " @entity241 " on thursday that he considers his source very credible , and he later told @entity1 that he had checked billing records , receipts , credentials and other information to confirm the contractor was with the @entity3 in @entity248 at the time of the incident			2
@entity252 ex-prostitute plans to sue @entity83 embassy the source told him about the alleged scandal last year , while @entity238 was in @entity152 on a different story			0
@entity238 said he pressed for details at that time , but the man did n't want any information from him to be used then in a news story			0
after the allegations involving @entity3 agents in @entity6 surfaced , @entity261 again pressed his source , who this time agreed to the use of his account in the @entity154 report			1
@entity270 , manager of @entity272 club and restaurant , said friday that she can not be certain secret service agents were there			0
@entity270 said : " it is not ethical for any of our security or for me as a person to be in the entrance and question you : ' excuse me , where are you from ? what nationality do you have ? what do you do as a profession ? what kind of work do you do ? ' " responding to the @entity154 report , @entity3 spokesman @entity288 said , " the recent investigation in @entity13 has generated several news stories that contain allegations by mostly unnamed sources			1
any information brought to our attention that can be assessed as credible will be followed up on in an appropriate manner			0
" @entity1 can not independently confirm the allegations			0
defense secretary @entity299 said thursday that his department is not investigating any of its troops over the reported incident in @entity152			0
but the @entity304 is questioning its embassy staff in @entity152 about the allegations , spokeswoman @entity303 said thursday			0
the @entity229 also is prepared to look into , " in an appropriate manner and immediately , " allegations that it deems " credible " regarding its agents in @entity152 , agency spokesman @entity307 said			1
but he added that , while the @entity229 has seen news reports , " we are unaware of any allegations of misconduct			0
" sen. @entity76 of @entity316 -- the top @entity317 on the @entity318 , which received a briefing on the @entity6 scandal this week by @entity322 secretary @entity321 -- said the @entity154 report " only reaffirms the need for independent investigations by the ( @entity322 's independent ) inspector general			0
" appearing on @entity1 on friday , @entity76 said he had yet to get a response from the @entity74 to his request for further information			0
nine @entity3 members have resigned or are being forced out as a result of the scandal over the alleged events in @entity6			1
the military has launched its own investigation into 12 members who were in @entity6 in advance of @entity148 's visit			0
