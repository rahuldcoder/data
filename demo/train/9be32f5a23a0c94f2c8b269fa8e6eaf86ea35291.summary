@entity1 , @entity2 -- " i 'm a big history buff , " president @entity0 said in an interview with @entity7 " @entity6			0
" and i think that understanding the history of the @entity10 and understanding the history of the @entity12 is something that every @entity14 and every young @entity14 should be part of			1
" i am sometimes asked the same question that mr. @entity6 put to president @entity0 : why study @entity10 history ? and i agree with the president 's response			1
as we approach the 150th anniversary of the @entity12 , we look back to its centennial in the 1960s			0
a lot has happened in this country since then , and our appreciation of the lessons of history has changed with the times			0
one constant has been the importance of the @entity12			0
it remains as the most important era of @entity14 history , a time when @entity14 withstood its biggest challenges to a constitutional democracy which then was still viewed as an experiment in a new form of government			1
the crucible of war defined the nation as we know it today , as we became " indivisible " and " with liberty and justice for all " for the first time			2
during the 1960s , we @entity48 looked at the war as it occurred on the battlefields , because the conduct and course of the war dominated every single moment of every day			0
and the @entity10 soldiers have historically captured our fascination even more than the @entity60 soldiers			1
perhaps it is the gallantry and dash of leaders like @entity64 or @entity65 or @entity66			0
or perhaps it was the common enlisted men in the @entity10 ranks , whose valor and courage -- in the face of tremendous privation and against overwhelming odds -- makes them stand out in world history as one of the best bodies of soldiers ever known			1
another perspective on the @entity10 and history if the fascination with soldiers continues from the 1960s to today , what has changed ? today , the study of @entity10 history is much more " inclusive " -- to use the word of choice for many state 's 150th anniversary commissions -- as we look more deeply into the past			1
today we ask different questions of history and i think we get better answers			1
let me list just a few of those questions			2
what about slavery ? we did not talk much about it in the 1960s			2
today , we can not study the @entity10 without studying 40 percent of its population			1
so now we look long and hard at this aspect of @entity14 history , including its existence and importance in the @entity108			1
we see so clearly today that it was a wrong , so we need to ask why so many people 150 years ago did not see it as wrong and why several of the important christian denominations split apart over this issue before the country itself split			2
what about the slaves themselves ? why did many take advantage of the first opportunity to escape to freedom while others remained " loyal " to the @entity122 ? and what about the 400,000 african - americans in the @entity122 who were free long before @entity125 came on the scene ? ireporter : @entity12 history could have been " teachable moment " what about the @entity122 who remained loyal to the @entity60 and chose to fight in blue , rather than gray ? what about the thousands of immigrants who " escaped " the wars of @entity136 yet enlisted in both armies to demonstrate their loyalty to their new country ? at the opposite end of the spectrum , what about the @entity48 who had been here long before any @entity136 , yet allied with the @entity10 ? the last @entity10 brigade to surrender was composed entirely of @entity48 and commanded by brigadier general @entity145 , a full - blooded @entity146			1
what about the very important @entity149 community in the @entity122 ? many served in the ranks while others saw civilian service , such as @entity154 , who had three different @entity156 posts , or @entity157 , who became the head nurse at @entity159 , the biggest hospital in the world			0
and what about the women of the @entity122 ? the war thrust them into new positions of responsibility and many continued after the war to lead public enterprises that engendered self - esteem and respect			0
we @entity48 -- from native americans to those who have ancestors who wore the blue or gray to those who are descended from slaves to those who have recently come to our shores -- want to know ourselves			0
we want to understand why our country is different from the others around the world			0
this is why millions of @entity48 read so many books about the @entity12 or visit the battlefields or come to museums like @entity187 so that they can see first hand the ingredients that formed us			0
and this is why so many foreigners come to @entity14 to visit those same sites in order to understand why we are who we are			1
the fact is that we must know the @entity12 if we are to know @entity14			2
and to know the @entity12 , we must know and understand the @entity10 -- in all of its diversity			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200			0

@entity202 : understanding the @entity10 *key* to knowing how the @entity14 has *evolved*
today 's @entity10 studies cover slavery and many other questions , he says
millions want to learn more about the @entity10 , he says
