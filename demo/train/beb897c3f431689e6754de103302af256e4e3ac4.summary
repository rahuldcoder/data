you ca n't get a new @entity3 6 or @entity2 until friday , but @entity4 8 , the latest version of @entity7 's mobile operating system , went live on wednesday			1
the free download is available to anyone with an @entity10 , 5 , @entity11 or @entity12			0
@entity4 8 is n't the radical upgrade that @entity14 was , but it has a handful of new features that you 're bound to enjoy			1
here 's a look at a few of our favorites			2
( is there another feature you 're looking forward to using ? let us know in the comments			0
) device continuity when @entity7 's @entity30 operating system , @entity29 , is released , probably in late october , it will pair with @entity4 8 for the tightest integration ever between devices			1
users will be able to do things like answer phone calls on their laptop , receive texts on a desktop computer and move a document in progress from an iphone to an @entity42 to a computer with a single swipe			0
@entity4 8 : how to get it , and whether you should that feature , called @entity47 , works with apps including @entity49 , messages , @entity51			1
widgets until now , @entity7 has kept strict controls on how apps -- other than its own -- appear on the @entity3 and @entity42			1
basically , they get a tiny , uniformly sized box for each app , and that 's that			0
but in @entity59 , it has given developers the ability to create widgets for the devices			0
now , they 'll be able to create simple , standalone tools for things like checking the weather or monitoring data usage			0
but the function , which has long been available on @entity70 devices , will be limited to the " today " screen under the device 's @entity72			2
keyboard changes @entity7 says @entity4 8 brings the biggest changes to the system 's keyboard since the @entity3 was introduced			1
for one , @entity7 will begin allowing third - party typing apps , so tools like @entity81 , the finger - dragging system popular on @entity70 , will be coming soon			1
the system 's native typing system will get some tweaks too , largely in the form of @entity87 , a @entity88 - style predictive text system			2
the system will predict the next word you want to type based on what you 've written in the past and let you add the entire word with a single tap			0
its predictions will change based on the people you 're communicating with and the format you 're using ( say , email vs. text )			0
what 's that song ? @entity104 is now integrated with @entity105 , an app that recognizes music and other media playing around it			0
@entity4 8 users will be able to simply ask @entity104 " what song is playing ? " and get everyone 's favorite digital assistant 's best guess			1
family sharing @entity7 wants you to have one big happy @entity3 and @entity42 - using family			1
in the new system , up to six people will be able to share purchases from @entity120 , @entity121 and the @entity122 without having to share a single account			2
@entity114 also automatically creates a family photo album , letting anyone on the plan share to it			0
there 's a shared family calendar so anyone ( ok , let 's face it , so @entity132 ... ) can keep everyone abreast of plans and an " ask to buy " function that automatically pings parents , letting them give or withhold permission when a child tries to buy something from @entity7			2
