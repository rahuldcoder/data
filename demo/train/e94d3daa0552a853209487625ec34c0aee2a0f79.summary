@entity0 -- @entity2 , chess expert and @entity4 billionaire , is turning his hand to a new business : @entity8 - era art. @entity2 , a 40 - year old professional chess player and businessman , is investing in his love of @entity12 art by scouting the world for pieces created behind the @entity15			1
the @entity17 - born businessman , valued by @entity18 at $ 1.3 billion and ranked as @entity4 's 68th richest person , has invested heavily in @entity4 infrastructure through his co-ownership of @entity22			1
but over the last five years , he has spent $ 100 million collecting @entity8 artworks , hoping to gather enough to eventually open a museum			0
@entity2 's pieces -- including 1951 's " @entity26 , " by @entity27 , 1930 's " daisies " by @entity29 and 1893 's " @entity30 " by @entity31 -- have been collected from around the world , where they were scattered to gather dust after the fall of the @entity15 in 1991			1
" when the @entity12 collapsed , a huge amount of great artworks were taken out of the country to the west and elsewhere , " @entity2 says			1
" my task is to buy these artworks and show them to people			0
" @entity27 is one of the @entity12 's most famed painters of the so - called socialist realist genre , which was sponsored by the state			1
he was commissioned by the @entity12 's communist leader @entity46 to create " @entity51 , " a warm depiction of a family receiving news from the front line			2
the original piece , painted in 1947 , won the @entity53 and remains in the @entity55 in @entity56			0
@entity2 's version , painted after @entity46 requested a second version of the artwork to show to the world , was found by chance in the @entity62 by his art dealer , @entity64			1
despite being critiqued as propaganda for its representations of life under @entity46 's dictatorship , socialist realism has enjoyed a renaissance as those living in former @entity8 countries seek artifacts from the previous era			1
for @entity2 , " @entity26 " reminds him of his grandfather @entity76 , who died in 1943 as the @entity12 fought the @entity77 in the bloody battles of the @entity79			2
he wo n't reveal how much the artwork cost but says it is an " emotional painting " that allows him to imagine what it must have been like waiting for news from loved ones during wartime			0
@entity2 was a student in @entity87 when the @entity12 fell and recalls being stunned by the news that his country did n't exist anymore			2
it was a " love for the lost motherland , " that prompted him to start collecting the era 's art. @entity2 says he is " aware of what kind of empire i lived in , that many times this empire , the leaders put the world at risk of world war			1
" but , he adds , " you ca n't not recognize the achievements of the @entity12			0
so i believe that the most important thing here is an objective view of the achievements , and the experience of that short and bright empire			0
" @entity110 points to the technical achievements of the artists in fields such as realism and impressionism , despite living under a repressive regime			0
" the artworks are reflections of the time and that era of a country that does n't exist any more , " she says			0
@entity2 wants to collect up to 12 new artworks a year , primarily from the period 1917 to 1991 , for the @entity123			1
he intends to loan the pieces to museums and art galleries , exhibit and promote around the world			0
@entity2 has previously merged his love of chess and art by sponsoring this year 's @entity132 at @entity56 's @entity133			1
@entity2 says he will continue to invest in art as long as his business -- which he built up in the 1990s and now straddles shipping , ports and infrastructure -- allows			2
and despite his interest in the past , @entity2 says @entity4 have never " lived more freely or prosperously than today			2
never have our people been so free , not only in movement but in political choice			0
