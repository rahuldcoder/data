@entity0 , a biracial , former @entity1 - turned - @entity3 - educated attorney in her 30s , would seem to be the type of congressional candidate the @entity6 would break its neck to back in a race			1
but , as she barnstormed across @entity11 ' 13th @entity10 in a maverick effort to defeat first - term incumbent rep. @entity13 in march 's primary , @entity9 came face - to - face with an extreme example of the types of challenges female @entity6 congressional hopefuls sometimes face			1
in @entity9 's case , she was shut out and , ultimately , shut down			0
her requests for party data on voters who had previously cast ballots in @entity6 primaries was denied , according to media reports			1
she was shunned at political functions and potential donors were warned to stay away , she said			0
@entity6 officials told @entity9 to consider running for another office			1
" she chose to run against a sitting member of @entity36 , " @entity31 , spokeswoman for the @entity32 , a @entity6 organization which helps candidates seeking congressional office , said last week			1
" there were plenty of other races she was encouraged to run for			2
we 're a member - driven organization			0
" women 's work : the @entity6 's glass ceiling @entity46 @entity6 chairman @entity45 was forced to step down from his post and apologize after he called @entity9 a " street walker " in an email to the editor of @entity51 , an online newsletter , and declared " @entity13 will win and the love child of the @entity54 will be back in @entity55 by may of 2014 working for some law firm that needs to meet their quota for minority hires , " according to multiple media reports			1
party officials denounced @entity45 's comments			0
@entity64 attorney , @entity63 , who edited @entity51 , said the email and toxic tenor of the race is why his party is struggling to gain traction with women and minorities			2
@entity63 first flagged the email which then became a national story			0
@entity74 , an editor and blogger with @entity76 , put it more bluntly			0
" she was black and needed to know her place , " @entity78 said of the attitude she felt some members of the party establishment displayed toward @entity9			0
" we complain we do n't have enough female and minority candidates			0
then someone with @entity0 's qualifications comes along and we treat them like crap			0
it 's very disheartening to me that the party i belong to does n't get it and is so out of touch			0
you get tired of beating your head against a brick wall			0
" @entity9 , who was once a delegate who spoke at the @entity98 , ultimately lost the primary to @entity13 , 55 % -41 %			2
she now works for an @entity11 law firm			0
" women get discounted from the conversation before they have the opportunity to prove their viability , " @entity9 said of her experience in the primary			2
the @entity6 knows it has a problem recruiting and supporting female candidates and attracting women voters			1
after a self - examination following huge losses among women , minorities and young voters in the 2012 presidential election , the party ramped up its outreach efforts and has spent millions on such initiatives as @entity120 , which seeks to beef up the number of female candidates , and " 14 in 14 " , a program aimed at winning more women voters to the @entity6 cause			1
5 @entity127 races to watch in 2014 party officials point to the success of such candidates as @entity131 , the former mayor of @entity132 , @entity133 , who spoke at the @entity135			0
the @entity6 rising star , who is @entity137 and @entity138 , lost her bid against @entity141 incumbent rep. @entity140 to represent @entity133 's @entity6 - leaning 4th @entity10 by 768 votes in the 2012 general election			2
so , when @entity140 announced he was retiring in 2014 , @entity131 regrouped and strategized with party officials			0
the advice : announce early and run hard			2
" @entity131 is a phenomenal candidate who took advantage of announcing her candidacy early this cycle , " @entity31 said			0
" this time she announced february 2013 which gave her a year and half to fund			0
and now she is almost assured to be a member of @entity36			0
" if she wins the general election this fall , @entity131 would become the first @entity155 @entity6 woman in @entity36			2
" what i 'm seeing , more than anything than in the last presidential election , the @entity6 learned many things and they reached out to women more , " said @entity156 , a @entity6 strategist and radio host			1
" they 've made tremendous strides in reaching out to women candidates and constituents			2
" it 's not enough , said former @entity168 sen. @entity168 of @entity169			0
" the net effect of their efforts is reflected in their results			0
they have fewer women running than they did in 2012			2
they have not made up lost ground and built a strong foundation for women running on the @entity6 ticket , " she said			1
" it 's important to have those efforts , but frankly the overall efforts have n't produced the kinds of results that are essential to build support among women to run for office			1
" " instead of leaning in to encourage more female candidates the party is standing in place , " she said			0
over the past two decades , @entity6 women have been less likely to enter or win primaries when compared to their @entity141 peers , according to a study by @entity199 's @entity198			1
the number of @entity6 women entering primaries has also decreased , the study found			1
part of the problem , some @entity6 women said , is the increasingly polarized nature of congressional districts and the primary battles to represent them			1
women , studies such as the one from @entity199 have found , tend to be more moderate in their views on such issues as reproductive choice and , as a result , struggle in primaries that skew conservative			1
another issue is the increasingly toxic nature of primary showdowns " @entity6 primaries have become bitterly contested , " @entity168 said			1
" what 's to attract anyone to want to engage in that kind of political flummox ? " the very nature of the primary system further complicates matters , @entity9 , @entity168 and other @entity6 women said			1
men dominate @entity127 and @entity231 seats â € ” especially on the @entity6 side			2
therefore , any woman who seeks higher office would either have to wait for that member of @entity36 to retire and leave an open seat or challenge a sitting member of @entity36 in a primary			1
and because state and local parties tend to support sitting members of @entity36 in primaries , @entity6 women are especially challenged when they seek those seats			1
" that 's why i support open primaries so that you get more independents participating in primaries and so it 's not concentrated with the idealogues , " said @entity168 who was considered a @entity231 moderate			1
" the people who vote in the primaries are controlling what happens in an election			0
so just a few people determine who would be governing the state or the country			0
" even when @entity6 women do run for office , the @entity199 study found that they often struggle to net adequate networking and funding support â € ” both within the party and from outside groups â € ” needed to win their races , said @entity267 , director of @entity199 's @entity198			1
while there are a number of well - funded groups , such as @entity273 's list , supporting candidates with more liberal stances , there are fewer groups that do likewise for conservative women , the @entity199 study found			1
former @entity279 governor and 2008 @entity6 vice presidential candidate @entity280 has supported a number of conservative women candidates through her political action committee @entity283			1
her campaigning and fundraising efforts benefited such candidates as @entity288 sen. @entity287 in 2010 and this year @entity289 , a @entity231 candidate from @entity290 who won her primary tuesday night , among others			0
@entity293 , a conservative women 's group , is supporting @entity131 , who won her primary , in her @entity127 bid and @entity297 , an @entity298 doctor who also won her primary and is running for the @entity231 , among other candidates			2
as for @entity9 , she said she would consider another run at public office			2
but she cautions that her tale highlights some of the possible pitfalls			0
" fundraising and party support are imperative if women are going to gain leadership in the @entity6 , " @entity9 said			1
top takeaways from tuesday 's primaries			0

@entity199 study finds @entity6 women struggle to win primaries
former @entity1 and @entity315 faced tough congressional primary
some @entity6 women the blame primary system , a lack of support as problems in @entity6 elections
a more open primary system could help more @entity6 women run , get elected to office
