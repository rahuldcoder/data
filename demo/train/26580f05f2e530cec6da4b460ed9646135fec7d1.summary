@entity0 , @entity1 -- a prominent leader of @entity5 rebels in eastern @entity1 resigned his post thursday as fighting flared there , with militants reportedly downing a @entity1 military plane			1
@entity11 , prime minister of the self - proclaimed @entity12 , told reporters he was stepping down and handing over power to @entity16 , a little - known militia commander			0
as @entity1 forces rapidly advance toward the key rebel - controlled city and @entity21 builds up forces along the border , the sudden resignation leaves a number of questions about the volatile region 's future unanswered : what does it mean ? are militants disbanding and vanishing into the night ? is there a brutal battle ahead ? @entity11 , a @entity21 citizen who rose to power as @entity5 rebels took portions of eastern @entity1 earlier this year , was a prominent public face for the separatists after @entity38 17 crashed last month			1
he gave little reason for his resignation thursday , other than saying he considered the job of founding the republic to be finished and that it was time for a @entity1 to take the reins			1
the announcement came after days of assault on rebel positions near @entity0 by @entity1 forces			1
shelling in the @entity0 area , which could be heard periodically in and around the city , killed four civilians and injured 18 others on thursday , local officials said			1
about 25 miles to the northeast , rebels shot down a @entity1 mig - 29 near the town of @entity58 on thursday evening , @entity1 military spokesman @entity53 said			1
initial information indicates that a missile from a @entity21 - made surface - to - air antiaircraft system , called @entity62 or @entity62 , shot the plane , @entity53 said			2
information about the fate of the pilot was n't immediately available			0
that 's the same type of missile system that @entity70 and @entity1 officials have alleged downed @entity38 17 in eastern @entity1 last month , killing all 298 people on board			1
@entity70 officials have concluded the missile was fired from rebel - held territory			2
rebel leaders and @entity21 , which @entity78 nations have accused of supplying the rebels in the months - long fighting , deny involvement			0
the ongoing fighting has killed close to 1,400 people -- civilians and combatants -- and more than 4,000 people have been wounded in eastern @entity1 since mid-april , according to @entity88 officials			1
the battles also have forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes and seek shelter either elsewhere in @entity1 or across the border in @entity21			1
@entity94 warns @entity21 @entity94 secretary general @entity95 warned @entity21 thursday that any further intervention in @entity1 " would lead to further isolation " and " deeper , more profound , tougher economic sanctions that would really hurt the @entity21 economy			1
" @entity95 told reporters in @entity101 he hopes that @entity21 , which according to @entity94 has 20,000 troops along the border with @entity1 , " steps back because it would n't be in @entity21 's interest to intervene further			2
" @entity21 has denied allegations that it 's supporting separatists in @entity1 and maintains that it wants to see a diplomatic solution to the crisis			2
but @entity70 and @entity1 officials have accused @entity21 of saying one thing while doing another -- building up troops along the border and continuing to send support to @entity5 separatists			2
@entity115 search efforts halted the fighting also prompted an international team of experts , led by the @entity119 , to suspend its efforts to search the @entity115 debris sites for remaining human remains amid fierce fighting in the area			0
the experts said the area was n't safe to search , citing intensified battles in the area			0
@entity119 prime minister @entity127 told reporters wednesday that search teams plan to return to the plane crash site			0
but he did n't give a date for when that might happen			0
" we have done what we could do in the current conditions , " @entity127 said			0
" everyone will agree with us that we should not expose our people to unnecessary risk			0
" @entity1 's government said thursday that it was scrapping a cease - fire around the crash site -- put in place to enable the team 's work -- until their mission restarts			1
in a statement on the @entity147 website , it accused the rebels of provocations and of putting the experts ' lives at risk			0
the statement from @entity1 's @entity147 said at least three more zones where debris lies scattered remain unexamined			2
the experts plan to discuss when the next stage of the search operation might begin shortly , it said			0
until the decision is made , most will leave @entity1 , but coordination and communication teams will stay			2
search for @entity115 victims halted for now what is @entity165 's endgame in @entity1 ? @entity70 , @entity166 coordinate on @entity21 sanctions , but will they work ? things to know about @entity21 and sanctions @entity21 troop increase at @entity1 border raises concerns @entity2 's @entity172 reported from @entity0			1
