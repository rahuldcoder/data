@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 first lady @entity3 and her youngest daughter , @entity5 , 9 , arrived wednesday on @entity1 's southern @entity7 coast for a vacation with friends at a luxury hotel here			1
the @entity12 issued a brief statement tuesday confirming only that " the first lady will travel to @entity1 for a private , mother - daughter trip with longtime family friends			1
president @entity3 will not be joining this trip			1
all activities are closed press			0
" while the @entity1 government also was not providing details , the hotel owners and just about every local politician in the resort of @entity0 , famous for its jet - set image , were discussing the visit that is making front - page news in some @entity1 newspapers			1
" we are really amazed about her choosing our hotel and coming down to the south of @entity1 , paying us such a wonderful visit at the best time of the year , " said @entity29 , co-owner of the @entity30 , where @entity3 and her entourage are staying			1
an aide to mrs. @entity3 and @entity29 confirmed that the first lady was traveling with @entity5			2
the aide said daughter @entity40 , 12 , is away at camp			2
@entity42 was already tight at the hotel on tuesday			0
numerous @entity1 @entity44 patrolled the various access points to the resort , and a large @entity4 flag flapped in the wind alongside a @entity1 flag at the entrance			1
out of sight , @entity29 said , were numerous @entity53 agents			0
her husband , hotel co-owner @entity54 , said @entity3 apparently chose the hotel on the recommendation of friends who had visited before			0
the hotel is in the hills above the resort town of @entity0 , a haunt for the rich and famous , including members of the royal family of @entity64 , @entity1 's so - called jet - set and @entity67 actors such as @entity68 and @entity69			1
@entity71 @entity70 , especially from @entity72 and @entity73 , far outnumber the @entity4 who visit in august , when the beaches are packed			2
the @entity3 group is expected to occupy 60 to 70 rooms , more than a third of the lodging at the 160 - room resort , which consists of hotel rooms , suites and separate villas			1
listed prices start at 300 euros , or nearly $ 400 per night at the resort , which uses @entity86 marble as a decorative theme			0
the facility includes golf courses , tennis courts , a swimming pool and spa and a range of activities for children , such as sports and performing arts			0
@entity5 " will be surrounded by children , and i 'm sure that mrs. @entity3 will be able to do her life and enjoy the spa and the swimming pool , " @entity29 said			0
the @entity12 statement said @entity3 would visit @entity1 's @entity102 and @entity103 , who typically vacation in august at their summer palace on @entity107 in the @entity7 , a short flight from @entity0 on the southern @entity109 ( sun coast ) of @entity1			1
@entity1 media reported the visit with the @entity1 royals could come this weekend			1
before then , many people in old town @entity0 -- with its winding narrow streets and white - washed walls , and in nearby chic @entity116 , where large yachts are moored -- were hoping @entity3 would come for a visit			1
" i suppose [ she ] likes the @entity1 food , " said @entity119 , maitre d ' at the @entity122 restaurant in @entity116			1
" for example , seafood paella			0
and @entity1 fish is very good			2
" at the nearby @entity129 jewelry store , owner @entity127 said , " i think porcelain is very nice			0
i think she likes this style of things			0
and i would make a photo , of course			0
i would be very happy			0
she 's a very nice lady			2
" but on this private vacation under tight security , it 's not likely many local people will get a chance to see @entity3 up close .			2
