-- for consumers , the news that the @entity2 is suing @entity3 and several publishers , accusing them of price - fixing , boils down to one kitchen - table question : will this mean my e-books will get cheaper ? the short answer ? more than likely , yes			1
but the long - term ramifications of the move remain murkier , with some arguing that prices will ultimately rise because of it			0
wednesday 's lawsuit centers around the 2010 release of the @entity18 , when the government alleges @entity3 colluded with six major publishing houses to raise prices on digital books			1
at the time , @entity24 's @entity23 was far and away the dominant device for e-books and @entity24 forced publishers to sell most books on the devices for $ 9.99			1
publishers argued that price was too low and , according to the @entity2 , went to @entity3 in 2009 looking for a way to force @entity24 's hand			1
@entity18 books ultimately sold for closer to $ 12.99 ; as part of their deal with @entity3 , publishers only offered their books to other retailers at the same prices			1
after a couple of days , @entity24 caved and allowed publishers to set their own prices as well			2
" this action drove up e-book prices virtually overnight , " said @entity43 , head of the @entity2 's antitrust division , at a news conference on wednesday			1
" let me be clear : when companies enter agreements that prevent price competition , that is illegal			0
" the three publishers who have already settled with the government -- @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 -- agreed to tear up current contracts and renegotiate pricing with outlets like @entity24 and @entity61 , whose nook is one of the other most popular e-readers			2
so , what happens now ? @entity24 wasted no time suggesting that its prices will be dropping soon			0
" this a big win for @entity23 owners and we look forward to being allowed to lower prices on more @entity23 books , " an @entity24 spokesman said via e-mail			1
that , too , will presumably lead to lower prices			0
and it only stands to reason that @entity3 would have to eventually follow suit			0
@entity3 declined to comment to @entity0 for this story			0
but some say @entity24 's lower prices have been the problem all along			1
@entity83 , a best - selling author and president of the @entity85 , echoes publishing - house complaints			0
calling @entity24 " the @entity92 of the literary world , " @entity83 said in an op - ed piece for @entity88 last month that an @entity3 lawsuit would tilt the field too far in @entity24 's favor			1
" if we reinstate the status quo before @entity3 's ... breakthrough , then bookstores and publishers are going to be the first casualties , " he wrote			2
" right behind them will be readers , who will see the diversity of titles and authors diminish while leading titles get more expensive			0
" the argument goes like this : by selling most new e-books for $ 9.99 , @entity24 is setting a price that 's too low for other competitors to match in a price war			0
if that eventually drives the competition away , @entity24 ( which is already projected to account for more than half of all @entity117 book sales by the end of this year ) would be essentially unchecked and able to set whatever prices it wants			2
the current landscape " looks like a more robust and competitive market , as opposed to the world we will be left with if the @entity2 paves the way for @entity24 to return to its predatory practices , " @entity83 wrote .			0

@entity2 lawsuit against @entity3 will likely lower e-book prices -- at least for now
@entity130 says @entity3 conspired with publishers to drive up book prices
@entity24 , which sold books cheaper for the @entity23 , says its prices will soon drop
some fear settlements will tilt field too far in @entity24 's favor
