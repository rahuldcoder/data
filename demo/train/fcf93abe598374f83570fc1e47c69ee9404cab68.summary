-- exotic animals should live in the wild , not be exploited in profit - motivated zoos -- or worse â € ” as " pets " or backyard oddities by people who have a deeply misguided sense of dominion or ownership			1
what happened in @entity11 on tuesday and wednesday has drawn dramatic attention to the private possession of exotics , an issue that is a major component of @entity17 's mission to protect wildlife			1
on wednesday , 56 exotic animals â € ” including lions , tigers , bears , giraffes and wolves â € ” were freed from their captivity at a rural residence outside @entity27			1
police report the animals ' " owner , " 62 - year - old @entity31 , let the animals out of their cages before he killed himself			2
forty - nine of the animals -- including 18 tigers and 17 lions -- were shot dead by law enforcement officers			1
thankfully , other than @entity31 's death , no human injuries have been reported as a result of this situation			2
@entity11 has had a recent flurry of incidents in which exotic animals being held by private individuals in or outside people 's residences have been involved in violent encounters with humans			1
in september , an 80 - year - old man was attacked by a kangaroo at an exotic - animal farm in @entity53			2
in june , an escaped " pet " grivet monkey scratched two girls while he was on the loose in @entity57			0
in august 2010 , a bear fatally mauled its caretaker on the owner 's property in @entity62			0
born free @entity17 tracks such cases in our @entity65			0
we list 86 incidents involving exotic animals in @entity11 in recent years , and probably many other such encounters have gone unreported			1
nationwide , our database lists nearly 1,600 incidents			0
there is no excuse for wild , potentially dangerous , exotic animals to be kept in private hands			1
@entity11 is one of a handful of states with woefully few regulations on the books to govern such questionable close contact with wildlife , and @entity17 has been pushing for years to get a stronger law enacted in the state			2
in 2006 , the @entity86 quickly introduced a bill to restrict private possession of exotics after an @entity91 woman was mauled by a 500 - pound black bear that escaped a pen kept by a nearby neighbor			0
the bill failed , and just four years later in 2010 , an emergency executive order was put in place after a 24 - year - old man was mauled to death by a black bear kept in a @entity102 compound			0
the order temporarily banned private ownership of big cats , bears , alligators , crocodiles and certain snakes			0
in april 2011 , the order expired upon the promise by the @entity112 and the governor that a new rule - making process would swiftly be established in order to implement regulations regarding possession of exotics			0
this still has not happened			0
what will it take to get swift action in the state -- and in other states around the country that lack complete bans on exotic pet ownership ? will it take a bigger , more diverse animal escape ? a monkeypox outbreak ? people dying ? there is no need to wait , no need to take this kind of dramatic and incomprehensible risk			1
the drain on society from keeping exotic animals as pets is not insignificant			1
humane societies , sheriff 's departments and wildlife sanctuaries end up bearing the brunt of the cost of placing these animals and giving them humane , lifetime care			2
in @entity150 , the @entity149 provides permanent , safe , naturalistic and free - range accommodations for more than 500 macaques , vervets and baboons , many of whom have been rescued from captive lives of stress , deprivation and danger -- danger to both the monkeys and to their " owners			2
" every chance we get , every day we come to work , in as many effective , forceful and creative ways we can , we encourage our members and supporters to spread the word that wild animals belong in the wild			1
what happened in @entity11 this week is appalling			1
all those animals , imprisoned for no good reason			2
their " owner " was apparently a tortured soul who took his own life and put the lives of nearby residents in peril through his bizarre act			0
and all those wandering animals , confused by their sudden and unfathomable " freedom , " were shot dead as though they were alien invaders in a safe bucolic land			0
none of that had to happen			0
it could have been avoided			0
private possession of exotic animals is inexcusable and it puts human lives at risk			1
when will we , as a civilization , learn that wild animals are just as entitled to live freely on this planet as we are and it is our duty and obligation to ensure that this is possible ? maybe , just maybe , the wildlife slaughter on the streets of @entity11 will finally spur the change we need for safer and more compassionate communities across the country			1
he says 18 tigers and 17 lions were among them			1
six animals were taken to the @entity213 .			0

will @entity215 : exotic animals must not be exploited as " pets " or backyard oddities
@entity215 : @entity11 slaughter of *48* wild animals , including 18 tigers and 17 lions , is appalling
@entity11 has a record of violent encounters between animals and people , he says
" owning " exotic animals inexcusable , he says , and also puts human lives at risk
