-- @entity1 is a woman with a mission : to get men into the kitchen			2
@entity5 , a @entity7 woman , was working as a health worker in @entity9 , visiting newly - arrived refugees , when she came across single men going hungry because they had no idea how to prepare simple meals			1
in response , she set up a cookery school for young @entity7 refugee men in @entity17 , @entity9			1
she is the subject of a documentary , " @entity24 , " which was shown in @entity20 on sunday as part of the @entity23 festival			1
in the film , @entity5 talked about a health assessment she did with newly arrived refugees			1
" one day i came across these four boys , " she said			0
" they were just lying on mattresses and i said ' guys , what 's wrong ? ' " they said , ' we 're hungry			2
' there was plenty of food , but they did n't know what to do with it			2
i opened the fridge and there was meat , vegetables , apples , grapes			0
i said ' there 's plenty of food , why are you hungry ? ' " @entity7 refugees began arriving in @entity9 around 2001 , and more than 20,000 came in 10 years , according to the @entity52 government			1
around 2,000 of those settled in @entity17 , @entity9			1
also on @entity54 : film shines light on @entity59 's @entity58 sister " @entity17 was quite a monoculture and then suddenly there was a rush of @entity7 refugees , " said @entity60 , who directed the film about @entity5			1
@entity60 who grew up in @entity65 with a @entity65 father and an @entity52 mother			0
many of the new arrivals were young single men who had lost their parents in @entity72 's civil war and had grown up in refugee camps , such as @entity74 in northern @entity58			1
" these boys are called the ' @entity76 , ' said @entity5 in the film			2
" they do n't know where their parents are , they grew up in refugee camps			1
" they were lost boys in refugee camps , but they could be lost men here in terms of not knowing what to eat or how to cook or anything			1
" read more : @entity72 's ' @entity76 ' reunited with the past deeply entrenched labor divisions in the @entity90 culture of @entity72 made @entity5 's task a tough one			0
not only were the men reluctant to try what they considered to be women 's work , but the women refused to let men in their kitchens and made fun of any who tried			2
@entity5 's own mother @entity100 believed it was taboo for men to cook			1
" she has been telling me what i 'm doing is against the law and if we were in @entity72 i would be charged for it , " @entity5 said in the film			0
@entity5 initially struggled to persuade men to take part in her cookery classes			1
no one turned up to her first class , and only two to her second			0
@entity115 , a youth worker who spent 14 years in refugee camps in @entity117 , said before joining the class : " i 'm quite confused about whether to go or not to go			1
" if you go to a cooking class , you may end up not getting a woman to marry you in the community			0
if you cook you are a woman , you are weak			0
" @entity115 did end up going to the classes , along with around 10 others , aged between 13 and 30			0
@entity60 heard about @entity5 's project after deciding he wanted to make a documentary about @entity7 refugees in @entity17			2
" i liked the idea of making a film that was n't a sob story about hardship			1
it was a great opportunity to make something that was more uplifting , " said @entity60 , 33			0
he said he had come across men 's reluctance to cook in his own upbringing , but was surprised by how deeply held the views in the @entity90 community were			2
" after hearing @entity1 's story about finding a lot of men who were struggling to feed themselves , i thought there would be a lot of enthusiasm for the cooking school , " he said			1
also on @entity54 : artist joins @entity148 's ' cultural explosion ' after around three months of classes , @entity5 persuaded the men to hold a feast for the women in the community to prove their worth in the kitchen			0
@entity60 said : " by the end , they were n't going to be on @entity158 , but they gained a bit more confidence and were a bit more open to trying			0
" " @entity24 , " released last year , was @entity60 's first film and throughout the making he continued working in two jobs , as a laborer and a barman			0
he has since made a film called " @entity169 in @entity170 , " about an @entity52 brother and sister traveling to @entity170			0
