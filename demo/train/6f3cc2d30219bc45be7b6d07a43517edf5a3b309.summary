@entity0 , @entity1 -- a light - weight gun named after an @entity1 gang rape victim has triggered a wave of criticism from advocates who call it " abhorrent			1
" last week , an @entity1 state - run gunmaker introduced the .32 - calibre revolver , made of titanium alloy , calling it a " valuable contribution to women 's security			1
" the 500 - gram firearm is called @entity16 , meaning fearless in @entity17			2
the name was " inspired by @entity20 , " said @entity18 , the general manager of the @entity19			1
@entity20 is the name given by the @entity1 media to the 23 - year - old woman who was raped and beaten by several men aboard a public bus on december 16 , 2012			1
the brutal attack provoked outrage across @entity1 and led to calls for improved safety and treatment of women			1
@entity18 said the project was conceived more than two years ago -- before the bus rape happened			2
" it can serve as a deterrence , " @entity18 said			0
" there 's something you can do to prevent these attacks			0
you can also enthuse confidence among women			2
" the lightness of the revolver makes it more suitable for women , he said , adding that he expected male buyers as well			2
since its introduction last week , the factory has sold just 10 of the @entity16 weapons			0
wrong message @entity53 , founder of the @entity54 of @entity1 , described the new gun as " an insult			1
" " women in @entity1 feel this gun is not going to help in security , " she said			1
" and we do not believe the gun is a solution to ending sexual violence			0
" she added that it sent the wrong message			0
rather than prioritizing security for women , " the government is introducing expensive weaponry to sit in handbags			0
it 's an abhorrence to women , " she said			0
the gun costs 122,000 rupees , ( around $ 2,000 ) , putting it above @entity1 's average annual per capita income , which is around $ 1,410			1
when asked what kind of the clientele @entity18 was looking for the new handgun , he conceded it was likely unaffordable for those outside middle and upper income groups			0
" it 's not for poor women , " he said			0
owning guns @entity1 also has strict controls on gun ownership , with licenses difficult to obtain			1
" @entity87 licenses are given rarely -- only to those with money and clout , and that means overwhelmingly men			2
poor women in @entity1 are unlikely to have the means or the access to own a gun , " said @entity93 , a women 's rights activist who is founder of @entity94			1
aside from the guns being out of reach for poor women , @entity93 agreed it projected the wrong message			0
" @entity20 was a victim of violence caused by a desire of six men to project their masculinity through domination			1
ultimately we have to challenge the culture of domination and violence through nonviolence not through introducing more tools of violence , " she said			0
so far , the gun factory in the northern @entity1 city of @entity117 has received 50 to 60 inquiries about the product , @entity18 said			1
he did n't have a breakdown of how many of the gun 's potential buyers were women			2
