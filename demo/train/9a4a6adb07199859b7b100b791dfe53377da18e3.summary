@entity0 -- the detectives who built the murder case against @entity4 said tuesday they stand behind their evidence but urge the public to respect the jury 's verdict of acquittal			1
" in any case -- especially a case with this many witnesses and this much evidence -- you can always look back and improve on what you have done , " @entity11 sgt. @entity10 told reporters			1
" i do n't know if anybody up here can think of anything we could have done differently that would change the outcome			0
" @entity24 was acquitted last week of killing her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity4 , but convicted of four misdemeanor counts of lying to investigators			1
the verdict provoked outrage among many who watched the intensely publicized case closely in the three years since @entity4 's disappearance			1
" i wish there was something i could say that would bring closure to everyone , but there is n't , " cpl. @entity33 told reporters			2
" i just know that , unfortunately , people are going to have to come to their own sense of closure within themselves and understand that as far as this case is concerned , as far as the judicial system is concerned , there 's nothing else we can do			2
" @entity24 , 25 , was given the maximum sentence on each of the misdemeanor counts -- a total of four years			1
but with credit for the time she has spent jailed since her 2008 arrest , she is slated to be released sunday			2
" i think all of us respect the jury system , and we respect the jury 's verdict , " @entity10 said			0
" i would hope that people who followed us , people in the community , would also respect the jury 's verdict and our process			0
" but for us , i certainly do n't have any doubt after working on this , " he said			0
" i felt our case was solid			1
" @entity71 sheriff @entity70 said that despite the " plethora of chatter " surrounding the controversial verdict , investigators have not received any " credible threats " to @entity24 and wo n't offer any special protection to her upon release			1
in a case built on circumstantial evidence , prosecutors accused @entity24 of using chloroform to render her daughter unconscious , then duct - taping her mouth and nose to suffocate her			1
they alleged that she put the child 's body in the trunk of her car for a few days before disposing of it			0
her lawyers argued that @entity4 accidentally drowned in the @entity96 's above - ground pool , and that @entity4 and her father , @entity24 , panicked and covered up the death -- something @entity24 denied on the witness stand			1
the case began drew national attention in part because @entity24 failed to report @entity4 missing for a month , during which she moved out of her parent 's home , partied in @entity0 nightclubs and shopped			1
when confronted , she accused a nonexistent nanny of taking the girl			0
@entity4 's skeletal remains were n't found until december 2008 , six months after she was last seen alive			2
if her body had been discovered earlier , " i would like to say that maybe more evidence would have been found , " @entity10 said			0
" but it 's impossible to say			0
" @entity24 's scattershot defense included challenges to forensic evidence ; allegations that she had been molested by her father ; an attempt to cast suspicion on the meter reader who discovered the girl 's body ; and an unsuccessful attempt to call her own competency to stand trial into question			2
ultimately , however , lead attorney @entity129 argued that the prosecution 's case failed to show how the girl died , and left jurors with " more questions than you have answers			0
" @entity10 said detectives had no evidence beyond " @entity140 's word " that her father had sexually abused her -- an allegation @entity24 also denied in his sometimes - emotional testimony			2
and @entity33 said @entity4 never said anything about an accident when she was questioned by police about her daughter 's disappearance			1
" that would have been her opportunity to say so , had it been , " @entity33 said			0
he added , " even to this day , i 'm still surprised that she just did n't come off it , she would n't tell us the truth			0
" " that 's all we were after , was the truth -- that day , this whole thing could have ended had we known the truth			0

new : no " credible threats " to @entity24 despite anger , sheriff says
" i felt our case was solid , " detective tells reporters
@entity4 was acquitted of killing her daughter last week
she is *scheduled* to be released from jail sunday
