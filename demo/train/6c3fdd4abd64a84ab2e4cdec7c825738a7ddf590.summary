-- in a new policy statement published in the april 2011 issue of @entity4 , the @entity1 now advises parents to keep toddlers in rear - facing car seats until age 2 , or until they exceed the height or weight limit for the car seat , which can be found on the back of the seat			1
previously , the @entity1 advised parents to keep kids rear - facing as long as possible , up to the maximum limit of the car seat , and this has not changed			1
but it also cited one year and 20 pounds as the minimum for flipping the seat , which many parents and pediatricians interpreted as conventional wisdom on the best time to make the switch			0
the new policy clarifies the aap 's recommendation , making age 2 the new guideline -- a real game - changer for parents of toddlers			2
a 2007 study in the journal @entity33 found that children under age 2 are 75 percent less likely to die or to be severely injured in a crash if they are rear - facing			1
another study found riding rear - facing to be five times safer than forward - facing			1
" a rear - facing child safety seat does a better job of supporting the head , neck and spine of infants and toddlers in a crash , because it distributes the force of the collision over the entire body , " said @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity1 , a pediatric emergency physician and co-scientific director of the @entity44 at @entity45 and lead author of the policy statement and accompanying technical report			1
recall finder : check if your child 's car seat has been recalled parenting talked to @entity66 , @entity41 , associate professor of pediatrics at the @entity68 in @entity69 and a child passenger safety technician , to get answers to parents ' most pressing questions about the new policy			0
although the new baseline is now age 2 , the @entity1 has advised parents since 2002 to keep kids rear - facing until they reach the height or weight limit of their car seat			1
why are parents so eager to turn their car seats ? " parents are interested in milestones , and the minimum of one year and 20 pounds has been interpreted as gold standard instead of the minimum , " says @entity66			2
" parents are always looking for the next stage of development because in every other scenario , that 's a good thing			0
with car safety seats , however , that 's often not the case			2
" but is n't forward - facing easier for everyone ? yes , it 's easier to interact with your child when she is facing forward , and less awkward to get her into the seat			2
but safety should be the main concern			0
" i would ask parents to consider the protection of the child in addition to comfort , " says @entity66			0
" it 's minimally acceptable to change to forward - facing at a year , but parents can do better than that			2
" new infant and convertible car seats to keep your child safe what about squished legs ? kids who have been only rear - faced will most likely not be bothered , since they do n't know anything else			1
and it 's completely fine for their feet to touch the seat back , or for their legs to bend			0
" once you make the switch , it 's hard to go back , so try not to ever switch them before they are ready , " says @entity66			0
why are so few parents aware of even the older guidelines that say kids should stay rear - facing as long as possible ? there may have been some confusion with the message , with many parents mistaking the minimum for the ideal age to make the switch			1
the @entity1 hopes that by making age 2 the new guideline , the message will be less confusing for parents and for pediatricians			2
if my child turns 2 before he reaches the height or weight limit for the seat , should i keep him rear - facing ? yes			1
the safest decision is to keep him rear - facing until he reaches the height or weight limit for the seat			1
10 @entity150 mistakes you may be making if my child reaches the height or weight limit for my seat before age 2 , what should i do ? once your child exceeds the height and weight limit of his infant car seat , purchase a convertible car seat with a higher height or weight limit ( most go to 35 pounds rear - facing ) and continue to use it rear - facing until age two , or until your child hits the height or weight limit for rear - facing use			1
at that point you can make the switch to forward - facing -- or you can purchase a convertible car seat with a higher weight limit for rear - facing ( some go up to 45 pounds )			1
" that 's a very personal decision for the parent , " says @entity66 , one that may also be influenced by the size of your car , the arrival of a younger sibling , or your budget			0
what should i do if i 've already switched my under - 2 child for forward - facing ? the best advice is for parents to consider switching their child back to rear - facing			1
but the next best thing is to , at a minimum , make sure you correctly use the seat you have : make sure the seat is harnessed tightly to the vehicle , that the harness is snug over the child and the chest clip is in the correct position , and that the seatbelt or latch system are installed correctly			0
why did n't my pediatrician tell me about this ? " @entity200 should be talking about this , " says @entity66			0
" but given everything else that needs to happen in a well - child visit , sometimes this message gets left behind			0
i would love to see a day where every family - care health provider knew the best possible advice and shared it with their patients			0
