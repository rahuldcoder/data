-- @entity1 signed a bill monday to regulate the use of electronic cigarettes -- one of 22 bills he signed at @entity7 that are the last he will sign as mayor of @entity9 , according to @entity10 , his deputy press secretary			1
the legislation amends the @entity12 , which bans smoking in public places such as restaurants , bars , parks , beaches and places of employment			1
it now additionally prohibits the use of electronic cigarettes in all areas where smoking is prohibited			1
e-cigarettes will still be permitted in areas where smoking is allowed , in addition to retail e-cigarette stores and vapor lounges			1
e-cigarettes are " battery - operated products that turn nicotine , which is highly addictive , and / or chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user , " according to @entity37 spokesperson @entity36			1
unlike a regular cigarette , there 's no tobacco burned and when users inhale , instead of smoke , there 's a steam - like vapor			2
some e-cigarette devices claim to help people kick their smoking habit , but @entity1 said he 's not convinced and it 's just another way to inhale nicotine			1
" it works about as well as patches , which is to say it really does n't work , " he said			0
a pro-smoking activist read a brief statement lobbying against the bill , saying smoking is within a person 's legal private life and not public health			1
" you do n't own me like state property , " the lobbyist said to @entity62 as she took out a cigarette from her pocket and lit up			2
the woman was escorted out of the meeting immediately afterward			2
@entity69 told @entity0 's @entity70 he smoked cigarettes for 10 years			2
while he 's still addicted to nicotine , he has n't smoked a cigarette for two and a half years			2
he credits kicking the bad habit to e-cigarettes			0
@entity69 said he worries many @entity76 are so opposed to smoking that they 're stigmatizing something some say could save lives			0
@entity79 , director of cancer science and trends at the @entity81 , said that e-cigarette users should smoke with " cautious optimism			0
" " anyone who uses an e-cigarette right now does not know what they 're inhaling , " @entity79 said			0
" what we do n't want to do is to take something out of the hands of people which could in fact help people stop using the traditional burn cigarette , which is the enemy			0
" there are no e-cigarette devices regulated by any federal body , and e-cigarettes are not an @entity37 - approved method to quit smoking			1
a 2010 court decision , which the @entity37 agreed to abide by , held that if e-cigarette companies stopped making therapeutic claims , their products would not be regulated by the @entity37 , according to @entity36			0
right now , the @entity37 's @entity109 -- established in 2009 by the @entity110 -- has the authority to only regulate certain categories of " tobacco products , " which exclusively applies to cigarettes , cigarette tobacco , roll - your - own tobacco and smokeless tobacco , according to @entity36			0
the @entity37 intends to propose a rule deeming any product that meets the definition of a " tobacco product " under the act to be subject to @entity37 's regulatory authority			0
the @entity37 also intends to propose a regulation that would extend the agency 's " tobacco product " authorities to other categories of tobacco products that meet the statutory definition of " tobacco product , " @entity36 told @entity0			0
" further research is needed to assess the potential public health benefits and risk of electronic cigarettes and other novel tobacco products , " @entity36 said			0
the @entity37 declined to comment on the newly signed bill in @entity9			1
@entity62 signed another controversial bill at the final meeting of the legislative session , which requires the @entity143 commissioner to determine the recyclability of expanded polystyrene foam , leading to the potential ban of the material from food services establishments , mobile food commissaries and retail stores beginning july 1 , 2015			1
" all of the environmental stuff , the payoff is n't for years , but it 's what makes the city habitable and keeps us safe , " @entity1 said			1
@entity70 and @entity156 contributed to this report			0
