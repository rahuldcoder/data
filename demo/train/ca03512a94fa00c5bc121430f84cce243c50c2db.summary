@entity0 , the visionary in the black turtleneck who co-founded @entity3 in a @entity5 garage , built it into the world 's leading tech company and led a mobile - computing revolution with wildly popular devices such as the @entity11 , died wednesday			1
the hard - driving executive pioneered the concept of the personal computer and of navigating them by clicking onscreen images with a mouse			1
in more recent years , he introduced the @entity19 portable music player , the @entity11 and the @entity21 tablet -- all of which changed how we consume content in the digital age			1
@entity27 : ten ways @entity0 changed the world his friends and @entity3 fans on wednesday night mourned the passing of a tech titan			1
" @entity0 's brilliance , passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives , " @entity3 said in a statement			1
" the world is immeasurably better because of @entity0			2
" see reactions from @entity44 , @entity45 and many others more than one pundit , praising @entity0 ' ability to transform entire industries with his inventions , called him a modern - day @entity51			2
" @entity0 is one of the great innovators in the history of modern capitalism , " @entity54 columnist @entity53 said in august			2
" his intuition has been phenomenal over the years			0
" @entity0 ' death , while dreaded by @entity3 's legions of fans , was not unexpected			1
he had battled cancer for years , took a medical leave from @entity3 in january and stepped down as chief executive in august because he could " no longer meet ( his ) duties and expectations			1
" born february 24 , 1955 , and then adopted , @entity0 grew up in @entity68 , @entity69 -- which would become home to @entity3 's headquarters -- and showed an early interest in electronics			1
as a teenager , he phoned @entity76 , president of @entity77 , to request parts for a school project			0
he got them , along with an offer of a summer job at @entity77 @entity0 dropped out of @entity84 's @entity83 after one semester , although he returned to audit a class in calligraphy , which he says influenced @entity3 's graceful , minimalist aesthetic			1
he quit one of his first jobs , designing video games for @entity91 , to backpack across @entity92 and take psychedelic drugs			0
those experiences , @entity0 said later , shaped his creative vision			2
" you ca n't connect the dots looking forward ; you can only connect them looking backwards			0
so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future , " he told @entity100 graduates during a commencement speech in 2005			0
" you have to trust in something : your gut , destiny , life , karma , whatever			0
this approach has never let me down , and it has made all the difference in my life			0
" view a time line of @entity0 ' work while at @entity77 , @entity0 befriended @entity114 , who impressed him with his skill at assembling electronic components			2
the two later joined a @entity5 computer hobbyists club , and when he was 21 , @entity0 teamed with @entity114 and two other men to launch @entity119 it 's long been @entity5 legend : @entity0 and @entity114 built their first commercial product , the @entity3 1 , in @entity0 ' parents ' garage in 1976			1
@entity0 sold his @entity127 van to help finance the venture			2
the primitive computer , priced at $ 666.66 , had no keyboard or display , and customers had to assemble it themselves			0
the following year , @entity3 unveiled the @entity3 computer at the inaugural @entity135			1
the machine was a hit , and the personal computing revolution was under way			0
@entity0 was among the first computer engineers to recognize the appeal of the mouse and the graphical interface , which let users operate computers by clicking on images instead of writing text			1
@entity3 's pioneering @entity149 computer launched in early 1984 with a now - iconic , orwellian - themed @entity151 ad			1
the boxy beige @entity149 sold well , but the demanding @entity0 clashed frequently with colleagues , and in 1986 , he was ousted from @entity3 after a power struggle			1
then came a 10 - year hiatus during which he founded @entity156 , whose pricey , cube - shaped computer workstations never caught on with consumers			2
@entity0 had more success when he bought @entity160 from @entity161 before the company made it big with " @entity164			2
" @entity0 brought the same marketing skill to @entity160 that he became known for at @entity3			1
his brief but emotional pitch for " @entity168 , " for example , was a masterful bit of succinct storytelling			0
share your memories and images of @entity0 in 1996 , @entity3 bought @entity156 , returning @entity0 to the then - struggling company he had co-founded			1
within a year , he was running @entity3 again -- older and perhaps wiser but no less of a perfectionist			2
and in 2001 , he took the stage to introduce the original @entity19 , the little white device that transformed portable music and kick - started @entity3 's furious comeback			1
thus began one of the most remarkable second acts in the history of business			0
over the next decade , @entity0 wowed launch - event audiences , and consumers , with one game - changing hit after another : @entity187 ( 2003 ) , the @entity11 ( 2007 ) , the @entity188 ( 2008 ) , and the @entity21 ( 2010 )			1
@entity190 ' top moments as a showman observers marveled at @entity0 ' skills as a pitchman , his ability to inspire godlike devotion among @entity3 " fanboys " ( and scorn from @entity200 fans ) and his " one more thing " surprise announcements			1
time after time , he sold people on a product they did n't know they needed until he invented it			0
and all this on an official annual salary of $ 1			0
he also built a reputation as a hard - driving , mercurial and sometimes difficult boss who oversaw almost every detail of @entity3 's products and rejected prototypes that did n't meet his exacting standards			1
by the late 2000s , his once - renegade tech company , the @entity215 to @entity217 's @entity216 , was entrenched at the uppermost tier of @entity220 business			0
@entity3 now operates more than 300 retail stores in 11 countries			2
the company has sold more than 275 million ipods , 100 million iphones and 25 million @entity21 worldwide			2
@entity0 ' climb to the top was complete in summer 2011 , when @entity3 listed more cash reserves than the @entity229 and even briefly surpassed @entity230 as the world 's most valuable company			1
@entity233 : @entity3 stock under @entity0 but @entity0 ' health problems sometimes cast a shadow over his company 's success			1
in 2004 , he announced to his employees that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer			0
he lost weight and appeared unusually gaunt at keynote speeches to @entity3 developers , spurring concerns about his health and fluctuations in the company 's stock price			2
one wire service accidentally published @entity0 ' obituary			0
@entity0 had a secret liver transplant in 2009 in @entity252 during a six - month medical leave of absence from @entity3			1
he took another medical leave in january this year			0
perhaps mindful of his legacy , he cooperated on his first authorized biography , scheduled to be published by @entity258 in november			0
@entity0 is survived by his wife of 20 years , @entity260 , and four children , including one from a prior relationship			1
he always spoke with immense pride about what he and his engineers accomplished at @entity3			0
" your work is going to fill a large part of your life , and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work			0
and the only way to do great work is to love what you do , " he told the @entity100 grads in 2005			0
" if you have n't found it yet , keep looking			0
as with all matters of the heart , you 'll know when you find it			0
and , like any great relationship , it just gets better and better as the years roll on			0
