@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 has put off crucial " integrity tests " on the new stacking cap on its ruptured @entity6 oil well so it can review testing procedures , a review expected to take place through the night and into wednesday			1
the oil giant had expected the tests -- to check pressure in the well and determine if it can be sealed once and for all -- to get under way tuesday afternoon			1
but late tuesday night , @entity3 announced that additional analysis of the well testing procedure was needed			1
the move following a meeting with energy secretary @entity20 and his team of advisers			1
a source informed about @entity3 operations told @entity2 's @entity25 that , " there were some potential complications that might cause a delay -- some bad , some in the better to be safe than sorry category			1
" it had been hoped that the integrity tests would show whether an end is in sight to the environmental disaster that has been unfolding for the last 12 weeks			1
but throughout the evening , cameras some 5,000 feet below the surface showed oil gushing from the well 's capping stack , indicating that valves had not been closed to begin the pressure tests			2
the massive custom - designed cap , which has a better seal than the last cap placed on the well , is some 30 feet high and weighs 160,000 pounds			2
it 's hoped that it might seal the well completely			0
but if it 's unable to contain all the oil , some could be diverted through riser pipes to ships on the surface			0
under a worst - case scenario , however , tests might show there 's more damage to the well 's casing , meaning that capping the well would not stop the oil from flowing			2
retired adm. @entity61 , who is leading the federal response to the oil disaster , says the well cap placement is part a " very complex , nuanced and broad - based response " to the rupture of the underwater well in april , an accident that killed 11 oil workers and caused worst environmental disaster in @entity73 history			1
when they do take place , the integrity tests will measure pressure inside the well and will last anywhere from six to 48 hours			1
they will involve incrementally closing three valves on the new cap , a process that would allow @entity3 to do its pressure measurements			1
higher pressure readings would mean the leak is being stopped , while lower pressure indications would mean oil is escaping from other parts of the well			0
" in this exercise , high pressure is good , " @entity61 said			1
" we are looking for somewhere between eight and nine thousand psi ( pounds per square inch ) inside the capping stack , which would indicate to us that the hydrocarbons are being forced up and the well bore 's being able to withstand that pressure			0
" @entity61 was asked what he thought the odds were to the success of being able to shut the well with the new cap			1
" i think we are very confident we can take control of this hydrocarbon stream and then slowly close all these valves and stop the emission of hydrocarbons			0
what we ca n't tell is the current condition of the well bore below the sea floor and the implication of the pressure readings , " he said			1
" that is in fact why we 're doing a well integrity test			2
" the latest containment cap , while seeming to offer the best odds of success , was n't ready earlier			1
in addition , @entity3 has learned from previous , unsuccessful containment efforts , @entity2 's @entity122 reported on " @entity123			1
" @entity61 said that if low pressure readings persist for around a six - hour time frame , that could signal problems with the new cap if it 's determined that the cap ca n't seal the well completely , and some crude must be sent to the surface , the oil - gathering ship , the @entity134 , in now in place			1
on monday it joined the @entity137 , which was already active			0
and more vessels are planned			0
@entity61 said a four - vessel system that could recover 80,000 barrels a day could be ready by the end of the month			2
meanwhile , in another development tuesday , the @entity142 administration sent @entity3 and other responsible parties a fourth bill relating to the oil spill			2
the new bill is for $ 99.7 million			0
it comes on top of a total of $ 122.3 million in the first three bills			0
the government says the parties are responsible for all costs associated with the spill , including stopping the leak , protecting the shoreline and long - term recovery efforts			0
the money will help replenish a $ 1.5 billion federal trust fund established to pay for damages associated with oil spills			0
among those costs is skimming oil on the surface of the @entity6			0
@entity61 said authorities are on pace to have around 1,000 skimmers available by the end of the month			2
at this point , there are fewer than 600			0
work also has been continuing on the ultimate solution to fixing the problem , drilling two relief wells			0
but @entity3 does n't expect the first relief well work to be completed until august			1
scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil have spewed daily from @entity3 's breached well and @entity61 cautions that even if the engineering containment efforts work , there is still a lot to be done in a disaster that has affected the environment and the livelihoods of people from @entity1 to @entity186			1
" there 's still a significant amount of oil out there , and the oil recovery and the impacts of this oil will probably extend well into the fall in terms of oil coming ashore , tar balls , beach cleanup , and then we will be moving of course at that point of the natural resources damage assessment trying to understand the long - term environmental ecological impact of the event , " @entity61 said			2
and the presidential commission tasked with investigating the @entity6 oil gusher and making recommendations about the future of offshore drilling continued its public meetings tuesday			0
the @entity211 has six months to determine what happened when the @entity214 oil rig exploded april 20 -- and how to prevent something similar from ever happening again			0
a new moratorium on deepwater drilling issued by the @entity73 @entity218 monday has already played a prominent role in the hearings			0
@entity2 's @entity221 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity3 puts off crucial " integrity " tests to check *effectiveness* of new containment cap
new : testing procedures are being reviewed , a process expected to go through the night
new : move follows meeting with @entity233
@entity61 ca n't put odds on success of the new cap
