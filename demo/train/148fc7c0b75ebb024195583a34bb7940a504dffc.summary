-- @entity2 cricket captain @entity1 has delivered an emotional tribute to friend and fellow cricketer @entity5 at his funeral , telling mourners he felt his spirit with him			1
breaking down at times , @entity1 spoke of visiting the pitch at the @entity11 where @entity5 fatally injured when hit by a " bouncer " -- a short - pitched , aggressive delivery that bounces up towards the batsman 's torso -- while batting for the @entity17 side against @entity18			1
" i walked in the middle of the @entity11 on thursday night , those same blades of grass beneath my feet where he and i and so many of his mates here today had built partnerships , taken chances , and lived out the dreams we painted in our heads as boys , " said @entity1			1
" the same stands where the crowds rose to their feet to cheer him on , and that same fence he sent the ball to time and time again , and it 's now forever the place where he fell			2
" he continued : " i stood there at the wicket , i kneeled down and touched the grass			0
i swear he was with me , picking me up off my feet to check if i was okay , telling me we just needed to dig in and get through to tea			0
" in a tribute referencing the " spirit of cricket " and the outpouring of grief from the sport 's fans around the world in the wake of @entity5 ' death , he said his friend had " left a mark on our game that needs no embellishment			1
" " i do n't know about you , but i keep looking for him			0
i know it 's crazy , but i expect any minute to take a call from him , or to see his face pop around the corner , " said @entity1 , who also acted as a pallbearer			2
" is this what we call the spirit ? if so , then his spirit is still with me , and i hope it never leaves			2
" @entity5 ' funeral service took place wednesday in a packed school hall in his home town of @entity77 , @entity18 -- a small town on @entity17 's eastern coast , where he was raised on a banana and beef farm			1

" he recalled how his cousin was introduced to cricket through backyard cricket games with his brother and neighbors in the country			0
" there was no quarter either asked or given in those backyard test matches , " said @entity88			0
although initially reluctant to take part , @entity5 took to the sport with a passion , and never looked back			2
opinion : the unspoken ' if only ' in @entity5 ' death the left - handed batsman represented @entity17 in @entity111 , the highest standard of the game , after making his debut in 2009 at the age of 20			1
@entity2 cricket writer @entity116 told @entity0 that although @entity5 , who was named @entity17 's domestic cricket player of the year in 2013 , had been dropped from the national side on occasion , " no one seemed to doubt that he was a character that we would be watching for the next 10 - 15 years			1
" " no one had a greater appetite for the game , " said @entity116			0
" he had that drive , he had that enthusiasm			0
" @entity5 ' cousin @entity88 spoke of his response to those setbacks in his career			2
" i never , ever once heard him complain about being dropped from the @entity2 team , " he told mourners			2
" he believed he would come back bigger and better , and continuing to pile on runs			0
" @entity5 ' friend , @entity134 , recalled the cricketer 's love of @entity138 cattle -- and a deal he made with himself to add to his herd every time he scored a century , an innings of 100 runs or more			1
" his herd grew very quickly , " said @entity134			0
a host of past and present @entity2 and other international cricketers attended the funeral -- as did @entity2 prime minister @entity147			1
