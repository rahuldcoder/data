-- the longstanding conflict between @entity2 and the @entity4 group @entity3 reignited last week after @entity2 launched airstrikes against what it called terrorist targets in @entity8			1
@entity2 explained that the offensive , which it calls " @entity10 , " was necessitated by increasing rocket attacks from the @entity3 - controlled territory			1
are you there ? share photos , video but stay safe			0
among those killed in the @entity2 airstrikes wednesday was @entity19 , the chief of @entity3 ' military wing			1
weapons depots and rocket - launching sites were also targeted			0
" @entity3 and the other terrorist organizations in @entity8 have made normal life impossible for over 1 million @entity2 , " @entity2 prime minister @entity23 said in a statement			1
" no government would tolerate a situation where nearly a fifth of its people live under a constant barrage of rockets and missile fire			2
" @entity4 leaders condemned the attacks and said it is just another example of @entity2 's aggression toward @entity8			1
since @entity3 took control of @entity8 in 2007 , @entity2 has imposed a crippling economic embargo on the territory because it views @entity3 as a terrorist organization bent on destroying the state of @entity2			1
faq : what is @entity3 , and what are its aims ? meanwhile , @entity3 ' military wing vowed revenge , warning that @entity2 had opened " the gates of hell on themselves			1
" since then , @entity2 and @entity3 have been trading bombs and rockets , and there is international concern that the situation could escalate into an even bloodier ground war			1
the @entity2 government has called up 75,000 reservists and massed 30,000 troops across the border of the @entity4 territory , according to the @entity61			2
" if this situation continues and it escalates , it 's going to be really serious and tragic -- not just for @entity2 and @entity4 , but actually it will cause a huge amount of upheaval right across the region , " said former @entity63 prime minister @entity62 , who is envoy for the @entity64 working to find a peace agreement			1
" and this is a region , as you know , that does n't require more upheaval right now			0
" @entity76 @entity75 ban ki - moon flew to the region monday to personally appeal for a cease - fire , joining a chorus of @entity81 and @entity82 leaders who do not want to see a repeat of 2009 , when a three - week ground offensive resulted in the deaths of at least 1,400 palestinians and 13 @entity2			2
but not all of those leaders view the conflict similarly			0
many of the @entity81 nations , including the @entity92 and several @entity94 countries , see @entity3 as the aggressor			0
@entity92 president @entity97 , speaking in @entity96 on sunday , said @entity3 rocket attacks were the " precipitating " event for the fighting and that " we are actively working with all the parties in the region to see if we can end those missiles being fired without further escalation of violence			1
" the @entity92 , like @entity2 , views @entity3 as a terrorist organization			2
more : @entity97 's telephone diplomacy on @entity8 many @entity82 and @entity109 nations , on the other hand , see @entity3 as the victim of @entity2 aggression			1
@entity114 , for example , recalled its ambassador to @entity2 and delivered a formal protest to the @entity2 government			0
" no one can remain still and watch this tragedy unfold in this fashion , " @entity114 prime minister @entity118 said friday			0
the whole world must intervene , and @entity2 must abide by the agreements and stop the aggression			2
" @entity118 visited a @entity8 hospital and kissed the lifeless body of a 4 - year - old boy said to have been killed by an @entity2 airstrike			2
the @entity2 military told @entity0 , however , that it did not carry out any strikes at the time of the child 's death ; it said it had stopped temporarily for @entity118 's visit			1
the death of civilians , especially children , has been a common rallying cry for critics of @entity2 's offensive			0
ten people , including several children , were pulled from the rubble after one airstrike in @entity8 , as @entity0 's @entity145 witnessed			0
@entity2 authorities said they go to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties in densely populated @entity8 , even dropping leaflets and nonlethal bombs to warn people about bombings in advance			1
but " the terrorists , " @entity23 said , " are committing a double war crime : they fire at @entity2 civilians , and they hide behind @entity4 civilians			2
" and sometimes , according to a tweet from the @entity2 military , " @entity3 fires from civilian areas and hits its own people			1
" both @entity2 and @entity3 have taken to @entity161 to defend their cause and sway outside opinion			2
one recent graphic , tweeted from the account of @entity3 ' military wing , said @entity2 is n't killing terrorists in @entity8 ; it 's killing children , senior citizens and women			1
the @entity2 military tweeted a graphic that asked , " what would you do if rockets were striking your country ? @entity176 if you agree that # @entity2 has the right to self - defense			1
" as the fighting and the finger - pointing carry on , there 's no denying that suffering continues on both sides			0
@entity0 's @entity183 interviewed one woman in @entity8 who lost her two children , ages 2 and 4			0
" i am in shock , i ca n't believe it , " @entity187 said , crying			0
" my two children , they are priceless to me			0
my life is now very difficult			0
" in @entity197 , a town in southern @entity2 , everyone is constantly afraid of rocket attacks , its mayor said			1
" we ca n't go on like this , " mayor @entity199 told @entity0 's @entity200			0
" we have 131,000 people here and 26,000 children			0
they are constantly under threat			0
" many experts expect that both @entity2 and @entity3 will find it in their best interests to eventually stop fighting			1
neither side has much to gain in repeating the events of 2009 , writes @entity211 , a vice president and distinguished scholar at the @entity213			0
@entity211 , who served as a @entity64 negotiator in @entity216 and @entity217 organizations , said : " @entity218 did n't fix the problem then , and it 's unlikely to fix it now			0
nor do the @entity2 -- when the real threat is @entity223 -- want to get into a major military and political mess over @entity8 that would make their relationship with @entity114 even more complicated			1
" more : why @entity2 might hesitate to invade but if war is n't the answer , why do the bombs and rockets continue to fly ? @entity231 , a professor of political science and international affairs at @entity234 , said each side suspects the other of playing domestic politics			2
" palestinians fear that the @entity2 government is making war with an eye to upcoming elections			2
@entity2 suspect that @entity3 -- whose full name is the " @entity3 " -- is lobbing rockets because it is tired of its rivals ' taunting that it is not living up to its middle name , " said @entity231 , who has authored six books on @entity64 politics			2
there is some truth to these charges , @entity231 said , but both sides have other goals in mind			0
" the @entity2 know that they can not dislodge @entity3 from @entity8 without unacceptable cost and endless occupation			1
but they want to punish the movement so severely that it will be deterred from future violence , " he said			0
" @entity3 knows that the damage it inflicts serves no strategic value , but it hopes that its rockets will cause dislocation and even panic in @entity2 and send an international message that @entity8 can not be ignored			1
" how @entity64 has changed since last @entity8 conflict @entity0 's @entity183 , @entity145 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 and @entity276 contributed to this report .			0
