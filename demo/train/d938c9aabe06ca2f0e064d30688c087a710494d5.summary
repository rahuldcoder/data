-- the @entity2 is suing the maker of popular high - powered magnet " desk toys " to get them to stop selling their products , an agency spokesman said wednesday			1
the magnets can pierce holes in the intestines , and some children have needed multiple surgeries and lengthy hospitalizations			1
since 2009 , there have been at least a dozen ingestions of the magnets in @entity18 toys			1
powerful magnets in toys raise risks from swallowing the commission asked the makers of @entity18 and @entity23 to stop selling their products , but they refused , according @entity24 , a spokesman for the federal agency			1
" we 're doing this to keep children safe , " @entity24 said			0
" we want to prevent future surgeries			0
" a spokesman for @entity31 & @entity32 , the maker of @entity18 and @entity34 , said the company " will fight this vigorously			1
" " there are half a billion magnets out there , and unfortunately there are some people who have misused the product , " said @entity37			2
" we market these products to adults age 14 and above , and there are warning labels on the product			0
" there are warning labels to keep the magnets away from children on five places on each box , and in accompanying instructions			2
a public awareness campaign about magnet safety with videos distributed by the government and a special website ( www.magnetsafety.com ) was launched several months ago , with the full cooperation of the @entity2 , the company said			1
the company 's website also has warnings posted next to the images of the products			1
" obviously the bureaucrats see danger everywhere , and those responsible people -- like our company who have vigorously promoted safety and appropriate use of our products -- gets put out of business by an unfair and arbitrary process , " said @entity67 , founder and ceo of @entity31 and @entity32			2
" i do n't understand how and why they did this without following their own rules before allowing us to make our case			0
it almost seems like they simply wanted to put our products and industry out of business			0
" magnetic stress relievers called health danger for kids on friday , @entity31 and @entity32 launched a video campaign to help educate consumers about ongoing safety efforts , as well as " protest the actions of the @entity2 , " it said in a statement			1
the video can be viewed on the company 's website as well as the campaign website			1
since 2008 , the @entity2 has received 200 reports of ingestion of magnets of all kinds , @entity24 said			1
the analysis released wednesday showed more than 20 ingestions were of high - powered , " rare earth " magnets			1
in june , pediatric gastroenterologists met with the @entity2 and shared the results of an informal survey			1
thirty - four physicians reported 82 cases of high - powered magnet ingestions , most in children under age five			1
surgery was required in 26 cases to remove the magnets and nearly all required some type of endoscopy procedure			2
" we have worked with the company over the years , " @entity24 said			1
" we did a recall with them in 2010			0
yet the injuries still happened			0
in 2011 we worked with them on the education of consumers			0
so we 've reached a point where we really do need to take stronger action , which we 're doing			0
we 're filing a lawsuit			0
" several retailers , including @entity138 and @entity139 , have agreed to stop selling the magnets			2
the @entity2 rarely files such administrative complaints -- the last time it did was 11 years ago against the maker of bb guns , @entity24 said			1
" so many parents do n't know about this hazard , " @entity24 said			0
" they buy the products for themselves			0
maybe their child gets access to it			0
maybe they give it to their child			0
" and the parents just need to know that two or more magnets are swallowed by a child , even a teenager -- we 've had incidents with both young children and teenagers -- it can get caught in the small intestine , form an infection and then emergency surgery is needed			2
we want to avoid that			0
" @entity24 added that the agency is continuing to look at the safety of other brands of small , high - powered " rare earth " magnets			1
@entity172 , whose son swallowed high - powered magnets , said she was " relieved " to hear about the complaint			1
when he was almost 2 years old , her son @entity176 swallowed eight magnets and spent two months in the hospital , most of that time in intensive care			2
" this is wonderful , " she said			0
" i 'm very glad they 're taking action			0
if they ca n't sell them , then no one else can get hurt			0
" @entity187 ceo : ' rigorous standards ' after massive toy recall @entity0 's @entity190 contributed to this report .			2
