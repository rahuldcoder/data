@entity0 , @entity1 -- as tensions roil between @entity7 and city officials over accusations of police brutality , @entity5 activists will press the @entity11 for a way to have at least one elected @entity14 to represent them , leaders said thursday			1
their pledge to continue their grass - roots campaign came after the @entity11 rejected wednesday night a ballot measure that would have established voting districts , including at least one to represent @entity14 neighborhoods			1
the measure , voted down 3 - 2 after more than three hours of passionate appeals by residents , would have ended how city council members are now elected at - large			1
latino residents feel that under the current conditions they are not being represented adequately -- especially in the wake of videotaped violent confrontations between police and @entity14 residents			1
last month videos captured protestors confronting @entity0 police and officers shooting rubber bullets at mostly @entity14 residents			1
one video also shows a police dog running at several people and biting a man in the arm			2
the @entity11 is scheduled to meet again august 21 , and @entity14 residents said they would be back to call for city leadership to reflect the diversity of the community			0
" when you have a representative that lives in the neighborhood and that is elected , he 's responsible to address the needs of that community , " said @entity43 , a community activist			0
" i believe if we had districts , it would be easier for these people to deal with the socio - economic problems from our communities that have been forgotten			2
" @entity0 resident @entity57 is the son of @entity59 immigrants who supports the districting ballot measure , but told @entity2 he has an issue with the idea that new representatives have to be @entity5			1
" i think it 's all about what does a representative have to say , how are they going to fix the issues , what can they do for the community and how can they serve			0
that 's the way we should choose our officials , " @entity57 said			0
" but definitely districting will help alleviate a lot of the issues			0
" currently , 52 % of the city 's 336,000 residents are @entity14 but few have held public office			0
the @entity11 struck down the ballot measure saying it needs to be studied more and instead they will put into place a citizen 's advisory committee on elections and community involvement			1
@entity0 mayor @entity89 was among the supporters of the measure to elect council members from districts			1
" i believe @entity0 residents should have a say in how they want to be governed , " @entity89 told @entity2			2
" district elections bring government closer to the people			0
whether this is accomplished through the courts or the vote of the people , district elections are @entity0 's future			2
" also in attendance was @entity106 , the mother of @entity107 , the 25 - year - old unarmed man whom a police officer shot to death last month			1
@entity110 , spokesman for the @entity111 , said the officer fired in self - defense			2
police said @entity107 was a gang member and held a concealed object in his front waistband with both hands			0
police added that @entity107 had a criminal record that included various drug charges			0
" the entire family of @entity124 is disappointed in the council 's vote yesterday , although she appreciates the efforts of the council that voted in favor it , " @entity121 , attorney for the @entity107 family , told @entity2			0
the mother " wants people to demonstrate and make their voices heard , but peacefully			0
she 's not going to stop until there is justice for her son 's dead and fair treatment for all the people of @entity0 , " said @entity121			2
when @entity106 spoke at the council meeting , she was interrupted by a person who yelled , " you are a bad mother ! " this caused commotion as the man who shouted the comment immediately left the meeting			1
@entity107 's family filed a $ 50 million lawsuit july 24 in @entity149 against the @entity0 police department and the officers involved in the shooting			1
according to @entity121 , the money that @entity106 recovers for the death of her son will be used to create a community center or some other facility in her son 's name to benefit underserved children in the community			0
a day after @entity107 's death , police killed another man , @entity164 , 21 , after a brief pursuit that involved @entity166 allegedly opening fire on police			1
the violence sparked outrage within the community and a series of protests aimed at the police			0
on july 24 , hundreds of demonstrators flooded the streets of downtown @entity0 vandalizing shops , including smashing the windows of a @entity178 and looting apparel from retailers at the @entity182 mall			2
the violence was at odds with how @entity0 is home to @entity186 , which markets itself as the " happiest place on @entity188			1
" the @entity189 also filed a lawsuit july 28 in @entity191 suing the city of @entity0 for violating the @entity193 by excluding the city 's @entity14 community with the at - large process to elect city officials			2
the suit seeks to change @entity0 's election policies by adopting districting to guarantee diversity in representation			1
some @entity0 residents at wednesday 's meeting said the change needs to start with the police department in order to rebuild the relationship between the city and its residents			1
" i would like for the officers to be more patient , not to be so scared			0
just because of one man , does n't mean that everybody 's the same , " said @entity0 resident @entity213			1
" there 's people that are nice , that are hard workers and if there 's riots and stuff it 's because they do n't have answers			0
" other @entity14 residents at the meeting expressed their support for the actions of the police department			0
" i really think that the community needs to look at themselves , " said @entity0 resident @entity230			2
" and realize that their kids might be the problem			0
" @entity0 police officers have shot seven people , killing five , since january 1 and said the shootings are a result of the increase in gang - related crime in the last year			1
mayor @entity89 said he asked the @entity244 attorney 's office in @entity245 to investigate the @entity107 and @entity164 shootings , but said the city would not tolerate unlawful protests			0
meanwhile , more than 17,000 @entity149 residents signed a petition that was delivered july 30 to the @entity1 attorney general 's office and seeks a state investigation of the @entity0 police in the wake of the fatal shootings , according to @entity256 , a national @entity14 advocacy group that collected the petition signatures			1
" we 're trying to do the best we can in the neighborhoods that are controlled by gangs , " said @entity0 police chief @entity258			1
" we do n't want to be seen as law enforcement to come in and just do nothing but be an occupying army of a neighborhood			0
" we want to have a good relationship with our residents so that they can do more about helping us stop the crime before it occurs			0
