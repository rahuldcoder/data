when @entity8 asks " what are you doing , " maybe you should be following tweets on job advice			1
when microblogging and social networking site @entity8 debuted three years ago , plenty of people wrote it off as yet another pointless addition in the overcrowded networking world			1
considering the site only allows people to post , or @entity8 , messages of 140 characters or less , you ca n't blame early skeptics			1
but little by little , users proved the site 's worth to nonbelievers			0
last year , student @entity28 was traveling in @entity29 and wound up in jail			0

when a plane crashed into the @entity40 in january , a @entity8 user posted the first photograph from the scene			1
although we 're in the nascent stage of @entity8 's existence and therefore have no idea how long it will be around , we do know it has more growing to do			2

job seekers can follow people who will make your job search process easier , from the interviewing stage to the salary negotiations			0
i follow many people whom i think give great advice , post informative articles and know what they 're talking about			2
