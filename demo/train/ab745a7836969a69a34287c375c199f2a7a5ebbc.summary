-- the oil and gas industry 's injection of wastewater deep into the @entity5 is " a likely contributing factor " to the 50 % increase in @entity9 earthquakes since october , the @entity1 said			1
the jump in temblors significantly increases the chance for a damaging quake -- 5.5 magnitude or greater -- in the @entity17 state , the federal agency said			1
" as a result of the increased number of small and moderate shocks , the likelihood of future , damaging earthquakes has increased for central and north - central @entity9 , " the @entity1 said monday			2
the increase in earthquakes " do not seem to be due to typical , random fluctuations in natural seismicity rates , " a recent @entity1 statistical analysis found			0
rather , a finding by the @entity1 and the @entity35 " indicates that a likely contributing factor to the increase in earthquakes is wastewater disposal by injection into deep geologic formations , " the @entity1 said			1
the @entity36 , however , urged a wait - and - see approach in judging the @entity1 's assertions			0
" because crude oil and natural gas is produced in 70 of @entity9 's 77 counties , any seismic activity within the state is likely to occur near oil and natural gas activity			1
the @entity36 and the oil and gas industry as a whole support the continued study of @entity9 's increased seismic activity , but a rush to judgment provides no clear understanding of the causes , " the industry group said			1
between last october and april 14 , the state experienced 183 quakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater , the @entity1 and @entity35 said			2
that is an increase from the state 's long - term average from 1978 to 2008 of only two magnitude 3.0 or larger quakes per year			0
" the water injection can increase underground pressures , lubricate faults and cause earthquakes -- a process known as injection - induced seismicity , " the @entity1 said			0
" much of this wastewater is a byproduct of oil and gas production and is routinely disposed of by injection into wells specifically designed and approved for this purpose			2
" to better gauge the increased quakes , the @entity1 and @entity9 officials have added monitoring stations , which now stand at 15 permanent facilities and 17 temporary stations , the agency said			0
in 2012 : debate over fracking , quakes get louder what you need to know about earthquakes measuring the magnitude of earthquakes the place where two earthquakes hit every hour			0

@entity9 sees 50 % jump in earthquake rate since october
a ' likely ' factor for the increase is oil and gas industry 's wastewater wells , @entity1 says
industry group urges *caution* in rushing to any judgment
@entity1 : @entity9 now faces greater risk for a major one , 5.5 magnitude or greater
