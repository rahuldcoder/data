@entity1 , @entity0 -- in february 2009 , @entity3 got called to gov. @entity5 's office			1
@entity3 was then chairman of the @entity6 , an agency set up in 2005 to regulate state crime labs after a series of embarrassing scandals			2
the first matter on its plate involved the 2004 execution of @entity13 , whose murder conviction rested largely on testimony that many arson experts now call outdated and incorrect			1
aides to @entity5 , who allowed @entity13 's execution to go forward , started off with general questions about how things were going at the commission , a relatively new agency , @entity3 said			1
but then they started asking about @entity13 , questioning whether the commission 's review of the evidence in his case was beyond its legal powers			1
" as soon as we started discussing the @entity13 investigation , the meeting got more confrontational and more difficult , " @entity3 said			2
about six months later , @entity3 's term on the commission was up -- and despite letters from members urging his reappointment , @entity5 replaced him and three other appointees			1
the move came at what @entity3 calls a " critical point , " two days before the commission was to hear from an expert who had delivered a scathing report on the @entity13 case			1
the governor 's new pick for chairman soon put the brakes on the investigation , raising some of the same questions about the commission 's authority that @entity3 said @entity5 's aides had			1
and in july , with @entity5 gearing up for a run for president , the state 's attorney general delivered an opinion that appears to sharply limit the commission 's authority			1
the @entity6 is meeting thursday to decide what it can still do in light of that opinion			0
for @entity3 , an @entity1 defense lawyer , it 's the culmination of what he now calls a methodical campaign to shut down an investigation that might embarrass @entity5			1
" at first , when i was replaced , i gave the governor the benefit of the doubt , " he said			0
" but now that time has passed , i 've seen this kind of endless drumbeat of strategies and actions to stop this investigation , and it 's been terribly disappointing			0
" @entity5 's campaign dismissed @entity3 's accusations wednesday , repeating the governor 's characterization of @entity13 as a " monster " who had sent his three young daughters to a fiery death			1
" the case has been scrutinized and reviewed by a jury , state and federal courts , the news media , anti-death penalty activists and the @entity6 , " @entity5 spokesman @entity85 told @entity2 in an e-mail			2
" @entity13 was guilty of murdering his children			0
" the statement did not directly address @entity3 's accusations			2
@entity3 's role in the matter ended in october 2009			0
he said @entity5 's office called him just days before the commission was slated to hear from the expert it hired to review the evidence in the @entity13 case			1
he said a @entity5 aide thanked him for his service , but told him @entity5 " wants to take the commission in a different direction			0
" though the shakeup was controversial at the time , it was barely mentioned in @entity5 's 2010 re-election campaign			1
@entity5 is now seeking the @entity110 nomination for president , and @entity3 says the @entity13 case is a window into @entity5 's leadership			1
" he 's not always open to any contradictory viewpoints that could actually be helpful , " said @entity3 , who describes himself as a @entity115 - leaning supporter of capital punishment in some cases			0
when the @entity13 last - minute plea for a stay came before him , " there was nobody at the helm to raise a flag and tell him , ' this is serious ... this guy may have been convicted on faulty science , ' " @entity3 said			2
@entity3 said july 's opinion from @entity0 attorney general @entity131 " provides governor @entity5 with the cover he probably needs to totally squash the investigation			2
" representatives of the attorney general 's office raised no concerns about the @entity6 's jurisdiction when the panel voted unanimously to take on the @entity13 investigation , he said			0
the @entity139 man was put to death in february 2004			0
it was one of 234 executions @entity5 has overseen as the longest - serving @entity144 governor and the head of the most death - penalty - friendly state			0
authorities in @entity139 say they remain convinced of @entity13 's guilt , arguing that other evidence beyond the now - challenged arson testimony supported his conviction			1
the state fire marshal 's office has told the @entity6 it stands by the findings in his case			0
@entity3 said the commission was never looking into whether @entity13 was innocent -- but he said much of the evidence cited in his trial is now considered " junk science			1
" @entity5 's campaign also noted that @entity13 's ex-wife now believes in his guilt			1
and his state office told @entity2 that @entity13 " had full access to every level of the appeals process , and his conviction was consistently upheld			2
" " his conviction was reviewed and upheld by multiple levels of state and federal courts , including nine federal courts -- four times by the @entity144 @entity175 alone over the course of more than a decade , " deputy press secretary @entity167 said in a written response to questions by @entity2			0
in @entity13 's case , @entity5 's office says the governor was briefed on a last - minute filing by @entity1 - based fire science expert @entity181 that found the deadly blaze was likely not arson , but he refused to grant a stay of execution for further investigation			1
@entity167 told @entity2 that @entity181 's review of investigators ' findings in the @entity13 fire was also reviewed by appeals courts and the state @entity192 , which rebuffed a plea for clemency			2
state and federal appeals courts " agreed that the new opinion by @entity181 was simply an opinion and did not merit reopening the case , " she wrote			0
two subsequent reviews have backed up @entity181 's conclusions , finding that advances in the science of arson investigation since @entity13 's trial rendered obsolete most of the signs that fire marshals pointed to as evidence of arson in the case			1
in the 1990s , researchers determined that several of the things cited in @entity13 's trial were likely to be produced in fully involved accidental fires			2
the appearance of spider web - like cracks in panes of glass , once believed to have been the result of fires started with flammable liquids , turned out to be caused by the rapid cooling of windows sprayed with water			0
experiments conducted during that period showed burn patterns once thought to show multiple points of origin -- another possible indicator of arson -- also appear when the intense heat of even an accidental blaze radiates downward and sets items like furniture and carpet afire			0
the most recent review was conducted by @entity240 arson expert @entity239 at the request of the @entity6			0
@entity239 , then chairman of the @entity242 , sharply criticized the testimony against @entity13 and questioned whether it met even the standards of the day			0
@entity239 ultimately appeared before the commission in january 2011 , 15 months after he had been scheduled to answer questions about his report			0
the commission began looking into @entity13 's conviction at the request of @entity13 's family and @entity252 , which works on behalf of inmates it believes are wrongly convicted			1
the group has blasted @entity5 over his role in the issue , accusing him of trying to shut down the probe			0
@entity261 , the group 's policy director , told @entity2 that the investigation should go forward for the sake of hundreds of other prisoners now serving time for arson , some of whom also may have been convicted based on outdated fire science			2
" the @entity13 case really demonstrates how severe the consequences can be when you use bad forensic evidence , " @entity261 said .			0

the former chairman of a state commission criticizes gov. @entity5
@entity3 says the case is a window into @entity5 's leadership
@entity5 signed off on @entity13 's execution in 2004
arson experts say conviction was *partly* based on " junk science "
