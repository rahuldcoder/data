-- @entity2 coach @entity1 hailed his team after qualifying from the toughest group at the @entity5 in @entity6 , becoming the first team to reach the quarterfinals after beating @entity9 on saturday			1
@entity2 , seeking a record fourth title but first since 1976 , followed up the opening 2 - 1 win over defending champions @entity14 with a 1 - 0 victory in @entity16 thanks to a second - half goal from @entity19 to go through with a match to spare			1
@entity14 's chances of going through were boosted by a last - gasp 1 - 0 win over the @entity23 in saturday 's second @entity25 fixture			1
the result left @entity14 three points behind @entity2 on three , with @entity9 and the @entity23 on one			1
" the qualification of our team , for me , is a fantastic accomplishment , " @entity1 , who moved to the @entity28 in his teens and learned to coach there , told the @entity5 website			2
an ominous sign ahead of the @entity36 ? " our group was the ' group of death ' and i still believe it is the most difficult group in the tournament			0
to achieve this result two games in a row , i 'm very proud of my players			0
" @entity2 is capable of playing much better football			2
we will show that in the coming games			0
we will be fitter and more confident and hopefully you 'll see much better performances from our team			0
" @entity19 , a 20 - year - old striker , struck the winner in the 63rd minute from @entity51 's cross after @entity2 struggled to break down the well - organized @entity53 defense			1
" playing @entity9 is always difficult			2
they defend with numbers , they are organized , they are disciplined , they fight , they have pace and they are dangerous on the counter-attack , " @entity1 said			0
socceroos deny @entity64 @entity9 's best chance came when @entity67 's shot shaved the crossbar in time added on , leaving his team needing to beat @entity14 in wednesday 's final round of matches			1
" the next match is very critical for our team to go for the knockout stage but we will try our best , " @entity9 coach @entity74 - sop said			1
" in terms of the system , we converted to 4 - 4 - 2 and we combine attack and defense , and in this way we created new tactics for our team			0
for the next match , i think we have to again put the emphasis on defense and try to score goals on the counter-attack			0
" the @entity23 seemed set to have earned a second successive goalless draw until an own - goal by defender @entity90 in the third minute of time added on gave @entity14 a much - needed victory			1
@entity23 defender @entity93 headed against the post early on and striker @entity95 missed from close range , while @entity14 hit the woodwork twice just before halftime through @entity99 and @entity100			2
@entity95 smashed a shot against the bar after the hour mark , but the unlucky @entity90 decisively turned the ball into his own net in injury - time as he tried to cut out a cross from @entity14 captain @entity107			1
" it was a little bit lucky but at the end of the day we tried our best to force our luck in the game , " @entity14 's @entity109 coach @entity108 said			2
" we had three strikers up front and i believe that we were rewarded			0
sometimes if you have bad luck , you must force your luck to get it back			0
i believe that today we managed to force our own luck and we did it with a fighting spirit			0

three - time champions @entity2 beat @entity9 to reach last eight at @entity5
@entity19 's second - half winner puts @entity2 through ahead of final @entity25 match
