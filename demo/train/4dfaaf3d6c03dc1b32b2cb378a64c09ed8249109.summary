-- president @entity1 and his family leave friday for a weekend getaway to @entity4 , but along with a little rest and relaxation comes criticism that the president is taking it easy while oil continues to gush in the @entity10			1
the @entity11 plan to spend the weekend on @entity12 , home of @entity13			1
the trip marks the president 's third vacation since the oil disaster began in april			2
the @entity18 launched a website blasting what it considers @entity1 's " leisure activities or missteps " during the oil disaster , like playing golf , attending concerts and vacationing in @entity26 , @entity27 ; @entity28 , @entity29 ; and now @entity4			1
@entity1 has also faced criticism for scheduling a trip up north , instead of vacationing in the @entity10 , as he advised other @entity32 to do			1
" presidents are certainly entitled to vacation , just like everybody else , but there is a fine line as to when presidents should do it , what they should and where they should do it , " said @entity33 , a former member of president @entity36 's senior staff and the deputy assistant for appointments and scheduling			1
" presidents have to be cognizant of the fact that everything they do is going to be scrutinized , " said @entity50 , who also is a professor for @entity52 's semester in @entity54 program			0
@entity59 strategist @entity58 said the @entity18 criticism is " galling , " considering @entity36 's frequent trips to @entity62 and his home in @entity64 , @entity65			1
" @entity1 is working as hard as any president that we 've had in recent history and certainly harder than the most immediate previous president , " he said			2
@entity72 's @entity71 , who keeps track of presidents ' comings and goings , calculated that @entity36 spent all or part of 977 days at @entity62 or in @entity65 during his two terms			2
@entity50 noted that visits to those locations were working trips and not getaways			0
@entity36 's staff would travel with him , and work would continue as usual			1
the @entity64 ranch was known as the " western @entity86 " because of the infrastructure there			0
as for calls that @entity1 should vacation in the @entity10 , @entity58 said , " where he chooses to take his days off should really be up to him			0
we do n't want to get into a situation where the president is making familial vacation decisions based upon polling or political maneuvers			0
" @entity98 , @entity36 's deputy press secretary who often traveled with the president when he was away from the @entity86 , said that changing locations provided a good opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle of @entity54			1
" president @entity36 , on the weekends , would often go to @entity62 because the size of the bubble you are in expands , so you can go out for a walk or bike ride without having to arrange security detail , " he said			2
@entity98 was in @entity64 with @entity36 for a number of crises that could not have been planned for , like the conviction of @entity116 , the death of president @entity118 and the assassination of @entity121 politician @entity120			2
@entity36 was notified of @entity120 's death immediately and delivered a statement to the press pool			0
" it would have almost been like we were at the @entity86 in terms of the teams that would convene and talk about the issues surrounding that assassination , " @entity98 said			0
the problem for @entity1 , @entity98 said , is the visuals that could come out of his trip			0
a picture of @entity1 playing golf alongside images from the @entity10 could send a negative message			0
@entity138 , a @entity0 contributor and former adviser to president @entity141 , said that vacationing or not , " the president is the president wherever he is			1
" i thought it was silly when people attacked @entity36 for going on vacation , so i 'll be consistent and say it 's silly when people attack president @entity1 for going on vacation , " he said			1
" of all of the concerns that @entity32 may have , they do not need to worry whether president @entity1 is a hard - working man			0
they may agree or disagree with his policies , but there is just no doubt that the guy is busting his rear end			0
