@entity0 is a blogger , freelance journalist and documentary filmmaker based in @entity3 and @entity4			1
@entity4 , @entity5 -- when i heard @entity7 was coming to @entity4 , i jumped at the opportunity to show the world a different side of the country i had grown up in			1
so i hit the phones , tracked down the promoter and before i knew it , i was driving to the airport to film @entity7 's arrival			2
@entity4 blogger @entity0 with @entity17 rap legend @entity7			1
when i first met the @entity7 ( as he 's known by his very courteous suit - wearing bodyguards ) , he was seated in the vip lounge of @entity21 , surrounded by entourage while awaiting passport control			0
the @entity17 rap legend had never been to the @entity25 before , and i was wondering why he decided to perform in @entity4 of all cities			1
outfitted in a hooded sweater , despite the sweltering heat of the @entity4 summer , @entity7 leaned forward and told me in his low voice : " there are a lot of places i could have started but i chose to start here because i felt they 've been supporting me you know -- they 've been down with me for long time			2
" by " starting " in @entity5 , @entity7 meant that he intended to embark on a @entity25 tour in the coming months			1
" me and my man @entity42 had a nice conversation about putting together a @entity45 tour ... so we gon na try to get that together over the next couple of months , " @entity7 , flanked by his forever - smiling local organizer , @entity5 entertainment mogul , @entity38 , told a room full of eager photographers and entertainment journalists			2
but the @entity5 paparazzi still wondered , why @entity4 ? " this is my first chance to party with the people of @entity5 , " @entity7 said			1
" they were always partying to my music but now they get a chance to actually party with @entity7			0
" this is the party capital of the world , " he added and the room filled with applause			1
hours later , @entity7 drove the locals wild once again during his performance in front of thousands of adoring young fans by holding up a @entity5 flag on stage and then performing an impromptu sing - along with the chorus line " @entity4 , @entity5			1
" when the show ended just before one a.m. , @entity7 did not leave @entity4 without living up to his promise to party hard			1
acting on a tip from a source close to @entity7 's circle , i managed to follow @entity7 's entourage to the afterparty , at a massive and highly exclusive rooftop club overlooking the @entity79 and the @entity5 mountains			1
i entered the club through the back entrance with members of @entity7 's band that i had met at the airport			0
when we got inside , the champagne was flowing and the club was rocking with hundreds of people			0
a mixture of house and trance music reverberated across all surfaces as fireworks lit up the evening sky			0
@entity7 's band and crew were ecstatic , sporting looks of awe when they reached their vip tables in the balcony section which boasts outdoor air conditioning			0
and even though the @entity105 electric beat was quite a stretch from the hip hop he produces , @entity7 himself seemed to be getting down -- waving his hands in the air			0
but it was n't long before the @entity7 switched things up grabbed the microphone : " you are now rocking with the big @entity115 double jizzle for shizzle dizzle " he said , sending screams through the glamorous crowd			0
then he turned toward the @entity119 podium : " hey ! yo ! @entity119 ! why do n't you play some of that @entity7 sh * t ? once again the crowd was electrified , as @entity7 began rapping to his track " @entity125 , " ( part of the that performance is available on @entity7 's web site			0
) later he played other local favorites such as " @entity129 " and then rocked to a new track " that 's the homie " from his upcoming album " @entity133 " while being filmed by two cameraman and a flash light			0
the @entity4 show producer , @entity38 later explained that @entity7 was actually filming part of the music video for the new track that night			1
and when @entity7 left the club at 3 a.m. , the party continued till seven in the morning , according to @entity38 , in true @entity7 fashion , back at the hotel			0
@entity38 says he 's now preparing for @entity7 's @entity25 tour beginning in december , with a focus on cities in the oil - rich @entity147 , such as the @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and maybe even @entity152			2
though it remains unclear how much @entity38 actually paid @entity7 to perform in @entity4 , he emphasized that the bidding process was intense with much competition from promoters in other @entity158 countries			2
