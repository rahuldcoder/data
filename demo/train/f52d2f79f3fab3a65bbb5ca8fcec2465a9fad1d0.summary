-- the new year emerges from the depths of winter			2
in many countries bells ring out at midnight on @entity3 -- a sound that the writer @entity5 described nearly 200 years ago as the most regretful sound he ever heard , reminding him of everything he had suffered or neglected in the past 12 months			0
more recently , though , fireworks have usually taken over this role in providing a fanfare for the coming year all over the world , from @entity13 to the beaches of @entity15 , to hamlets deep in the @entity18 countryside			1
this shift from peals of bells to spectacular explosions is suggestive			1
we live now in a world that is turning its back on the old traditions and the old skills and replacing them with something far bigger and much louder , far more brash and much more expensive ; a reminder too of technology and military might			1
my new book , " @entity36 , " investigates how we are becoming cut off from the rhythm of the natural world and the ways in which the annual cycle has been celebrated for centuries			0
in the past , the customs and rituals that marked the passing of the year linked society and culture to the environment , and in doing so reflected their values of community and ecology			1
today , however , we are witnessing the eradication of the seasons with all - year produce and the replacement of local festivities with mass celebrations of a tiny handful of uniform events , turning contemporary society into an identikit culture with a standardized marketplace			0
my answer is not only that we should revive forgotten customs , but that we can also establish new traditions that properly reflect today 's values and ambitions			1
in fact , the celebration of the new year is an excellent example of how quickly major festivals can be established			1
just as many old @entity18 festivals have their roots in the classical @entity74 culture of ancient @entity75 and @entity76 , so much of the @entity18 - speaking world still follows customs that originated in northeast @entity80 @entity79 and @entity81 200 or 300 years ago , adapting these traditions to their own climate and culture			1
the practice of kissing and singing to welcome in the new year was noted in @entity18 by the @entity87 novelist @entity86 in 1856 , but there are in fact very few @entity18 traditions for @entity91 -- not least because until 1752 the new year in @entity18 was celebrated march 25			1
but in @entity93 the practice was to begin the @entity94 on january 1 with " @entity95 , " which the @entity93 celebrate with new year customs such as " first - footing			1
" new year celebrations in the @entity18 - speaking world are consequently cosmopolitan affairs , mixing @entity93 festivities with other @entity103 traditions			1
setting the tone the month of " january , " deriving from the latin " janua " meaning " door , " is a transitional time between the old and new , the past and the future			0
for centuries , january was a key time for setting one 's house in order and making plans for the forthcoming year			2
eat a hen in january , for instance , if you wish to live through the year ; observe the weather on january 12 , to get a taste of the weather for the next 12 months ; and note that activities undertaken on january 1 set the tone of work for the rest of the year -- an early version of new year resolutions			2
settle down to some seasonal fare , from nutmeg cakes with currant eyes known as " @entity129 " to the wassail cup , a spiced drink shared among family and friends			0
and there 's no need to take @entity137 decorations down on the @entity138 ( january 6 ) -- that became common practice in the nineteenth century to get everyone back to work			0
before then , it was felt that during the bleakest months of the year in the northern hemisphere there was good reason to keep one 's house decorated			0
so the holly and the ivy , bay leaves , and mistletoe , stayed up until @entity152 on february 2 , a tradition that has survived in parts of @entity155			0
easter the joker in the pack the new year also presents a more profound opportunity to reclaim our individuality and our humanity			1
as we look forward to the coming year , we can not but be reminded that the calendar of every year is different : days and dates shift ( will you have a weekend birthday this year ? ) , leap days and leap years can disrupt the best - laid plans , and @entity168 is ever the amiable joker - in - the - pack			2
the hair - raisingly complicated calculation of @entity168 , based on both the spring solstice and the lunar cycle , is currently computed by @entity175 astronomers using a 14 - step algorithm			0
even so , minor variations in the @entity179 's orbit mean that @entity168 can not be predicted with absolute accuracy			0
it is a humbling reminder of the limits of human control -- and also wonderfully appropriate that such unpredictability can still structure everything from university terms to television schedules , let alone family customs in making and hiding @entity168 eggs			0
quirky and changeable the year may be , but then so are we -- let 's celebrate that			0
" the seasons : an elegy for the @entity196 , " by @entity197 is published by @entity80 books the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

the shift from bells to fireworks to bring in the new year is suggestive , says @entity197
the world is replacing old traditions with something far louder and brasher , he says
old customs should be revived , new ones established to reflect current values , @entity197 says
he argues january provides an opportunity to reclaim our individuality and our humanity
