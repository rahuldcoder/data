-- it was inevitable that the debate over same - sex marriage would have a strong religious component			1
this is partly because it involves such questions as the interpretation of biblical passages that , on their face , condemn homosexuality as a sin			0
but it also involves squaring the authority of ancient texts with modern theological understanding and developments in biology			0
and of course , the importance of love and human autonomy as religious values should be considered			0
those issues surfaced in the various briefs filed in the @entity28 , some of which are written as if the court must inevitably choose one religious point of view as the winner and the other as the loser			0
this is a false choice			0
the @entity28 can make all winners , or at least avoid allowing one side to suppress the other 's deepest beliefs			0
the @entity40 @entity28 has not been asked -- nor could it possibly answer -- the question of what @entity42 or the @entity43 thinks about same - sex marriage			1
religious groups are divided on that question , some supporting and others opposing same - sex marriage			1
and even if the religious viewpoint were clear , it should play no direct role in deciding whether the @entity53 requires the states or the federal government to recognize same - sex marriage			1
our government should not act to further one or another religious view of contested moral issues			2
opinion : the real ' modern family ' in @entity40 neither the court nor government may referee religious disputes			0
under the @entity53 , religious groups are free to urge and put into practice their different visions of the good , of moral life , and compete for adherents in the marketplace of ideas			0
winners and losers are determined by the " votes " of individuals and congregations , of believers and nonbelievers , not by government bodies			0
neither can citizens opposed to same - sex marriage demand that the government refuse recognition to such marriages in order to avoid offending their religious sensibilities			1
religious liberty , as the @entity89 told the @entity28 recently in a friend - of - the - court brief , does not give anyone the right to demand that someone else be deprived of the " right to live the most intimate portions of their lives according to their own deepest convictions			2
" that some religious groups regard same - sex marriage as an " abomination " does not authorize the government to ban such relationships			1
that is one price we all pay for protecting religious liberty			2
conversely , when government does recognize same - sex marriage , it creates a new set of problems for the liberties of religious believers			1
these extend well beyond the right of clergy or houses of worship not to perform or host same - sex ceremonies , or the right of religious institutions opposed to same - sex marriage to remain tax exempt			1
@entity122 : the county where no one 's gay among other likely questions that will arise are these : -- must rabbis , priests and pastors provide religious marriage counseling to same - sex couples ? -- must religious colleges provide married - student housing to same - sex couples ? -- must churches and synagogues employ spouses who are in same - sex marriages , even though such employees would be persistently and publicly flouting the religious teachings they would be hired to promote ? -- must religious social service agencies place children for adoption with same - sex couples ? already , @entity146 in @entity147 , @entity148 , and the @entity149 have closed their adoption units because of this issue			1
resolving these conflicts will not be easy			0
in some instances the rights of same - sex couples will unavoidably trump religious liberty rights -- for example , the much discussed question of visits to spouses in intensive care units			1
but there will be cases where religious liberty will trump , and same - sex couples will have to accept the reality that not everyone accepts their relationships as legitimate			1
this , too , is a price to be paid for religious liberty			0
same - sex couples should not be denied the right to civil marriage ; that is the immediate issue in the cases now before the @entity28			2
and when that right is secured , same - sex couples should not , without very good reason , be allowed to force dissenting religious organizations to recognize or facilitate their marriages			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			0

@entity181 : the debate over same - sex marriage has a strong religious component
@entity179 : government should not further one religious view over another on gay marriage
he gives an example -- must religious colleges provide housing to same - sex couples ?
@entity179 : a *key* question is whether recognizing gay marriage infringes upon religious liberty
