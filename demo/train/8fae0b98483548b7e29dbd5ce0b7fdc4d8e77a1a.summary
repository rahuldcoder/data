-- like @entity2 , who ran to freedom monday after years in captivity , @entity1 was abducted and held by a male captor not far from her @entity7 home			1
@entity8 , whom police took to safety along with two other women they rescued from a home at 2207 @entity14 , could be seen healthy and beaming in a photo snapped monday at an area hospital			1
she endured 10 years of confinement , but her life will go on			2
her life and those of 10 others ended just over five miles away in the notorious " @entity22 , " at 12205 @entity23 , at the hands of convicted sex offender @entity25 , who had moved to the address after serving 15 years in prison for attempted rape			1
many of their bodies were exhumed in october 2009 from shallow graves on @entity25 's property			1
when news of the serial killing broke back then , the investigation revealed that all of the victims had ties to the neighborhood where they died			1
things in common at that time , the grisly graveyard at @entity25 's @entity7 home made @entity8 's aunt think of her lost niece			1
" she 's got to be around ( her neighborhood ) somewhere then , " @entity47 told @entity0 's @entity48 on monday			1
indeed , @entity47 was onto something			2
@entity8 and one of the other women , whom police say @entity2 held captive , disappeared from the same neighborhood , within five blocks of each other , starting in 2003			1
the third one was last seen about two miles away from the neighborhood , according to the @entity59			1
@entity8 was 16 when she vanished on april 21 , 2003 , after she left her job at a @entity63 just a few blocks away from home , the @entity60 said then			2
@entity47 never gave up hope that @entity8 was still alive			0
" me and my daughter -- neither one did , " she said			0
she was ecstatic when she heard her niece is free and still alive			0
" i 'm just happy and excited , " she said			0
" it 's just so great ! " unfortunately , @entity8 's mother , @entity71 , died in 2006			1
she did not live long enough to share in the joy			0
" she went with a broken heart , " @entity47 lamented			0
@entity8 and the two others had something else in common : they were teenagers at the time of their abductions			1
@entity2 was 14 , when she went missing			0
@entity22 the @entity81 victims also had a common profile : they were all @entity84 mothers who had hit upon hard times			1
almost all of them struggled with drug addiction at some time in their lives , and many turned to prostitution and stealing to support their habits , according to court records			0
@entity1 , who was 52 when she vanished , had routinely left home for days or weeks at a time			0
so , on november 10 , 2008 , when her children heard she was missing , it seemed , sadly , like nothing new			0
four women had fallen victim to @entity25 before her			1
most of them were over 40			0
they all disappeared in the same neighborhood , and their bodies lay on one man 's property			1
@entity1 's body was the first to be identified			2
her remains were unearthed from a grave in the backyard , decayed beyond recognition , except for plastic jewelry falling off her skeletal fingers			0
police believe the women were easy prey for @entity25			2
nobody cared ? criminologists say serial killers often target people whose lives may be messy or off the grid -- prostitutes , runaways and drug users -- because their absences might not raise red flags , even for their families			0
after pleading not guilty by reason of insanity , @entity25 was convicted in july 2011 of 11 murders , a few rapes and other related charges , according to the @entity59			2
the court sentenced him to death			0
after the bodies were discovered , other women came forward , alleging @entity25 attacked them			1
his home was in a neighborhood that care forgot			2
his two - story house sat in a dilapidated neighborhood known as @entity141 , where one in five homes were in foreclosure and at least a third of the residents receive food stamps , according to a study by @entity149 's @entity148 and @entity150			1
neighbors and even a councilman had failed to realize that a stench wafting in the area around @entity25 's home was rotting human flesh			2
some in the neighborhood complained then that another factor may have been in play : no one cared when 11 destitute @entity84 - @entity84 women died			1
trend : escaping alive more and more people who were abducted escape alive , a spokesman for a nonprofit organization that tracks missing children told @entity48			0
" we are seeing more of them being found as survivors like the three women in @entity7 , " said @entity168 , ceo of the @entity169			2
but years in captivity can turn into decades of confinement			0
" we actually celebrated this past summer the longest recovery of a missing person , " @entity168 said			0
a boy kidnapped at age 2 was found 41 years later and reunited with his mother			0
despite the proximity of the @entity22 and the similarities between these two grim cases , there is one difference that many were cheering monday			1
the girls who were allegedly abducted and held at 2207 @entity14 made it out alive .			0

the abductions of women freed monday have things in common with the " @entity22 "
in october 2009 , 11 *female* bodies were discovered at one man 's property
the women in both cases had things in common with each other
in both cases , the abductions occurred in a neighborhood the women knew
