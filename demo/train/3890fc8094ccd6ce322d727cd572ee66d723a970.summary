-- not so long ago , the idea of a @entity3 movie seemed like a certainty			2
how could @entity5 resist the chance to adapt the sensational murder case ? after all , producers did n't hesitate to turn the @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity12 sagas into tv movies			1
and interest in those cases pales compared to @entity16 , whose trial became the must - see television event of the summer			1
but the public outrage over @entity16 's acquittal on murder charges is making some in the industry rethink the wisdom of adapting her story to the screen			1
" anyone who pursued a movie based on these events , especially right now , will face some immediate backlash , " said @entity27 , news director for the @entity28			1
" the nerve is so raw on this and so many people are so outraged by the verdict that anything that is seen as an attempt to exploit this , especially if the family is involved , will be seen as a negative by most of the people who followed the trial , " @entity27 told @entity0			2
the cable channel @entity43 would seem the logical home for an @entity16 movie -- it aired the @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity12 films , and it 's in production on a movie about murder suspect @entity51 ( with @entity52 in the lead )			1
but when @entity0 asked the network if it was pursuing an @entity16 project , @entity43 said it had " nothing in development			1
" when we asked if the network had obtained the rights to any of the central players in the case , we got the same response : " we have nothing in development			0
" the mere hint of a connection to the @entity68 has sent @entity5 talent agencies diving for cover			0
when an erroneous report circulated last week that @entity73 had signed @entity16 for representation , the agency was inundated with protest calls			1
it quickly sent out word denying the report			0
and @entity78 , another big talent agency , signed @entity16 's lead attorney , @entity79 , for representation , only to " un-sign " him several hours later after facing a drumbeat of criticism			1
actress @entity83 , who told @entity0 she watched " every minute " of the trial , is among those angered about the prospect of @entity16 cashing in by selling the rights to her story			1
" if that girl [ @entity16 ] makes one dime off of the death of her child , i 'm just telling you that i feel like @entity96 is going to be like , ' we are so done with you ! ' " she told @entity0			2
" i 'm upset because the opportunity to profit from a tragedy is laid out for this girl on a silver platter , " @entity97 said			1
comedian and social commentator @entity102 told @entity0 she could imagine a @entity3 movie under certain circumstances			0
" i do think there should be a movie made " about the case , @entity106 said			2
" but i want the person that does the movie to be a neutral person , because that way , we 'll get more of a balanced movie , versus @entity3 doing the movie , because then it 'll slant her way , and it 's going to be filled with even more lies			2
" the possibility of a movie has inevitably spawned water cooler talk in @entity5 about who should play @entity16			1
@entity106 likes @entity127 for the role			0
" i think she 's got the chops , " @entity106 said			0
the @entity28 's @entity130 picked " @entity132 " star @entity131			0
@entity97 told us she would cast @entity134 or @entity135			0
to play @entity3 's father , the white - haired @entity16 , we heard suggestions of @entity138 of " @entity140 " fame , @entity141 and @entity142			1
speculation about casting the movie may be more than just idle chatter			0
some people remain convinced there will be a @entity3 movie , including the @entity28 's @entity27			2
" you 've got to believe that something this high - profile , something that everyone is talking about ... that eventually , this will become a movie , " he told @entity0			0
the surprising verdict in the case only makes that more likely , @entity27 said			0
" then you have this outcome that many people ca n't reconcile with the facts , " he said			0
" that conflict presents good fodder for a film			0

@entity10 , @entity9 , @entity12 sagas were turned into tv movies
right now , an @entity16 movie maker " will face some immediate backlash , " *journalist* says
actress who followed the trial does n't like " the opportunity to profit from a tragedy "
but many think it 's inevitable that the @entity16 story will be made into a movie
