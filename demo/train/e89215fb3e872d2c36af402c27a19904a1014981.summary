-- whenever the @entity3 @entity2 changes the way it screens passengers , it 's bound to cause a stir			1
this time is no different			2
the @entity2 's move this week to allow small pocket knives on airplanes has generated a storm of criticism and concern among aviation professionals and passengers alike			1
critics are outraged by a new rule that will allow knives with very short blades onto aircraft			1
the agency says it believes knives can not be used to hijack planes because of strengthened cockpit doors and more passenger awareness			2
" this policy reversal is against the best interest of the security of crew and passengers in the aircraft cabin and we will stop at nothing to fight it , " said the @entity26 , in a press statement issued thursday announcing its campaign to reverse the @entity2 's decision			1
the coalition represents nearly 90,000 unionized flight attendants at carriers across the country			1
former flight attendant @entity41 is " stupefied " by the @entity2 's decision to allow knives " especially since the process that turns checkpoints into maddening logjams -- removing shoes , liquids and computers -- remains unchanged , " she wrote in an opinion column for @entity0			1
under the new rules , knives with blades that are 2.36 inches ( 6 centimeters ) or shorter and less than a 1/2 inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins as long as the blade is not fixed or does not lock into place			2
razor blades and box cutters are still prohibited			2
the rules also allow passengers to carry two golf clubs , toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles , hockey sticks , lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry - on luggage			2
@entity2 chief @entity69 said the changes , which will take effect april 25 and will bring the @entity3 into alignment with international rules , are in keeping with his " risk - based security " approach			1
putting less focus on these items will permit airport screeners to focus on looking for bomb components , which present a greater threat to aircraft			0
new rule does n't go far enough , former chief says sharp objects can no longer bring down aircraft , former @entity2 chief @entity84 told @entity0 , and the search for knives interferes with the search for objects that can threaten aircraft			1
" they ought to let everything on that is sharp and pointy			0
battle axes , machetes ... bring anything you want that is pointy and sharp because while you may be able to commit an act of violence , you will not be able to take over the plane			0
it is as simple as that , " said @entity84 , who oversaw the @entity2 from mid- 2005 through early 2009			1
focusing on the wrong threat security expert @entity107 says the @entity2 should focus on risky people rather than risky objects			1
" when you have someone like you or me who does n't intend to attack a flight , whether we have a @entity122 knife in our pocket or not does n't make any difference , " said @entity107 , president of @entity111 - based @entity110 and former head of security of @entity114 near @entity115 , @entity116			1
" if you have somebody like one of the terrorists ( who was involved in the 9/11 attacks ) or a terrorist who is still out there , i 'm not sure we 'd want him to have even a @entity122 knife , " @entity107 said			0
" risk is not measured by the item , whether it is a knife or gun			0
it is measured by the person holding it			0
a bad guy with a @entity122 knife can still cause a lot of damage to the crew and passengers in the cabin before the aircraft can land			0
" what 's critical is to be able to apply a heightened level of search to potentially dangerous people beyond who 's on the " @entity156 " list , he said			0
the shoe bomber and underwear bomber " are people who could have been identified as high risk passengers if we had bothered to screen them , " he said , referring to @entity158 's attempted airline attack in 2001 and an attempted attack in 2009 by @entity160			0
some clues : " both of them bought one - way tickets , paid in cash , both of them did n't check any baggage for a trans - @entity174 flight			1
they should have been subjected to a different level of search , " @entity107 said			0
@entity179 's ultimate goal while he sympathizes with the concerns of flight attendants that knives and other objects could be used to hurt people , there are already objects in the cabin that mentally or emotionally disturbed people could use to inflict injury , said @entity191 , @entity192 's chief academic officer and director of terrorism , intelligence and security studies			1
" that has nothing to do with terrorism , " said @entity191			0
" given that any organization , including the @entity2 , has only so many people and so much money , what they 're trying to do is get less relevant things out of their attention and pay more attention to things that are more catastrophic			1
" an ever changing list of banned objects the @entity2 's evolving list of banned objects has drawn mixed reaction from travelers			1
" let 's allow knives on board , but you are not allowed a bottle of water , or a bottle of baby food , " wrote one @entity0 reader			2
another seemed to take a more positive view : " i almost had my kids ' safety scissors confiscated from their little activity kit			0
yay for this sensible decision			0
" commenter @entity228 was more skeptical			0
" yeah sure one man against a bunch of others is no match but , what if ten men carrying knives and bats plot to take over ? would n't a massacre be obvious ? " @entity228 wrote			1
a more flexible aviation security system ? a country 's security services need to be collecting intelligence on potential terrorists way before passengers board an aircraft , said @entity191			2
and any airport 's security team needs to have flexible and layered screening in place to be able to adjust its processes for high - risk individuals			2
" the threat is ever - changing			0
" @entity0 's @entity252 contributed to this report			0

the latest @entity2 move to allow some knives and sports *equipment* is causing a furor
flight attendants have created *petitions* demanding the @entity2 reverse its policy
security experts say the policy does n't address the need to evaluate travelers , not things
