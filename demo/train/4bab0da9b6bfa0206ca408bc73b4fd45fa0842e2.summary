-- if there is a central public sentiment about economics prevailing in @entity5 right now , it seems to be this : we want to go back to our manufacturing roots			1
the heyday of manufacturing , the block - long plants that produce not just tangible goods , but big , heavy ones like cars , gave us economic stability once ; it can do it again			1
on wednesday , president @entity18 spoke at the @entity20 factory in @entity21 and said , " what 's happening in @entity23 can happen in other industries			1
what happens in @entity26 and @entity27 and @entity28 and @entity21 , that 's what we 've got to be shooting for , is to create opportunities for hardworking @entity31 to get in there and start making stuff again and sending it all over the world -- products stamped with three proud words : made in @entity5			1
" but as with most nostalgic visions , this one does n't reflect economic realities			1
first , it 's understandable why we have a romantic association with manufacturing			1
" factory nostalgia " is economically legitimate , because it harkens back to the period of the greatest growth in the @entity31 economy in history , basically 1950 to 1973			1
during that period , there was growth not just in production , but in real household incomes , which is something we have seen little of for the last 40 years			0
this gave rise to a burgeoning , powerful middle class , and more than that , a sense that all of @entity5 shared in the economic boom , with the assembly line tethering us like an anchor to shared prosperity			1
compare this image to the more recent service - based economy			1
the source of the common bond -- the assembly line -- is gone			0
instead , people are tied to their own education , their own human capital			0
because of that , they 're more stand - alone			1
and so since 1973 , we face this widening inequality , partly because our incomes are more tied to individuals , and individuals are different			0
there 's a huge variance across their abilities and educations , and incomes are tied directly to those things			0
and this situation creates the political tension we face in @entity5 ; consequently , we long for manufacturing because we associate that with the strength of the middle class			1
but can we go back to the assembly line ? to answer that , there is another important factor to keep in mind			0
the enormous growth from 1950 - 73 was n't entirely of our own making			1
it was partly due to our own initiative and education , but we also must remember that in 1950 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 were all leveled because of @entity108 we had no competition			2
today , not only are all those countries competing against us , but so are @entity111 , @entity112 and other countries in @entity5 and @entity114 -- countries with very large and growing populations			0
it 's not the same game , and in that sense , we 're naÃ ¯ ve to think we can repeat the ' 50s and ' 60s if we just pull our bootstraps up			0
the world was much different then			0
further , there 's a very important caveat to people who respond that we should just close our borders and make everything here			0
as an economic policy , that belief will only serve to hurt standards of living here and globally			2
there is a large body of evidence that shows that economic growth comes from three things : good geography , sound institutions and strong trade partnerships with the rest of the world			2
so , going back to closing the borders will only hurt us in the long run			0
despite the recent , well - publicized successes in @entity31 auto manufacturing , what is happening in the @entity31 economy is not the reversal of a trend toward declining manufacturing			1
rather , it 's a slowing down of the rate of loss of manufacturing , or almost a stabilization of the decline of manufacturing in this country			2
for the last 25 - 30 years , companies moved manufacturing to @entity111 where labor costs were considerably less and there existed an enormous consumer market			1
but the subsequent rapid per capita income growth in @entity111 has meant a rise in the relative price of their labor , so the cost differential is being alleviated			0
this cost differential is being further narrowed by @entity111 once again allowing its currency to gain in value compared to the @entity31 dollar			1
once that differential diminishes , the rate of manufacturing decline has to slow			2
however , this does not signal that " in - sourcing " or " re-shoring " is on the rise in @entity5			2
low - technology manufacturing is not anything we will ever get back to permanently			1
it 's just too costly to produce here , and even if @entity111 becomes less attractive , there 's still @entity187 , and much of @entity188 and @entity114			0
going forward for decades , we simply do n't have a comparative advantage in producing low - technology manufactured goods			2
but we can retain manufacturing strength in the high - technology goods , as long as we commit to providing the level of education that employees will need to meet the labor demand			1
there are those high - tech jobs such as the assembly of iphones and @entity202 that require proximity to component suppliers -- the chipmakers , the semiconductors , the circuitry -- which can and probably will continue to be performed in countries with less - skilled workforces			2
however , there are many tasks associated with such complex products -- research and development , for example -- that do n't require proximity to these suppliers and those provide jobs that @entity5 can gain			0
if manufacturing is to have a reinvigorated future in @entity5 , this is where the growth will be seen			2
but education is the key to the @entity31 being able to take advantage of this opportunity one of the biggest issues that i hear from managers and executives is that they need to hire workers , but ca n't find those who have the educational skills to be productive			1
this condition alone will lead to a permanently higher unemployment rate			0
we may not , in the foreseeable future , get down to 5 % unemployment because of the significant number of people who lack the skills for high - tech manufacturing jobs and the current underemployment and long duration of unemployment that is depreciating our workers ' skills			1
as a country , we face the risk that we will lose out in our ability to compete in manufacturing to @entity255 , @entity104 and others			2
so the nostalgia for our industrial past should be turned into a vision for a better way to educate our children			0
on a number of indices , we are in the bottom half of the richest 30 countries in terms of primary and secondary education performance for skills in math and reading comprehension			0
forty years ago , we were right near the top			0
some people are losing out on their opportunities for a better economic future even by age 4			0
we simply must return to our commitment to invest in human capital			0

@entity285 : theme of economic talk is desire to return to our factory roots
president @entity18 is stressing revival of manufacturing as a route to greater prosperity
@entity285 says the nostalgia is understandable but naive
he says the *golden* days of @entity31 manufacturing in the 1950 - 1970 era are gone
