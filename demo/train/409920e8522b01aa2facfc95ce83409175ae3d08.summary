-- after sweating out several weeks when news broke that his " late girlfriend " never existed -- and after sweating out the first day of the @entity5 draft without getting picked -- @entity6 can now sit back , knowing he has a home in professional football			1
the @entity9 drafted the @entity11 star and one - time tabloid fixture with the draft 's 38th pick , the sixth selection of the second round			0
the @entity18 runner - up talked during last season about his girlfriend @entity20 , a 22 - year - old @entity21 student whom he said died within hours of his beloved grandmother			1
the sports website @entity24 broke the story in january that @entity20 was n't real , and @entity6 subsequently insisted he 'd been the victim of a hoax			2
a @entity28 man named @entity29 later admitted on the " @entity30 " show that he 'd created the alter persona of @entity32 , even pretending to be a woman when he talked frequently to the @entity11 linebacker			0
some had speculated @entity6 , who led the @entity35 to an undefeated regular season before they lost in the national title game to @entity38 , could go in the first round			0
but every team with a pick passed			0
another player who slid down @entity5 draft boards , despite the predictions of many @entity5 prognosticators , was @entity47 quarterback @entity46			1
he was selected 39th , right after @entity6 , by the @entity48 -- who currently also have @entity50 and @entity51 on their roster			2
overall , the top of the @entity5 draft was n't dominated as it often is by big - name playmakers -- there were no running backs chosen in the first round			1
in fact , three of the first four picks were offensive lineman , starting with the @entity61 tapping @entity64 's @entity63 no. 1 overall .			0

@entity6 is picked 38th -- the 6th pick of the second round -- in the @entity5 draft
some had predicted the @entity18 runner - up would go in the first round
after news broke the girlfriend he 'd talked of was n't real , @entity6 said he was hoaxed
