-- @entity3 's capital endured a fourth consecutive night of rioting wednesday , with fires and clashes with authorities decreasing in the original flashpoint in the northern suburbs but increasing to the south , police said			1
rioters continued to set fires to vehicles and other structures in @entity13 and suburbs , and they pelted responding firefighters and police with rocks and other objects , @entity13 police press officer @entity11 said thursday			1
early media reports said the four days of riots , which started in the high - unemployment , low - income northern suburb of @entity28 on sunday , might have been triggered by last week 's shooting death of a man by police			1
but police said wednesday they were not sure of the cause			2
among wednesday 's incidents : rioters set fire to a restaurant and tried to burn two police stations , @entity11 said			1
the fires at the police stations were extinguished before the stations were destroyed			1
" in the southern parts of our city ... we 've seen an increase in violence , and most of our police officers and firemen who were working overnight have said that this has been very difficult , with so many incidents in so many places , " @entity11 said			1
he said 10 fires were set in the northern @entity13 area overnight , but he did n't have a number for the southern suburbs			1
the @entity57 , an @entity58 online newspaper , reported that @entity13 's fire service had responded to at least 75 incidents throughout the city by 2 a.m. thursday			2
police were so busy escorting firefighters , " we 've only had time to arrest one person " overnight -- a 16 - year - old girl on suspicion of preparing arson , @entity11 said			2
eight people were arrested in @entity28 on tuesday night , according to police			1
more than 100 vehicles were set on fire sunday night just in @entity28 , police said			1
another 29 were set on fire tuesday night in the wider district , they said			0
@entity28 is an area that has a lot of problems and a high crime rate , according to @entity11			2
tensions have been brewing since may 13 , when police shot dead a 69 - year - old @entity28 man who had a machete , the local newspaper said			1
on wednesday , @entity13 police spokesman @entity84 told @entity0 that authorities were n't sure why the riots began			1
" we have ... heard the reports that some are making the connection to the 69 - year - old man who was shot dead by police this past monday on may 13 in his apartment after he threatened police with a machete , and the officers attending felt their life was in danger and had to react , " @entity84 said			0
" but we do n't know for sure what is actually behind this			0
at this point , it is pure speculation			0
" it would be very unfortunate if we started hesitating to go in when serious incidents happen because of this			0
" the @entity57 also quoted a local youth leader as saying some police officers used racial slurs against residents sunday as the trouble flared			0
@entity84 said wednesday that police are investigating " possible use of inappropriate language or excessive use of force			0
" the disorder led @entity3 prime minister @entity119 to issue a statement tuesday appealing for calm			1
" we have had two nights of great worry , damage to property and a threatening mood in @entity28			2
there is a risk that it will continue			0
now everyone must help out to calm things down , " he said			0
" we have groups of young men who believe one should and can change our society through violence			0
we can not let violence govern			0
" @entity119 said the trouble reflects a broader problem in @entity3 society : more should be done to support education and help young people into work , he said			2
