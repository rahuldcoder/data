-- some travelers wondered friday whether they should be concerned about @entity3 's new @entity2 after a string of recent mechanical and other problems prompted a wave of negative publicity and an unusual federal safety review			1
troubles dating back just four months include reports of an oil leak , a fuel leak , engine cracks and a damaged cockpit window			2
this all follows a very difficult development history that included a series of production setbacks and other delays before the plane entered service in 2011			2
the @entity22 , which is responsible for air safety , launched a comprehensive examination on friday of the @entity2 's design as well as its manufacture and assembly			1
the electrical system is of particular interest to authorities following a fire this week aboard an empty 787 in @entity32			0
@entity34 - based businessman @entity33 said he 'll choose not to fly on the aircraft anytime soon			2
" i am wary of a plane model that has fire problems and leaks fuel , " said @entity33 , a project manager who takes more than 50 trips a year			0
" i think of it the same as a new car model : wait a year or two to get all the ' recalls ' sorted out			2
" on the other hand , travel industry leaders report passengers seem to be taking things in stride			1
@entity48 , president of @entity49 in @entity50 , @entity51 , said not one client has called with concerns about 787 safety issues			1
@entity55 , president of @entity56 , echoed a similar conclusion			0
" no one is steering clear of it at this point			0
no clients have called and asked to be rebooked			2
" @entity62 , who helps run a network of high - end travel agencies , says he has " zero trepidation about flying on this plane			1
" in fact , he said many clients have shifted their travel plans specifically so they can experience flying on the @entity2 wide body			1
more than 150 dreamliner flights occur daily , according to @entity3			1
@entity72 -- which has six 787s -- debuted the nation 's first domestic dreamliner routes last november with much fanfare			1
" we continue to have complete confidence in the 787 and the ability of @entity3 , " @entity72 said friday in a statement			1
the airline described the problems as " early operational issues			0
" @entity72 's @entity2 fleet travels routes primarily linking @entity85 and @entity86 and between @entity87 and @entity88			1
last week , the airline kicked off its first international 787 service between @entity88 and @entity91			0
other @entity93 carriers are in line to buy @entity95 , including @entity96			0
@entity97 has announced an order , but it 's not yet " firm			0
" worldwide , @entity3 has delivered 50 @entity95			1
several hundred are under order , making its success crucial for @entity3 , which had not designed a new commercial jetliner in years before unveiling the @entity2			1
the @entity22 review is " very unusual " because the agency signed off on the aircraft 's safety before it could fly commercially , said @entity107 , a former member of the @entity108			1
the safety board is the leading authority in the @entity93 on aircraft safety investigations and is looking into the @entity32 fire , which preliminarily has been linked to a auxiliary battery system			1
the @entity22 " just certified the airplane , so they 're going to go back and redo it			1
" does the @entity22 " not trust " their " own people ? " asked @entity107 , who 's also a former airline mechanic			1
@entity119 , president and ceo of the @entity121 , says the situation speaks to what 's going on inside the @entity22 itself			1
" we hope they take a look at their own processes internally to make sure that they 're up to date and on par with this new technologically advanced aircraft			1
" the twin - engine jetliner is heralded for its mostly carbon fiber construction , which reduces weight			0
its fuel saving possibilities , cutting edge technology , operational versatility and cabin appointments generated enormous interest from airlines , initially overseas			0
@entity3 , @entity145 and @entity22 officials said at a news conference on friday announcing the federal safety review that it was important to maintain public confidence in the @entity2			1
" there is a continued process that we always go through			0
so this is not unprecedented , " said @entity22 chief @entity153			1
but at @entity156 on friday , some passengers expressed skepticism in general about the nation 's airline regulatory safety net			2
" as a regulatory attorney , i know that regulatory agencies in this country do n't always do their job all that efficiently , " said @entity160 of @entity161 , @entity162			0
" so do i trust them to make sure the @entity2 is safe ? no. but will that stop me from flying if that 's the plane i 've got to get on to get where i 'm going ? no. " another traveler said his confidence in the system was high			1
" they 'll figure it out and get it all squared away , " said @entity172 of @entity173 , @entity162			0
@entity107 said every new airplane is going have " teething problems			0
" the manufacturers usually " get a handle on it quickly and fix it , " he said			0
a week @entity3 would like to forget the most recent @entity2 setbacks occurred friday			1
oil was discovered leaking from a generator on an engine at a @entity189 airport , and a crack appeared in a cockpit window of a plane en route from @entity91 to western @entity189 , a spokeswoman for @entity184 said			0
@entity184 was the @entity2 's launch , or first customer			1
on tuesday , a @entity197 flight bound for @entity91 aborted takeoff from @entity32 's @entity199 after a pilot on another airplane spotted the 787 leaking fuel			0
on monday , a maintenance worker discovered the electrical fire aboard an empty plane being prepared at a gate at @entity199 for a return trip to @entity189			0
in december , a @entity72 787 traveling from @entity85 to @entity87 , @entity208 , was diverted to @entity209 because of mechanical problems			1
a general inspection of all 787s in september turned up cracked engines on two planes			0
the cracked window and the leaky generator were not unusual issues , @entity184 said , and occur with other aircraft as well			2
this was the third time that a window cracked on an @entity222 , but the cockpit window has five layers , and friday 's crack , in a spider web pattern , appeared in the outer layer , @entity184 said			0
it did not endanger the flight			0
@entity2 's growing pains not unusual for new airplanes , experts say newer airplanes are safer than ever , @entity107 said			2
" we are flying more airplanes that have been engineered to be safer , " he said			2
" we almost ( never ) have material failures in airplanes anymore			0
" the @entity237 also had problems when it started flying in 2007 , but aviation expert @entity239 loves to fly on it			2
" it had cracks in the wing , which would be much more concerning to me " than the 787 reports , said @entity239 , a @entity241 aviation history professor			0
" they figured it out			0
pilots want to get to their destination alive as much as anybody , so they do n't mess around			0
" like the 787 , the @entity252 had a lot of issues when it started flying in 1970 , aviation consultant @entity251 said			2
and as with the former model , @entity3 will work through the current aircraft 's issues and move on , the company has said			1
two problems , two planes , two days " just like with anything that 's new , they kind of have to get the kinks out of it , " said airline passenger @entity262 , of @entity263 , @entity162			0
" so i would probably wait for a while until they get everything straight before i would fly			2
" @entity0 's @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report .			2

new : some fliers will wait before flying @entity2 ; others will keep flying
new : air safety group calls on @entity22 to examine its internal processes
travel industry leaders report zero concerns from clients
150 dreamliner flights happen daily , @entity3 says . @entity72 owns six aircraft
