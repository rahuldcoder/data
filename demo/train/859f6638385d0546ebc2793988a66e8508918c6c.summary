-- when did it become a crime to admit that you -- as a parent -- put yourself first ? sure , supermodel @entity6 's haters are ready to pounce no matter what the gorgeous , successful , wealthy wife of @entity9 quarterback @entity8 has to say			1
but the backlash surrounding her most recent comments about parenting -- how important it is as a mother to take care of yourself -- really got our attention because the issue is a powerful one in today 's parenting			1
" you know how they say on the plane you have to put the oxygen mask on first and then put it on your child ? " @entity6 told " the @entity30 " in an interview about why she believes motherhood is her most important job			1
" so i think it is the same , as a mum , to take care of myself			1
" " you can feel a bit guilty , " she said			2
" but if i put my oxygen mask on first , if i 'm feeling fulfilled and present and good about myself , then i 'm going to be a much more patient , loving , understanding mother and wife			1
you have to fill your glass so that everyone can drink from it			2
that 's how i feel			0
" why are we so quick to pass judgment the minute a mother professes to take time for herself ? is there something wrong with that ? admittedly , i have failed miserably when it comes to putting myself first ever since i became a mother more than eight years ago			1
now , though , i see that " me time " has a direct correlation not only with my own mental health but my ability to be a good , loving and patient mother			2
so i say , " you go girl , @entity6			1
" i only wish i had the same clarity years ago when my kids were small that she seems to have now			0
but removing @entity6 from the debate , why are we still as a society so quick to roll our eyes and say " bad mother " when a mom admits to making herself a priority ? " of course moms need to take care of themselves first , " said @entity71 , a mom of a 7 - year - old who writes for @entity74 and hosts a blog at @entity76			1
" i am an individual first , and i happen to be lucky enough to have the job of also being a mom			0
but yes , self - care is critical			2
" @entity71 said the @entity6 controversy brought to mind a recent article titled " how @entity85 parenting is killing the @entity86 , " about how parenting has almost become a religion in the @entity85			1
that , she said , is part of the problem			0
" i think motherhood in particular has been elevated by some elements of society to a religion full of zealots			0
" we are too often told by society that we , as mothers , must be " the martyr " and put everyone 's needs and desires before our own , said @entity104 , a mom of two small children and founder of the blog defining my happy			0
" we are supposed to go without for the sake of our family			0
it is implied that we have to give up our needs and passions to make room for others , " she said			0
" and unfortunately there are a lot of women who are guilted into believing that this is just the way it is			2
" but what makes us better parents , said @entity123 , a mom of two and founder of @entity126 , is taking time for ourselves			1
" it 's not selfish			0
it 's as much a gift to our children as it is to ourselves to make ourselves happy			0
" " if i 'm sad , depressed or not feeling good about myself , ( it ) reflects on my kids			0
my daughter can sense when i 'm unhappy and then she gets sad , " said @entity135 , mom of a 4 - year - old and founder of the blog @entity139			0
" why should n't a mom take time for herself ? so many women , like @entity143 , a mom of three , including 9 - year - old twins , and an editor and attorney , admitted learning the " hard way " that taking care of one 's self does not preclude taking care of the children and being good at a job			1
in fact , as @entity143 says , " it enhances both things			0
" " when i first had my twins and was working full time , i did not make time for myself at all , " said @entity143 , who also has her own blog about parenting			2
" i did not see friends , exercise , sleep or eat enough			0
it led to a back injury			0
" after physical therapy , yoga and realizing " more hours does not always mean better work , " @entity143 found herself much more centered when she had her third child six years later			0
@entity170 , editor of the motherhood anthology " @entity172 , " said , " we ca n't fully take care of others , if we 're not devoting time to ourselves , especially in a world that prescribes so many roles to women in particular -- worker , mother , wife , daughter , caregiver , homemaker , etc. " that said , @entity186 and other mothers across the country said that while @entity6 and other women of privilege have the means , which could include a " bevy of help , " to ensure their " me time , " that is not the case for most women today			1
" the average woman simply does n't have the same support in terms of childcare and also lacks the funds for various forms of self - care that @entity6 values , " said @entity186 , a mom of a 7 - year - old and host of the blog @entity201			1
" so , while the sentiment is lovely , the reality is very different for those not making a reported $ 128,000/day			2
" @entity212 , a mom of two girls , ages 18 and 22 , said she never took care of herself before her kids			2
as a single mom on a budget , there were plenty of times when she would forgo buying new clothes for herself , and sometimes eat less when food was scarce , so that her kids could be taken care of			2
" i do n't think @entity6 has ever been put in a position of being hungry ... or needing to clothe your kids for school but not having enough money to do it , so she would n't know that sacrifice of putting your kids first			1
" there is no question that hearing the " put yourself first " parenting advice from someone who has every resource on the planet to put herself first strikes people as out of touch , but regardless of the source , i still think it gets to a core problem of modern parenting			1
the debate reminded me of the firestorm of criticism that erupted after author @entity249 , in a 2005 column for the popular " @entity253 " feature in " the @entity252 , " said she loved her husband more than her children			0
can you imagine what the response would have been if @entity6 admitted loving @entity8 more ? what do you think people are so quick to criticize parents who put themselves first ? tell @entity262 on @entity263 or @entity264 on @entity265 .			1

@entity6 was criticized after saying she puts herself first in a recent interview
taking care of herself , @entity6 says , makes her a better mother and wife
many women across the country say the supermodel is 100 *%* right
some women find it hard to take parenting advice from a woman who makes $ 128,000 per day
