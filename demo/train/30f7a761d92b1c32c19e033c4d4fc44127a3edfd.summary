after he called them a " bunch of twats " during a @entity6 rant on friday			2

@entity2 is currently on international duty with @entity3 , preparing for the @entity32 qualifiers against @entity33 and @entity34			0
a short statement on the @entity4 's website read : " @entity1 's @entity2 has been charged by the @entity4 in relation to a @entity6 comment which was improper and / or brought the game into disrepute			1
" @entity2 has until 4pm on thursday 11 october 2012 to respond to the charge			0
" @entity14 was also tried in a criminal court after his altercation with @entity19 , the brother of @entity47 defender @entity45 , in which he admitted calling @entity19 " a f * * * * * * g black c * * *			0
" he claimed he was repeating words that @entity19 had said to him , asking his opponent if he thought he had been the subject of racial abuse			0
@entity14 was found not guilty in july but the @entity4 found him guilty on 27 september , using the " balance of probabilities " as its standard of proof as opposed to the " beyond reasonable doubt " ruling used in a criminal trial			2

" it went on : " @entity84 [ has ] considerable doubt as to whether the request to amend paragraph 4 of mr. @entity2 's statement , to include the word ' black ' , was based on mr. @entity2 's own personal recollections , or as a result of discussions that he had had with mr. @entity75			1
" @entity2 is also likely to face punishment from his club for the abusive tweet , with manager @entity95 stating his player had fallen foul of @entity1 's social media policy			1
