@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 condemned a @entity5 airstrike this week that a provincial official says killed women and children , in a statement that came just as @entity11 defense secretary @entity10 arrived thursday in @entity0 for talks			1
a provincial official has said civilians were among the dead in the airstrike , while the @entity5 - led @entity17 said initial reports revealed only two injuries			1
@entity17 is aware of the claims of civilian casualties and is looking into what took place , a spokesman for the coalition said			2
the @entity5 airstrike wednesday in eastern @entity1 's @entity30 province , along the volatile @entity27 border , is likely to strain already tense relations with the @entity11			1
in the statement , @entity3 said he was cutting short a trip to @entity34 , where he has been attending a summit			0
" @entity5 operations that inflict human and material losses to civilians can in no way be justifiable , acceptable and tolerable , " he said			0
@entity10 did not address the controversy over the airstrike in his public remarks while in @entity0			2
the @entity43 on thursday condemned " in the strongest terms " the deaths of civilians in @entity30 and in militant attacks in @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 a day earlier			1
together , the attacks killed 40 civilians , including 10 children , and injured at least 67 others , the @entity52 body said , in what was the single deadliest day for civilian deaths in 2012			1
while militant attacks have caused by far the greatest number of civilian casualties in @entity1 , its statement said , " @entity43 has also repeatedly expressed concern that aerial operations have resulted in more civilian deaths and injuries than any other tactic used by pro-government forces since the present armed conflict began			2
" @entity70 , a member of @entity1 parliament from @entity30 province , told @entity2 he believed four insurgents also were killed in the @entity5 airstrike in the @entity75 district of @entity30			1
he said the bodies of 18 civilians , including women and children , had been brought to the provincial capital , @entity81 , but that the bodies of the four insurgents had been taken elsewhere			1
an investigation team has gone to the area to determine how many militants were in the building hit in the airstrike , said @entity70			0
he said insurgents had fired on a @entity11 military convoy from the house			2
@entity10 : @entity11 running out of patience with @entity27 on militant havens the allegations of civilian casualties came ahead of discussions between @entity10 and @entity97 gen. @entity96 , commander of @entity17 troops , and @entity1 defense minister gen. @entity100			1
the training of @entity1 security forces was likely to be high on the list of discussion topics			2
with @entity11 troops due to withdraw from @entity1 by the end of 2014 under a timetable announced by president @entity109 , the @entity11 military is beefing up its training of @entity1 forces			1
at that time , security duties will be fully turned over to the @entity1 government , although some @entity11 forces will remain in @entity1 beyond 2014 as military advisers			1
the latest allegations of civilian casualties also come at a critical time for the @entity11			2
while @entity11 military and political officials have said publicly that @entity1 will be ready to take over security of its country by the time @entity5 troops depart , critics have said there are questions about whether @entity1 forces can stand on their own			1
violence has increased in recent weeks , coinciding with the start of the @entity130 's summer fighting season			0
on what was his fourth visit to @entity1 , @entity10 praised the efforts of @entity11 forces , saying that thanks to them , a " turning point " had been reached after 10 years of war			1
he acknowledged that there had been an " uptick in violence , " but said that was because @entity17 forces had taken the fight to the @entity130			2
" we 've been able to put this country in the right direction			0
the reality is we have weakened the @entity130 , " the defense secretary told an audience of @entity11 troops			1
but while @entity1 forces are gaining in strength and capability , he said , international forces still have work to do			0
" this is still not going to be an easy fight			0
we still have a lot of challenges to confront			0
we have a resilient enemy that will use any tactic they can to come at us			0
" @entity10 said that @entity17 forces would continue to support @entity1 beyond the agreed troop drawdown , with an " enduring presence " past 2014 , and that the goal was to ensure a safer future for the @entity11 as well as for the @entity1 people			1
asked what message @entity11 troops should give to @entity1 commanders concerned about what would follow the transition to @entity1 control , @entity10 said : " we are not going anyplace			1
we are committed to an @entity1 ... that can secure and govern itself			0
" we have lost a lot of people in battle , and we continue to lose people			0
one thing we have to make damn sure of is that those lives were not lost in vain			0
" @entity10 's brief trip to @entity0 did not include a meeting with @entity3 , who was en route back to @entity1 at the time the @entity11 defense secretary was wrapping up his trip			1
the last meeting between the two , in march , came on the heels of allegations that a @entity11 soldier left his base in southern @entity47 province and went on a shooting spree in two villages that left 17 people dead			0
at the time , @entity3 called the shootings a cruel act against the people of @entity1 , and told @entity10 that @entity1 have lost trust in international forces			2
the shooting spree followed revelations that @entity11 troops inadvertently burned copies of the quran and other @entity207 religious materials , which sparked massive , violent protests			0
military officials said the materials had been seized from @entity1 prisoners because they contained extremist messages			0
@entity2 's @entity213 and @entity214 contributed to this report .			0
