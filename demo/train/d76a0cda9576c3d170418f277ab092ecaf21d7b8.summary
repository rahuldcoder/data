-- looking for the best time of the year to get a promotion ? according to data collected and analyzed by @entity4 , january , june and july are the most popular months for @entity6 workers to receive promotions			1
globally , january , july and september are the top three			1
" it is not surprising that promotions tend to occur around these times , " says @entity9 , a career coach and author of " the @entity13 professional 's @entity11			1
" " in the @entity6 , promotions usually happen around new budget cycles and after holidays			1
january represents the start of a new calendar year and when performance evaluations are typically conducted			2
some companies begin their new budget cycles in june or july , thus promotions occur in these months			1
" the worldwide tendency to promote in january can likewise be attributed to the turning of the calendar , marking a time of new beginnings			2
but while promotions in june and july in @entity6 may be due primarily to mid-year evaluations and fiscal calendars , many other countries have a special consideration			1
" july represents the time before much of the world takes the month of august off for holiday , so decisions are made prior to vacation			2
and september is when they return , " @entity9 notes			1
other good times for promotions the @entity4 study also revealed that while certain months had a higher percentage of promotions compared to others , advancement is becoming less concentrated			1
for example , during the 1990s , 22 percent of promotions occurred in january , but in the most recent decade that figure decreased to 16 percent			1
" there are two types of promotions to consider			2
one is a promotion that fills a vacancy in a hierarchy			1
this can occur at any time that the vacancy occurs			2
for example , an editor retires and someone is promoted to fill the position , " says @entity59 , a professor in the management department at @entity62 's @entity61 in @entity63 , @entity64 , and a former vice president of human resources at @entity66 in @entity67			1
" the other type of promotion is a step up in a hierarchy of jobs , such as a promotion from buyer to senior buyer			1
while it varies by company or industry , this usually occurs on a schedule that reflects an individual 's performance evaluation period			0
frequently , this would coincide with the end of a business performance period such as a fiscal year			0
" besides someone 's departure opening up opportunities for advancement , other situations can increase the odds for promotion at any time of the year			0
" strike when the iron is hot , " @entity9 says			1
" when you introduce a new idea that will increase productivity , save money or generate revenue , you 're golden			0
when you 've successfully completed a special project , you 've got their attention			0
ask what new projects you can take on and how those projects will position you for expanded responsibilities			0
" likewise , @entity9 notes that promotions often happen when there 's a spike in business because there will be a focus on adding headcount to manage the expanded activity			1
but are promotions out of the question when a company is having difficulty ? " obviously , when times are tough as they are in most businesses today , you need to be sensitive to the needs of the business in asking about promotions , " @entity59 says			2
" do keep in mind , however , that tough times also present opportunities to shine			0
as people leave or are even laid off , showing a willingness to step up and take on additional responsibilities shows that you care about the organization			2
" getting noticed regardless of the season , experts agree that there are things you can do throughout the year to make yourself more " promotable " including : getting the extra training or experience needed for the position you desire			0
letting managers know that you are interested in advancement			0
asking superiors what steps they recommend to help prepare for a promotion			0
looking at the big picture to see how your actions help your manager get her job done well			0
making others aware of your contributions -- without going overboard or constantly bragging			0
above all , it is critical that you are performing up to par on your current job			0
as @entity59 notes , " no one is going to be impressed with someone who is focusing so much on the next job that he is n't really doing the one he has well			0
