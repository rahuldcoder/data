-- in an otherworldly landscape , with controllers in hand , players must conquer the @entity5 in order to release a powerful demigod			0
no , this is n't " @entity9			0
" it 's " @entity11			0
" and with a playlist steeped in monster riffs and a quest mode that winds through scenes populated with the dungeons and dragons of fantasy lore , it might just expose heavy metal 's darkest secret			1
" the ultimate trick that musicians played on the world is that they were cool , " said @entity22 , whose band @entity23 ( from his @entity25 cartoon " @entity26 " ) lent the song " bloodlines " to " @entity11 : warriors of @entity33			1
" " they 're not cool			0
they all love @entity37 , ' @entity38 ' and @entity39			1
everybody from @entity42 to @entity43 , they are all nerds			2
" the game , released september 28 and available on @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 , likes @entity39 , too			1
it includes all seven parts of the @entity54 progressive rock band 's " 2112 " suite and even weaves the legendary rockers into the fabric of the game			1
the members of @entity39 worked on the " 2112 " game sequence , helping create in - game venues based on scenes from the liner notes of their original album			1
the band gave suggestions for imagery and recorded voice - overs for the scenes , said @entity69 , " @entity73 " project leader for game creator @entity71			1
he said the story of " 2112 " parallels the story in the game			2
" the songs tell the story of a man who discovers a guitar , something he has never been exposed to , as the world he lives in is very orwellian and controlling , " @entity69 said			0
" in the game , the player is in search of the @entity88 's legendary guitar as it is the source of his power			0
" @entity22 acknowledges that including 21 minutes worth of @entity39 on a game known for mainstream appeal is a nod toward rock 's inner nerd			1
" absolutely ! " he said			0
" without a doubt , yeah ! oh man , but they picked the right @entity39			1
that 's certainly my favorite , and it 's got amazing guitar moments , too			0
" it also has what @entity22 calls the nerdiest thing of all in music : odd time signatures , which could mean difficult play in @entity73			1
" when people start counting odd times like 7/4 instead of 4/4 , [ they 're trying to ] be different and make a new groove , and that is a nerdy , nerdy thing			0
but @entity39 gets away with it because they 're good , " said @entity22			1
@entity71 worked closely with other artists to create the ultimate metal quest mode			1
@entity119 's @entity118 -- whom @entity22 considers one of the world 's best rhythm guitarists -- wrote and recorded " @entity125 " for the finale of the game			1
" the game ends with an epic battle between the @entity128 raging on an apocalyptic landscape , so we wanted a track that would completely shred , " @entity69 said			0
additionally , @entity132 , the " demon " bassist of iconic rock band @entity133 , is the narrator of the game 's quest mode and makes a cameo as the @entity128			1
other musicians who metalheads and rock guitar enthusiasts are sure to geek out to include @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity43 , @entity142 and @entity143			2
@entity69 said " @entity73 " songs were selected chiefly on their playability			2
" a good song for ' @entity11 ' would have a memorable riff but not feel repetitive			0
there would be a good amount of chord changes and , ideally , a fun guitar solo to add to the challenge , " he said			0
but being a good guitar player does n't necessarily make you a good " @entity11 " player			0
@entity156 , @entity22 's bandmate in the live , touring version of @entity23 , said he thought @entity23 songs were easier to play on an actual guitar			1
" bloodlines " is @entity23 's third song on a " @entity11 " game			0
@entity22 had to disagree with his friend			2
" i said , ' nah , that 's not true			0
there 's 11 - year - olds out there who can just shred through [ @entity23 songs ] " @entity167 " and " laser - cannon @entity165			2
" ' " those 11 - year olds who play " @entity73 " are about to discover some of the music that helped build @entity22 's career as a musician and cartoon producer			1
@entity22 's current cartoon project , " @entity26 , " follows a fictional metal band , @entity23 , who have become so popular that they influence world economies			1
" one of my favorite things about ' @entity11 ' is you 're turning a whole generation on to music that would n't , i think , have discovered it any other way , " @entity22 said			2
" because in order to know about metal , you 've either got to have a cool older sibling or a dude down the street who just knows what 's up			2
some people do n't have either of those things			0
some people have a really uncool older sibling who listens to @entity199 or some kind of dance or club or trance , and they 're never going to learn about cool guitar stuff or @entity205 or any of that stuff			0
" but now that they have ' @entity11 ' in their life , they can learn about @entity208			0
" a sad omission on " @entity11 's " part from its sixth offering , said @entity22 , was that of lightening - fast guitarist @entity215			1
@entity215 , a @entity216 guitarist , is known for his classical approach to metal music , as well as his fantasy - laden album covers and music videos			1
" @entity215 , of course is the king			0
that should be on ' @entity11 , ' because it would just be unplayable , " @entity22 said			2
" he did [ a video ] with a wizard , a dragon and him in really high - waisted spandex pants and sgt. @entity229 's jacket flipping his stratocaster around			2
pretty awesome -- what rock ' n ' roll is built for			0

" @entity73 " sets a metal playlist to a fantasy - driven quest play mode
@entity22 says metal musicians are nerds
@entity239 to the quest play mode is the entire " 2112 " rock suite from @entity39
