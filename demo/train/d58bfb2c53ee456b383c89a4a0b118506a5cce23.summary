@entity0 -- a @entity3 committee approved legislation on tuesday that would expand background checks covering all @entity7 firearms sales , part of a federal gun - control push prompted by december 's school massacre in @entity11			1
the @entity13 decision by a party - line vote of 10 - 8 cleared the way for the @entity17 - crafted background check measure to be debated and put to a vote in the full @entity3			1
less clear is the fate of a proposed ban on military assault rifles proposed by sen. @entity22 , a @entity24 @entity23			1
the panel put off a vote on that plan , but is expected to revisit it as early as thursday			1
there is little expectation @entity22 's proposal , which president @entity32 backs along with expanded background checks and other steps , will win congressional approval due mainly to stiff opposition from lawmakers aligned with the politically potent @entity38			1
the background check proposal by sen. @entity40 , a @entity41 @entity23 , is also expected to face tough opposition once the full @entity3 takes it up			1
@entity44 town shoots down requirement for gun in every household it is among the first gun - control proposals to begin moving through @entity50 since the school massacre in @entity52 , @entity11 , by a lone gunman armed with an assault weapon jolted the nation and renewed debate on the issue			1
a bipartisan effort in the @entity3 in recent weeks to put together background check legislation crumbled prior to the committee vote			1
one sticking point concerned checks involving private sales and what records would be maintained once guns are purchased			0
@entity40 's bill would mandate background checks for all gun sales , including private transactions			2
it would also require increased cooperation by states with the @entity74 's @entity73 ( @entity73 ) and would prohibit people deemed by the courts as unfit to own guns from obtaining them			0
in opposing @entity40 's measure , sen. @entity79 disputed whether tougher background check laws would prevent criminals from obtaining a gun			1
" obviously , criminals do get guns			0
they obtain them because they do not comply with background checks , " the @entity87 @entity86 said			2
" supporters of this bill contend that if we only make background checks universal , criminals will not get guns			2
but criminals do not comply with existing background check laws			1
" new law lets @entity100 schools arm teachers , volunteers @entity40 took issue with @entity79 's comments			0
" on terrorism , on robbery , on murder , on money laundering , we never see the argument that we should n't have laws because the bad people will get around them anyway , " a visibly frustrated @entity40 said			0
" only on this issue and it makes no sense			0
" whether the measure approved by the committee on tuesday can garner enough support in the @entity3 remains to be seen			0
finding @entity86 support has been tough			0
for weeks , @entity40 was in talks with @entity121 @entity120 sen. @entity120 in an attempt to find agreement across the aisle			0
hours before the committee took up the issue last week , those talks fell apart			0
lawmakers once supportive of @entity40 's bipartisan effort , including sen. @entity129 , an @entity130 @entity86 , and sen. @entity131 , a @entity132 @entity23 , quickly distanced themselves from it when it became clear the legislation was n't what they envisioned			2
the @entity38 has said increased checks are nothing more than an attempt to create a national gun registry , a move the group vehemently opposes			2
@entity144 town mulls mandatory gun ownership " criminals wo n't participate in a ' universal ' system			2
they 'll always steal or get their guns and everything else they want on the black market			0
reasonable people know that criminals will never be part of the ' universe , ' " @entity38 executive vice president @entity151 said on the group 's website			0
@entity40 said in a statement following the committee meeting that the issue of background checks remains the political " sweet spot " on gun control and promised continued efforts to find bipartisan support			1
a second measure was approved on tuesday by the panel that would establish a framework for the @entity169 to set safety guidelines aimed at protecting schools from gun violence			1
the bill , proposed by @entity174 , @entity175 , a @entity24 @entity23 , was approved 14 - 4 with bipartisan support			1
before the committee vote sen. @entity177 , a @entity178 @entity86 , said he hoped for increased discussion on funding armed security officers in schools but voted in favor of the measure promising to negotiate details when it reaches the @entity3 floor			0
last week , the @entity3 panel also approved a bill that would toughen laws on gun trafficking and straw purchases of firearms			2
