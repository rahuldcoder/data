@entity0 -- in a classic " @entity4 " sketch , @entity2 plays a music producer with just one message for his bands : " more cowbell ! i got ta have more cowbell ! " sometimes you wonder if @entity2 is producing this year 's election , too			2
in @entity12 , the @entity11 has nominated its least ideological candidate since @entity14			1
at every turn , the party has demanded , " more ideology ! i got ta have more ideology ! " with the selection of @entity20 as his running mate , @entity12 has now acceded to that wish			1
the least ideological @entity11 candidate since 1968 has committed himself to the most ideological @entity11 program since 1964			2
the first battle in every election is the battle to decide what the election is about			0
what 's the question voters must answer ? @entity12 's choice of @entity20 energizes two sides in 1992 , for example , @entity11 wanted the election to be about @entity38 's steady leadership in a dangerous world : the end of the @entity41 and victory in the @entity43			1
@entity25 countered , " it 's the economy , stupid ! " this year , an incumbent even more embattled than @entity38 has his own preferred election theme			2
he does n't want to debate his own record , which is pretty dismal			0
he wants to debate the record of the congressional @entity11 elected in 2010 , a bunch radically less popular even than the president himself			0
you 'd imagine that @entity12 's job was to refuse the @entity25 invitation , to choose his own ground for the election , and to keep his distance from the congressional @entity11			1
you 'd imagine , but you 'd be wrong			0
@entity12 has instead chosen to bolt himself to the @entity58 republicans			2
he has chosen as his running mate @entity20 , the @entity60 -- not their formal leader , but their intellectual leader , the person who set their agenda			1
he has effectively adopted @entity20 's agenda as his own : big immediate cuts in spending , a dramatic cut in the top rate of income tax to 28 % and a bold reform of @entity74 for those 55 and under			1
@entity76 's message in 2012 : " forget the economy			1
it 's @entity74 , stupid ! " the @entity81 response ? " we agree			1
" @entity83 : why @entity20 ? the @entity84 will tell you that fixing @entity74 is crucial to their plans for economic growth			1
by assuring markets that @entity74 costs will grow more slowly after 2023 , a @entity74 fix -- it 's argued -- will ignite job creation in 2013			1
in the meantime , federal spending cuts and upper - income tax cuts will restore business confidence			2
will voters accept this argument ? possibly , although relatively few economists will do so			0
most economists would draw a distinction between the government 's fiscal problems over the medium term and the economy 's problems in the near term			1
the economy 's near - term problems can be traced to the housing crisis			1
@entity112 assumed crushing levels of debt in the 2000s to buy expensive homes , homes they assumed would continue to rise in price forever			0
in 2007 , household debt relative to income peaked at the highest level since 1928			0
) when the housing market crashed , consumers were stranded with unsustainable debts , and until those debts are reduced , consumers will drastically cut back their spending			2
as consumers cut back , businesses lose revenue			0
as businesses lose revenue , they fire employees			0
as employees lose their jobs , their purchasing power is reduced			0
as purchasing power is lost throughout the economy , housing prices tumble again			0
opinion : is @entity20 for or against @entity140 ? since 2008 , the debt burden on households has declined somewhat , partly because of increased saving , mostly because of mortgage default			2
but household debts have declined nowhere near enough , and the pace of household debt reduction is slowing			0
the result : slow recovery of the private economy , weak consumer demand , paltry job growth -- considerably offset by continuing job shrinkage in the public sector			0
@entity20 's various plans and road maps contain many interesting elements for the reduction of government in the decades ahead			1
they do not respond to the most immediate and urgent problem : prolonged mass unemployment caused by heavy household debt			0
why not ? there 's why the ideology makes itself felt			0
conservatives ardently believe that big future deficits are the cause of today 's unemployment			2
and they do n't want to hear different			0
when naysayers worry that the @entity12 campaign has over-indulged the ideology , the answer quickly comes : " well , @entity179 was ideological in 1980 -- and he still won			1
why ca n't @entity12 do the same , especially since the economy is even worse now than it was then ? " opinion : @entity20 will shift the campaign dynamic fair answer			1
here 's the difference : although @entity179 was a highly ideological candidate , he did not run a highly ideological campaign			1
quite the contrary ! precisely because party conservatives trusted @entity179 's ideological commitment , they allowed him space to move to the center			1
seeking the @entity11 nomination in 1976 , @entity179 had pledged large immediate cuts in federal spending ( $ 90 billion , at a time when that was a lot of money )			0
in 1980 , @entity179 emphasized an easier - to - swallow message of tax cuts , not spending cuts -- and indeed promised that he 'd protect the @entity74 program he 'd opposed when it was created in the mid- 1960s			1
no such leeway for @entity12			2
he has been constrained first to endorse @entity20 's budget plan ( which he did in december 2011 after months of attempted evasion ) , to endorse a cut in the top rate of income tax to 28 % ( march 2012 ) , and now finally to choose @entity20 himself as his running mate			1
no leeway -- and now no exit			0
conservatives exult that the @entity11 will now offer the country " a choice , not a referendum			0
" that phrase does not make a lot of sense			0
( what is more of a choice than a referendum ? ) but there 's good reason why conservatives say it			2
they are looking for a rephrasing of the slogan uppermost in their minds : " a choice not an echo " -- the title of the best - selling manifesto that helped persuade @entity11 to follow @entity235 to disaster			0
opinion : why @entity20 pick wo n't help @entity12 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			1

@entity241 : conservatives have pushed for a more ideological approach to the campaign
he says that in @entity20 , conservatives get their wish but it may come back to haunt them
by picking a running mate with a plan to change @entity74 , @entity12 gives @entity76 an issue
@entity255 : @entity20 's long - term fiscal fix does nothing to deal with the causes of *current* economic *slowdown*
