-- last week , my op - ed in favor of cannabis legalization ran on @entity0			1
this week marks three years since i first wrote that marijuana should be legal			1
i 'm amazed at how the debate has changed in just a few years			2
i was inundated with messages from readers , and was humbled by some of them			2
here 's one from a @entity11 pastor : " i have seen firsthand the heartache caused by @entity14 's prohibition against marijuana			1
i have visited young men in prison , who i knew in my heart should not be there ... it is time for us to speak out and tell the truth about marijuana ... " but so many are afraid to speak out because they fear being labeled ' pro-drugs ' ... i pray daily that @entity25 will end this dreadful ' war			0
' " the overwhelmingly positive comments posted on @entity0 , especially from those who do n't use marijuana , show that more mainstream @entity14 are willing to voice their pro-legalization opinions			1
informed adults are challenging old dogmas , and they worry less about the folly of " @entity34 " than refined sugar 's role in shortening their children 's lives			1
given the thousands of thoughtful comments in the past week , i 'd like to address several of the most important themes readers have discussed : @entity42 writes : " a couple of years ago , comments for articles like this were much more negative			0
i believe that the coming of the information age has played a major role in the widely recognized shift in public opinion on legalization			0
today 's readers are increasingly able to judge facts for themselves by consulting readily available and well - referenced scientific sources			1
@entity57 is in favor of " decriminalizing [ pot ] and taxing it			1
" there is often confusion between the terms decriminalization and legalization , though the distinction is critical			0
full legalization would empower federal , state and local governments to regulate and tax the cannabis trade			1
regulation facilitates control and safety , and government debt can be reduced with taxes raised from marijuana sales			0
but if we merely decriminalize marijuana , then it continues to be at least nominally illegal			0
possession could get you the equivalent of a parking ticket , and those involved in the drug trade might still receive more severe punishment			0
not only would this burden law enforcement , but the cannabis economy would remain unregulated and untaxed			0
opinion : marijuana use is too risky a choice @entity90 , who declares himself to be " pro-legalization , but anti-use , " writes : " my life experiences growing up taught me that my friends who smoked pot in grade school , high school and / or college suffered for it			1
" make no mistake : marijuana is bad for kids , although pot 's potential harm to children is rather more subtle than that of alcohol , which can cause life - threatening physical addiction or fatal poisoning			1
studies suggest that repeated marijuana use in adolescents can cause cognitive impairment and chronically low motivation , setting teens on a path of underachievement			0
but if cannabis is legalized , the tax revenues it brings in can be used to fund better drug education in schools			1
we must start teaching our children early , highlighting the nuanced but significant risks to underage users and avoiding the typical hyperbole that teens know they can safely ignore			1
even with the legalization of marijuana , anyone over 21 should be prosecuted for providing cannabis to anyone under 21			0
and remember : drug dealers do n't check ids , but liquor store cashiers do			0
given that drug dealers are n't going away , who would you rather have as the retailer of marijuana ? @entity142 , who is also explicitly pro-legalization , asserts : " @entity144 cause hallucinations			0
" when it comes to marijuana 's role in psychiatric disorders , the medical literature and my clinical experience are ambiguous			1
there 's a kind of chicken and egg problem with scientific studies , and they often contradict one another			1
cannabis use does correlate with mental illness , but so does poor hygiene			0
some users experience transient , mild paranoia when ingesting pot , which generally leads them to simply stop using it			1
many of my patients with anxiety and depression have found that frequent use of cannabis makes their condition worse			0
a few report that it helps them , at least subjectively			0
regardless , alcohol is a much stronger depressant than pot. as for thought disorders like schizophrenia , evidence suggests that a very large dose of pot can make a healthy person briefly lose touch with reality , and even modest doses may trigger a more serious psychotic episode in some people who are already ill or likely to become ill. while infrequent among pot users , this is of little consolation if you are the unlucky person for whom cannabis is a match to the fuel of underlying mental illness			1
on the other hand , it hardly warrants universal pot prohibition any more than the existence of peanut allergies would justify a ban on legumes			1
@entity205 asks : " is there any evidence regarding the effect on driving while stoned from pot ? " studies have shown that moderate to severe intoxication with marijuana does indeed increase a driver 's accident risk			1
but look deeper and you 'll find that this risk is similar to that of drivers with a blood alcohol level of 0.05 % , which happens to be well below the federally mandated legal limit of 0.08 %			2
so once again , pot may not be good , but alcohol is worse			2
@entity225 requests : " please do n't call it ' weed			0
' it has lots of uses			0
" baby boomers call it " pot , " and their kids call it " weed			2
" the most common and controversial term is derived from the @entity238 vernacular " marihuana			0
" until the 1930s , @entity241 speakers preferred the scientifically accurate name " cannabis			0
" but those @entity14 who sought to ban the drug in the 1930s favored the previously little known and foreign - sounding term " marijuana , " which might and apparently did stir racial passions among whites			2
@entity250 asserts : " the main reason it should be legal is ... as a 38 - year - old white man in a white collar job i will never be stopped , questioned or arrested for marijuana possession ever ! " after 75 years , have n't our laws against marijuana shed their racist past ? apparently not			1
although african - americans are 25 % more likely to use marijuana than white @entity14 , they are 300 % more likely to be arrested for it			2
a criminal record greatly limits one 's opportunities for success in life			2
the racial divide widens , and racial tensions grow			0
this , dear readers , is the enduring legacy of pot prohibition			2
and finally , @entity274 comments that " cannabis [ is ] the correct term for marijuana			0
" i 'm afraid we may be stuck with the contentious word " marijuana , " but it provides a useful reminder of one way in which @entity14 society was long ago manipulated into the prohibition of a plant that caused a mild euphoria in most people who tried it and a severe paranoia in many who did n't			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity295 .			1
