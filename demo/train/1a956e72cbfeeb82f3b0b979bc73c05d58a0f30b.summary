-- step into any major urban center across @entity2 and you 'll have no problem accessing your favorite websites , catching the latest news online or sending your friends an e-mail			1
step outside the city , however , and you 'll soon have to say goodbye to the world ( wide web )			2

" there is just no connectivity whatsoever , " says @entity22 , a professor at the @entity23 , located outside the city of @entity25			2
" from the area where i am , " explains @entity22 , " the nearest internet @entity31 will be 30 kilometers ( away ) -- there are even some people who travel 50 kilometers or so to get to the nearest internet facility			2
" but all this could soon change			0
@entity17 has been selected by @entity35 for the latest trial of an initiative using white spaces technology -- the unused channels in the broadcast tv spectrum -- aiming to bring broadband with speeds of up to 2 mb per second to under - served rural communities			1
the 12 - month pilot project , which will become operational in october , will use the relatively new technology and solar - powered base stations to get five secondary schools in the province online -- all located within 10 kilometers of the university , which is used as the project 's hub			2
@entity22 says the pilot will benefit both pupils and teachers			0
" their lives are going to be made easier , " he says			0
" some of the schools in the area have a shortage in terms of materials , " adds the professor			0
" so it will definitely benefit the learners in those schools and expose them to computer usage			0
" unused spectrum but what is this experimental technology and how does it work ? put simply , tv white spaces refers to the unused frequencies that are lying idle following the migration of tv broadcast from analogue to digital -- previously , these were kept clear to avoid interference with neighboring channels			1
the low - signal frequencies , from around 400 megahertz to about 800 megahertz , can penetrate walls and other obstacles more easily than the traditional broadband technologies			1
they can also transfer data traveling longer distances before they need to be reboosted , up to 10 kilometers , which means that fewer towers or base stations are needed to cover a wider area			0

@entity102 @entity35 , which has been researching tv white spaces for 12 years , has so far deployed the technology in a number of locations -- from the @entity107 and @entity108 to emerging markets in @entity110			1
but it 's @entity2 , a continent beset by connectivity and infrastructure challenges , where the company sees the biggest potential			1
the tech giant first brought white spaces to @entity2 last february when it launched a trial delivering broadband access to remote villages in @entity121 's @entity120			1
this was followed by a second pilot in an urban environment in may , bringing wireless broadband access to students at the @entity127 in @entity128 , before the launch of the third trial in @entity2			1
read this : teen plans ' hacker school ' in @entity121 @entity134 , general manager of @entity35 's @entity2 initiatives , says the continent is an ideal location for the deployment of white spaces			1
he cites a number of reasons			0
" the first one is the distance ; the ability to cover ground with the least amount of effort , " says @entity134			0
" think about it , with one tower , with one broadcast station , if you go 10 kilometers either direction you 're creating ... a very big patch of land which we 're essentially covering with one antenna			2
" this brings infrastructure costs significantly down , says @entity134 , something that is key in the efforts to speed up @entity162 adoption in @entity2 and help its economic development			1
" we need to do an innovative approach to get people online , " he says			0
" we can not follow traditional methods where perhaps the coverage increases by 1,000 yards every week or so -- we have to go much faster than that ... because of the very rapid growth of @entity2 's workforce and the desperate need to get skills into the population			2
" putting the technology to test @entity35 is not the only company rolling out white spaces projects in @entity2			1
in late march , @entity179 launched a similar pilot project bringing wireless broadband to 10 schools in @entity183 , @entity2			1
read this : why tech innovators are @entity2 's future @entity35 says it plans to use its pilots , part of its @entity189 , to convince governments to make the needed legal and regulatory changes that would allow for the deployment of the technology across the continent			1
but getting the many regulatory bodies on board could be a significant challenge for a wider roll out			2
consultations over white space schemes in other countries have raised concerns that the technology could interfere with television broadcasts or services using similar frequencies , but @entity35 believes that will not be a problem			1
" we 've arrived at a point where we 've not only improved the technology but also proved that there is no interference as television users continue to see and have the quality they desire , " says de @entity134			2
" we 're also able to deliver what is a hugely valuable service because in @entity2 ( lack of access ) is probably the single biggest constraint to economic development , skills acquisition and jobs creation			2
" excitement @entity223 is director of research at the @entity226 's @entity225			0
while he welcomes the initiative to provide rural @entity229 schools with internet access , he cautions that many schools have other needs			1
" it 's great that they 're experimenting and trying this but other things need to be taken into account , " he says			0
" for example , some schools might not have electricity , toilets , teachers , textbooks			0
connecting people is a prerequisite for some of the things you might want to happen -- but the problem is when people think that 's enough			0
" @entity251 says @entity35 is now in discussions with governments , multilateral organizations and local service providers about rolling out white spaces in about 10 @entity229 countries			1
" we 're now getting into the stage where the pilot stages are over and we 're starting to deploy commercially viable deployments , " he says			0
back in @entity17 , @entity22 says the schools ca n't wait for the project to begin			0
" there is excitement , everyone is eagerly waiting to see how this is going to happen , " he says			0
" if the pilot works then i 'm sure we will increase ( the number of schools ) , " adds @entity22			0
" we 're looking at education for a start and i think later health will follow , business will follow -- everyone is looking to participate in in this			0

@entity35 trialing tv ' white spaces ' to bring broadband to rural @entity2

the company has already launched trials in @entity121 and @entity128
@entity35 plans to roll out the technology to several other @entity229 countries
