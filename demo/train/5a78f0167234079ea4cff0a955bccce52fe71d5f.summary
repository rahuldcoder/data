-- it was both painful and strange for @entity2 and his wife , @entity3 , as they stared across the @entity5			0
the ocean still held the bodies of their daughter and son - in - law , three months after the crash of @entity12			1
that day in 2009 , standing along the shoreline of @entity15 's festive @entity14 was as close as the @entity16 could come to the spot hundreds of miles offshore where 24 - year - old @entity19 and @entity20 , 34 , had taken their last breaths			1
" you are crying , you are praying , you are thinking about your child , while beside you , you can hear people laughing and playing , " said @entity2 on the phone wednesday from his home outside @entity24			0
" it was not a good country for grieving -- for crying			0
" the @entity16 ' daughter and her flight attendant husband were among the 228 victims aboard the @entity34 which disappeared from radar between @entity36 and @entity37 en route from @entity39 to @entity24			1
in the two years since the crash , the @entity16 say they 've been haunted by the pain of not knowing why the plane went down			2
map of @entity12 's route it was only this month that searchers were able to find the aircraft 's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder -- the so - called black boxes -- in mountainous terrain under 13,000 feet of ocean			1
the first information from that data is expected to be made public on friday			2
investigators will be able to id bodies , official says but if data from those devices had been uplinked from the plane to satellites immediately before the crash , would hundreds of victims ' loved ones have been spared some anguish ? " if we 'd had the technology before , we would now have the causes of the crash and it would be less painful , " said @entity2 , a 59 - year - old electrical engineer who works in the @entity67 defense industry			1
he helps lead a group of more than 300 others who also lost loved ones aboard @entity12 , all of whose grief would be less intense , he said , if they could only know why			1
did the plane crash because of pilot error or bad weather or equipment malfunction ? speculation has been easy to come by , but answers have been elusive			2
what caused the crash ? two years ago in @entity88 , the @entity87 crash spurred @entity90 aviation safety officials to look into uplinking critical flight data to orbiting satellites from airplanes flying across vast oceans			1
here 's how advocates say such a system would work : currently flight data recorders use computer chips to record information about how the plane is working in flight			1
another device , the cockpit voice recorder , records audio from crew members including pilots			0
if the plane crashes over a large body of water , the devices ca n't be retrieved without help from special recovery teams			2
see photos of @entity12 black boxes and wreckage a new system being researched by the @entity117 would uplink airplane data about its location , direction , equipment functions and about 30 other parameters to orbiting satellites , which would then beam the data back to the ground for storage			1
in the event of a crash , that data could be easily accessed from the storage sites and then analyzed for clues to what caused the disaster			1
advocates say such a system -- although pricey -- could save millions of dollars in operations to recover on - board flight data devices			1
searching for the @entity87 devices and aircraft wreckage cost $ 40 million , according to a report by @entity67 's aviation investigation agency , the @entity143 et analyses			1
" fortunately they found these boxes , " said @entity144 , a former @entity117 investigator , " but who knows , tomorrow we could lose another airplane and not be so lucky			2
" the time saved by having immediate access to aircraft data offers critical safety benefits , said @entity144 , because experts could warn airlines sooner about potential equipment problems blamed for the crash			1
but skeptics cite several reasons why in - flight data uplinks might not work , including high costs , limited bandwidth , security concerns , privacy issues , and cumbersome aviation bureaucracies			1
in fact , two powerful government bureaucracies with oversight of the @entity90 aviation industry -- the @entity117 and the @entity170 -- disagree about the promise of in - flight uplinks			0
" while the technology may exist , the use of telemetry for commercial airplanes is not currently practical due to bandwidth issues , " said an @entity170 spokeswoman			2
@entity179 , the @entity117 's chief technical adviser for vehicle recorders , who 's been studying flight recorder technology for decades , is optimistic about a solution			2
bandwidth issues can be beat , @entity179 says , by limiting data and only uploading it to satellites when necessary			1
the data upload would begin automatically if the plane shows signs of distress during flight			2
" you would n't get a continuous data stream -- it would be activated by an automatic trigger -- but at least you would get the data when it counts , " said @entity179			1
the @entity117 and @entity67 's @entity197 are asking the industry for data from past accidents to help design " trigger criteria " that would be used to activate the uplink system			1
" @entity34 is seriously looking at providing that triggering criteria technology as standard equipment on large aircraft , " said @entity179			0
a @entity197 report on the crash of @entity12 said uplink technology would cost more than $ 10,000 to retrofit each airliner			1
however , @entity179 says much of the satellite uplink technology already exists aboard many of the world 's newer airliners as part of a ground - to - plane messaging technology called the @entity215 and @entity216			2
@entity218 , @entity219 - based @entity217 makes about 60 % of flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorders used on @entity90 aircraft , according to vice president of engineering @entity223			2
" people ca n't understand why we ca n't simply strap a cell phone onto an airplane and move a bunch of data around , " said @entity223			1
" this is a complicated system			0
complicated systems cost a lot of money			2
they do n't always work right			0
i 'm a little skeptical about , one , how necessary it is right now , and two , how realistic it is that somebody 's going to foot the bill for this in the short term			0
" representing the airline industry , the @entity243 says it 's concerned about the potential cost and wants to assess the overall need for such a system within the aviation community			1
but @entity249 , former top @entity117 administrator , says an uplink system " ought to be ordered immediately for all extended range aircraft right away			0
we ought to just do it			0
there 's no reason not to			0
" " the aviation industry historically fights what they consider to be extraneous safety mandates , particularly if it costs them money that they can not immediately recover , " said @entity249 , who compared the situation to the cargo hold fire that led to the 1996 @entity219 crash of @entity259 , which killed all 110 passengers and crew			0
@entity249 said he and his @entity117 colleagues fought industry push - back for their recommendation that smoke detectors and fire suppression systems be mandatory equipment in airplane cargo holds			0
" it cost about 10 % of what they thought it was going to be , and we have n't had any fires in cargo holds since then , " he said			1
" there 's always an opposition			0
" industry figures worry about other questions that may trouble developers of the uplink system , including how to protect the data from hackers			0
uplinked audio likely would have to be encrypted , experts say , because privacy laws protect audio from cockpit voice recorders from being released to the public			0
the @entity117 considered other methods of collecting data from troubled aircraft , including " deployable " systems that would eject from distressed planes to be picked up later by search teams			1
researchers determined satellite uplinks to be the most promising			0
the @entity305 is looking into the possibility of using similar technology to monitor hijacked aircraft , said @entity179			0
at their home in @entity67 , the @entity16 hope clues from the newly found data recorders will shed some light on why their loved ones died , two long years ago			0
" i will be in peace when i know the truth , " @entity2 said			0
" i need to know exactly what happened			0

experts question why black box data is n't uploaded to satellites
critics : it 's *expensive* and needs too much bandwidth
advocates : it would have eased grief for @entity87 crash victims
search for @entity12 black boxes cost $ 40 million
