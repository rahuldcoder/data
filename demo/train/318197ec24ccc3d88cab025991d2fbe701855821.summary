in " @entity28 : the journey from @entity3 to @entity33 , " @entity21 writes about presidential road trips , some which were tainted by tragedy			1
@entity21 describes the first century of presidential travel as " littered with grisly accidents , unpleasant near misses , and just plain discomfort			0

" @entity14 during a 1902 road trip through @entity45 , president @entity14 was traveling in a carriage that collided with a trolley car , @entity21 writes			1
the crash threw @entity14 from the carriage and killed @entity11 agent @entity49 , the first @entity11 agent to lose his life while protecting the president , according to @entity21			1

@entity58 a railroad trip took its toll on the health of president @entity58 , @entity21 said			1
" when he made a railroad tour in 1849 , it almost killed him			2
" " he was fairly old at the time , and these trips were brutal , because before each stop on the route , the influential townspeople would get on the train and want to talk with the president , " @entity21 said			2
" this meant 30 to 40 people battling for the president 's attention , trying to talk to him , shake hands until they reached the town			2
" @entity58 's trip was supposed to last a couple of months , according to @entity21			2
within two weeks , he was sick and exhausted , " and they have to take him back to the @entity80			0
" @entity58 died suddenly a year later after eating a snack of cherries and milk			0
@entity84 in 1833 , president @entity84 was traveling through @entity85 when his horse - drawn procession crossed a bridge connecting the @entity88 and @entity89			0
the bridge collapsed , plunging " dignitaries of every age and shape ... into the shallow depths , all drenched , all frightened , and all struggling to regain solid ground , " @entity21 quoted from newspaper reports			0
