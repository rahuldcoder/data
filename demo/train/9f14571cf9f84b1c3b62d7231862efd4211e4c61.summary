-- the most " complicated " handmade watch in the world has been sold at auction for an historic $ 24.4 million			1
the @entity5 timepiece , made by the luxury watchmaker @entity6 in 1933 for the prominent banker @entity7 , was sold at @entity8 in @entity9			1
the sale smashed the world record for the most expensive watch ever sold at auction , which was previously held by the same watch			1
in 1999 , it was sold to @entity16 of the @entity18 royal family , for $ 11 million			1
the watch was released in 2014 to coincide with the 175th anniversary of the @entity9 watch maker			0
the sale has benefited from the boom in @entity6 auction values over the last 15 years			2
the term " complication " is a technical one , and refers to any aspect of a watch that offers a function that is not simply telling the time			2
the timepiece -- which has been called " the most important watch in the world , " " one of the wonders of the world , " and " the collector 's holy grail " -- boasts 24 such complications			1
these include grande and petite sonnerie ( chimes ) , which emulate the bells of @entity45 ; a record of the phases and age of the moon ; sunrise and sunset indications ; a " perpetual calendar " that makes automatic adjustments for month and year ; and a celestial map of the @entity54 sky			0
the celestial map alone is a remarkable feat of engineering			0
it charts the precise spacing and density of the stars , and rotates at the same pace as the sky as it would have appeared from its owner 's @entity68 apartment			0
the watch is comprised of 900 individual parts , and , according to @entity8 's , is the most advanced timepiece ever made without the assistance of computers			1
it was last wound in 1969 , yet remains in perfect working order			0
the @entity5 was made as the result of a friendly competition between @entity7 , a member of a well - known banking family , and @entity82 , the luxury automobile manufacturer , to see who could produce the most impressive timepiece			1
@entity87 's attempt was a pioneering feat. it was the first ever watch to feature a sky chart , which included 500 golden stars and was centered above his home in @entity93			2
however , it contained just 10 complications , making @entity7 ' timepiece the undisputed winner with 24			2
one of the @entity5 's more obscure features is a sidereal time dial , which tracks the @entity101 's rate of rotation in relation to fixed stars			1
a " sidereal day " , which is used by astronomers , lasts for 23 hours , 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds			0
it is unclear whether @entity7 had any use for the functionality			0
" it 's amazing that they did all that without computers , " says @entity110 , the president of @entity6			2
" you are talking about one of the most collectible pieces ever put up for auction , if not the most collectible			0
" the @entity5 took @entity6 eight years to produce , from its commission in 1925 to delivery in 1933			1
the identity of the new buyer is unknown			0
