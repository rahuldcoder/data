-- here are reactions to the posting on @entity3 of tens of thousands of leaked @entity5 military and diplomatic reports on the war in @entity8 : @entity8 : " the @entity8 government is shocked with the report that has opened the reality of the @entity8 war , " said @entity9 , a government spokesman			2
@entity14 focused on the allegation that @entity16 was secretly supporting @entity17 and asserted that @entity18 needs to deal with the @entity16 intelligence agency , known as the @entity20			1
" there should be serious action taken against the @entity20 , who has a direct connection with the terrorists , " he said			0
" these reports show that the @entity5 was already aware of the @entity20 connection with the @entity17 terrorist network			0
the @entity5 is overdue on the @entity20 issue , and now the @entity5 should answer			0
" @entity16 : in a statement , @entity16 's foreign office said monday that the documents are " misplaced , skewed and contrary to the factual position on the ground			1
" " the people of @entity16 and its security forces , including the @entity20 , have rendered enormous sacrifices against militancy and terrorism			1
our contributions have been acknowledged by the international community , in particular by the @entity5			0
as underlined by the @entity5 national security adviser in his statement on @entity3 yesterday , the ongoing counterterrorism cooperation between @entity16 and the [ @entity5 ] will continue with a view to defeating our common enemies			1
" lt. gen. @entity48 , the former head of @entity16 's intelligence service who is mentioned numerous times in the @entity3 documents , called the accusations that @entity16 was secretly supporting @entity17 lies			1
@entity53 , @entity16 's federal information minister , said allegations against the @entity20 are " baseless			1
" " if someone has any evidence , it should be brought to us , and we will take action , " he said			0
" the @entity16 military , especially the @entity20 , has sacrificed more than any other forces in the war on terrorism			1
" a spokesman for @entity16 president @entity65 , @entity66 , said the " unsubstantiated leaks " based on uncorroborated " one - sided reports ... will not deter the @entity16 government 's commitment to the eradication of terrorism , peace with our neighbors and stability in the region			1
" @entity78 , @entity16 's ambassador to the @entity5 , issued a statement sunday saying the reports " do not reflect the current onground realities			1
" rather , they " reflect nothing more than single source comments and rumors , which abound on both sides of the @entity16 - @entity8 border and are often proved wrong after deeper examination , " @entity78 's statement said			1
" @entity16 's government under the democratically elected leadership of president @entity65 and prime minister [ @entity95 ] @entity96 is following a clearly laid out strategy of fighting and marginalizing terrorists , and our military and intelligence services are effectively executing that policy , " the statement said			1
@entity5 : sen. @entity104 , @entity105 , said in a statement that some of the documents " reinforce a longstanding concern of mine about the supporting role of some @entity16 officials in the @entity8 insurgency			1
" @entity104 , chairman of the @entity114 , said he had " strongly urged the @entity16 to take forceful action against militant networks using @entity16 as a base to attack @entity8 and our troops			1
" but he said @entity124 's new strategy " has yielded some tangible improvements in preparing @entity8 to take responsibility for its own security			1
" @entity126 press secretary @entity125 called the documents ' release " a breach of federal law " and said that an investigation into the source of the leak was initiated before late last week			1
but , he told reporters , " i do n't think that what is being reported has n't in many ways been publicly discussed -- whether by you or by representatives of the @entity5 government -- for quite some time			2
" asked about the leak , he said , " there is no doubt that this is a concerning development in operational security			2
" house speaker @entity143 said monday that the release would not affect a $ 33 billion war supplemental vote , to be held this week			1
" a lot of it predates the president 's new policy , " she said			0
rep. @entity150 , @entity151 , who is co-sponsoring a bill that would direct president @entity124 to remove @entity5 forces from @entity16 , said the documents " provide a fuller picture of what we have long known about @entity8 : the war is going badly			1
" he added , " it is not the leak of documents that endangers the lives of @entity5 troops and our allies , it is the belief that occupying @entity8 will make us safer			1
@entity169 must say no to war funding , bring our troops home and invest in the @entity5 recovery			2
" sen. @entity174 , vice chairman of the @entity175 , called the release of the documents " shocking			1
" " the damage to our national security caused by leaks like this wo n't stop until we see more perpetrators in orange jumpsuits , " the @entity179 @entity178 said in a statement			1
the senator stressed that the leak underscores the need to start taking more seriously the threat to national security that leaks cause			2
@entity174 pointed out that this is not a new problem : the bipartisan september 11 @entity195 found that national security was threatened by widespread leaks of classified information			0
this point was emphasized by former cia director @entity200 , who testified before @entity169 that because of leaks , the @entity5 effectively has applied " @entity204 " to terrorists : catching only the dumb ones			0
national security adviser gen. @entity205 issued a statement sunday condemning the documents ' release			2
" these irresponsible leaks will not impact our ongoing commitment to deepen our partnerships with @entity8 and @entity16 ; to defeat our common enemies ; and to support the aspirations of the @entity8 and @entity16 people , " the statement said			2
the @entity217 will not comment on them until the @entity217 has had a chance to look at them , a department official said			0
@entity222 chairman @entity221 , @entity223 , issued a statement sunday saying that the documents -- regardless of how they came to light -- " raise serious questions about the reality of @entity5 's policy toward @entity16 and @entity8			1
" @entity231 chairman @entity230 , @entity179 , issued a statement saying : " i am extremely concerned about the manner in which these documents were leaked and with the recklessness of @entity3 in posting them			0
our nation 's secrets are classified for a reason , and the release of classified documents could put our national security -- and the lives of our men and women in combat -- at serious risk			2
" these leaked documents , while troubling , appear to support what i was asserting for years : the war in @entity8 was not going well , and we needed a real strategy for success			2
for nearly a decade under the previous administration , our brave war fighters were under - resourced and lacked the direction of a clear strategy			0
under the new counterinsurgency strategy implemented earlier this year , we now have the pieces in place to turn things around			0
these leaked reports pre-date our new strategy in @entity8 and should not be used as a measure of success or a determining factor in our continued mission there			0
" additionally , some of these documents implicate @entity16 in aiding the @entity271 and fueling the insurgency in @entity8			1
it is critical that we not use outdated reports to paint a picture of the cooperation of @entity16 in our efforts in @entity8			2
since these reports were issued , @entity16 has significantly stepped up its fight against the @entity271 , including efforts that led to the capture of the highest ranking member of the @entity271 since the start of the war			2
the @entity16 military has also been in combat for more than a year against its country 's own @entity271 , which is aligned with @entity17 and the @entity8 @entity271 attacking @entity5 forces and our @entity290 allies			2
while we still have concerns about @entity16 's efforts against the @entity8 @entity271 , there is no doubt that there have been significant improvements in its overall effort			1
" @entity299 : @entity299 foreign secretary @entity300 said : " i have not seen those [ reports ] in detail , but they should not be damaging the international efforts			0
we saw last week in @entity8 the huge progress that is being made and the phenomenal challenges that are still in front of us in @entity8			0
but the fact that a good deal of progress is being made in building up the capacity of the @entity8 state and @entity8 working together with so many nations in the world			0
i hope any leaks will not poison that atmosphere , and i do not think they will			0
" @entity3 ' founder @entity316 said the documents are " legitimate , " but he added that it is important not to take their contents at face value			0
" we publish @entity323 reports all the time that are legitimate @entity323 reports			0
that does n't mean the @entity323 is telling the truth , " he said			0
" similarly , with this material , there is reporting from military units of various kinds , in @entity8 , @entity5 embassies across the world , about matters relevant to @entity8			0
... those are legitimate reports , " he said			0
" it does n't mean the contents are true			0
" @entity0 's @entity339 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity104 credits @entity124 strategy with " tangible improvements "
@entity143 says leak wo n't affect funding vote
@entity126 spokesman calls release " a breach of federal law "
@entity16 calls the documents " misplaced , skewed "
