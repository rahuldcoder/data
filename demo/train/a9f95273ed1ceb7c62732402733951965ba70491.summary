-- @entity1 has announced a major new initiative and a slew of new devices that enable users to print from any device to a web - enabled printer by simply using e-mail			1
the idea -- which builds off the @entity11 announcement we saw back in april -- starts with giving each printer its own unique e-mail address			1
that printer 's owner ( and their designated family , friends , and colleagues ) can then print documents by sending it an email from a smartphone , from a tablet , or any other device that allows it			1
called @entity28 , the technology eliminates the need for installing drivers and enables a variety of new apps and services			1
putting documents in the cloud the new printers that @entity1 is unveiling today along with @entity28 can connect directly to @entity35 using their touchscreen interface			1
that means users can print @entity40 directly from the cloud without using their desktop computer , as well as scan documents directly to their @entity40 account			2
other @entity11 services like @entity46 and @entity47 for photos are also supported			1
similarly , @entity50 and @entity51 users can also retrieve and push documents to and from the cloud through new print apps			0
a new opportunity for publishers another area @entity1 is exploring with the @entity28 concept is scheduled delivery			1
this allows users to get content printed at specific times -- for example , getting a customized daily newspaper printed out every morning that they can take with them on the train			0
@entity66 has signed on as a partner to pilot this concept , and @entity1 has teamed with @entity68 to sell the ads , which , you can imagine could include a mix of contextual advertising and locally relevant promotions and coupons			0
another platform for developers beyond productivity and news , initial apps include @entity80 for printing photos and events and @entity83 for printing maps and directions			0
@entity1 also sees a big opportunity for providing different types of activities for parents and kids , and to that end has signed on @entity92 for coloring pages and @entity94 for a variety of education - driven printing			0
as for the market size for developers here , @entity1 says it expects to ship , " tens of millions of web - connected printers " by the end of next year			2
currently , developers interested in building apps need to apply for access to @entity1 's @entity106			0
why 's @entity107 ? beyond selling printers , @entity1 needs to sell ink			2
with more and more types of documents getting digitized and smartphones replacing former functions of printers ( think coupons and tickets ) , @entity1 needs new ways to drive printer usage			1
web - connected printers fill this need in a few ways			2
first , they connect to the ever growing cloud for business users and make their lives easier			2
second , the email - to - print concept clearly has the potential to drive new kinds of usage , both from business users and consumers who do things like print photos and news			0
finally , there 's also opportunities for developers to create sticky apps -- perhaps not on the scale we 've seen in mobile , but with @entity1 betting the future of its printers on web connectivity , you can bet we 'll see some big winners emerge from the developer community			0
@entity1 will dive into these topics at apress conference this morning to kick off @entity152 @entity151 , where i 'll be moderating a panel with a number of the players involved in the new @entity28 initiative			1
we 'll try and bring you video of the discussion later on			0
disclosure : @entity1 is a sponsor of @entity0 's internet week @entity151 channel			0

the idea builds off the @entity11 announcement we saw in april
it works by giving each printer its own unique e-mail address
the new printers , along with @entity28 , can connect directly to @entity35
