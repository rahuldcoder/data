hundreds of people are dead as the worst ebola virus outbreak in history sweeps through @entity3			1
it began as a handful of cases in @entity7 in march but quickly spread to neighboring @entity8 and @entity9			0
here are nine things to know about what the @entity11 calls " one of the world 's most virulent diseases			2
" why does @entity16 generate such fear ? @entity18 ( @entity18 ) describes @entity16 as " one of the world 's most deadly diseases			1
" " it is a highly infectious virus that can kill up to 90 % of the people who catch it , causing terror among infected communities , " it says			1
there is also no vaccination against it			0
of @entity33 's five subtypes , the @entity31 strain -- the first to be identified -- is considered the most deadly			1
the @entity11 said preliminary tests on the ebola virus in @entity7 in march suggested that the outbreak there was this strain , though that has not been confirmed			2
what is @entity16 ? the ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever , which according to the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding			1
the virus is named after the @entity49 in the @entity31 ( formerly @entity31 ) , where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976			1
the same year there was another outbreak in @entity33			0
the @entity11 says there are five different strains of the virus -- named after the areas they originated in			1
three of these have been associated with large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in @entity3			1
these are the @entity63 -- an area of @entity65 where the virus was discovered in 2007 -- @entity33 and @entity31 sub-types			1
there has been a solitary case of @entity16			1
this subtype was discovered when a researcher studying wild chimpanzees became ill in 1994 after an autopsy on one of the animals			2
finally , @entity76 is named after @entity77 in the @entity79 state of @entity80 , where this fifth strain of the ebola virus was identified in monkeys imported from the @entity84			1
the @entity43 says while humans have been infected with @entity86 , there have been no cases of human illness or death from this sub-type			1
what are @entity33 's symptoms ? early symptoms include sudden onset of fever , weakness , muscle pain , headaches and a sore throat			1
these symptoms can appear two to 21 days after infection			1
the @entity11 says these nonspecific early symptoms can be mistaken for signs of diseases such as malaria , typhoid fever , meningitis or even the plague			2
@entity18 says some patients may also develop a rash , red eyes , hiccups , chest pains and difficulty breathing and swallowing			0
the early symptoms progress to vomiting , diarrhea , impaired kidney and liver function and sometimes internal and external bleeding			2
@entity16 can only be definitively confirmed by five different laboratory tests			2
how is it treated ? there are no specific treatments for @entity16			2
@entity18 says patients are isolated and then supported by health care workers			0
" this consists of hydrating the patient , maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure and treating them for any complicating infections , " it says			0
there have been cases of health care workers contracting the virus from patients , and the @entity11 has issued guidance for dealing with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus			0
caregivers are advised to wear impermeable gowns and gloves and to wear facial protection such as goggles or a medical mask to prevent splashes to the nose , mouth and eyes			0
@entity18 says it contained a 2012 outbreak in @entity65 by placing a control area around its treatment center			0
an outbreak is considered over once 42 days -- double the incubation period of the disease -- have passed without any new cases			0
what drugs exist to combat the disease ? two @entity79 missionary workers infected with @entity16 were given an experimental drug called @entity162 , which seems to have saved their lives			1
the drug , developed by a @entity166 firm , had never been tried before on humans , but it showed promise in small experiments on monkeys			0
but rolling out an untested drug during a massive outbreak would also be very difficult , according to @entity18			0
experimental drugs are typically not mass - produced , and tracking the success of such a drug if used would require extra medical staff where resources are already scarce			0
@entity162 's maker says it has very few doses ready for patient use			0
there are other experimental drugs			0
@entity184 , a @entity185 - based company that has a $ 140 million contract with the @entity79 @entity187 to develop an @entity16 drug , began phase 1 trials with its drug in january			1
but the @entity191 recently halted the trial , asking for more information			0
at least one potential @entity16 vaccine has been tested in healthy human volunteers , according to @entity196 , a leading researcher at the @entity197			2
and last week , the @entity198 announced that a safety trial of another @entity16 vaccine will start as early as september			2
and in march , the @entity198 awarded a five - year , $ 28 million grant to establish a collaboration between researchers from 15 institutions who were working to fight @entity16			2
" a whole menu of antibodies have been identified as potentially therapeutic , and researchers are eager to figure out which combinations are most effective and why , " a news release about the grant said			0
how does ebola virus spread ? the @entity11 says it is believed that fruit bats may be the natural host of the ebola virus in @entity3 , passing on the virus to other animals			2
humans contract @entity16 through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans			1
@entity18 says that while the virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism , chlorine disinfection , heat , direct sunlight , soaps and detergents can kill it			1
@entity18 epidemiologist @entity231 said outbreaks usually spread in areas where hospitals have poor infection control and limited access to resources such as running water			0
" people who become sick with it almost always know how they got sick : because they looked after someone in their family who was very sick -- who had diarrhea , vomiting and bleeding -- or because they were health staff who had a lot of contact with a sick patient , " she said			2
can plane passengers become infected ? while the @entity43 acknowledges it 's possible a person infected with @entity16 in @entity3 could get on a plane and arrive in another country , the chances of the virus spreading during the journey are low			1
" it 's very unlikely that they would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers , " said @entity257 , deputy director of @entity43 's @entity258 and @entity259			0
" the ebola virus spreads through direct contact with the blood , secretions , or other body fluids of ill people , and indirect contact -- for example with needles and other things that may be contaminated with these fluids			1
" he added that most people who have become infected with @entity16 lived with or cared for an ill patient			1
" this is not an airborne transmission , " said dr. @entity278 , director of @entity43 's @entity279			0
" there needs to be direct contact frequently with body fluids or blood			2
" travelers should take precautions by avoiding areas experiencing outbreaks and avoid contact with @entity16 patients			1
" it is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel , " @entity292 said in a statement			0
" in the rare event that a person infected with the ebola virus was unknowingly transported by air , @entity11 advises that the risks to other passengers are low			2
nonetheless , @entity11 does advise public health authorities to carry out contact tracing in such instances			0
" this means determining who had contact with the affected person			0
what should flight crew do if @entity16 infection is suspected ? the @entity43 has issued guidance for airline crews on ebola virus infections			1
" as with many other global infectious disease outbreaks , airline carriers , crew members , airports can be very important partners in that front line , " said @entity278			0
" being educated , knowing the symptoms , recognizing what to do , having a response protocol , knowing who to call , those are really , really important parts of the global containment strategy to deal with threats like this			0
" the @entity43 advises that when flight crew members encounter a passenger with symptoms that they suspect could be @entity16 , such as fever and bleeding , that they keep the sick person away from other passengers			1
they 've been instructed to wear disposable gloves and to provide the sickened person with a surgical mask to prevent fluids from spreading through talking , sneezing or coughing			0
the airline cleaning crew are also instructed to wear disposable gloves , wipe down surfaces including armrests , seat backs , trays and light switches			0
the @entity43 says that packages and cargo should not pose a risk , unless the items have been soiled with blood or bodily fluids			1
when someone becomes ill on a flight , the captain is required by aviation regulations to report the suspected case to air traffic control , according to @entity292			0
what is the risk of catching @entity16 on a plane ? how many cases have there been ? the @entity43 estimates there have been more than 3,000 cases of @entity16 and more than 2,000 deaths since 1976			1
the last recorded outbreaks before the current one in @entity7 were in 2012 -- in @entity65 and @entity31			1
the @entity65 outbreak involved a total of 24 probable and confirmed cases , and 17 deaths , according to the @entity11 , which declared it had ended in october 2012			0
@entity18 said the @entity65 outbreak had been the @entity33 strain , while the virus found in @entity31 was the @entity63 sub-type			1
before 2014 , the most deadly outbreak was the 1976 outbreak in then @entity31 , when 280 of 318 infected people died , according to the @entity43			1
in 2000 , there were 425 cases of @entity33 in @entity65 , which resulted in 224 fatalities .			0

@entity16 causes viral hemorrhagic fever and kills up to 90 % of people who catch it
it 's named after the @entity49 in @entity31 , where one of first outbreaks occurred in 1976
symptoms can take between two and 21 days to appear after *victim* contracts virus
humans contract @entity16 through contact with bodily fluids of infected animals or humans
