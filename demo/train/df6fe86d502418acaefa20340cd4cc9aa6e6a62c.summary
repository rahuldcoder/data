@entity0 , @entity1 -- justice fell short with the execution of @entity6 - area sniper @entity5 , one of his victims ' survivors said after witnessing his death by lethal injection			1
@entity5 died silently tuesday night in a @entity1 prison death chamber filled with lawyers , lawmen and his victims ' survivors			1
after the execution , @entity15 said he thought about @entity5 's accomplice , @entity17 , who received a life sentence for their crimes			1
" well , myself , i wish @entity17 was right there beside @entity5 , " said @entity15 , whose sister , @entity22 analyst @entity21 , was gunned down in @entity1			1
" they both committed the same crimes			2
no , i do n't feel any closure			2
i mean , it 's ... it ... nothing changes			2
" @entity5 was the mastermind behind the @entity6 - area sniper attacks of 2002 , which left 10 dead and terrorized the nation 's capital			1
he was declared dead at 9:11 p.m. et , said @entity34 , director of communications for the @entity35			2
" there were no complications , " @entity36 told reporters outside the @entity38			2
" mr. @entity5 was asked if he wished to make a last statement			1
he did not acknowledge this or make a last statement whatsoever			2
" in fact , @entity5 , 48 , said nothing from the time he entered the death chamber accompanied by guards at 8:58 p.m. , @entity36 said			1
but in a statement read by one of his attorneys , @entity5 still denied he had committed the crimes			1
" mr. @entity5 maintains his innocence in this case , and he always has			1
he is not remorseful , although he does extend his condolences to the families			0
what these families went through is tragic in every level			0
given the injustices in this case , what mr. @entity5 went through is equally as tragic , " said @entity59 , who was @entity5 's stand - by attorney in his @entity61 trial , in which he represented himself			1
@entity15 said he had no sympathy for @entity5 and was angered by what he said were sympathetic media reports about @entity5 's children that had aired recently			1
" they 're talking about @entity5 's children , but @entity21 left children behind , too , " @entity15 said			1
" she 's got a daughter , @entity73 , and a son , @entity75 , that -- @entity77 just got back from his second tour in @entity79 in the @entity80			0
they 're not going to see their @entity82			0
so i do n't have any sympathy for his family or for his children			2
" @entity87 , whose 53 - year - old brother , @entity88 , was shot dead while pumping gas in @entity1 , called tuesday 's execution surreal			1
" watching the life be sapped out of somebody intentionally was very different and an experience i 'd never had , " he said on @entity2 's " @entity93			0
" " i 'd watched my mother die of natural causes , but that was very different			0
" he said he might have attained some closure , " but i would say that pretty much was overcome just by the sadness that the whole situation generates in my heart			0
that he would get to the place where he did what he did , and that it had to come to this			0
" @entity87 said he had forgiven @entity5 for two reasons : " one is that @entity109 calls for me to do that in the @entity111 and the second thing is related to that			1
if i do n't , it rots me from the inside out			0
it does n't really hurt @entity5 or anybody that i have bitterness against			1
" among the witnesses to the execution were about a dozen members of the prosecution task force			0
" he died very peacefully , much more than most of his victims , " said @entity123 , the @entity1 prosecutor who won the death penalty conviction			1
" i felt a sense of closure , and i hope that they did , too			0
" the execution came hours after @entity1 gov. @entity130 denied a last - minute clemency request tuesday for @entity5			1
@entity130 's announcement came a day after the @entity133 declined to intervene in the case			0
during three weeks in october 2002 , @entity5 and @entity17 , then 17 , killed 10 people and wounded three , while taunting police with written messages and phoned - in threats and demands			1
during two trials and in years of appeals , @entity5 professed his innocence			1
one of his trials included testimony from @entity17 , whose youth excluded him from consideration for the death penalty			0
in a written statement issued earlier tuesday , @entity5 's lawyer @entity148 accused @entity1 of racing to " execute a severely mentally ill man , who also suffered from @entity152 syndrome , the day before @entity153			1
" @entity5 , who opted not to select a spiritual adviser , met during the afternoon with his immediate family and lawyers , said @entity36			2
he leaves four children and two ex-wives , both of whom appeared monday on @entity2 's " @entity93			0
" @entity5 's first wife , @entity161 , showed a letter in which he asked her to visit him on his execution day			2
" @entity161 , i miss my family for the past eight years , " he wrote , referring to the time he was incarcerated			0
" i do n't want to be missed the day that these devils murder my innocent black ass			0
" asked about his father , @entity167 said his feelings about the death penalty had not softened with the approach of the execution			0
" if you commit a crime , you can pay the time , " he said			0
asked whether he thought his father regretted what he did , the younger @entity161 said , " yes , i really do			0
" @entity177 , the sniper 's second ex-wife and the mother of three of his children , told @entity2 on monday that she last saw him in 2001 at a custody hearing and had not sought to visit him in prison			0
" i had emotionally detached from @entity5 when i asked him for a divorce , " she said			2
" and my emotions were severed when he said that you have become my enemy and , as my enemy , i will kill you			0
" @entity2 's @entity191 contributed to this report from @entity0 , @entity1 .			2
