@entity0 has been struggling to earn her bachelor 's degree for seven years			1
with tuition for two courses at her @entity6 university demanding $ 2,300 , it 's not the workload that has her putting off the final class she needs to graduate in may			1
the 25 - year - old has worked as a maid and retail clerk to make ends meet , but she says that dating the men she encounters on @entity16 has proved to be a more lucrative endeavor			2
" i 've had a hard time finding jobs and keeping jobs , " she said			1
" i thought this would be a good way for me to have a relationship with someone and also make it , as these sites all say , mutually beneficial			0
" @entity0 is just one of many students who 've sought out sugar daddies online in a time of need			1
dating site @entity30 , which connects wealthy men with women looking for financial support , reports that female college students made up 44 % of the site 's total users in 2012			1
with tuition on the rise , that number will likely continue to climb			0
while some may compare the practice to prostitution or question the morality of trading money and gifts for affection , the people who use these sites contend that they 're merely a conduit for both parties getting what they want			0
what 's the draw ? men who engage in such relationships , many of whom are older and married , enjoy taking care of young women and assuming a mentor role in their lives , said @entity63 , who launched @entity16 in 2002			2
" you have some guys who like to spoil and pamper their women by taking them out to nice dinners , buying them gifts			0
some maybe help with the utility bills or take them on trips , " @entity63 added			0
" and there are other guys that will have an ongoing relationship in which they 'll say , ' ok , i 'll give you an allowance and you can put this toward whatever your needs are			2
' " the average monthly " allowance " sugar daddies on the site said they shell out is $ 3,000 , according to @entity84			1
so what do these " sugar daddies " get in return for all their generosity ? surprisingly , sex is n't a given			1
it 's obviously on the table , says @entity0 , but there are other motivations			1
" some of them just wanted to go out to eat , " she said			0
" some of them just wanted someone to talk to			0
some of them just said outright , ' can we ( have sex ) for this amount of money ? ' and i 've said no. " but she admits that sex ups the ante -- if a sugar baby consents to an intimate relationship , she 's likely to get more gifts out of her benefactor			1
" if you look at the language of various state statutes , the terms of many of the relationships fall under the definition of prostitution , " said @entity111 attorney @entity110 , who has studied " sugar dating			1
" authorities shy away from prosecuting sugar websites and their users because the relationships can mirror a typical romance , @entity110 said			1
plus , users are savvy enough not to broadcast online whether they 're trading sex for cash			2
sex is n't the only motivator for sugar daddies , according to @entity132 , the founder and ceo of @entity84			1
some also want to help a struggling young woman			0
@entity132 , 42 , ( who met his wife , 27 , on the site ) said most of the men on the site begin communication with potential sugar babies by asking them why they 're looking for a sugar daddy			1
he 's found that women who say they need money to pay for school get asked out more often than those who admit they want cash for breast implants , for instance			2
while most of the sugar daddies @entity0 has met through the website prefer to arrange a per - date per diem , one married man wrote her a check for $ 1,600 to go toward her tuition and rent after their monthlong courtship			1
she said she prefers dating married men because they tend to be more paternal and offer a steadier source of income than single men			2
is it prostitution by another name ? @entity84 's @entity132 said the men who subscribe to his site are discouraged from offering money on a per - date basis to avoid operating like an escort service			1
by crosschecking users ' photos with those on @entity173 and @entity174 , as well as monitoring conversations between members , @entity132 says he is able to weed out the escorts posting on his site			1
@entity179 - based criminal defense attorney @entity178 said there 's no crime in paying someone solely for his or her companionship			2
" the crime is when you pay someone to engage in sexual conduct , " he added			0

she said she does n't consider herself a prostitute because she does n't have sex with most of the men she meets through the site			2
the 23 - year - old started engaging in relationships with older , wealthy men after moving away from home at 18			0
an older colleague saw she was having trouble supporting herself , so he started inviting her on golf trips with his friends and buying her gifts			0
the man told her , " you 're only going to be young and hot for so long			0
take advantage of it while you can			0
" @entity191 got used to the perks			0
she said sugar daddies have offered her cars , vacations and apartments , but she prefers cash			1
why go the sugar route ? @entity179 - based licensed mental health therapist @entity223 said sugar relationships are all about power and youth			0
on one hand , he said , these relationships remind the men of a more carefree time in their own lives			0
on the other hand , there 's a great sense of control			0
" they can take things away and limit the amount of money they 're going to spend on the young lady			0
they can steer ( the relationship ) into any direction they want to			0
" though @entity191 says she 's not ashamed of her unconventional part - time job , she does n't make a habit of telling everyone about it			2
when her mother asks how she can afford to not work , she says her ex-boyfriend helps her pay her credit card bills , which some people might consider a sugar relationship in its own right			0
@entity0 , on the other hand , said her relationship with a family member suffered after she opened up about her experience dating sugar daddies : " he said , ' you 're selling your body online			1
' " despite @entity0 ' qualms about accepting money in exchange for her companionship , she has no plans to deactivate her account anytime soon			2
she said she does n't have parents who can help her pay for school , so she relies on the kindness of wealthy men out of desperation			0
without the extra income , @entity0 said she 'd be back at the homeless shelter she lived in for three months in 2009			2
" in my heart of hearts i do n't really like the situation , " @entity0 said			2
" right now it 's a survival mechanism			0
" @entity16 's @entity63 said the relationship between a sugar baby and sugar daddy is all about perspective			1
" i helped my wife get through school , i pay for the bills , take her on trips , buy her nice gifts , " he said			0
" i guess you could say a lot of married guys are sugar daddies without them realizing it			1
i think you can say basically any guy who wants to impress a woman is a sugar daddy			1
