@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 is working the streets , watching clubbers spill from one bar to the next when he spots his next mark -- two westerners in one of @entity1 's most notorious areas			1
it 's a little after 10pm when @entity3 sees me and my cameraman -- though he does n't have a camera visible with us on this night -- rolling out of a sports bar known for its bounty of women offering ' companionship ' in @entity20 , @entity1 's unofficial red light district			1
he strides over quickly , waving a little white flier in our faces			2
the street is teeming with people after an evening rain			2
pedestrians dodge neon - bathed puddles while darting behind and between passing cars			1
on the sidewalk , several homeless families have bedded down on cardboard for the night			2
on the block ahead , we see teams of girls in tight - fitting cocktail dresses and school girl uniforms standing in front of karaoke bars , calling out to western businessmen to come inside and join them for a little fun			1
where are you going ? " @entity3 says			2
" i know where there lots of girls			1
this way , " he says , thrusting the pamphlet into our hands			2
@entity3 is a recruiter for a number of nightclubs in the area			2
" we are looking for young , pretty girls " my cameraman asks , playing the part			1
" where can we find them ? " @entity3 grins broadly			0
" we make small talk as @entity3 happily walks us the several blocks to the first bar			0
my photographer and i do n't tell our new friend that we 're actually working at the moment ; on the lookout for evidence of forced prostitution or children being sold for sex			1
it 's part of the two year - long investigation @entity2 embarked on as part of its @entity82 , an initiative to help the battle against modern - day slavery			1
it 's estimated 800,000 people are involved in prostitution in the @entity0			1
the government and @entity88 estimates on the number of women trafficked range from 300,000 to 400,000 and the number of children trafficked range from 60,000 to 100,000			1
click here to get full infographic on human trafficking in the @entity0 we follow @entity3 down the street , until we come upon a little door guarded by a large bouncer			1
he opens the door and our eyes struggle to accept the flood of pink fluorescent light bathing the room			1
@entity108 's " @entity107 " blares from unseen speakers			1
along the wall a dozen girls seated in a row stare at the newcomers			1
a few wave hello , most look bored			0
just sitting and waiting to be selected			0
a few red plastic tables are scattered around the room , each decorated by a single man sitting and drinking			1
one man has a girl he 's chosen sitting beside him			1
she 's kissing the lobe of his ear			1
there are no empty tables left , so the manager puts us on the side of the l - side couch , opposite the girls			1
it feels a little like it 's an adolescent school dance , with everyone waiting for someone else to make the first move			1
i struggle for a place to look away from the gaze of the girls and cast my eyes to the ground			1
a cockroach skitters around the legs of the tables and chairs and patrons ' feet			0
the manager is behind the bar , getting us beers			0
she sees me looking at the cockroach and laughs from across the room			0
" our pet , " she says			0
the girls giggle , somewhat embarrassed			1
i force a smile , but another patron , who had n't heard the quip gets up from his chair and smashed his shoe down on the husky insect			0
the girls groan and the manager pretends to cry			1
my photographer and i race through our @entity166 and leave			0
@entity3 is there outside the door			0
he leads us through a labyrinth of roads and alleys			0
fifteen minutes later , near the @entity1 port , we arrive at a strip club			1
we 're seated near the front of the stage , where two girls sway in a bored dance			2
this time instead of the girls sitting in a line , the manager brings them to us			1
more than a dozen girls in skimpy cocktail dresses line up in front of us			1
the manager shines a flashlight across each of their faces			0
he tells us to select one			0
" no , that 's okay			2
i do n't want one , " my photographer says			0
in the back , smaller than the others , i see a young girl , hiding behind the others			2
i ca n't tell if she 's frightened or uninterested			2
" the other girls part way			2
she hesitantly makes her way to sit beside me			0
she orders an ice tea			0
when the bill arrives , we 'll find out it cost us $ 22			0
how old are you ? i ask " 18 , " she says			0
" really ? you look younger			0
" she does n't budge			0
" 18 , " " do you like working here ? " she looks forlornly at the stage			0
" how long have you been working ? " three months			0
" despite our best efforts , she has no interest in giving up information to two white strangers			0
read what girls rescued from trafficking say we decide to leave and end up getting into an argument with the manager			2
the bill for two beers and an iced tea comes to $ 83 dollars			0
but carrying undercover camera equipment , and because of the size and number of security guards , we only offer a half - hearted protest			1
we would go to several other bars and speak to a number of women working in the sex industry			1
some seemed to enjoy their work , but most said it was a sort of last resort			0
they had children at home they have to feed and they had n't been able to find any other work			2
still , it 's important to note , no one we spoke with said they were being forced to do this work by another person despite our suspicions and their youthful looks			2
often , skeptics of the modern slavery issue will point to a story like this as proof that it does n't exist , or that the problem is overblown			0
but the absence of evidence is not evidence of its absence and the simple fact is ; it is very hard to get deep enough into an underground criminal culture to find evidence of trafficking , especially in a single night			0
it 's equally difficult to convince a person who may be in that situation that it is safe and wise to speak openly with a foreigner			2
in filming the documentary , " the @entity276 , " we witnessed the hard work of the @entity0 government 's @entity270 , honest police officers and anti-slavery organizations like the @entity274 and @entity275			1
they are working to ensure that jaunts like the one we attempted are n't successful , not only for a night , but for good .			0
