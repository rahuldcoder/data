@entity0 -- leading @entity3 @entity2 on wednesday strongly criticized this week 's planned congressional hearing into the alleged radicalization of members of their community , calling it an unfair attack on loyal citizens and a dangerous break from the traditional @entity3 embrace of tolerance and pluralism			2
rep. @entity15 , the chairman of the @entity16 , has said thursday 's hearing is necessary to explore the extent to which @entity19 is trying to influence and indoctrinate @entity3 muslims , among other things			1
but his plans have created an uproar , with critics accusing @entity26 leaders of bigotry and comparing the hearings to sen. @entity30 's allegations of @entity32 infiltration in the early years of the @entity33			1
@entity3 @entity2 leaders have also taken issue with @entity15 's assertion that they have n't sufficiently cooperated with law enforcement officials , and dismissed his claim that the overwhelming majority of mosques are run by extremist imams			1
such claims are " demonstrably false , " said @entity43 , executive director of the @entity44 ( @entity44 )			0
" except for a tiny minority , " extremists have found " no fertile ground in @entity3 , " he said			0
he said @entity15 is engaged in " fear - mongering , " and called the @entity49 @entity26 " unfit " to head the @entity16			1
" we are not in denial as a community that something is going on , that there are bad actors in every community , " said @entity50 , a member of the @entity51			0
@entity15 is " onto something , but he is going in the wrong direction			1
" and attorney general @entity61 weighed in as well , disputing @entity15 's premise that @entity64 leaders have n't done enough to help police during a news conference wednesday afternoon			1
@entity61 said the @entity67 has tried to establish a dialogue with @entity69 , " so that information flows to us , information flows from us			1
" and he warned against doing anything to " alienate entire communities			1
" " leaders of the @entity2 community and the @entity76 itself have contributed significantly to the resolution of many of the things that we have resolved over the course of the last 12 to 18 months , " @entity61 said			1
" tips that we have received , information that has been shared , has been critical to our efforts to disrupting plots that otherwise might have occurred			0
" in an interview with @entity1 , @entity15 shot back , " that 's not my experience			1
" " @entity49 is the epicenter , and i 'm not aware of any tips that have been given in @entity92 , @entity93 [ counties ] or @entity49 , " he said			0
and then talking to officials around the country , i get the same complaints			0
" @entity61 has not been called to testify in @entity15 's hearings , because he would contradict those complaints , @entity15 acknowledged			1
and he said top @entity101 administration officials also say @entity19 is attempting to radicalize @entity3 muslims , so " where else would we look ? " " i wo n't demonize anyone , " he said			1
" we 're going to show the threat is coming from certain elements and in many ways threatens @entity69 as much as it does the entire country			2
" but @entity109 , executive director of the @entity110 , said @entity15 is more interested in " scoring cheap political points by vilifying vulnerable communities			1
" on tuesday , a national group , @entity113 , launched a website aimed at tracking what it calls @entity118 rhetoric , particularly among elected officials			0
" our concern is that the @entity15 hearings are going to sow fear and mistrust of the @entity2 community at a time when the nation needs to be coming together , " said @entity120 , executive director of the group that launched @entity122			1
" it 's essentially a congressional stamp of approval for @entity118 hate			2
" in an earlier interview on @entity1 's " @entity135 , " @entity15 promised a " thoughtful , meaningful , very fair hearing " and insisted he was not condemning @entity64 as a religion or @entity3 muslims as a group			1
" i would never question anyone 's religious beliefs , " he said			2
" the overwhelming majority of @entity2 are outstanding patriots			0
" but he added , " there is a very small percentage who have allied themselves with @entity19 , " and he said @entity3 @entity2 leaders " do not face up to that reality			1
" " i want to encourage people in the @entity76 ... to be more aggressive in choosing their leaders , " he said			2
" i do n't think the leadership right now -- groups such as @entity44 -- are doing an adequate job			2
i think in some ways doing a very poor job of representing the @entity69 community			0
" @entity44 spokesman @entity157 dismissed @entity15 's criticism , telling @entity1 the congressman " does n't like that @entity44 criticizes his past @entity118 statements and his @entity162 hearing			1
" some critics of the hearings have called @entity15 's efforts against @entity64 - @entity3 terrorism hypocritical			1
in the 1980s , @entity15 , an @entity168 , was an active supporter of the @entity169 , an organization the @entity171 then deemed a terror group , and @entity173 , the leader of the @entity169 's political wing			1
the @entity169 was responsible for hundreds of civilian deaths in terror attacks			2
but @entity15 , however , has defended his efforts , calling the @entity169 " a legitimate force " for decades			1
the congressman has insisted he only got involved so heavily with @entity173 because he knew @entity173 would be willing to broker peace with the @entity182 government			2
a january 2010 study from researchers at @entity185 and the @entity186 concluded that the threat stemming from radicalized @entity2 is overblown			0
in the eight years following the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , 139 @entity2 - @entity3 engaged in terrorism - related violence or were prosecuted for terrorism - related offenses with violent elements , the researchers concluded			2
that level -- roughly 17 individuals per year -- " is small compared to other violent crime in @entity3 , but not insignificant			0
" " homegrown terrorism is a serious , but limited , problem , " they asserted			0
the report concluded that effective self - policing , denunciations of terrorism , and heightened political engagement were among the factors helping to minimize radicalization in the @entity69 community			0
critics such as @entity15 , however , point to a number of recent examples of alleged homegrown terrorism as evidence of a dangerous trend , including the case of @entity169 maj. @entity213 , a psychiatrist charged with killing 13 people at @entity215 in 2009			1
@entity213 had been in contact with militant cleric @entity217 , who was born in @entity218 and preached at a mosque in @entity220 before leaving the @entity3 for @entity221			0
last april , @entity49 taxi driver @entity222 pleaded guilty to involvement in a 2009 plot to blow up crowded subway trains			0
prosecutors said @entity222 conspired with another man -- @entity228 -- who also pleaded guity and cooperated with authorities			0
according to a recent study from the @entity235 and @entity236 , the number of cases of @entity3 citizens or residents charged with or convicted of taking part in terrorist activities has jumped in recent years			0
there were 76 such cases in 2009 and 2010 -- nearly half the total since september 11 , 2001			0
but @entity2 - @entity3 have played a key role in stopping such plots , noted @entity244 , a @entity1 national security analyst			0
more than 20 percent of post- 9/11 @entity246 terror cases in the @entity3 began with tips from @entity2 community members or involved cooperation from the family members of alleged plotters , he said			0
@entity252 , director of @entity254 's @entity253 , told @entity1 wednesday that the threat of radicalized @entity3 " continues to metastasize ( and ) comes in varies shapes , sizes , and forms			2
" " to suggest that we do n't face a threat is wrong , " @entity252 noted			2
" but to look for a single profile , unfortunately that does n't exist right now			0
" @entity1 's @entity263 , @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , and @entity267 contributed to this report .			0
