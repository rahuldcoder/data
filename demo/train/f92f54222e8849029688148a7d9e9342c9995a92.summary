-- the phrase : " president @entity2 " is music to the ears of conservatives who are eager to prove they are not anti-hispanic while still supporting one of their own : a solid conservative			1
and so it is that , as the immigration debate reignites , the @entity12 senator 's star power is winning over the world of conservative talk radio			1
whether it 's the radio shows hosted by @entity19 or @entity20 or @entity21 , @entity2 's appearances are being met with gushing accolades			1
the talkers are not sold on everything he says about how to fix the immigration system , but they 're praising him nonetheless			0
@entity19 called @entity2 a " very , very impressive man			2
" @entity21 swooned : " well , what you are doing is admirable and noteworthy			0
you 're trumpeting it , you 're shouting it			0
the reality that @entity2 is recognizing is twofold			2
one , the nation 's immigration system is broken and fixing it requires figuring out what to do with the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the @entity40			2
and two , the @entity41 , if it hopes to live to fight another day in a country that is increasingly ethnically diverse , ca n't just be known as the party that is against illegal immigration but has to build a reputation for supporting legal immigration as well			1
@entity2 : @entity47 sees immigration as a ' political ' matter @entity2 thinks that the way you fix both problems is comprehensive immigration reform -- securing the border , making it easier for high - skilled immigrants to get green cards , starting a guest worker program for industries like agriculture with jobs @entity40 are n't doing , and creating a conditional pathway to earned citizenship for the undocumented			2
many republicans have a word for that : " amnesty			0
" and , almost uniformly , conservative talk radio does not like amnesty			1
yet , you would n't know it by the warm reception that @entity2 got when he got on the airwaves			2
right - wing talkers are smitten with the @entity76 @entity41 and potential 2016 presidential candidate			2
and it is spilling into the immigration debate			1
so much so that @entity21 felt compelled in his show on both wednesday and thursday to insist that , no , he had not fallen madly for @entity2 , who had been a guest on his show the day before			0
@entity21 explained to his millions of listeners that he liked and admired @entity2 and considered him a strong conservative and a star of the @entity41			1
and @entity21 suggested that this fondness for the senator might have left some thinking that he was endorsing the immigration reform plan put forth on monday by @entity2 and seven other senators from both parties			1
@entity21 is not there and he may never get there			0
he still rejects as " amnesty " the idea of giving illegal immigrants an earned pathway to citizenship and rejects it as unacceptable			0
besides , he insists , if the border is n't secure , @entity2 is likely to drop his support for the plan as well			0
what @entity21 thinks about immigration -- a subject he does n't really know very well -- is n't important			0
what is important is the massive footprint that @entity2 is already leaving on the immigration debate , the value that he adds to the @entity108 's reform - minded " @entity107 , " and the near - hypnotic effect he 's having on some conservatives who -- while they do n't like what he 's proposing to fix the nation 's immigration system -- do like him a great deal			1
@entity2 , pitching immigration plan to conservatives , identifies sticking points alas , the love fest is not complete			1
not all conservatives are willing to give @entity2 the benefit of the doubt			2
some conservative bloggers -- including @entity123 and the folks at @entity125 -- are vehemently opposed to what he is proposing , and they 've gone after him aggressively			0
@entity41 sen. @entity127 of @entity128 has characterized the @entity2 approach to immigration reform as " amazingly naive			1
" but that hostility has n't followed @entity2 onto talk radio			1
so what 's going on here ? why is n't @entity2 getting more static from the radio talkers ? i can think of three reasons			1
first , the @entity41 has big plans for @entity2 , which may include the presidency , and the talkers know enough to get out of the way of a speeding train			1
besides , when they interview him , even if they could slice him up rhetorically into itty - bitty pieces -- and i 'm not sure they could -- why would they want to ? second , @entity2 is a thoughtful communicator who understands radio and excels in that medium			2
i 'm a former radio talk show host who has worked in a half dozen markets , and i know that doing that kind of work teaches you that there is such a thing as talking for radio			0
if you understand pacing , and when to pause or accelerate , you 'll hit a homerun			0
and third , whether many @entity41 realize it or not , there is a strong conservative case to be made for fixing our immigration system by encouraging the free flow of labor and saving illegal immigrants from heavy - handed enforcement tactics			1
the @entity47 administration divides thousands of families and deported a record number of people , more than 400,000 , in 2012			0
if you 're a conservative who supports the free market , family values and limited government -- and who does n't like the spectacle of immigration agents busting down doors and hauling away grandmothers in handcuffs and dropping kids in foster care -- comprehensive immigration reform could be for you			0
after all , he has already charmed a crowd that is notoriously hard to please			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			0

@entity192 : conservative talk radio hosts are gushing over @entity2
@entity192 : as the immigration debate reignites , @entity2 's star power is increasing
he says the @entity41 has big plans for the senator , including maybe the presidency
@entity192 : not all conservatives agree with @entity2 , but he 's affecting immigration debate
