@entity0 frequently had " stage 3 " smog alerts when i was a kid , meaning that we were n't supposed to play outside			1
fortunately , those days are over			0
air quality in @entity5 , including @entity0 , has vastly improved from decades ago			1
but compared to other states and to the @entity8 health standards , @entity5 is way behind on cleaning up its air pollution			1
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) just released its annual " @entity14 " report listing the most polluted cities in the @entity13			1
of the seven worst cities ranked as having the worst air quality , six -- including @entity0 - are in @entity5 , despite the state having the toughest regulations in the country			1
why is this ? the two biggest air pollution culprits are transportation sources such as cars and trucks and stationary sources such as oil refineries and industrial facilities			1
the @entity10 rankings look at two different pollutants : ozone ( smog ) and fine particulate matter			0
ground - level ozone is formed when nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds " cook " in sunlight to produce ozone			0
this mix of chemicals largely stems from the burning of fossil fuels : the pollution that comes from our power plants and industrial facilities and from the exhaust pipes of our cars , trucks , ships and trains			1
the ozone smog that comes from this chemical stew burns the eyes , makes breathing painful and can cause chest pain , coughing , throat irritation and can worsen asthma			0
children are at greatest risk from exposure because their lungs are still developing , and they are more likely to be active outdoors when ozone levels are high			0
rising temperatures from climate change will only serve to spur even more of this pollution			0
particulate matter , the other major air pollutant in cities , is often smaller than the diameter of a human hair			0
just like ozone , fossil fuel combustion at power plants and by cars and trucks plays a major role in its production			1
the very small particles can lodge deep in the lungs , causing health risks such as premature death in people with heart or lung disease , asthma aggravation and decreased lung function			0
children and seniors are at the greatest risk from particulate pollution			0
and we 're seeing these human health impacts all across @entity5 and the @entity92			2
if you 've been to @entity0 , you know how bad the traffic is -- it can take me 2 hours to drive the 18 miles from my office to @entity97			2
all those vehicles contribute to @entity5 's horrible air pollution			2
it 's true that cars now emit fewer pollutants -- due to regulation at the federal and state level -- but @entity0 simply has too many cars for the carrying capacity of the region			1
a massive increase in public transit , hybrid and zero - emission cars and trucks is a sound solution to help alleviate this pollution			1
the intense truck traffic on @entity0 's freeways is a symptom of the @entity0 area ports ' successes			2
over 80 % of all @entity13 imports from @entity122 come through these ports , and roughly 40 % of those imports are moved by diesel trucks			1
@entity5 state air regulators have taken strong steps to clean up the diesel truck fleet , but we are far from where we need to be -- diesel trucks , collectively , are still an enormous source of particulate pollution			1
another solution is replacing fossil - fueled trucks that haul cargo containers to and from @entity0 ' ports with zero - emission freight movement systems such as electric trucks			1
ports and regulators have already spent many millions of dollars developing these sensible 21st century systems , but industry has yet to deploy them			0
the @entity145 , @entity5 's other pollution center , is largely a rural area and home to the state 's agricultural industry			2
the wide , flat valley , like @entity0 , is surrounded by mountains that trap air			2
since the valley 's population is growing , there are also more cars and trucks			2
and two major north - south truck routes , @entity158 and @entity13 99 , bisect the valley			0
off - road vehicles used in agriculture as well as agricultural practices such as burning off fields also contribute to particulate matter overload			0
i drove through the valley on my way to @entity169 last october , but the smog was so thick i could n't see the @entity172 range until i was there			0
bottom line : too many cars and trucks , and too much fossil fuel combustion by vehicles , power plants and industry are the problem			0
and climate change is only making it worse			0
but there 's hope : @entity5 leads the movement towards a clean , renewable energy future , and if we can accelerate that transition , we have a fighting chance of getting off the @entity10 's " worst " list .			1

a new report lists the most polluted cities in the @entity13 , including several @entity5 cities
@entity197 : there are too many cars and trucks , oil refineries and industrial facilities
he says @entity0 , for example , needs to massively expand its public transit system
@entity197 : @entity5 needs to accelerate development of clean , renewable energy
