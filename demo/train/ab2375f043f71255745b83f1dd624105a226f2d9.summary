@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 sometimes gets ribbed for his outsized ideas , like the massive stage built in @entity6 , @entity7 , to accept the @entity9 presidential nomination			1
but an artist in @entity11 , @entity1 , may be about to outdo the candidate himself			1
large - format sketches have long been a focus of artist @entity16 's work			1
the artist plans to create a gigantic face of @entity3 sculpted from gravel and sand , which will cover nearly 2.5 acres ( 1 hectare ) of @entity11 beachfront before the @entity23 elections			1
" the size of the piece is intrinsic to its value , " the artist , @entity16 , said saturday			2
he hopes it will be big enough to be seen on @entity28			0
" @entity3 's personality -- his youth , personal history and message of a new politics -- has fused with the historical moment to create someone larger than life , " says the artist 's dossier about the work , titled " expectation			1
" the huge size also alludes " to the global impact of this election , " the dossier adds			0
ireport.com : what do you want to ask sen. @entity3 ? @entity16 , 42 , is a @entity47 - born @entity23 who grew up in @entity48 , @entity49 , near @entity50 , and now lives in @entity11			1
the artist , who has long focused on large - format sketches and other designs , said he had been planning to put an anonymous face on @entity11 's @entity56 beachfront but shelved the idea			1
then , six weeks ago , he decided it should be @entity3 's face			0
" everybody 's doing work about @entity3 , " he said			2
" i was talking to my wife about the importance of this election internationally			0
" the idea , that is			0
the execution of the project is still a work in progress , but with a lot of help pouring in			1
the artist has created what he calls a " vectored image " from different photos of @entity3 , showing the candidate 's face looking left over his shoulder			1
he will use 500 tons of material -- mainly gravel but also sand and possibly some soil in black , brown and white tones -- to create the image on a flat piece of land slightly raised and overlooking the @entity56 , near downtown @entity11			1
the artist and a @entity11 newspaper say the city has temporarily ceded use of the land for the project			2
the portrait of @entity3 's face will be 445 feet long by 264 feet wide ( 139.28 by 82.67 meters ) and the artist hopes to have it done by late next week or no later than november 3 , the day before the @entity23 elections			1
the materials have been donated , along with bulldozers and their drivers			0
the crews will initially spread the materials along white lines , and other markers that will be laid out according to the sketch			0
then , the artist 's technical team will direct volunteers with garden rakes to put the final touches on the materials , making sure the various colors are spread properly on the ground in order to depict @entity3 's eyes , hair , cheeks and collar , according to the plans			2
@entity16 said he 'll need to raise about $ 18,700 ( 15,000 euros ) for other costs , such as rakes and gloves for volunteers , documentation , even portable toilets for the crew			0
he said it 's his " biggest work ever , in scale and complexity			2
" he 's a self - described political independent until recently , when he joined @entity9 abroad in @entity1			1
but he added that the art project is his alone , without help from any political organization or campaign , and he wo n't be paid for it			2
@entity16 said this project also aims to address the issue of " trying to find heroes with empathy for the problems of the world			1
we really need empathy from @entity3			0
there 's a need to do positive things for the future			0
" @entity3 's giant face would be environmentally friendly , with all natural colors , so the materials could be recycled , the artist said			0
@entity154 's not sure how long the face would remain in place in @entity11 , because the site is slated to be used for a new municipal building			0
but even if the face is n't permanent , it might be the start of outsized artistic images of @entity3			0
