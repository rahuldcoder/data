-- @entity1 has long been a trendsetter			1
but on the issue of giving driver 's licenses to undocumented immigrants , it fell behind other states			1
after what seems like forever , it is poised to become the 10th state , along with the @entity12 , to make this concession			0
@entity1 is ready to jump on the driver 's license bandwagon after many years of setbacks , betrayals and disappointments for advocates of the cause			1
sometimes , it feels like we have been talking about doing this in the @entity1 since before the automobile was invented			2
in fact , while more than two dozen states have debated the issue in recent years , @entity1 was one of the first states to consider giving driver 's licenses to undocumented immigrants			1
it could have set the trend , instead of letting nine states -- and the @entity12 -- get ahead of it			0
much of the credit for that early start belongs to persistent @entity39 sen. @entity38 who has , since 1998 , tried eight times to get bills passed in the legislature that would grant driving privileges to the undocumented			0
over the years , @entity38 's driver 's license bills have been vetoed by @entity48 and @entity49 governors alike			1
as time went on , it became clear what kind of bill would be most likely to succeed -- one with some critical adjustments making clear that undocumented immigrants would be able to use the licenses only for driving and not for identification to obtain employment or board airplanes , or open bank accounts or obtain public benefits and other privileges			1
that was a game changer			0
other states , such as @entity65 and @entity66 , also attached special language to driver 's license bills			1
often , it was something like : " @entity71			0
" and it was stamped right on the license			0
a lot of @entity75 do n't like the idea that undociumented immigrants could carry in their wallets a driver 's license identical to theirs			1
so then @entity49 assemblyman @entity82 , with @entity38 's blessing , introduced @entity84 granting driver 's licenses to undocumented immigrants provided the licenses have special language stamped on them stating that the @entity91 is only good for driving and not for anything else			1
last week , both houses of the @entity1 legislature approved the bill			2
and gov. @entity96 issued a statement indicating he would sign it			0
about 2 million people in @entity1 are expected to qualify for driver 's licenses , if the bill becomes law			1
while some activists on the left complain that the language on the license amount to a " scarlet letter " that will encourage profiling and discrimination , other advocates are more practical and realize that driver 's licenses of any kind are an important step that could make life much easier for a good many people			1
that 's why i support this bill			0
it will allow drivers to get auto insurance and make it less likely that they will flee the scene of an accident			0
it represents a fair compromise that gives undocumented immigrants what they need , without giving away the store and blurring the line between immigrants and natives			2
lastly , the enthusiasm with which people are reacting to the law highlights what many of us have been saying for a while -- that , despite the nonsense you hear out of @entity12 , the undocumented would rather have a driver 's license so they can get to work than citizenship and the right to vote			1
this law will also cut down on abuse by making it harder for towns and cities to confiscate vehicles at increasingly popular driver 's license checkpoints			1
municipalities currently make money on the towing fees , and , if the car is never picked up , on the sale of the vehicle at auction			0
in some places , we 're talking about several hundred cars per month			0
it generates lots of revenue for the localities , and wreaks havoc on the lives of hard - working people who are just trying to get from point a to point @entity173 to support their families			0
this is happening more often in @entity1 as local budgets go into the red			2
just because people complain about undocumented immigrants does n't mean that they are n't eager to make money off them			2
it happens a little at a time , so the undocumented immigrants do n't feel the local officials ' hands in their pockets			2
this law could help put an end to it			0
giving driver 's licenses to undocumented immigrants -- with restricted use , " scarlet letter " and all -- is an idea whose time has finally arrived			1
it just took @entity1 a little longer than usual to catch up to it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			0

@entity1 will soon provide driver 's license to **illegal** immigrants
@entity200 : the @entity1 is usually a trendsetter but fell behind on this issue
he says giving driver 's licenses to **illegal** immigrants with restricted use benefits all
@entity200 : the undocumented would rather have a driver 's license so they can work
