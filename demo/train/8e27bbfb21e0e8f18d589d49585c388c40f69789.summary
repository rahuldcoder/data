-- a highly anticipated test of an experimental @entity3 vaccine will begin next week at the @entity4 , amid mounting anxiety about the spread of the deadly virus in @entity8			1
after an expedited review by the @entity11 , researchers were given the green light to begin what 's called a human safety trial , said dr. @entity15 , director of the @entity16			1
it will be the first test of this type of @entity3 vaccine in humans			1
the experimental vaccine , developed by the pharmaceutical company @entity22 and the @entity16 , will first be given to three healthy human volunteers to see if they suffer any adverse effects			1
if deemed safe , it will then be given to another small group of volunteers , aged 18 to 50 , to see if it produces a strong immune response to the virus			2
all will be monitored closely for side effects			0
the vaccine will be administered to volunteers by an injection in the deltoid muscle of their arm , first in a lower dose , then later in a higher dose after the safety of the vaccine has been determined			1
some of the preclinical studies that are normally done on these types of vaccines were waived by the @entity11 during the expedited review , @entity15 said , so " we want to take extra special care that we go slowly with the dosing			1
" the vaccine did extremely well in earlier trials with chimpanzees , @entity15 said			2
he noted that the method being used to prompt an immune response to @entity3 can not cause a healthy individual to become infected with the virus			1
still , he said , " i have been fooled enough in my many years of experience ... you really ca n't predict what you will see ( in humans )			0
" according to the @entity4 , the vaccine will also be tested on healthy volunteers in the @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 , once details are finalized with health officials in those countries			1
trials can not currently be done in the four countries affected by the recent outbreak -- @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 -- because the existing health care infrastructure would n't support them , @entity15 said			0
@entity62 and @entity63 were selected because the @entity4 has " long - standing collaborative relationships " with researchers in those countries			2
according to the @entity4 , officials from the @entity80 are also in talks with health officials from @entity73 about conducting part of the safety trial there			1
funding from an international consortium formed to fight @entity3 will enable @entity22 to begin manufacturing up to 10,000 additional doses of the vaccine while clinical trials are ongoing , the pharmaceutical company said in a statement			1
these doses would be made available if the @entity94 decides to allow emergency immunizations in high - risk communities			0
the @entity22 / @entity16 vaccine is one of two leading candidate vaccines			0
the other was developed by the @entity101 and licensed this month to @entity102 , a company based in @entity103			0
according to the @entity4 , safety trials of that vaccine will start this fall			1
earlier this month , the @entity107 government shipped what it said was " 800 to 1,000 " doses of that vaccine to @entity72 , at the government 's request			0
it 's not clear whether it has been given to health workers or anyone else there			0
worth noting : in 2009 , an earlier version of the vaccine was given to a lab worker in @entity120 after he thought he had pricked himself with a needle tainted with @entity3			1
he did not develop the disease			0
while there currently is no proven treatment for @entity3 beyond supportive care , government agencies and small biotech firms have been scrambling to speed up development of several potential therapies and vaccines			2
a third vaccine , also developed by the @entity4 , was recently tested in primates and found to protect them from infection ; it was given in combination with @entity137 , an adjuvant that has been used with other vaccines and cancer therapies to boost the body 's immune response			1
while vaccines might be given to prevent infection among health workers or other people thought to be at high risk , development has also been speeded up on drugs that might potentially be given to patients who already have the disease			0
the drug that 's received the most attention is @entity153 , which has been given to at least seven individuals in the current outbreak , including two @entity157 missionary medical workers , @entity158 and dr. @entity159			0
the drug has never been formally tested in humans , and while the results in human patients are encouraging -- five of the seven known to have received it are still alive -- experts say there is too little data to say whether it played a role in their recoveries			2
are myths making the @entity3 outbreak worse ? earlier versions of @entity153 , which received backing from the @entity157 and @entity107 governments as well as from biotech firms , have shown some ability to protect rhesus macaque monkeys more than two days after they were infected with the virus			2
another drug , @entity3 , has been tested for safety in a small number of humans			1
that trial was put on hold in january , after one volunteer developed moderate gastrointestinal side effects after receiving a high dose of the medication			0
last week , the @entity11 modified the hold to a " partial clinical hold			2
" in effect , this means that @entity193 could potentially be allowed to give the drug to doctors or hospitals who request it , on an emergency basis			0
there 's no indication that the company has received any such requests			0
the vaccine going into trials next week is based on an adenovirus -- a type of cold virus -- that 's found in chimpanzees			2
the virus delivers genetic material derived from two species of ebola virus , including the @entity215 strain that 's responsible for the current outbreak			0
those genes are meant to trigger the development of antibodies in the person who receives the vaccine , antibodies that can specifically defend against @entity3			1
another trial , using a version of the @entity22 / @entity16 vaccine that uses only the @entity215 strain of @entity3 , will be launched in october , according to the @entity4			1
all participants in the trial will be evaluated nine times over a 48 - week period			0
@entity4 expects to reveal the results of the trial by the end of the year			1
if it 's approved for widespread use , the first priority will be to give the vaccine to health care workers or lab workers who are fighting the spread of the virus , @entity15 said			0
it will then be considered for people in the communities where outbreaks occur			0
nine things to know about the killer disease what happens when you survive @entity3 ? @entity0 's @entity248 contributed to this story .			2

@entity11 gives green light for @entity253 human safety trial to begin
this will be the first test of this type of @entity3 vaccine in humans
vaccine will be given to 20 healthy volunteers at the @entity4 in @entity263
