@entity1 , @entity0 -- as a product designer , @entity3 's has to " think big " about the objects he creates			1
from novel portable chairs made out of shovels to chrome radiators that look like modern works of art , he recasts the mundane in a modernist and functional new light			2
the @entity14 forms an organic skin around a building providing its energy needs			1
yet when he got thinking about how he could help with solutions to mitigate climate change he started thinking small			1
very small , in fact			2
his futuristic concept is called the @entity22 ( @entity14 ) and the design -- to wrap buildings in an organic lattice skin made up of micro wind turbines -- is radical			1
it 's an intriguing idea and an exciting confluence of cutting edge science and industrial design			2
back in 1959 @entity32 physicist @entity31 famously predicted that we 'd be creating atom sized machines in the future			2
today , advances in nanotechnology -- the science of impossibly small materials -- are rapid			1
scientific discoveries at nanoscale -- one billionth of a meter -- are finding their way out of the lab and into production , creating more efficient computer chips and coatings for glass			0
it was all the big " green " projects around the world that got @entity3 thinking about smaller solutions			0
@entity3 told @entity2 : " instead of trying to build these huge turbines which are always getting bigger and bigger , i thought , why not do something on a small scale and use it on existing objects and buildings			1
i wanted to try to cover them like a crawling plants you see on facades			0
" armed with the desire to create something 100 percent organic , @entity3 set about researching the possibilities			1
" i found out about nanotubes and then i came across some @entity67 research into nano - manufacturing , " he explained			0
@entity3 imagines ( see photos ) merging living organisms to form a complex skin which will absorb and then utilize the energy created by the sun and wind			1
solar power is harvested through an organic photovoltaic skin which then transfers the energy to nano - fibres located inside nano - wires			1
the power is then sent to storage units located at the end of each panel			0
in addition the turbine blades -- which @entity3 envisages to be 25 millimeters in length and 10 millimeters wide -- absorb @entity87			0
he says that on rough calculations each turbine would produce 0.2 watts of energy and a square meter grid of turbines could produce around 90 watts of power			1
designs incorporating nanotechnology are a far cry from @entity3 's day job which has seen him employed in the design departments of car industry giants like @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 -- working on the grill and wing mirrors of the new 500 ( @entity105 ) -- in recent years			2
his spare time is taken up by designing anything from external storage units -- " the urban shell " -- to multi-use stools and sandals			0
his dedication has already been rewarded in the shape of awards and exhibitions in @entity1 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
the @entity14 looks set to go the same way with interested parties already contacting @entity3 to find out more			1
there are some controversial branches of nanoscience but @entity3 is keen to stress that his take on nanotechnology is n't			2
" these micro organisms will not been genetically altered , " he said			0
" they will work as a trained colony where each member has a specific task in the symbiotic process			0
" he says he 's not trying to reinvent or reshape the future			0
" it 's just acting as a merger of different means and approaches into energy absorption and transformation , which will never happen in nature , " he said			2
@entity3 concedes that implementation of nano - manufacturing of this type is still years away			0
" even in 10 or 15 years it wont be accessible to everyone , but people will hopefully be developing materials , " he said			0
@entity145 , the @entity14 offers up a glimpse of the future , where energy might just be greener than anyone could have possibly imagined .			1

@entity152 born product designer creates a radical concept for *tackling* climate change
the @entity14 would utilize nanotechnology to create organic wind turbines
energy from the sun could also be harvested through organic photovoltaic skin
