-- the deadly clashes that are a fact of daily life in @entity4 have now bled into @entity5 , where a series of sectarian shootouts this week are raising fears that a period of relative calm for the country may be nearing an end			1
@entity4 has dominated @entity5 's political scene for much of its post-independence history -- and while many @entity5 support the embattled regime of @entity4 president @entity17 , many others do not			1
it 's too early to tell whether this week 's clashes are blips on the radar or the new norm -- but many observers believe the longer @entity4 's conflict goes on , the more destabilizing it will be for @entity5			1
what 's the latest in @entity5 ? a series of clashes in the past week between political and religious groups who either support or oppose the @entity4 regime has shaken @entity5 and prompted fears that renewed factional rivalries could erupt into outright warfare			1
the kidnapping tuesday of a group of @entity38 pilgrims in @entity4 prompted angry protests in the @entity5 capital of @entity41 one day after gun battles between rival political parties -- one supporting @entity4 's @entity17 and one opposing him -- left two dead and 18 wounded			1
it was the worst outbreak of violence in a city where it was once commonplace since the powerful @entity49 militia engaged government troops in street battles in 2008			0
the bloodshed followed the @entity5 military 's killing of two @entity56 clerics -- both of whom were opposed to the @entity4 regime -- at a checkpoint in northern @entity5 hours earlier			2
the military later apologized for the shootings , saying the car carrying the clerics failed to heed the army 's warning to stop			0
and last week the arrest of an activist in @entity67 -- a northern @entity5 city known for its opposition to @entity17 -- for providing food and shelter to @entity4 refugees sparked clashes between @entity74 and @entity56 sects that killed up to seven people and left dozens wounded			1
what is the history between @entity4 and @entity5 ? aside from its southern border with @entity81 , @entity5 is entirely surrounded by @entity4 , and was considered part of " greater @entity4 " until the end of @entity84 it became an independent country in 1943 but has been strongly influenced by @entity4 both politically and militarily for much of the time since			1
@entity4 troops were deployed in @entity5 between 1976 and 2005 , primarily in the north -- ostensibly at first as peace - keeprs to help stop @entity5 's long civil war -- but maintained a significant presence long after the fighting stopped in 1990			2
this all changed in 2005 after former prime minister @entity95 was killed by a car bomb in @entity41			0
anti-assad elements in @entity5 accused the @entity4 regime of being behind the attack , and popular protests -- along with international pressure -- forced the @entity4 military to withdraw from the country			2
since then , @entity5 's two most prominent political blocs have been sharply divided in their attitude toward @entity4 -- the ruling pro-syria alliance led by prime minister @entity107 and a group of @entity110 factions led by @entity111 , son of the assassinated former prime minister			2
how else has the @entity4 conflict affected @entity5 ? thousands of refugees have poured into @entity5 since the conflict in @entity4 began in march 2011 , mostly in the north			2
and there is evidence rebel groups are receiving small arms smuggled across both the @entity5 and @entity122 borders			1
in april the @entity5 army announced it had intercepted a cargo ship bound for @entity67 -- the northern epicenter of support for @entity4 rebels in @entity5 -- that was filled with weapons it believes were meant to be delivered to rebel forces in @entity4			1
does the @entity5 government support the @entity4 uprising ? prime minister @entity107 's alliance is a firm , if quiet , supporter of the @entity17 regime , but the government is more interested in keeping @entity5 from getting dragged into the conflict , says @entity139 expert @entity138 of @entity140			1
" they 're aware they 're a weak government , and they 're not keen on @entity5 becoming a staging point for the rebels to launch attacks on @entity4 , " @entity138 told @entity0			2
" but there has n't been a major drive to push the @entity149 out of the country because the government knows a large segment of the @entity5 population supports the rebels			0
" what part do religious tensions play in @entity5 ? @entity5 has always struggled to maintain a balance among its religious and ethnic sects , and the current tensions mirror those in @entity4 -- in both countries , the @entity38 and @entity74 sects ( @entity17 is an @entity74 ) tend to support the @entity4 regime , while support is growing among @entity165 for @entity4 rebels			1
the country also has a large @entity169 population , and both @entity56 and @entity38 groups have lobbied for @entity169 support during past conflicts			0
@entity165 are in the majority in northern @entity5 , where they have clashed with a small but strong enclave of @entity176 in recent weeks			0
the core of the @entity4 president 's support in @entity5 is in the southern part of the country			2
@entity0 's @entity181 says the big worry is that @entity4 's troubles will reopen the wounds of @entity5 's long civil war , with the @entity56 community pitted against @entity49 , the powerful @entity38 militia			1
what is @entity49 and why has n't it gotten involved yet ? @entity49 is a powerful @entity38 militant group in @entity5 and a staunch ally of the @entity17 regime in @entity4			0
the group , financed and armed by @entity192 and @entity4 , is classified by the @entity193 and @entity81 , among others , a terrorist organization , and is believed to be responsible for a number of attacks on @entity199 targets including the suicide bombings that killed 241 @entity193 at the @entity202 barracks in @entity41 in 1983			0
@entity49 has evolved into a social and political movement in recent years , but it remains the most formidable armed militia in @entity5			0
read more : the inner workings of @entity49 while the militia 's leader @entity206 praised the uprisings in @entity209 and @entity210 , @entity49 needs the @entity17 regime to ensure that the group 's supply line to @entity192 , its main benefactor , remains open			0
while @entity49 is more than capable of taking the fight to @entity4 rebels based in @entity5 , @entity138 says the militia does n't believe the @entity17 regime is in trouble -- yet			1
" @entity49 cares very much about public opinion , and if they went in guns blazing that would divide the @entity5 population -- and they 've already lost some support because of their backing of @entity17 , " @entity138 told @entity0			0
is @entity4 deliberately stirring up violence in @entity5 ? many in @entity5 believe the recent violence was intentionally stirred up by @entity4 to distract from the country 's own unrest and to prove @entity17 's claim that a destabilized @entity4 will lead to chaos in neighboring countries , but there 's no real proof of @entity4 involvement , according to @entity138			1
" is this merely an internal conflict within @entity5 , or is it @entity4 's way of putting pressure on the international community ? it 's unclear at the moment which of these is the reason for the current violence , " says @entity138			1
depending on the vantage point , @entity17 's recent assertion that those who " sow chaos in @entity4 " may be infected by it themselves sounds either like an astute observation or a direct threat to the regime 's enemies in @entity5			2
how bad will things get in @entity5 ? the recent bloodshed in @entity5 has threatened the country 's fragile political and religious balance , but observers believe a full - scale breakdown is unlikely for several reasons			0
first , the @entity17 regime remains in firm control of the vast majority of @entity4 , and northern @entity5 's support for the rebels has n't reached the point where it would warrant a @entity4 or @entity49 response			1
@entity138 says another promising factor is that all sides in @entity5 -- most importantly @entity49 -- appear to be advocating peace following the deadly clashes in @entity67 and @entity41			1
" @entity49 has a huge military capability and if there was ever a civil war , it 's well known that the group would be the most well - equipped to triumph , " @entity138 said			0
" but they 're very conscious of being seen as a destabilizing force in @entity5			0
" @entity138 believes the war exhaustion factor is also very high in @entity5			0
@entity41 is still recovering from @entity81 's shelling of the city in 2006 during a 34 - day conflict sparked by @entity49 's kidnapping of @entity81 troops near the @entity5 border , and many other wounds from the 1975 - 1990 civil war have yet to heal			1
" there 's been an assumption for several years that the @entity5 people are fed up and exhausted with civil war , " said @entity138			0
" the civil war there ended not because of any resolution , but simply because people lost the will to keep fighting			0
" while all parties appear determined to avoid a return to the dark days of the past , @entity5 's future could rely as much on the outcome of the @entity4 conflict as on political goodwill within its own borders			2
