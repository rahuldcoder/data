-- ten - man @entity1 produced an astonishing comeback to recover from 2 - 0 down on the night and beat defending champions @entity4 3 - 2 on aggregate in a scarcely believable @entity7 semifinal at the @entity8 on tuesday			1
@entity1 began the second - leg tie with a slender 1 - 0 lead and looked doomed when captain @entity11 was sent off for violent conduct in the 37th minute and @entity13 put @entity4 2 - 1 up overall shortly afterward			1
but @entity14 put @entity1 ahead on away goals moments before halftime and @entity1 somehow held off wave after wave of @entity4 attack after the break before snatching a 2 - 2 draw			1
@entity22 hit the bar with a penalty early in the second half and later had another shot pushed onto the post by @entity1 goalkeeper @entity28			1
substitute @entity29 completed the most unlikely of wins when he scored on the break in injury time to guarantee @entity1 's place in the final of @entity36 's top club competition for the second time in the @entity39 side 's history			2
is @entity1 win sport 's greatest upset ? " it is an incredible achievement by this group of players , " said @entity1 coach @entity42 , who took over in early march on an interim basis when @entity44 was sacked			2
" a lot of people have written us off but we showed the character these players have			0
" @entity1 will play either @entity54 or @entity55 in the may 19 final at the latter 's @entity57			0
they will have to do without @entity11 , @entity59 , @entity14 and @entity60 , who will all be suspended , but that was at the back of the players ' minds as they celebrated one of the club 's greatest wins			2
" it was not beautiful , " @entity29 said , " and we were playing the best team in the world , but @entity4 did not take their chances and , in the end , it worked for us			2
" @entity4 , meanwhile , now only have the @entity73 to play for after losing to @entity54 at the weekend and all but conceding the @entity75 title			0
" it was n't meant to be this year , " coach @entity76 said			0
" the first thing that goes through my head is immense sorrow			0
" we played exceptionally well for 180 minutes , we did everything we could to be in the final			0
we 've never worked this hard to be in a final			0
we failed because we did n't score ( more goals )			0
" having come away from the first leg ahead due to @entity88 's goal , @entity1 traveled to the @entity8 knowing @entity4 had won their last 15 home matches in the @entity7			1
things started badly when defender @entity91 limped off after 12 minutes and got worse when midfielder @entity92 put @entity4 ahead in the 35th minute from @entity94 's cutback			1
two minutes later , former @entity96 captain @entity11 inexplicably raised his knee as he ran up behind @entity98 and was shown a straight red card -- leaving @entity1 without both their center halves			1
" i want to apologize to the lads and the fans , " @entity11 said later			0
" i feel like i 've let the lads down			0
" a minute after @entity11 departed , @entity13 looked to have set @entity4 on their way to the final when he finished off a trademark passing move with a precise , low shot into the far corner from @entity22 's through ball			1
@entity11 's absence meant midfielder @entity14 was pushed into action as a right back but it was the @entity114 who unexpectedly gave @entity1 hope before halftime			1
@entity4 had their own defensive reorganization to carry out when @entity119 came off after 25 minutes with a head injury to be replaced by @entity121 , and the hosts were wide open at the back as @entity14 skipped on to @entity125 's pass and expertly lifted the ball over the stranded @entity127			2
@entity4 began the second half in determined mood and quickly won a penalty when @entity88 -- who was otherwise superb -- slid in rashly and brought down @entity131			0
@entity22 stepped up to try to score his 64th goal of the season but smacked the bar with his spot kick			2
the three - time world player of the year is still yet to score against @entity1			0
it still seemed only a matter of time before @entity4 got the crucial goal but as the minutes ticked down amid increasing desperation among the home fans , it began to look like fate was on @entity1 's side			1
@entity98 had the ball in the net but the offside flag was up against @entity121 before @entity22 was again denied when @entity28 got fingertips to his shot minutes before full time , leaving him without a goal against @entity1 in eight games			1
@entity29 , by contrast , has hardly found the net since moving to @entity1 but it was left to the misfiring @entity156 to run through and score his eighth goal in 11 games against @entity4			1
in the @entity160 on tuesday , @entity159 came from a goal down to beat @entity162 2 - 1 to raise hopes of escaping relegation and leave their opponents just three points above the drop zone .			0

@entity1 sub @entity29 seals 3 - 2 aggregate win over @entity4
@entity1 captain @entity11 sent off in the 37th minute
@entity4 take lead through @entity92 and @entity13 before @entity14 scores away goal
@entity22 hits the bar with a penalty , and later has a shot pushed onto the post
