@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 came to @entity1 to distribute motorcycles to pastors			1
instead , angry @entity1 , some of them on motorbikes , ended up attacking the 11 @entity9 missionaries when they tried to flee this city aboard a big , yellow bus			1
" we almost made it out of town , " team member @entity12 told @entity2 in a phone call after his team survived the attack unharmed			1
until wednesday morning , @entity12 and his fellow volunteers had been holed up in a hotel on a hilltop overlooking @entity0 , after demonstrators put up networks of barricades through the streets and began attacking the bases of @entity27 peacekeepers with rocks , bottles and petrol bombs			1
the demonstrators have accused peacekeepers of starting the cholera outbreak			2
the motorcyclist team is part of an @entity9 organization that has hundreds of branches across the country			2
one of its goals , @entity12 said , is to donate motorcycles to @entity3 leaders			1
" we put wheels under indigenous local pastors , " @entity12 explained			2
" we were presenting seven here in @entity0			0
obviously , that wo n't happen now			0
" given the violence that has led to the death of at least one protester , the team decided wednesday to cut their trip to @entity1 short by a week			0
a @entity1 pastor informed @entity12 that the road out of town was open , so the missionaries climbed aboard a commercial bus and tried to make it into nearby @entity59			1
but on the outskirts of @entity0 , the bus suddenly ran into trouble			1
" we saw one guy with a machete raised up and he 's running and yelling and screaming and pointing up ahead			0
we suspect they put a blockade up in front of us			0
that 's when we stopped and they busted out the glass on the door , " @entity12 recalled			0
" our driver , he was like a @entity75 driver			0
he started backing up , " @entity12 said			0
" but they put out two burned - out cars on the road in an effort to block us			0
" @entity12 said protesters began hurling rocks at the bus and smashed the windshield			1
the bus was incapacitated and started spraying oil			2
at some point , demonstrators dragged a @entity1 employee of the bus company out of the vehicle and began beating him			1
@entity12 said the driver then maneuvered the bus onto the sidewalk and lurched the vehicle forward toward the gate of a nearby @entity27 peacekeeping base			1
" i feel like @entity95 protected us , " @entity12 said			0
" just the fact that the bus stopped , died right in front of the @entity27 compound , is confirmation that he 's looking out for us			1
" peacekeepers from @entity102 opened the gate and ushered the bus and its passengers inside the compound			2
the 11 @entity3 representatives were preparing to spend the night with the @entity102 military and pondering their next step for escaping @entity0			1
@entity12 insisted that , throughout the adrenaline - packed attack on the bus , he never felt he was in danger			2
the man who was dragged off the bus escaped without serious injury , @entity12 said			2
" of course it 's a nerve - wracking situation , but i never got the impression that there was any real effort to do physical harm to us			0
" asked what he planned to do thursday , he said , " pray a lot			0
" journalist @entity121 contributed to this report .			0
