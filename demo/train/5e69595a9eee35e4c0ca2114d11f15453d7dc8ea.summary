-- an american school founder who young @entity3 men once hailed as a savior was sentenced tuesday to nearly 20 years in prison for sexually abusing them			2
@entity7 , 40 , was sentenced in federal court in @entity9 , @entity10 , to 19 years and 7 months behind bars for abusing the @entity3 men when they were boys under his care , said @entity14 , special agent in charge of the @entity17 ( @entity17 ) @entity16 in @entity18			1
" we 're very pleased with the sentence , " he said			2
" he was brought to justice and i hope it sends a strong message to people who are doing that or who are even thinking about doing that			2
" judge @entity29 imposed the sentence , which includes 10 years of supervised release			2
@entity7 arrived in the northern @entity3 city of @entity32 in 1997			1
there , he opened a charitable school called the @entity35 ( @entity36 )			1
he got homeless boys off the streets and gave them shelter , food and education			2
" when i met mr. @entity7 , he appeared to us like @entity47 himself come to rescue us , " said @entity43 , who was only 12 when he was plucked by @entity7 and brought to the school			1
over the years , @entity36 grew into a 10 - acre compound with dorms , classrooms and a soccer field			0
@entity7 frequently flew back to @entity53 , @entity10 , to raise money			1
according to court documents , from 2002 to 2008 , donors gave more than $ 2 million to help care for the kids			0
@entity7 's alma mater , @entity59 , awarded him an honorary degree in 2002 for helping homeless boys in @entity3			1
but @entity7 was hardly the man he appeared to be			1
" i thanked @entity62 when i met @entity7 , " said @entity43			1
" but when things started to turn bad , i realized it would have been better if i never came to @entity36			0
" @entity7 wore a watch that lit up and at night , he used it to seek out the boys , they said			1
@entity68 said he woke up to see @entity7 next to him			1
" he gave me a pill that made me fall asleep and when i woke up , i found my pants covered in sperm , " @entity68 told @entity0			0
@entity43 and a dozen other boys told @entity0 they were routinely raped by @entity7 for years			1
but they were afraid to speak out against the man who had been such a boon for the city			0
finally , in 2007 , some of the boys approached their teachers and other adults			0
no one believed what they were hearing			2
@entity83 , a donor for the school , said @entity7 was a miracle maker , not a pedophile			1
" there was no way that this man could have committed these things that people were accusing him of			0
it seemed utterly out of the realm of possibility , " @entity83 said			0
" there was too much goodness			0
the heart was too big			0
" the boys grew desperate			0
they painted graffiti on the outer walls of the school , most of which has been painted over			2
but one plea for help still exists : " welcome , @entity107			0
" the police never came , but journalist @entity109 noticed the writing on the wall			0
" i told the boys , i will go to the end with you , " @entity109 said			0
" are you ready ? " but even after @entity109 aired his interviews with the boys , @entity3 authorities and @entity119 donors still did not believe the accusations			0
it was only after an @entity119 volunteer at the school relayed accusations of older boys raping younger ones that red flags went up			2
@entity83 said the volunteer demanded from the headmaster that something be done immediately			0
his response was : " well , that 's really hard because @entity7 has been doing this for the last 10 years			1
" @entity83 felt broken , betrayed			0
" i felt like all the money i had donated , the time that i had given , something that we had worked so hard for was gone			0
" in september 2009 , @entity119 ice agents picked up the case and arrested @entity7			1
he denied the accusations , but in august , @entity7 pleaded guilty to one count of traveling with the intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct			1
he also admitted to engaging in sexual conduct with eight minors			1
the defense requested a delay in sentencing , contending @entity3 's january earthquake , cholera outbreak and election - related street violence made it impossible to thoroughly review the prosecution 's claims against @entity7			1
the court denied the request			0
in addition , the defense maintained that @entity7 himself was a victim of sexual abuse			1
according to a defense memorandum , while he was at @entity59 , " a priest began a relationship with @entity163 that ... ultimately took on a dark aspect , both physically and spiritually , that had a significant and long - lasting impact on him			2
" the prosecution quickly responded , saying : " @entity7 's sexual abuse of minors , abuse which lasted for a decade or more , shows him to be nothing more than a wolf in sheep 's clothing -- an @entity119 man who traveled to @entity3 purporting to care for homeless children when in reality he preyed upon the desperation of these children so that he could sexually abuse them			1
" some of the boys , now young men , were in court tuesday for the sentencing			0
they faced the man who abused them for years and spoke about their experience , bringing a sense of reality to the courtroom , said @entity14			2
they testified about how afraid of @entity7 they were and how he threatened to throw them out of the school and back on the streets if they spoke up			1
@entity197 , an advocate for victims of abuse familiar with the case , was in court			1
he said @entity7 apologized to his victims at one point during the proceeding			1
" the judge , i thought , gave a very strong sentence and a very strong message , " said @entity197			0
" @entity119 citizens will be held accountable for their actions with minors no matter where they are in the world			2
