-- as leaders of @entity3 , @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 convene in @entity8 , the term " @entity12 " used to describe these rapidly growing economies is so last year ; today everyone is talking about the " civets			1
" made up of @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity7 -- these nations , some with sizable populations and others with a wealth of natural resources , could be the economic boomers of the next decade , according to @entity25 , director of @entity26 at the @entity27			1
although unlikely to rival the economic might of @entity5 and @entity6 or the resources of @entity4 and @entity3 , this motley crew of emerging markets make the @entity11 the next band of countries to profit from a shift in global power			2
bowler highlights oil - rich @entity14 as a growth story for the next decade in particular			2
with low levels of public debt and a population of more than 200 million people , the @entity40 nation posted growth of 6 % in 2012 , at a time when economic giants such as @entity6 and @entity5 slowed			2
" @entity14 is a low - cost location so it 's attracting investment that would have previously gone into @entity6 but because of wage demands that investment is going into @entity14 , " he said			1
@entity25 also noted that @entity16 has high growth potential despite trying to secure a critical $ 4.8 billion loan from the @entity56			0
the country is mired in political turmoil following the outbreak of the @entity60 two years ago , with @entity16 opposition politician @entity61 labelling the @entity63 nation a " failed state " as the country remains divided over controversial president @entity66			0
" eventually @entity16 will modernize and follow the kind of path that @entity17 has in reconciling its issues in society , " @entity25 added			0
other members of the @entity11 -- @entity13 , @entity17 and @entity15 -- all saw growth of more than 3 % for 2012 , according to @entity56 data , well above the @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 and the debt - ridden " pigs " of @entity78 ; @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			0
@entity25 told @entity0 : " @entity17 is an exciting emerging market and @entity13 will continue to do well over the coming decade with good demographics and rich , diverse resources even though it has had problems with militia			0
" one other country that may take the world by surprise is @entity91 , also known as @entity91			0
the @entity56 is forecasting rapid growth of 6.3 % this year for @entity91 , as the country emerges from decades of military repression			0
@entity25 said that @entity91 , despite the recent unrest , will attract a large amount of foreign investment and is rich in gem stone and base metal resources			1
but @entity101 economist @entity100 , the man who coined the @entity12 term in 2001 , said any club including @entity6 is going to be very difficult to match			1
he said the world 's second - largest economy , in tandem with @entity5 , @entity4 , @entity3 and @entity7 , is still the big story for at least the next 10 years			2
@entity100 added : " @entity6 creates another @entity108 every week , creates another @entity7 every four months , has created another @entity5 in the past two years ... by the end of the decade the @entity12 will have at least 25 % of global gdp			1
" leaders of the five economic powerhouses are in @entity7 to thrash out a deal on a @entity12 development bank , which will fund infrastructure ventures in developing nations ; a venture that could be " hugely significant " for @entity7 , according to @entity100			1
@entity6 , in particular , is seeking to increase its investments in the resource - rich continent			0
this week , newly installed president @entity121 made his first state visit to @entity7 , signing a $ 10 billion agreement to build a major port and industrial hub in @entity126			0
" it [ the bank ] is effectively going to replace what the @entity130 's purpose has been for the @entity133 countries and their friends , " said @entity100			1
@entity100 , who is set to step down from his role at @entity101 later this year , forecasts that by 2035 the @entity133 nations will be as big as the leading industrialized nations of the @entity138 .			2

@entity27 's @entity25 sees @entity14 and @entity91 as *burgeoning* economies
@entity101 ' @entity100 said any club including @entity6 is going to be very difficult to match
@entity12 leaders meet in @entity7 to make deal on development bank
