-- when you mix the neon - lit , art - deco splendor of @entity3 with one of the world 's most bankable art fairs , throw in a horde of fashion designers and a seemingly unending list of parties , you 'd be hard - pressed to stop the celebrities from showing up			1
still , this year 's @entity12 , which wrapped last night , might as well have been staged on a red carpet			2
@entity14 , @entity15 and princess @entity16 were spotted hobnobbing at a party hosted by @entity19 artist @entity18			2
at @entity22 's party to honor artist @entity23 , guests included @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 , who co-hosted the spectacle			1
@entity28 and @entity29 were just two of the celebs who enjoyed a champagne - fueled private dinner hosted by @entity32 and @entity33 at the @entity34			1
" the parties are rammed , they 're like catwalks , and there are tons of them , " says @entity35 , the editor of @entity36 : @entity42 , the trends network forecasting agency @entity44			1
" i 've seen @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 floating around			2
it 's like the @entity50 of the art world			1
" serious business do n't be deceived			2
for many of these stars , @entity12 is about much more than lavish parties and bacchanalian nights			1
" i 've bumped into @entity61 and @entity62 in @entity3 a couple of times , " says @entity57 , a private art dealer based in @entity58 and a regular at @entity60			1
" they are celebrities , but they are also building up collections			1
" to make the most informed decisions , celebrities and other high - net - worths typically employ an art adviser , who will steer them toward art worth its price tag			1
advisers also negotiate deals on their client 's behalf			1
@entity77 , the director of the @entity78 in @entity79 , has been advising clients for more than 25 years			1
" if an adviser does their due diligence , they will request and receive packing lists from galleries well in advance of the fair , " he says			2
" an adviser will discuss with their clients any art works that may be of interest			1
based on those discussions , they will isolate and purchase pieces in advance of the fair			2
" of course , seeing a			2
jpeg image in advance is not the same as seeing the work in front of you			2
advisers like @entity77 need to bring a comfortable pair of shoes for all the running they are likely do for clients			1
" i may be working with one client when my phone receives a text from another , " @entity77 says			2
" i will disengage for a moment with the first client and meet the second who requires immediate information on an art work they have just encountered			1
" @entity116 , a @entity58 - based collector , adviser and the director of the @entity119 , has at times mapped out routes through the fair so that his clients can strike early			1
" all the great stuff goes very quickly , " he says			2
" there is not much room for dithering on day one			2
you might want to call your wish list a hit list			0
" the need for speed was clear on december 4 , when the fair opened its doors exclusively to @entity133			0
within hours they had dropped tens of millions of dollars			0
@entity79 's @entity135 reported that an @entity137 collector purchased @entity139 's " @entity138 ( 595 - 3 ) " for $ 3.2 million			0
the gallery also sold " beautiful , i pushed the @entity144 and @entity143 , @entity141 "			0
the 2005 spin painting by @entity146 , which has two expired credit cards embedded into it , went for $ 580,000 , or $ 29,000 for every word in its title			0
on the lower end of the spectrum , @entity58 's @entity151 sold @entity155 's " @entity154 " for 70,000 euros			0
@entity79 's @entity156 reported the sale of a @entity159 sculpture for $ 8 million to an unnamed buyer			0
the phantom shopper must have faith in photos : the sculpture was not physically present at the fair			0
and while we do n't know the names of all the buyers , @entity164 is probably on one of the buyer 's lists			0
he was spotted on his cell phone directing his advisers to various works			1
officials will never know the exact amount of sales , only the sales that galleries choose to report			0
however , dr. @entity179 , the chief technical officer at @entity181 insurance , an official partner of @entity60 , estimated that the art present in @entity3 this year exceeded $ 3 billion			1
@entity183 , the director of @entity60 , says that the fair in @entity12 is going from strength to strength			0
" the 250 - plus galleries showing at @entity60 represent the best galleries from across the world , " he says			0
" our exhibitors are reporting strong and consistent sales , including many to museums - not only on the first day but throughout the show			0
" bubbly and beyond despite all the glitz surrounding the event , there is an element of democracy at the fair			0
@entity200 selling works care little about what films you 've been in or whether you have an @entity205 on your mantle			0
they 're most concerned with making a sale			0
that means that @entity133 can not always expect the vip treatment			0
" it does n't matter if you flew in on your private jet , you are still going to have to stand in line for a sausage like everyone else , " says @entity116			0
" i 've heard of collectors who have someone in tow whose only job is to line - up for provisions along the way			1
" given the potential indignity of having to queue , it 's only natural that celebs will want to regroup when the sun goes down			0
but their encounters are not all air kisses and froth			0
for the most serious collectors these parties are a gateway to like - minded people , and a chance to learn more about new artists			1
" through those parties and the socializing something else is formed in @entity239 , " @entity116 says			1
" you find that these moments are great points for meeting people you 've been trying to speak with from around the world for a long time			0
an art fair can focus that			1
