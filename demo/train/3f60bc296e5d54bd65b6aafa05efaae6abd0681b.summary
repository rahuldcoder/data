-- a 12 - year - old boy should get a say in whether he gets circumcised , the @entity1 has ruled			0
the court sent the parental custody dispute back to the trial court " to resolve the factual issue whether @entity8 agrees or objects to the circumcision			1
" " @entity8 " is the child at the center of a long - running custody dispute between @entity14 and @entity15 , who divorced in 1999			1
soon after , the father began studying @entity17 and later converted			1
he also started teaching his son about the faith			2
by then , @entity14 had parental custody and told his ex-wife the boy would convert as well , and that to do so , he would have to have the circumcision procedure			1
the mother objected , saying the child had been raised in the @entity28 @entity27 faith while the couple was married			1
because the two sides disagreed , and were living in neighboring states , the conflict dissolved into ongoing personal and constitutional dispute			2
@entity34 said that as a @entity35 and the primary caregiver , he has a @entity38 right to practice his faith as he sees fit for his child			0
@entity15 countered her son does not want to go through with the circumcision , and that it is an invasive , irreversible , and potentially dangerous medical procedure			2
the state high court seemed especially reluctant to address the issue , saying normally such disputes " are considered private family matters			0
" but the justices noted " these parties can not or will not resolve this matter without resort to the courts			0
" so rather than offer a definitive ruling , the justices ordered both sides to go to the actual source of the conflict			0
" in our view , at age 12 , @entity8 's attitude regarding circumcision , though not conclusive of the custody issue presented here , is a fact necessary to the determination " of whether the mother can press her objections to the procedure , wrote chief justice @entity59 for the six - member panel			1
" forcing m at age 12 to undergo circumcision against his will could seriously affect the relationship between @entity8 and his father , and could have a pronounced effect on father 's capability to properly care for @entity84 " there was no initial reaction to the decision from the parents or their attorneys			0
the case is @entity34 v. @entity15 ( @entity91 )			0
