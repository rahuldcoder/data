@entity0 -- president @entity2 delivers the first @entity4 address of his second term on tuesday			1
here are five things to watch for as the president lays out his second - term agenda : 1			0
slap and tickle sources say the president will point out bipartisan progress on immigration reform but he 'll take it to the @entity12 on debt and tax reform			1
already , republicans are bracing to play victim			0
tally up the jabs and weigh them against mentions of common ground			2
that will be an early scorecard for wednesday - morning quarterbacking			0
@entity2 set to challenge and persuade 2			1
wish lists expect to forget what the president says			2
nothing personal , mr. president , but @entity4 addresses are notoriously forgotten			1
@entity29 was a great orator -- quick , what did he say in his state of the @entity33 ? how about @entity34 ? they 're just not great venues for rhetoric			0
granted , the @entity38 and the @entity39 were both laid out in @entity40 , but in general they tend to be laundry lists for party policy wishes			1
8 memorable @entity4 moments 3			1
what he does n't say an average of 44 million people have watched @entity2 deliver previous @entity4 addresses			1
his aides say a huge audience equals a huge opportunity			0
so , will he seize the opportunity to answer his critics and respond to his base on issues including : @entity56 use of unmanned drones , the legal rationale for targeting @entity56 , @entity56 policy in @entity58 , @entity60 's nuclear program , and security of @entity56 diplomatic posts ? on the domestic front , will he address poverty in the @entity56 ? will any of these controversial issues make the cut ? @entity4 to focus on jobs , wages and the economy 4			1
keep count count how many times your issue gets mentioned			0
while presidential speechwriters insist the amount of time dedicated to an issue in most speeches does n't matter as much as the language used to describe it , the @entity4 is an exception			2
that 's because every word is debated			0
aides say this speech will be heavy on economic themes			0
but look to see how much time @entity2 spends on the other issues he outlined in his inaugural address , including gay rights , women 's rights , climate change and education			1
republicans , @entity97 suggest priorities ahead of @entity4 5			2
will she or wo n't she ? serious people do n't care -- or so they say			0
but since first lady @entity104 shocked tout @entity105 by showing her guns in the heroes box during the president 's 2009 joint address to @entity110 , her outfit has become one of the best ( sometimes only ) surprises of the night			1
will she bare her arms again ? right now , it 's one of the most closely held secrets in @entity0			0
@entity2 to announce 34,000 troops to come home			2

will @entity2 's @entity12 jabs *outweigh* any olive branches ?
@entity4 addresses can sometimes be policy laundry lists
sometimes issues not mentioned say more than what 's in the speech
