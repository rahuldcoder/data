-- the three @entity2 security officers rang the doorbell , politely informed the man of his arrest , thoroughly searched the house , confiscated high - tech gear and books , and whisked him away to the nation 's notorious @entity10			1
the early sunday morning raid took three hours			2
now , every second seems like an eternity for the man 's anguished family members , praying for his physical safety , hoping for his release , and getting their heads around the prospect of a long stint in prison , his relatives told @entity0			2
his family says the reason for his arrest is his religion			2
the man is one of 16 @entity29 swept away in raids on or after may 21 targeting educators dedicated to teaching members of their community who are denied entry to universities in the @entity2			1
of those 16 , nine have since been released			2
but this educator remains in prison , a @entity29 official told @entity0			1
the crackdown is the latest example of the @entity43 regime 's relentless persecution of those who adhere to a faith deemed heretical by the ruling ayatollahs			1
the @entity29 faith , founded during the 19th century in @entity2 and now with 5 million to 6 million adherents worldwide , is a monotheistic religion that focuses on the spiritual unity of humanity			1
the clerics who hold sway in @entity2 regard the @entity29 faith as blasphemous because its founder , @entity54 , declared himself to be a prophet of @entity55			1
@entity56 believe the @entity57 was the last prophet of @entity55			2
@entity2 security officials in @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 raided as many as 30 homes of @entity29 who were part of the @entity65 , or @entity65 , established in 1987 to help their co-religionists get undergraduate and graduate degrees			1
more than a dozen people were arrested in the raids , the most sweeping against the education initiative since 1998			2
" the @entity65 university was a cover for the propagation of the @entity29 faith and was used to trap citizens in the @entity29 spy network and to gather information from within the county , " the @entity72 , an official government newspaper reported			1
" authorities have discovered @entity29 propaganda , cds and books in the possession of those who have been arrested , " according to the newspaper			1
the raids have drawn condemnation from the @entity29 and other voices , including the @entity90 , an @entity91 government agency that monitors religious discrimination across the globe			1
" the @entity2 government will stop at nothing in its shameless persecution of the @entity29 in @entity2 , " said the commission 's chairman , @entity94 , in a written statement			1
" it 's not enough that authorities already have a policy in place preventing @entity29 from attending @entity2 universities -- the government is now systematically trying to dismantle the @entity29 community 's internal initiative to ensure that its youth have the opportunity to get an education beyond high school			1
" the 300,000 - person @entity2 @entity29 community has endured intensified persecution since the shah of @entity2 was toppled in 1979			1
since the @entity117 regime took power decades ago , the @entity91 commission says , 200 @entity29 leaders in @entity2 have been killed , more than 10,000 have been dismissed from government and university jobs , and followers are forbidden to " establish places of worship , schools , or any independent religious associations in @entity2			1
" they are " denied government jobs and pensions as well as the right to inherit property			2
their marriages and divorces also are not recognized , and they have difficulty obtaining death certificates			0
@entity29 cemeteries , holy places , and community properties are often seized or desecrated , " the commission says			1
@entity29 spokesman @entity141 , who teaches economics at @entity143 , @entity143 , said that while @entity29 are not allowed to serve as military officers , they were recruited to serve as low - level privates in the @entity146			1
and since 2005 , around 400 @entity29 have been jailed arbitrarily , the @entity91 commission said , including seven of the community leaders seized three years ago			1
" it reminds one of what @entity150 wanted to do prior to the extermination , " @entity141 said			0
that is a reference to the persecution and genocide of @entity157 under @entity150 's @entity159 regime in @entity160 in the 20th century			2
as @entity29 were systemically banned from higher education , they developed the underground - style institute			1
@entity141 said that the thinking had been , " why ca n't we just start something ourselves ? " at first the classes were correspondence courses			0
others were held in private homes , where dental students stood over kitchen sinks in denture - making lessons			0
" it became a grass - roots homegrown development			0
" no one bothered the students and teachers at first as the group amassed volunteers , equipment and willing students			0
its faculty comprised volunteer professionals who once taught in @entity2 but lost their jobs after the revolution because they are @entity29			1
but about 10 years later , the crackdowns started			0
the power plays made no sense to @entity29 and seemed like oppression for oppression 's sake			1
@entity141 said one teacher told him that security officers " destroyed everything " in a raid and did n't even have the good sense to confiscate the material for their own use			0
with the help of funding from foreign @entity29 organizations , the system grew and is now a virtual online college			1
the effort is a serious initiative to help @entity2 @entity29 gain the right qualifications for trades and professions and the bachelor 's degrees issued by the school have been accepted by some @entity217 colleges , the @entity29 say on their website			1
the @entity29 educational network offers over 20 associate , undergraduate and graduate degrees in a range of subjects from literature and law to math and pharmacy , the website says			1
@entity141 said he does n't know what compelled the authorities to carry out the latest raids , but at least one of the people has been charged with acts against the security of the regime			0
" it 's not clear to us how the study of physics , chemistry and science endanger the @entity2 government , " @entity141 said			1
the professor seized in the sunday , may 22 raid typified the faculty , according to his wife and daughter in @entity2			2
they did not want to be named for security reasons			0
his relatives said he was unpaid for his labors teaching math and economics to fellow @entity29			2
the security officers told the teacher and his wife he would be held in @entity10 's @entity259			0
that 's a section of the penitentiary said to be for political prisoners and run by intelligence officers			0
" he was not paid or reimbursed for this work , " his daughter told @entity0			0
" he did it out of love , love for teaching and love for his students			0
he wanted to give young people an education so they can have a good life and make something of themselves			0
it was his passion in life to educate others			0
" after the three security officers , armed with a warrant , walked in the @entity29 man 's house , the man quickly told his wife that the police had arrived			2
" please put your veil on , your brothers have come , " a phrase meant to show respect to the police of the @entity43 regime , which expect women cover their heads			2
the officers explained that they would be looking through the family 's personal belongings			0
while the wife accepted that , she insisted that she accompany them ; the officials let her			0
" i could n't just sit down and let men sort through my home			0
i told them , ' this is my house			0
' i could n't just stand to the side , " she told @entity0			0
the men were respectful , she said			0
they did n't destroy material or ransack the house			0
but they seized memory cards from cameras , mobile phones , computer hard drives and books on the faith and university			2
before the father was taken away , he told his wife not to worry , saying the authorities will realize he did n't do anything wrong			0
but his relatives and the @entity29 community are worried that interrogators attempting wider clampdowns will try to pry names of other teachers and students out of the arrested teachers			1
before one unsuccessful effort to visit him at the prison last week , his wife said , " @entity55 willing , i will be able to see him tomorrow and he will be released			0
i am positive about this because he did not do anything wrong and he is a good person			0

the @entity29 faith , founded in @entity2 , is considered blasphemous there
now , 16 @entity29 professors have been arrested for helping followers get advanced degrees
a government newspaper calls it " a cover for the propagation of the @entity29 faith "
a @entity91 agency says @entity2 " will stop at nothing in its shameless persecution of the @entity29 "
