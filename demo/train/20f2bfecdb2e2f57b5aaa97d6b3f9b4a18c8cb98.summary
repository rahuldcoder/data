-- @entity1 was dying for a cup of coffee when she recently ran into a @entity5 convenience store			0
to her pleasant surprise , the coffee was free -- as long as she would commit to drinking it in either a red @entity10 cup or a blue @entity12 cup			1
" which are you going to choose , @entity16 ? " her son asked			0
a gun - owning , big - government - hating @entity21 , @entity1 's every instinct told her to buy a @entity10 cup			1
but @entity1 , 56 , and her daughter have asthma -- a pre-existing condition -- and with @entity12 as president they 'll be guaranteed the ability to buy insurance			1
@entity1 stood in the @entity5 and stared at the red and blue cups , stymied by the choice they represented			1
@entity5 tries to predict presidential election winner a concrete issue perhaps no other election has posed such a difficult personal decision for some conservatives : how do you vote if you 're ideologically conservative , but you 're benefiting , or stand to benefit , from the @entity40 , often referred to as " @entity40 " ? " in 2008 , health care was a very conceptual , a very theoretical issue , " said @entity41 , a professor of political science and communication at the @entity44			1
" this year it 's very concrete and real			1
" some @entity21 told @entity0 they would never vote @entity48 , even though they might benefit from @entity40 , while others said they will switch their vote because of health issues			1
" the real question is : could defections in this group make a difference in states where the race is close , such as @entity58 , @entity59 or @entity60 ? " @entity41 said			0
" i think in those states it 's so tight they could make a difference			1
" several groups of people would fare very differently under @entity10 's health care plan than they do under @entity40 , such as those with preexisting conditions , which can range from anything from back pain to cancer			1
between 20 % and 50 % of all @entity72 have a preexisting condition , according to the @entity74			0
@entity40 tells insurance companies they ca n't say no to people with preexisting conditions , or charge them more because of their health issues			1
according to his website , @entity10 's health plan calls for " preventing discrimination " against people with preexisting conditions as long as they 've maintained continuous insurance coverage in the past , but does not define what " continuous coverage " means			1
@entity86 could also fare differently under @entity10 's plan			1
according to the @entity74 , some 3.1 million young adults now have health insurance because of @entity40 , which requires insurance companies to allow young adults to stay on their parents ' policies up until the age of 26			1
before @entity40 , insurance companies in many states took young people off their parents ' policies at age 18 or 19			1
@entity10 has vowed to repeal @entity40			1
in the presidential debate , the former @entity101 governor said the " private marketplace " is already taking care of young adults who want to stay on their parents ' plans so the @entity72 does n't need a government mandate			0
however , it 's not clear that insurance companies will allow young adults to stay on their parents ' insurance up until age 26 without a mandate			1
if @entity40 is reversed , insurance companies " will make their own decisions about the coverage options they provide , " according to a statement from @entity118			1
the undecided : what will sway them ? ' i feel torn ' @entity122 may become one of the @entity21 " defectors " @entity41 says could make a difference in battleground states			0
@entity122 , 49 , has voted @entity21 in nearly every presidential election since he cast his vote for @entity129 in 1980 , but this year might be different			1
for two years his 22 - year - old stepdaughter , a self - employed dog trainer , did n't have health insurance			0
then @entity40 kicked in and she was allowed onto her father 's insurance			1
" if something had happened to her during those two years it would have been a disaster , " @entity122 says			0
the @entity136 , @entity137 , resident is leaning toward @entity12 , but not just because of his stepdaughter			0
@entity122 's wife , @entity140 , has diabetes and is in the final stages of breast cancer treatment			1
she 's now on his insurance , but if he ever lost his job , his wife would be faced with trying to buy insurance on her own and would surely be rejected			1
" i 'm really torn , " he said			0
" because of @entity12 , i now have a wife who can get covered			0
but really , at heart , i 'm a limited - government kind of guy			0
" @entity122 said if the election were held today , he 'd vote for @entity12 , but not without a lot of reservations			1
" it 's really an intriguing conundrum , " he said			2
photos : from the campaign trail ' i 'm born to be a @entity21 ' like @entity122 , @entity160 feels conflicted about her vote			2
a popular diabetes blogger , @entity160 , 31 , knew a woman who stopped taking her insulin regularly when she lost her insurance , and @entity160 thinks it might have contributed to her death			0
@entity160 said she herself would be " in a pickle " if she were ever laid off because insurance companies do n't want to offer policies to diabetics			0
still , @entity160 , a lifelong @entity21 who lives in south @entity173 , will vote for @entity10 in november			1
she cares about other issues besides health -- most notably the economy -- and she 's voted @entity21 in every election			2
she even remembers the excitement she felt when she shook @entity180 's hand at a rally at her high school 16 years ago			2
" the @entity21 most closely matches the things i value and the beliefs i have , " she said			0
" i 'm pretty passionate about it			0
" @entity186 , who also has diabetes , has n't considered voting for @entity12 for even a minute			2
" i 'm born to be a @entity21 , " she said			0
@entity186 , 52 , knows it would be difficult if not impossible to buy insurance on her own because of her disease , but she said she 's not worried because she has good insurance through her job as a public school teacher in @entity195 , where she 's worked for 20 years			2
" it 's very hard to get rid of teachers , " she said			2
" i 'm very protective of my job			0
i document everything i do			0
" voter issues a choice to make @entity1 felt " weird " as she stood there in the 7 - 11 in @entity203 , @entity173 , thinking about which cup to take			2
she thought about her insurance , which covers her only if " i get hit by a bus			0
" it 's the only insurance she can afford given her preexisting condition			2
she thought about how she 's still paying off a $ 22,000 emergency room bill from last year			2
she thought about her 25 - year - old daughter , who 's on her father 's insurance only because of @entity40			1
but she also thought about how , in many fundamental ways , she just does n't like @entity12			0
then she reached for the blue cup with @entity12 's name on it			2
" i really do feel conflicted , " she said			0
" but for me , it 's all about health care			2
it 's my number one thing			0
" did debate make undecided voters more decided ? @entity0 's @entity222 contributed to this story .			0
