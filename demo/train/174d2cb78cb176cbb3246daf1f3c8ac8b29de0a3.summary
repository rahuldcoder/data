@entity1 sen. @entity0 declared the war against @entity4 " illegal " in a new opinion piece monday , urging conservatives to speak out against president @entity8 's decision not to seek congressional authorization for military action against the terrorist group			1
" this war is now illegal			0
it must be declared and made valid , or it must be ended , " the @entity14 @entity13 wrote in an op - ed published monday by @entity16			1
the @entity18 began airstrikes in @entity20 in august and in @entity21 in september , citing a 2001 measure known as the authorization for the @entity24 as the president 's legal basis for going after terrorist threats			2
@entity0 cites the @entity28 of 1973 in stressing his long - held position that all military action must be approved by @entity31			1
the exception is when a situation is considered urgent			0
in that case , a president has 60 days to get authorization after military action			1
if there 's no approval from @entity31 , the president has 30 days to end the mission			0
@entity0 plants feet between both sides of foreign policy debate while @entity0 said he does n't think the @entity28 specifically applies to the @entity4 situation -- because the @entity18 had not been attacked -- he notes that even if it did , the president 's time would be up			1
" taking military action against @entity4 is justified			2
the president acting without @entity31 is not , " he wrote , reiterating a stance he 's held since september			0
this fall @entity0 has described the airstrikes against @entity21 as appropriate action but said @entity8 's method for doing so was " unconstitutional			2
" the op - ed comes as @entity0 , who 's seen as a likely presidential candidate in 2016 , has been trying to shed his isolationist image yet maintain his libertarian - leaning roots			0
in the new op - ed , he specifically reached out to conservatives , saying they " they should end their conspicuous silence about the president 's usurpation of @entity31 ' sole authority to declare war			1
" @entity0 blasts @entity8 as arrogant ' autocrat ' he suggested conservatives are being hypocritical in their criticism of @entity8 by lambasting him for acting alone through executive actions but staying quiet when he authorizes military action without approval			1
" conservatives who blast the president for ignoring the separation of powers on immigration display a fatal inconsistency by embracing unlimited war - making powers , " he wrote			0
@entity0 : @entity1 's ' barnacled enablers ' push for constant war his piece comes as a report from @entity85 lists new details about his all - but - certain presidential campaign			2
the report says he would likely headquarter his campaign in @entity89 , @entity14 , and would move forward with a 2016 re-election bid for the @entity91 on top of a presidential run			0
@entity0 , who 's attempting to sharpen his foreign policy brand , also raises questions about @entity97 's physical stamina as well as her record as secretary of state and her involvement in @entity101 .			0
