@entity0 -- what do you do for an encore after a landslide re-election victory ? how about taking your show on the road			0
and that 's just what @entity10 gov. @entity9 will do later this month , as he takes over as chairman of the @entity13 , giving an already very visible governor with national aspirations even more visibility			1
while the high - profile position should enhance @entity9 's status as a leader of the @entity20 , he 's already coming under attack from some potential 2016 rivals			1
@entity9 wins big with three - dozen states electing governors in 2014 , @entity9 will be crisscrossing the country , supporting some of the party 's brightest stars			1
but he 'll also be introducing himself to those who know only the larger - than - life figure on tv			0
" i 'm going to be traveling all over the country trying to elect @entity13 governors and that 's a pretty good thing to do for the @entity20 , " @entity9 said tuesday in an interview with @entity1 anchor and chief @entity0 correspondent @entity35			1
the states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar -- @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 -- are among those holding elections next year			2
that itinerary works out well for someone who 's got an eye on the @entity52			0
" the chairmanship of the @entity13 allows a governor to run for president before he actually runs for president , building relationships with organizers in key states and expanding his network of national contributors , " said @entity53 , a @entity13 strategist and veteran of numerous @entity20 campaigns			1
" it can also warehouse staff that can later move over to a presidential campaign			0
he can also use the @entity13 to collect chits by helping fellow @entity20 governors whom he hopes will eventually help him			1
it is a great platform for a @entity13 governor who is being urged to consider a presidential bid			0
" but @entity9 could face intraparty sniping that he 's using the position to further his chances of winning the party 's presidential nomination			1
then - @entity81 gov. @entity80 , who chaired the committee in 2006 , ahead of his first run for the @entity52 in 2008 , and @entity85 gov. @entity84 , who chaired the @entity13 ahead of his 2012 bid for president , also got such quiet criticism			0
already under attack @entity9 is touting his conservative credentials			1
" i 'm a conservative , " he said in his interview with @entity35 , anchor of @entity1 's " the lead with @entity35 , " adding " i 've governed as a conservative in this state			2
" but a couple of high - profile @entity20 are already trying to define @entity9 as not being conservative enough			1
sen. @entity97 of @entity98 , a favorite of tea party activists and a likely rival in 2016 should @entity9 decide to run , seemed to be trying to tag @entity9 with the m - word			1
" i think the @entity20 is a big party , and we need moderates like @entity9 who can win in @entity10 , " @entity97 told @entity103 on tuesday on " @entity104			1
" " what that means about the national party , i 'm not sure there 's an answer			0
but we do need moderates like @entity9 in the party			2
" @entity97 also took a not - so - subtle jab wednesday at @entity9 for starring in ads aimed at promoting tourism in @entity10 in the aftermath of @entity116			2
in a @entity119 @entity118 hearing to review the federal response to last year 's deadly storm , @entity97 questioned housing and urban development secretary @entity122 about whether @entity116 relief funds should be spent on television ads. @entity97 said that " people running for office put their mug all over these ads while they are in the middle of a campaign			2
in @entity10 , $ 25 million was spent on ads that included somebody running for political office			0
" " you think there might be a conflict of interest there ? you know that 's a real problem			0
that 's why when people who are trying to do good and trying to use taxpayer dollars wisely they are offended to see our money spent on political ads. you know that 's just offensive			0
" and sen. @entity148 of @entity46 , another possible @entity20 candidate , seemed to suggest that the impact of @entity9 's landslide victory may be contained within the @entity10 's borders			1
" governor @entity9 has certainly shown he has a way of winning in @entity10 , in states like @entity10 ... so i congratulate him on that , " @entity148 said in an interview with @entity1 chief congressional correspondent @entity153			1
@entity148 : do n't jump to conclusions about @entity9 's win @entity160 , a @entity13 analyst and @entity1 contributor , said he does n't buy in to the idea that @entity9 is a moderate			1
" look , everyone is invested in defining @entity9 as a moderate			2
liberals want to ascribe his victory to a repudiation of conservatism			0
and his political rivals want to beat him in a primary			0
but i do n't know that i can accept the premise , " @entity160 said			0
" his greatest conservative sin is participating in @entity175 's @entity174 expansion			2
on everything else -- guns , immigration -- he 's given lip service to moderation , not governed that way			0
an establishment @entity13 strategist said that infighting and sniping wo n't help the party with those it 's trying to appeal to			0
" the best thing that anyone who has their eye on 2016 can do for themselves and the party right now is to work together , show the @entity197 people that @entity20 can govern responsibly and work to make inroads with sections of the electorate that did n't support @entity20 in the last two presidential elections , " @entity189 , former @entity190 communications director , told @entity1			1
ready to run ? @entity9 's everywhere in the wake of his landslide re-election			1
the longtime @entity206 fan 's on the cover of @entity208 , with the headline " @entity211 " on the story , and he 's scheduled to do four of the five sunday talk shows this weekend			0
asked wednesday by @entity1 's @entity213 if all the talk about his potential bid for the @entity52 is becoming a distraction , @entity9 pushed back , saying , " i do n't get distracted very easily			2
it takes a lot to distract me , and i think the way it wo n't be a distraction is i simply wo n't let it			0
" @entity9 's re-election speech tuesday night sounded like something more -- the governor touted his bipartisan successes to an audience far beyond the @entity229 ballroom and the borders of the @entity10			1
" i know tonight a dispirited @entity197 , angry with their dysfunctional government in @entity0 , looks to @entity10 to say , ' is what i think happening really happening ? are people really coming together ? are we really working , african - americans and @entity237 , suburbanites and city dwellers , farmers and teachers ? are we really all working together ? ' let me give the answer to everyone who is watching tonight : under this government our first job is to get the job done , and as long as i 'm governor that job will always , always be finished , " said @entity9 , to loud applause			0
what @entity9 's win says about 2016 @entity250 , the former @entity52 speaker and current co-host of @entity1 's " crossfire , " knows some things about running for the @entity52			1
" i think it was an introductory speech , " the one - time 2012 @entity20 frontrunner said			0
@entity53 added , it was n't an acceptance speech , that was an announcement speech			0
" numbers to brag about @entity9 's victory was never in doubt			2
and as the polls in the @entity10 closed tuesday night , @entity1 and the other news networks rushed to project that the high - profile governor would win a second term in @entity265			0
but the big questions heading into @entity267 2013 were how large a victory @entity9 would capture over @entity269 , his little - known @entity270 challenger , and how @entity9 would perform with voters who tend to cast ballots for @entity270			2
with just about all the ballots counted , @entity9 won 60 % of the vote , the most by a @entity13 statewide in more than a quarter - century and according to @entity1 exit polls , @entity9 performed well with groups that the @entity20 needs to win if it wants to win national elections			1
@entity9 carried nearly six in 10 women and won all age groups other than those 18 - 29 , which he just missed winning			0
@entity9 also won the @entity237 vote and took just more than a fifth of the @entity286 - @entity197 vote , a much better performance than most @entity20 in recent elections			1
@entity9 also grabbed two - thirds of independents and a third of @entity270 in a state where @entity270 and independents made up nearly three - quarters of tuesday 's electorate			2
@entity9 , @entity295 took different paths to victory the exit polls appear to bolster @entity9 's case that he 's among the most electable of the potential @entity20 @entity52 hopefuls heading into 2016			1
but if he runs for president , @entity9 will have to get through a battleground of conservative voters in the @entity13 primaries and caucuses similar to those he faced in blue - state @entity10 this year			1
@entity1 's @entity309 and @entity310 contributed to this report			0

@entity9 follows big re-election win with *yearlong* stint as head of @entity20 governors
the position offers @entity9 networking opportunities but also makes him target
**republicans** next year elect governors in key states that are also key states in 2016 primaries
a big challenge for @entity9 is *convincing* conservative **republicans** he 's one of them
