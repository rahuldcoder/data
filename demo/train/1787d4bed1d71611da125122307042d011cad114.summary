@entity0 , @entity1 -- five @entity5 service members were killed thursday after an improvised explosive device detonated in southern @entity1 , officials said			1
the attack occurred several days after 30 @entity5 died in a helicopter crash in central - eastern @entity1			1
that was @entity5 's worst single - incident loss of life since the war began			2
no other details were provided regarding thursday 's incident			0
on wednesday , @entity16 spokesman gen. @entity15 told reporters that coalition forces had killed 189 militants in joint operations against @entity22 insurgents across the country in the past three weeks			1
@entity15 announced that 362 insurgents had been detained since july 23 , as @entity26 and @entity1 forces stepped up raids against @entity22 strongholds			1
" we 've increased our efforts over the last several months , " said @entity29			0
@entity32 , a spokesman for @entity26 's @entity33 in @entity1			0
" the focus is to allow them to have less and less ( in terms of ) safe havens			0
" but a @entity22 spokesman rejected the insurgent casualty figure cited by the @entity40 in what appears to be the latest example of coalition forces vying with insurgents in attempting to control information from the battlefield			1
@entity22 spokesman @entity47 said fewer than 30 militants had been killed during that time , adding that the insurgency had stepped up its guerrilla tactics and mine attacks			1
@entity47 also rejected an earlier @entity26 statement that said coalition forces had killed insurgents responsible for the downing in eastern @entity1 of a @entity56 helicopter that left 38 @entity5 and @entity1 personnel dead			1
he said a @entity26 airstrike killed a separate group of insurgents , while those responsible for saturday 's strike slipped into a separate @entity1 province			0
he did not elaborate , and @entity2 could not independently confirm the claims			0
@entity64 aired thursday video of what it said was wreckage of the helicopter			1
the video shows unspent shells ; papers in @entity72 and rubble			0
" these are the only pictures of the helicopter remains that @entity26 forces were not able to hide , " the narrator says			2
" it 's apparent that the helicopter did not only fall , but it exploded and scattered			0
" saturday 's attack on the helicopter represented a major blow to @entity5 's most elite fighting unit : 17 @entity81 were killed along with other special operations forces , @entity1 commandos and a civilian translator			1
@entity85 have conducted at least 2,500 raids by helicopter in the last year and saturday 's strike was the first during that time in which an aircraft supporting operations was lost , @entity33 said			0
meanwhile , the country faces looming questions over its long - term stability and the prospect of a resurgence by the @entity22 as a security handover and @entity26 drawdown take place			2
but it remains unclear whether recent attacks by @entity22 fighters represent newfound insurgent strength			2
in may , the @entity22 launched what they called a @entity106 against @entity1 and @entity26 forces , in a wave of attacks that has continued into late summer			2
but @entity26 forces , bolstered by last year 's " surge " of 33,000 additional @entity5 troops , say they have increased operations against @entity22 safe havens , pushing insurgents from strongholds in the south and east			1
meanwhile , 10,000 @entity5 soldiers are scheduled to depart @entity1 by year 's end , with the full drawdown set for the end of 2014			2
@entity123 diplomats , however , predict a @entity26 military presence will extend beyond the drawdown date			0
@entity2 's @entity126 and @entity127 contributed to this report .			0
