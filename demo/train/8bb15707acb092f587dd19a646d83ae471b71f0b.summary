-- @entity1 means " star " in @entity3 , one of the languages spoken in @entity6			0
so when @entity7 gave her lifestyle store that name , she decided to add a sparkle to her business			1
" my brand is @entity12 revamped , " she says			1
" @entity12 getting a modern twist and just bringing the @entity14 and @entity12 together and marrying them into something beautiful			1
" @entity7 grew up in @entity6 , as the name of her store suggests , but her business is in the thumping heart of @entity21 's biggest city , @entity22			1
funky fabrics shoppers who visit her store find jewelry , sandals and vibrantly - colored outfits on the shelves			2
some of @entity7 's garments even use indigenous @entity21 fabrics like the @entity33 and @entity34			1
" i make dresses , i cater mostly for women , " @entity7 explains , " and i do jewelry and also sandals , which have all got an influence of @entity12 fabrics			1
" whilst taking a tour of the store , @entity7 points out one her favorite dresses , " i love it because it defies what @entity21 think of the @entity46 , which is funky , it 's stylish , and it can be worn anywhere			1
" with such a variety of designs , fabrics and patterns on display it 's clear that @entity7 's work is her passion			1
" sometimes i see a fabric and it just speaks to me , " she says			0
" so i take that and start thinking of what i can do to bring out its beauty			2
" career change as a child , @entity7 dreamed of working in the design industry , but she ended up studying marketing in @entity66			1
she soon realized she was n't cut out for the advertising world and moved to @entity68 to study interior design			0
" the school that i was going to also had fashion design			0
i ended up wanting to find ways of promoting fashion designers and so i put on a show for them , " she explains			2
" when i came back to @entity21 , i worked with the @entity76 ... and my job was to find underground fashion talent and put them on the stage			1
that 's how i ended up making my own dresses ... and the people that would come to the show loved my clothes			2
" that background is reflected in her store , where she promotes other entrepreneurs alongside her own creations			0
" i choose to include other designers because there is n't particularly a space where designers can showcase their work , " @entity7 says			1
" it 's expensive to open your own store			0
so this was something that gave me that chance to promote other designers plus sell my own things , " she adds			0
like @entity7 , many women in @entity12 are capitalizing on their entrepreneurial skills			1
in fact , the continent leads the world in the number of women starting businesses , with almost equal levels of male and female entrepreneurs			2
overall , @entity12 has a higher proportion of female entrepreneurs compared to other regions , with @entity117 and @entity118 ( both 40.7 % ) topping the charts			1
the stats reveal that countries like the @entity122 ( 10.4 % ) , the @entity123 ( 5.5 % ) , and @entity124 ( 3.1 % ) have a less equal business landscape			0
overcoming obstacles over its six year lifespan , @entity127 has established a reputation and a steady stream of clients			0
but it was n't always so easy for @entity7			1
" i had to find a place that was close to my customers , so i shopped around for different places where i could share with somebody who had an existing space and they were not using it			2
i had to do a lot of convincing when i finally got the space that i am in now , " she remembers			0
but getting a physical presence was n't the only obstacle @entity7 had to overcome			2
she says that creating advertising and getting people to know that her shop was there took time			0
" it 's lucky that i am right by the road , so that way when people pass by i put mannequins outside with my dresses			0
" while she has faced difficulties , @entity7 has no regrets ; " i totally love what i do , " she says			2
" from a kid , i 've always known i was going to work in the industry ; in design industry somehow			0
i am so fortunate that i am actually doing what i love to do			0
