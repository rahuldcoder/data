-- presidents , prime ministers and assorted rulers , consider that you have been warned : a massive protest can start at any time , seemingly over any issue , and can grow to a size and intensity no one expected			1
your country 's image , your own prestige , could risk unraveling as you face the wrath of the people			1
the newest iconic images from @entity15 and from @entity16 -- two countries that have promoted themselves as models to emulate -- include shocking scenes of police brutality , of government clampdown against peaceful protesters			1
we have entered a new age of protests			1
while politics remain intensely local , individuals are more interconnected			2
in @entity15 , a small protest over plans to destroy one of @entity33 's last remaining parks exploded in size and intensity after a harsh police crackdown shocked the nation			1
the sight of police spraying giant clouds of tear gas and beating peaceful protesters touched a nerve , inflaming simmering concerns about an increasingly authoritarian regime			2
in a matter of days , waves of demonstrations , the biggest in decades , spread across the country			2
prime minister @entity49 , who has not lacked for self - confidence over his 10 years in power , came under sharp criticism over his response to the protests			1
has he grown arrogant with power ? having led his party to consecutive victories at the polls , sucking the air out of the powerful military , and overseeing @entity15 's rise to new heights of prosperity and international assertiveness , all of a sudden he looked less awe - inspiring			1
@entity49 may have faced down world leaders , but when he faced his own people he tarnished his image			1
he is now accused by many at home and abroad of lacking in democratic instincts			2
the country has new national icons			0
the newest is the " @entity74 , " a protester who steadfastly held his ground amid the chaos , standing for hours gazing at a picture of @entity79			0
there 's the " woman in red , " a modernly dressed woman -- symbolizing the secular , world of personal freedom many of the demonstrators seek to defend			1
a similar image emerged from @entity16			1
a young woman who appears utterly harmless was sprayed in the face by a policeman dressed in full riot gear			0
just like @entity15 , no one could have predicted the turn of events in @entity16			1
a country that has symbolized @entity97 's dramatic rise from poverty , where left - leaning governments have combined social programs and market - friendly policies , nearly eradicating extreme poverty , suddenly erupted in a wave of popular fury			1
the government of president @entity106 faced the largest protests in 20 years			1
and it all started over an increase in bus fares			1
the protests over bus fares touched on worries about a slowdown in the economy , about persistent inequality , corruption and costly projects in preparation for hosting the upcoming @entity120 and @entity121			2
@entity106 , a former revolutionary herself , has been taking a much more conciliatory approach than the pugnacious @entity49			0
on wednesday , government officials in @entity124 and @entity125 announced that they would revoke the hike in bus fares in their cities			0
in this era of connectivity , a small complaint can explode			1
politicians may outmaneuver rival parties during election campaigns			0
they can claim a majority at the polls -- as @entity49 does n't tire of remarking he has -- and they can ply their trade on the global stage			2
but they now have to deal with their citizens ' demands in a much more public way			0
popular claims have new strength in our age of social media			0
it 's impossible to predict which issue will find flammable material hiding in shared resentments and ignite raging fires of discontent			1
the water cannons and the tear gas may disperse the first wave of protesters , but a click of a smartphone can produce a photo or video that instantly catches people 's attention , potentially attracting even larger protests			1
the crowd may grow if its concerns are ignored , especially if police repression is violent			0
one of the challenges for democratic governments is to balance what may be legitimate requirements of public order with a reasonable hearing for reasonable demands			2
that is the response that separates the tyrants from the democrats			0
public space occupations and demonstrations have occurred in nations without democracy			0
we saw how regimes responded to protests in places like @entity187 and @entity188			2
we have seen crackdowns in @entity190 last year and in @entity191 after the 2009 elections			0
these new protests start over smaller issues -- not over tyranny or basic democratic rights			1
local issues have a new power to surge with little warning , electrifying the crowds , jolting people out of complacency			1
governments can be caught by surprise by what seem like trivial matters -- a small rise in bus fare or saving trees in a park			1
it was n't very long ago when every meeting of the powerful nations , of the @entity214 and the @entity215 , brought out angry anti-globalization crowds			0
now , the concerns are more immediate , more personal			0
when president @entity219 arrived in @entity220 on monday for the meeting of the @entity223 nations , there were more police officers than protesters			0
the nature of protest has changed			2
governments may have the power to spy on citizens , to read their e-mails and listen to their conversations			2
but they have largely lost their ability to control the information that is out there			0
governments have lost the power to change the subject , to divert attention , to blame a multinational institution or another country for the woes at home			2
stories now refuse to die			0
protesters , if angered by the government 's response , are more likely to persevere			0
heads of government can not control their public image the way they once could			0
new technology may make it easier for governments to learn what the people are thinking , but it makes it harder for them to shape what the people believe			1
it 's a new age			0
they should consider themselves warned			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity264 .			0

@entity266 : a massive protest can start any time -- just look at @entity15 and @entity16
@entity270 : in this era of connectivity , a little complaint can ignite raging fire of discontent
she says these recent protests started over smaller issues , not over tyranny
@entity270 : technology has made it harder for governments to shape what people believe in
