following @entity3 's revolution , oil production has been restored and the country has slipped from the front pages			1
once more , @entity3 has become @entity6 rather than southern @entity7 , and news dispatches surface only when @entity11 government 's worst fears appear close to being realized			1
as most @entity3 admit that after four - plus decades of @entity13 , it will take time to build a mature democracy			1
yet @entity3 remain hopeful that progress is being made			1
for travelers , this means a renewed opportunity to explore one of @entity6 's most interesting states			2
it 's vast and empty at 679,362 square miles , @entity3 is second in size only to neighboring @entity24 among @entity6 countries			1
it 's two and a half times bigger than @entity27 , almost 85 times the size of @entity29 and 90 % desert			1
@entity3 's population is small , just more than 6 million , more than 80 % inhabiting the coastal region			1
more than half of that is concentrated in the just three cities -- @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			2
for first - time visitors , an itinerary based on @entity36 and @entity37 , with day excursions from each city and a connecting domestic flight , makes most sense			0
@entity45 ( +44 020 978 0508 ; www.simoontravel.com ) or @entity46 ( www.temehu.com ) are two tour agencies worth knowing			0
road travel is exciting but hazardous by car , the 600 - mile journey along the coast between @entity36 and @entity3 's second city , @entity37 , takes around 12 hours			1
heading south from @entity36 to the ancient @entity53 trading town of @entity54 is an eight or nine hour slog , while the @entity56 in the southern desert region of @entity58 lie some 13 hours from @entity36			1
as well as recalcitrant camels , encroaching dunes , sand storms and wildly unpredictable driving conditions and drivers , the insecurity of postrevolutionary @entity3 demands travelers ' full attention before any overland journey			1
the revolution saw the collapse of many commercial bus services , though these were off - limits to foreigners anyway			0
car rental companies such as @entity75 ( www.sixt.com ) and @entity76 ( www.hertz.co.uk ) are building a @entity3 presence , though locations are limited and unless you 're used to what might be called " ebullient " traffic , you may want to take a back seat			1
stifling @entity13 - era group travel restrictions no longer exist , but for tourists with limited time , complicated land explorations are best made through tour operators utilizing their vehicles and drivers			0
there 's no drinking ( except there is ) the " @entity97 " of @entity13 's 1969 coup d'etat banned alcohol , and there 's no chance of change			1
despite public conservatism , however , @entity3 close to a suitable land border are no strangers to losing themselves in a foreign bar , and regular cross-border traffic means lots of illicit alcohol enters the country from @entity106 and @entity107			1
it 's an open secret that cars of young men parked in out - of - the - way places are often de facto drinking dens			2
as well as smuggled booze , a drink known as bokha , distilled from dates , figs or grapes , is widely consumed			1
unfortunately , some misguided producers add methanol to increase potency			0
in march 2013 , a batch of bad bokha claimed 52 lives in @entity36 -- one reason to stay on the straight and narrow and stick to sweet tea and strong coffee			2
the @entity129 do n't work plastic cards can not be relied upon , either to pay bills or get money from atms or banks			0
functioning atms can be counted on one hand , and credit card payments for goods and services are almost unknown outside @entity36			0
as a result it 's not uncommon to see large , tightly bound bricks of dinars exchanged as a matter of course			2
those accustomed to cashless card - driven lifestyles may feel uncomfortable when carrying large quantities of banknotes			0
despite recent high - profile outrages perpetrated by militias , religious ideologues or both , crimes against individuals such as muggings and thefts are rare			0
and in commerce , @entity3 are straightforward and honest to a fault			1
gas is cheaper than water filling the tank of an average car costs around six dinars ( $ 4.76 ) , while a liter bottle of water from a cafe costs one dinar ( $ 0.80 )			1
@entity3 oil production has returned to prerevolution levels of 1.6 million barrels a day			1
the country 's known reserves are the largest in @entity6 and fourth - largest in the world -- sufficient for 85 years at the present output			2
it 's a constant refrain among the postrevolutionary populace , however , that " @entity3 is a rich country but the people are poor			1
" walking around the neglected , crumbling streets of @entity37 , a city that has seen little investment since @entity178 , one can only wonder where the oil revenues were spent			2
economic prospects for @entity3 may about to improve			1
the @entity182 estimates 16 % to 18 % growth in gdp for 2013 , the @entity181 suggests nearer 20 %			2
it 's not all sand @entity187 ( @entity188 ) is an achievable day - trip from @entity37 , a good reminder that @entity3 is n't all desert			1
quite literally , the trip provides a breath of fresh air			0
relatively high rainfall means these uplands live up to their name -- fields yield healthy cereal crops and orchards produce succulent fruit , while @entity3 's luckiest sheep graze rolling green hillside pastures			1
@entity205 colonial farmhouses , under new management , are still visible , as are abandoned railway stations ( trains have long since ceased operations )			0
@entity209 has replaced @entity13 as a symbol before the revolution , @entity13 portrait was everywhere in @entity3			1
without turning your head , it was easy to reach double figures when counting reproductions of his all - seeing image			0
now they 're gone , often replaced by images of an elderly man in white robes -- @entity209			0
who is he ? beginning in 1912 and lasting for almost 20 years , @entity205 imperial designs on @entity3 were resisted by a determined local insurgency led by @entity209			1
his bands of fighters utilized guerrilla tactics and superior knowledge of the terrain to ambush @entity205 columns			0
opposition was quelled only when a 73 - year - old @entity209 was captured and executed by @entity205 armed forces in 1931			0
despite attempting to co-opt @entity209 's legacy as a nationalist hero , @entity13 ultimately felt threatened by the sheikh and had his body removed from its tomb in the center of @entity37 to an out - of - the - way rural town about 37 miles away			2
@entity13 was right to be worried			0
@entity209 remained an inspiration to modern revolutionaries , and in 2011 , his battle cry of " we will win or we will die " was heard once more			0
it 's filled with @entity249 heritage eighty miles east of @entity36 , @entity250 was the hometown of roman emperor @entity251			2
even those prone to chronic attacks of temple fatigue ca n't fail to be wowed by the grandeur of its ruins			2
the site is vast and well - preserved , though to date only one third has been excavated			0
the almost complete amphitheater and circus outside the main city are made all the more intriguing by virtue of their relative neglect			0
some 40 miles east of @entity36 , @entity267 's remains have been restored			0
while only a quarter of the site has been excavated , mosaics thus far uncovered rival those found in @entity273			0
and 120 miles east of @entity37 , the ruins of @entity275 reflect enduring @entity277 influences of language and architecture ; the city 's @entity280 is larger than the @entity282 in @entity283			1
anywhere else , all three sites would be honeypot tourist destinations , but these days it 's possible you 'll have them to yourself			0
@entity250 and @entity267 are easy day trips from @entity36 ; @entity275 is reached from @entity37 and with an early start can also be visited in a day			0
because of poor security , travel eastward to @entity293 is n't recommended			0
though it 's easy to visit sites independently , a knowledgeable guide can bring the ruins to life			2
@entity46 ( www.temehu.com ) can organize excursions in advance			0
" @entity6 -- the @entity302 " ( www.bradtguides.com ) has a useful section on @entity3 .			2

@entity3 is two and a half times bigger than @entity27 and 90 % desert
alcohol is banned , but there 's smuggled booze and bokha , distilled from dates , figs
gasoline is cheaper than water in this oil rich but extremely *dry* @entity316 nation
ancient ruins from the @entity277 and @entity321 eras are *spectacular*
