@entity0 -- @entity3 @entity2 on thursday blocked a @entity5 measure championed by president @entity6 to end tax breaks for the major oil companies			1
the procedural vote of 51 - 47 , which failed to reach the needed threshold of 60 in favor , killed the measure , which was given little chance of eventually winning approval in the @entity2 - controlled @entity15			1
four @entity5 opposed the bill while one @entity2 supported it			1
@entity6 and @entity5 had pushed it in an attempt to gain political advantage as rising gas prices continue to hurt and anger @entity22 voters in an election year			1
in remarks shortly before the @entity3 voted , @entity6 said the nation will be watching to see where @entity27 stands on the issue			1
" with record profits and rising production , i 'm not worried about the big oil companies , " @entity6 said in the @entity29			2
" ... i think it 's time they got by without more help from taxpayers , who are having a tough enough time paying their bills and filling up their tanks			0
" after the vote , @entity15 press secretary @entity40 labeled the result " unfortunate			1
" poll : @entity22 increasingly worried about gas prices a @entity1 / @entity46 poll ( @entity47 ) released thursday shows a majority of @entity22 blame oil companies -- rather than the @entity6 administration -- for the high gas prices			2
according to the survey , conducted last weekend , seven in 10 @entity22 say rising gas prices have caused hardship for them and their families			0
@entity6 's energy policy , which emphasizes investment in alternative sources , has repeatedly been attacked by @entity2 as contributing to high gas prices and stunting domestic oil development			1
the president has targeted the roughly $ 2 billion a year in tax breaks and subsidies for oil companies as a potential new revenue source for clean energy development			1
in his remarks thursday , @entity6 emphasized steps his administration has taken to boost domestic oil and natural gas production , seeking to deflect the @entity2 criticism			1
he said that now is the time to choose whether to continue to give unneeded subsidies to a thriving industry or to make critical investments in other energy sources			2
" instead of taxpayer giveaways to an industry that 's never been more profitable , we should be using that money to double down on investments in clean energy technologies that have never been more promising , " @entity6 said			1
" investments in wind power and solar power and biofuels ; in fuel - efficient cars and trucks and homes and buildings			0
that 's the only way we 'll break this cycle of high gas prices that happens year after year after year as the economy is growing			0
" to end his statement , @entity6 declared his belief in the nation 's ability to rise to any challenge and become the leader of a new global energy industry in the coming century			1
he framed the oil subsidy vote as a choice between that vision and protecting the status quo , adding : " today , the @entity22 people are going to be watching @entity27 to see if they have that same faith			2
" @entity6 defends his policy on oil pipeline the @entity5 - sponsored @entity3 measure -- which was opposed by most conservatives -- would have repealed subsidies currently benefiting @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120			1
savings would have been used to renew various alternative clean energy initiatives and reduce the deficit			1
@entity5 sought to cast republicans as defenders of unpopular big oil companies , while @entity2 highlighted rising pump prices on @entity6 's watch			1
senate minority leader @entity129 , @entity130 , complained thursday morning that the upcoming vote amounted to political theater because everyone , including the sponsors , knew it would have no effect on gas prices			0
" day after day after day , @entity5 ask us all to come out here , not so we can make an actual difference in the lives of working @entity22 and families struggling to fill the gas tank , but so we can watch them stage votes for show , " @entity137 said			0
" for some reason , they thought they could put political points on the board if the @entity22 people saw them voting for a tax hike that we all knew ahead of time did n't have the votes to pass			0
" his @entity5 counterpart , senate majority leader @entity154 of @entity156 , opened debate on the oil subsidy measure monday by noting that big oil companies are " making money hand over fist			2
" " if @entity2 continue to stand up for oil companies making record profits , one thing will be obvious : @entity2 care less about bringing down gas prices than about helping big oil companies that do n't need the help , " @entity154 said			2
he insisted that repealing " wasteful subsidies " would n't lead to a hike in oil and gas prices -- an assertion dismissed by @entity2			1
energy secretary hammered on gas prices @entity5 have proposed " raising taxes on @entity22 energy manufacturers -- something common sense and basic economics tell us will lead to even higher prices at the pump , " @entity137 said wednesday			2
" frankly , i ca n't think of a better way to illustrate how completely out of touch they are on this issue			0
" @entity5 have repeatedly raised the issue of whether it is appropriate to provide tax subsidies for highly profitable oil and gas companies			1
legislation similar to the current bill was narrowly rejected by the @entity3 last may			2
among other things , the measure killed on thursday would have ended oil production 's categorization under the tax code as a form of domestic manufacturing eligible for a deduction worth 6 % of net income , according to @entity204 @entity5 sen. @entity203 , the bill 's author			1
the measure also would have prevented oil companies from claiming foreign royalty payments as a credit against @entity22 taxes , and cut the ability of companies to deduct numerous costs associated with the drilling process			0
" with oil prices over $ 100 per barrel , @entity217 does not need a taxpayer incentive to explore , " @entity203 's office asserted in a written statement			0
@entity220 , a senior tax adviser at the @entity222 , which represents oil interests in @entity0 , told @entity1 the bill unfairly targeted one industry			2
among other things , he noted that many industries currently qualify for the domestic manufacturing deduction at a higher rate of 9 %			0
" how is this a legitimate tax deduction for @entity231 or the @entity232 at 9 % and somehow it 's a ' subsidy ' for the oil and natural gas industry at a lesser 6 % ? the answer is it 's not , " he said			0
" we 're already penalized			0
" repealing the royalty payment credit would be tantamount to double taxation and could cripple @entity22 - based operations , he argued			0
" raising taxes will not lower energy prices for @entity22 families and business , " the @entity222 's president , @entity241 , said in a written statement			0
" it 's time to work together on a national energy strategy that focuses on developing all @entity22 energy resources			0
" in the short term , bills such as the one blocked on thursday are unlikely to affect gas prices or change the market enough to shift voter attitudes , argued @entity255 , founder of @entity256 , an energy and investment advisory firm			0
" the global oil market has more impact on the presidential election than the president has on the global oil market , " @entity255 said .			0
