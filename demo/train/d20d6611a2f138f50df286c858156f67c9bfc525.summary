-- the 30 - mile highway from @entity2 to @entity3 in northern @entity4 is a no - man 's - land dotted with motley gatherings of thousands of displaced families , caught between the cruelty of @entity10 forces and targeted by militias backed by @entity4 's government			1
in august , these people lived in towns around @entity3 and @entity15 , at the epicenter of fighting in which the militias , @entity4 security forces and @entity20 , assisted by @entity22 - led airstrikes , supposedly drove @entity10 forces ( @entity10 calls itself the @entity23 ) from the area			1
no one stayed to protect civilians from the aftermath ; their homes were looted and burned by militias , they say , after @entity10 pulled out			2
now , several thousand families from this region , about 90 kilometers south of @entity32 , are eking out an existence in makeshift shelters along the road , caught between contested territory and the mountains leading to the relative safety of @entity4 's @entity20 region			1
at a defunct chicken factory , i met some 40 families who said they had been living there for two months without a visit , let alone any assistance , from humanitarian organizations or government officials			1
despite warnings from international aid agencies about deteriorating conditions for people displaced by conflict in other parts of @entity4 , these communities have been overlooked			1
their current residences -- the chicken factory , a school , makeshift tents -- are too dangerous to visit , according to representatives of local humanitarian organizations			1
a woman named @entity62 says that like many of the people forced from the towns around @entity3 and @entity15 , she was displaced twice : first when @entity10 entered her town and warned of an impending battle , and then when militias attacked the village to which she had fled with her husband and three small children			1
" we did n't get to stay there very long , " @entity62 said of the village			2
after a week she saw dozens of @entity74 , armored vehicles and pickup trucks approaching			2
she watched , terrified , as " so , so many " pro-government militiamen dressed in black piled out carrying automatic weapons			2
" they started shooting in the air and at the ground , they just wanted to scare us out of there , " she said			2
but the militia leniency did n't last very long			2
after driving @entity10 fighters from the area between @entity2 and @entity15 , the militias began looting and burning homes			2
families described how , after running for their lives , they sat on a hillside overlooking their towns and watched them burn			0
militias have emptied almost 80 towns of their @entity98 residents , a sheikh in @entity32 told me			0
other sheikhs , security and government officials , and some of those displaced have said the same			1
yet none of the displaced from these towns has received aid , he said			1
the sheikh said that militiamen forced him out by setting fire to his home and scrawling their unit names on his walls well after @entity10 had left the area : the @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , and @entity118			0
these are all powerful @entity120 militias with high - level representatives in @entity4 's government			1
at the chicken factory , @entity62 gestured to the industrial equipment in a small room where she sleeps alongside 16 relatives			0
" look at where we 're living , " she said in disgust			0
the area is particularly windy and rains have become heavier as winter approaches			0
" when we left , we barely had time to take anything with us ; we 're sharing blankets , " she said			0
" we 're running out of food and water and we 're running out of money			0
how will we survive the winter ? " not only are these displaced families exposed to the elements , but they also are still caught perilously between @entity10 and the militias			1
one man living in a makeshift camp nearby told me militiamen picked him up a couple of days earlier but released him " because they decided i was too old			0
" but many of his neighbors remain detained , he said			0
recently , the @entity153 humanitarian agency , the @entity151 , or @entity151 , launched a plan to help displaced persons in @entity4 , requesting $ 1.6 billion and noting that " early contributions [ are ] essential with the onset of winter			1
" but even if it raises funds , it is unlikely that @entity151 or its humanitarian partners will be able to reach the people who most desperately need help in time to save them			1
the @entity22 and @entity4 governments are supporting displaced people in relatively safe areas , but will they be able to reach the 40 families i met -- or others in hazardous conditions -- in time to save them from freezing or starving to death this winter ? given that the @entity4 government and @entity22 - led coalition created the conditions these people are living -- by attacking their areas and often leaving them to the mercy of the militias -- the same governments should now step in to facilitate humanitarian access , lest history makes their " liberation " operation look more like a pathway to a massacre			1
as i left the chicken factory , children swarmed around me , giggling and wanting to show me how they slept like chickens packed into a room			0
as much as i wanted to , i could n't spare the time			0
i had already stayed dangerously long and the risk that someone hostile to my presence had noticed -- whether @entity10 or a militiaman -- was just too high			0
i left the factory and its tenants behind , just as they remain out of reach and abandoned by the international community , the authorities in @entity197 and the @entity198 .			0

conditions are deteriorating for many displaced in @entity4 , says @entity205
governments should facilitate humanitarian access , @entity205 says
@entity151 has launched a plan to help displaced persons in @entity4 , she says
