looking pale , thin and emotional , @entity0 was reunited with his family tuesday after more than five years in captivity			1
now he faces what is likely to be a bewildering few days , weeks and months as he readjusts to a life of liberty			0
while no one yet knows exactly what he went through , other captives ' experiences give an insight into his likely state of mind -- and suggest that although he has his freedom , other challenges lie ahead			0
only 19 at the time of his capture in june 2006 , @entity0 was known to few outside his circle of family , friends and fellow soldiers			1
but after years spent in virtual isolation , he has been thrust into the limelight and faces a barrage of media attention			0
speaking to @entity25 television shortly after his release , @entity0 said he had missed his family and friends			1
" i missed interacting with normal people , " he told the interviewer			0
a few details emerged later as his father , @entity0 , addressed the throng of reporters gathered outside the family 's home in northern @entity36			1
his son felt good , he said , but was suffering the effects of small shrapnel wounds received long ago but never properly treated , as well as a lack of sunlight			1
while @entity0 was very happy to be home , it was difficult for him to be exposed to so many people after so long in isolation , unable to speak to anyone in his own language , @entity0 said			1
" he basically came out of a dark hole , a dark basement , and came out of that to this great crowd , " he said , adding that it must have been amazing for his son to see such a show of support from their village and the country			2
the family had greeted @entity0 with big hugs , he said , but so far they had had little chance to do more than eat together in what had been an exhausting day			1
" he said in the beginning the conditions were difficult and he was n't particularly well treated , but more recently things improved , " he said of his son , adding that he was sure the family would learn more over time			0
@entity67 , an @entity36 clinical psychologist and former prisoner of war based near @entity69 , told @entity70 that @entity0 may continue to feel isolated despite being back among loved ones			1
" i think the most difficult thing he will have to cope with is that he has been going through an experience that is very difficult to communicate , to explain to the ordinary person , " he said			0
but @entity67 said it was a good sign that @entity0 had expressed a wish to talk about his ordeal			1
" that will help his readjustment as long as it comes from him and is not solicited by the media or other people , " he said			0
@entity67 , who was held for 40 days in an @entity25 jail following the @entity84 in 1973 , said his own experience was made easier by being held with fellow prisoners and , on his release , returning to the familiarity of his army unit			0
but @entity0 has been kept in virtual isolation			1
and his long captivity has not only affected him but also the family members who have " gone through hell " by extension , as they feared for his safety and fought for his freedom , @entity67 said			0
" it will be difficult to adjust to normal life			0
he will have to find out what it is because it 's not what he left five years ago			0
it 's a completely different life , different family , " @entity67 said			0
" everybody is involved with the trauma			0
" he suggests that what @entity0 will most need is time and a period of peace and privacy to come to terms with what he has experienced			1
but unlike some prisoners of war in previous decades , @entity0 will not have to deal with the trauma alone			1
@entity36 has many professionals who can provide support and advice based on the experiences of others who have been held captive , @entity67 said , and there is an enormous desire in @entity36 to see him recover fully			2
while little is known about @entity0 's day - to - day conditions , the fact he appears healthy -- if thin and wan -- is promising , said @entity125 , a physician and retired @entity127 wing commander who was part of a clinical team that rehabilitated @entity131 hostages released from @entity132 in 1991 , among them @entity134 , a former envoy to the archbishop of @entity136			1
but medical professionals will need to monitor @entity0 's sleep and weight patterns for signs he is suffering post-traumatic stress disorder , said @entity125 , now medical director for the @entity131 veterans ' charity combat stress			1
if he was blindfolded or had disrupted sleep or irregular meals during his captivity , @entity0 will need to adjust , @entity125 said			2
weight loss can also be an indicator of other ill treatment , he added			0
the soldier 's youth may have been a disadvantage , he said , as evidence shows the young and old are more vulnerable to developing ptsd			2
but if those around him are vigilant , any lasting effects can be mitigated			0
" the other thing that is important is to make him feel in control , " he said			0
" what we did with the @entity162 hostages was give them a watch			0
it was probably the first thing taken away from him -- and it would be one of the first things i 'd give back , to give him a time reference for day or night			0
" it would be better if @entity0 were kept away from the media for a few days , @entity125 said , in order for him to adjust before speaking publicly			2
@entity0 may also feel a sense of dissociation after being kept in virtual isolation , he warned			2
while in captivity , @entity0 had access some of the time to newspapers and to a radio , according to @entity178			2
gen. @entity179 , a spokesman for the @entity181 , but he was a young , apparently shy man cut off from all who knew him			0
nothing is yet known of the personal resources @entity0 found to keep hope alive during the years he was held by @entity186			1
but he may have found some comfort in the assurances given by @entity36 's military that it will always do its utmost to secure the return of its soldiers			1
" the principle of returning pows , mias , kidnapped and fallen @entity181 personnel has been sacrosanct since the @entity181 's inception in 1948 , " the @entity36 @entity195 website says			1
" the @entity181 does all in its power to locate its captured personnel and free them			0
" @entity36 prime minister @entity203 reiterated that commitment in his remarks after @entity0 's release			1
referring to his own military service , @entity203 said : " i always knew that if i or one of my comrades fell captive , the government of @entity36 would do its utmost to return us home , and as prime minister , i have now carried this out			1
as a leader who daily sends out soldiers to defend @entity36 citizens , i believe that mutual responsibility is no mere slogan -- it is a cornerstone of our existence here			2
" @entity219 , a researcher on health and detention for @entity222 , told @entity70 there was good reason to be hopeful for @entity0 's future well - being now he was back home			1
" we should n't underestimate people 's resilience , " he said			0
" there 's a tendency to look on the gloomy side when we hear about people being released , but people do have amazing resources , so they can survive things quite well			2
" of course , @entity0 is not alone in celebrating his freedom tuesday			2
the 477 @entity238 prisoners released by @entity36 in exchange for @entity0 were also reunited with family and friends -- many of them after long periods in detention			1
hundreds more will be released in a second stage later this year			2
while the circumstances are not the same , those prisoners -- including hundreds serving life sentences for attacks on @entity36 -- will also face a significant period of adjustment after their rapturous reception by tens of thousands of supporters in @entity254 and elsewhere			1
@entity186 official @entity255 welcomed their release , but said it was not enough			2
" we are all shedding two tears : one tear for the release of all of our fighters , and a tear of pain for all of our brothers still in prison , " he said			0
@entity0 's father , @entity267 , also reflected on the pain felt by @entity36 who have watched those convicted of attacks on their loved ones leave jail early			1
@entity273 , an @entity275 - @entity274 journalist who was released four months into an eight - year jail term after being convicted of spying in @entity275 , offered some advice to freed @entity274 hikers @entity280 and @entity280 last month that may also be of use to @entity0 as he seeks to make sense of his new reality			1
she urged them not to rush things , telling @entity70 : " i hope that they are able to adapt well in this new part of their life and perhaps learned lessons in prison that can help them when they 're free			0
" i would tell them to take their time and not feel pressured to make decisions			0
