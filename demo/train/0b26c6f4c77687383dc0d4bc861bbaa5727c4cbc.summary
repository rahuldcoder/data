-- these days , people do n't want to take a vacation from gaming			0
and it 's changing the way companies like @entity7 are building their $ 900 million floating cities			0
@entity7 launches its newest ship , the @entity10 , out of @entity11 , @entity12 , this week			1
on the sister ship to the @entity15 , @entity13 have created interactive experiences that ca n't be played anywhere else -- including @entity7 theme parks			1
" because technology has become more progressive in the home , it challenges us as @entity20 to design experiences for guests that they ca n't do at home , " said @entity19 , a senior show producer for @entity20			1
" with the @entity30 , you take a piece of video wall technology , put it on the floor , and you make it an interactive experience that 's very physical in nature			1
" the @entity30 , which is available on both the @entity38 , is made up of 32 high - definition displays that push 14 million pixels , which is n't something that 's going to be replicated on an @entity42 or @entity43			0
this massive floor puts arcade games like " @entity46 " to shame and allows up to 32 kids ( 16 adults ) to gather around the edges and interact with the video games that unfold on the screens by using their feet or hands			1
around the border of these displays are light pad controllers			0
there are 48 sensors in each controller that detect the location , the motion and the proximity of each player			1
of course , these games are based on hit @entity7 movies like " tron : @entity67 , " " @entity68 " and " @entity69			2
" each ship has two of these interactive floors on board in the @entity74 and @entity75 for kids and tweens			1
" we have magical appearances through our living character program , where stitch from ' @entity68 ' and crush from ' @entity84 ' appear in the spaces on screen and interact and talk live with the kids , " said @entity78 , creative director for @entity79 and @entity80			2
" it really is an amazing experience for the little ones to see them make a pizza with the @entity30 while stitch talks to them in real - time			0
" in those same play areas , kids can also interact with @entity98 , which are roughly the size of a foosball table			2
what separates this video game machine from anything else is that it offers full touch - screen interaction and exclusive games developed by @entity13 based on films like " @entity108 " and " cars			1
" all of the games have been designed for up to four players			1
" we 've designed these experiences to empower kids to go in and just do fun stuff , " @entity19 said			1
with more passengers now accustomed to playing games on @entity118 , including the new " @entity119 , " @entity13 are creating experiences that blend motion sensor technology and storytelling			1
the @entity10 introduces a @entity124 game as part of the @entity127 catalog of experiences			2
@entity128 , interactive show producer at @entity20 , headed the team that developed the new @entity124 game , which features original video of @entity133 , @entity134 and the rest of the gang			2
she said that many members of her team have a game design and software development background and they keep abreast of new technology like @entity142			2
the @entity127 , which also includes two additional games ( also available on the dream ) featuring @entity145 and his pals , was developed using facial capture technology and motion capture technology similar to @entity142			1
" a key part of the interactive experience is the detective badge , which has a specific agent number and a special bar code , " explained @entity149			2
" each person has a unique bar code , so when you go up to a piece of art , it senses the bar code and will know what scene you 're on and what game you 're playing on			0
depending on what piece of art you 're going to , you 'll see a different scene customized to where you are in the game			0
" the game , which sends players to all areas of the ship , is actually an additional level of interactivity that enhances @entity175 pieces			1
guests who stand in front of this art will see animation come to life			0
there are video games built into the different stations , which require players to turn the badge to manipulate on - screen items like lighting fireworks and tightening pipes with a wrench			1
the @entity124 game adds a lie detector to the equation , which offers additional interactivity with characters			0
( the @entity10 is also showing he @entity124 ' new movie in its @entity195			0
) the @entity10 adds a golf simulator to the mix on @entity199 's @entity198			0
designed for avid golfers , this video game features 80 authentic courses that are displayed on a giant screen inside an air - conditioned room on one of the upper decks			2
players choose from real @entity209 golf clubs and swing an actual ball into the screen			2
" the system uses motion sensors and infrared lines that intertwine with each other , " explained @entity212 , assistant port of interest manager on the @entity10			0
" the ball goes though this system , and the angles are calculated as it passes from one line to the next , and then the ball enters the video game screen and proceeds into the course			0
it 's designed so you can do everything from play a full game to just practice putting or go to the driving range			0
" for younger passengers , the room houses an adjacent simulator			0
utilizing the same motion sensor and infrared technology , passengers can pick from hockey , football , soccer and baseball and use actual balls to interact with @entity199 and the gang			1
interactivity is spread throughout the ship , including a new dinner show at @entity246 that allows guests to draw an animated figure and then watch it come to life with classic @entity7 characters			0
@entity19 said that just as there 's been an influx of passengers who game , there are more imagineers that have grown up playing games			0
that 's influencing the types of experiences that are being designed for vacationers .			1

each ship has two interactive floors on board for kids and tweens
