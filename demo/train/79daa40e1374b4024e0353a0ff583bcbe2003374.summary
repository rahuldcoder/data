-- " @entity1 that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character			0
" i was not yet four years old when dr. @entity10 spoke those words on the steps of the @entity13			1
but in a way i have lived my life as if i were one of those children			0
for more than 40 years i have fought to make this country a place where those words would be true for all of us , where all @entity21 can be dr. @entity10 's spiritual grandchildren			1
i am not naÃ ¯ ve enough to think that with the election of @entity27 racism has disappeared from @entity21			2
in fact , according to a new @entity29 , racism has increased since 2008			2
according to the poll , " 51 % of @entity21 now express explicit anti-black attitudes , compared with 48 % in a similar 2008 survey			1
" the three percentage point rise is not large , and within the poll 's margin of error			1
but , at the very least , it indicates we have not reached the post-racial world that some hoped @entity27 's election would usher in			1
and the prejudice is n't limited to blacks : 52 % openly express anti-hispanic sentiments			2
the numbers go up when measured by an implicit racial attitudes test			1
that is , when the survey takes into account the " dog - whistles , " the new buzz word for code language only those " tuned in " will hear , anti-black sentiment is 56 % and anti-hispanic sentiment is 57 %			1
opinion : do n't let superstorm sway your vote this racism has consequences			2
@entity64 , an assistant solicitor general during the @entity66 administration and now executive director of the @entity68 think tank , told the @entity29 that negative racial attitudes affect " the way people are treated by police , the way kids are treated by teachers , the way home - seekers are treated by landlords and real estate agents			1
" the racial divide increasingly reflects the generation gap			2
according to the ninth annual @entity86 report , published by the @entity88 - based group , @entity82 , " increasingly elderly @entity21 do not identify with young @entity21 who are far more racially and ethnically diverse , leading to reductions in future - oriented public investments			0
" the report notes that almost half of @entity21 under 18 are minorities and 80 % of retirees are white			0
by 2030 , the majority of those under 18 will be people of color , and by 2042 nonwhites will be the majority of the population			0
and as has become obvious in this campaign , the racial and generational divide is driven by the economic divide			1
in simple terms , the older white population has accumulated more of the wealth			0
the key political question is how they relate to and interact with a younger , more diverse -- and yes , more tolerant -- demographic			0
@entity110 : let 's get real about abortions this may explain @entity115 's recent comment			1
explain , but not excuse			0
in an interview with @entity0 's @entity118 , former @entity116 gov. @entity115 said , when asked about gen. @entity120 's endorsement of @entity27 , " you have to wonder whether that 's an endorsement based on issues or that he 's got a slightly different reason for supporting president @entity27 ... i think that when you have somebody of your own race that you 're proud of being president of the @entity21 , i applaud @entity120 for standing with him			1
" the wording is a well - constructed dog - whistle			0
it 's also tone - deaf			0
what 's meant to deflect criticism -- " somebody of your own race that you 're proud of ... i applaud @entity120 " -- sends a different signal : condescending and contemptuous			1
just how condescending and contemptuous is easy to see if we reverse it : @entity115 is endorsing former @entity139 gov. @entity138 not because of policies or philosophy , but because both are old , rich and white			2
either formulation should make us very uncomfortable			0
opinion : what is presidential greatness ? in fact , @entity120 gave cogent , powerful reasons for his endorsement			2
he noted the difficulty of the recession , the job losses , the fiscal implosion , the unemployment and auto industry collapse			0
he said that he 'd seen " stabilization ... in the financial community , housing ... starting to pick up ... consumer confidence rising			0
" on foreign affairs , @entity120 said president @entity27 has gotten us out of one war , started to get us out of a second and that the president 's actions " with respect to protecting us from terrorism have been very , very solid			1
" @entity120 also explained why he was not endorsing @entity138 : " the governor was saying things at the debate on [ foreign affairs ] that were quite different from what he said earlier ... as i listen to what his proposals are ... with respect to the economy , it 's essentially let 's cut taxes and compensate for that with other things			1
" those responding to @entity115 's racist dog - whistle miss a critical point : each of us has a history -- be it racial , ethnic , religious -- that is a source of pride and sorrow			1
our heritage helps shape our identity			0
but neither history nor heritage defines an individual 's character			0
only the individual 's actions can do that			0
in human terms , what - you - see - is - what - you - get refers not to something superficial or external , but to what a person does , for character is expressed in action			0
are we honest ; are we just ; are we compassionate ? where are our acts of goodness and kindness ? what a shame that some who would lead , whether in politics or the media , still pretend otherwise			0
@entity120 argued about character ; @entity115 insinuated about race			1
and dr. @entity10 's dream is still not yet a reality			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			2

@entity227 : this country should be one where dr. @entity10 's *vision* of racial equality prevails
but she says new poll shows rise in anti-black , anti-hispanic attitudes , far from post-racial
she says other report showed generational divide in attitudes to growing minority population
@entity227 : remarks like @entity115 's about gen. @entity120 stoke and reflect this *tenacious* racism
