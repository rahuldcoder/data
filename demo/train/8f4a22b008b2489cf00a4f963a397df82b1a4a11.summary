-- getting arrested for stealing cars after his 16th birthday may be the best thing that ever happened to @entity5			0
serving time in @entity7 's juvenile justice system set @entity5 on the path to college			1
it got him out of gangs and headed to college			0
while in one of @entity7 's juvenile facilities , @entity5 became editor of its student newspaper , captain of the football team and made the honor roll			1
" i wanted something different for myself or i 'd end up in @entity22 doing nothing			0
i knew i could do something , " said @entity5 , who is the first in his family to go to college			0
now he 's a sophomore studying criminal justice at the @entity28			2
@entity5 was n't scared straight			2
he was n't packed away in a crowded facility with steel bars and razor wire			1
he was n't under the constant guard of uniformed officers with billy clubs or locked down with hundreds of other juveniles			2
instead , he was sent to @entity36 , one of @entity7 's 32 residential facilities where he wore his jeans and t - shirts			1
he slept in his own bunk bed in a room that looks more like a dorm than a jail cell			0
he received counseling and schooling			0
while @entity49 's juvenile system is often criticized for corruption and abuse , @entity7 state officials say its juvenile justice solution has saved billions of dollars and reduced the number of repeat offenders			1
in the last four decades , the state has transformed its juvenile system into one that defies the traditional prison model			1
known as the @entity7 model , the program focuses on therapy , comfortable living conditions and an emphasis on job training and education			1
@entity7 's facilities are serving thousands of young offenders , and they are receiving national acclaim			1
each offender is placed in a small group of 10 to 15 , assigned a case worker and sent to school during the day			2
offenders also put on @entity76 stage productions and play sports			2
they learn about teamwork through camping and rock climbing			0
" young people are really turning their lives around and becoming productive citizens , " said @entity81 , director of @entity82			0
" we 've redefined what 's possible in the juvenile justice system			2
" several states including @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 are trying to emulate the @entity7 model			1
@entity95 's troubled juvenile detention center , @entity96 , which once housed some of the most serious teen offenders , was shut down in 2009 and rebuilt to copy the @entity7 model			1
@entity7 has changed , too			2
the state once relied on a punitive system that warehoused offenders in harsh conditions			0
for nearly a century , the @entity103 for boys in @entity105 was a dark place known for beatings , rapes and even deaths			0
at one point , it was crammed with 650 offenders			0
even judges hesitated sending children to @entity105			0
it was closed in 1983 and transformed into an adult prison			0

@entity120 heads the @entity125 , a consulting agency that helps other states implement the @entity7 model			1
under the @entity7 model , juveniles who commit minor crimes such as skipping school or trespassing are placed in low - security , renovated houses or cottages with 10 other kids			1
the small group size allows staffers to work more effectively with individual offenders			2
delinquents who commit violent crimes are placed in gated facilities that hold a maximum of 50 offenders but offer the same small group atmosphere and focus on rehabilitation			2
these offenders are broken into smaller groups and also receive counseling and go to school on site			2
most juveniles work on community service projects during their stay			0
instead of serving sentences of weeks , months or years , a juvenile in @entity7 can win release through good behavior and demonstrated progress			1
@entity7 officials say the small group size may be the reason why there has n't been a suicide in their residences in 25 years			1
the federal government has reported hundreds of suicide incidents involving juveniles in confinement			0
critics argue the @entity7 model 's residential centers are too soft on juvenile delinquents and that some youths may never become law abiding citizens			1
" there are victims who certainly feel more is needed to help the child fully understand the consequences of their actions , " said @entity174 , executive director of @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity7			2
@entity182 said some adult criminals may take advantage of a juvenile system that does n't appear to be as punitive as the traditional juvenile model			1
adult gang members may ask juveniles to take the blame if they know that the punishment wo n't be that harsh , she said			0
@entity7 's @entity193 staff admits that a small percentage of juveniles will continue breaking the law despite going through the program			1
but some research on the @entity199 has shown promising results			0
a recent analysis by the @entity202 found that about 9 percent of juveniles in @entity7 get in trouble with the law again within three years of their release			1
by contrast , about 28 percent of @entity209 's juvenile offenders were back in trouble within three years			1
the program has survived scrutiny from tough - on - crime conservative leaders such as former @entity7 gov. @entity215 , who later served as attorney general in the @entity218 administration			2
the @entity7 model has saved the state billions of dollars , said @entity221 , who heads the adult @entity222			1
he credits the @entity7 model 's low recidivism rate with slowing prison population growth			1
as a result , the state did n't have to build three prisons			0
more than 370 of the juveniles who went through the @entity82 graduated from high school this year compared to just 40 children when the program began in earnest in 1983 , according to state officials			0
" i had wanted to go to college " said @entity235 , a 21 - year - old senior at the @entity236			0
@entity235 , a teen who abused alcohol was sent to a facility for girls in 2005 for behavioral problems			0
" but i just never thought it would actually happen			0
" today , she is planning to apply to law school .			0

a *handful* of other states are trying to replicate the @entity7 model
studies show only ten percent of @entity7 's youth *re-offend*
