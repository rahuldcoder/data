-- @entity3 's @entity2 app could be a lot closer to launch than we thought			1
a full - sized , fully - functional version of the @entity2 app is hidden inside the current @entity9 app. that means that , if you are running the @entity9 app you already have the @entity2 executable on your phone			1
discovered by @entity15 , @entity16 writer for @entity18 's @entity17 , the @entity2 app is a lot more modern - looking than the tired old @entity9 version , and looks a lot like @entity23 's official @entity2 app. on the left is a source list to navigate between your @entity27 , info , photos and friends sections			1
up top , below the status bar , you 'll find more icons to take you to different sections ( places and chat , amongst others ) , and if you flip to horizontal orientation you get a combination of both these navigation " aids , " and the top - bar nav icons remain			1

" the discovery was made by a an engineering student named @entity53 , who also gives instructions on how to get it running on your own @entity2			0
if you are smart enough to know what that means , and yet you still use @entity3 , then go ahead and hack away			0
the rest of us can either wait for the official launch , or wait for @entity62 to release @entity63 for the @entity2			2
