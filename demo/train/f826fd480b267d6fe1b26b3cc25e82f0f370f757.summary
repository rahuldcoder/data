@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity7 students and faculty at @entity1 universities fear for their safety on campus because of threats aimed at them over the @entity14 conflict , the father of a slain @entity5 reporter said friday			2
@entity15 , the father of slain reporter @entity16 , says anti-semitism is on rise on college campuses			1
@entity15 , whose son , @entity16 , was kidnapped and killed by @entity22 extremists while on assignment in @entity24 in 2002 , told reporters at a news conference that anti-semitic e-mail and verbal threats have escalated since @entity30 's three - week invasion of @entity31 in january			1
@entity32 teaches computer science on @entity36 's @entity35 campus			1
on the school 's web site , @entity36 chancellor @entity37 issued a statement about the university 's policy			1
" the conflict in the @entity14 and current events in @entity31 are some of the most highly controversial issues of our time , stirring deep emotions on all sides , " the statement read			1
" we have a responsibility to protect the freedom of expression			0
we also all have a responsibility to listen and engage -- respectfully -- even as we must understand that not every campus forum on a controversial topic will satisfy passionate and concerned members of the campus and broader communities , " said @entity37			0
@entity32 and officials at the @entity60 , where the news conference was held , are concerned that administrators on college campuses across the country are not doing enough to foster freedom of expression while protecting @entity7 students and faculty members from acts of intimidation on campuses			1
" the verbal abuse is there , the intimidation is there , the feeling of helplessness is there , not only among students but among faculty , " said @entity32			1
@entity32 cited an incident several years ago in which he was threatened			1
" i received hate messages from someone at @entity36 who did not identify himself and said , ' i saw you in @entity87 and i know where your office is and i 'm going to beat the ( expletive ) out of you , ' " @entity32 said			1
" i handed it to the campus police , and they did not do anything			2
" @entity36 spokeswoman @entity93 told @entity2 there is no record of @entity32 's complaint to campus police but said the university plans to meet with him			1
@entity60 officials cited another incident three weeks ago at @entity102 where the consul general of @entity30 was verbally abused and forcibly driven from the stage during a guest - speaking engagement aimed at fostering understanding of @entity7 culture			0
the diplomat , @entity108 , had to be escorted out of the room by security officers and campus police before the event ended , according to rabbi @entity113 of the @entity60 and @entity114 , president of @entity115 for @entity30 , the group which co-sponsored the speaking event			2
" we were extremely concerned about our safety and mr. @entity108 's safety , " said @entity114 , a senior majoring in political science			2
" mr. @entity108 said he 's never felt more disrespected			2
this was clearly an infringement of our expression of free speech			0
i think a lot of @entity7 students do not feel safe on campuses because of the escalation of hate perpetrated against @entity7			0
" @entity102 spokeswoman @entity132 told @entity2 the sponsors of the event were responsible for moderating the speaking forum but maintained that officers and security personnel acted appropriately			0
in a statement , the university president @entity139 defended the university 's policies but expressed concern about the event			0
" our campus places high value on the free exchange of ideas in a manner that is inclusive and respectful of differing views , " the statement read			0
" at a recent campus event , numerous members of the audience with views differing from the invited speaker were so vocal in their expression of opposition and so uncooperative with the moderator 's requests for orderly means of handling questions and answers that they disrupted the event and did not allow the speaker to respond to posed questions			0
the university fully endorses the free expression of ideas and opinion , but does not condone behavior and methods of expression that disrupt free and orderly discussion			0
" as part of an effort to promote tolerance , the @entity60 announced plans to unveil a public service campaign next month which will be distributed online at @entity178 , @entity36 , @entity179 , @entity102 and the @entity180 , among other campuses			2
" there are a lot of @entity7 kids in @entity1 and elsewhere who are beginning to look elsewhere and saying maybe the @entity180 system is not a user friendly place to go and we ca n't accept that , " said @entity113 .			0
