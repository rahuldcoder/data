-- @entity1 may not have closed its doors for good after all : @entity5 is currently in talks with @entity7 for a sixth season of the recently cancelled " @entity9 , " a source close to the show tells @entity0			1
( deadline first reported the news			0
) @entity7 and @entity5 are n't commenting , and another source stressed caution about such a deal , but a proposed plan would likely include a 13 - episode new season of the community college meta - comedy , with creator @entity18 in the fold			2
if by chance an agreement were reached , it would push the show past the 100 - episode milestone ( it 's at 97 ) , and , of course , bring it one crucial step closer to fulfilling fans ' rally cries of " six seasons and a movie			1
" @entity0 : ' @entity9 ' canceled @entity5 is a logical destination for the show , as it already owns the exclusive digital rights to the " @entity9 's " first five seasons			1
( the off - network rights belong to @entity36			0
) the streaming service is committed to expanding its original programming , which currently includes shows like @entity40 , deadbeat and @entity41 , as well as @entity44 's upcoming @entity43 parody @entity45 of @entity46 , but original episodes of @entity9 would put @entity48 — with its six million subscribers — on the map in a bigger way , much like the revival of @entity53 did for @entity54			2
earlier this month , @entity55 officially cut bait on " @entity9 , " whose fifth season averaged 3.8 million viewers and a 1.6 rating in the 18 - to - 49 - year - old demographic , including dvr playback			1
@entity18 has kept expectations in check about the possibility of the show — which had made scoring a last - minute renewal from @entity55 an annual rite — finding a second life elsewhere			1
responding to the cancellation news on his blog , he said he was open to making more episodes ( " i 'm not going to be the guy who recancels cancelled @entity9 " ) but also noted : " [ @entity73 ] here are lots of reasons a @entity9 resurrection could be difficult			0
so be prepared for that			0
