while some younger people may know him best as the father of former @entity19 and @entity21 linebacker @entity20 , the elder @entity2 was one of the most prominent figures in all of sports during the 1970s -- in large part because of his consistently great bouts with @entity5			1

but @entity5 got his revenge six months later , winning their rematch in another split decision			2
when @entity2 broke @entity5 's jaw the two fighters faced off one more time in 1976 at @entity37 's @entity36 , with @entity5 again taking the win in what @entity40 's website calls " a highly disputed split decision			1

the year he left , in 1967 , @entity2 went pro. it took him six more years to get a shot at a championship against @entity5 , and he won			1
while he lost that title back to @entity5 later the same year , a first - round knockout of @entity72 earned @entity2 the honor of being champ again in 1977			1
that same year , the @entity76 named @entity40 its @entity77			0
still , that championship also proved short - lived after @entity40 lost a grueling 15 - round fight to @entity80			0
he retired from boxing in 1981 after amassing a professional record of 42 wins ( including 33 knockouts ) , seven losses and one draw			2
the @entity88 inducted @entity2 in 1992 , hailing him as " a fixture in the heavyweight ranks during a time that many consider the finest era of the division			2
" his profile on the hall 's websites notes @entity2 " possessed an awkward and powerful style and always entered the ring in great condition			2

@entity2 also became close friends with @entity5 , whom he visited in the hospital the day after their first bout			1
according to @entity14 , @entity5 told @entity2 , " you hit so hard			1
" his website also notes that @entity2 was once counted out before : in 1986 , when he refused to accept a doctor 's prognosis he would n't be able to walk or talk again after a serious accident			0
" at first they thought i might die , and if i did n't die , i would n't be coherent , " he said later			0
" now i 'm talkin ' and walkin ' and i can even chew gum at the same time			0
" his more recent health crisis , a stroke , left him communicating by blinking his eyes , @entity14 recalled			0
still , the former @entity5 manager said there was a lot of laughter in the room during @entity14 's visit along with other legendary boxers @entity142 , @entity143 and @entity144			1
