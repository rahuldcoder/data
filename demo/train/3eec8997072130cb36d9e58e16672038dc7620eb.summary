-- remember the @entity2 personal diary ? it had a lock on it , and after writing your thoughts about the day , it stayed tucked in a drawer			0
you talked about dreams and disappointments and school and love , and sometimes you culled it for phrases in the love letter you agonized over for a week before leaving it in the mailbox or locker of your interest			1
the last thing you wanted was for someone else to read it , at least not until the beloved saw it and said , " yes			0
" back in the old days , love was n't social , it was private			1
communication , not to mention courtship , seemed to take a long time			0
hours of contact with the loved one alternated with days alone with your longing			1
except for a close friend or two , you kept it secret until you were established as an " item , " and even then you maintained the border between private exchange and social identity as a couple			1
the medium of love -- the letter , the quiet walks , the rose , the kiss -- remained between you and your interest , and you did n't reproduce it for others			1
when you were apart , solitude hurt , but it made the time together all the more precious			0
today , with the spread of social media , the pain of separation is over , and so is the exclusivity of love			1
as @entity57 gets ready to go public and huge dollar amounts are discussed -- a $ 100 billion valuation , $ 5 billion in hoped - for sales , $ 100 per share , $ 1 billion in profits in 2011 -- ceo @entity61 and others have a very specific vision of the future			0
@entity57 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and all the other social media services coming and going are about changing , fundamentally and forever , the very nature of human experience			1
they want to socialize everything			0
here is how @entity74 , founder of @entity67 , the social network game developer , put it last year : " in five years , everybody will always be connected to each other , instead of the web			1
" @entity61 repeated the point : " if you look five years out			0
every industry is going to be rethought in a social way			1
and not just industries , but individuals , too ... and no matter where you go			0
we want to make it so that all those experiences can be social			1
" and when @entity92 named @entity61 its @entity93 , it summarized the goal of his company this way : " @entity57 wants to populate the wilderness , tame the howling mob and turn the lonely , antisocial world of random chance into a friendly world , a serendipitous world			0
you 'll be working and living inside a network of people , and you 'll never have to be alone again			0
" the vision does n't just provide social contact as an option in your daily affairs			1
it 's a requirementâ € ” " everybody , " " always , " " every industry , " " all those experiences , " " never have to be alone			1
" the numbers back them up			0
in 2010 @entity57 leapt from 337 million to 585 million users , with 7.9 new ones registered every second			0
@entity68 , the geolocation networking service , grew 3400 % in 2010 and reached 10 million users by june 2011			0
@entity66 logged 25 billion tweets in 2010 and teens with mobile devices ran up 3,339 text messages per month that year			0
more and more , it seems , every experience can be social , and pretty soon it will be social unless you become a hermit			1
it 's not just that social media does n't cure loneliness , which surprised social psychologists , it 's that love itself does n't survive socialization			1
if you write a love letter and leave it for her , but post it on @entity57 , too , your feelings disperse			2
the sentiments in the letter spread too thinly , and if she sees them elsewhere she wonders , " hey , i thought your love was meant for me			2
" if she posts your letter on @entity57 , you think the same thing			0
if both of you post the letter on @entity57 , well , love itself wastes away , just as any noble , feeling - full statement does when it turns into an advertising jingle			2
if you call him on the phone and hear him say for the first time , " i love you , too , " then hang up and text 20 friends and update @entity57 with , " he said it ! " you may think that you are expanding and replenishing his declaration , but in truth you only deplete it			2
this is a moment to savor and ponder by yourself , to let it exist for a time on its own			0
love ca n't run too swiftly or follow too many channels and last			1
@entity61 has noted that we are " hard - wired " to care about what other people think , to heed the interests and eyes of our companions			0
maybe so , but that does n't mean we should involve them in everything			2
that way leads to what @entity179 terms in an upcoming book , " digital vertigo , " the disorienting , enfeebling effect of social contact on personal experience			2
the faster you express your love and the more you share it with others , the less you do , in fact , love			2
we have gone from ' shall i compare thee to a summer 's day ' to smiley face emoticons , from beauteous and painstakingly crafted one - to - one disclosures of love to quick and @entity197 © d postings of love for all to see and ' like			2
' think of it this way : what great lover of the past , real or fictional -- @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 in @entity206 , queen @entity207 -- spotted the beloved for the first time and thought one second later , " i ca n't wait to tell all my friends " ? follow @entity212 on @entity66 join the conversation on @entity57 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			1

@entity216 : in the old days , love was n't social , it was private between couples
@entity216 : today , social media services want all human experiences to be social
psychologists have found that social media does n't actually cure loneliness
he says that genuine love is anti-social
