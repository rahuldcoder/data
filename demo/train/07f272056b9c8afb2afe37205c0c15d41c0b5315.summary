observers around the world are stunned by the speed and scope of this week 's assaults on every major city in the upper @entity6 -- including @entity7 , @entity8 's second - largest city -- by the @entity9 , or @entity9			1
but they should n't be			0
the collapse of the @entity8 government 's troops in @entity7 and other northern cities in the face of @entity16 militant resistance has been the predictable culmination of a long deterioration , brought on by the government 's politicization of its security forces			1
the politicization of the @entity8 military for more than five years , prime minister @entity24 and his ministers have presided over the packing of the @entity8 military and police with @entity30 loyalists -- in both the general officer ranks and the rank and file -- while sidelining many effective commanders who led @entity8 troops in the battlefield gains of 2007 - 2010 , a period during which @entity38 in @entity8 ( the forerunner of the @entity9 ) was brought to the brink of extinction			1
@entity24 's " @entity47 " of the @entity8 security forces has been less about the security of @entity8 than the security of @entity44 and his regime			1
even before the end of the @entity51 - led " surge " in 2008 , @entity24 began a concerted effort to replace effective @entity16 and @entity54 commanders and intelligence officers in the key mixed - sect areas of @entity44 , @entity57 and @entity59 provinces to ensure that @entity8 units focused on fighting @entity16 insurgents while leaving loyal @entity30 militias alone -- and to alleviate @entity24 's irrational fears of a military coup against his government			1
in 2008 , @entity24 began replacing effective @entity54 commanders and soldiers in @entity7 and @entity68 with @entity30 loyalists from @entity44 and the prime minister 's @entity70 , and even @entity30 militia members from the south			1
a number of nonloyalist commanders were forced to resign in the face of trumped up charges or reassigned to desk jobs and replaced with @entity24 loyalists			2
the moves were made to marginalize @entity16 and @entity81 in the north and entrench @entity24 's regime and the @entity70 ahead of provincial and national elections in 2009 , 2010 and 2013			1
the dismantling of the ' awakening ' it 's no accident that there exists today virtually no @entity16 popular resistance to @entity9 , but rather the result of a conscious @entity24 government policy to marginalize the @entity16 tribal " awakening " that deployed more than 90,000 @entity16 fighters against @entity38 in 2007 - 2008			1
these 90,000 " @entity101 " made a significant contribution to the reported 90 % drop in sectarian violence in 2007 - 2008 , assisting the @entity8 security forces and the @entity51 in securing territory from @entity7 to the @entity16 enclaves of @entity44 and the surrounding @entity44 " belts			1
" as the situation stabilized , the @entity8 government agreed to a plan to integrate vetted @entity16 members of the @entity101 into the @entity8 army and police to make those forces more representative of the overall @entity8 population			2
but this integration never happened			0
@entity24 was comfortable touting his support for the @entity101 in @entity114 areas such as @entity116 and @entity117 provinces , but he refused to absorb @entity16 into the ranks of the security forces along @entity30 - @entity16 fault lines in central @entity8			1
in areas with ( or near ) @entity30 populations , @entity24 saw the @entity51 - backed @entity101 as a threat , and he systematically set out to dismantle the program over the next four years			0
as this process played out , we saw its effects firsthand in our interactions with @entity8 government officials and tribal leaders in @entity44 , where it was clear the @entity101 were under increasing pressure from both the government and @entity38			0
by 2013 , the @entity101 were virtually nonexistent , with thousands of their sidelined former members either neutral or aligned with the @entity9 in its war against the @entity8 government			0
the disappearance of the @entity101 meant that few @entity16 in western and northern @entity8 had a stake in the defense of their own communities			0
the vast system of security forces and @entity16 tribal auxiliaries that had made the @entity16 provinces of @entity8 hostile territory for @entity38 was dismantled			1
the militant gains in @entity7 and other cities of the north and @entity116 are the direct result of the removal of the @entity8 security forces commanders and local sons of @entity8 leaders who had turned the tide against @entity38 in 2007 - 2008			1
those commanders who had a reason to secure and hold territory in the north were replaced with @entity24 loyalists from @entity44 who , when the bullets began to fly , had no interest in dying for @entity16 and @entity54 territory			2
and when the commanders left the battlefield this week , their troops melted away as well			0
what can be done ? the problem will only get worse in the coming months			0
now that the @entity8 government 's weakness in @entity16 territories has been exposed , other @entity16 extremist groups are joining forces with the @entity9 to exploit the opening			2
the @entity174 - affiliated @entity173 and the @entity175 are reportedly taking part in the offensive as well , and they are drawing support from a @entity16 population that believes itself persecuted and disenfranchised by @entity24 's government and threatened by @entity30 militias that are his political allies			2
for six months , @entity30 militants have been allowed or encouraged by the government to conduct sectarian cleansing in mixed areas around @entity44 , particularly in @entity57 between @entity44 and the @entity188 border			0
these events contributed to the motivation of @entity16 who have taken up arms or acquiesced in the @entity9 and @entity193 's offensive			0
even as the @entity9 tide rolls southward down the @entity196 , there is probably little danger of @entity44 and other @entity30 areas falling into @entity16 insurgent hands			0
the @entity30 troops unwilling to fight to hold onto @entity7 will be far more motivated to fight to protect @entity30 territories in central and southern @entity8 and to defend the sectarian fault line			2
this is their home territory , where they have the advantage of local knowledge , and where they have successfully fought the @entity16 insurgency for years			0
in the north , however , @entity24 now has two military options			0
he can reconsolidate his shattered forces along sectarian fault lines to defend @entity30 territories in central @entity8 , ceding @entity16 areas to the insurgency , or he can regroup his security forces at their bases north of @entity44 and mount expeditions to conduct " cordon and search " operations in @entity16 areas lost to the @entity9			1
if @entity24 chooses to regroup and move on @entity16 population centers controlled by the @entity9 , we are likely to see @entity30 troops unfamiliar with @entity16 neighborhoods employing heavy - handed tactics , bluntly targeting @entity16 military - age males ( 12 - 60 ) not affiliated with the insurgency and further inflaming sectarian tensions as they do so -- reminiscent of the situation in many parts of @entity8 in 2005 - 2006			1
the problem at its core is not just a matter of security , but politics			0
the @entity9 and its allies would not have had the opportunity to seize ground in the @entity16 @entity238 - dominated provinces of @entity239 , @entity117 and @entity116 if there had been more inclusive and sincere political outreach to the mainstream @entity16 @entity238 community			0
in the end , the solution to the @entity9 threat is a fundamental change in @entity8 's political discourse , which has become dominated by one sect and one man , and the inclusion of mainstream @entity16 and @entity81 as full partners in the state			1
if @entity24 truly wishes to restore government control to the @entity16 provinces , he must reach out to @entity16 and @entity54 leaders and ask for their help , and he must re-enlist former sons of @entity8 leaders , purged military commanders and @entity261 to help regain the territory they once helped the @entity8 government defend			2
but these are steps @entity265 has shown himself unwilling and unlikely to take			0
at this point , @entity24 does not have what it takes to address @entity8 's problem -- because he is the problem .			2

**writers** : troop collapse in @entity7 predictable since @entity8 's politicization of security forces
prime minister marginalized @entity16 , @entity81 , replaced them with @entity30 loyalists , they say
**writers** : he 's dismantled @entity16 " awakening " forces that helped rout @entity38 in @entity8
@entity24 should seek security forces he 's *shunned* , but he 's unlikely to , they say
