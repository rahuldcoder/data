-- with their soulful voices and traditional @entity6 dance moves , @entity3 acappella singing sensation @entity1 have been blending vocal harmonies to take audiences on a musical journey for nearly half a century			1
the legendary male choral group has sold millions of albums worldwide , collaborated with music icons such as @entity13 and counts @entity14 as one of their faithful fans -- the venerable @entity18 winner has described the group as " @entity3 's cultural ambassadors			1
