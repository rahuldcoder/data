@entity0 , @entity1 -- if you like spy thrillers , @entity5 and the daily crossword puzzle , you might want to try this : help the @entity8 crack a secret code			1
it could solve a suspected murder			1
@entity13 's decomposing body was found in a field near @entity15 , @entity16 , in 1999			1
it was n't clear how the 41 - year old unemployed @entity18 had died , but law enforcement believed he was murdered			1
their best clue : two pages of encrypted notes written by @entity18 and found in his pocket			1
they might tell investigators where @entity18 had been , what he had been doing and who might have wanted him dead			1
but they could n't break the code			1
in 2001 , local law enforcement turned to the @entity34 and @entity35 for help			2
its analysts , statisticians and mathematicians have puzzled over the two pages of numbers and letters intermittently for 10 years trying to figure out what they mean , but they have n't found the key			1
" we 're beat , " says the head of the unit , @entity45			1
on march 29 , the @entity8 asked the public for ideas			1
in just a week and half more than 2,300 tips have flooded in			2
they are still being processed , but so far none of the theories or leads has solved the mystery			2
go to @entity8 site , see if you can help crack code could the notes be gibberish ? @entity60 says they definitely are not			1
we have very consistent character repeating sequences			2
there are almost rules to whatever language this is			2
this is not just letters put down			2
" @entity18 had dabbled with ciphers since he was a child and although he was n't well educated , @entity60 says , his code is unlike anything he has ever seen -- unique and idiosyncratic			2
he hopes a member of the public might connect it with a hobby , a game or a line of work			2
the @entity8 unit often cracks codes in just a couple of hours			1
it has deciphered secret communications about murder , drug transactions , illegal gambling and human trafficking			0
one of the toughest cases involved a note composed by @entity95 , a former @entity96 master sergeant convicted of attempted espionage in 2003			0
the note identified seven locations in a @entity101 's @entity100 where @entity95 allegedly dropped documents stolen from the @entity103			0
the office builds and operates satellites for government agencies like the @entity107			0
while in prison , @entity95 worked with the @entity8 to decipher the complex code , which he had created but , ironically , had forgotten			1
eventually , they were able to associate a sequence of code with the letter " @entity114 " the key that unlocked it was the name @entity117 , handwritten under a gag photograph of a masked classmate in @entity95 's middle school yearbook			0
@entity60 says computers are n't much use in his line of work			0
" these are codes that are made by humans and they 're best broken by humans , " he says			1
a simple whiteboard , however , is an important tool			0
@entity60 and his team use one to dissect a segment of code , looking for patterns and logic in what appears to be a jumble of symbols			0
it is collaborative work where creative ideas and unusual insights are encouraged and exchanged			0
@entity60 says a good crpytanalyst needs tenacity and high self - esteem			0
he or she can not be easily discouraged , @entity60 says , but sometimes needs to recognize that there is a time to step away			0
do they ever quit working on a code altogether ? it does n't look that way			0
in the @entity8 office is a board holding copies of the @entity8 's " @entity160 " uncracked coded communications			1
over the years , some have been solved and removed			0
right now , in the top slot , is a note from the " @entity164 , " who murdered five people in @entity168 's @entity167 in 1968 and 1969			0
the notes found in @entity13 's pocket are posted in position no. 3			1
@entity60 is hopeful that sometime soon , with the public 's help , they too will come down from the board and questions about @entity18 's death will finally be answered			0
@entity178 is @entity2 homeland security correspondent and @entity179 is a senior producer .			0
