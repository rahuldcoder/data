the failed referendum in @entity1 , @entity2 , to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy is the first known instance of the issue being addressed at a local level , but it might not be the last			1
" i think we 'll see this more and more , " said @entity11 , communications director for @entity12 , an anti-abortion group			2
" we 're constantly doing things on the local level in terms of outreach because those methods are very effective in bringing about social change in general , " said @entity13 , who with her husband , @entity15 , is with the group @entity16			1
@entity1 voters reject late - term abortion ban the @entity25 call themselves " full - time pro-life missionaries			1
" they moved to @entity1 three years ago , after waging an anti-abortion battle in @entity28 , because @entity1 has one of the few abortion clinics in the country to perform abortions beyond 20 weeks			1
@entity13 said the state legislature has repeatedly refused to take up a parental notification measure , one of the most basic steps for abortion opponents			1
the legislature " never gives our bill the time of day , " she told @entity36			0
after watching a successful local campaign to place a minimum wage increase on the @entity1 ballot in 2012 , @entity13 became inspired			1
she thought something similar could be done with abortion			1
after collecting 27,000 signatures of support , the measure got its own special election			0
while this is the first time a city has voted on whether to restrict abortions , the idea is not new			1
social movements often start at the grass - roots level as cities and localities often shift more quickly than the federal government			1
that 's where the movement to legalize marijuana got its start			2
" reformers have always used local referenda and initiative , " @entity64 , executive director of the @entity65 for the @entity66 , said			1
built on principles from the @entity73 protests , activists seized on a nixon - era report that criticized the criminalization of marijuana			2
the report went nowhere at the federal level as @entity80 was adamantly opposed to its findings , but activists used the report to organize in cities and towns in all 50 states , @entity77 said			1
university towns , especially in the @entity88 , including @entity89 , @entity90 , and @entity91 , @entity92 , acted to decriminalize pot. it became a trend and is still happening today			0
in this past election , three cities in @entity90 voted to legalize pot. although the vote was largely symbolic , it shows that local can still lead the way			2
smoke clears for attitudes on pot , voters respond it 's an effort " to get around recalcitrant legislators who do n't want to even introduce bills , " @entity77 said			2
another @entity88 town played a central role in the lesbian and gay movement as well			0
@entity111 , @entity90 , was the first place in the country to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation			0
that was in the early ' 70s			0
forty years later , @entity117 has still been unable to pass an @entity119 workplace anti-discrimination bill			0
@entity120 , state legislative director for the @entity121 , said her group " works with municipalities all the time " to pass and implement lgbt rights measures			0
pro-choice advocates , however , caution the anti-abortion activists from overstepping and trying to chip away at settled law			0
" what we 're actually seeing because of the groundswell of anti-abortion overreach , we 're seeing the entire movement put into an offensive posture , " said @entity128 , president of @entity129			0
she added that @entity135 is settled law and any attempt to roll back abortion access will get caught up in litigation			2
but the tactic also appeals to anti-abortion activists who hope the courts roll back @entity135			0
" we are more than happy , " @entity13 said , " to assist ... and encourage people in the cities who have problems with state legislatures			0
" and an activist has already begun the process to ban late - term abortions in @entity151 , a county neighboring @entity1 .			1

voters in @entity1 rejected a ballot initiative to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy
it is the first known instance the issue of abortion has been addressed at such a local level .
social movements often start at the grass - roots level , rather than the less - *pliable* federal level
