if it has n't happened already , it probably will at some point : the moment you do n't like one of your child 's friends			1
what do you do ? i remember when i was growing up and my mom did n't love me spending time with one of the girls in our neighborhood			0
she did n't forbid me from being with her but did n't encourage our get - togethers , either			0
eventually , i realized this friend was n't the right fit for me for a host of reasons , and the relationship fizzled			2
years later , i wondered : how did my mom know ? clinical psychologist @entity22 , co-director of the early childhood clinical service at the @entity26 's @entity25 , says the first thing parents need to ask themselves is why they do n't like one of their children 's friends			1
" is it because they do n't like that person 's mom ? is it because that kid gets really good grades and it 's easy for them and that person is a little narcissistic ? or is it something that is really serious that you 're worried your child would model an unhealthy behavior ? " asked @entity42 , who is also a clinical assistant professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the @entity45			1
" so i think parents need to understand why they have these feelings and where they 're coming from			0
" sometimes , it 's not so easy to figure out			0
' brutally honest ' : mean girls are getting younger when @entity58 ' now - 15 - year - old son was in elementary school , he became friends with a boy who shared his interests in video games and sports			2
however , the friend was " a lot ' older ' for his age , used a lot of profanity and had quite a reputation for saying hurtful things to peers , " said @entity58 , the photographer and writer behind the lifestyle blog @entity75			0
it was hard to be neutral , she said			0
she did n't want to judge too much and demand an end to the friendship , because that might have caused her son to lie about contact with his friend			1
instead , @entity58 invited her son 's friend to her home more to get to know him better and had several conversations with his parents , which helped a lot and made her see there was more to this friend than she initially realized			1
" turns out , this friend has actually grown into a very nice teenager , and they are still friends , " said @entity58 , who is also a freelance writer in @entity91 , @entity92 , and an account executive for @entity94 , where she connects bloggers with brands			2
" it 's so hard to gauge these things , " she said , because kids change so much over time			0
when you ca n't stand your kids ' friend @entity106 , a mom of two grown daughters , took a similar approach any time she did n't care for one of her girls ' friends			1
" i would figure out why and then befriend them , " said @entity106 , of @entity112 , @entity113			0
" the minute you get these kids to respect you , the less likely they are to disrespect you and the more likely they are to show you reasons why they are unlikeable			0
" @entity42 , the psychologist , said that if a parent has a " feeling " every time their child spends time with another child they do n't like , they should probably do something about the relationship			1
" if it 's something a parent is highly distressed about and they just believe and know that in their heart that this is not right ... then i think it 's absolutely appropriate for parents to set limits on hanging out with kids who are ' bad influences ' on their kids			2
" the warning signs of a damaging and dangerous friendship could include gossiping and bullying , use of alcohol and drugs , poor grades , cutting school and self - harm , she added			2
chances are , your teen has sexted forbidding a friendship could backfire , but talking to your child during a calm moment , not in the middle of a power struggle , can help the child open up about the friendship and what he or she gets from that connection , experts say			1
parenting advocate @entity162 , author of the book " @entity164 : advice and @entity174 , " encourages parents to ask questions such as " what do they have in common with their friend and what do they like to do together ? " " i always tell parents it is best to have the conversations before confrontations take place , " said @entity162			1
" staying calm , showing a genuine interest in their friends , even if you do n't care for them , will show your child you are respecting him ( or ) her			2
" she added , " gradually , you have to point out that friends do n't bring other friends down , especially if your child is slipping in their grades , getting in trouble , etc. " awkward ! the tough transition to middle school as parents , we know the stakes can be high when our child befriends someone whom we believe could be a danger			1
recent surveys quantify how damaging those friendships can be			0
teens with friends who do drugs and drink alcohol are more likely to do the same , according to a 2011 survey sponsored by the @entity207 and the @entity208			1
a survey by @entity210 found that only 10 % of teens said they had not been influenced by peer pressure and 46 % of teens said they teased somebody because their friends were teasing that person			0
@entity162 , who works with parents of teens who are engaging in high risk behaviors , said there is another side to this issue : sometimes your own child is the problem , and that is not so easy to accept			2
" if your child is hanging with a less than desirable crowd , your child might be part of things you do n't want to face either but need to , " said @entity162			0
" it is so frustrating when parents say , ' not my child			0
' " what would you do if you did n't like one of your child 's friends ? share your thoughts in the comments or tell @entity240 on @entity241 or @entity242 on @entity243 .			1
