-- entertainer @entity1 scores a 93 , edging out president @entity2 at 91			0
@entity4 rising star @entity3 scores an 80			0
@entity6 chairman @entity5 gets a 77			0
pope @entity7 earns a 53			0
however , these very public figures -- along with the other hundreds of millions of us using social media -- all bow to the 100 - point chart - topper : teen heartthrob @entity13			0
we 're talking about @entity15 , the four - year - old web service that measures online influence based on " one 's ability to drive action			1
" klout scores are derived from social networks -- mostly @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 -- to measure how many people you influence , how much you influence them and the relative power of your network			2
some have described a @entity15 score as the credit score of the digital age			1
it has very little to do with real - world , offline influence and everything to do with @entity25 retweets and @entity24 likes			2
the more of those you have , the higher your score			2
the @entity44 - based startup claims to have assigned scores to more than 100 million people			2
@entity0 sat down recently with @entity15 co-founder and ceo @entity48 to discuss why web users should know their @entity15 score , how brands are capitalizing on rewarding key influencers , the company 's first acquisition and why burritos helped shape the initial idea behind @entity15			1
@entity0 : why should people care about their @entity15 score ? @entity48 : we 're helping people better measure and understand influence online			1
to examine the content users create on @entity25 , @entity24 , @entity63 , the whole social web			1
as the @entity64 grows more massive all the time , it 's becoming increasingly important to quickly assess what internet users are influential about and how they are influenced in order to make more informed decisions			1
what are the most effective means for increasing one 's @entity15 score ? consistency is really the biggest thing			1
it 's finding time in your day to create at least one piece of content to keep your network engaged in what you have to share			2
last year @entity15 users reacted rather loudly to some pretty significant changes to the service			1
how has the feedback been overall now that a number of months have passed and what did you guys learn in terms of the passion of your core users ? it was a great learning experience for us			2
people were surprised at how much their scores shifted and their passion for the scores definitely showed after that			0
what we learned was that we need to drive transparency and make it clear why users ' scores changed			1
since then we 've worked to add layers of transparency and our users have reacted very well			1
is it true the idea for @entity15 was partly inspired by your expertise in burritos ? @entity113 ... yes			1
my jaw was wired shut for three months in 2007			0
i was thinking all the time about food			0
i then became interested in the idea that , because i recommend taquerias to friends online so much , that i should be rewarded for that expertise			2
burritos were definitely a part of my inspiration			0
are you seeing adoption of the @entity15 service in the job market ? everywhere i go it seems i 'm meeting someone who tells me they either put their @entity15 score on their resume and got the job or it came up during the job interview			1
if you think about what 's important in the workplace today , for many positions , it 's one 's ability to activate a network			1
to be comfortable in the social web			2
@entity15 is a great way to benchmark how effective someone really is			1
it seems businesses are beginning to pay more attention to key influencers online and reward those patrons accordingly			0
what is a good example of an industry or company using @entity15 to elevate the consumer experience ? one of my favorite uses are by hotel properties that are now using @entity15 scores to upgrade the rooms of guests during check - in as they access their online influence rating			1
these types of perks have been offered for many years but always based on how much money a person spends			0
now for the first time brands are valuing your networks			0
@entity15 was in the news very recently with the acquisition of @entity175 , a service that helps people connect with their neighbors			1
what can you share about the thinking behind the move and what impact will it have on users ? the web is clearly shifting from desktop to mobile			2
we 've done a good job at understanding influence online , but as it drives down to local and mobile we thought it was important to pick up a team like the people at @entity175 that are as passionate as we are about the rest of social media and open up mobile to @entity15 in new ways			1
how do you respond to criticism that the @entity15 score is not a true reflection of influence ? for example , ahead of the @entity205 caucus , @entity202 and @entity203 were tied according to their @entity15 score ( 78 )			1
but ultimately @entity208 won in @entity205			0
what 's wrong ? @entity15 measures your ability to drive actions online			1
that does n't always reflect in the real world			0
we predicted the @entity215 would win the @entity216 because many of their players had higher @entity15 scores			2
but on the playing field it 's a different situation			0
just like @entity222 and @entity202 were tied online but the voters in @entity205 saw things differently			2
with @entity231 heritage as part of your background , what has it been like as one of just a handful of latino tech company entrepreneurs ? this entire journey so far has been great			0
the @entity237 community online along with the rise of social media use across @entity240 has been supportive throughout , offering lots of goodwill			0
@entity243 is an interesting place			0
i went there two years ago not knowing a single person			0
i believe anyone can arrive and if you have a great idea and the passion to build a company , you 're gon na get a shot at it			0
what do you see for the short - and long - term future of the company ? our big thing is continue to drive value for our users			1
help them understand their influence			0
and not enough for them to just understand their reach but benefit from it			0
big things are in store for @entity15 users in 2012 , such as the integration on the mobile platform ... [ and ] new tools that increase transparency and help people drive up their scores .			1

@entity15 is a web service that examines online influence based on " one 's ability to drive action "
the most effective means for increasing one 's @entity15 score is consistency
big things are in store for users this year such as new tools that increase transparency
