@entity1 officials are scratching their heads over the decision by @entity4 to sue president @entity5 over his decision to delay a requirement in the health care law for businesses to provide coverage to employees			1
that 's because , as one senior administration official pointed out on friday , those same lawmakers voted to do the exact same thing at virtually the exact same time -- defer until 2015 the part of @entity17 known as the employer mandate			1
house speaker @entity19 justified last july 's vote , held days after the @entity5 administration action , as a repudiation of the executive decision to alter a major part of the politically - charged law just months before it was put into practice			1
" i get to look at the @entity27 once in a while			0
the @entity27 makes it clear that @entity29 writes the law , and the president takes the oath of office to faithfully discharge the laws that are on the books , " @entity19 said			2
the @entity1 voted separately to delay the @entity17 individual mandate as well , another centerpiece of the landmark 2010 law that remains in place and requires everyday @entity41 to have some kind of health insurance			1
both the business and individual mandates required compliance to avoid possible fines			0
the two @entity1 votes drew significant @entity50 support but the @entity50 - led @entity51 did n't take up either			2
obamacare fight continues the reference to last year 's vote by the @entity4 - led @entity1 signals @entity1 confidence that @entity19 's lawsuit announced on thursday night will fail in court			1
@entity1 @entity4 tried to use their constitutional powers to delay the mandate but failed , the @entity1 thinking goes			1
@entity19 consulted legal experts before announcing the action and @entity64 's @entity63 and @entity65 reported that they were advised that keeping the focus of any legal challenge narrow offered the best chance to succeed in court			1
the suit first must be authorized by legislation before being submitted in federal court by private attorneys			0
the timing of a court filing is unclear			0
@entity17 is the signature domestic policy achievement of @entity5 's presidency so far			2
it 's aimed at fulfilling his promise to make health care coverage available to millions without it			0
since october , the administration says 9 million people have signed up for a range of policies through federal and state insurance markets			0
but it has also been a bitter partisan flashpoint since its approval in 2010 without @entity4 support			2
@entity4 have made it a focus of their sharp political attacks on @entity5 and @entity50 ahead of november 's midterms with control of the @entity51 at stake			1
" in terms of politics , there is no issue that @entity4 have the best chance of riling up the base than @entity17 , " @entity63 said			2
the case also magnifies a toxic partisan climate that has engulfed @entity29 overall and come to define @entity5 's relations with @entity4 in general			1
some arch - conservatives in the party want him impeached			0
pushing forward @entity19 does n't agree with such a step , but he 's plowing ahead with an unusual legal challenge built around @entity4 claims @entity5 has abused his authority at the expense of the legislative process			1
@entity5 defiantly challenged @entity4 last week , saying he would continue to take steps he felt were necessary with or without the support of congressional @entity4			2
" so sue me , " he dared them			0
@entity1 spokesman @entity115 quickly dismissed @entity19 's decision to take his case court as a " political stunt			1
" the president " is doing his job -- lawsuit or not -- and it 's time @entity4 in @entity29 did theirs , " @entity115 said in a statement			2
@entity19 argued the employer mandate delay is the best legal avenue for his case against @entity4 claims that @entity5 has overstepped his executive authority in carrying out his priorities			1
" in 2013 , the president changed the health care law without a vote of @entity29 , effectively creating his own law by literally waiving the employer mandate and the penalties for failing to comply with it , " @entity19 said in a statement thursday			1
" that 's not the way our system of government was designed to work			0
no president should have the power to make laws on his or her own , " @entity19 said			2
@entity1 @entity4 point to the support they received from constitutional scholars who testified on the @entity17 mandate delay last december			1
@entity5 overreach ? at a @entity156 hearing , @entity152 law professor @entity151 , a once fierce critic of the @entity154 administration , suggested @entity5 overreached			0
" the president is required to faithfully execute the laws			0
he 's not required to enforce all laws equally or commit the same resources to them , " he said			0
" but i believe the president has crossed the constitutional line			0
" administration officials have repeatedly argued that alterations to the @entity17 are legal			0
in february 2013 , a @entity167 spokeswoman told @entity168 the administration has the power to delay the employer mandate and its fines , which are in essence taxes on businesses that do not comply with the law			1
the taxing authority of the federal government was the legal underpinning of the @entity180 's decision to uphold the sweeping health law and its individual mandate in 2012			0
but other legal experts have already said any lawsuit around executive authority would face challenges			0
in order for it to be formally considered by the courts , @entity187 must prove that the chamber was somehow injured as an institution			0
read the resolution ( @entity193 ) @entity19 op - ed : why we must now sue the president opinion : dear speaker @entity19 : do your job instead			1

the @entity1 is puzzled by the focus of a @entity4 lawsuit against president @entity5
the challenge centers on the @entity17 employer mandate delay
@entity5 acted on his own last *summer* , but @entity1 @entity4 also voted to defer it for a year
so do they have a case ? house speaker @entity19 says they do , despite the @entity1 vote
