-- through sports , @entity1 was able to overcome his addiction to drugs and alcohol			1
he worked out in a boxing gym , got involved with triathlons and climbing , and made new friends who supported him through his transition			1
encouraged by his success , @entity1 wanted to help others deal with their own addiction			1
so in 2007 , he started a nonprofit , @entity14			1
@entity14 has provided free athletic activities and a sober support community to more than 6,000 participants in @entity18			1
it offers dozens of programs every week , from casual walks and yoga to mountain biking and ice climbing			2
@entity0 asked @entity1 for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 @entity26 of 2012			1
@entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean for @entity14 ? @entity1 : my hope is that sharing this story on the national stage will help @entity14 reach the angel donors that we need to support our current work and help us expand nationally			1
more than 23 million people over the age of 12 in the @entity39 are struggling with addiction and need treatment			1
of those , only about 10 % get treatment			1
when i got sober , i was alone and did n't know what to do			2
i knew i could n't go back to using or i was going to die			0
finding others living a sober , healthy lifestyle and finding hope and happiness in sobriety were gifts that saved my life			2
i knew i had to give this gift to others			0
there are millions out there in the dark days of their addiction , alone , trying to figure out how to stay alive			0
i hope that sharing my story and the story of @entity14 does two things			0
first , i want those who are addicted and those who love them to know they are not alone and that there is hope			0
second , everyone knows someone who has struggled with addiction			0
it may be your mother , cousin , friend , co-worker , admired athlete , movie star or musician , but we are all well aware of how bad things can get when addiction takes over			0
it is my hope that by sharing this story on the national stage , people will realize recovery is possible			2
who should be the @entity26 ? cast your vote now ! @entity14 is only in existence because of the support we receive from donors			1
it is my ultimate hope that this amazing opportunity allows us to reach donors who can help us create a sober active community in cities and towns across the nation			2
by supporting @entity14 financially , donors can make recovery possible for millions nationally and we can break the cycle of addiction so future generations do n't have to grow up under the shadow of alcoholism or drug addiction			0
@entity0 : what was the reaction when you found out you were a top 10 @entity26 ? @entity1 : i was deeply moved			1
( our ) staff and supporters have been working so hard for several years to help build the @entity14 sober active community			2
telling the successes of this story i believe will help rally other supporters around us , allowing @entity14 to reach thousands more with our programs			0
( we ) and our supporters were overjoyed by the acknowledgement of our work			0
so rarely is the recovery side of addiction discussed in the media , so @entity14 felt honored to share the telling of this story of recovery and hope with @entity0 and its audience			0
@entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award you receive for being selected as a top 10 @entity26 ? @entity1 : @entity14 has always had the goal of having chapters in cities across the country			1
and with this recognition from @entity0 , we believe this dream will come true , allowing @entity14 's programs to reach others battling the darkness of addiction			0
we believe that recovery heals individuals and families			0
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity1 : @entity14 prides itself on our ability to help recovering addicts and alcoholics repair their self - esteem			1
many of us in recovery had our dreams stripped away during our alcohol and drug use			0
the @entity14 community helps give those dreams back through standing on top of mountains and crossing finish lines			2
we also help those in recovery let go of some of the shame associated with their addiction by wearing a @entity14 t - shirt or bike jersey			0
it makes a statement that " i 'm a better person today because i 'm sober , and if you are out there struggling with addiction , we are here for you			2
