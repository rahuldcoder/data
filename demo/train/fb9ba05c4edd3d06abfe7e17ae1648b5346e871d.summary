@entity0 -- the man whose investigation of president @entity4 provided reams of tabloid fodder is now working to help crack down on photographers working for the very publications his efforts once filled			1
photographers surround singer @entity12 ' car in @entity0 , @entity14 , in october			1
@entity15 -- the independent counsel whose open - ended investigation of a @entity4 land deal veered into an intimately detailed report on the president 's affair with intern @entity21 -- is helping @entity14 lawmakers craft laws to crack down on celebrity - hunting packs of paparazzi			1
@entity27 mayor @entity26 contacted @entity15 , now a law school dean at @entity29 in @entity27			1
local governments in @entity0 and @entity31 are also part of the effort to curb what they call a dangerous and expensive problem			1
" just imagine you 're a motorist driving down the street and @entity12 parks next to you ; all of a sudden you 're swarmed by these people , " @entity0 city councilman @entity37 said			2
" they 've got cameras ; they 're jumping on the hood of my car			0
" you do n't know if you 're getting carjacked			0

" the idea of a " safe zone " around celebrities has been kicked around by @entity0 - area lawmakers for years			2
the push became more intense in the wake of multiple mob scenes around pop star @entity12 last year , including a virtual siege of her @entity57 , @entity14 , home and similar scenes during her trips to hospitals			2
@entity15 has been in contact with the officials but is " not ready to publicly comment " on any plan he may have , according to a @entity29 spokesperson			0

but @entity37 and others argue that police resources are stretched thin by the current state of things , citing $ 25,000 shelled out last year for a police escort for @entity79			1
to some , @entity15 -- the man vilified by liberals for a lengthy and costly @entity4 investigation that turned up @entity4 's personal foibles but no major wrongdoing in the @entity85 land deals -- seems an odd partner for politicians in the notoriously left - leaning @entity0 area			1
" the irony is that he was so criticized , so vilified by @entity31 liberals 10 years ago during the @entity21 impeachment saga , " said @entity89 , a senior editor at @entity90			0
" now he 's kind of aligned himself with a lot of @entity27 residents who probably disagree with him politically			1
" but @entity37 , who has been a prime backer of laws curbing the " @entity99 , " said @entity15 's expertise will be valuable as lawmakers try to strike a balance between public safety and @entity105 concerns			2
" i have a lot of respect for @entity15 , " @entity37 said			0
" we do n't want to violate any rules			0
we do n't want to violate the @entity110			0
