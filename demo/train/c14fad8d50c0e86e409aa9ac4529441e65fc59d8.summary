-- if someone in your house is mad for @entity4 , get ready to lay out some serious cash			0
the boy band tops the list of most expensive concert tickets with the average ticket costing $ 674.23			1
that 's a lot of hours of babysitting for your average teen girl to be able to buy her own ticket			0
according to @entity15 , founder and chief executive officer of the ticket search engine , @entity18 , there are a few reasons for the super-sized prices			0
acts such as the @entity22 price their tickets high in the primary market ( companies such as @entity30 , @entity31 and your venue 's box office ) so that the secondary ticket market ( those brokers / companies that resell those tickets ) ca n't make as much money off of their show			1
so while an upper level ticket for @entity4 may have originally been as inexpensive as $ 29.50 from a primary seller , those prices rise much higher when they are scarce and being sold in a secondary market			0
@entity15 said the @entity22 strategy of pricing their primary tickets high can backfire as the group recently discovered when they found themselves unable to sell some tickets			1
but it 's the secondary markets that help to keep the ticket prices high in the rafters , @entity15 said			0
" they get sold in the primary market for , say a round number of 100 bucks , a broker buys those and says ' i 'm going to mark these tickets up to $ 300 because i think that 's what the market demands , ' " he said			1
there also is the matter of the scarcity of tickets			1
many fans have experienced the utter frustration of waiting for tickets to go on sale at 11 a.m. only to have a site register that there are no more tickets available just minutes later			1
but what about those phrases you have to type in that ensure that you are a human and not a bot attempting to buy blocks of tickets ? it matters not , @entity15 said			2
" one of the worst examples of that was a @entity81 concert in @entity82 , " he said			2
" only 8 % of the tickets went on sale to the general public			2
the rest were getting sold through his fan club , through [ credit ] cardholder [ special promotions , ] and artist hold - backs			0
literally , that on sale to the public is a really small percentage of tickets			2
" @entity99 @entity98 rep. @entity97 has drafted legislation that would require more transparency			0
" what i want is that people will know ahead of time how many tickets are going to go on sale for the general public , " @entity97 told today			2
if you are lucky enough to score one , it 's going to cost you			0
the @entity111 are the hottest tickets this summer with the @entity22 clocking in just behind their countrymen , @entity4 , with the average ticket price being $ 637.50			1
@entity115 came in third place , commanding an average $ 358.97			0
such prices are the reason @entity119 magazine recently reported that " the days of seeing the world 's biggest rock and pop bands for a few bucks , plus a little extra for parking and service fees , are as long gone as @entity127 's curly hair			0
" @entity15 said fans are willing to pay for a chance to see ( maybe ) the @entity22 last concert or @entity132 's moves in person			1
" there is a lot of interest in the live concert experience , especially with the @entity138 and tv even , concerts are kind of the last thing that you ca n't experience the same way in your living room or on your computer , " he said .			1
