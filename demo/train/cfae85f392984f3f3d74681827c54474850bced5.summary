@entity0 -- the spotlight on so - called " honor " murders in @entity4 and across the world in recent days has raised awareness about the deaths of countless innocent victims , but condemning the act and its perpetrators does little to end the murders or address the root causes of the problem			1
i started my career as a gender specialist working in many countries where " honor " murders and other acts of violence against women often found considerable public support			2
as a naÃ ¯ ve and newbie rebellious activist , i never asked " why ? " instead i set out on my activism by loudly condemning the culture of violence against women in these regions as if it were an isolated phenomenon from other longstanding gender - racial - religious injustices i witnessed			2
@entity34 court convicts parents of murder in " honor " murder expressing my horror and repulsion of " honor " murders with like - minded colleagues made me feel righteous and involved			2
but the more i focused my outrage on the perpetrators , the more i sensed a growing divide between " them down below " and " us up above			0
" @entity49 issued death sentence after i asked for divorce of course , i was part of the " us " -- the humane , the educated , the egalitarian			0
today , i am an aid worker in @entity0 , @entity54			1
it 's a job that has exposed me to the dehumanizing effects of war , poverty , economic disasters , and natural calamities			0
i have seen dehumanizing living conditions breed dehumanized people			1
the outcome is a nation where tens of millions of people live without their most basic needs being met			0
every day i see @entity54 robbed of their dignity , their hope , and ultimately their sense of significance			1
i believe every human being instinctively yearns for a sense of significance -- a reason why their absence or presence matters			0
in a culture where systematic dehumanization through corruption - fueled poverty makes a sense of self virtually impossible , i have found that it 's useless to merely condemn those seeking it by being an " honor " killer or a " protector of the @entity88 " or even a " suicide bomber			0
" instead , i blame the wealthy , powerful and educated elite for failing to humanize the masses			1
not with charity and altruism -- which are acts that still preserve the " us up here " and " them down there " divide -- but by demanding true political , economic and institutional change			0
i am well aware of the stakes at hand			0
a large section of @entity54 's powerful elite is made up of landlords exploiting a deeply rooted feudal system			1
today , the feudal elite is entrenched in @entity54 's political system			1
for the feudal elite to eradicate poverty and ignorance , they must conjure the political will to create equality by pushing for land reform			1
they must pay for education and social welfare programs by enacting new tax laws			0
and they must demand transparency in government to end corruption			0
these drastic policy shifts are likely counterintuitive to the power elite 's longstanding views on governance , but a solution to " honor " murders and the many injustices and inequalities in @entity54 society starts here			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			2
