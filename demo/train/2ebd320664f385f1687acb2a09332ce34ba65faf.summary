-- @entity2 ceo @entity1 had to apologize for the buggy new @entity5 app in the @entity6 and @entity7 on friday , saying that his company " fell short " of making a " world - class product			1
" it was a gracious and humble admission of a major mistake -- a sign that @entity2 takes its customers seriously and conducts itself with integrity			2
" we are extremely sorry for the frustration this has caused , " @entity1 said in a letter posted on the company 's website			1
" we are doing everything we can to make @entity5 better			0
" that relentless focus on treating customers right is why @entity2 has been the undisputed leader of the technology business for the past decade			2
but while the apology is commendable , the maps mistake was entirely @entity2 's fault			2
previous versions of the @entity6 and @entity7 used @entity5 , which are the industry standard			1
no one was complaining about @entity5			0
sure , they 're not perfect , but we 're all used to their errors and gaps			0
but @entity2 broke its contract to use @entity5 a year earlier than expected because of corporate politics			1
@entity5 is a competitor , and @entity2 wanted to break ties and control its own maps			2
that 's an extra year in which @entity2 could have improved its own maps â € ” an extra year which was apparently sorely needed			0
opinion : maps app is not the only @entity2 misstep the timing of the move surprised even @entity5 , which is scrambling to build its own maps app for the @entity6 and @entity50			1
it reportedly wo n't be ready until the end of the year			0
until then , @entity2 is stuck telling unhappy customers that they can visit @entity5 in the @entity6 's web browser or download other map apps like @entity55 or @entity56			1
needless to say , it 's more than a little strange for @entity2 to suggest customers to try a @entity61 product			1
to be fair , @entity2 's new maps add important features @entity5 was n't willing to share			1
the @entity6 has built - in , turn - by - turn directions , and the maps are faster and prettier			0
but for most people , the drawbacks far outweigh the benefits			0
what good is voice navigation if it gets you lost ? who cares if the @entity73 map is prettier when it thinks the @entity74 has been demolished and the @entity75 destroyed ? these are n't questions anyone is used to asking about @entity2 products , because @entity2 does n't usually ship broken products			2
@entity2 's failures are magnified by the company 's track record of perfectionism â € ” perfectionism that comes from putting customers first			1
@entity2 ceo : " we are extremely sorry " for @entity5 frustration it 's understandable why @entity2 felt it needed to switch away from @entity5			1
being dependent on a competitor is n't great for any company			0
@entity2 likes to control its own destiny			0
@entity1 has said the company needs to " own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make			2
" maps are without question a critical feature for smartphones and tablets , and it makes sense for @entity2 to build its own			0
but it does n't make sense to switch away from @entity5 before @entity2 's own product is ready , and it 's doubtful iphone 5 sales would have been even slightly affected because the @entity5 app on @entity110 is slightly better			1
now it 's fair to wonder if potential upgraders and switchers are n't holding back because they do n't want to be forced into using inferior maps			0
@entity5 : no plans ' yet ' for @entity7 mapping app @entity2 deserves praise for being forthright and direct in its apology , but no company wants to be praised for its apologies			1
it 's more important for @entity2 to understand its mistake and try to prevent it from happening again			0
@entity2 is the most valuable company in the world because it has always fought battles for the consumer , not for the company			0
but in its race to win a corporate victory over @entity5 , @entity2 seems to have gotten a little bit lost			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity131 .			0

@entity2 ceo @entity1 had to apologize for new @entity5 app on @entity6 and @entity7
@entity131 : in its competition with @entity5 , @entity2 seems to have gotten a bit lost
he says it 's more than a little strange for @entity2 to tell customers to try other products
@entity131 : no company wants to be praised for its apologies ; @entity2 needs to get it right
