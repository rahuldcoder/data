@entity0 , @entity1 -- a laptop with two touch - screens in lieu of a keyboard , tablets running an unfinished version of @entity10 's @entity9 , @entity12 sets that do n't require glasses			1
these are some of the most buzzed - about gadgets at the @entity16 , but many of them are n't fully developed yet or primed for firsthand testing			2
and electronics makers are going to great lengths with smoke and mirrors to hopefully distract audiences from noticing the unknowns -- like how a product actually works when not under carefully controlled conditions			0
@entity2 spotted this trend early with tablets we were n't allowed to touch			2
on @entity35 's popular @entity34 units , only videos of the new @entity9 system are shown , not usable software			1
@entity37 finally let people get their hands on its @entity40 , but some online blogged their disappointments when they discovered that things like standalone calendar and e-mail clients are seemingly missing from these versions			0
getting sneak peeks at unpolished work is part of the fun of @entity16			0
but enthusiasm should be tempered because many of the concept products shown in years past have never materialized			2
perhaps gadget enthusiasts prefer captivating concepts rather than actual products that may not end up being executed perfectly			0
the winner of the @entity60 contest on saturday was the product that seemed to be the furthest from reality			1
@entity64 's @entity63 , a touch - screen laptop with two displays where one replaces a keyboard , won the top honors			1
winners are determined through a largely unscientific measurement of crowd enthusiasm			0
the @entity63 would let users type on a touch - screen keyboard similar to the @entity74 , or draw , flick and zoom with their fingers			1
@entity64 did n't announce details regarding pricing or availability			1
the device was demonstrated onstage using concept videos			0
@entity64 presented a corn - ball act , with pretty girls dressed in " @entity85 " garb and two men posing as the characters @entity88 and @entity87			1
( because all nerds love " @entity85 , " right ? )			0
after a first video ran showing the @entity63 , the two actors said they would demonstrate the device onstage			1
as they moved their hands around the laptop set on the podium , the video behind them showed the @entity88 actor 's fingers manipulating @entity63 software			1
that was until a cameraman for the event began shooting from behind the actors to reveal that they were waving their hands in front of a regular , old laptop with a keyboard			1
" you 've got to show our video , guys ! " the fellow dressed as @entity87 shouted to the event organizers			0
" @entity63 is way ahead of its time , @entity88			1
" an actual version of the computer was on display and open for testing at @entity119 's @entity16 booth			2
typing on it is difficult and somewhat uncomfortable			0
visually , the software looks like a version of @entity124 with touch - screen features , like a button to activate the keyboard , duct taped on top			1
despite that , @entity64 still won the @entity60 competition			2
the audience was unimpressed with @entity134 's @entity133 camera or @entity137 's @entity136 phone , both of which are already available on the market			2
@entity137 brought out a guy dressed as a gingerbread man ( a costume that looked more like a spastic beaver ) to promote the smartphone , which is the only one that comes with the @entity148 version of @entity9			0
then @entity137 spokesman @entity149 made a series of nauseating puns			0
" no biting questions , " he said			0
maybe @entity137 should have invested in some @entity154 costumes instead .			0

@entity64 's @entity63 laptop , with a touch - screen instead of a keyboard , was well received
a working *prototype* of the @entity63 was not ready to be shown
despite that , the audience *cheered* for @entity64 , making the contest winner @entity63
