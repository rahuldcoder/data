until 2010 , the @entity6 - born @entity5 worked as a strategic business consultant for @entity8 , a high - powered job that kept him ricocheting so constantly between @entity10 and @entity11 that he barely had time to unpack his suitcase			1

while part of what retreat guests love about the @entity59 experience is their shrinking waistlines , @entity58 says the restorative power of nature is equally powerful			1
" a week without hearing a car , " he says , " can blow someone 's mind			0
" the combination of activity and beautiful scenery seems to be the magic formula for many of today 's best get - fit retreats			1
