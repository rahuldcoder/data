-- as a veteran of combat in @entity4 , i am often asked about current wars			1
recently i have been asked about soldiers posing with corpses or urinating on corpses in @entity9			1
the " patriotic " media wants us to understand what it is like to be a soldier in war , not to condone the conduct but to ask " who are we to judge ? " they want to know about rules of war : " are there rules about taking pictures with dead bodies ? " when i see these pictures , i am not shocked			1
i have similar pictures from @entity4			1
and i 'm in them			2
such pictures are part of our warrior culture			2
not everyone takes them , but they are not in any way unusual			2
look at the famous photos from @entity37 in @entity38			2
the @entity40 soldiers are n't looking over their shoulders			1
none of them appears worried about being caught doing something wrong			2
they all look comfortable , often smiling for the camera			2
this tells me that the behavior captured in the photographs was @entity51 ( standard operating procedure )			2
what i find most disconcerting is all this attention to what is done to these dead bodies and absolutely no question or curiosity about why they are dead in the first place			2
no questions about why @entity40 troops are still in @entity9 at all			2
the idea of having " rules of war " assumes that there is a proper and civilized way to conduct warfare			1
i find the idea ludicrous			2
we teach our children to solve their problems without fighting , not by fighting according to rules			1
for the most part we practice what we preach			2
the county i live in sued a city that wanted to build a cement plant			2
the county did n't want the pollution			2
a court ruled in favor of the city , and the county lived by the ruling			2
the county did n't send the sheriff 's department in to kill some city residents			2
@entity90 is suing @entity91 for diverting too much water to @entity93			2
neither state is likely to call out the @entity95 if it loses the case			2
so why is it that when nations have disputes , we must accept that they will murder and maim each other 's citizens ? the conduct of soldiers in war is made up of violent behavior that is criminal behavior outside of war			1
war is when we allow our loved ones to murder and destroy and then wonder that they are so traumatized			1
misconduct hurts morale , @entity110 warns troops in @entity4 , i lost my first friend at a place known as @entity117			1
it was my third week ; it changed who i was forever			0
i realized then and there that my life and the lives of my friends were really at risk			0
we were in a place where it was the job of the people who lived there to kill us			0
there was no second chance , no time out			0
as was typical of our troops , i lost all empathy for the @entity4			1
they all looked the same , and i could n't tell the ones who liked us from the ones that wanted us dead			0
as is also typical in such situations , i chose to err on the side of safety			0
" f * * * the @entity4 ! " was my attitude			1
we all knew ( or thought we knew ) that the life of one @entity148 was worth more than the lives of all of the @entity4 put together			1
if we are going to talk about rules of war , it does n't make sense to start with the soldiers and @entity148 who have been put into that situation			1
they will all tell you that the first rule is to stay alive			0
most people , when asked to choose between obeying the rules , if they believe that harm or death will come to them and their loved ones , or breaking the rules , if they believe it will keep them and their loved ones safe , choose to break the rules			1
the question is hypothetical to most people , but not to a soldier in combat			0
instead , if we 're going to talk about rules of war , we have to start with the powerful people who chose to put those soldiers there			1
the @entity176 war crime is starting a war , because all other war crimes emanate from that first crime			1
i have not been to @entity9 , but there are some evident similarities between the war there and the war in @entity4			1
both are wars of occupation			0
the people of both countries looked different from us , resulting in racial profiling			0
they are all suspects , a word that carries a suggestion of guilt			0
neither war has had an actual plan for winning			1
when people ask me if we could have won the war in @entity4 , i say that i was taught that the duty of a @entity148 is to destroy the will of the enemy to resist the authority of the @entity40			1
the way a @entity148 performs that duty is to make the price of that resistance more than the enemy can afford			0
opinion : do n't demonize our troops in @entity4 " body count " was the measure of success			1
i was told that if we killed 10 @entity4 for every @entity40 , we would win			1
we more than met that goal without , of course , winning			0
but our rule was " might makes right " -- a philosophy that my father had taught me the @entity40 had defeated in @entity224 it seems to be alive and well			0
in @entity9 , the @entity40 supposedly invaded to arrest one man			0
last year we were told he 'd been executed in @entity227			0
what is the mission now ? my mental wounds are more painful than my physical wounds			0
the cream of my generation was wasted in the rice paddies of @entity4			1
all of the sacrifices we made bought nothing but a black marble wall in @entity239			0
it pains me greatly that my country did not learn from @entity4 that it should never again to waste its children on wars of choice , but instead use civilized nonviolent methods of conflict resolution			1
today my country perpetrates the same crimes against my children 's generation			0
this is unbelievably hard for me to take			0
do we really believe that having rules on how we can murder each other in war makes the murdering clean , acceptable , and civilized behavior ? if we developed rules for rape or slavery , would they be acceptable too ? should we bring back dueling and regulate individual murder ? why is murder on a large scale treated so differently from other outrages ? i am told that killing people in war is n't murder , because it is sanctioned by the government			1
this reminds me of former president @entity269 saying " when the president does it , that means that it is not illegal			0
" in warfare , the overwhelming majority of those who suffer and are killed are civilians ? does calling them collateral damage really mitigate those losses and make them acceptable ? not to me			0
what about the laws on our books that forbid war ? the @entity287 bans all war			1
the @entity291 legalizes two types of wars , neither of which matches most of our current wars			0
our wars are neither defensive nor authorized by the @entity297			0
and the @entity40 @entity298 forbids wars not declared by @entity300 , which has not declared a war since 1941			1
as long as we are willing to accept war as a legitimate means of conflict resolution , we must be willing to accept the facts that go with war			1
mothers , fathers , aunts and uncles , grandparents and children will die and be maimed both physically and mentally			0
some of them will be in uniform , but the majority of them will just be " collateral damage			0
" our family members will come home with physical , psychological , and behavioral problems			0
we will continue to have military and @entity322 hospitals with waiting lines			0
preparing for these wars means continuing to train our children to hurt and kill other humans			0
this involves a process of dehumanization that is in conflict with the training required to produce good citizens in a democratic society			1
in my training at @entity337 , the citizen was taken out of me and i was rebuilt as a @entity148			0
we had a prayer that we recited every night when we hit the rack : " @entity340 , sir , for every day is a holiday and every meal is a feast			0
@entity347 bless the drill instructors of 353			0
" are we really willing to continue to accept all of this ? my organization , @entity355 , believes that our stories are our strength			0
we believe that by educating the public by relating our personal experiences , we can reveal the hard , ugly truth about war			1
our collective experience has taught us that war is futile and immoral			1
we believe that it is abhorrent to think of human beings as " collateral damage , " and we refuse to be silent as our government continues to pursue illegal , immoral wars of aggression			0
we believe that if the public really saw and understood the truth of war as we do -- they would end it			1
as long as we continue to accept war as an acceptable means of conflict resolution , things will remain the same			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity384 .			1

@entity384 : horror over soldiers *defiling* corpses avoids issue of our involvement in war
he says we teach kids to work out conflict , then teach soldiers to use violence in conflict
he says he too lost empathy in @entity4 ; soldiers not to blame , *warmongering* *leaders* are
@entity384 : " rules of war " a ridiculous notion . why are we still in " @entity187 ? "
