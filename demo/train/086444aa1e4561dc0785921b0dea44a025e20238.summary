@entity0 -- federal prosecutors said the defendants had a " hatred and thirst for violence , " while defense attorneys argued that an @entity6 informant was the real culprit as opening arguments got underway tuesday in the trial of four men accused in an alleged bomb plot			1
prosecutors say the men plotted to detonate explosives near two synagogues in the @entity20 section of the @entity21 in may 2009 and also sought to fire missiles at planes at an @entity25 base			1
@entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 were arrested on may 20 , 2009 , allegedly after having placed what they thought were bombs at two sites and before making their way to @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity0			0
but no bombs went off that night			0
the men were part of a year - long sting operation led by a paid @entity6 informant			1
the bombs and missiles were not , in fact , armed , but were rather part of the @entity6 's masquerade			2
and defense attorneys are calling the situation entrapment			1
assistant u.s. attorney @entity50 painted a picture in court of the defendants -- specifically , @entity26 -- as having a " hatred and thirst for violence			0
" he described the four men as having cased and photographed targets , planned their escape , and talked about public reaction			0
all the while , a fifth man in their group , a man they knew to be " @entity66 " and from whom they were receiving all their funding , was actually an @entity6 informant who had been taping their conversations and meeting with the @entity6			1
@entity50 described the informant , whose real name is @entity74 , as having been hired by the @entity6 to go to a certain mosque and listen for talk of violence against @entity78			1
according to @entity50 , @entity80 and @entity74 met several times over a period of months , during which time @entity74 convinced @entity80 that he was a representative of the @entity82 , a bogus international terrorism ring he said was based in @entity84 and was looking for recruits			0
@entity50 further charged that @entity80 expressed his desire to " kill @entity87 " and make @entity78 " pay for @entity88 and other @entity90 countries , " recruiting @entity28 and @entity27 -- who are not related -- along with @entity29 to be part of the mission to target @entity87 institutions and military operations in the @entity78			2
but defense attorneys argued that it was @entity74 , not the four defendants , who planned , funded , and directed the entire operation , seducing the poverty - stricken defendants with food , gifts , and promises of a significant payday			1
the defense painted a picture of @entity74 as a convicted felon who began working for the @entity6 as part of a plea bargain that kept him from jail and deportation , and paid him $ 100,000			2
defense attorneys alleged that @entity74 pressured the four men , whom , they said , he saw as his meal ticket , to agree to be a part of the mission , promising large sums of money and expensive cars and not taking no for an answer			1
they further alleged entrapment , as the defendants did not have violent pasts and " could not and would not have been involved in such a conspiracy without @entity74			0
" @entity126 , attorney for @entity80 , called the 100 hours of videotaped conversations between the men " not a documentary but a work of fiction ... a movie produced , directed , starred in , and edited by @entity74 and the @entity6			2
" @entity133 , attorney for @entity28 , suggested the @entity6 was more interested in instigating and initiating , rather than investigating			0
the trial will resume wednesday in @entity135 in @entity136 at 9:30 a.m. et			0

four men are on trial in @entity0 in an alleged bomb plot
they are accused to plotting to blow up two synagogues
they are also accused of plotting to fire missiles at @entity78 military planes
defense attorneys argue the men were entrapped by an @entity6 informant
