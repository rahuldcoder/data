-- a 14 - year - old @entity4 girl who had faced life in prison for allegedly burning the @entity7 will have her case heard in juvenile court , the girl 's lawyer told @entity0			1
a local court ordered the transfer on monday , @entity10 said			2
@entity4 police told @entity0 their investigation concluded @entity15 is innocent and was framed by an imam			1
" there was no legal evidence against @entity15 , " officer @entity17 told @entity0			1
these developments could mark an end to the @entity24 teen 's nightmare since she was accused of blasphemy in august			1
" this is a precursor to the case ending , and that is quite unprecedented in the 25 - year history of @entity4 's blasphemy laws , " said @entity26 , the @entity4 director of @entity27			1
accused teen : ' i 'm scared ' police have submitted the findings to the court			1
@entity4 courts usually go with what police recommend			1
there is a lot of evidence implicating imam @entity43 for framing the teenager and for himself tearing pages out of the holy book , @entity17 told @entity0			1
this is significant , said @entity27 's @entity26 , because " never before has a false accuser been held accountable			2
" the teen 's case sparked international outcry against the @entity4 government , some saying the blasphemy laws are used to settle scores and persecute religious minorities			1
blasphemy laws have been a part of life in @entity4 for 25 years , first instituted primarily to keep peace between religions , @entity26 said			1
but a military leader in @entity4 in the middle 1980s tightened the laws , introducing amendments that " essentially made blasphemy a capital offense , " @entity26 said			1
" they were vaguely worded ... and became an instrument of coercion and persecution , " he said			0
" the laws were disproportionately used against the weakest and most vulnerable in society -- religious minorities , women , children and the poor			0
" there have been 1,400 blasphemy cases since 1986 , according to @entity26			2
there are more than 15 cases of people on death row for blasphemy in @entity4 , and 52 have been killed while facing trial for the charge , @entity26 said			1
@entity15 was arrested on august 16			1
she and her family spoke to @entity0 in early september from an undisclosed location , in hiding after @entity15 was released on bail -- a move that appeared to be in reaction to the global condemnation of her jailing			2
the teen said she was happy to be with her family , but feared for her life			2
" i 'm scared , " she said by phone			0
" i 'm afraid of anyone who might kill us			0
" the teen spoke in short sentences , answering " yes " or " no " in a shy and nervous voice			2
in @entity4 , people accused of blasphemy are often attacked and sometimes killed by vigilantes			1
during @entity0 's interview with her , @entity15 said , " no , no , " when asked if she burned pages of the @entity7			1
she would n't answer questions about what happened on august 16			2
@entity4 investigators said @entity15 's neighbor accused her of burning pages of the @entity7 to use as cooking fuel			1
the neighbor began to shout in protest , drawing a crowd that grew angry			0
some neighbors said the teenager was beaten			0
others said she ran back home and locked herself inside			0
when police arrived , they arrested her			0
@entity15 's lawyers said the neighbor wanted to settle a personal score with the girl because the two did n't get along			2
they said it 's likely that he liked the teen and she did n't feel the same			0
while the latest turn in her case this week appears largely positive , her ordeal is far from over			0
the next hearing in @entity15 's case is set for october 1 in juvenile court			1
most victims of @entity4 's blasphemy laws belong to minority @entity139 sects like the @entity140 , who many of @entity4 's majority @entity141 perceive as nonbelievers , according to the @entity145 of @entity4 and @entity27			1
@entity15 's father , @entity146 , is a @entity24			2
he paints houses for a few dollars a day			0
he was adamant that no one in his family would dishonor the quran			0
" we respect the quran just like we respect the @entity153 , " he said			0
" we could n't imagine committing blasphemy , let alone doing it			0
our children would never do this either			0
" a family representative said that aid groups in the @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162 have offered to the teen and her family a home outside @entity4			1
but no matter how her case pans out , it 's unclear what kind of life she might be able to have			2
she told @entity0 in september that she wanted to stay in her home country			0
people will believe what they want to believe , no matter what the courts or police say , @entity26 said			0
" she is certainly in grave danger , " he said			0
" it 's the accusation that endangers your life , and can endure			0
" @entity0 's @entity180 contributed to this report .			0
