@entity0 , @entity1 -- strolling between shelves crammed with his records , @entity3 pauses and finds another piece of music that he just must take home			1
he is walking through a warehouse where there are about 250,000 records			2
the room seems to stretch away with his records but it is only a fraction of the collection			1
most of his five million records are in a former candle factory nearby , and another 100,000 are kept in his home -- for personal listening			1
@entity3 pulls from the shelf a copy of " @entity24 of @entity25			1
" " marvelous , " he chuckles			2
i 'm going to have to take it home			2
" which is a problem of sorts			2
@entity3 is trying to consolidate and catalog his massive vinyl collection , but every day he ends up finding some treasure or other that he sneaks out of the cataloging collection and off to his private stockpile at home			1
" what i have at home is what i have mined over the course of my life , " @entity3 tells @entity2 at his warehouse in @entity0			1
" these days , it 's things that appear out of nowhere , that i did n't even know i was looking for			0
" @entity3 , 62 , calls himself " a hunter of lost sound			1
" he is a @entity1 bus magnate whose obsession has turned him into the owner of the largest known record collection in the world -- an estimated five million singles , albums and old 78s			1
" everyone thinks i 'm obsessed with albums , " he says			0
" but really it 's an obsession with memory and history , of @entity1 and all of human kind			0
" for years he bought records -- sometimes individual albums and sometimes entire vinyl collections -- unnoticed			2
in high school , he already had 3,000 and by the time he was 30 he had amassed roughly 30,000 albums			0
a recent agreement with @entity1 authorities has allowed him to import whole shipping containers full of aging records and his collection has ballooned			1
when major international collectors or iconic shops like @entity71 's @entity70 sold off their stockpiles , nobody really knew where they were going			0
but earlier this month , the @entity74 revealed that @entity3 was the eclectic buyer behind many of the transactions			1
" now i 'm being hunted , " @entity3 laughs			1
he says most of the interest has come from sellers , but also from people searching for an obscure piece of music			0
he says : " 90 percent of the time , people are looking for something from their childhood			0
it 's often culturally irrelevant music , but for that person extremely important			0
@entity3 now wants to make his records available to the public as early as next year -- in a kind of listening library that he 'll call a @entity92			1
he has hired 17 interns to help him			0
most of them history students			0
wearing plastic gloves and surgical masks , they clean and dust the vinyl discs , photograph the covers and painstakingly catalog each album			0
they get through about 500 records a day and have so far cataloged about 250,000			2
a drop in the bucket			0
@entity3 thumbs through some of the records from his personal collection that he brought in to show us : " @entity111 " by @entity112 and @entity113 ; a signed copy of @entity110 's " @entity109 ; " and not one , but four copies of the first album made by @entity1 crooner , @entity117 , " @entity118			1
" " just the other day , we found an autographed @entity122 that i did n't even know existed ! " he says , referring to the classical @entity120 pianist			0
but one of his most treasured discoveries , he says , is a rare recording of soprano @entity126 , signed by the composer @entity127			0
@entity3 bought it on @entity129 for one dollar .			2
