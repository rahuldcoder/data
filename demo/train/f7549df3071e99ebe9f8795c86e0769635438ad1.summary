@entity0 -- the detection of high levels of radioactivity in certain @entity8 foods -- and the nation 's subsequent clampdown on their sales -- signals the food safety situation is " more serious " than originally thought , a @entity3 official said monday			1
@entity13 , the @entity14 - based spokesman for the @entity3 's regional office for the @entity16 , said his organization believes people in @entity8 " have to be cautious " about what they eat and drink			1
besides causing devastation throughout northeast @entity8 , the 9.0 - magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on march 11 seriously damaged several reactors at the @entity26 nuclear plant , leading to the release of an unspecified amount of radioactive material into the atmosphere			1
on sunday , the sale of raw milk from @entity34 and spinach from neighboring @entity36 were banned due to detected levels of radioactive iodine and cesium that surpassed government limits , @entity8 's health ministry reported			1
and officials in @entity34 halted the distribution of locally grown vegetables outside the prefecture			0
@entity13 noted that , whereas fears initially were for produce within 30 kilometers ( 18 miles ) of the plant , cows ( and the milk they produce ) outside that radius and spinach from as far as 120 kilometers was being affected			2
" quite clearly , it is not what we thought in the early stages			0
it is more serious , " he said			0
" we have seen @entity8 people in grocery stores paying close attention to where their produce is coming from , and we think this is a wise practice			2
" @entity13 's assessment -- and the @entity8 health ministry 's move -- suggests that top world and national health agencies are definitely taking the issue seriously			2
and so are people in @entity8			0
" it does n't look like a short - term issue , " said @entity70 , who lives in @entity0			0
" i 'm definitely concerned about the food that is going to be shipped out from now			0
i 'm definitely thinking about it			0
" @entity8 officials reported levels of radioactive iodine in milk from four locations in @entity34 that ranged from about 20 % over the acceptable limit to more than 17 times that limit			1
testing at one location also found levels of cesium about 5 % over the acceptable limit , the health ministry reported sunday			2
and in @entity36 , a major center of vegetable production , tests at 10 locations found iodine levels in spinach that ranged from 5 % over acceptable limits to more than 27 times that ceiling			1
at seven sites , levels of cesium grew from just above 4 % to nearly four times the limit			0
iodine and cesium isotopes are byproducts of nuclear reactors like the ones that were damaged in the march 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the northern @entity8 island of @entity105			1
while @entity107 has a radioactive half - life of eight days , cesium - 137 's half - life is about 30 years			2
a few water samples taken in the area tested positive for iodine -- although far below levels of concern under @entity8 law , according to the @entity116 website			1
the agency said it received reports from @entity8 's government that six out of 46 samples tested positive for the iodine - 131 radioactive isotope			1
the decision to prohibit food produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast @entity8 hit by the earthquake , tsunami and other potential fall - out from the @entity34 plant			2
@entity34 , northeast of @entity0 , has @entity8 's fourth - largest amount of farmland and ranks among its top producer of fruits , vegetables and rice			1
@entity36 , south of @entity34 , supplies @entity0 with a significant amount of fruits and vegetables and is @entity8 's third - largest pork producer			1
after the 1986 nuclear plant disaster in @entity144 -- then a part of the @entity141 -- tons of food had to be destroyed when radioactive debris fell on crops in large swaths of @entity148 and @entity149			0
hygiene expert @entity150 , who helped @entity8 scientists prevent contaminated food from entering the country at that time , said the current situation is no @entity144 -- but he said the current crisis is sure to affect @entity8 farmers			1
that means threatening the livelihood of people like @entity160 , an 82 - year - old woman whose family has farmed a plot in @entity163 for generations			0
" up until now , i thought everything was fine here , " said @entity160			0
" but to hear that some radiation has been found here is pretty upsetting			0
" @entity1 's @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 contributed to this report			0

a @entity3 official calls the food safety situation " more serious " than first thought
" i 'm definitely thinking about " possible radiation in food , a @entity0 says
high levels of radioactive iodine and cesium have been found in milk and spinach
the two prefectures affected *include* some of @entity8 's most productive farmland
