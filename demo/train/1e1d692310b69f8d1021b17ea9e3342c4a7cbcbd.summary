-- try finding a hotel mystery shopper willing to dish on one of their stays			1
ask them to reveal the dirt on the unkempt suite , the coquette of a concierge , or the wilted flower that sullied the room service tray			1
according to the @entity14 ( @entity15 ) there are some 30,000 of them in the @entity17 , hired by luxury hotel brands to check - in anonymously and judge mercilessly			1
but like a @entity22 agent or the rare hair stylist who 'll keep your secrets , gossip is not in the mystery shopper 's after - hours repertoire			1
even if they do n't name names , everything they unearth is strictly confidential			2
perhaps it 's to be expected in an industry where everyone , from the booking agent to the bellhop , is famously discreet			0
if loose lips sink ships , a too - revealing mystery shopper could certainly submerge an hotelier or two			1
thankfully , @entity42 , vice president of sales & marketing for the @entity45 - based @entity44 ( whose clients include @entity47 and @entity48 ) , produced a nine - year veteran willing to answer a few questions			0
@entity0 : best hotels in @entity45 the catch : we would speak by phone , with @entity42 playing watchdog , and the mystery shopper would remain nameless and description-less -- more incognito than @entity57 on holiday			1
even by phone , the woman radiated confidence			0
she 'd completed over 500 mystery shops in luxury hotels on four continents , and her voice came through the wires sternly , as if she 'd been in upper management a day too long			1
she works as an independent contractor ( paid by the job )			0
what she looks for at each hotel varies from client to client -- some brands maintain a checklist of ten things to look for upon arrival , others more than 80			1
" i pack a measuring tape , because a few hotels want me to get down to the @entity81 , " she says			0
" is the radius of light emitted from the lamp exact ? is the paint on the walls in a particular palette ? " 5 @entity89 alternatives occasionally , she 'll check in as the most obnoxious breed of hotel guest : the road - weary whiner			2
" i 'll call the front desk and say the room smells like smoke even when it does n't , just to see how they 'll respond , " she says			0
fake - outs are staged and executed thoroughly ; she 'll go as far as to empty the batteries from the remote and grumble about the fritzy @entity102 , or unhook the chain from the toilet to time how long it takes the staff to fix it			0
it 's an exacting art. after she checks out , her report is written up , fact - checked by @entity109 , and delivered back to the client in a matter of weeks			0
@entity112 : the best new hotels 2012 " my goal , honestly , is to get hotels to provide the highest possible level of service , " she says			2
" when i return to these properties personally -- and i do , if they 're great -- i get such satisfaction seeing that			0
" in the era of @entity125 and @entity126 , when travelers can report anything at all to the googling masses , trustworthy accounts are more important than ever to hoteliers			1
@entity109 is n't alone in providing unbiased evaluations to luxury brands that clamor for it			1
27 must - sees on earth @entity135 , senior vice president of sales and marketing at @entity137 , a mystery shopping firm based in @entity138 , says they maintain a stable of 120 full time consultants who travel 42 weeks out of the year			2
they too are tight - lipped , but happy to tell you their standards , which alter depending on the client			0
is there a seasonally appropriate fruit at the front desk ? did you get a call from the concierge within thirty minutes of check - in ? are the amenities @entity156 & @entity157 and perfectly arranged ? competition for the positions is fierce : you 're required to have three years of management experience in the hospitality industry , excellent written and interpersonal skills , and a credit line of up to $ 7,500 -- presumably for booking your travel , which is reimbursed in its entirety			2
once you 're hired , there are other hurdles ( namely , weeks of training at @entity169 , learning the intricacies of each luxury brand			1
) the coursework is hush hush , of course , but it may be among the cushiest of educational experiences on the planet			0
one can picture these people lazing about in hotel robes , fawning over thread count quantities and proper lobby manner with equal zeal			2
@entity0 : @entity17 's best cities for singles the concept of sending in a ringer to report back is nothing new			1
mystery shopping began in the 1930s with three men touring the country , staking out @entity194 's and @entity195 's ( now @entity195 ) department stores			2
it gained traction during the civil rights era , when the government hired black and white " customers " to investigate the compliance , and the prolific lack thereof , to desegregation laws in restaurants and corner stores alike			0
today it 's a $ 1.5 billion - a - year production , a large chunk of which is travel - based			0
" in the late 1980s , @entity215 was among the first luxury hotel brands to utilize the service , " says @entity210 , co-owner and president of @entity212 and one of the original founders of the @entity15			1
three decades later , it 's common practice among hotel brands around the world			2
( proof : @entity137 recently opened a satellite office in busy @entity224			0
) and soon enough , its taciturn nature may be over			0
" you 'll see the secretive side of mystery shopping change ; it 's becoming a vestige of the past , " says @entity226 , a former executive at both @entity109 and @entity137 and now vice president of brand strategy for @entity228 , a hospitality marketing agency			1
the wealth of online reviews has reignited the idea that the customer 's feedback is not only important , but critical to success			1
@entity47 recently announced that it 's allowing guest commentary , both good and bad , on its own websites ; and more and more guests are leaving feedback directly on @entity243			0
" hoteliers read online reviews thoroughly , " @entity226 says			1
" if they notice a trend there that speaks to a problem , they have mystery shoppers to go in and test it with surgical precision			1
" essentially , they 're hiring people to complain so you never have to			2
and in the thoughtfulness - driven economy of high - end hotels , that might be the most considerate act of all			0
