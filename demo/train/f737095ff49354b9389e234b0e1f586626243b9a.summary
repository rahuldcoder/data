a little under two years ago , @entity0 was a mere 90 minutes away from being crowned champion of @entity3			2
the @entity5 final against domestic rival @entity6 at @entity7 on may 25 , 2013 did n't quite go to plan , but for a team that had won back - to - back @entity12 titles against the odds in the previous two seasons , there was still plenty to smile about			1
" we will come back , maybe not to @entity7 , but we will try to come back to another final , " @entity0 coach @entity16 said after the final whistle			2
fast - forward to february 2015 , and the club with such lofty ambitions finds itself bottom of a @entity12 table it had previously been used to ruling			1
seven of the players who graced the @entity7 turf for @entity0 two seasons ago took to the field wednesday against @entity30 -- a game that would prove to be the nadir of a so far disastrous campaign			1
@entity16 's men slumped to a 1 - 0 defeat at home to a side reduced to 10 men , with further salt rubbed into the wound by the fact that @entity30 had never before beaten @entity0 in its history			1
the latest defeat proved to be the tipping point , with fans at the @entity46 finally venting their anger and frustrations after having stayed patient through previous setbacks			0
so much so that , after the match , a couple of @entity0 players were moved to publicly apologize to the supporters , with @entity55 speaking to them through the perimeter fence			0
goalkeeper @entity58 went even further , scaling the fence to ensure a more intimate dialogue with the unhappy @entity0 fans			2
confidence has drained away and , with every passing defeat against the underdogs of @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68 , @entity0 's next win seems ever harder to secure			1
" there 's no doubt that nerves play a part in our situation , " @entity16 told the @entity0 website after wednesday 's defeat			2
" we need to bring them under control			0
" a club that finished the 2011 - 12 season as champion with just three losses to its name has now suffered 11 defeats from 19 games this term , with relegation from @entity89 's top flight for the first time since 1972 a real possibility			1
what makes @entity0 's decline even more galling is the ceding of dominance to @entity6 , which has made a habit of poaching of its star players -- notably @entity100 and @entity101			1
a talented team admittedly , @entity0 have struggled with injuries this season , and wednesday 's defeat by @entity30 brought further bad news on that front after @entity108 suffered a torn thigh muscle , ruling him out for the next six weeks			1
even so , a team still boasting world - class talent such as @entity112 and @entity55 -- reported targets for some of the game 's biggest clubs -- should be sitting above the majority of teams in its division			0
" we 're always chasing games , " bemoaned @entity55 after the @entity30 setback			0
" what 's missing is us taking the lead so that we can then sit back and play on the counter			0
we 're all aware that we 've got to fight in the next 15 games			0
" surely @entity0 are too good to go down ? one only needs to take a quick glance at the @entity5 to notice that on its day , the club can still prove to be a match for @entity3 's best			1
@entity0 remains in @entity3 's premier competition after topping a group also including @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , with a 2 - 0 victory against the @entity137 in september showcasing the side at its most fearsome			2
without the pressures and trappings of the @entity12 , @entity0 is a different beast altogether			2
@entity144 champion @entity142 awaits in the last 16 , and you would not bet against @entity0 progressing to the quarterfinals			0
the same can not be said of its league clash with @entity148 saturday			0
but @entity149 go down ? part of the problem is often acknowledging that there is , indeed , a problem			0
@entity16 , in his own mild - mannered way , has refused to hit the panic button and has been under little pressure from the @entity89 media , while the club 's board has yet to publicly question the coach			1
the @entity0 fans , too , known as some of the most passionate in the world , have continued to voice their support			0
" there are several stadiums with a great atmosphere in the world , but only a few who go wild like [ @entity0 's ] when you are [ struggling ] , " @entity16 said of the club 's fans in december			1
reports , meanwhile , have suggested that @entity0 will give @entity16 -- who to some , given the resources at his disposal , has taken the club as far as he can -- until the end of the month to offer up signs of survival			0
realization has struck that @entity0 's quality alone will not be enough to turn things around and something has to change soon , with the one - month winter break failing to turn around its fortunes			1
if it does n't , the @entity0 team widely considered too good to go down may end up doing just that .			0

@entity0 sits bottom of the @entity89 @entity12 table
@entity0 's most recent loss to @entity30 left its fans angry and frustrated
the @entity89 club won back - to - back @entity12 titles in 2011 and 2012
