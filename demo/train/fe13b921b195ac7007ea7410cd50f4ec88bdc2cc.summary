-- rising from the desert like a space - age skyscraper , there is something equally awe - inspiring and unnerving about the five - star @entity5			2
at night , the sleek glass building glows green and purple , its distinctive crescent roof looming high above the manicured race track below			2
it 's an opulent and eerily futuristic setting befitting the richest horse race on the planet -- the @entity14 , which kicks off this weekend			1
with more than $ 27 million in prize money on offer over the 11 - day carnival , it 's little wonder the world 's greatest race horses , and their influential entourage , flock every year to the @entity24			1
but can the grand architectural statements and megabucks compete with the prestige of centuries - old races like the @entity28 and @entity29 ? the country 's ruler , sheik @entity30 , seems to think it can , and he 's willing to dig into his deep pockets to ensure @entity34 is very much on the international horse racing map			1
" @entity38 has to do with the tradition and culture of the region , " said chief executive of the @entity14 @entity37			1
" we 're 17 - years - old , so we 're still very young			0
" " you can have a prestigious race , but you can also have the very best race horses in the world -- which is what we have			1
" @entity49 's sporting muscle launched in 1996 , the @entity14 is a relatively new player on the horse racing circuit , and carving out a name as an internationally renowned competition has taken huge investment			1
while the @entity58 and @entity59 battle against austerity measures , the @entity49 's wealthy horse - mad sheikhs are pumping billions of dollars into boosting the region 's racing status			1
" throughout my career , sheik @entity30 has been the most influential man in the horse racing world , " said @entity58 @entity63 , who last year won the award for most outstanding trainer in the @entity58 " he breeds thoroughbreds , he buys them , he competes them -- he does everything			1
he has very deep pockets in the game and he 's willing to spread the wealth around			0
" it 's part of a larger campaign by the oil - rich @entity49 to become a premier sporting destination -- and not just for horses			1
@entity80 will be the first @entity81 state to host the @entity82 in 2022 , while investors across the region continue to buy up @entity59 football teams			0
among the big players are the @entity87 , which owns @entity89 's @entity88 , and @entity91 businessman @entity90 , who last year bought @entity94 club @entity93			0
cutting - edge course back on home turf in the @entity24 , the $ 1 billion @entity97 -- headquarters of the @entity14 -- is the glittering crown in sheik @entity30 's racing empire			1
the grandstand alone is 1.6 kilometers long , while the site boasts a 285 - room luxury hotel with roof - top pool , a marina , racing museum , and @entity107 theatre			0
" it 's over-the - top , it 's just gorgeous , everything about it is first class , " @entity108 said of the @entity5 where he is staying before competing in saturday 's race			1
" it 's almost futuristic -- everything is brand new and spotless with shiny glass and metal			2
" the high - tech course , which champion @entity122 jockey @entity121 famously described as " like a spaceship from ' @entity124 , " is worlds apart from the classic southern charm of the @entity128 's @entity127			2
" you ca n't buy history , " said @entity63 , who won the @entity129 in 2005			0
" you do n't have that deep sense of tradition here that you have at the @entity128			0
" history of horses the @entity138 's racing circuit may still be forging a name for itself , but the region 's passion for horses is centuries old			0
the thoroughbred we know today dates back to three @entity81 horses brought to @entity146 around the turn of the 17th century			0
" the horse is a very significant part of people 's lives here , " @entity37 said			2
" people love the sport and they love the culture -- it 's about the beauty of the horse			0
" eyes on the prize @entity34 's record prize money , field of world - class horses and impressive backdrop will ensure that the eyes of the world are watching this saturday			1
" when i won in 2005 it absolutely changed my career , " said @entity63			0
" i went home from @entity34 on a different level -- people looked at me differently			0
" " i had proved i could win on an international stage and i was given better horses to train			0
" and with $ 10 million up for grabs in the flagship race , there are still many things money can buy .			2
