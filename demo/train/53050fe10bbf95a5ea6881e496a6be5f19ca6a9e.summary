-- no image is more central to the story of @entity3 than that of baby jesus in the arms of his mother , @entity7			1
it was painted and sculpted over and over again , by such artists as @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			0
it 's a picture of tender mercy and boundless love between a mother and her son			1
but these first gentle moments ( even experienced in the humble environs of a manger ) are perhaps the easiest of any parent - child relationship			1
the story that would develop for @entity5 and his mother , as presented in the gospels , was complicated , and not very unlike what happens in many families : a tale of enchantment , then disenchantment , of resistance and reconciliation			1
the first scene in the @entity34 after the nativity occurs when @entity5 is 12 , on the cusp of adolescence			1
the boy accompanies his family to @entity40 for @entity41 week			0
after the celebrations , his family leaves -- failing to notice that @entity5 has been left behind			1
searching for three frantic days , at last they find him in @entity45 's great @entity44 , among a group of elders , who are amazed by his knowledge of the scriptures			0
when @entity7 questions him about his behavior , @entity5 replies somewhat testily : " why did you come looking for me ? did n't you know i must be about my father 's business ? " okay			1
he was smart , perhaps a bit sassy			2
as the only glimpse we get of @entity5 before the age of 30 , it 's a telling instance , however			2
flash forward 20 years or so , when @entity5 begins his ministry in @entity63			2
his family , however , does n't seem happy			0
he is , for a start , attracting large crowds			0
he goes about healing people , casting out demons			0
in @entity69 , it 's clear the family wishes he would cease and desist			0
" he is out of his mind , " they cry			0
soon after this , @entity5 says dismissively : " here are my mother and my brothers ! whoever does @entity78 's will is my brother and sister and mother			1
" ( @entity69 3:34 - 35 ) at the marriage in @entity83 , where @entity5 performs the first of his many " signs and wonders , " @entity7 accompanies him , complaining to her son that the hosts have run out of wine			1
he turns on her : " woman , what have i to do with thee ? mine hour is not yet come			0
" ( @entity94 ) this sounds harsh			0
but @entity5 has a symbolic point , and he makes it , turning six stone pots of water into wine			2
it 's a sign that he will not be bound by the laws of nature			0
one does n't see @entity7 again until she stands in all her sorrow at the foot of the cross with a few other women who were close to her son			1
she was presumably a widow by this point , as @entity109 is not mentioned			0
@entity5 , as her oldest son , is responsible for her well - being			1
and here he is , dying before her eyes in this public and humiliating way			0
intriguingly , he summons his most beloved disciple , probably @entity113 ( though nobody knows for sure ) , asking him to look after @entity7 when he is gone			2
" here is your mother , " he says			2
this was surely an act of love			0
our last view of @entity7 in the @entity34 is in the @entity123 in @entity40 , where she meets with the 11 disciples after her son 's death			1
they are planning to pick a 12th disciple at this point -- to replace @entity130			0
this moment precedes the @entity132 -- the arrival of the @entity134 in tongues of flame			0
obviously @entity7 has , by this time , begun to play a role in the early @entity139 movement , though the scriptures say little about this			2
much that we think about @entity7 , in fact , is the stuff of legend -- things added to her story by later @entity139 writers and artists			1
the @entity34 offer only a few glimpses of her , beginning in @entity151 , by the manger , with a helpless child bringing light into a fallen world			0
in the course of his three decades , @entity5 and @entity7 had a tender but complex relationship , with misunderstandings -- again , the stuff of family life writ large			1
yet their relations ended on a note of deep accord , with @entity7 taking on her role as " mother of @entity78 , " becoming an important figure in the early church			1
and we think of her at @entity3 , this woman " full of grace , " who , with @entity173 child in arms , was " blessed among women			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			2

@entity177 : the image of @entity5 in arms of his mother , @entity7 , is central to @entity3 story
like many mother - child relationships , @entity5 ' with his mother grew complicated , he says
he says records are scant , but gospels show sometimes testy , sassy exchanges
@entity177 : @entity5 , good son , would *ultimately* ask *apostle* to care for ' mother of *god* ' when he died
