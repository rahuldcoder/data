-- @entity1 follows you everywhere			1
it 's on phones and computers , at work and home , and in the news			0
so it 's understandable that people might need a little rest from the social network			2
new research suggests that @entity1 fatigue may be setting in with some users			1
twenty - seven percent of @entity1 users surveyed in the @entity17 plan to spend less time on the site in 2013 , compared with only 3 % who plan to spend more time , according to a study from the @entity23 's @entity22			1
( another 69 % of @entity1 users say they plan to spend the same amount of time on the site this coming year			1
) the @entity23 study also found that 61 % of @entity1 users have taken a break from the service for several weeks or more			1
during these breaks , the vast majority of @entity1 vacationers do n't delete their profiles			1
the site boasts that it has more than a billion active users			2
@entity23 found that two - thirds , or 67 % , of @entity17 adults who are online use @entity1			1
the reasons people gave for taking a sabbatical from the network were varied			0
the most common motivation was not having enough time for the site , with 21 % of people saying they were just too busy with real - life responsibilities to spend time reading posts , liking and commenting			1
other reasons for leaving : ten percent called it a waste of time , 10 % cited a lack of interest in the content , and 9 % said they were unhappy with the amount of drama and gossip on the site			1
only 4 % of people mentioned privacy and security concerns as their reason for taking a breather			2
among the comments from those who took @entity1 breaks : " i was tired of stupid comments			2
" ... " ( i had ) crazy friends			0
i did not want to be contacted			0
" ... " i took a break when it got boring			0
" ... " it was not getting me anywhere			0
" ... " you get burned out on it after a while			0
" ... " i gave it up for @entity76			0
" ... " people were ( posting ) what they had for dinner			0
" ... " i did n't like being monitored			0
" ... " i got harassed by someone from my past who looked me up			0
" ... " it caused problems in my ( romantic ) relationship			0
" not everyone who leaves @entity1 comes back to the site			2
according to @entity23 , 20 % of online adults who currently do n't use @entity1 formerly maintained a profile on the site			1
the number of @entity1 users in the @entity17 may be plateauing , as only 8 % of non-users said they would be interested in joining			1
@entity94 's company needs to keep its users active on the site and mobile apps , especially since the pool of untapped of potential new members in the @entity17 is dwindling			2
if @entity1 starts to feel stale , more of its active users could take longer breaks or leave altogether , like they did with such formerly hot social networks as @entity103 and @entity104 .			1
