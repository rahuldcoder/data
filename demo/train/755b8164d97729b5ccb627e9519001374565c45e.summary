@entity0 , @entity1 -- the number of movies nominated for the best picture @entity6 will double next year , a move apparently aimed at bolstering sagging ratings for the @entity6 broadcast			1
@entity10 exults in an @entity6 win for " @entity12 " earlier this year			1
" having 10 @entity16 nominees is going allow academy voters to recognize and include some of the fantastic movies that often show up in the other @entity6 categories , but have been squeezed out of the race for the top prize , " @entity13 , president of the @entity14 , said			1
doubling the nominations would make it more likely a viewer 's favorite movie is in the running for the top honor , which may make them want to watch the show , said @entity30 , author of " @entity32 : @entity33 and @entity34 dealings backstage at the @entity6			2
" " this clearly is a reaction to declining ratings , " @entity35 said			1
" even though this last show the ratings were up ... over the last 10 years or so the ratings have been down			2
" @entity6 producers realized they " can juice the show up all you want , but people watch the @entity6 when there are movies competing that they have an interest in , " @entity35 said			2
the best picture nominations often consist of movies that " the vast majority of people have not seen , " he said			0
the problem " came to a head with ' @entity51 , ' " which sold more than $ 1 billion in tickets worldwide , but was snubbed by the academy in the best picture category last year , he said			2
the @entity57 sequel won best movie at the @entity59 and was chosen favorite movie @entity61			0
it also made many critics ' top 10 lists			0
if the nomination field had been expanded last year , the film might have made the best picture list , " which clearly would have been some kind of bump in the ratings , " @entity35 said			1
this would also counter the impression among tv viewers that the awards show is " for movie snobs who do n't like the movies i like , " he said			0
the decision to double the number of features films nominated is a return to the way the @entity6 were awarded in its early decades , when as many as 12 movies were considered in the field of finalists , @entity13 said			1
" after more than six decades , the @entity6 is returning to some of its earlier roots , when a wider field competed for the top award of the year , " @entity13 said			1
" the final outcome , of course , will be the same -- one best picture winner -- but the race to the finish line will feature 10 , not just five , great movies from 2009			0
" nominations for the @entity99 will be announced on february 2 , 2010			0
the awards show is set for march 7 at @entity102 's @entity101			0
a best picture nomination often serves as a marketing boost for films , driving dvd sales for those films no longer in theaters .			0
