her representative , @entity12 , confirmed the death to @entity0			0
the cause of death was not revealed			0
in the late - ' 80s era of the show that also featured @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and later @entity22 , @entity16 was the definition of a team player , always putting the sketch first			1
it was a character - actress attitude , one admired by others on the show			1
" she was totally amazing as a sketch player , " one of her colleagues , @entity28 , told @entity31			0
" she so immersed herself in her characters , and her timing was amazing			0
she got it from some crazy stratosphere , and i was so attracted to that talent in her , and i do n't think she ever knew how well respected and admired she was for her talent , " said @entity28 , who also dated @entity16 for a while			1
@entity16 ' ability can best be seen in her portrayal of @entity7 , part of the evangelist couple who co-founded the @entity45 and were later embroiled in scandal			1
@entity7 , in many ways , was an easy target : an overwrought figure who wore heavy eye makeup , the very caricature of an evangelist 's wife			0
but @entity16 found something deeper , as she showed in a " @entity57 " sketch during the days when @entity45 was in trouble due to a @entity60 affair and accusations of high living by the couple			1
@entity16 also stood out with her portrayal of @entity65 , the blonde half of an effervescent pair of lounge singers who ladled on bad jokes and schmaltzy versions of pop hits , ignorant of their over-the - top performances			1
they regularly included a clanging version of " @entity75 " from the ' 40s movie " @entity77			0
" but @entity16 generally shunned the star turns others took on the show			1
in " the @entity81 , " a parody of " @entity83 " led by @entity19 's @entity84 , she was a deadly serious @entity8 , letting @entity85 get the laughs for his tough - talking @entity84			2
@entity16 was on " snl " from 1986 to 1991			1
she was n't planning to leave the show , she later said , but was offered a part on " @entity89 " and could n't pass up the opportunity			1
she played @entity91 for two seasons on the show , which was set in @entity93 , right next to her hometown			1
@entity16 was born in @entity95 , @entity96 , in 1957			2
after moving to @entity97 and @entity98 in her teen years , she returned to @entity93 and joined a comedy troupe named the @entity101 , where she met writers @entity103 and @entity104			2
the three soon had jobs on a @entity107 show built around the offbeat @entity108 , back when @entity107 was @entity110 's @entity111 - airing " superstation			0
" ( @entity108 later became a @entity0 showbiz correspondent			0
) the @entity113 -- no relation to @entity110 -- also worked on " snl " and later created " @entity115 , " which occasionally featured @entity16			2
