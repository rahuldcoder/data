-- i ca n't believe i 'm saying this , but @entity3 is 100 % correct -- at least when it comes to immigration reform			1
and just so it 's clear : i was never a @entity3 supporter			2
in fact , i made a living during his presidency telling jokes that mocked him , from his policies to his greatest weakness -- speaking @entity15			0
but @entity3 's statement this week on immigration reform was right on target			1
the ex-president told attendees at a naturalization ceremony on wednesday : " we 're a nation of immigrants , and we must uphold that tradition , which has strengthened our country in so many ways			0
" i hope during the debate that we keep a benevolent spirit in mind , and we understand the positive contributions immigrants make to our country			0
... but we have a problem , the laws governing the immigration system are n't working			0
" a majority of @entity38 think our immigration system is in dire need of repair			1
indeed , a recent @entity43 poll found that 76 % of @entity38 believe it 's important to pass major immigration reform , with 74 % favoring a pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the @entity49 , i 'm touting not only @entity3 but also a @entity43 poll as well			1
( clearly , the apocalypse ca n't be too far			0
) so what has @entity52 done to address the issue ? well , in june the @entity55 passed legislation with bipartisan support to overhaul the immigration system			2
the proposed law would greatly increase border security by requiring the completion of a 700 - mile fence along our @entity64 boundary , adding 20,000 more border agents and spending more than $ 3 billion in border monitoring technology			0
in addition , it would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants after they fulfill numerous conditions , including waiting 13 years and paying back taxes			0
with polls showing so much support for immigration reform , you would assume that the bill will soon become the law of the land			1
but there 's one huge problem : the @entity84 control the @entity85			2
this week , @entity85 @entity84 leaders made it clear that the @entity55 bill would not be brought to a vote because it does not have sufficient support of @entity84 members			1
@entity85 @entity84 especially oppose the pathway to citizenship provision			1
so what 's going to happen to immigration reform ? well , @entity85 @entity84 did say there 's a chance of enacting laws that focuses on border security			1
the @entity84 truly has an existential question to answer : will it remain a national political party or just a regional one ? that 's the stake with immigration reform			1
just look at the 2012 election			0
@entity84 presidential nominee @entity106 received only 27 % of the @entity108 vote			2
that is a lower percentage than what @entity84 presidential candidates received in the past three elections			2
@entity114 make up 16 % of our population , and their numbers will only grow			0
opposition to immigration reform will likely take a toll on the @entity84 in upcoming elections			1
but this is not an issue that concerns only @entity108			0
it also hits close to home for many , if not all , other immigrant communities in @entity38			2
why would @entity85 @entity84 refuse to enact a law that is good policy and good politics ? there are many reasons			1
one is that many @entity85 @entity84 represent grotesquely gerrymandered conservative districts that give them little incentive to compromise			1
two , they are being bullied by loudmouths on the right such as @entity135 , @entity49 sen. @entity136 of @entity137 and others			0
former vice-presidential candidate @entity139 even got into the action urging people via her @entity143 post to : " join the mama grizzlies who are rearing up tirelessly to swat away false claims that amnesty is a good thing			0
" ( whenever i 'm on the fence about an issue , i will see where @entity139 stands and then take the opposite view because i know that 's the correct one			0
) perhaps these words of @entity3 can inspire @entity85 @entity84 to do the right thing : " rarely is the question asked : is our children learning ? " ok , that 's not relevant but it makes me laugh every time			1
actually , what @entity3 said this week sums it up : " we can uphold our traditions of assimilating immigrants and honoring our heritage of a nation built on the rule of law			2
" let 's hope @entity85 @entity84 have the courage to stand up to those on the far right of their party and not focus solely on building walls at the border but also on helping @entity38 remain the great melting pot that it is			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			0

@entity177 : @entity3 is 100 % correct on immigration reform
@entity177 : @entity85 @entity84 should take a page from the former president
he says the @entity84 will likely take a hit in upcoming elections if they block reform
@entity177 : a majority of @entity38 support reform , so what is the @entity84 thinking ?
