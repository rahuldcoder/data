go get them , " another post warned			0
gov. @entity46 initially accused those behind the messages of " terrorism			2

in a debate in the state 's congress tuesday , opposition lawmakers called on @entity46 to retract the initiative , arguing that the document was designed to help two people but could have a much broader impact			1
a lawyer representing suspects @entity67 and @entity69 said his clients would not use the new provision in @entity7 state 's penal code to defend themselves			2
