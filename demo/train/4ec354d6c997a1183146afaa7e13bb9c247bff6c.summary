the procedure is considered a milestone in the estimated $ 50 billion cleanup operation more than two years after a massive earthquake and tsunami brought disaster to the facility			1
when the tsunami swamped the plant , located 149 miles ( 240 kilometers ) north of @entity19 on @entity5 's eastern seaboard in march 2011 , it cut the power to vital cooling systems for the three reactors in use at the time			1
this resulted in the second - worst nuclear accident in history -- after @entity28 in the @entity29 in 1986 -- as the reactors melted down and leaked radioactive material into the atmosphere			0
on monday , @entity1 revealed " preparatory work " was underway , with a remote - controlled crane lowered inside @entity34			2
some 1,500 spent fuel units will then be lifted from the cooling pool in specially - designed containers , or casks , and closed with a lid			1
following decontamination , these casks will be taken down to ground level and transported to the common spent fuel pool on a trailer			2
the entire removal of all fuel inside the @entity48 spent fuel pool is expected to take until the end of 2014 , @entity1 says			1
' @entity52 approach ' the @entity4 cleanup has been beset by numerous problems , with @entity1 frequently criticized for its handling of the disaster			1
earlier this year , @entity5 's @entity57 , @entity58 , compared its " stopgap approach " to a game of " @entity61			0
" the government has since stepped in and pledged $ 470 million to try to tackle the leaks , through measures , which by its own admission are unconventional and untested			0
@entity1 has been pumping huge volumes of water into the plant -- hundreds of tons daily -- to cool the crippled reactors that once powered the plant			1
but this water , which becomes highly radioactive once it comes into contact with the plant 's fuel rods , has been stored in makeshift , hastily - built storage tanks around the site -- about 1,000 so far -- containing enough irradiated water to fill about 160 @entity74 - sized swimming pools , with about 400 tons added to the tanks daily			2
ongoing leaks scientists who monitor radiation levels offshore have pointed to evidence of an ongoing leak for more than a year , but it was only recently that @entity1 admitted it was occurring			0
last month , @entity1 said one of the storage tanks at the site had leaked 300 tons of toxic water , prompting @entity5 's nuclear regulator to declare the situation a @entity96 serious incident , its most serious assessment since the 2011 meltdown			1
it has since stated that several tanks and pipes at the plant are suspected of leaking toxic water			0
@entity102 , a nuclear engineer and former @entity105 power plant operator , told @entity0 in september that the eventual failure of the tanks years after they were deployed on a supposedly temporary , emergency basis is illustrative of @entity1 's ad hoc , unsustainable response to the disaster			0
" given the cards they were dealt , building a tank farm to hold the water in the heat of the emergency , there was really there only one option , so i do n't fault them for that , " he said			0
but beyond the emergency response , @entity1 had demonstrated no long - term vision for dealing with the problem , he said			0
