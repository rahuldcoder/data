@entity0 , @entity1 -- the boy wears an expressionless porcelain face and holds his right arm outstretched			0
standing still , he could be a clothing store dummy			0
but crank the handle on the box below , and row after row of brass wheels begin to turn			0
the 200 - year - old boy lowers his pencil to write			1
guardian the mechanical automaton sits in the @entity15 in @entity0 , @entity1 , writing his three poems in intricate , scrolling cursive -- as he has since @entity19 first set eyes on him over 75 years ago			1
@entity19 was six or seven years old then , he remembers , and was instantly transfixed by the way the revolving brass discs made the boy move with fluid , lifelike movements			1
now 85 , @entity19 is the boy 's caretaker , and passes on the mechanism 's secrets to the next generation			1
the " @entity33 - writer , " as the boy is known , is the most complex automaton of its kind			1
clockwork boy it was created in @entity36 in the late 18th century			0
but when it arrived at the @entity15 , the identity of its inventor was unknown			0
once set to work , the boy told all : " written by the automaton of @entity43 " says a line traced along the edge of one of his ornamented poems			1
having left the workshop of @entity43 , the famed @entity52 clockmaker responsible for the bewildering mechanism inside the boy , the automaton 's journey from @entity36 to @entity0 is largely a mystery -- although it is known he toured @entity55 for a time			2
friendship now , at least , it has found a home with @entity19 , who speaks fondly of his old friend			2
after all these years , the bond is stronger than ever : " the longer i know him , the more respect i have for the mysteries of how he works			0
" watch the video above to find out more about @entity19 and the clockwork automaton .			2

the 200 - year - old mechanical boy can write poems and draw pictures
@entity19 first saw him as a boy
today , he is caretaker for the automaton
