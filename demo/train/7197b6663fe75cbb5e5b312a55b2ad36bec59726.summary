as further proof that you can now 3d - print anything , a company called @entity2 has introduced a 3d printer for food			2
the " @entity13 , " as it 's called , is n't too different from a regular 3d printer , but instead of printing with plastics , it deploys edible ingredients squeezed out of stainless steel capsules : " it 's the same technology , " says @entity14 , co-founder of @entity2 , " but with plastics there 's just one melting point , whereas with food it 's different temperatures , consistencies and textures			1
also , gravity works a little bit against us , as food does n't hold the shape as well as plastic			0
" the @entity30 - based startup behind the machine says it 's the only one of its kind capable of printing a wide range of dishes , from sweet to savory			1
" in essence , this is a mini food manufacturing plant shrunk down to the size of an oven , " @entity14 said , pointing out that at least in the initial stage the printer will be targeted mostly at professional kitchen users , with a consumer version to follow , at a projected retail price of around $ 1,000			1
in principle , the @entity13 sounds like the ultimate laziness aid : press a button to print your ravioli			1
but @entity2 is quick to point out that it 's designed to take care only of the difficult and time - consuming parts of food preparation that discourage people from cooking at home , and that it promotes healthy eating by requiring fresh ingredients prepared before printing			1
nevertheless , the company is working with major food manufacturers to create pre-packaged plastic capsules that can just be loaded into the machine to make food , even though they assure these will be free of preservatives , with a shelf life limited to five days			1
the printing process is slow , but faster than regular 3d printing			1
other than being capable of creating complex designs , such as very detailed cake decorations or food arranged in unusual shapes , the @entity13 can be useful for recipes that require precision and dexterity , like homemade pizza or filled pasta			2
currently , the device only prints the food , which must be then cooked as usual			0
but a future model will also cook the preparation and produce it ready to eat			0
the idea also comes with a social element too			0
" there 's a touchscreen on the front that connects to a recipe site in the cloud , so it 's an internet - of - things , connected kitchen appliance , " said @entity14			1
users will also be able to control the device remotely using a smartphone , and share their recipes with the community			0
that is , if people do n't balk at the idea of eating printed food			0
" we have done tests and everybody liked the food , " explains @entity14			0
" take the microwave oven , for example : in the 70s , people were a bit fearful about it , they thought food could be poisoned with radiation or something , but fast forward 30 years , and there 's one in every household			0
this is real food , with real fresh ingredients , it 's just prepared using a new technology			2
" the company is completing a round of financing and plans to begin mass manufacturing in the second half of 2015			0
create , innovate : meet the world 's first 1,000 mph car @entity128 nose can sniff out cancer the race is on for flying cars			2

" @entity13 " is a machine that uses 3d printing technology to create meals
it uses *normal* ingredients that must be loaded into stainless steel capsules
it is controlled via a touchscreen device that connects to the internet
it will be available in late 2015 with a price tag of around $ 1,000
