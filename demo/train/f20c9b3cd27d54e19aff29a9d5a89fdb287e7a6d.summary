we 're bringing it back so you can protect yourself at the pool and beach this summer			0
happy " do n't @entity10 ! " ( @entity11 ) -- unless you 've been living under a rock , you know to apply sunscreen			2
there 's lifesaving reason to : about 3.5 million cases of skin cancer will be diagnosed this year			1

select a sunscreen you love finding your sunscreen soul - mate is the key motivating factor for using it regularly , experts agree			2
" if you think your sunscreen is pasty , thick or smelly , you have the wrong kind , " says dr. @entity36 , clinical associate professor of dermatology at @entity38			2
" it may make you less likely to put it on , or to reapply when you do			2
" happily , there are plenty of lightweight , sheer formulas on the market			0
@entity11 : which sunscreen is best for you ? remember , @entity49 30 is the new 15 as a general rule , @entity49 15 blocks 93 % of @entity52 rays , @entity49 30 blocks 97 % and @entity49 50 blocks 98 %			1
doctors now typically recommend at least @entity49 30 -- at least being the key words			1
if you have a family history of skin cancer or are vacationing in a tropical spot ( where the sun is especially intense ) , go for 50 or even 70			1
just keep in mind : no sunscreen provides 100 % protection			1
so to be safe as possible , you still need to reapply every two hours and after a swim , even if you used the water - resistant kind , says dr. @entity65 , director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at @entity68 in @entity69			1
fyi , sunscreen becomes less effective about three years after you open the container			2
@entity11 : is it a mole ... or skin cancer ? check labels for the term broad - spectrum it means the sunscreen provides protection against both @entity81 ( wrinkle - and cancer - causing ) and @entity52 ( burning ) rays			1
problem is , that labeling rule only went into effect in december and stores still sell inventory made prior to it , notes dr. @entity89 , director of dermatologic surgery and dermatology at @entity92 in @entity93 , @entity94			0
so if you 're shopping and there 's no broad - spectrum mention , check the ingredients for zinc or avobenzone , the only two that provide top - notch @entity81 coverage , he says			0
@entity11 : 7 ways you 're aging your skin layer it on think you apply enough ? almost no one does			1
" several big studies show that most people rub in only about a fourth of what 's needed to reach the labeled @entity49 -- it 's faster and easier to put on just a bit , " notes @entity36			1
instead of that old advice to use a shot glass - size dose , all our experts recommend applying two coats			0
squeeze a line of lotion down your arms and legs and rub in , then do it again			0
ditto for spray formulas : hold the nozzle close to your skin and spray , moving slowly up and down until you see a sheen , then go back over the area			2
for your face , apply a pea - size drop to each cheek , your forehead and your chin , then smear in			0
repeat ! @entity11 : sun - proof your skin from a to z do n't forget your nose it 's the number one sunburn - spot , dermatologists say			2
" people apply sunscreen to their face , but either skip or speed over their nose -- especially if they wear glasses , because they do n't want to take them off , " @entity89 says			0
@entity20 adds , " 80 % of the skin cancers i remove are on the nose			1
" other commonly missed areas include the feet , hair part , ears and chest , as well as the backs of hands and legs			0
use a sunscreen stick to spot - apply			0
get antioxidant insurance since rays can still get through sunscreen , companies are now including antioxidants such as vitamins c and @entity166 and green tea to help mitigate damage			1
if you do n't want to bother applying a serum that contains them beneath your moisturizer or sunscreen ( @entity89 's first choice ) , try a souped - up @entity49 pick			1
realize that sunscreen is only one part of a sun - smart plan " the hierarchy of sun protection should be avoidance first , then seek shade and wear a wide - brim hat and protective clothing , then use sunscreen -- but most people have that sequence backward , " @entity89 points out			1
consider hitting the beach or pool in the morning instead of midday ( when sun is strongest ) , and bring an umbrella and a tightly woven long - sleeve shirt			0
know that it 's never too late to start safe habits so you baked in the sun as a teen with little or no sunscreen			0
while regular tanning or getting several bad burns when you 're young raises your risk of skin cancer , @entity20 says , what 's critical is that you put on sunscreen these days			1
" since skin 's ability to repair itself decreases with age , your risk is even greater if you burn now			0
