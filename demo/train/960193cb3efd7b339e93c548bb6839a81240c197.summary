" the rhetoric , charges and counter-charges flew fast and thick tuesday as the presidential election campaign continued on its sharply negative trajectory			1
new advertisements by each side prompted caustic responses from the other as name - calling and finger - pointing dominated the debate less than three months before the november vote that pits president @entity17 against certain @entity19 nominee @entity18			1
a day after @entity17 coined the phrase " @entity21 " to describe policies by @entity18 that @entity17 said tax the poor to help the rich -- or @entity24 in reverse -- @entity18 fired back by creating his own word -- @entity3 -- to accuse the president of making things up			1
" he is serving up a dish that is in contradiction to the truth , " @entity18 told @entity29			2
meanwhile , a @entity18 ad that began airing tuesday accused @entity17 of seeking to undermine work requirements in a bipartisan welfare reform law signed by president @entity36 in 1996			1
@entity38 spokesman @entity37 rejected the claim , telling reporters that the ad was " categorically false " and " blatantly dishonest			1
" " this administration 's policy will strengthen the ( welfare ) program by giving states the opportunity to employ more effective ways , " @entity37 said			0
learning from @entity49 following a weekend imbroglio over senate majority leader @entity53 's claim that a former @entity18 associate told him @entity18 paid no taxes in past years , the campaign has veered into a political mud pile that emphasizes dirtying the opponent first			1
the tactics are part of the big - picture efforts by both sides to frame the election in terms favorable to their man			2
for @entity18 , that means portraying @entity17 as a failed president unworthy of a second term			1
for @entity17 , that means depicting the former @entity70 governor as a champion of the wealthy class and special interests			2
@entity53 's unsubstantiated claim , based on an unidentified source , was intended to keep alive the push by @entity77 to force @entity18 to release more of his past tax returns than the two years disclosed so far -- his 2010 filing and an estimate for 2011			2
@entity18 says he will make public the final version of last year 's return			2
@entity77 know that whatever any additional returns show , they can highlight the details of tax breaks and other accounting maneuvers by the multimillionaire @entity18 to bolster the perception they seek to exploit that he represents society 's fat cats			2
republicans responded by attacking @entity53 's credibility , and by extension , the president 's also			0
@entity53 's tax attack puts @entity19 in a bind @entity18 called on @entity53 to disclose his source or shut up , insisting he paid lots of taxes in past years , while top party spokesmen and surrogates called @entity53 a liar and said he was carrying out the attack at the request of the @entity38			1
@entity17 advisers , benefiting from the continued focus on the matter , denied they were behind @entity53 's push			2
" there is a way to resolve this dispute ... which is for the governor to follow a tradition that was established by his own father many years ago of presidential candidates releasing multiple years of his tax return , " @entity38 spokesman @entity37 chimed in tuesday			2
@entity37 referred to the decision by @entity120 , the former @entity121 governor who released 12 years of his tax returns when running for president in 1968			0
@entity18 says he has complied with the law and wo n't release any further returns that would only get distorted by @entity77 attackers			2
why political conventions still matter earlier tuesday , a @entity18 ad on welfare changes by the @entity17 administration claimed they would " gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements			1
" " under @entity17 's plan , you would n't have to work and would n't have to train for a job			2
they just send you your welfare check , " the announcer says			0
" and welfare - to - work goes back to being plain old welfare			0
" the changes , which would allow states greater flexibility in administering their welfare - to - work programs , were in a directive issued last month by the @entity147			0
at the time , some @entity19 claimed the new rules amounted to a " gutting " of work requirements for welfare recipients , which were a central element of the bipartisan welfare reform law signed by president @entity36 in 1996			1
the fact - checking website @entity156 said tuesday that the @entity18 ad distorted the intent of the welfare changes and gave it its harshest ruling of " @entity162			1
" in addition , @entity36 issued a statement saying the @entity18 ad was wrong			1
@entity37 responded with unusually strong language at his daily briefing			0
" this advertisement is categorically false and it is blatantly dishonest , " @entity37 said			1
" this administration 's policy will strengthen the program by giving states the opportunity to employ more effective ways			0
" he also called @entity19 criticism of the changes " hypocrisy , " pointing to past support from @entity19 governors -- including @entity18 -- for waivers to the federal requirements			1
in addition , @entity37 said , @entity19 governors in @entity182 and @entity183 already are seeking waivers under the administration 's program			0
@entity17 's re-election campaign , meanwhile , accused @entity18 of " not telling the truth			1
" " the truth is that the president is giving states additional flexibility only if they move more people from welfare to work - not fewer , " @entity17 campaign spokeswoman @entity190 said in a statement			1
" ... by falsely attacking a policy that both he and his @entity19 allies have supported for years , @entity18 is once again flip - flopping on a position he took in @entity70 , and demonstrating that he lacks the core strength and principles the nation needs in a president			1
" @entity205 : who 's behind threat to cut defense ? @entity18 campaign policy director @entity209 insisted that @entity18 has remained consistent in supporting work requirements for welfare recipients			1
@entity209 's statement said that as @entity70 governor , " @entity18 vetoed efforts to weaken work requirements and he pressed repeatedly to instead strengthen them and bring them in line with federal standards			0
" also tuesday , a @entity219 supportive of @entity17 released a new ad tying @entity18 to the death of a former @entity223 's wife after her husband lost his job when the plant closed down			1
@entity18 's former private equity firm , @entity227 , acquired gst steel in 1993 , but the company went bankrupt in 2001 , two years after @entity18 ceased day - to - day oversight of @entity227			0
the ad by @entity232 features @entity233 , a former worker at the @entity235 - based steel plant , as he tells the story of how he lost health insurance benefits when the plant shuttered			0
he then says his wife passed away from cancer after that			0
@entity233 's wife died in 2006			0
" i do not think @entity18 realizes what he 's done to anyone , and furthermore i do not think @entity18 is concerned , " @entity233 says			0
voter id lawsuits could delay results @entity18 's campaign issued a harsh reaction			1
" president @entity17 's allies continue to use discredited and dishonest attacks in a contemptible effort to conceal the administration 's deplorable economic record , " @entity18 spokeswoman @entity250 said in a statement			1
expect more of the same			0
last week , @entity1 reported that @entity232 has reserved $ 30 million this fall for broadcast and cable time			0
and on tuesday , a major fiscal conservative group that has spent tens of millions of dollars on ads critical of @entity17 revealed it will spend at least $ 7 million for new spots starting wednesday in 11 battleground states : @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity182 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , and @entity274			0
@entity275 : let all @entity276 vote early @entity277 , which is partially funded by the influential @entity278 and @entity279 , said it will rotate different ads and messages over the next three weeks in the campaign that could cost as much as $ 27 million			0
the billionaire @entity279 brothers are high - profile figures in the @entity19 who support conservative and libertarian causes			0
backers of @entity277 , the pair of industrialists are expected to spend tens -- if not hundreds -- of millions on @entity19 causes this year			0
@entity1 's @entity291 , @entity292 , @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295 contributed to this report .			0

campaigns and supporters of president @entity17 , @entity18 trade caustic barbs
the @entity38 calls a @entity19 ad on welfare changes " blatantly dishonest "
the @entity18 campaign calls an @entity219 ad " discredited and dishonest "
with the election less than three months away , both sides are *buying* more ad time
