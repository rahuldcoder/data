search teams had been looking for her since sunday			0
@entity16 is about 250 miles south of @entity20 , @entity1 , which has experienced some of the worst flooding seen in decades			1
friday , parts of @entity20 were under several feet of water after heavy rainfall the night before			2

by tuesday , the flood waters had receded and the clean - up and damage assessment was well under way			2
but rain was still falling over the entire region , raising fears of further flooding in some areas			2

also shut were eight footbridges , which are an essential means of connecting residents in riverside towns			0
in @entity60 , where @entity48 police constable @entity61 died in the floods last week , the two sides of the town are cut off from each other because all bridges were either washed away or closed for safety reasons			1

" we have n't yet confirmed what we 're going to do or when that 's going to happen , but in all likelihood we 're looking at a single - lane temporary bridge with traffic lights on either side			0
