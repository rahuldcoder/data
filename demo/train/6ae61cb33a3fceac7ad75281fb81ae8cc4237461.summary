@entity0 reasserted his innocence tuesday as his attorneys continued to distance him from his ex-girlfriend @entity3			1
" this has been a real tragedy , " he said			1
" i 'm not a criminal			0
" @entity0 's new defense strategy comes as their legal teams prepare to appeal the couple 's murder convictions in the death of @entity15 's former roommate @entity13 before @entity17 's @entity16 next year			1
it 's a dramatic departure from the past seven years , where the tactic has been to " stick together " and be " tried " together			1
@entity0 attorney @entity20 said that approach no longer works			2
" they are not @entity23 -- one body with two heads , " she said			0
the old approach began to change shortly after an @entity17 appeals court sentenced @entity0 to 25 years in prison and @entity15 to 28 years in january , and that change continued tuesday			1
@entity15 found guilty of murder again by @entity17 court new tactics @entity0 's lawyer @entity33 started laying the groundwork in february			1
" it 's imperative that the @entity17 courts consider @entity0 's case separate from @entity3 's case , " he said			1
" by necessity , he has to distance himself and his case from @entity3 and her case			0
" in a @entity43 interview at the time , @entity0 followed his attorney 's lead			1
though he said that the evidence clears them both , he used more selective language			0
" there is nothing against me and nothing very strong against @entity3 , " @entity0 said			2
" and in my case , i really did nothing wrong , and i do n't want to pay for someone else 's peculiar behavior			0
" in a note on her @entity59 page in february , @entity15 acknowledged @entity0 's new stance and appeared to back it up			1
she said he 's a scapegoat			0
" the only reason he has been dragged into this is because he happens to be my alibi , " she wrote			0
raising questions @entity15 's behavior on the morning @entity69 was found stabbed to death in the apartment she and @entity15 shared seems to be a new wrinkle in the @entity0 defense			1
that was early november 2007 , and he and @entity15 had been dating for only a week			2
@entity0 expanded on his doubts in an interview with @entity17 television that also aired on @entity79			1
@entity15 had spent the night with him but went back to her place to shower , he said			2
when she returned , she was " very agitated , " he said			0
she told him that it looked like someone had broken in and that there was blood in the bathroom , @entity0 said			2
but rather than call police , she showered and returned to his place			0
he finds it odd , he said			0
" certainly i asked her questions , " he said			0
" why did you take a shower ? why did she spend so much time there ? " he did n't get any real answers from her , he said in the interview			0
" i 'm not saying that @entity3 is responsible for all this situation , but they focus on her and they accuse her all the time , but i have nothing to do with all these circumstances and all these accusations , " @entity0 said			2
tuesday 's news conference in @entity109 was a profile in contrasts			0
at one point , @entity0 called into question @entity15 's version of events on the morning @entity69 was found stabbed to death , saying it was " imagination and hallucination			1
" yet , a few minutes later , he added , " @entity3 and i still believe she is innocent			0
" there are some anomalies , @entity20 said , but the legal team hopes that @entity17 's high court will rule in their favor by " annulling the sentence in full			1
" long - running case since @entity69 's death , @entity15 and @entity0 have gone through a legal odyssey that led to a conviction in 2009 that was overturned , followed by a second conviction in january			1
@entity15 is now living in the @entity130			2
another man , drifter and drug dealer @entity13 from the @entity134 , is serving 16 years for @entity69 's murder			1
he was tried separately from @entity15 and @entity136			0
he admitted having sex with the young @entity139 woman but said someone else killed her while he was in the bathroom .			0

" this has been a real tragedy , " @entity0 says
@entity0 's legal team lays the groundwork for an appeal in his murder conviction
an @entity17 appeals court sentenced him to 25 years in prison , @entity15 to 28
they were convicted in the death of @entity15 's former roommate @entity13
