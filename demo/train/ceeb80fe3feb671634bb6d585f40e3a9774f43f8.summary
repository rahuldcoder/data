@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the single deadliest loss for @entity7 troops since the @entity1 war began in late 2001 , 30 service members died early saturday when a helicopter carrying them went down while they were reinforcing other troops , officials said			1
insurgents are believed to have shot down the @entity13 , a @entity7 military official said			1
the @entity14 claimed militants downed the helicopter with a rocket - propelled grenade			1
among the 25 @entity7 special operations forces killed in @entity18 were 22 @entity19 , considered to be the " best of the best			1
" seven @entity1 troops also died			2
the majority of the @entity19 who died belonged to the same covert unit that conducted the raid that killed @entity27 in may , though they were not the same men , the military official said			1
the troops died during a " quick reaction " mission to assist military personnel pinned down by insurgents in a fierce firefight , a @entity7 military official told @entity2			1
" it 's a big loss " for the @entity19 , one of the officials said			1
" the numbers are high			2
" reflecting on the sobering loss , president @entity41 said the deaths were " a reminder of the extraordinary sacrifices made by the men and women of our military and their families , including all who have served in @entity1			1
" @entity53 's @entity52 said 30 @entity7 service members in @entity52 , one civilian interpreter and seven @entity1 commandos were killed			1

" he said ' i 'm not afraid			2
because i know where i am going if something happens to me			2
' " " he is with the @entity78 now , " she said			2
" i will see him again someday			2
" the @entity7 deaths came as @entity53 is drawing down and handing over security control to national forces			1
some 10,000 @entity7 troops are scheduled to depart by year 's end , with the full draw - down expected to take place by the end of 2014			1
however , no one is talking about withdrawing special operations forces and they are expected to stay on the job			2
" we are determined to stay the course , especially in this crucial period when @entity1 and international security forces are working closer than ever to make transition a success , " @entity53 secretary - general @entity92 said			2
special operations forces have been conducting almost daily night - time raids against insurgent targets in rugged areas like @entity18			2
the @entity13 went down as an @entity1 and coalition force operation targeted a bomb - making cell leader in @entity18 , leading to the detention of numerous insurgents friday , according to @entity52			2
it is not clear if the helicopter incident and the raid were connected			1
@entity111 , head of the provincial council , said @entity114 village elders reported that insurgents shot at the craft when it was returning from an operation			0
officials are being especially tight - lipped because recovery operations at the site are still underway and body identifications and family notifications are just beginning , a @entity7 military official said			1
@entity52 has not said how the incident occurred			0
spokesman @entity126 acknowledged the helicopter had been flying in an area where there was reported insurgent activity			1
" no words describe the sorrow we feel in the wake of this tragic loss , " said gen. @entity131 , @entity52 commander			1
" all of those killed in this operation were true heroes who had already given so much in the defense of freedom			1
their sacrifice will not be forgotten			0
our thoughts and prayers are with the families who are now waiting for their loved ones to return home			0
we will do everything in our power to support them in this time of need			0
" the @entity7 @entity152 in @entity0 , which said the helicopter went down friday evening , said @entity52 " is still assessing the circumstances that resulted in these deaths			1
" @entity157 spokesman @entity156 said it 's too early to say if the @entity14 caused the crash			0
he called for an investigation			0
@entity1 president @entity161 , @entity41 and others offered condolences			0
" information is still coming in about this incident			0
i think it 's important that we allow investigators to do their work before jumping to too many conclusions , " said adm. @entity166 , chairman of the @entity167			0
" it 's also important that we respect the process of notifying family members , no matter how long that takes			0
we ought to remember that the troops we lose in this war are n't just statistics or numbers on a wall			0
they were parents and siblings , and someone 's child			0
we need to make sure we do all we can to comfort and support the families whose lives are now forever changed			0
" @entity41 was first notified of the incident shortly after 8 p.m. friday , a @entity189 official told @entity2			1
the president led a telephone briefing midmorning saturday			0
the @entity13 is the workhorse helicopter of the @entity193 , used for decades to haul large numbers of troops and quantities of equipment			1
the military is looking into whether the helicopter was vulnerable to being shot down			1
depending on the configuration , the tandem - rotor @entity13 can carry 33 to 55 troops , plus two pilots on the flight deck , according to @entity205			0
it is capable of speeds up to 159 mph			0
the front rotor turns counter-clockwise while the rear rotor turns clockwise			0
the @entity19 , and other special operations forces , are given dangerous missions and go after insurgents in remote areas			1
a huge amount of money , training and expertise is poured into their careers			0
along with carrying out counter-terrorism assaults on the @entity1 - @entity222 border , they conduct training and military missions around the world			1
the @entity1 street is buzzing with reflection about the significance of the incident			0
" it shows that the @entity14 are very strong and have not been defeated by the @entity7 , " said @entity0 resident @entity230			1
but others said the incident is not emblematic of a new - found insurgent strength			0
" the @entity14 are not that powerful , " said @entity234 , a police officer in @entity0 who goes only by one name			0
" but if the international forces leave @entity1 , the situation will get even worse			0
" last month , a @entity53 helicopter was brought down by insurgent fire in the country 's eastern province of @entity242			1
the @entity14 also claimed responsibility for that attack , though no injuries were reported			0
in a separate incident , a @entity53 service member died saturday after an improvised explosive device detonated in southern @entity1			0
elsewhere , a joint @entity1 and coalition force conducted raids in the eastern province of @entity252 , killing " several insurgents , " @entity53 reported			0
the operation also targeted a " @entity14 facilitator , " who @entity53 said was responsible for supplying ammunition and bomb - making materials to the @entity14			0
in july , a series of gun battles in @entity252 between insurgents and @entity53 forces left at least 10 militants dead			2
there are 150,000 @entity52 forces in @entity1 , including nearly 100,000 from the @entity7 -- the largest @entity53 presence in the region since the @entity7 - led war began in 2001			1
@entity270 reported from @entity0 , @entity1 , and @entity271 and @entity272 reported from @entity273 .			0
