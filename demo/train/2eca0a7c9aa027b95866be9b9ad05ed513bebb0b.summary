@entity0 -- is the @entity2 the " greatest country on earth " ? you hear that a lot , or phrases like that , during this presidential campaign			1
candidates may attack other candidates , or the sitting president , but they never attack the idea that @entity2 is special , a " city upon a hill			1
" " the last , best hope of @entity16			0
" it 's part of @entity2 's ideology and its tradition of political rhetoric			1
to many @entity2 ' ears , it sounds normal			0
but to citizens of other countries it 's sometimes jarring , as if @entity2 put their country ahead of any other , as if the @entity2 thinks it has the right to tell the rest of the world what to do			1
we went to the @entity32 in @entity0 and asked visitors if they agree @entity2 " knows best " and the @entity2 has an obligation to spread its values around the world			0
almost everyone we talked with did not agree			0
@entity38 , a teacher with a @entity0 non-governmental organization , said : " i have a lot of pride in our government however , at the same time , it is ours and i do n't think that it is right to force it on other people			0
" @entity47 , from @entity48 , said he thinks the @entity2 is a special country , " the most powerful nation on earth and the most beautiful country on earth , in my mind			1
" but , he told us " it might not be the same model that everybody should be using			0
" they 're not the exception , it turns out			0
in their book , " @entity68 , " @entity60 president @entity59 and journalist @entity61 say it 's more often @entity2 leaders who want to impose @entity2 values in other countries -- not the @entity2 people			1
the authors analyzed international surveys of people around the globe going back to the 1980 's as well as more than 100,000 interviews in 60 countries			2
their conclusion ? " contrary to widespread misconceptions , @entity2 ' pride in their country is not evangelistic			1
the @entity2 people , as opposed to some of their leaders , seek no converts to their ideology			0
" citizens of many other countries , too , may think their national way of life is the best but , these authors say , " they do n't dominate the globe			2
" @entity2 may not be that different from others but the differences that do exist are magnified , fueling resentment around the world			2

" *u.s.a.* the special " is a *staple* of political rhetoric
authors find citizens are proud but not evangelistic about the country
view is similar to citizens of other countries but it 's magnified by @entity2 power
