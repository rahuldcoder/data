" @entity6 " was a way to raise money to fight a famine in @entity24 and other parts of @entity26 , following in the harmonious path blazed by @entity29 's " @entity28 ? " the single , credited to @entity31 , sold more than 20 million copies and topped the charts for four weeks in april and may			1
