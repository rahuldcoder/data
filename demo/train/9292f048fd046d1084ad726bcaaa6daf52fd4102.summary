@entity0 , @entity1 -- the mini-civil war that we 've seen play out in the @entity5 over the past few weeks is n't just a case of a dispute about tactics			1
it 's a sign of a deeper division			0
former president @entity11 , who has been campaigning for president @entity12 and taking on the @entity13 , went off - script several times			1
soon after @entity12 rolled out his ads attacking @entity16 for his work at @entity18 and then as @entity20 governor , @entity11 took issue with these kinds of attacks and extolled @entity16 's " sterling business career			1
" a few days later , @entity11 called for a temporary extension of president @entity27 's tax cuts , including those for the wealthy , and then on thursday said he was sorry for doing so			1
video : is @entity11 undermining @entity12 ? at some levels , the contrast in the views of @entity12 and @entity11 is yet another chapter in the extraordinarily tense personal relations that began with the 2008 @entity5 primaries , when then - sen. @entity36 competed with @entity12			1
when some of @entity12 's supporters charged that @entity11 was subtly playing on racial tensions in the @entity43 primary to stir up white voters , the anger between the two camps intensified			1
but at another level , the debate between these two men is part of a bigger debate about what kind of campaign the @entity5 should run : a campaign of articulation or a campaign of triangulation			1
what is @entity11 up to ? the party is reaching a crossroads			2
with the economy in poor shape and most polls showing that this is an extremely close race , @entity5 need to make some decisions about the basic themes they will develop in the next few months to define the fall contest			1
one strategy , which has been the preference thus far for president @entity12 , is a campaign of " articulation , " a campaign in which a candidate lays out a clear set of themes and ideas to distinguish himself from the opposition			2
this kind of campaign takes the offensive , touting the virtues of @entity5 ideas and policies			2
@entity5 have mostly avoided this approach in recent decades , still snake - bitten from the defeats in the @entity84 of the 1980s			1
it is the kind of campaign that @entity87 ran in 1936 , when he pushed back against conservatives and boasted about what @entity5 programs had done to save middle - class @entity91 in the middle of the @entity94			2
it is a campaign like that of 1964 , when @entity97 painted @entity98 as an extremist and championed programs like the @entity101 as shining examples of what the @entity5 offered in contrast			0
on the other side of the aisle , @entity105 ran this kind of campaign in 1980 , when he stood by the ideals of conservatism , insisting that the right offered a better path forward for a broken nation			0
the other kind of campaign , the campaign of " triangulation , " is one that @entity11 mastered in 1996			0
triangulation is a term popularized by @entity11 adviser @entity121 to describe a politician who stands above traditional left - right divisions and co-opts the arguments of the opposition			0
" the essence of triangulation is to use your party 's solutions to solve the other side 's problems , " he said , " use your tools to fix their car			0
" this was the kind of campaign @entity12 has always promised voters he would not run			1
the campaign of triangulation seeks to lessen the policy space between the two parties by minimizing many key differences and focusing voter attention on the personality and appeal of the candidate			0
@entity147 was one of the democrats who mastered this strategy			0
in 1976 , he sidestepped some traditionally controversial issues such as civil rights and economic policy and instead depicted himself as a deficit - cutting moderate who was not like his elders in the @entity5			0
he focused on his personality , his background in @entity158 and the argument that voters in the @entity162 age could trust him			0
in 1996 , @entity11 perfected this kind of campaign			0
after @entity13 had retaken the @entity164 and @entity165 in 1994 , @entity11 started the year of 1996 by saying the era of big government was over			1
he agreed to legislation that ended the existing welfare system and made deficit reduction his priority			0
in essence , he stole the mainstream part of the @entity13 agenda and made it his own			0
by the time the campaign was fully under way , he could concentrate on his youth and charisma , particularly when he compared himself with the much older @entity180 sen. @entity180 and highlight the areas that made the @entity13 look extreme , like their push for dramatic cuts in the @entity185 program			0
the strong temptation for @entity12 will be to move closer toward the model of triangulation , especially given the stalling economy and after @entity13 scored a major victory in @entity193 gov. @entity192 's recall campaign			1
@entity12 understands that the danger of a campaign of articulation is that he would not be able to capitalize on the issues that convince many moderates to go to or stick with the @entity13			1
but @entity12 needs to offer voters a choice			1
the danger of triangulation is that it dampens the enthusiasm of base supporters who are needed to help raise money and bring out the vote			0
they are the organizers , the mobilizers and the rank - and - file who can make sure that in a close election , more @entity5 come out to vote			2
and a candidate who ca n't triangulate as skillfully as @entity11 did could only end up legitimating the arguments of his opponent and leaving voters to wonder why they do n't just go for the " real thing			2
" this does not mean @entity12 has to run as a " left - wing " @entity217 , nor does he have to stick to attacks on @entity18 , which do n't seem to be working			2
but he does need a message , and he does need a coherent theme that goes beyond slight differences with the @entity13			2
@entity12 's best bet is to stick with a campaign in which he focuses on defining a @entity5 set of principles and offering voters a reason why his party would be better over the next four years , especially on the economy			1
if he does not , and he takes the triangulation bait , @entity12 could end up becoming a surrogate for the @entity16 campaign			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			0

@entity236 : @entity11 won *re-election* by *blurring* differences with @entity13
he says @entity12 is trying to win by articulating what the @entity5 stand for
@entity236 : @entity11 's approach would run the risk of helping @entity16 make his case
he says @entity12 needs to offer voters a choice and *energize* @entity5 ' base voters
