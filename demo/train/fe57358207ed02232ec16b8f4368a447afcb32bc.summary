-- my interest in the traditional @entity5 - @entity4 meal served in celebration of @entity7 began when i was a schoolgirl living on @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
@entity0 : 15 kitchen shortcuts that will change the way you cook our street was populated by a diverse assortment of families			2
there were @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 and other @entity22			0
there were @entity24 , @entity5 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity28 homeowners			1
this diversity contributed to my interest in understanding how people of different religions and nationalities celebrated holidays and rites of passage			0
@entity36 was also very interested in all holidays and was always looking to expand her cooking repertoire			0
the @entity39 were a large @entity5 family ( there were six kids , with whom we all felt a kinship ) who lived across the street			1
i loved visiting my friend @entity46 , the eldest daughter , in their stark , almost empty kitchen ( a contrast to our cozy and very busy one )			0
a favorite snack after school was a perfect baked potato snitched from under the aluminum dome of the stove - top roaster where mrs. @entity55 cooked her family 's daily potatoes			1
@entity0 : 19 tips for perfect laundry every time the first time i tasted the @entity7 feast at the @entity39 , i ran home and begged my mother to cook the exact same menu -- @entity5 soda bread with salted butter , corned brisket of beef simmered with big , round boiling potatoes , huge wedges of winter cabbage , giant bright - orange carrots , and chunks of pale - orange rutabagas , served with freshly grated horseradish and spicy yellow mustard			1
we went to the @entity78 and purchased a big corned brisket and all the fixings			2
the brisket was corned by the store 's butcher			2
he had his own recipe for brining the meat in a large crock in the back of the store			0
@entity0 : 20 super-efficient , super-effective ways to clean all the things the word corned had nothing to do with the vegetable , the butcher told us , but rather with the large kernel - size pieces of salt that customarily went into the brine			0
the butcher also gave us tips on how to cook it : rinsing the brisket , boiling it , draining it , and then simmering the beef slowly , until tender			2
the vegetables were cooked separately , some in the simmering liquid , and the potatoes and turnips in their own pots of fresh , salted water			0
@entity112 made a great soda bread , filled with caraway seeds and currants			1
@entity0 : instant organization : get it together in 15 minutes or less for years after that , we always celebrated @entity7 with a big traditional feast			1
my sister @entity121 always makes it for her family , adding parsnips			0
my friend @entity126 , in @entity127 , @entity128 , and her husband , @entity129 , actually turned me on to corning my own beef			0
the soda bread is a delicious , crumbly version i created one morning when i had few ingredients in my larder and needed to make several loaves for the @entity5 in my life			1
@entity0 : do n't shelve these clever bookshelf decorating ideas @entity138 just has to have soda bread and @entity5 butter on @entity7 , as does @entity141 , my new assistant , who also plays the bagpipes and drinks @entity144 dyed green			1
my hairdresser and makeup artist , @entity145 , loves @entity148 sandwiches made from her mother 's leftover corned beef			1
@entity138 always brings out his shamrock - bedecked handkerchiefs , ties , boutonniere , table linens , and bedding for @entity7			2
@entity0 : curb your food cravings with yoga			0
