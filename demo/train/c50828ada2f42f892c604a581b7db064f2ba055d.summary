-- already dubbed a horse racing " rock star , " @entity2 's owners are laying plans to maximize the thoroughbred 's rising profile ahead of the colt 's bid to win the @entity10 and the @entity11			1
having won the @entity12 and @entity13 -- the other two legs of the @entity11 -- @entity2 would become the first horse since affirmed in 1978 to achieve the ultimate feat in thoroughbred racing should he triumph in @entity19 next month			1
owners @entity20 and @entity22 and their wives @entity23 and @entity25 , have registered the name with the @entity27 , according to records filed on thursday may 15			0
the move will give the owners license to use the name " @entity2 " on athletic apparel including shirts , pants , jackets , footwear , hats and caps			1
the three - year - old colt is arguably rapidly becoming the biggest racing sensation since the retirements of @entity42 and @entity43			0
@entity42 , who retired undefeated after winning all 14 of his races in october 2012 , was estimated to be worth $ 168 million			0
@entity43 , the mare who dominated @entity48 racing , retired in april 2013 after 25 consecutive victories and amassing nearly eight million dollars in prize money			0
she was featured on the front page of @entity48 @entity54 magazine and was even voted as the country 's top sportswoman			0
only 11 of the 38 horses who have won the @entity12 and the @entity13 have gone on to complete the dream treble with victory at the @entity10			2
the colt coasted to victory in @entity63 last saturday to win the 139th @entity13 -- and is now favourite for victory in the $ 1.5 million race in @entity19 on june 7			1
@entity2 was born to a mare named @entity68 , purchased by @entity23 and @entity22 for $ 8,000 with a view to breeding			2
she was bred to the stallion @entity72 for a reduced fee of $ 2,000 , the first breeding the novice pair had ever undertaken			0
their offspring had earned @entity23 and @entity22 more than $ 2.3 million in prize money before the @entity13 , also chalking up wins at the @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81			2
after its @entity13 success @entity2 became front page news after @entity19 racing officials decided to allow the three - year - old to wear a breathing strip during the @entity10			1
his owners might not have allowed him to race without a strip , which the manufacturer says allows horses to breathe more freely and reduces the risk of bleeding in the lungs during heavy exertion			0
@entity2 has worn the strips during his last six wins , including those first - place finishes at the @entity12 and @entity13 .			1
