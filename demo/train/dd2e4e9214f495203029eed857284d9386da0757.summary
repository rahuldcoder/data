" the convicted felon connected to a loan sharking ring is @entity39 , who donated $ 6,100 to @entity2 between 2010 and 2014 , and was recently sentenced to four years in prison			1
a @entity2 spokeswoman said the congressman has given back or donated those contributions -- most of them years ago			1
" down in all recent polls and relying on d - list cultural references , @entity48 's @entity3 campaign has officially jumped the shark , " @entity2 spokeswoman @entity45 said of the ad			1

on a map otherwise ripe with @entity54 pick - up opportunities , the race in @entity60 -- which in presidential elections is a key swing state -- has remained outside of @entity54 ' grasp			2
@entity65 ' polling average shows @entity2 with a nine percentage point advantage over @entity48 , who has struggled with local media and has n't been able to overcome @entity69 ' efforts to latch her to the conservative @entity72 brothers			0
" consider this just the latest in failed gimmicks from @entity76 that do nothing to distract from the fact that she is out of touch with @entity60 's middle class , " @entity73 said			0
