-- a wave of anger over austerity is sweeping across @entity4 as workers fed up with government spending cuts and tax increases took to the streets in a coordinated day of action wednesday			1
some of the largest and occasionally violent protests took place in @entity12 , where a general strike is under way			1
public transport has been shut down , or disrupted , while many schools , shops , factories and airports are closed			1
there were also significant walkouts -- and outbreaks of violence -- in @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			1
limited protests are taking place in other countries , including @entity30 and @entity31 -- and even in @entity33 where the traditionally strong economy has taken a hit			1
transport across the continent is being disrupted by the strikes			1
hundreds of flights have been grounded , and there are severe reductions in intercity rail services and local transit systems			1
protesters say the cuts will compromise livelihoods and increase unemployment			1

@entity82 , from the @entity84 union explained why it was important for workers to support the action			1
" the cuts are n't limited to @entity12			1
they are happening in the whole @entity90			0
" that 's why it is important that all @entity4 protest against these cuts and against this way to do politics			1
" but despite the recent violent social unrest and the rise of suicides blamed on increasing financial hardship the government is sticking to its fiscal plan			2
@entity12 pm @entity101 said : " i said i would lower taxes , but i am raising them , i have n't changed my criteria nor will i decline to put them down when possible , but circumstances have changed and i must adapt to them			1
" it 's a similar picture in neighboring @entity24 where protesters are taking part in what they 're calling a " coordinated day of action			1
" @entity24 's main trade unions say the protests are meant to show mass discontent and send @entity4 leaders a warning			1
months of quiet resignation in the country have turned to anger and discontent			0
a combination of severe tax increases -- and rising unemployment -- have made social unrest the norm			2
unemployed @entity127 explained the reason for the unrest			0
" you see people participating in demonstrations more and more			2
the social awareness is noticeable			0
this year we had more demonstrations than in the last 20 years ! " on monday several hundred people took to the streets as @entity33 chancellor @entity138 visited the @entity24 capital to rally morale			1
many held banners saying : " @entity138 , you 're not welcome			0
" in @entity26 , clashes broke out in @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 with several police officers reported injured			1
the unions say the strike is designed not to damage the economy , but to show the scale of the opposition to austerity cuts			2
" this is a government that is destroying all the rights to social services with the excuse of the @entity90 , " said one demonstrator , @entity154			2
" we believe that the voice of the workers should finally be heard because they are the ones suffering			2
there have been a series of measures that are really bringing the people to ruin			2
" on monday , with youth unemployment approaching 35 % , 3,000 students vented their anger			0
" we are students and our future is at stake and we need to do something , " said one student called @entity173			0
" if we do n't do something , who will ? " @entity0 's @entity179 said the government must strike a fine balance between sometime violent domestic oppostion and its international debt obligations			2
" in elections next year we 'll see how successful the government was in achieving this balance			0
" in @entity25 , police said 5,000 people took to the streets to protest peacefully over the economic pain they are suffering			1
in the last two years alone public sector workers have seen their wages shrink by up to 40 %			2
unemployed civil servant @entity192 explained why she planned to join the protests			0
" i have two children , they 're twins , and the situation is tragic , " she told @entity0			0
" what i want to say to everyone is that they have to come onto the streets and shout so that these measures do not take place			0
" the @entity202 and the @entity90 are debating whether and when @entity25 can receive its next bailout payment			1
protesters , such as pensioner @entity205 , hope to remind them that they are the ones bearing the burden of austerity			0
" all these measures they are pushing us back 50 , 60 years , " he said			0
" they are cutting our pensions in half , there is a million unemployed , more taxes			0
in other words our lives are just getting worse and worse			0
" even in @entity33 there were protests , including 200 demonstrators in @entity224			2
@entity0 's @entity225 said that unions organized the protests more out of solidarity than real anger			0
however he added that the economy was slowing down and the eurozone crisis was taking its toll on the labor market			0
unemployment is lower than in other countries but trades unions warn that austerity measures could damage the economy			0
" @entity138 has become a lightning rod for protesters across @entity4 due to anger over her insistence that debt - ridden countries adopt austerity , " he said			0
