-- a year after the remains of a @entity6 toddler were discovered , a lawyer for the slain child 's mother asked a judge friday to stop prosecutors from seeking the death penalty against her			1
lawyer @entity11 told @entity13 circuit court judge @entity12 that the " real reason " prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against @entity19 is because they want to " get as biased a jury as they possibly can			1
" @entity11 said a jury that is qualified to serve in a death penalty case is more likely to convict defendants			1
but prosecutor @entity23 told the court that the state is not seeking the death penalty ; rather , the jury and judge will decide whether it is appropriate			1
@entity30 has pleaded not guilty to murder in the death of her 2 - year - old daughter , @entity19			1
the toddler 's skeletal remains were discovered december 11 , 2008 , six months after she disappeared			0
the remains were bagged and partially buried in a swampy , vacant lot , and duct tape covered the child 's mouth			0
@entity23 said the death penalty question is not for the prosecution to answer			2
" everyone who is indicted by a grand jury in the state of @entity6 for the crime of first - degree murder is eligible for the death penalty , " he said			1
" the decision by the prosecutor is simply , should a jury , and ultimately , a judge , be allowed to make this decision ? " further explaining why he believed the case was eligible for the death penalty , @entity23 speculated what jurors might infer from the facts presented to them			1
he suggested that @entity19 's killer may have either given the toddler a substance to knock her unconscious before applying duct tape to her mouth and nose , or had physically restrained her before doing so			0
" as the killer looked into her face , maybe her killer even saw her eyes , as the tape was applied , " he said			0
as he spoke , @entity30 sobbed , as her lawyer comforted her			0
@entity11 noted that there is " no evidence ... that this tape had anything to do with the death of this child			0
" police released documents this year showing they believed that @entity19 was slain within days of the time she was last seen and that her body was in the trunk of her mother 's car for " a period of time			1
" authorities have said that the cause of @entity19 's death is homicide by undetermined means			2
in her argument , the defense attorney noted the toddler 's undetermined manner of death , saying that the death penalty infringes on @entity30 's constitutional rights			1
" they can not be seeking the death penalty in good faith because there is insufficient evidence ... to establish first - degree murder , " she argued			2
earlier friday , @entity30 's lawyer also urged the judge to prohibit jail officials from videotaping sessions between her and her client , as well as visits from @entity30 's friends and family			2
she said that she has been told that the videos are for security and that the sound is disabled , but said that she and her client have the " feeling that perhaps we 're being listened to			0
" the judge said he would make his rulings as soon as possible			0
@entity30 's parents also appeared in the courtroom for friday 's hearing			0
in a may interview on @entity0 's " @entity123 , " @entity121 and @entity19 said they believed their daughter was innocent .			0
