-- they are always the last to understand			0
it 's weird , is n't it , the way our greatest cheaters and liars go so far and so hard in their efforts to win and dominate and overcome that , en route , they fail to see the inevitable downfall that awaits ? back in the early 2000s , when i was a baseball writer at @entity15 , @entity13 treated everyone — teammates , coaches , opponents , fans , writers — as if they were specks of crud beneath his ( regularly manicured ) fingernails			1
he camped out in front of a wall of four lockers , had his own clubhouse videographer , his own clubhouse physical therapist , his own perky publicists			0
he was the greatest home run hitter who ever lived : a slugger who , well into his late 30s , was bashing 450 - foot shots over the deepest of outfield walls			2
where is @entity13 today ? answer : who the hell cares ? his website is down			1
his cards can be had , straight up , in exchange for two @entity47 and a @entity48			0
he will never be hired to work in the game , as either a broadcaster or coach			0
his records — in the minds of most fans — do n't count			2
news : @entity57 banned from world @entity59 events over doping probe which leads us to @entity57			1
in case you missed the news , wednesday morning the @entity67 filed new charges against the seven - time @entity70 winner , threatening to strip the cycling legend of his triumphs			1
according to the agency , blood samples taken from @entity57 in 2009 and 2010 are " fully consistent with blood manipulation including @entity78 use and / or blood transfusions			1
" the agency also accuses @entity57 of using and promoting the use of @entity78 ( a blood booster ) , blood transfusions , testosterone , @entity85 and anti-inflammatory steroids			1
in an interview with @entity90 ' " @entity89 , " @entity87 , @entity57 's former teammate , said he witnessed the star using @entity78 on multiple occasions			1
@entity57 , of course , denies all the charges			1
i do n't believe him			0
he says he is clean and innocent -- just as @entity13 was clean and innocent , just as @entity96 and @entity97 and @entity98 and @entity99 and every other too - good - to - possibly - be - true athletic freak was clean and innocent , too			1
he is a victim of the media			0
a victim of sport inconsistencies			0
why , he 's passed 350 tests and , even if the testing system is a complete joke , well , hey , he passed			0
what @entity57 is allegedly doing -- what all athletes in his shoes seem to do — is beyond damaging			1
across the world , millions of people believe in @entity57 's narrative			1
they love his wins , yes , but what drives them and inspires them is the way he faced cancer and battled back from a near - death experience			2
@entity126 children in pediatric care have been relayed his story , have been told that one day , if you stay strong and fight and believe , you , too , can be just like @entity57			1
surely , somewhere along the way , @entity57 apparently convinced himself that there was no other way			2
as the common athletic thinking goes : if everyone else is cheating , i need to cheat , too			0
that logic , now pervasive throughout all levels of sport , has turned our athletic endeavors into fraudulent clown shows			0
for every @entity13 and @entity96 and @entity143 , there were clean ballplayers being robbed of their greatness			2
i 'll never forget a conversation i once had with @entity147 , a journeyman catcher who spent his nine - team , 11 - year big league career desperately trying to hold on to a job			2
we were chatting about all the catchers who were named in the @entity152 ; all the men who loaded up , then stole the positions he was battling for			0
" there 's an idea that everyone cheats , " @entity147 said			0
" well , i do n't , and i never have			0
for me , it 's about integrity			0
" like @entity13 , @entity57 is the last to know where he is headed			1
we are already beginning to speak of him as we do @entity165 and @entity166 and @entity167 on one of those " i love the ' 80s " shows			0
we 'll look back at his cycling reign and shrug , because it will be merely an illusion , an ugly period when people cheated to win , then faced a lifetime of banishment			2
news : @entity57 responds to agency 's doping allegations we will laugh			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

@entity183 : great sports cheaters are always the last to *anticipate* their downfall
one example : @entity13 was high - living , *inaccessible* , *felled* by a doping *scandal* , he says
he says @entity57 now charged in doping , could be stripped of cycling triumphs
@entity183 : @entity57 , others hurt fans , other athletes ; they are soon banished , forgotten
