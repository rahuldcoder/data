-- a @entity2 @entity1 completes a triple roll in the sky above the largest aerospace and defense show in @entity7			0
it 's followed with an aerial demonstration by the @entity11 @entity10 -- the world 's first production tilt - rotor aircraft			1
it can take off and land like a helicopter , but flies with the range , airspeed and payload of a fixed - wing airplane			0
inside the vast exhibition hall , trade visitors to the biennial @entity29 eye some of the latest global offerings in military technology such as unmanned aerial vehicles , anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare aircraft , fire control radars and infrared counter-measures			1
keen to demonstrate its supremacy in defense and aerospace technology , the @entity11 has more on display than any other country			1
" a lot of the bells and whistles , new avionics , and the 21st century equipment -- it all started as industry and showcasing their work , " says col. @entity36 , mission commander for the @entity11 military forces supporting the airshow			1
@entity48 's approach in the same exhibition hall , there 's a different approach from @entity48			1
@entity52 is known about the extent of @entity48 's military capabilities , and so when the country takes part in an airshow , as in @entity58 , it attracts attention			1
compared with more than 160 @entity11 military and commercial companies represented in @entity58 this week , @entity48 has 20 exhibitors			1
defense experts say any discussion of @entity48 's military capabilities needs to be centered around what 's not on display , rather than what is			1
the @entity11 defense budget is the highest in the world , with @entity70 estimating last year 's spending at $ 582.4 billion			1
but @entity48 's fast - growing economy has also allowed hefty increases in military spending			1
its defense budget of $ 139.2 billion for 2013 is the world 's second largest , according to @entity77 , which provides defense and security analysis			0
couple that with regional disputes escalating in @entity7 , including @entity48 's controversial declaration of an air defense identification zone ( @entity83 ) in the @entity84 -- and its increased assertiveness in the @entity86 -- and the country is increasingly seen as a major force			1
generals , ministers , bureaucrats at the @entity58 event , manufacturers rub shoulders with high - ranking generals , government ministers and defense bureaucrats from around the world , all eyeing potential deals			0
" no one wants this to be seen as an arms bazaar , but on the other hand , it 's a good opportunity to position your wares and explain where you fit into the broader strategic context , " says @entity101 , analyst of the @entity102 , which researches the aerospace and defense industry			0
the state - owned @entity114 ( @entity114 ) has one of the show 's largest stands out of the @entity48 exhibitors			2
@entity114 's core business is aviation defense -- models on display here include the l - 15 advanced jet trainer , the @entity126 fighter aircraft , an attack helicopter , and an unmanned combat aerial vehicle , the @entity129			0
competing with the @entity130 @entity48 is working hard to sell its aircraft overseas , says @entity132 , @entity7 bureau chief for @entity133			2
" they really want to sell the @entity135 -- that 's a big deal , " @entity132 says			0
" they 're looking at markets like @entity139 and @entity140 -- more affordable platforms that compete with the @entity130			0
" but @entity132 says @entity48 's models on display pale in comparison with those of the @entity11 " these are very simple platforms , including single engine fighters			1
they would n't last long against the @entity11 but they 're not worried about that			2
you know if they want to go up against the @entity11 they 'll use their air - to - air or surface - to - air missiles and knock out one of our fighter jets			2
" acrobatic displays missing from the @entity114 stand is a model of the fourth - generation , @entity48 - made j - 10 fighter , the multi-role combat aircraft which , some weeks ago , was expected to take part in the airshow 's aerobatic displays , but later inexplicably pulled out			2
at the airshow , the @entity11 is displaying a mock - up of its fifth - generation @entity171 , but the development of its @entity48 equivalents , the @entity167 and @entity168 stealth fighters , is shrouded in secrecy			1
" i think it 's less about hardware and more about just posturing , " says @entity101 , analyst of the @entity102 , which researches the aerospace and defense industry			0
" the @entity11 is extremely transparent , and the @entity180 tends to regard military capability as something you slowly develop and then you deploy			2
and if it comes to it , you use it			0
vision of warfare " @entity48 's deployment of prototypes speaks to a vision of warfare that 's completely different from the @entity180			1
" @entity191 , senior fellow from the @entity192 in @entity58 and global expert on the @entity48 military , agrees			2
" i think @entity48 has been able to think creatively about how they use what they do have			0
that 's why we 're worried about things like their cyber war capabilities or new types of weapons systems like an anti-ship ballistic missile , " @entity191 says			0
" it does n't have to be particularly cutting edge , high - tech , 22nd century stuff , but the fact that [ the @entity48 ] have it , and how they use it , are things that change the rules of the road			0
" when it comes to @entity48 , quantity has a quality all of its own , @entity191 says			0
military power is about how your equipment stacks up against your likely competitor , he adds .			0

@entity220 shows off latest in military technology
@entity48 's offerings attract special attention
@entity11 jets are considered superior , but @entity48 may not be displaying all it has
