when i read about the rape of a 23 - year - old photojournalist in @entity3 , i thought , here we go again			1
on december 6 , 1992 , when i was a 29 - year - old reporter covering the demolition of a mosque in northern @entity7 , i was attacked			0
i was n't raped , but my attackers sexually assaulted and then tried to kill me			2
someone dragged me to a trench outside the mosque and pulled my shirt off			0
but a passerby jumped in , fought off my attackers and saved me			0
when i appeared in court to testify against the attackers , their lawyers asked me questions that implied i was responsible			1
how could the daughter of a good family have gone to cover the demolition ? did i smoke ? what kind of clothes was i wearing ? did i believe in @entity22 ? the judge did not stop them			0
it was a demoralizing and toxic experience , but one that is not unknown to women in @entity7 who choose to speak out against sexual attacks			2
they are silenced by a process that heaps shame , fear and guilt on them			0
@entity7 women feel sorrow , anger at @entity39 student 's harassment in rural @entity41 in 1992 , a judge dismissed charges filed by a low - caste , or @entity44 , grassroots social worker , @entity46 , who said she was gang raped			2
she had been campaigning against child marriage			0
a judge said , " a middle - aged man from an @entity7 village could not possibly have participated in a gang rape in the presence of his own nephew			2
" a judgment like this not only deters other women from testifying against their rapists , it also emboldens the attackers , who know that they will get away with it			2
most women say they would never tell the police about an attack , afraid that they would be ignored or even abused by the cops themselves			1
keeping chivalry alive in @entity7 : men respond to rape crisis in june , 13 anti-rape protesters were arrested outside the home of the @entity74 chief minister and detained for more than eight hours			1
ironically , they were protesting the lack of police protection for women in the state following the rape and murder of a 20 - year - old college student whose body was found lying near a river near the outskirts of @entity85 , and that of a 14 - year - old girl who was raped and killed in the town of @entity88 , 90 miles away , only three days later			1
few women want to appear in court only to be stigmatized and traumatized -- unlike treatment of the suspects			1
while @entity7 's legal framework has improved for women over the past 20 years , the people implementing it are mostly male cops and lawyers who live in a deeply patriarchal society			1
incidents of rape have gone up by 873 % in @entity7 in the past 60 years			2
on average , each day , three @entity44 women are raped in some part of our country			2
the conviction rate for rape cases in 2011 was 25 % -- although some estimate only one in 10 rapes is reported			1
the conviction rate for men accused of raping @entity44 women is almost nil			1
the @entity114 's annual report of crime statistics also reports disturbing findings : a woman is raped somewhere in @entity7 every 20 minutes , and the number of children raped has increased by 336 % in the past 10 years			2
this culture of impunity is certainly one of the reasons rape has too often become the weapon of choice for frustrated young men who blame women , increasingly visible in the workplace , for their unemployment , and who hope to regain jobs by frightening women back home through sexual violence			1
the desire to blame women is fed by a cult of masculinity promoted by corporate and political leaders who serve as role models for the rest of society			1
harassment in @entity7 : ' the story you never wanted to hear ' in the course of my work with @entity150 , i have seen the steady creeping of a rape culture into the fabric of @entity7			1
we work to organize women in prostitution to resist their own and their daughters ' rape			1
the biggest challenge we face is the attitude of politicians , senior police officials , heads of foundations and even policy makers who view rape as a normal part of society			1
many have told me : " men will be men			0
" recently , when @entity114 pegged @entity74 as the state with the highest incidence of crimes against women , the chief minister contested the bureau 's statistics rather than tackling the problem			0
continually , budget allocations to the @entity183 are reduced			0
debates to ensure equal power sharing between the sexes through the @entity187 have gone nowhere			0
but no amount of violence and intimidation is going to force women back into their homes			0
in fact , homes are often the places where females are in the most danger -- from the time they are conceived to old age			0
an average @entity7 female could likely be a victim of foeticide , infanticide , malnourishment , dowry , child marriage , maternal mortality , domestic servitude , prostitution , rape , honor killings and domestic violence -- simply because she is female			0
equipped with better education , women are courageously taking their place in the public sphere as doctors , lawyers , journalists , bankers , politicians , farmers , teachers and more			2
they are signing up for social justice movements to end the growing inequality and unemployment in our country			0
as yet another gang - rape victim suffers in a @entity3 hospital in @entity7 , we have to recognize the need to overhaul the criminal justice system			1
in december 2012 , @entity7 and the world were shocked by the brutal gang rape and beating aboard a moving bus of a 23 - year - old physiotherapy intern , who later died of massive internal injuries			0
it prompted desperate calls for reform , protests and close examination of @entity7 's attitudes toward rape			0
but after the initial outrage , it seems that the law has only changed on paper			0
the rape in @entity3 might not have happened if the culture of rape was truly overcome and sexual assaults were taken seriously .			1

@entity253 says the rape of a photojournalist in @entity3 is not *surprising*
@entity253 : women do n't report rapes because they will be stigmatized and traumatized
when @entity253 appeared in court to report an attack , lawyers held her responsible
@entity253 : culture of rape is *ingrained* in *misogynistic* society where men in control do n't care
