-- @entity2 baguettes and pastries are n't the traditional bread of choice in the @entity6			0
but a bakery opened by a one of the region 's foremost gourmet food companies is aiming to change that			1
@entity12 firm , @entity11 , hopes that by providing an international flavor to their offerings they will be able to further entice customers to their branded stores and cafes across the @entity6			1
the group has certainly come a long way from its early days as a humble date producer			0
@entity11 first started manufacturing gourmet dates in 1992 , adding nuts and chocolate to the traditionally popular fruit and selling them in upmarket boutique stores			1
" at that time dates were being sold in supermarkets and souks , " said @entity11 ceo , @entity26			1
" but we decided that we wanted to market dates like @entity33 chocolates			2
" " we took essentially an agricultural product and turned it into a luxury food item and in the process created an entire new industry			2
" a little more than 20 years later and @entity11 is now operating in 17 countries with @entity12 and the @entity39 representing its biggest markets			1
drinks , oils and jams have also been added to its product repertoire during this time			0
" surprisingly , dates is not as big of a business for us ( any more ) , " said @entity26			2
" we are now a very much integrated premium food company			1
about 25 % to 30 % of our business comes from dates			2
" to help market its food products the company launched the @entity53 in 2007 , featuring its ingredients on the menu			1
it also carried on selling its goods through its shops and other outlets like hotels and airports			0
this carefully calculated strategy of diversification has paid dividends			0
" we just signed with @entity67 , the new terminal , so in a way the airport is an extension of our retail business , " @entity26 said			0
" in the ( @entity73 ) we are the number one food market here ... so there is a major presence			1
" @entity26 says @entity78 has seen 20 % to 30 % growth in the past five years			0
but he said that this is not enough for what he eventually envisions for the company			0
" outside the @entity6 , or outside the @entity83 , we are going on a franchise business , " he said			0
" i 'd like to see when you go to @entity86 , you say it 's time to go out and have a cup of coffee and you say ' oh , there 's a @entity78 here , let 's go to @entity11			2
' just as you do that in @entity93 or @entity94			0
" perhaps this is the next stage of the @entity11 story , transforming a homegrown @entity6 group into a truly global brand .			1
