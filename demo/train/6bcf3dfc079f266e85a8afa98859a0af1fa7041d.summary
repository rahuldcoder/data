-- fine @entity2 calligraphy and street art may seem worlds apart , but for artist @entity5 , they 're one and the same thing			1
@entity5 , a 31 - year - old @entity9 @entity8 artist , has just used his distinctive style of @entity2 street art , which he calls " calligraffiti , " to decorate the tallest minaret in @entity8 with a verse from the @entity14 that tackles intolerance			1
the mural , on the @entity17 in @entity5 's hometown of @entity19 is 47 meters tall , 10 meters wide and covers two sides of the minaret , his biggest artwork to date			1
@entity5 said he was reacting to clashes between hardline @entity24 and artists at an art fair in @entity27 in june that showed works the @entity24 believed was insulting to @entity29			1
@entity8 has experienced the resurgence of ultra-conservative @entity24 groups since since the revolution that ousted president @entity34 @entity33 in 2011			1
@entity5 said he believed both the artists and the religious extremists were showing intolerance and he wanted to bring a message of tolerance			1
" my goal was to bring people together , which is why i chose these words from the @entity14 , " said @entity5			1
" i like graffiti because it brings art to everyone			0
i like the fact of democratizing art. " i hope it will inspire other people to do crazy projects and not to be scared			0
" @entity5 , who was born and raised in @entity9 by a @entity8 family , grew up speaking @entity8 dialect			2
he did not learn to read or write @entity2 until his late teens and discovered a renewed interest in his @entity8 roots			2
he began experimenting with street art both in @entity9 and @entity8 at the age of 16 , and gradually increased the scale of his work			1
he said street art has boomed in @entity8 since the revolution			1
" street art is not new to @entity8 , but it was much more small scale before the revolution , " he said			1
" i would do a wall in a community and people in the neighborhood would come along and help me			0
" in the beginning i would work when no - one was around , but as i got more well - known , people would invite me to decorate their walls			0
" also on inside the @entity69 : @entity71 artists fight @entity73 regime with satire after the revolution in january 2011 , street art was possible on a bigger scale , he said			1
" before the revolution art in @entity8 was quite bourgeois , but if you put big pieces of art on walls it is for everyone , " said @entity5 , now living in @entity78 , @entity79			1
" the revolution pushed people to be more creative because before they were scared -- and now they have more freedom			0
" exactly a year after the start of the protests against president @entity33 which sparked uprisings across the @entity94 world , @entity5 took on his first large - scale mural to celebrate @entity8 's revolution			1
in the city of @entity98 , he painted a giant mural with a passage from a @entity8 poem he intended as a message of hope to all those engaged in struggles against tyranny , corruption , and injustice			2
the wall he used had been used during the revolution to voice dissent during the revolution , he said , adding that six others spontaneously joined him to help with the mural			0
@entity5 wrote on his website : " the wall on which we painted had actually been used to voice dissent and commentary throughout the protests			2
folks painted freely on this wall and would discuss current opinions and the changing state of @entity8			2
" this wall , however , was painted over not long after the ousting of @entity33 : those revolutionary words no longer able to conjure the memories of defiance and dignity			0
in this sense , the mural creation became a public memorial commemorating these words and their meaning			0
" also on inside the @entity69 : @entity137 hat happened to @entity139 's tent city ? for his recent projects , @entity5 worked with a community organization @entity141 , which obtained authorization for his murals			2
he was sponsored to do the minaret mural by @entity145 in the @entity146			0
in his earlier works , he simply asked people if he could paint on their walls			0
@entity5 chose his nickname as a tag for his grafitti at the age of 16 while studying a @entity9 novel " @entity155			2
" " my teacher said ' le cid ' comes from the @entity2 word ' el sayed ' which means ' the master , the man '			0
so i was 16 years old and i said to myself ' i am the master , the man ' so i called myself ' @entity5			0
