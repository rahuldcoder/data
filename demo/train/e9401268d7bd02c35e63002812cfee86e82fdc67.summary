@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 aviation agency agreed tuesday that global airline flight tracking is needed in the wake of @entity7 's disappearance and established a september deadline for " near - term implementation plans for applicable solutions			1
" @entity12 , president of the @entity4 's @entity13 , made the announcement after officials from more than 40 countries met in @entity0 to examine a framework for worldwide standards aimed at preventing similar mysteries			1
" @entity13 will continue to provide the necessary leadership to ensure all issues are considered expeditiously to enable a ' performance - based ' international standard for global airline flight tracking , " @entity12 said in a statement			1
" as @entity13 considers the requirements for global flight tracking , we will also be looking closely at the most effective means of sharing tracking data when needed with applicable search and rescue and accident investigation authorities , " he said			1
@entity7 has been missing since march 8 despite an international search			1
global flight tracking is not a new issue , but there is new urgency as the global aviation community looks closely at more robust flight tracking in response to the disappearance of the @entity41 commercial airliner carrying 239 people			1
" public perception is that in a world where every move seems to be tracked , there is disbelief both that an airplane could simply disappear and that the flight data and cockpit voice recorders could be so difficult to recover , " the @entity43 said in a submission to the meeting			1
@entity7 , a @entity55 , disappeared on a routine flight from @entity57 , @entity58 , to @entity59			1
its transponder went off and its maintenance reporting system stopped functioning			2
it lost contact over open waters between @entity58 and @entity65			1
radar is not reliable over the ocean or , as is possible in this case , at low altitudes			2
it 's unclear whether the transponder -- a radio transmitter in the cockpit that works with ground radar to identify a plane 's position , speed and direction -- and the maintenance reporting system , which transmits periodic flight data to the ground , were intentionally disabled or malfunctioned			1
the search for the plane is concentrated in the @entity84 off the coast of @entity86 , @entity87			2
damage to search vehicle meanwhile , the sole underwater vehicle searching for the plane was temporarily taken out of service because of damage , a @entity90 official told @entity2			0
the tail section of the @entity96 was badly damaged when it struck the side of the @entity87 vessel @entity98 in the last 24 hours			0
but the submersible has been repaired and probably will be redeployed when daylight arrives in the southern @entity84 , the @entity90 official said			0
the accident occurred when searchers , who were experiencing communications problems with the vessel , were hoisting the @entity96 to the deck to examine it , said @entity105 , deputy director of ocean engineering for the @entity90			0
" they had 20 - knot winds and 3 - to 5 - foot seas , " @entity105 said			0
" they got the vehicle on deck , but in the process of doing so , the vehicle was damaged			0
they essentially had torn the propeller , the tail section had ripped away , and so there was some damage back aft ( in the area of ) the main electronics bay			0
there were quite a few components that we had to troubleshoot			0
" the good news is the vehicle is repaired , " he added			0
@entity105 said the @entity96 was repaired with spare parts loaded on the @entity98 during its recent refueling trip to port			0
he said it is likely the team will wait until daylight before deploying the @entity96 on its next mission			0
the vessel is " probably more than halfway through " searching the location of " @entity137 , " considered the second most likely place to find the wreckage of flight 370			1
no wreckage was found during its search of " @entity143 , " considered the most likely location of the plane			0
during the mission in which it was damaged , the @entity96 never reached the ocean floor , so no data was collected			0
key topics for the @entity13 the key consideration at this week 's @entity13 meeting was developing protocols for tracking aircraft			1
the members listened to a brief presentation about several flight tracking technologies , but do not plan to prescribe a specific one			1
" let me also clarify that performance - based standards differ from ' prescriptive ' standards in that they do not restrict operators to specific technological solutions , " @entity12 said			1
" this systems - based approach acknowledges that what will best service airlines and manufacturers over the longer term will be the flexibility to choose from amongst the latest and most cost - effective innovations that meet their global flight tracking needs			1
" one potential standard could be preventing anyone from being able to turn the off flight tracking systems			1
this is not the first call for such international standards			2
@entity178 crashed in 2009 in the @entity179 off the coast of @entity181 , killing more than 220 people			0
it took five days to find wreckage and nearly two years to find the underwater debris field			0
the @entity187 accident investigation board recommended that authorities " study the possibility of making it mandatory " for commercial airlines to regularly transmit basic flight parameters , including position , altitude and speed			2
the @entity13 changed some standards after the @entity198 accident , which will go into effect in november			2
in what documents describe as " initial steps , " airlines were told to make better use of existing communication links , introduce mandatory warnings sent to air traffic control when a plane deviates from the cleared route , and improve procedures to ensure better connections			0
" this was also identified as a low - cost solution , using existing ( equipment ) and technology , " the @entity13 secretariat wrote in working papers presented to this week 's meeting			0
now the organization is considering going further , mandating more frequent and more detailed flight tracking information			1
separately , a satellite communications company proposed a free global tracking service ahead of the meeting			2
@entity224 , the company whose satellite had the last known contact with flight 370 , said the service is offered to the 11,000 passenger aircraft already outfitted with an @entity224 connection			2
it said the tracking would cover " virtually 100 % of the world 's long haul commercial fleet			2
" @entity235 for plane is the most difficult in history @entity2 's @entity238 contributed to this report from @entity0 and @entity240 wrote and reported from @entity241 .			0

a @entity4 agency studies flight tracking technologies
@entity4 forum focuses on better flight tracking after @entity7 disappeared
the aim is to develop standards to reduce chances this could happen again
@entity7 disappeared in march on routine flight from @entity57 , @entity58 , to @entity59
