@entity3 prime minister @entity2 , a strongman in the troubled @entity4 and a key @entity6 ally , has died , his government announced tuesday			1
@entity2 had not been seen in public in months , sparking intense international speculation about his health			1
the government revealed neither the cause nor the location of his death monday at the age of 57			0
@entity2 came to the forefront as a leader of a guerrilla insurgency against dictator @entity18 in 1991 and cemented power in the ensuing decades			1
seen by admirers as a force for stability in a region with @entity25 insurgencies in @entity26 and @entity27 and a history of famine , he was also criticized for cracking down on political opposition and the press			1
" he came to power at the barrel of a gun , but he made the transition from rebel leader to political leader very quickly , " said @entity32 , a writer on @entity33 and director of @entity35			1
but he never overcame his " mindset as a rebel leader , " and his democratic credentials were " poor , " @entity32 said			0
" the @entity45 turned a blind eye to many aspects of his game that were not up to scratch , " he added			0
that 's partly because of his action against @entity25 movements in the region , including an invasion of @entity26 in 1998 , @entity32 said			0
" he supported everything that the @entity6 wanted to do against terror , " he explained , such as give @entity6 drones based in the region permission to use @entity3 airspace on their way to targets in @entity26			1
and " he was able to address the fundamentals -- health care , education , reducing the poverty rate , " @entity32 said			0
@entity6 president @entity69 praised @entity2 ' " unyielding commitment to @entity3 's poor " in a statement tuesday , citing his " personal admiration for ( @entity2 ' ) desire to lift millions of @entity3 out of poverty through his drive for food security			1
" but in june , @entity6 sen. @entity77 , a @entity79 @entity78 , highlighted a different aspect of @entity2 ' rule -- the case of journalist @entity83 , who was then before a court in @entity85			1
while praising the prime minister 's work in " containing the real threat of terrorism in the region and making gains against the region 's recurring famines , " @entity77 accused him of " trying to silence those who do not toe the official line			2
" his @entity97 took all but one seat in parliament in elections in 2010 , @entity33 expert @entity96 pointed out in the wake of @entity2 ' death			1
" nearly 200 people were reportedly killed , and tens of thousands detained " in the previous elections in 2005 , said @entity96 , who is with the @entity105 think tank in @entity106			0
last year , @entity3 found two @entity111 journalists guilty of supporting terrorism and sentenced them to 11 years in prison			1
@entity2 died at 11:40 p.m. monday from an unspecified infection , spokesman @entity114 said			2
deputy prime minister @entity116 is now in charge			0
there will be no elections before the next scheduled ballot in 2015 , @entity114 said			0
@entity2 had been scheduled to step down in 2013 as part of a transition process , @entity96 said , but questioned whether he genuinely intended to relinquish power			1
@entity2 was out of the country when he died and members of his family were with him , according to @entity114			2
he did not say what country @entity2 ' body was in or when it would return to @entity3 , except that it would be soon			1
the spokesman acknowledged the prime minister had been sick for some time but did n't immediately seek treatment			0
the news came almost a week after the government said @entity2 was " recovering well " after treatment for an unspecified illness			2
bloggers launched a counter of the number of days he 's been missing , while citizens took to social media to discuss his whereabouts and exchange conspiracy theories			0
the secretive nation had released little information about his whereabouts , prompting rumors and opposition claims that he was dead or facing a life - threatening illness			0
the government held a news conference last month and announced @entity2 received treatment for an unspecified illness			2
his absence was more evident last month when @entity3 hosted an @entity155 summit in its capital of @entity85			2
@entity2 , a key player in talks on the tensions between @entity159 and its rival neighbor @entity159 , did not attend			2
former @entity162 secretary - general @entity161 said @entity3 under @entity2 had " played a key role in both the region and the @entity33 continent			1
" " i hope that his successor will continue to be a driving force on a wide range of issues , from brokering peace negotiations to shaping development relationships , " @entity161 said			0
@entity3 , a key @entity45 ally often lauded for effective use of aid money , is surrounded by unstable nations such as @entity26 and @entity159			0
@entity2 has been credited with working toward peace and security in the region , and the @entity3 army sent peacekeepers to battle the @entity182 extremist group @entity181 in @entity26			1
