-- with only a 45 minute flight separating @entity3 and @entity4 , you 'd think i 'd have been to @entity6 at least once in my 22 - year existence			1
unfortunately until july 2013 , the concepts holiday and @entity9 have never gone together in my head			1
@entity11 was @entity12 and structurally unsound towers ; or @entity15 and discount shopping or @entity16 and baguettes			2
not @entity6 , longstanding " frenemy " of @entity22 , with the football team we all rooted for in the last @entity20			1
yet , that 's no reason to actually visit the place			2
i went for a family wedding			2
if not for love , perhaps another 22 years would have passed before i made it to @entity4			1
the first thing that struck me almost as soon as i stepped off the plane was the manner of the people			2
now i know it is hackneyed and @entity33 and terribly @entity35 © d to praise the hospitality of the locals and so i make the next statement knowing that i tread on imperial ground : @entity6 are nice			1
the friendly coconut seller in the photo above is just one of the myriad of fresh produce vendors that are dotted around the city			1
you spy a coconut , you pick a coconut , he splits the coconut and you drink the water out of it , right there and then on the roadside			2
no preservatives , no plastic bottles , just coconut			2
read this : 7 amazing mountain climbs in @entity9 i 've often wondered why the global indexes drawn up only rank things like " @entity62 " or " democracy , " with criteria that leave @entity66 countries nearer the bottom than top			1
if only someone would draw up a ranking for @entity71			2
this love of fresh food was on one occasion , however , taken to a rather bizarre extreme			2
my hotel restaurant did n't have half the dinner menu because the necessary ingredients were always bought fresh from the market and the market was closed ! speaking of hotels , due to exceptionally bad planning , i found myself staying in three hotels over eight nights			0
the last , @entity85 of @entity86 , was the best value for money			0
for $ 60 a night , i got an air - conditioned ensuite double room , beautifully landscaped grounds , the fastest internet i have used in @entity9 and reasonably priced meals in the restaurant			0
read this : @entity6 , the jewel of @entity9 now , as an original @entity3 , i have n't been to a place unless i 've gone shopping in a place			1
i hit @entity98 , @entity99 , on my second day in town			0
it 's a roadside market that caters to the cravings of an ankara lover like myself , or ' @entity66 print ' to those not quite in the know			1
however , for more upmarket shoppers who want their air - conditioning and shopping trolleys , there 's the @entity111 in @entity112 where @entity6 designers sell their work alongside international brands			1
in my humble opinion , local content was winning but i 'm a little biased			0
there are of course conventional touristy things to do in @entity4			1
for the reasonable sum of six cedis , you can enjoy the @entity124 , final resting place of the first president of @entity6			1
it 's a serene venue for contemplation			0
the museum on site sheds some light on the man behind the leader that was a pivotal part of the independence movement in @entity9			0
yet i also like to see the places not fashionable enough for the beaten track , places that probably would n't make it into a glossy tourist brochure			0
@entity6 , beautiful as it is , is still a developing country			1
there are shopping malls and skyscrapers -- one born every minute -- but there is also @entity144 , where i met a lady who chops firewood every evening to cook her meals			0
read this : artists take epic @entity9 road trip i had open access to @entity144 thanks to the organization @entity153 and their partnerships in the area			0
perhaps not all the @entity156 have been met in @entity144 but there were other signs of development that international agencies do n't often look for			0
i had my first private art viewing in @entity163 's studio in @entity144			0
only a stone 's throw away from that was a photography exhibition in @entity168			0
it was n't all sightseeing and games though			0
i also went to @entity4 for the very serious business of book promoting			1
i 've never been on radio in @entity9			0
it 's no different from being on radio in @entity177 except the presenters on @entity179 and @entity180 understood my accent			0
i left @entity4 determined to go on holiday in more @entity66 countries			1
forget @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186			0
@entity187 here i come ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			1
