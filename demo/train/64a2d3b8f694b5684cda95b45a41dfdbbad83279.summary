there 's the smart @entity4 graduate who loves to read			2
and there 's the brash , trash - talker who considers himself the best @entity9 player			2
one is quiet , reflective			0
the other can be loud -- very loud			0
much of @entity11 met the second @entity12 on sunday night when , after making an amazing defensive play to seal the @entity15 ' trip to the @entity16 , he ranted in a postgame interview about his opponent			1
on tuesday , we caught a glimpse of the first when @entity12 showed up for a sit - down with @entity23 's @entity22 for a mea culpa -- but not for long			1
" i probably should n't have attacked another person , " he told @entity22 in an exclusive interview that will air in its entirety friday night on @entity23 's " unguarded			1
" " you know , i do n't mean to attack him			0
and that was immature and i probably should n't have done that			2
" but then , @entity12 turned the spotlight on to him , making himself the victim , defending his actions and saying that what he regretted most was the way the media covered his rant			1
he also said he was shocked by some of the racists responses he received			0
" it was really mind - boggling the way the world reacted , " @entity12 said			1
" i ca n't say the world , i do n't want to generalize people like that because there are a lot of great people who did n't react that way			0
but for the people who did react that way and throw the racial slurs and things like that out there , it was really sad			2
especially that close to @entity63			0
" " i learned we have n't come as far as i thought we had , " @entity12 added			1
" i thought society had moved past that			1
" 5 things to know about @entity12 the best in the game ? @entity12 , 25 , has played in the @entity9 for three years after a standout career at @entity4			1
he was named an @entity71 the past two seasons at cornerback , a position where you often find yourself standing alone and defending against the fastest offensive players on the field			2
it takes a certain mix of bravado and confidence to excel at cornerback			2
and in sunday 's game , @entity12 brought both			1
@entity12 , who was defending 49ers receiver @entity84 near the end of the tight contest , batted a ball to a teammate			1
that move ensured the @entity15 a trip to the @entity16			0
the crowd was beside itself			0
and so , it seemed , was @entity12			1
" i 'm the best cornerback in the game , " he screamed during the post-game sideline interview			0
" when you try me with a sorry receiver like ( the @entity98 , that 's the result you are going to get			2
do n't you ever talk about me			0
" @entity101 sideline reporter @entity100 asked , " who was talking about you ? " " @entity84 , " @entity12 angrily responded			1
" do n't you open your mouth about the best , or i 'm going to shut it for you real quick			0
they 're more used to hearing players offer up cliches about what it takes to win , and hand down half - hearted congratulations to their opponents for being worthy adversaries			2
the bile flowed almost immediately -- tweets calling him a gorilla , an ape or a thug from the ghetto			0
" @entity12 deserves to get shot in the ( expletive ) head			1
@entity124 ( n - word ) , " said one , expressing a common refrain			0
emotion and regrets in his @entity23 interview , @entity12 said it takes certain characteristics to become a successful football player			1
and , he said , it takes anger			2
he said he was in that emotional state after the play sunday			1
" if you catch me in the moment on the field when i am still in that zone , when i 'm still as competitive as i can be and i 'm trying to be in the place where i have to be to do everything i can to be successful ... and help my team win , then it 's not going to come out as articulate , as smart , as charismatic -- because on the field i 'm not all those things , " he said			1
@entity12 said the vitriolic response surprised him			1
what he did was " within the lines of a football field " -- trash - talking an opponent but not hurting anyone , he said			1
the commenters , he said , were out of bounds			0
" they had time to think about it , " he said			0
" they were sitting at a computer and they expressed themselves in a true way			0
" getting to know @entity12 " but these people are acting like i attacked them in some way , like i went after them , " he added			1
" i did my job effectively			0
and afterwards , they interviewed me and i had an interview			0
regardless of how that interview goes , it does n't give you the right to say -- the things they were saying			0
and that 's the part that 's sad			2
" all the way to the bank there 's no such thing as bad publicity , the saying goes			2
and to hear @entity12 's agent tell it , the controversy has been good for him			1
@entity12 's @entity187 follower count has exploded in recent days			1
and the agent says his phone is ringing off the hook			0
" @entity193 knows who @entity12 is , " said @entity191 , who manages @entity12 's marketing deals			1
" i talked to brand managers this week and they are fired up			0
they say this is real			0
we finally have a player who is willing to speak his mind			0
" but such exposure can be a double - edged sword , says @entity207 , an associate professor of @entity209 education at @entity210			0
" he deserves all the marketing money he gets , " @entity207 told @entity23 's @entity211			1
" my concern though is when they use this image , will they see him as an extraordinary athlete who has a knack for talking trash or frame him as another angry , violent athlete ? " @entity191 admits there are two @entity223 : the one who stormed off the field , and the one he wants @entity11 to see			1
" the amount of emotion , anybody who 's played a competitive sport in a championship level knows what it 's like to have those emotions running , " said @entity191			2
" here 's a guy who 's never been arrested , never said a curse word in a post-game interview , and when you look at his body of work off the field and what he does for the community and charity , it 's two completely different people			0
" opinion : @entity12 has only himself to blame			2

@entity12 says attacking an opponent *verbally* was " immature "
@entity12 talks to @entity23 's @entity22 about the *backlash* that followed the comments
he says he was still in the emotional zone it takes to play football successfully
the star defensive back also says he thought @entity11 was past racial attacks
