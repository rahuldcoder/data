-- @entity1 jumped from the edge of space			1
@entity4 plunged to the ocean 's lowest depths			1
@entity1 broke the sound barrier			2
@entity4 discovered an " alien world			2
" call them daredevils , explorers , neither or both			0
no matter what , their record - breaking solo feats , backed up by teams of specialists , literally raised and lowered the bar for human achievement			0
so , for others aspiring to chart new terrain , what 's next ? we asked for your ideas			2
@entity26 @entity27 and @entity28 wrote us on @entity29 , saying it 's time to work on getting lower			2
" journey down in to the center of @entity33 , " wrote @entity27			1
@entity28 added , " @entity34 for real ! " that may be a very , very , very long way away , but downward steps are already being taken in that direction			0
a new $ 1 billion mission plans to drill 3.7 miles beneath the sea floor to reach the @entity33 's mantle , a nearly 1,900 - mile - thick layer of slowly deforming rock between the crust and the core , which makes up the majority of the planet			1
what we learn below can go a long way toward showing us what 's above			2
the deepest crack found in the @entity33 's crust , on the @entity55 floor , included signs of life -- which could indicate that alien life could exist on other planets , according to @entity60			1
walk on @entity62 " obviously , the first person to set foot on @entity62 is the next big story , " wrote @entity63			1
again , a far jump ( ha ha ) from anything @entity1 and @entity4 have done , and more in the realm of astronauts ' incredible achievements -- but , again , a big new goal explorers are working on			1
in fact , it could happen within 20 to 30 years , according to @entity76 , director of @entity60 's @entity77			1
" i think engineering-wise , we know how to do it to some level			0
we still need a lot of development and a few inventions to do that , " @entity76 told @entity0			0
" so at the end it would become a question of national will if we want to keep our exploration , expand our vision and expand our exploration in the next 20 to 30 years			1
" in the meantime , @entity60 is celebrating the success of the @entity62 rover curiosity			1
individual atmosphere re-entry much closer to home , @entity97 writes , " the next step is individual atmosphere re-entry			0
that would be an amazing feat ! " it would -- and @entity1 's jump may have gotten experts closer to making that happen			1
" the long - term hope is that we can one day develop a suit that would allow a human to reenter the atmosphere from space without the help of a spaceship , " @entity107 wrote			2
in a blog post before @entity1 's jump , @entity107 said if the event was successful it would " be a big step forward			2
" re-entering @entity33 's atmosphere can be like splashing into a lake , the @entity120 explains			1
it 's " a dense , fluid medium , which , at orbital velocities , is not all that different from a lake 's surface			0
" astronauts have to hit the atmosphere at a precise angle and speed to avoid " a big ' splash , ' which would mean a fiery end , " or a too shallow entry , which could send them skipping " off the atmosphere and back into the cold of space			0
this subtle dance between fire and ice is the science of atmospheric re-entry			0
" @entity1 's 100 - pound pressurized suit and helmet helped him survive the lethally thin atmosphere and intense cold of near - space			1
one day , the hope is , a suit could help save the lives of astronauts forced to bail out of a malfunctioning rocket on its way to space			0
politicians cooperate to little surprise , some of our social media responses focused on politics			0
politicians should " go where no one has gone before and start cooperating with each other , " wrote @entity160			0
" a third party nominee ascends to the presidency ! " wrote @entity164			0
the tech behind the @entity170 jump what ideas do you have ? post comments below or join the discussions at @entity29 and @entity175 .			0

you said : journey to @entity33 's core , go to @entity62
@entity1 jumped from the edge of space
@entity4 traveled to the ocean 's lowest depths
@entity60 official says a person could be on @entity62 in 20 to 30 years
