-- elation over the first @entity3 victory in @entity5 's @entity4 has been dampened by the death of two horses at the event			1
the race favorite -- @entity11 - trained @entity10 -- collapsed and died in his stall , minutes after crossing the post in last place			1
later @entity15 was reportedly put down after being spooked by a boy with a flag on his way back to the stalls causing the seventh - placed horse to suffer a serious leg injury			1
@entity22 had struggled in the race despite being widely tipped to win after an impressive win in the @entity25 in october			1
" the exact cause of death is yet to be determined , although the circumstances of the horse 's passing are very rare , " said dr. @entity26 , the head of veterinary and equine welfare at racing @entity28 , referring to @entity29			1
he said a postmortem would be conducted			0
" our sympathies are extended at this time to the owner mr @entity38 , trainer mr @entity39 and his staff who cared deeply for their horse and are naturally saddened by their tragic loss			0
" first past the post in prestigious @entity4 was protectionist , a five - year old trained by @entity46 , and ridden by @entity48 jockey @entity47			1
" he has won very easily and that is a very good horse , " @entity47 said			0
an ecstatic @entity46 said : " it 's unbelievable			1
we 'll probably later think about it and it 's a moment you wo n't forget in your life			2
" the five - year old -- one of the most inexperienced in the field -- won by four lengths , ahead of @entity63 's @entity62 , which placed second for a third time out of four starts			1
@entity66 's who shot @entity67 came third			2
second horse injured after being spooked @entity15 reared up and kicked a fence , badly injuring his right hind leg			1
the stallion was examined on site before being taken by ambulance to the @entity74			0
there , vets determined his injuries were too severe , and he was euthanized			2
last year , @entity79 was euthanized after snapping her cannon bone and dropping out of the race at the halfway mark			1
the coalition for the @entity84 ( @entity85 ) asked on its @entity87 page whether the " party was really worth it ? " " a recent study by @entity85 found that 125 horses died on @entity5 racetracks over a 12 month period , " added the horse protection organization			0
" thousands more are also sent to the knackery when no longer profitable			0
" today added two more casualties to those statistics			0
" just three weeks ago , @entity10 -- trained by @entity39 -- took first place in the @entity25 , putting the seven - year - old in prime position to take out the @entity4			1
just hours before the race , commentators speculated on whether he could take the rare double			2
ridden by @entity104 , @entity10 started out strongly but showed signs of discomfort with several hundred meters to go			1
" it 's very sad			2
he gave me a great thrill at @entity110 and for this to happen to him is just not fair , " @entity104 said			0
" i did n't think they 'd beat me			0
i thought he 'd win today and the whole way through the first half of the race i thought that too			2
" the @entity117 ( @entity117 ) released a statement saying it expects a full investigation to be conducted into both incidents			0
" events like these are a stark reminder to the community of the real risks to horses associated with racing , " the statement said			0
" sadly , injury and death are the price some horses pay for our entertainment in a sport that puts intense pressure on animals to perform to the limits of their endurance			0
" the @entity4 is the biggest event on the country 's racing calendar			0
there 's a public holiday every year in @entity28 , the southern state where the race is run			1
elsewhere around the country , work stops and many schools pause to watch the race live on television .			0
