-- to @entity1 or not to @entity1 ? for many travelers , especially those with children , it 's not even a question they ask			1
they already know the answer			0
" to these visitors , @entity1 is @entity10 , princesses , magic and fun			1
it 's happy memories of childhood brought back to life in your children , a clean place where the rides are safe and the @entity1 characters are always happy to pose for pictures with your kids			1
that 's @entity26 , who visited once as a child and walked back into the @entity28 in the mid- 1990s with her young son			2
" it was so perfect , everybody was so happy , everything was so maintained , " said @entity26 , who now works for the @entity30 , an unofficial @entity1 planning and fan site			1
" you were in a perfect fantasy world			0
that , and my little boy loved it			0
" but for other vacationers , @entity1 inspires a firm " no. " to those travelers , @entity1 is merely a commercial machine built to sell tickets , overpriced toys and a stereotype of girls as princesses			1
they may remember visiting @entity49 or @entity50 when they were children , but they are n't taking their kids there			1
@entity1 to make way for @entity1 that 's the rev. @entity55 , who will be heading to @entity56 , @entity57 , this year for a work conference but will not be taking his family with him , even though his job will cover most of the costs of his trip			1
" we do not enjoy @entity1 , " wrote @entity55 , who went to @entity50 as a child , via e-mail			1
" we believe it symbolically represents the excesses of our extremely individualistic society			0
" what is it about @entity1 that creates such a strong response from its dedicated fans and foes ? whether you love or hate or merely tolerate the expansion of what @entity78 started in 1923 , there 's no doubting that @entity1 is popular and its influence is everywhere			1
all of those theme parks , resorts , cruises , movies , television shows , toys and other @entity1 businesses earned the company $ 11.3 billion in the last three months of 2012			1
more than $ 3 billion of that money came from @entity1 cruises and its 11 theme parks and 43 resorts across @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			1
one more park is under construction in @entity100			0
it ranked as the third most well - regarded company -- behind only @entity104 and @entity105 -- in a recent @entity107 survey of people 's opinions of the most visible companies ' reputations			2
@entity112 ranks @entity1 as the most admired entertainment company and the ninth most admired overall , behind @entity105 ( 1 ) , @entity114 ( 2 ) and @entity104 ( 3 )			1
still , there is this cultural split			0
@entity1 just rubs some people the wrong way			2
whatever people think about @entity1 , it 's probably what they 're also thinking about @entity123 society and its values , said @entity126 sociologist @entity125			1
" @entity1 does such a wonderful job of representing @entity123 culture , they 're almost synonymous with @entity95 , " said @entity125 , who teaches a three - week course , " @entity1 and @entity128 , " that includes a @entity50 site visit			1
" they are master storytellers , and they have the narrative business down pat. " and behind the magic , " @entity1 is a capitalistic corporation bent on consumerism , and that 's what drives our economy , " he said			1
" it brings out people 's opinions about our society and culture in general			2
you can love them or be very critical of those aspects of our culture and society because it portrays them so well			0
" why @entity1 might want to ' @entity155 ' the magic of their children 's reactions @entity1 is magic for @entity160 and @entity161 of @entity162 , @entity163			1
the @entity165 family and their two daughters have happily visited @entity1 theme parks about every two years , and the family has sailed on two @entity1 cruises			1
@entity165 even booked a family reunion on one of the cruises last year , reserving 10 cabins for his extended family two years in advance			0
" for us as parents , it 's a chance to connect back to our own childhood and brings back happy memories , " wrote @entity165 in an e-mail			2
" now that we have kids , it 's priceless to see their reactions as they experience the parks / rides / shows for their first time			2
words ca n't describe the preciousness of seeing our little ones thoroughly enjoying themselves on @entity1 attractions			2
" because it 's @entity1 , " we know we can expect top - notch entertainment each time we go , " wrote @entity165 , 46			1
" and there is an expectation that guests behave properly , which i appreciate			0
" @entity165 is n't a @entity1 apologist : he says that @entity1 's princess influence can be a bit much			1
he also wishes there were more healthy food options at the parks			0
" you figure a park of @entity1 's caliber could make the food experience better			1
" but he thinks it 's worth the occasional visit just to see the expressions on his girls ' faces			1
beyond @entity10 : @entity1 tops cruise ship rankings the @entity1 purist it just made sense to @entity218 that she would get married at @entity49 in @entity219 , @entity163 , this week			2
@entity220 , 26 , grew up 15 minutes away from the theme park and visited several times per week with her father and two siblings			0
her dad would drink from his @entity10 coffee cup with its free refills while the kids went on rides , and he 'd bring it home to wash for another day of free coffee			0
one cafe cook still working there remembers cooking breakfast for her on the weekends , @entity220 said			0
when @entity220 and her future husband decided on a two - month engagement and a small wedding reception , she quickly booked the park 's $ 5,000 wedding garden package for just 20 people ( including the bride and groom )			0
her father - in - law has given the couple a @entity1 cruise for their honeymoon to schedule whenever they 'd like			2
but @entity220 wo n't visit @entity50			0
" i grew up going to @entity49 , and that 's the original park , " she said			0
" i 'm a @entity1 conservationist			2
@entity50 looks so big , and it 's not him ( @entity78 )			0
i think you lose the intimate magic that happens at @entity49			0
it 's way more corporate			0
@entity49 feels like being at home			0
" excesses of commercialism for @entity257 and her family , a good vacation is spending time with their extended family , outdoors and in nature			0
@entity257 has n't ever visited any @entity1 parks but she says that paying lots of money to stand in line for " fast - paced , high - pressure " entertainment is n't for her			2
( her husband visited @entity49 and @entity50 as a child			0
) she also does n't want to support @entity1			2
" spending hundreds of dollars to wait in lines and be surrounded by consumerism does not appeal to us , " wrote @entity257 , who lives in @entity270 , @entity271			0
" @entity1 is a brand and also portrays a certain lifestyle that aligns with current corporate @entity123 culture			1
" we have chosen to live a more alternative life style that is rooted in sustainability , equality and entertainment that is independent of television and popular media			0
" the princess stereotype @entity283 of @entity284 , @entity271 , went to @entity50 in @entity57 as a child , but she wo n't be taking her daughters to @entity1 theme parks either			1
no matter how far @entity1 's princess stories have come , she does n't want her daughters limiting themselves			1
" while i am not averse to my daughters exploring fantasy worlds , i find that @entity1 and @entity78 products present children , especially girls , with a very limited fantasy world -- one in which a prince will sweep them off their feet so that they can then live happily ever after , " wrote @entity283 in an e-mail			1
" i want my daughters to be confident as individuals , not to grow up thinking there is a prince out there waiting to save them			0
" " in addition , i have a difficult time with the princess body types that @entity1 presents children with , which is an idealized adult female body type and not an appropriate one for my young and impressionable children to try to emulate			1
" consumer behavior expert @entity308 is n't surprised that people have such strong emotional reactions to @entity1 , positive or negative			2
" people have strong feelings about it because @entity1 is such a prominent part of their childhoods , " said @entity308 , chair of @entity313 's psychology department in @entity314			1
" whether you went to theme parks or watched movies and cartoons or got the goodies in some way shape or form , it 's touched nearly everybody 's lives			0
" the feelings @entity1 is able to evoke are incredible , she said			2
people who love @entity1 feel the perfection and happiness of the culture			1
" and that 's exactly what repulses other people ; a ' plasticness ' that other people find offensive			0
in a world that is increasingly crass and negative , it 's a positive , predictable happy place			0
" everything in moderation @entity344 minister @entity343 , 37 , has a word of caution for parents keeping their children completely away from @entity1 -- or anything else			1
her parents did n't take her to @entity1 theme parks because it would have been expensive to fly the family of four from @entity353 , @entity354 , to @entity163 or @entity57			1
they were saving for other things			0
@entity343 does n't remember wanting any @entity1 toys			2
" i really just wanted to ride the rides , " she wrote			0
" i definitely realized by high school that i was n't going there any time soon			0
" after a couple months of dedicated @entity360 relief work , @entity361 and her family were on a cruise with the chance to take a day trip to @entity50			0
" i 'm really thankful that my parents had n't taken me to @entity1 before , because it made this trip extra special , " she wrote			1
" plus , i did feel like a little bit of a @entity1 rebel -- finally getting to go			2
" parents can do everything in our power to limit our children 's access to the @entity377 , but even when we limit it , they 'll find other ways to watch the shows , sing the songs and be involved with @entity1 - something - or - another			1
we choose to enjoy it together as a family in small doses , which seems reasonable			0

@entity1 represents magical stories and fun family to fans
some parents delight in their children 's wonder during a first visit to @entity1
some critics think the company encourages kids to *buy* too much stuff
others worry the princess culture limits girls ' *potential*
