-- back in february the worldwide union for professional footballers @entity2 , conducted a survey of thousands of players in @entity6 and @entity7 , detailing the true extent of match - fixing , racism and violence in @entity13 football			1
just over nine percent of respondents in @entity2 's @entity16 survey reported examples of racism or other forms of discrimination , mainly caused by supporters ( 65.3 % )			2
the survey included the testimony of @entity23 of fc @entity24 , who detailed what it was like to play football in @entity29			1
" i have played for fc @entity30 for six years , " said @entity23			0
" in that time , there were always problems of violence and racism			0
" i remember a game where fans of my team insulted my colleague from @entity39 , @entity40 , because he is a black man			0
this was the first case of racism in @entity29 and the racism is still present			1
" but it was n't just racism that @entity23 encountered			0
" i do not know any professional player in @entity29 who has been able to provide the most basic requirements for life , " added @entity23			2
" @entity48 in @entity29 is full of crime and criminals and i could not cope , nor fight , with them alone			2
" the criminals in @entity29 football always look after their own interests first and use all means to achieve their goals , while the players have to keep silent and suffer			1
" fast forward to october and @entity29 is facing more scrutiny after @entity59 's @entity58 reported " a number of incidents of racism " to @entity13 governing body @entity66 following the second - leg of an under - 21 @entity62 playoff match on tuesday			1
@entity67 , a midfielder on loan at @entity70 side @entity69 from @entity71 , claims he was subjected to monkey chants before , during and after the match , while also alleging he had stones thrown at him by the crowd during the game			1
@entity77 was given a red card for kicking a ball into the stands after @entity59 scored a winning goal with the last kick of the match , sparking a mass brawl between both sets of players and staff			1
@entity89 war the @entity90 painted a very different picture of events on tuesday , saying it " absolutely refuses and denies that there were any occurrences of racism before and during the match at the stadium in @entity98 "			1
however , that view was directly contradicted by the @entity29 technical director @entity100 who went into @entity59 's dressing room after the game to apologize			1
" i have a lot of friends in @entity59 , i played there , " referring to his spell playing for @entity108 between 1995 and 1998			2
" i feel terrible about what happened because the people in @entity59 received us really well and i wanted to give them the same thing in @entity29			1
" @entity66 has subsequently charged both the @entity114 and @entity29 fas following events in @entity98			1
the @entity29 @entity58 has been charged with alleged racist chanting by fans , while both associations face charges overr the behavior of their players as the @entity29 and @entity114 fas jostled for the moral high ground , @entity123 prime minister @entity122 waded into the debate he called on @entity66 to impose " tough sanctions " on racism while sports minister @entity128 has written to @entity13 governing body 's president @entity129 following " extreme provocation and racism " during tuesday game			1
over the last year @entity114 football has had to grapple with the fall out of racism cases involving @entity138 striker @entity137 and @entity140 defender @entity139 , with @entity58 punishing both players			1
the difficulty for @entity29 , as shown by @entity23 's testimony , is that it has a history of racism not just at club level but also at international level , which @entity100 acknowledged , though he insisted that the problem " is no more than in other @entity13 countries "			1
five years ago , during another u- 21 match between @entity59 and @entity29 , the @entity150 country was fined Â £ 16,000 ( $ 26,000 ) by @entity66 for racial abuse directed at @entity59 defender @entity153			1
in february 2011 , @entity129 warned @entity29 and its clubs that a ban on competing could be imposed if fans continued to cause trouble			2
" it 's important to remember that @entity29 has only just come out of a genocidal war and that as events on tuesday unfolded in @entity169 , former @entity167 leader @entity166 is on trial in @entity171 , " said professor @entity158 , who has advised governments and police forces internationally on crowd management policy and practice , referring to @entity150 wars between 1991 and 1999			1
" so we should n't be surprised these societal problems manifest themselves in football , " added @entity172 , who runs his own consultancy and training company @entity178 and @entity179 " what we are seeing is a failure of various authorities to regulate behavior inside @entity29 stadiums			1
" over the last two years @entity66 has been trying to address the problem in @entity29			2
it is fully aware of the problems that exist there -- and working with the @entity190 @entity189 -- has been undertaking visits to @entity29 to initiate reforms , but clearly these interventions have n't yet worked			2
" what happened reflects a lack of proper regulation within the stadiums , and the effective management of crowds through legislation , policing , stewarding and also stadium licensing			0
" heysel during the 1980s , @entity66 banned @entity114 clubs from competing in its club competitions for a number of years after the @entity208 in 1985			2
the @entity210 chairman @entity209 believes @entity66 must impose a similar sanction on @entity29 -- if the racism allegations are proven			1
" @entity66 should ban @entity29 from international tournaments , " said @entity209			1
" i believe that this is what happened to @entity59 when violence and hooliganism came to the fore and that was what caused us to address the problem			2
" it 's only a ban of this nature , which has these ramifications , that will cause @entity29 as a football nation to address it			1
" professor @entity172 also backed @entity209 's call for @entity66 to act decisively			2
" i would argue that @entity66 now need to impose an effective sanction , " said @entity172 , who is a visiting professor at @entity228 's @entity227			0
" i would support calls to ban @entity29 from international football and their clubs from @entity13 football if such racist activity occurs			1
" out of all the agencies that have influence -- the @entity190 , the @entity238 , the @entity29 government and @entity58 , @entity66 is the most powerful in these circumstances			1
" do n't forget this is ultimately about money and a ban in @entity66 competitions will hit the @entity90 and the clubs in the pocket			0
these international and @entity13 fixtures are key sources of revenue			0
" ahead of the recent @entity250 tournament , @entity172 collaborated in the running of a pan-european police training program to share best practice among the continent 's police forces			0
" lots of @entity13 countries were involved , but countries like @entity29 , @entity259 and @entity260 were not , " added @entity172			0
government intervention the academic urged the @entity29 government and its football association to lead by example			2
" the @entity29 government has to make it an offence to actually monkey chant in a stadium			0
it is in the @entity123 , but i 'm not convinced it will be in @entity29			0
if it 's not an offence the police can do nothing about it nor the @entity58 even if they wanted to			2
" at the same time the @entity58 and the clubs need to create an environment of authority and governance to regulate behavior and expel those involved in it inside the stadiums			0
" in the @entity123 we have @entity286 , seated stadia , ticket numbers to identify which seat someone is sitting , shared information agreements between police and clubs , effective stewarding , police steward frameworks of co-operation			0
" that all comes back of the @entity298 report , " added @entity172 , referring to lord @entity298 's recommendation to improve stadium safety following the @entity301 disaster in 1989			0
" all of this stuff has to be in place to move the situation forward in @entity29			0
as you have seen the @entity29 fa have simply denied it took place , and the idea of getting anti-racist legislation enacted in @entity29 is almost surreal			0
" @entity100 accepted that action was needed from the @entity29 government			0
" the only difference i see is the actions of the governments in the respective countries			0
some countries are more decisive and more powerful and they deal with it , " said the former @entity108 striker			0
" unfortunately we have a lot of problems inside our country and our government right now			0
in the last 10 - 15 years we 've had other problems besides football supporters			0
" additional reporting by @entity0 's @entity328			0
