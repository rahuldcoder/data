-- they may not be big on looks but explorer yachts can realize even the most intrepid traveler 's desire for far - flung and exotic corners of the globe			1
explorers offer all the comforts of traditional superyachts but with souped - up specifications -- an ice - strengthened hull to cope with polar ice or ocean - going capability			1
which means these tough boats can cruise from @entity17 to the islands of the @entity19 and from the @entity21 ice to the @entity22			1
they also come with an impressive array of gadgets and gizmos : helicopters , fishing boats , luxury speed boats and state - of - the - art navigation gear are all among the play things likely to be aboard			1
while chartering one of these yachts is not within everyone 's budget -- prices range from about $ 100,000 to $ 500,000 per week , depending on the season -- most people can relate to the fantasy of escaping the crowds and exploring some of the world 's most remote and beautiful spots			1
' atmosphere ' why we like it : " @entity49 " is more than a yacht -- it is the perfect escape for the 21st century adventurer			1
it is a specially designed platform from which to explore undiscovered @entity17 in three ways -- by air , land and water , using the yacht 's on - board vehicles , which include a helicopter			1
where has it been ? it has been based off the fjord - like coast of @entity61 since its launch			2
its cruising area is 400 or so nautical miles from @entity65 in the north to the @entity68 peninsula			2
what its captain says : " my crew will fly you in helicopters , drive you to see wildlife in special tenders and take you on rugged shore - based excursions in one of a fleet of all - terrain vehicles we keep ashore in strategically placed locations along the coastline			1
we can fly you in the helicopter to isolated ski slopes with virgin snow			2
" @entity87 web site : @entity89 ' @entity90 ' why we like it : " @entity90 " was built for a yacht owner who purchased a shadow boat to carry the toys for his big white yacht but then discovered he enjoyed the shadow more than the other one			1
it 's not short on luxuries : every cabin has its own balcony			2
where has it been ? most recently it was deployed to @entity105 in the @entity106 where its huge hangar and massive crane were used to launch a research submarine that was looking for the lost city of @entity112			2
what its captain says : " there is nowhere we ca n't go			2
and wherever we go , we do so in style , carrying more tenders , toys and cars than you can shake a stick at			1
when you talk about carrying a helicopter , we ask how many would you like ! " @entity125			2

with five decks reserved for guests it commands vast interior and exterior spaces			0
where has it been ? @entity182 and @entity183 , where it explored some amazing uncharted river deltas , and the @entity187 south of @entity188 -- a perfect charter area with 365 islands , beautiful beaches with wonderful fishing			1
what its captain says : " our @entity197 @entity196 charter trips show off some of my yacht 's better features			0
its seaworthiness sailing between island groups and its ability to carry a large tender on deck , which we use to explore lagoons and diving areas , make it the perfect yacht			1
our large deck spaces are good for bringing entertainment on board -- including , once , a large @entity215 dancing group ! " @entity216 web site : @entity218 ' @entity219 ' why we like it : built for the @entity222 as " @entity223 , " it was one of a flotilla that undertook voyages around the world to ensure that the @entity228 's hydrographic charts were fully up - to - date			0
