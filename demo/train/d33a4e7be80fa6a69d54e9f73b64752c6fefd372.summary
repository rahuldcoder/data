-- @entity1 , the award - winning director and pioneering comedian who was one of the few people to win an @entity5 , a @entity6 , an @entity7 and a @entity2 , died wednesday evening , according to a note from @entity10 ' president to its staff			1
@entity12 , 83 , who directed " who 's afraid of @entity14 " and " @entity15 , " was the husband of former " @entity18 " anchor @entity17			1
@entity12 ' influence looms large in entertainment			1
he was among the founders of the @entity23 , the predecessor to the @entity26 - based comedy troupe @entity25 , which has been a proving ground for comic talent for more than four decades			2
share your memories of @entity1 as a performer with @entity32 in the late ' 50s and early ' 60s , he took comedy into places it had seldom gone before , bringing an improvisational swagger and intellectual edge to a field that had been dominated by joke - telling standups			2
" @entity12 combined the political and social satire of ( @entity46 ) @entity45 and ( @entity48 ) @entity47 with the inspired comic skits of ( @entity51 ) @entity50 and ( @entity53 ) @entity52 , " wrote @entity40 in a 2013 @entity42 profile			1
@entity12 was also an outstanding theater director			1
at one point in 1967 , he had four plays running on @entity57 -- including two by @entity58 , " @entity59 " and " @entity60 " -- and he was a go - to guy for stage works until the end of his life , helming @entity65 's " @entity66 " ( 1984 ) , " @entity67 " ( 2005 ) and a 2012 revival of " @entity69 " starring @entity70			2
but he 's probably best known for his movies , including the groundbreaking " @entity15 " ( 1967 ) , the @entity7 - nominated " @entity74 " ( 1983 ) and box - office smash " @entity75 " ( 1996 )			2
he was known as an " actor 's director , " one able to pull strong performances from his ensemble and capable of seeing things others did n't			1
@entity81 remembered @entity12 ' ability at an @entity84 tribute			1
@entity70 observed that @entity15 , the character he played in " @entity15 , " was a tall , blond , wasp - y type in the novel			2
( indeed , among the actors considered for the role was @entity89			2
) but @entity12 saw the character as uncertain and neurotic , qualities @entity70 brought to life on screen			1
" and so i thank you for casting this short , 29 - year - old , unknown actor with a prominent nose to play @entity15 , " @entity70 said			2
" @entity97 bless you , sir			2
you 're more than a great director			1
you 're a real artist down to your toes , because you 're insanely courageous			2
" starting with two phrases @entity12 was born @entity1 in @entity101 in 1931			1
with war clouds looming and @entity104 persecution of @entity105 rising , he immigrated to the @entity106 in 1939			0
as recounted in the book " @entity108 , " a young @entity12 arrived in the @entity106 knowing only two phrases : " i do n't speak @entity109 " and " please , do n't kiss me			1
" the family changed its last name to @entity12 after settling in @entity112 , where the family patriarch established a medical practice			1
@entity12 attended college in @entity26 and later headed back to @entity112 , where he studied acting under famed teacher @entity117			1
he returned to @entity26 , where he started up a comedy troupe and met @entity32			0
the pair would go on to form a partnership that would later take @entity57 by storm			0
@entity12 said he took to the stage			1
" i liked doing the stand - up , " @entity12 told @entity125 in 2012			1
" i only stopped because @entity32 wanted to stop			0
i 've never understood it			0
i thought : ' why ? it 's not a very long show			0
it does n't cost us anything emotionally			0
' " he moved behind the scenes and directed @entity89 and @entity135 in " @entity59 , " which won him his first @entity2 in 1964			0
for a time he was @entity57 's golden boy , with success following success : " @entity133 " ( 1964 ) , " @entity60 " ( 1965 ) , " @entity139 " ( 1966 , featuring a young @entity140 ) , " @entity141 " ( 1968 ) and " @entity142 " ( 1971 )			0
" @entity59 , " " @entity60 , " " @entity141 " and " @entity143 " were all written by @entity58			0
he was also the director of the musical " @entity144 " ( 1977 ) , which was one of @entity57 's longest - running musicals when it closed almost six years later			1
notable movies more acclaim would follow for his work on the big screen			0
his first film was a biggie : " who 's afraid of @entity14 " ( 1966 ) , starring @entity155 and @entity156			1
it was nominated for 13 oscars and won five , including a best actress trophy for @entity155			0
his next film , however , was in many ways even more impressive : " @entity15 , " which made innovative use of pop music ( thanks to @entity173 's songs ) , featured a terrific script by @entity163 and @entity164 and became a blockbuster sign of the @entity166 -- one led by youthful moviegoers and antihero protagonists			2
" @entity12 and veteran cinematographer @entity176 threw out the ( @entity178 ) playbook for ' @entity15 , ' experimenting wildly with lighting and lenses , lending the film a sense of freewheeling freshness , a sheen of visual inventiveness that has n't dimmed over the years , " wrote @entity175 's @entity174 in a 2012 look back			1
@entity12 won best director for his work			1
his movies never quite caught lightning in a bottle again -- few movies do -- but still contained stirring scenes and fine performances : the launch of the planes in " @entity196 " ( 1970 ) , the sour @entity197 in " @entity198 " ( 1971 ) , the lives of blue - collar nuclear plant workers in " @entity74 " ( 1983 ) , the unrestrained glee of the plotting @entity202 in " @entity203 " ( 1988 )			0
he also directed the tv production of " @entity205 " ( 2003 ) , which won a then record - setting 11 emmys			0
his last film as director was 2007 's " @entity209			1
" " no one was more passionate about his craft than @entity1 , " @entity210 , president of @entity10 , said in a note to the staff			0
" he had recently been immersed in a new project for @entity216 to adapt ' @entity217 , ' @entity219 's @entity2 - winning play about opera legend @entity220			0
the project reunited him with @entity221 , one of his most frequent collaborators			0
" @entity12 occupied that rare air in the industry of those who have won the @entity227 -- an @entity5 , a @entity6 , an @entity7 and a @entity2			1
in 2012 he earned his record sixth @entity2 for best direction of a play for " @entity230			0
" he met @entity17 later in life ( he was 54 at the time ) and she became his fourth wife			1
he told @entity125 that he first spotted the then - " @entity236 " correspondent on a flight and later struck up a conversation with her			0
" i found her and said , ' you 're my hero			0
' and she said : ' no , you 're my hero			0
do you ever have lunch ? ' she wanted to interview me for ' 60 minutes			0
' i pretended that i was up for it , and we had about 14 lunches			0
" the couple was married for 26 years			2
in addition to @entity17 , @entity12 is survived by his three children -- @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 -- and four grandchildren			1
