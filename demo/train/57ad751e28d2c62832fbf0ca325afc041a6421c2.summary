-- i am staring down a $ 71.97 box of @entity3 at my local @entity4			0
my daughter wants @entity6 to bring her one of these pretty pink and purple kits for @entity9			0
these are the toys that @entity3 made to appeal to girls after decades of making toys they once marketed as being gender neutral			1
see the evidence in a 1974 @entity3 's note to parents who bought its toys , noting that parents should let their children create whatever they want without regard to gender or skill			1
" the most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them , " the note says			2
now @entity3 wants my daughter to play with @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 and @entity37 , characters @entity3 has already named and decided should go to hair salons , save animals and work at a @entity40 © in @entity41			0
boys , on the other hand , can go to a different aisle at the store i 'm visiting to buy " @entity49 " - themed fighter jets , with their weapons designed to blow up everything			1
while i do n't object to haircuts or animal rescue efforts or " @entity49 , " i do n't know why a toy designed to foster children 's creativity -- explicitly not making pieces that predecide what my child should create -- now needs to decide everything for her			1
" everything " includes what boys and girls should like			1
and so far , my daughter -- who loves all the colors of the rainbow but is n't a big fan of the color gray -- loves her @entity3			2
i worry what those purple and pink @entity69 are telling her			1
seeking gender equality in a @entity3 world " toys traditionally tell our children what we expect their roles to be as adults , " says @entity74 , author of " @entity75			1
" " that 's why girls had dolls and dustpans , and boys had erector sets			1
" " i do n't think any parent wants to limit their children now , and i think all of us know that our kids -- boys and girls -- need skills in both construction and caretaking to be successful adults , " said @entity74			1
" so during the holidays , i 'd try to think creatively on a number of fronts : where gender is concerned broadening ( your child 's ) concept of what it might mean to be female or male where and when you can			1
" a classic study of young children 's bedroom toys found boys had action toys , moveable toys , things children can use to act			1
by comparison , young girls ' rooms were more likely to be filled with soft , frilly and cuddly toys			1
while some of those toys can be connected to children 's preferences , there 's no way to know whether children might like toys associated with the other gender if they never have them in their rooms			1
when kids play across gender lines how to combat it ? parents can actively engage their children in play that defies traditional gender stereotypes , says @entity135 , a @entity136 psychology professor who specializes in gender stereotypes among young children across cultures			1
parents can also choose toys that encourage children 's imagination , @entity135 says			1
" one of the sad things about toys these days is they do everything for the kid , " says best			2
" some of the things i loved were totally neutral : taking cardboard boxes and drawing on them , making forts by spreading bed spreads across the chair , putting on shows ( with my cousins )			2
" that ability to think creatively , not just for a puppet show but complex challenges in adult life and work , is crucial			0
i am grateful that my child 's school focuses on creativity and noncommercial play , and teachers actively discourage television viewing			2
her teachers want to know what 's in her imagination , not in the imagination of the adults at @entity174 , @entity175 or @entity176			2
most of the toys in our house are raw material for her imaginative play : paint , clay , beeswax , yarn , felt , bits , crayons , bits of nature , lots of costumes that turn her into anyone she wants to be -- and @entity69			1
and of course cooking and baking , the bike , the soccer ball and jump ropes			0
we are striking a balance , i hope			0
lest the @entity174 fans think we are deprived , we let " frozen " into our world			0
( i blame @entity206 , the voice of @entity208 , whose singing i adore			0
) my child did n't choose the sweeping gowns and odd makeup @entity213 or @entity214			2
she wanted @entity215 , which she got , and she gave us lots of warm hugs			0
@entity219 says pink toy ovens discourage boys from kitchen play back to my original challenge : what is @entity6 to do ? my daughter does n't ask @entity6 for a lot : one big present , rarely more			1
i get her a few things from the real me , and other members of the family give her fun and thoughtful presents			0
she 's not greedy , which makes me happier than i can say			0
so i turn to the best source on my child , the child herself			0
why not the " @entity49 " @entity69 , segregated in with the other " boy " toys in the @entity4 near our house ? " they 're all gray , and they just have guns			1
you ca n't build other fun stuff with them			0
when she received a smaller version of the @entity251 kit a couple months ago , she quickly built it according to the @entity69 directions to see that she could do it			2
" now i 'm going to break it apart and build what i want			0
" she still wants to build what she wants , despite @entity69 ' directions			2
@entity3 's mission , despite the current betrayal of the company 's goals , is still in place in my daughter 's brain			0
their plans are n't enough for her imagination			0
she is reaching for more			0
and , yes , @entity6 will bring her a pretty pink and purple kit and some new female scientist @entity3 people to build and break apart .			0

@entity69 used to be known for gender - neutral toys that **inspire*d* children to create
now the toys tell children in advance what 's good for boys or girls
even toys not targeting one gender still do n't *inspire* children to imagine
surround children with open - ended toys that will help them make whatever they want
