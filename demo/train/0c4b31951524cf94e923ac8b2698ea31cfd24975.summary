@entity0 -- in my @entity1 column last week , i wrote that the first thing a candidate running for office needs to know about @entity8 voters is that they value nothing more than respect			1
here 's the second thing : it 's not respectful to lump together latino @entity15 citizens with @entity8 illegal immigrants			1
not all @entity17 in the @entity15 arrived here five minutes ago			1
in fact , some of us come from families who have been here for five generations			0
and there are those in the state of @entity26 who can trace their roots in the @entity28 back several hundred years			0
this message is not getting through			0
just look at the comments posted at @entity1 in response to my column , which was about @entity8 citizens who can vote			1
many readers thought that i was demanding respect for illegal immigrants who ca n't vote : " how about the illegals start respecting our laws first off ? then we 'll talk			1
" -- @entity40 " i will respect them once they stop stealing money and jobs from the @entity15 citizen ... @entity47 ( sic ) they need to go back to @entity26 ... leave now and you may get a little respect , until then you are the enemey ( sic ) of the american ( sic ) worker and taxpayer ! ! ! ! ! " -- @entity52 " i have zero respect for the arrogant , self centered , disrespectful display of illegal foreigners marching and yelling - in @entity57 - in the streets of my country demanding my rights that they have not earned and are not entitled to ! " - for " want respect ? earn it by obeying the laws of our country , even the immigration laws ! " -- robbery in my e-mail in - box , there was more of the same : " @entity70 is something one earns			1
the @entity8 voter needs to respect this country and not use it as an @entity74 to send money to their families in @entity26			1
latino voters need to speak and understand the @entity80 language because that is how business is transacted			2
latino voters need to respect the rules and laws in this country and not demand bilingual education and ballots and drivers manuals in @entity57 ... " - @entity90 " are you saying that because @entity17 contribute to the economy , deserve respect and are family - centric , everything else does n't matter , even if they are here illegally ? ... this is the issue i see coming up with some who advocate for illegal immigrants : a lack of respect for our country 's laws ...			1
" -- @entity105 " in response to your recent @entity1 articles , i am 100 % against everything you stand for ... i do n't respect illegals , and i certainly want our president , weak as he may be , to continue to deport each and every illegal and every child of every illegal			1
drivers licenses and tuition for illegals ? ! ... you 're in my country			0
if you want respect , adapt to our ways ... " - @entity124 i 'm always amazed when i see comments like these			2
people are pretty worked up over the growth of the @entity8 community and the role that immigration played in fueling it			1
many of them can talk your ear off about that			0
and yet , not many of them seem to know any flesh - and - blood @entity17			1
if they did , they would know how ridiculous it is to treat @entity15 citizens and illegal immigrants as if they are one and the same			1
besides , they seem to put a lot of stock in what it means to be an @entity15			1
so should n't they be able to recognize @entity15 when they see them ? there is some good news , though			1
some readers figured out the difference between @entity8 citizens and illegal immigrants and tried to explain it to others : " just for the record , not every @entity8 in @entity15 is illegal			1
please stop combining us with the minority that came here illegally			0
i 'm sick of being told off for ' being illegal ' just because i 'm @entity161			2
my family has been here since the 1600s thank you very much			0
longer than most people 's families that tell me to ' go back to @entity26			2
' @entity169 is n't it ? " - @entity171 ah , yes			2
in the 20 years that i 've written about immigration , i 've been told that hundreds of times			0
i do n't suppose it has anything to do with being @entity176 ? apparently , i 'm not the only one hearing it			0
someone has even taken the experience and put it to music			0
the result is a profound and provocative song called " @entity183 " from one of my favorite @entity186 bands , @entity187			0
it goes like this : " they have shouted at me a thousand times that i should go back to my country ... because there 's no room for me here ... i want to remind the gringos : i did n't cross the border , the border crossed me ... and they can call me " invader			0
" that 's a very frequent mistake ... if we take into account centuries ... even if it bothers our neighbors ... we are more @entity15			2
. than all of the gringos ... " noting that " @entity15 " is actually made up of three continents and not just one , the lyrics declare that -- in reality -- @entity186 have been " @entity15 " longer than the descendants of @entity213 immigrants			1
in that sense , @entity186 immigrants to the @entity15 are more @entity15 than the folks trying to keep them out			1
if that sounds harsh , then so be it			0
a song like this is born of anger , frustration and righteous indignation			0
imagine being treated like a second - class citizen on your own home turf			0
i was born in the @entity15			2
the same goes for my parents , three grandparents , and half of my great - grandparents			0
and i 'm supposed to " go back to @entity26 " ? what ? you mean on vacation ? great idea			0
@entity237 is lovely this time of year			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240			2

@entity240 : do n't lump together latino @entity15 citizens with @entity8 illegal immigrants
@entity240 : not all @entity17 in the @entity15 arrived here five minutes ago
he says many readers mistakenly thought he demanded respect for illegal immigrants
@entity240 : some @entity17 have been " @entity15 " longer than the descendents of @entity213
