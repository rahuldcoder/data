-- the @entity2 couple arrested in @entity3 after pulling their cancer - stricken son out of a @entity7 told a judge they will not return to the @entity2 voluntarily , according to a @entity11 court where they appeared on monday			1
@entity12 and @entity13 remain in a @entity3 prison while the judge awaits information from a hospital in @entity17 about the medical status of 5 - year - old @entity19 , who has brain cancer			1
his parents can be detained for 72 hours in @entity3 before the judge has to decide whether they acted illegally when they defied doctors last week , took their son and sparked an international search for the child			1
hotel staff members in @entity17 , @entity3 , recognized @entity19 and his family from media coverage and contacted police			1
@entity19 was taken to @entity32 in @entity3 , and that facility was communicating with @entity34 , where the boy had been removed by his parents , hospital official said			1
@entity36 defended his actions in a @entity39 video made shortly before his arrest			0
he accuses two doctors at the @entity2 hospital for not allowing him to seek proton beam treatment outside of @entity2 , even though he said he was ready to pay for the treatment himself			1
" we pleaded with them for proton beam treatment			0
they looked at me straight in the face and said with his cancer , which is called medulloblastoma , it would have no benefit whatsoever			0
" @entity19 said he then looked on the @entity55 and found sites in the @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 on proton beam treatment that " said the opposite that it would be beneficial for him			2
" the @entity62 traveled to @entity17 with their six children to sell a home they own there , in order to " look for better treatment " for @entity19 , said their @entity3 lawyer , @entity68			1
the hospital in @entity34 issued a statement saying they discussed proton beam radiotherapy with @entity19 's parents			1
" we very much regret that the communication and relationship with the @entity19 family had broken down in this way and that for whatever reason they have lost confidence in us , " said dr. @entity73 , medical director at @entity34			0
" our first concern is for @entity19 's welfare " @entity73 said some tumors respond well to proton beam treatment , but " there are some cases where there is n't the evidence that this is a beneficial treatment , " he said			2
the hospital statement did not give specifics about @entity19 's case			2
the 5 - year - old 's ordeal has captured the attention of @entity2 prime minister @entity95			2
" i think people up and down the country will understand and be moved by the grave illness from which @entity19 is suffering			0
the priority must be that he receives the most appropriate care , " the prime minister 's official spokesman said			0
@entity19 's brother @entity105 posted a video on @entity39 explaining how the family cared for the sick child while traveling to @entity3			1
" this video shows information that would help in court to show that @entity19 was not neglected whilst not in @entity112 , " the video caption reads			2
only if the @entity3 judge decides that the @entity19 's acted illegally can the process of extraditing them back to the @entity2 begin , court officials said			1
in the @entity57 , only a handful of hospitals offer proton - beam therapy after surgery , including @entity112 , where the late @entity57 sen. @entity121 was treated for brain cancer in 2008			2
he died just a year after his surgery for malignant glioma			0
that surgery was followed by six weeks of radiation			0
@entity121 wrote about his experience in a @entity128 article at the time that he underwent proton - beam therapy			0
the theory behind proton therapy is that its high - energy particles zone in specifically on the tumor and so do not harm the surrounding healthy tissue as much as the x-ray photons in conventional therapy , said dr. @entity138 , associate professor of neurosurgery at the @entity140			0
