-- @entity1 is one of @entity3 's biggest directors , but lately he 's been delving outside of studio blockbusters to take on other kinds of projects			1
" my kids are grown , and i feel that i can afford the time to just be a little , you know , a little more experimental , " he tells @entity0			1
the 58 - year - old recently trailed @entity11 for an upcoming documentary he 's directing about the rapper 's role in the @entity15 due out in 2013 ; he 's mentoring @entity16 on his first directorial project ; and he 'll soon return as the narrator of the upcoming season of " @entity20			1
" says @entity1 of the comedy series ' new season , " it 's hilarious and it 's also really bold in terms of the approach to catching the audience up on the characters , and simultaneously sort of weaving their stories in and around a new set of predicaments			1
" so did you have fun hanging out with @entity11 ? i really did			1
the whole thing was interesting for me			2
i 've never interviewed anybody , first of all			2
i 'm pretty good at the initial instincts , and the very first time that i met [ @entity11 ] some months back , we met with him in his office and there was just something that i really respected about him			1
i think he 's pretty true to himself and pretty clear about what he thinks			1
kind of the opposite of mercurial , i 'd say			2
i do n't know what the opposite of mercurial is , but he 's i think tremendously focused			1
i 've been around a lot of artists who are also good at business and			2
one minute they 'll sound like an artist and the next minute they 'll sound like the characters in " @entity58			2
" @entity11 's a very good businessman and he talks about it and enjoys it , but he does n't shift			1
he has a sense of what he thinks people might appreciate , because he sort of trusts that if he appreciates it , there are people out there who will as well			1
and that 's what 's interesting to me : that he 's accomplished in those areas but i do n't hear that sort of cynical , world - weary quality			1
@entity11 gets assist from @entity74 at made in @entity75 and when he 's onstage , the confidence he has with the microphone is pretty amazing			1
i got to watch in the pit , right on the edge on the stage			2
i understood something that i never even really had thought about before			2
he really communicates , whereas i think some of the other hip hop artists -- they were great performers and they were dynamic and charismatic -- but on a consistent basis , every idea seemed to be a communication			2
i always thought that about @entity88			2
it 's a story they 're telling you			1
and i was kind of knocked out by that			2
i 've never seen @entity94 live , but in our movie , 8 mile , i felt like that was happening			2
what was that like ? i like their videos			0
i 'm laughing one minute , then my jaw drops the next			0
but i think they 're so wild and great and i really like them			0
[ @entity107 ] and i just started talking and he just kept looking at me kind of like squinting and saying , " you 're sick			0
" [ @entity110 ] i kind of knew it was a compliment , but i was joking later and said , " i thought i looked fine ! " i was trying to describe them to somebody			0
it 's kind of like there 's the @entity116 and @entity117			1
it 's pretty exciting to see that brand of anarchy and self expression adding up to so much			1
@entity11 , actually , was really interested in them			1
he said to me that he , you know , @entity124 , wanted to sign them and they went down the road discussing it , but ultimately @entity99 did n't want to be signed			0
they wanted to be self - reliant , self - contained			0
were there any highlights from the festival ? i think getting to talk to @entity133			0
photos : live at made in @entity75 that 's a very rare interview			1
yeah , and i do n't think he 's done very many			1
i would n't characterize it as probing , but , because it was on the subject of the event , i was glad to be able to share with him what i was hearing from everybody -- which is that everyone was so impressed with his reemergence and a kind of new level of musicianship			0
i heard that from several people			0
and i passed that along to him , so more than sort of the interview i was glad to be able to communicate that to him , and he was , i think , flattered to hear that			0
but you know , he 's really focused and hard at it , and i think he 's really glad to be out there			1
it was also fun to see @entity162			0
i talked to them both and they barely rehearsed			0
i remembered that when @entity165 and i , four years ago , did this @entity167 sketch for @entity168			0
it was so funny , because i was wearing this hair piece , @entity165 was wearing kind of @entity173 wig and we fell into it and i swear to @entity176 , i honestly @entity177 » ' ed and thought i was back in the @entity179 's parking lot doing a scene			1
so when i saw those guys , they just nailed it			0
i just thought , " well , yeah , you know , sometimes when a thing becomes a part of a fabric of your life , your history , that does n't get so rusty			0
" when you were younger , because of @entity194 and @entity195 , people associated you with music of the @entity197 and early @entity198			0
what do you listen to ? i 've never been much of a consumer and we did n't listen to much music in the home except kind of at christmas time , so it was all @entity206 [ @entity207 ] and @entity208 and the @entity209			0
but it never became a passion			0
i did n't really listen to music when i was doing homework or when i when i work on a script			0
i tend to drift to @entity215 and news			0
it 's interesting that you 're working with @entity16 , too			1
my kids are grown , and i feel that i can afford the time to just be a little , you know , a little more experimental about what i do with my time away from the movies and the tv shows , which are still my main drive			1
@entity16 just came through this project , @entity227			0
this is year two of that , and last year we did it and my daughter @entity233 directed the film , and people send in pictures targeting their own photographs for certain narrative categories			0
and then the public votes and they narrow it down to 10 , and last year i chose one from each category and handed it over to @entity233 and she had to direct a movie			0
it was a great creative experiment			0
with @entity16 , we wanted somebody from the music world , and of course he 's so creative and visual and a really talented and intelligent guy			1
so i 'm actually dying to see what he does with this exercise			0
i think i 'm going to be inspired by him			0
theoretically , i 'm supposed to be offering some guidance and support , but i think he 's one of the ones i 'm sort of most curious about seeing work with this whole program			1
would you ever work with @entity11 again ? i would do a documentary about @entity262 , i would			1
i mean , that 's not what this is particularly , but he 's central to it			1
but if i had a chance and i thought i could do it justice , you know , i think he 's a great subject			2
he 's a great subject			2
how is it going with " @entity20 " ? it 's going great			1
there 's a really good article that somebody did , an interview with @entity279			2
it 's hilarious , and it 's also really bold in terms of the approach to catching the audience up on the characters and simultaneously sort of weaving their stories in and around a new set of predicaments that are , you know , a brand new sort of five - alarm fires or however many alarms , whatever the maximum number of alarms is			1
i should remember that from " @entity297 , " but i do n't			0
