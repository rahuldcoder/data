-- @entity1 wants to cut clutter			1
the social media site , which has more than 1 billion users , on thursday announced a newly redesigned news feed that blows up photos and visual content , and adds categories that focus on specific types of content			1
the web version of the social network now looks much more like the mobile apps , which are also getting a revamping			1
@entity1 announced the changes during a media event at its headquarters in @entity18 , @entity19			1
the new web version will roll out slowly to users starting thursday , and updated @entity22 and @entity24 apps will be available in the coming weeks			1
chief executive @entity26 compared the revamped feed to a local newspaper and the new channels to the traditional sections , such as sports and business , you 'd find there			0
" i think that there 's this important and social place in this world for this customized newspaper , " @entity26 said			0
he did n't note the irony of comparing @entity1 to an industry that his site and others are marginalizing			2
the news feed is the first , and sometimes only , page people see when they log on to the @entity1 website or fire up a @entity1 mobile app. the nerve center of the @entity1 experience , the news feed fills the middle of this home screen with updates , photos , articles and other content and activity from your friends , such as likes and app updates			1
interspersed among that somewhat - chronological content are posts from pages you follow and targeted ads. the main page , which @entity1 is calling the " front page " to go with its newspaper metaphor , is adding categories so people can look at a more narrow feed of specific types of content as an alternative to the all - in - one view			1
there are views for all friends , most recent , close friends , music , photos , games and following			2
photos will show every single image your friends post as well as the photos posted by the pages you follow , including anything shared to @entity1 from @entity90			1
the music channel will show a combination of nearby concerts , feeds from musicians you follow and the songs friends are listing to with third - party apps such as @entity98			2
the channels will appear on the mobile apps and web versions of @entity1			1
" everyone 's going to start on the front page like they do today			0
this just gives people more power to dig into the topics they care about , " @entity26 said			0
the individual elements that populate the news feed have been redesigned to fill the page better , the company maintains			1
text is taking a back seat to visual content , which now makes up almost 30 % of the content in the news feed , according to @entity26			1
photos , videos and albums are bigger			0
shared articles show a bigger image and larger summary along with a logo for the publisher			0
content in the feed about individuals and pages will show a little slice of their timeline , including their cover photo and a button to add them as a friend or to like the page			2
maps and posts for third - party apps such as @entity138 have also been cleaned up			0
previously , the news feed occupied less than 40 % of the real estate on the @entity1 home page , according to @entity142 , @entity1 's director of design			1
to cut down on clutter and give the feed more room to breathe , navigation elements on the left have been slimmed down to a narrow black column of icons , similar to the mobile interface			2
one thing that 's not changing is the algorithm that decides what posts are displayed in a feed , which has received some criticism			0
@entity26 defended the practice of not showing a full and complete chronological feed of all content , saying people benefit from more important content , such as major life events , being given a more prominent place in their feeds			0
the filters might be great for users , but they could have a negative effect on companies that have sunk money into promoting their pages and gathering fans , said one analyst			0
those fans can switch to a more narrow feed of just their friends ( or music content or photos ) that does n't include brand pages , potentially making it more difficult for companies to reach their followers			1
" it 's going to continue to erode the value of companies having @entity1 pages and fans , " said @entity182 analyst @entity181			2
" @entity1 is walking a really fine line , they 're not providing enough value			2
" ads will still be featured on the friends - only feeds , so companies and brands that want to reach people who switch to those views can by buying advertising from @entity1			0
@entity197 says this could be interpreted as a " bait and switch " by marketers			0
ads -- which are included in the redesign -- are @entity1 's primary source of income			0
the company made $ 4.2 billion off advertising in 2012 , which accounted for 82 % of the social network 's total revenue , according to @entity210			0
most of that ad money comes from the web version of @entity1 , and 23 % was from ads on mobile devices			1
the company may get money from advertisers , but it needs to keep the users who click on those ads engaged , active and happy on the network .			0

@entity1 has redesigned the news feed to fill more of the main page
web version of @entity1 will look much more like the mobile app
new categories have been added for music and photos
update will begin rolling out thursday ; revised apps are coming in the next few weeks
