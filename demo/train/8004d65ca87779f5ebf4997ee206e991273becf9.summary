-- it was last fall when @entity0 originally broke the news that pop superstar @entity3 would be appearing on " @entity4 " as @entity6 's mother , @entity5			1
now , @entity3 is finally making her first appearance in the season finale ! sadly , @entity10 , the singer wo n't be carrying a tune in the episode , fittingly titled " goodbye , " which finds @entity14 's seniors graduating			1
" i do n't sing on the show but i kinda think that 's better because i think that would throw fans , " says @entity3			1
" hopefully , we can come back and do the singing			0
but i love to be on there and establishing a character			0
" @entity0 talked to @entity3 about her character 's relationship with @entity6 as well as her favorite " @entity4 " number of all time -- the answer may surprise you ! @entity0 : how did this come about ? @entity3 : first , we went to visit the set on the last season			1
my son lived out in @entity35 and we were visiting			0
we were all a big fans so we finagled our way on the set			0
@entity0 : did you guys wear disguises ? @entity3 : no no ! we were in the same room			1
i met @entity43 and i met @entity44 [ @entity45 ] and @entity46			0
i know @entity47 had been talking with the music people on the show and stuff about different things			0
but then @entity52 [ @entity53 ] reached out to me to play @entity6 's mom and i was thrilled because i think it was a great opportunity after what the grandma did to do something supportive			1
@entity0 : you mentioned this but obviously @entity6 came out to her grandmother and it did not go well			1
@entity3 : no not at all ! @entity0 : so is your character more accepting ? @entity3 : yes			1
i 'm very supportive of my daughter			1
you always have to have a back story even if you have one line			0
so my back story with @entity6 's mom was she did n't get to go to college so she really wants @entity6 to do that			1
up until now @entity6 has had a good relationship with her grandmother , but when she confronted her the response was very hard			1
she was probably the same way with @entity5			1
@entity6 's dad they mentioned was a doctor , so i think she helped put him through school , but decided for motherhood			1
[ @entity84 ] loved to sing and was a singer and put her life on hold because she thought being a mom was very important so she wants @entity6 to make it through			1
she 's supportive of her daughter			1
she just wants her to be happy -- bottom line			0
i know the feeling because my daughter is getting ready to do her last year of high school and she 's gon na do a summer program			1
it 's the first time we 're all going to be separated			2
i 'm there ! it was a very hard thing for me to imagine			0
@entity0 : how 's the chemistry between you and @entity43 ? did you all get along like gangbusters from the start ? @entity3 : yes			1
she was so sweet when we met on the set			0
she was really really nice and sweet			0
i thought we fell into the roles well			0
she was fun to be around			0
@entity0 : it sounds like you have scenes with @entity110 , too			2
@entity3 : yes we did			2
we had a scene at @entity4			2
i had to ask for a booster chair [ laughs ]			0
@entity0 : that must have been fun to be at such an iconic " @entity4 " location ? @entity3 : it was fun			1
there 's some very funny stuff with @entity110			2
it was a fun scene and it 's also poignant and there 's a scary moment there for the mom			2
@entity0 : did your family come to watch the shoot ? @entity3 : yes			1
my husband and my daughter			2
my husband said to me , " you know what ? you 're my wife but when you hugged her , i got choked up			0
" i know he 's probably feeling the same thing because of [ our daughter ] @entity138			2
i go , " that 's a good sign ! " [ laughs ] @entity0 : why do the @entity141 love " glee " so much ? @entity3 : i 'll tell you what i love : i 'm a musician first and foremost			1
music has been a really big and healing part of my life			0
i studied psychology so i tend to analyze a lot of things			0
but if you go back to @entity153 , you had musicals and happy things and escapist things because that 's what entertainment does -- it takes you away			0
you could n't have done this before because we were all too cheeky back in the ' 80s and ' 90s and would have snubbed our noses at something so whimsical			0
now , people need it ! it 's fun			0
my favorite so far was " @entity173 to answer / @entity174 is not a home			0
