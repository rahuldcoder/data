-- cell phone technology is helping developing nations prepare for disease threats such as a new strain of swine flu , an outbreak of measles or the increased spread of @entity9			1
workers in @entity11 use @entity12 for the first time nationwide during this year 's children 's health week			1
@entity11 proved it in 2007 , when the @entity17 nation suffered its first case of the polio virus in more than 20 years , said @entity20 , a health care worker at the @entity11 @entity22 and @entity23			1
as thousands of @entity25 fled to @entity11 to avoid violence in their homeland , the exodus sparked a serious health crisis , @entity20 said			2
" one case of confirmed wild polio virus put at risk the lives of 100,000 children , " he said			0
@entity11 health officials determined that they needed a way to quickly survey and assess the situation and initiate a massive immunization campaign			1
the solution was on the @entity40 , where they found a free , open - source application designed for personal digital assistants , called @entity12			2
open - source software is posted online for anyone to use and alter to suit their needs			0
downloading the software to cell phones enabled officials to gather data directly from the site of the outbreak and send it electronically back to headquarters for faster analysis			1
this cuts down on the time officials have to spend collecting paper surveys and analyzing them individually before they can begin treating people			0
" the information gave us useful feedback not only on the affected area but on the neighboring ones as well and helped us put plans and measures in place to stop the spread of the virus , " @entity20 added			0
physician and epidemiologist dr. @entity71 predicts that within a year , health officials will be using the technology to track other threats in developing nations , such as the recent @entity78 swine flu outbreak			0
@entity71 invented @entity12 in 2003 , after he and @entity80 technologist @entity79 began searching for a more efficient way to gather data on immerging diseases			0
they started a nonprofit organization , @entity85 , aiming to use mobile devices to efficiently and immediately gather public health information			1
" collecting data on paper and then taking two years to enter the data is a tremendous drain and barrier to good public health , " said @entity71 , who teaches pediatrics at @entity90 's @entity89			1
mobile devices such as @entity97 or handheld computers have been used for field studies since the late 1990s , but electronic survey methods have traditionally been expensive , labor - intensive and challenging to implement on a global scale			0
many global health institutions are now encouraging the use of advanced methodologies such as smart phones and open - source software as the next generation of data transmission , said dr. @entity110 , an informatics scientist at the @entity111			1
@entity12 frees health care workers from hiring programmers to create electronic surveys			1
data gatherers can customize their questionnaires online , download the questionnaires onto a cell phone that has internet capability , poll patients and do direct analysis , all through a touch pad on a cell phone			0
@entity20 credits the technology with saving @entity125 who were threatened by a frightening outbreak of measles in 2007			0
the government did n't know that vaccine supplies were low , he said			0
using @entity12 , health care workers discovered that 60 percent of their vaccine stockpiles in remote areas were missing			1
they mobilized a response within three weeks , he said			0
" imagine if we have an outbreak of measles and the information is relayed to us three months after the outbreak			0
by the time we respond , lives would have been lost , but if we can get the information in a day or half a day , we an mount a quick response , " @entity20 said			2
" by being able to relay the information at an appropriate time , that -- in and of itself -- is life - saving , " he added			1
fans point out that @entity12 's success hinges on ready access to technology already in place			2
" there are 4 billion mobile phones in the world ; 2.2 billion of those are in the developing world , " said @entity151 , who heads a partnership between the @entity153 and the @entity154 , which funded @entity12			1
sixty - four percent of all mobile phone users live in the developing world , according to a @entity162 estimate			2
by 2012 , the @entity162 believes , half of all residents in remote areas of the world will have mobile phones			0
compare mobile ubiquity to the 305 million pcs or 11 million hospital beds in the developing world , @entity151 said			0
the potential for mobile technology to help manage health care is huge , she said			2
with the help of the @entity162 's @entity175 and government health officials in more than 20 @entity17 countries , more than 800 health care workers are now trained to use this cell phone software , revolutionizing the way health care data can be collected , monitored and assessed .			1

disease - *control* software in cell phones is touted as boon to global public health
more than half of world 's cell phones are in developing countries
health workers in @entity11 stopped spread of polio in ' 07 using @entity12
@entity11 health care worker : relaying information at appropriate time is life - saving
