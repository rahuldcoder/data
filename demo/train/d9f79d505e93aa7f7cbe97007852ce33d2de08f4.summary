" repayment of loans was rare , " the report said , " and most often new loans were created to provide the appearance of repayment			0
" as a result , more than 92 % of the bank 's loan book , or $ 861 million , ended up being for the benefit of 19 related individuals and businesses that ultimately benefited just 12 individuals , the report said			0
that left the remaining $ 74 million for " legitimate customers			0

kos and the other authors also criticized @entity10 authorities ' efforts to investigate and prosecute the case			2
" there has been clear and direct interference with the criminal process by high - ranking officials that goes so far as to identify who should , and who should not , be indicted for criminal conduct , " it said			0
" the lack of action from the attorney general 's office also because of political influence has resulted in a lack of investigation , procedural delays that have allowed perpetrators to escape and likely for money derived from @entity9 to be lost forever , " the report says			1
the attorney general 's office did n't respond to calls seeking comment wednesday			0
the report 's authors also appear to be unimpressed with the actions of a special tribunal set up to deal with the case of @entity9			1
" the tribunal appears to have been engaged in everything else except the processing of the one case they have before it , contrary to the most basic principles and laws related to fundamental justice , " the report says			2
" even the recent criminal proceedings at the tribunal do not wholly satisfy concerns about whether justice will prevail in the @entity9 case			1
" the report concludes with a stark warning : " if the systemic issues raised by @entity9 are not resolved , the viability of @entity10 as a fully functioning democracy is lost			1
