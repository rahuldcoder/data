-- we 're fresh out of english - language ballots			2
how about @entity3 instead ? that 's basically what happened to voters at one precinct in @entity8 after a series of unfortunate events			1
first , the polling place at @entity12 on the island of @entity14 ran out of ballots			1
a two - hour line formed as polling workers tried to shuffle hundreds of people through a single electronic voting machine			1
next , according to @entity21 , who was working the election , officials delivered more ballots -- but they were the wrong ones , featuring the wrong local races			1
" everyone stop ! the ballots are wrong ! " @entity21 recalls yelling over an angry mob			2
finally : a sorta - solution			0
@entity21 said he passed out @entity3 - language ballots to some of the @entity33 - speaking voters			1
by comparing the @entity3 ballots with those that included the wrong candidates , he said , the people of @entity8 finally were able to vote			1
the candidates ' names appeared in @entity33 , while the rest of the information -- instructions on how to fill out the ballot			0
race names -- was in a language foreign to most			0
it 's no fault of @entity21 's			0
in some ways , it 's a creative solution			0
( @entity8 , where everyone is a racial minority , offers voting info in four languages , including @entity3 )			1
" some people were able to submit their votes for the races they wanted to vote for on these foreign - language ballots , " he said , " but it was just a mess , man			1
" in all , 69 precincts in @entity8 saw ballot shortages on @entity63 and 23 of those ran out of ballots entirely , according to the state election office 's spokesman			1
these issues were n't unique to @entity8			1
" we saw lines four or five hours long -- and even longer " in several states , said @entity69 , spokeswoman for @entity70 , a group that advocates for " open , honest and accountable government			1
" in @entity76 , she said , nine voting machines broke at one precinct , leaving only one to accommodate the masses			2
none of these mishaps resulted in another hanging chads fiasco , a @entity82 2000 , but that 's beside the point			0
the scariest thing about the long lines and other such headaches is that they discourage people from voting -- now and , potentially , well into the future			1
at a time when so much energy in this country is spent on trying to prevent voter fraud , we should turn more of our attention to the experience of people who want to vote , play by the rules , and ca n't because it 's simply too difficult			2
@entity21 told me 200 to 300 people left his precinct on tuesday without voting because of the long lines and the ballot shortage			1
it 's hard to blame them			0
in the modern world , as others have argued , who reasonably expects to wait in a line for more than an hour for anything ? the one exception is the @entity115 , but i doubt even those bleary - eyed , gadget - obsessed people would wait several hours to vote			2
" there were older people who had a hard time standing out in the line , " @entity21 told me			2
" we tried to bring chairs to people , but we did n't have enough chairs			2
there were people hurting -- people 80 , 90 years old who were coming in to vote			2
people with walkers who were n't able to stand that long			1
" some precincts in @entity8 that ran out of ballots were those that nonpartisan volunteers like @entity131 devoted his weekends to canvassing , encouraging people to participate			1
" to me , it 's kind of sad , " said @entity131 , who was a nonvoter into his 30s until a website asked him to make a pledge to vote			0
" you put in all this effort to try to get people to turn out ( to vote ) , and then they have this kind of experience			2
" those experiences perpetuate low voter turnout in @entity8 , he said			1
the state had the nation 's lowest turnout rate in 2008 , making it the focus of @entity0 's @entity152 project			2
( it 's still unclear whether the state finished in 49th or 50th place this year )			0
" there 's no reason why they should have run out of ballots , " he said			0
" i think it 's part of that attitude that perpetuates low voter turnout			0
' well , we do n't expect most people to vote			0
' that has to change from the state			0
because that goes back to the whole voting experience ... if you want to have more people vote , make it as easy as possible for them to vote			1
at least have everything there that they need to vote and make sure they have a good time doing it			0
( @entity8 's elections office ) just like totally messed that up			1
" the state election office does n't dispute that perspective			0
" our office made errors in the estimates of its allotment of ballots at the polling places in the general election , " said @entity180 , spokesman for the @entity181			1
" that 's the simplest explanation i can give you			0
" newly drawn voting districts and a miscalculation that only 25 % more people would vote in a presidential race than the primary contributed to the error , @entity180 said			1
there are some obvious solutions here , including bumping up the number of ballots polling places have on hand , as well as investigating what went wrong with backup plans			1
@entity180 said ballots or electronic voting machines were provided so that everyone who wanted to could still participate in the election , but one polling place , he said , stayed open two hours and 45 minutes late to accommodate people			1
" @entity63 is not a surprise			0
it does not sneak up on us , " said @entity69 , from @entity70			0
" you do n't wake up one day and say , ' hey , today we all vote ! ' it 's as simple as better planning			0
" better technology could also go a long way			0
as @entity69 pointed out , it 's impossible in 2012 to expect millions of voters to all go to the polls within a 24 - hour period			0
states , including @entity8 , should do more to encourage early walk - in voting and , eventually , electronic voting			1
people in @entity230 who were displaced by @entity231 were allowed this year to vote by e-mail			0
that 's not ready for prime time nationwide , but we should start investigating those options in a serious way			0
finally , a smarter -- or " modern , " as @entity69 put it -- voter registration system also would n't hurt			0
people in every state should be able to register to vote online , and a national system could make registration automatic when you sign up for other services			2
a nagging issue in @entity8 , though , still seems to be a lack of confidence in and respect for voters			1
if the state does n't provide enough ballots , why would someone stand in line ?			2

23 polling places in @entity8 ran out of ballots
state officials sent backups , but some people *reportedly* left without voting
@entity263 : long lines and missing ballots *undermine* the process
@entity8 says it *underestimated* the number of voters who would show up
