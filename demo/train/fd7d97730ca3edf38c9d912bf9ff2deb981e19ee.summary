-- if he was unknown to the @entity3 public before , @entity1 is fast becoming a household name , answering rapid - fire questions about the @entity7 oil spill in newspaper stories and television shows			1
on thursday , @entity11 's chief executive officer hit the airwaves again			1
this time , with a carefully crafted message of his own : " i 'm sorry			2
" " the @entity7 spill is a tragedy that never should have happened , " @entity1 says in commercials that began airing on national television			1
" ... @entity11 has taken full responsibility for cleaning up the spill in the @entity7 , " he says			1
" we 've helped organize the largest environmental response in this country 's history			2
more than 2 million feet of boom , 30 planes and over 1,300 boats are working to protect the shoreline			2
where oil reaches the shore , thousands of people are ready to clean it up			2
we will honor all legitimate claims			0
and our cleanup efforts will not come at any cost to taxpayers			0
" to those affected and your families , i am deeply sorry			0
the @entity7 is home for thousands of @entity11 's employees and we all feel the impact			1
to all the volunteers and for the strong support of the government , thank you			0
we know it is our responsibility to keep you informed			0
and do everything we can so this never happens again			0
we will get this done			0
we will make this right			2
" @entity1 makes the same apology in full - page ads appearing in major daily newspapers , including the @entity56 , the @entity57 , @entity58 and the @entity59			1
the ads are part of @entity11 's efforts to polish its tarnished image , but marketing experts are n't so sure anything will help just yet -- not with thousands of gallons of oil still gushing out of the ruptured @entity11 well			1
" at the end of the day , the best pr and advertising in the world can not compete with that live video stream of that oil coming out of the bottom of the sea , " @entity68 , a former oil company public relations man , told @entity70			0
" pr , advertising , community affairs , social media and communications is not going to solve the problem			0
" the beleaguered oil company 's apology is certainly not stopping angry @entity3 who plan to begin a week of demonstrations thursday in 50 cities nationwide			1
it also may be too late for residents of the @entity90 , who were already upset with @entity1 after he told reporters sunday that he " would like his life back " from the spill			1
fishermen and shop owners affected by the spill took issue with what they perceived as a whine from the millionaire businessman			2
so hayward issued yet another apology , this time on @entity11 's @entity103 page wednesday afternoon			1
" i made a hurtful and thoughtless comment on sunday when i said that ' i wanted my life back , ' " @entity1 said			1
" when i read that recently , i was appalled			0
i apologize , especially to the families of the 11 men who lost their lives in this tragic accident			0
" those words do n't represent how i feel about this tragedy , and certainly do n't represent the hearts of the people of @entity11 -- many of whom live and work in the @entity7 -- who are doing everything they can to make things right			1
my first priority is doing all we can to restore the lives of the people of the @entity7 region and their families -- to restore their lives , not mine			0
