-- attorney general @entity1 strode in to a raucously triumphant welcome at @entity4 headquarters on cold , sunny february morning in 2009 , less than a month after the inauguration of president @entity6			1
hundreds of staffers packed the stairwells and hallways , cheering loudly as he made his way , as he called it , back home			0
this was the department where he first started his career as a lawyer in the public corruption unit in 1976 , and where he has served 26 years , including as deputy attorney general in the @entity20 administration , and for a few days as acting attorney general under president @entity22			1
they mobbed him as he stood in the wood - paneled law library and gave an impromptu speech promising to turn the page from political scandals during the @entity22 administration			0
cheers rang out again after vice president @entity30 administered the oath of office and @entity1 vowed to return the department to " what it once was			1
" more than five years later , @entity1 is leaving the department , marking as his top accomplishments : the @entity4 's civil rights division , revising policies aimed at reducing the racial disparity in prison sentencing , and defending the use of federal civilian courts to try terrorists against a push by conservatives to use military courts at the @entity48 prison in @entity49 , @entity50			1
president @entity6 hailed @entity1 's role in the administration 's decision to stop defending the federal ban on recognizing same - sex marriages , which has opened the way to some of the most sweeping changes in gay rights			1

under his watch , the department also aggressively sought phone records of reporters in the hunt for national security leakers			0
that makes his record on civil liberties more complicated than his record on civil rights issues , critics argue			0
one of @entity1 's heroes is @entity79 , who used the @entity4 to push the agenda of civil rights			1
at the same time , @entity79 also signed off on @entity83 's invasive surveillance of civil rights @entity84 on suspicion of being a communist			0
at a @entity88 ceremony to announce his plan to step down president @entity6 called him " the people 's lawyer			0
" @entity1 's voice broke as he thanked the president for affording him " the greatest honor of my professional life			2
" the ceremony reflected the fact the attorney general 's own view that he is leaving on top , and after having grown to be a close friend to the president			1
he survived many trials , taking blows on the president 's behalf , as has become normal for the attorney general job in this highly - politicized era			1
his fights with congressional @entity109 left scars ; they made him the first sitting cabinet member to be held in contempt of @entity113			0
in recent months , @entity1 seized the opportunity to use his credibility on race issues by traveling to @entity117 , @entity118 , to try to ease tensions following the shooting of @entity121 , an 18 - year - old black man , by a white police officer			2
he launched an investigation of the police department , the latest in a string of such probes around the nation			0

@entity1 instead has overseen a push to bring civil cases that have wrung billions of dollars in settlements from some of the world 's biggest banks			2
@entity1 's defenders say that the criticism over civil liberties reflects the view of liberals who have set an impossible standard in an era with real national security threats from terrorism			1
in some ways , @entity1 's more cautious stance on national security programs came after he learned early in his tenure that turning away from @entity22 - era policies would be easier said than done			2
