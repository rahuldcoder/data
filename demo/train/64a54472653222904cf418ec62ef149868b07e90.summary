@entity0 -- this classic chant of " extra ! extra ! read all about it ! " -- barked out by battalions of newsboys hawking newspapers -- died decades ago , a casualty of home delivery , mass distribution and the advent of coin - operated newspaper machines			1
some coin - operated newspaper machines have lasted for 30 years , but lack of sales may force their retirement			1
but now as newspapers across the country wage a battle to survive in a market where readers are increasingly gravitating to the internet for information , the fate of another industry fixture seems inevitable			2
could those steel machines on street corners , distributing newspapers since the ' 50s , be headed for the scrap pile ? to begin to answer the question , all it takes is an early morning visit with a man who feeds those machines			1
it 's 5:30 a.m. on a saturday , and a white delivery truck for the @entity37 has just pulled into the parking lot outside the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity41			2
the driver -- @entity43 , who asked that his last name not be used -- is at one of his 130 stops on an eight - hour shift that began at midnight			0
@entity43 's job , which takes less than a couple of minutes per stop , entails filling the coin - operated machine with the day 's papers , collecting unsold copies and emptying the machine of its coins			1
even though @entity43 has a full schedule and lots of stops , it does n't equate to pushing as many papers as he once did			0
@entity43 loads 15 copies of the @entity37 into one machine -- and that 's a good load , he says			0
other locations receive only five to seven copies			0
he 's also tasked with filling machines for @entity67			2
though he 's been on this job for only two years , @entity43 has been on the route long enough to know business is down			1
he says newspapers sell better at train stations than from the street machines he services			1
the demise of newspapers across the country is getting a lot of front - page headlines			2
the @entity79 in @entity80 was just one of the most recent victims , ceasing print publication in march as declining circulation and plummeting advertising sales forced it to retrench and become just an online provider of journalism			0
even the legendary @entity88 will force readers to dig deeper for more coins as it raises prices june 1 , with the price of a paper going from $ 1.50 to $ 2			0
the publication that touts " @entity88 " has been relying less on newspaper racks			0
in 1999 , the @entity88 had 13,300 vending machines , but today that number has shrunk to 5,678 , according to @entity98 , spokeswoman for the @entity88			0
" one of the factors is home delivery , " @entity98 said , adding , " this was due to our national expansion -- where once many readers could only get copies from the newsstand or vending machine , they can now enjoy home delivery service			0
" but all the gloom - and - doom predictions that newspapers will one day disappear is n't scaring workers at the @entity112 , based in @entity113 , @entity114			1
the company lays claim to being the world 's largest manufacturer of coin - operated and no - charge newspaper vending machines			1
@entity120 is president and a fourth - generation member of a family business that began in 1898 manufacturing wire products			1
" there 'll be printed newspapers for years and years " said @entity120 , president of a company that is actually part of the larger @entity127			1
still , he concedes , " business is down about 25 to 30 percent from about five years ago			2
" it was n't until the late 1950s that the privately owned company was approached by the now defunct @entity134 newspaper to develop an early version of coin - operated newspaper machines			1
the early versions of newspaper machines were simple and made mostly of wire , but by the mid- 1960s they were all made of metal			1
the machines typically consist of a thick metal housing , shelves , doors and hinges			0
but the heart of any machine is the coin mechanism , which can have 150 moving parts , according to the manufacturer			0
some advanced models introduced in 1999 feature lithium batteries to run the coin - collecting mechanism			1
often weighing around 100 pounds , these hand - assembled machines cost on average $ 450 each , with refurbished models selling for around $ 300 , the company says			1
the zenith of the company 's business may have been the 1980s , when the introduction of @entity67 landed it a contract to build and deliver 100,000 coin - operated machines			1
today only 65,000 machines populate the nation 's sidewalks , according to a @entity67 spokesperson			2
in 1985 , @entity166 sold its 1 millionth newspaper machine and it has sold several hundred thousand since			0
its biggest clients have been the giants of newspaper publishing , including @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and the @entity175 newspaper groups			0
but the fate of those publishers directly affects the bottom line at @entity166			0
" business now ? it 's certainly slowed down , " said @entity120			2
" free publication racks ... we 've stayed fairly busy with those			0
coin - operated machines ? newspapers are cutting costs and pulling a lot of the racks from outlying areas			1
as a result this causes a surplus number of racks and then ultimately less of a need for new racks from us			0
" though the coin - operated machine business makes up 25 percent of the parent company 's overall business , @entity166 has learned to diversify and adapt			1
" we 're not dependent on any one industry , " @entity120 said			0
the company , which employs nearly 500 workers and occupies more than 500,000 square feet in a small rural town , also manufactures thousands of wire , tubing and sheet metal products			0
the average life span of a coin - operated newspaper machine depends on several factors			1
some machines , even with modest refurbishments every couple of years , have lasted for 30 years			2
for others it can be five minutes after an encounter with a snowplow			0
for the @entity112 , as long as newspapers are printed and sold , its machines will gladly continue to accept coins .			2

fewer customers *buy* from coin - operated newspaper machines
