-- a salty soup of seawater , microscopic pieces of plastic and marine debris			1
those are the ingredients in the @entity7 , an ocean vortex estimated by @entity9 to be the size of @entity11 , contaminated with the floating detritus of our modern lives			1
the sheer size of the ocean area affected has been enough to catch public attention , but a number of concerned groups are aiming to capture more than that			0
@entity21 plans to find a way to scoop up the plastic waste and devise a way to turn it into a future fuel source			1
it 's a huge task , but led by innovator and environmentalist @entity28 , @entity21 has already embarked on a mission to the gyre			2
an august voyage onboard the @entity33 and @entity21 sailing ships was in partnership with @entity35			2
the crews returned with samples of the water from various locations in the gyre and the most immediate discovery was the pervasiveness of plastic material found at regular points over 3,500 miles			1
the most heavily polluted areas of surface water in the gyre contained six times more plastic than plankton biomass			0
@entity50 , or " ghost " nets , plastic crates and even toys were found by the crew			0
some items like plastic bottles had become impromptu homes to varieties of marine mollusc			0
as well as posing hazards to the oceans through toxic contamination and to sealife through ingestion or being trapped in nets , unnatural transport systems could allow invasive species to be introduced to different areas and upset delicate ecosystems			0
the project now counts scientists , innovators , sailors and environmentalists among its ranks , galvanized around a desire to clean up the @entity77 's plastic vortex			1
a further voyage next year hopes to gather more data and move closer to a practical solution to the ever increasing problem .			0

voyage to the @entity7 found plastic in the ocean over 3,500 miles
plastic vortex has large pieces of plastic and microscopic *fragments*
aim of voyage was to learn how to collect the waste and turn into fuel
@entity21 will embark on another mission next year
