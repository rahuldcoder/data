@entity0 -- an election year that was already bad for incumbents is turning out to be worse than they could have ever imagined			0
an avalanche of crises -- ranging from the killer ebola virus to @entity9 jihadists to a suddenly volatile stock market -- is making it virtually impossible for lawmakers to rely on the inherent advantages of holding office			0
instead of highlighting their accomplishments to constituents , incumbents are on defense			1
the growing troubles are upending plans for the final stretch before the nov. 4 election that will determine which party will control the @entity24			0
president @entity25 was forced this week to scrap several campaign appearances to remain in @entity0 to oversee the @entity28 response			1
the weeks before an election are often volatile but the challenges in this election cycle are particularly acute			0
" other midterms have taken place in chaotic times , " said @entity32 , a professor of history at @entity34			0
" right now this is a pretty bad one			0
there are , rationally , a lot of problems that the president and the country are confronting			0
" @entity44 , a veteran @entity45 consultant in @entity46 , said the pain of current @entity49 lawmakers reminded him of the " six - year itch " election when @entity53 's unpopularity meant a " thumpin " for his party			1
" october 2014 is starting to remind me of october 2006 , which in my professional time was the worst cycle for @entity45 , and the best for @entity49 , " @entity44 said			1
back then , @entity53 's republicans -- like @entity25 's @entity49 -- could n't catch a break			1
powerless in the face of the sectarian explosion engulfing @entity63 , and scarred by @entity64 , @entity53 limped into the elections and @entity49 marched off with the @entity24 and the @entity66			2
today , democrats in tough elections do n't want to be seen with @entity25 and @entity24 candidate @entity69 wo n't even say if she voted for the president			1
the gloomy october is making it easier for @entity45 to press their case against @entity25 and incumbent @entity49			1
" this administration could n't run the @entity78 right , and it apparently is n't running the @entity79 right , " @entity74 told @entity76 's @entity76 - 1 television station on wednesday " and you ask yourself what is it going to take to have a president who really focuses on the interests of the @entity87 people ? " @entity89 warnings about the threat from @entity28 and the administration 's response have been percolating on conservative talk radio for weeks			1
but it took the infection of two nurses to insert the issue into the midterms			0
in a @entity101 @entity24 debate on wednesday , @entity45 rep. @entity99 demanded action amid @entity45 calls for a travel ban covering the epicenter of @entity28 in @entity106			1
" if the president is not willing to put into a place a travel ban , then we should have 100 percent screening of the people who are coming from those affected areas , " @entity99 said			0
@entity49 sen. @entity114 , trailing @entity99 in the @entity116 state , hit back by accusing his opponent of complicity in budget cuts for the @entity79			2
potential @entity45 2016 challengers are also pitching in , despite @entity25 's assurances that the chances of catching @entity28 are " extraordinarily " low			1
" the @entity25 administration has downplayed how transmissible it is , " senator @entity123 said in an interview with @entity1 thursday			2
" if someone has @entity28 at a cocktail party , they 're contagious and you can catch it from them			2
" in an article for @entity1 , @entity132 laid out " 5 steps to beat @entity28			2
" " this challenge will only be made more difficult because many @entity87 lack confidence in our government 's ability to effectively confront crises like this one , " he said			0
few charges are as damaging for a president as the sense he has lost control and the cascade of dramas over the last six weeks or so has often left the @entity149 struggling to catch up			0
the multiple crises have also played into a critique that the president is too passive and reacts to , rather than dictates , events			2
there is also trouble for the @entity149 abroad in the run - up to the mid-terms and @entity45 also see an opening against @entity25 and incumbent @entity49 in the fight against @entity9			1
in one spot , @entity76 senatorial candidate @entity161 warned " radical @entity164 terrorists are threatening to cause the collapse of our country			0
president @entity25 and @entity169 seem confused about the nature of the threat			1
" meanwhile , stock market losses complicate @entity49 attempts to highlight what good economic news there is out there — including increasingly robust jobs growth and a dip in the unemployment rate to 5.9 percent , the lowest level in six years			2
but despite being in the box seat in most @entity24 races , republicans are hardly basking in popularity — a fact encouraging to @entity49 as 2016 looms			0
the @entity45 brand is also battered , following gridlock in @entity188 and a government shutdown last year , and the unfinished tussle between the establishment and the @entity192			0
" the story of the @entity45 under @entity25 , no matter how many problems the president faces , is that they have consistently managed to shoot themselves in the foot , " said @entity32 , who is also a @entity1 contributor .			1

incumbents are playing defense as *domestic* and overseas crises mount .
president @entity25 had to cancel *fundraisers* this week to oversee the @entity28 response .
gloomy october makes it easier for @entity45 to make their case against @entity49 .
