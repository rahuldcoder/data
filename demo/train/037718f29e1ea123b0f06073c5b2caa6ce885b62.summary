@entity0 -- a court in @entity0 sentenced two men wednesday to 15 years in prison for the rape and kidnapping of a 15 - year - old @entity8 boy			1
@entity9 , mother of the 15 - year - old @entity8 - @entity11 teen , speaking outside a court in @entity0			1
the boy 's mother , @entity9 , was visibly upset after the sentence was read and promised to appeal			2
@entity16 , a @entity8 journalist , brought the case to the media 's attention in recent months in an effort to shed light on what she deemed to be injustices in the @entity26 emirate of @entity0			1
@entity16 said wednesday 's sentence was too lenient for a crime that she believes is tantamount to attempted murder because one of her son 's attackers was knowingly @entity34 - positive at the time of the rape			1
she refrained from asking the death penalty for her son 's attackers , but said she hoped the sentence would be much longer			2
a spokesman for the @entity0 government , @entity43 , told @entity1 the sentence was in accordance with international standards and was not lenient			1
" today 's verdict has proven that the system is efficient and is fair to all parties involved , " @entity43 said			0
the case began in july , when the two men , 36 and 18 , kidnapped and raped the @entity8 teenager at knifepoint			1
@entity16 contacted @entity8 diplomats , who took up the allegations with @entity0 authorities			1
@entity56 said police action was swift and arrests were made within 24 hours			0
but @entity16 has said the case was botched from the start , beginning with her son 's examination by a doctor who said her son was gay			2
homosexuality in @entity0 is illegal , and the teen could have faced as much as a year in prison			1
@entity16 's son has since returned to @entity8 and was not in court for wednesday 's sentencing			1
@entity16 has also said @entity0 authorities repeatedly concealed evidence -- confirmed in court papers -- that one of the attackers was @entity34 - positive			1
@entity16 said her son , who is still awaiting test results to find out whether he has the virus , could have gotten treatment much sooner had they known			0
@entity0 authorities deny any evidence was concealed			2
the case has shed light on @entity0 's attitudes toward rape and homosexuality , which some @entity88 observers have said is outdated			1
@entity56 , however , said wednesday 's sentencing and the government 's handling of the case proves the country 's system works			0
" it 's today 's verdict which proves that there is a system , " @entity43 said			0
" the system is working properly			0
however , if there is any room for any improvement in the system , we 'll definitely look into it , consider it , and if there 's any room for improvement , we 'll implement it			0
" the mother has already filed suit in courts in @entity113 and @entity114 , @entity11 seeking compensation from @entity116 , president of the @entity118 , and the prime minister and vice president of @entity0 , @entity121			2
she is also suing others , including the @entity0 police chief			2
@entity16 started a web site over the summer , @entity125 , demanding better treatment for children who suffer sexual assault there			0
at a press conference last month , she proclaimed , " we are here because i just would like first justice for my son ; and second for every girl and boy who was raped and even had no chance to speak			0
" @entity16 said she will drop all her pending cases if the government sets up rape clinics , recognizes the status of rape victims , and takes precautions after rape against sexually - transmitted diseases			2
in the wake of wednesday 's verdict , @entity16 said a @entity0 government official told her the emirate plans to open its first rape clinic , which she said was a small victory			1
the government has not yet officially announced its plans to open such a facility			0
@entity56 told @entity1 that @entity0 believes a reception center for rape victims is " a good solution			1
" " we are considering it , " he said , regarding @entity16 's request			0
" we believe it 's good			0
it 's good for the victims , and it 's good for the whole system			0
" e-mail to a friend @entity1 correspondent @entity166 contributed to this report .			0
