-- the kind of sinkhole that suddenly opened up under a @entity4 home is more common than you might think			1
let 's take a look at what causes them , where they happen and just how dangerous and costly they can be : what causes sinkholes ? many sinkholes form when acidic rainwater dissolves limestone or similar rock beneath the soil , leaving a large void that collapses when it 's no longer able to support the weight of what 's above , whether that be an open field , a road or a house			0
these are called " cover - collapse sinkholes , " and it would appear this is what 's happening in @entity4 , where the ground beneath the home suddenly gave way			2
where do they happen ? sinkholes are particularly common in @entity4 , which rests on a nearly unbroken bed of limestone , according to the @entity40			1
@entity4 , including the @entity42 area , is particularly known for sinkholes			2
in fact , @entity43 , where thursday 's collapse occurred , is known as part of @entity4 's so - called @entity47 , where two - thirds of insurance claims for sinkhole damage occur , according to a report prepared for state lawmakers in 2010			1
other places that frequently see sinkholes include @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61 , the @entity53 says			0
do all sinkholes collapse so dramatically ? no , some merely cause the ground above to sag , or result in small ponds or saltwater marshes , the @entity62 says			0
how often do they happen ? there do not appear to be any solid numbers , but the @entity4 @entity69 on @entity70 reported that insurers had received 24,671 claims for sinkhole damage in that state alone between 2006 and 2010			1
that 's an average of nearly 17 claims a day , just in @entity4			2
how dangerous and costly are sinkholes ? deaths and injuries from sinkholes are rare , but certainly not unheard of			0
for instance , in 2012 , a 15 - year - old girl died when her family 's car fell into a @entity85 sinkhole , according to media accounts			0
but the holes are enormously costly			0
insurance claims submitted in @entity4 alone between 2006 and 2010 totaled $ 1.4 billion , according the @entity4 @entity69 report .			1
