millionaires are ready for @entity1			2
according to a @entity4 survey , @entity1 -- with 31 % support -- would be the top choice for people with " investable assets of $ 1 million or more " if the 2016 election were held today			1
@entity9 is followed by former @entity10 gov. @entity10 with 18 % , @entity12 gov. @entity11 with 14 % and @entity14 independent sen. @entity13 with 11 %			1
in the poll , @entity4 notes that " people with investable assets of $ 1 million or more " make up the top 8 % of @entity17 households and their poll was " evenly split between @entity19 , @entity10 and @entity20			1
" among @entity19 , @entity9 's lead is massive , with 72 % of the 500 people polled stating they support the former first lady			0
@entity10 , likewise , is the top choice for @entity10 millionaires with 36 % support			1
despite the fact that millionaire supporters have outsized influence because of campaign contributions and donations to super @entity34 , this distinction could be one @entity9 does n't want			0
since she last ran 0for president , the @entity19 has become more populist and in order to win in 2016 , many political experts see her needed to reconnect with middle and working class voters			2
the party has also been overtaken by skepticism of @entity42 and , in some cases , wealth , meaning having the backing of a majority of millionaires may not be a badge of honor in 2016			2
what 's more , the support of more millionaires has not always been indicative of electoral success			0
in 2008 and 2012 , republicans @entity54 and @entity56 had support of most millionaires in their respective elections			0
both went on to lose to president @entity61 , who had the support of most people with $ 30 million or more .			0

a new poll finds 31 % of millionaires would vote for @entity1 if the 2016 election were held today
former @entity10 gov. @entity10 is the top @entity10 with 18 %
with a more populist @entity19 , this might not be a badge of honor for @entity1
