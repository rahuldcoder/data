, there might be more of a connection than one would think			1
in an interview last month with @entity11 , @entity3 revealed his influences this time around included @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
and indeed , he does seem to be slanting that way , at least in terms of producers			1
on 2010 's " illuminations , " he worked with the rap / hard rock producer @entity21 and on " @entity8 , " he teamed up with veteran rock producer @entity22 , whose credits include @entity24 and @entity25			1
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity3 from his home in @entity27 about his rock ' n ' roll habits past and present , why he sneaks into the crowd before he performs and his upcoming role on " csi : @entity33			1
" @entity0 : growing up , who were some of the rock bands that you loved ? @entity3 : growing up in a city like @entity27 , you have everything from the @entity39 to the @entity40 to see music , so i was really lucky that my parents were open - minded at a young age			1
they took me to see everything from @entity46 to the @entity47			1
i was lucky to be in middle - school during the grunge - rock era , which is one of the best decades for rock music			1
so i grew up listening to @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , that kind of thing			1
there was some epicness to that music			1
i also loved classic rock			1
i loved listening to groups like @entity65			1
i do n't know if it 's considered " rock , " but one of the albums that changed my life was @entity72 's " @entity71			2
" it blew my mind			2
i think that was the record that really showed me that that kind of experimentation and cross-pollination of sounds can be a brilliant thing			2
@entity0 : looking back , did you go through any embarrassing music phases ? @entity3 : i think we all go through questionable moments			1
but you know , they 're back on tour , so i can actually say it : my very first concert , in the third grade , was @entity91 at the @entity92			1
if you were a third - grader at that time , there was nothing bigger than @entity91			1
@entity0 : on your last record , you worked with @entity21 , and this record you worked with @entity22 , who worked with artists like @entity24 , @entity25 and the @entity100			2
do they bring an edge to your recordings ? @entity3 : i think they do			1
any time you work with a producer , there 's a sonic marriage that happens , where you 're going to provide everything from your world and they 're going to provide a real stamp of a sound that they tap into instinctively			2
whenever i said to him , " i 'm not sure i can get away with that , " he was the one to say to me , " no , this is naturally in you			2
we 'll know when we go too far			2
" @entity0 : is it crazy to think that knowing your way around a loud guitar could mimic what you do with your vocals ? @entity3 : not crazy at all			1
i make comparisons between rock singers and classical singers			2
... i do n't think there 's any different intent when @entity133 sings " we are the @entity135 " and @entity136 sings in " @entity137			2
" emotionally and cerebrally , you can be in the exact same headspace			2
that 's what 's interesting to me about quote - unquote crossover music			2
@entity0 : for the long - term @entity145 fan , what are they going to notice about this album ? @entity3 : this album , in my own humble opinion , is in equal parts a return to a certain style of form that i felt was a real sweet spot for me four or five years ago , but at the same time , there 's more of a willingness to explore new avenues than i ever have before			1
as i sit back and listen to the album again , i say to myself , " i think we really captured what we wanted to do : to not dumb down or compromise what i do vocally , but at the same time , i really pushed a lot of my boundaries			2
" @entity0 : on tour these days , do you have any rock star indulgences ? @entity3 : ( @entity167 ) i will tell you , many of the real rockers i know on tour , have the most zen , meditative , dare i say boring existence back stage			1
nowadays , i think the rock and roll thing is to not lose your voice on stage and to make sure your fans are happy			2
but my rock and roll indulgences are basically apple juice , lots of @entity182 water and sometimes i 'll put on a hat , hoodie and sunglasses and i 'll go out and feel what they crowd feels like			0
@entity0 : really ? @entity3 : just during the opening act			1
my thing is , i like to feel the energy of the room before i go out there			0
kind of plan my attack			0
for me , it 's not just about when the lights go down , it 's about the whole process			0
what does the room feel like ? what does the stage look like ? what was the ticket price ? you want everything to be an experience that makes them happy			0
if can feel whether there 's a buzz or a slight agitation			0
@entity0 : what 's interesting is that as record sales of rock music have declined , yours have been massive			0
is operatic pop the last frontier for successful musicians ? @entity3 : ( @entity167 ) it 's something i 've been scratching my head over			1
it 's sad for me to see so many record stores going under			0
i do n't think things are entirely digital			0
there 's a huge gap in how people buy their music			0
@entity227 is certainly the most convenient			0
part of it has to do whether or not you draw a line in the sand on whether you 're going to be a " single " artist or an " album " artist			0
i ca n't get away with releasing an album unless it 's the kind of album my fans want to listen to from beginning to end			0
i think the digital world has gotten people used to picking and choosing what they deem to be the hit and disposing of the rest			0
and i think that can be really dangerous			0
@entity0 : last year , we saw you cast on " @entity249 " as @entity251 's brother			0
will you reprise that role as the series winding down ? @entity3 : i have n't been on set			1
i have n't been asked			0
i think it may have run its course			0
that happened so on a whim			0
i got a @entity262 message from @entity263 and she said " hey , i got a crazy idea , it would be really funny if you could stop by			0
" i just happened to be playing @entity265 the night before , so i went off stage , went home , got as much sleep as i could and showed up set the next morning at 5 a.m. i think it turned into something more than i expected it to			0
@entity0 : you 're also slated to appear in an upcoming comedy called " @entity274 , " alongside " it 's @entity276 in @entity278 's " @entity277			1
what 's your character like ? @entity3 : kind of a slacker , a failed @entity283 guy who 's a barista at a coffee shop who has an ongoing feud with @entity277 , @entity288 ( " @entity291 " ) and @entity289 ( " @entity290 " )			1
they basically come in there every day as their " clerks " style , hang and steal my free @entity297 by taking one sip every 20 minutes			0
it was fun to play that tattooed , d --- - e-baggy type			0
@entity0 : do you have any other acting gigs lined up ? @entity3 : there 's a really fun cameo i 'm about to make in a film that i wish i could tell you about , but they 've sworn me to secrecy			1
i 'm doing a cameo in " csi : @entity33 , " as myself			0
i 'm just going to play " happy in my heartache " from the new album in their @entity314 's episode			0
not going to be a corpse , thankfully .			0
