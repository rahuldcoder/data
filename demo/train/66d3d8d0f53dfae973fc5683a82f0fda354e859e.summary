editor 's note : @entity2 was special counsel and adviser to president @entity4			1
@entity2 says the @entity5 are not @entity7 royalty , but have dedicated themselves to service			1
@entity9 ( @entity10 ) -- with the death of @entity4 's brother , senator @entity13 , and their sister , @entity14 , the founder of the @entity16 for the developmentally challenged , there has been a wealth of news stories -- obituaries and otherwise -- about the recurring tragedies endured by what some call @entity7 's " royal family			1
" all of these comments are well intended but off the mark			0
the @entity5 have been a remarkable family since its founding roughly a century ago by @entity30 and @entity31			2
but , its members have never asked for pity or privilege			0
their history has emphasized more success than tragedy			0
their love of family and country stood out during some of the most cynical and selfish periods in recent @entity7 history			1
like any large family , particularly one which deservedly remained in the public eye for many decades , a large number of afflictions and setbacks , also in the public eye , was unavoidable			1
nevertheless , the members of that family have never considered themselves " royal " or entitled to special privileges			2
we have no royalty in @entity7 , but ever since the @entity61 family sent several generations to public service in the earliest days of our nationhood , other families have demonstrated similar interests and commitments to public service			1
the @entity5 were taught as children and genuinely believed that @entity7 citizenship was a special privilege and honor , in return for which every citizen had an obligation to serve and help the country			2
even the youngest generation of @entity5 today acts not out of a sense of entitlement but a sense of commitment			0
from the beginning , those members of the family who held or sought public office had the courage to take public positions on controversial issues , not always approved by the leaders of their party , church or respective constituencies			1
nevertheless , they stood up and spoke out for what they believed was right , regardless of political and personal consequences			2
in short , they have had a proud tradition of becoming -- not merely writing about -- profiles in courage			0
as the result of the elder @entity101 's success in business , many of his descendants could have lived lives of luxury and ease			0
after all , they liked family fun , in the sun , on the water , sometimes competing with as well as teasing each other			0
yet , they devoted and donated more of their valuable time than most families to the service of others , their country , their communities , and those who did not have their good fortune , good education and good opportunities to lead			1
president @entity4 was their star , their pride , their model and their leader			1
but his siblings , @entity129 , @entity13 , @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 all played their own special roles , making their own special contributions throughout their lives			0
this country has long been a wealthy country , with all its wealth of brilliant and devoted leaders and traditional ideals			0
but it would have been a much poorer country without the @entity5			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : *people* have *focused* on the tragedies endured by @entity4 family
he says focus should be on how family has been dedicated to public service
@entity2 : their love of family and country stood out in a selfish era
