democrats in key @entity2 races are showing some strength in the final stretch of election season -- but it may not be enough to keep the chamber			1
a new @entity10 / @entity9 poll released friday shows democrat @entity11 leading @entity13 @entity12 47 % to 44 % among likely voters			1
a wafb poll out this week in @entity16 found incumbent @entity19 @entity18 four points ahead of @entity13 @entity20			1
and a recent @entity23 / @entity22 poll in @entity24 found democrat @entity25 trailing @entity26 leader @entity26 by just one point			2
it 's enough to make @entity0 feel cautiously optimistic about their ability to hold onto the @entity2			0
but there 's a problem : in two of the races -- @entity34 and @entity16 -- democrats will need to win at least 50 % of the vote to avoid a runoff			1
and neither candidate is clearing that threshold in polls			2
democrats could upend @entity13 hopes of picking up the net gain of six seats needed to claim the @entity2 if they find a way to succeed in these races without a runoff			1
the good news - bad news scenario is reflected in today 's @entity34 poll			1
" it is a surprising show of strength for a @entity19 in a state in which no @entity19 has won a statewide election in over a decade , " said @entity10 polling director @entity52			0
@entity0 and @entity13 consultants credit @entity11 , daughter of former senator @entity58 , with running a strong campaign			0
she gained momentum in recent weeks by slamming one of former ceo @entity12 's supposed strengths : his business record , and accused him of shipping @entity65 jobs overseas			0
the @entity10 poll also shows @entity11 beating @entity12 51 % to 47 % in a run - off election that will take place on jan. 6 if neither candidate wins in the first round			2
the data , however , is based on those likely to vote in november and the electorate in run - off elections typically differs from first round votes			0
as @entity11 inches closer to the 50 % threshold , her fate could lie with libertarian candidate @entity79 , who is polling at 5 % of likely voters			1
no one knows whether @entity83 's supporters will gravitate to @entity12 or simply stay home -- and their decision could have big implications for who wins the race			0
an idiosyncratic election system is also a problem for democrats in @entity16 , where sen. @entity18 led the last five polls ahead of the state 's open primary , which will send two candidates to a run - off if no one wins 50 % of the vote			1
an outright win is eluding @entity18			2
though she 's ahead of @entity20 , recent polls show her garnering only support in the high 30 % to low 40 % range			1
even worse for @entity18 , when voters are asked if they plan to vote for @entity18 in the run - off , she trails @entity20 by between three and nine percent			0
@entity105 , a political science professor at @entity106 , said @entity18 has seen her state rapidly trend more @entity13 since she won the seat for the first time in 1996 , and says a run - off may be one step too far for her			0
" i think that her support is probably around 42 or 43 percent , " @entity105 said			0
the runoffs will be even more crucial if the results determine control of the @entity2			0
such a scenario would unleash a torrent of national attention , campaign cash and duels by top party surrogates , which could produce cliffhanger election nights weeks after voters go to the polls in november .			2

candidates in @entity16 and @entity34 must win 50 % to win a runoff
democrats in those states are ahead in some polls but have *n't* cleared 50 %
