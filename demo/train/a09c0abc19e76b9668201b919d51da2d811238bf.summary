-- two young men , a bunch of subordinates , one master plan : take over the drug trade at some of @entity8 's best schools			2
authorities announced tuesday that they were able to foil this ambitious effort -- unearthing marijuana , hash oil , cocaine , ecstasy ( or @entity15 , its active ingredient ) as well as cash and several weapons -- and arrest the pair allegedly at the center of it , among others			1
" they were in business to make money , and they were going to do whatever they needed to do to make sure that no one threatened their business , " @entity24 district attorney @entity23 said			1
she was speaking primarily of the main suspects , 25 - year - old @entity35 and 18 - year - old @entity36 , behind what they allegedly called the " @entity38 " -- the @entity39 referring to a group of affluent towns and cities outside @entity43			1
officials claim @entity35 helmed the operation , including shipping large amounts of marijuana from @entity48 to @entity8 , while @entity36 supervised sub-dealers at area high schools			1
and these were n't just any schools			1
they include the prestigious @entity54 , from which both @entity35 and @entity36 graduated			2
they had ties to its lacrosse program			0
the public high schools of @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 -- each of which have some of the highest sat scores in @entity8 -- were also part of the ring , according to the district attorney 's office			1
so , too , were nearby @entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72			0
in brief comments tuesday , @entity35 's lawyer @entity73 said his client 's " main concern ... is how the mandatory minimums are going to operate if he 's indeed guilty of the offenses			0
" @entity80 , @entity36 ' attorney , spoke more extensively regarding his client , who went to the @entity82 in 2013 on a lacrosse scholarship then left after one semester			2
he said @entity36 had gotten injured , after which he was at home , " idle and suffering from some depression " when he got involved with @entity35 " at a very susceptible , low point in his life			0
" " he 's willing to accept responsibility for what he did , " @entity80 said of @entity36 , whom he said " was involved in this conspiracy for a very , very short period of time			0
" in a news conference and release , authorities laid out what they described as an elaborate operation to build up business			1
this effort included things like offering incentives to sub-dealers , such as lower drug prices and being able to buy them on credit			2
including @entity35 and @entity36 , eight people have been arrested in the case , an arrest warrant is out on another , and there are petitions for two juveniles			0
all but two of those arrested attended local schools such as @entity119 , the @entity54 and local public high schools			1
they face a host of drug , criminal conspiracy and other charges			0
reflecting on the areas where this alleged drug scheme operated , @entity125 -- the district attorney for @entity43 , which is near the schools in question -- said in a press release , " the days of , ' it ca n't happen here ' are long gone			1
" the arrests follow an investigation that began in january			0
authorities say seized text messages showed the suspects ' plans to expand the business , with @entity35 giving @entity36 business advice on how to expand marijuana sales in local high schools and @entity36 encouraging sub-dealers to " efficiently distribute drugs at their schools , " @entity23 's office said			1
authorities assert the discovery of a loaded .223 caliber @entity149 assault rifle , in addition to a semi-automatic pistol and another rifle , suggest the drug ring 's leaders had the capability to use force			2
@entity23 admitted she 's bothered by the fact @entity35 -- who left @entity158 after three semesters of study after being sanctioned for using marijuana and creating fake ids -- and @entity36 both attended @entity71 , then allegedly did what they did			0
" you 're dealing with kids from one of the finest institutions probably in the country , " she said			0
" to take those skills and turn it into this kind of illegal enterprise is very distressing			0
" @entity176 's worker 's @entity174 had a bit extra : heroin former @entity180 sergeant conspired in drug trade ' @entity182 arrested in undercover drug bust @entity184 : @entity185 ran drug ring that grossed $ 20,000 a month			2
