-- it 's not as fancy as an @entity2 , but it 's far more affordable : @entity4 's july 25 circular advertised a 7 - inch tablet by @entity6 running the @entity8 operating system			1
the @entity9 is on sale through july 31 for $ 149.99			1
that 's far less than the cost of a laptop computer , and significantly less than the cost of a typical netbook			1
it 's even less than the up - front cost for many popular carrier - subsidized smartphones -- and it does n't require a pricey monthly contract			1
in fact , this device is roughly the size and cost of the @entity25 version of the latest @entity26			0
it 's small enough to carry in a purse , and light enough to hold up easily if you 're lying down in bed to read			2
all of this puts the @entity33 in a very interesting market position			0
it 's a net - enabled tablet that is truly affordable for a mass consumer audience			1
in this unboxing video , @entity39 user @entity37 compares the @entity8 tablet to his @entity2 and notes that while the @entity2 functions more smoothly and has a more compelling display , you can buy three @entity33 tablets ( and then some ) for the price of the least expensive @entity2 model			1
this tablet certainly has some shortcomings			2
according to @entity52 's video , the touchscreen is plastic ( not glass ) and requires a much firmer touch than the @entity2			0
it even comes with a stylus , which seems like a technological throwback			0
furthermore , the @entity8 operating system may not be as intuitive as the @entity60 -- although it probably is not more difficult than @entity61 , which has been the choice of cost - conscious computer users for decades			1
the big deal is : devices like this -- and rest assured , there will be many more of them -- can help address the class biases of technology and bridge the digital divide			0
tablets like the @entity74 could become popular among people who have never owned a computer , or who own a computer and just want light web access on the go			1
i could see them becoming popular with teens and students , with seniors ( who often feel overwhelmed by learning a computer ) , or anyone who wants more than an e-reader but less than a netbook as long as it 's inexpensive			1
i also could see this kind of device catching on among businesses and organizations where people must walk around while recording or accessing information			0
i could envision cost - conscious shoppers opting to meet their communication needs via a small @entity25 tablet plus a no - contract , simple - feature phone -- and not feeling left behind by the smartphone craze			1
i 'm sure that some people who are accustomed to laptops and smartphones will scoff at the @entity9 and its inevitable successors as underpowered cheap toys			1
they 're not the target market			0
the target market , i think , is people who just want good - enough , easy internet access for the lowest cash outlay			2
that 's a big market -- one that probably includes people who would n't ever purchase a computer , netbook , or smartphone			1
the catch , of course , is @entity25 access -- which is still far from ubiquitous in many areas			0
it 's is often available for free at schools , libraries , and many kinds of businesses ; but it 's a bigger hurdle for people in rural or poor communities			2
so far , tablets ( even the @entity2 ) are mainly intended for media consumption , simple interaction , and light content creation or curating			0
they are n't good for writing a book , manipulating a big spreadsheet or editing a podcast			0
but they are good enough to allow considerably more people to do considerably more online , affordably , and with fewer obstacles than most phones present			0
at the moment , the @entity9 is not actually on @entity4 's shelves			1
the retailer is issuing rain checks for this offer			0
( see the @entity4 blog for details			0
) and it 's unknown what @entity4 's price for the tablet will be after july 31			2
but remember , this particular product is just a starting point			0
it 'll be interesting to watch this market develop -- and to see how people put these cheap tablets to use .			2
