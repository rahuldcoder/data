one year ago this month , @entity1 's leader @entity0 released a video announcing a new , reprehensible front in its bloody attempt at forced @entity6 : his fighters will begin abducting girls and selling them			1
the kidnappings , he said , were retaliation for @entity12 security forces nabbing the wives and children of group members			1
and for 12 months , the radical militant group has done just that -- with @entity12 treating the sporadic kidnappings with disgust but resignation			1
but that 's changed now			2
" when this first happened ... what i was hearing from my friends and from other people was like , ' why do i care ? @entity12 is done			1
@entity12 is going to disintegrate , ' " said @entity27 , whose father was kidnapped in @entity12 in an unrelated incident			1
" i refused to believe that , " he said			2
" we ca n't let this be the new normal			0
" here are six reasons why the @entity1 abductions , the repugnant message its leader released this week , and @entity12 's inadequate response should matter to the rest of the world			1
terrorism is n't isolated just imagine if 276 girls had been kidnapped in the @entity41			1
the response would be mass outrage and a forceful demand for a response			1
as borders become more irrelevant for terrorists , the whole world needs to take notice of the likes of @entity1			1
" we need to take ownership as if this happened in @entity55 or this happened in @entity57 , " said @entity51 , outgoing president of the @entity52			1
" we need to be talking about this			0
... we need to make sure our own government is helping in any way that we can			0
" what the @entity1 has set out to do in @entity63 's most populous nation is as heinous as the havoc the @entity64 is wreaking			1
" they actually originated as a group called the @entity12 @entity64 , which kind of explains where they 're coming from , " said @entity2 's national security analyst @entity66			1
" they are aiming to impose @entity64 - style rule on much of @entity12 , particularly in the north where they are based			0
" the group 's name itself means " @entity77 education is sinful " in the local @entity79 language			1
its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of @entity83 law			0
the group especially opposes the education of women			1
under its version of @entity83 law , women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands , not at school learning to read and write			1
then consider its ties to @entity96			0
how closely related @entity1 is to @entity96 is hard to define , but the @entity41 says it has links			1
" @entity98 , which is the @entity99 affiliate , has given money to @entity1 in the past , " @entity66 said			1
" there is reporting suggesting that @entity102 was in communication with the leadership of this group			2
" @entity27 put it succinctly			0
" people are thinking , this does n't affect my country , but i 'm telling them terrorists ... did n't just wake up one morning and decide to become terrorists , " he said			0
" these guys , it takes years for them to decide to go out there and commit these atrocities			0
so as the world , we have to come together and try to find a solution to this problem			0
" the @entity41 is so concerned about @entity121 terrorism in @entity12 that the @entity122 released a warning last week to @entity41 traveling within and to @entity12 that " groups associated with terrorism " may be planning an attack in @entity125 , the country 's commercial center , @entity66 said			1
the inhumane treatment of children concerns us all the terrorists raided the girls ' school in the middle of the night , posing as soldiers			1
after a gunfight with security guards , they stormed the students ' dormitory and herded the girls into vehicles			2
as they made their escape , the militants burned down nearby buildings in the northern town of @entity146			0
the girls disappeared into the night			2
even worse are fears of what will happen to the girls next			2
the new video from the purported leader of @entity1 detailed this chilling plan : " i abducted your girls			1
i will sell them in the market , by @entity162 , " said a man claiming to be @entity1 leader @entity0 in the video first obtained by @entity159			1
if the claim proves true , the 276 teen girls could become child brides or sex slaves			2
rights groups have said @entity1 has kidnapped girls as young as 12			1
and the abductions are only getting worse			0
in the first two months of this year alone , @entity1 kidnapped at least 25 girls and women , according to @entity172			1
in november , the militant group abducted dozens of christian girls and women , most of whom were later rescued by the military deep in a forest in @entity180			1
at the time of their rescue , some were pregnant or had children , and others had been forcibly converted to @entity186 and married off to their kidnappers			0
the parents ' hands are tied any parent can only imagine the horror of a child getting kidnapped			2
now multiply that by 276 and add the fear of a volatile terrorist group			2
families of some of the kidnapped girls are petrified of speaking to the media for fear of retribution against their daughters			1
" many of the parents feel if there is even ( any ) kind of movement from their end , they could see the children killed , " @entity2 's @entity12 - based correspondent @entity204 said			0
" the parents told us , over the course of the last three weeks , they themselves have risked their own lives trying to go in armed with machetes , sticks and rocks to do the job they say the @entity12 military is unwilling to do			2
" it 's the price they pay for daring to send their girls to school despite threats from @entity1			1
the kidnapped girls were from @entity228 , where 72 % of primary - age children have never attended school , according to the @entity231 in @entity12			1
@entity27 said he knows what the parents are going through			0
his father was abducted in @entity12 four years ago while returning home from work			2
" you ca n't sleep			0
" to this day , @entity27 said , he can still hear the cries of his family members			0
" so i really feel for these mothers that lost their daughters			0
it 's -- i ca n't -- you ca n't really begin to understand what they are going through until you 're in that situation			0
" @entity27 's father was shot and almost died			0
he was released only after the family paid a ransom			0
what happens in @entity12 has deeper repercussions @entity12 boasts @entity63 's largest economy			0
but internal problems can have a ripple effect far and wide			0
@entity12 militant activity has already spilled over to neighbors such as @entity260 , whose government has warned that clerics have been recruiting members in mosques in the country , said @entity266 , a former governor of @entity12 's @entity267			2
" in this era of accelerating globalization , it appears @entity1 hopes to align itself with extremist forces in @entity272 , @entity273 and potentially in the @entity274 , which raises the specter of coordination on the stockpiling of munitions , intelligence gathering and future assaults , " @entity266 said			1
the @entity12 response has been feeble two days after the kidnappings , the @entity12 military said all but eight of the girls were free			2
that turned out to be untrue , prompting the father of one of the abducted girls to say the government had gone from using " blatant propaganda " to telling " blatant lie			2
" for three weeks , president @entity293 said nothing			2
he has yet to visit the region			0
and when he did begin speaking about the abductions , he criticized the parents for not cooperating with the police , for not sharing information			0
" it 's been awful , frankly , " said @entity300 of the @entity12 government 's response			0
@entity300 is the deputy director and fellow for the @entity63 program at the @entity57 - based @entity306			0
" these girls were taken in the middle of last month and really it was not until last night that we had the first lengthy comments from the president , which lends credence to this allegation that the government is not sufficiently invested in this crisis , " @entity300 said monday			2
add to that the comments @entity293 's wife reportedly made			0
" @entity320 , who is the first lady , called some of the mothers to her , to meet with her , and she basically told them that they really need to be quiet and they were really bringing shame and embarrassment to @entity12 , " said @entity319 , from the @entity52			0
" that 's certainly a problem			0
" this ca n't be business as usual with a @entity331 set to begin wednesday in the capital city of @entity333 , the @entity12 government is under mounting pressure to find and save the girls			2
the @entity41 government is offering to help , but said @entity12 must take the lead in finding the students			1
officials told @entity2 the @entity341 administration is sharing intelligence with @entity12 authorities and could provide other assistance , but there is no plan to send @entity41 troops			1
a group of @entity41 senators from both parties has introduced a resolution calling for the @entity41 to help the @entity12 government improve school security and go after @entity1			1
the resolution stops short of calling for sending @entity41 troops			1
instead , it urges " timely civilian assistance " from the @entity41 and allied @entity63 nations to help rescue the abducted students			1
rights groups are therefore heartened at the groundswell of support , with the globally trending hashtag # @entity362			0
crowds from @entity365 to @entity366 rallied over the weekend			0
" i think one of the most beautiful things that has happened is people are taking the hashtag , putting them in front of them and saying , ' bring back our girls , ' " @entity319 said			1
" i think people are doing that			0
" @entity2 's @entity377 , @entity378 , @entity379 , @entity380 , @entity381 , @entity382 , @entity383 and @entity384 contributed to this report .			0

the girls were kidnapped from school more than 3 weeks ago
the militant group @entity1 claims responsibility for the mass abduction
" @entity162 says i should sell " the girls , the @entity1 leader says
advocate : we need to treat this like it happened in the @entity41
