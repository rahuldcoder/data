@entity0 -- he 's brought bloodthirsty zombies , squalid junkies and murderous housemates to life on the big screen , but faced the toughest task of his career at @entity10 : bringing boogying nurses , bucolic scenes and butterflies on bicycles to a worldwide audience of a billion people			2
@entity17 , the @entity18 - winning director -- and east @entity0 resident -- best known for hit movies " @entity21 " and " @entity22 " was the man responsible for the @entity24 opening ceremony , the show that televisions around the world were tuned in to at the start of @entity0 's long - awaited games			1
and while those of his films set in @entity32 have painted a darkly comic picture of the country , " @entity39 " -- the " @entity36 " - inspired extravaganza which kicked off the @entity29 -- proved much more of a celebration of the nation			1
live blog : let the games begin a billion people across the globe tuned in for the three - hour , $ 42.4m show , which featured 10,000 adult volunteers , 900 children , 12 horses , 10 chickens , nine geese , three cows and a flock of sheep			2
with an uplifting , " people power " theme combining references to @entity32 history and pop culture , the rambunctious ceremony covered subjects as diverse as the @entity60 , the @entity61 , popular children 's book characters including @entity64 and @entity65 , and pop stars past and present			2
it was well received in the @entity32 and abroad , drawing an average audience of 40.7 million people in the @entity70 , topping the previous record of 39.8 million for the @entity72			0
" the ceremony is an attempt to capture a picture of ourselves as a nation , where we have come from and where we want to be , " @entity17 explained in a statement in the run - up to the @entity29 , saying he hoped to tell the country 's story , with the help of a vast army of volunteers who , he said , " are the purest embodiment of the @entity24 spirit and represent the best of who we are as a nation			1
" " we have to celebrate all that is great about the past but also all the potential @entity32 has in the future , " said @entity32 prime minister @entity92			0
" the difficulty is how do you cram in all that is great about our country , whether it is sport , art , literature , history , contribution to world events			0
i 'm confident they have done a good job and there were one or two moments i was really moved by			0
there 's something for everyone			0
" opinion : is @entity114 's militaristic uniform a problem ? britons are known for their ability to laugh at themselves , and it appears @entity17 sought to capitalize on this -- as @entity120 noted recently , " opening ceremonies are a country 's opportunity to sell itself to the world			1
@entity32 appears to be selling irony			0
" @entity10 organizers say that @entity17 's experience , energy and unusual vision made him the perfect man for the job			1
" his ability as a storyteller , as a creator of spectacle , his background in both theater and film and the passion he has for this city and this project -- they all just screamed at us , " said @entity132 , director of ceremonies for the @entity29 , when @entity17 was appointed to the role			1
" it was n't a difficult choice			0
" " @entity17 gets this , " @entity10 chairman @entity150 told @entity1 back in 2010			1
" he gets the @entity24 , he gets sports , he lives in @entity0 , he 's a stone 's throw from the @entity155 , and it was just such an obvious fit			0
" it was not always thus : @entity17 , 55 , was born into a working - class family in @entity159 , northern @entity160 , the son of a power plant worker and a cafeteria employee , and as a child had hoped to become a catholic priest			1
but after a school trip to see a much - lauded @entity169 performance of " @entity170 , " and a visit to the cinema with classmates to see @entity175 's controversial " @entity174 , " his ambitions turned instead to film and theater			2
@entity17 studied @entity160 and drama at university , before working at the @entity169 and at @entity0 's innovative @entity180 , where he was deputy director in the 1980s			1
he moved into television , and then on to movies , making his big screen debut with " @entity184 , " the darkly humorous tale of three flatmates who discover a suitcase full of cash when their new lodger dies of a drug overdose			0
despite being made on a shoestring budget -- @entity17 is reported to have said the team behind it were forced to sell off furniture to buy film stock when the $ 1.55m budget began to run short -- " @entity184 " became @entity32 's biggest grossing film of 1995 , earning $ 20m worldwide , as well as a string of positive reviews			1
he followed it up with " trainspotting " ( 1996 ) the critically - acclaimed story of a group of @entity204 heroin addicts , which launched the careers of @entity206 , @entity207 ( " @entity210 " ) and @entity208 ( " @entity209 " ) , and was hailed by @entity212 magazine as " a visionary knockout spiked with insight , wild invention and outrageous wit			2
" @entity0 welcomes world for @entity10 opening ceremony its success -- the movie , which had cost just $ 2m to make , earned $ 72m -- prompted a move towards @entity222 , but @entity17 's career faltered with his first two big - budget projects , " @entity225 , " and " @entity226 , " and he briefly returned to television in the @entity32 , before making his movie comeback with 2002 's post-apocalyptic zombie flick " @entity230			1
" he then changed tone , directing the more family - orientated family feature " millions , " ( 2004 ) about two brothers who find a stash of pound notes only days before the @entity32 is set to switch its currency to the euro			0
five years later , he scooped the @entity239 when " @entity22 , " the story of a poor @entity244 teenager who wins a tv gameshow , swept the board at the @entity241			2
and it is the uplifting , life - affirming mood of " @entity22 " that the director brought to the opening ceremony , because despite the dark subject matter of many of his films , and his recent return to theater with a rapturously - received production of @entity255 , @entity17 insists he remains positive , an optimist			1
speaking in 2010 , he said : " i want it to feel like a very genuine expression of the welcome to the athletes and to the @entity29 of the city , and especially from east @entity0			0
" as the athletes launch into competition in venues around his home , his ceremony 's combination of novelty , national pride and nuttiness seems to have accomplished exactly that			0
