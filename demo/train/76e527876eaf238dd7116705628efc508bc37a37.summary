check for " @entity29 " not all webpages are equally secure			2
before entering any personal or payment information , make sure to look up at your browser bar			1
the url should start with @entity29 , not @entity35			0
that one letter on the end , @entity38 , is the difference between a secure site and an unsecured site			0
@entity42 takes on @entity43 in fight for holiday shoppers a secondary thing to look for is the small lock icon in your address bar			1

wait until you are back at home or work			0
vet the vendors and apps the @entity55 is packed with stores , some reputable and others downright shady			2
while bargain hunting , it can be tempting to make your purchase from the site offering the lowest price , but take a moment to research any vendors you 're not familiar with			0
" if something seems to good to be true , it probably is , " says @entity92 , a @entity19 shopping specialist			1
before you hand over your payment information , do a quick search for reviews of the vendor			1
calculate the total cost of an item , including shipping and tax , when determining the lowest price			0
the same tips apply when you 're using a mobile app. only download apps for your smartphones and tablets through official stores , like the @entity109 for @entity110 or @entity111 for @entity112			1
the occasional unsavory app has been known to slip through these proper channels			0
always check the reviews in the app stores to see what other users have to say			2
if there are bunch of one star reviews or warnings , do n't download the software			0
another option is to download a mobile security app to scan new software and links			2
beware of phishing , @entity129 and other scams by now most people know to keep an eye out for phishing scams -- e-mails disguised as legitimate companies or organizations that ask for payment or password information			2
but every now and then , one comes along that looks incredibly convincing			0
to be safe , copy and paste all links into a fresh browser window instead of clicking on the hyperlink , check the originating email address and when in doubt , contact the company to verify the e-mail			2
@entity129 ( a lovely portmanteau of " sms " and " phishing " ) has taken off recently , catching people off - guard who do n't expect to receive this type of spam as a text message			0
earlier this year , scammers sent texts telling people they had won a $ 1,000 gift card from @entity158			0
the texts linked to a page that asked for credit card information to cover the cost of shipping the prize			2
as a general rule , legitimate companies will never ask for your private information over email or text message , including payment information , usernames , passwords , mother 's maiden name or social security number			1
password protect mobile devices this was the number one mobile tip from the experts we talked to : turn on the passcode on your phone or tablet			1
it 's an easy and important precaution , but only 54 % of @entity73 do it			0
yes , it will take a few more seconds to access your email or open an app , but smartphones often contain more valuable information than what 's in your wallet			0
" many shopping apps archive your credit card information after your make a first purchase , and many apps do n't require that you enter your password every time you use it , " explained @entity68			1
if your phone or tablet is lost or stolen , anyone can access the wealth of data you have stored on your device			0
even if individual apps require passwords , someone can use your email and phone number to try and reset them			0
update often many operating system and application updates address security issues , plugging holes and fixing errors that could be exploited by hackers			0
on your computer , update the operating system when prompted , and make sure you 're running the latest version of your browser			0
for mobile devices , the routine is easier because the apps come through a central app store			1
you can see exactly what mobile apps need updating at a glance			2
use a credit card instead of a debit card credit cards are a more secure online payment option than your debit card			2
the majority of credit cards offer purchase protection in case your card number is stolen , or if you make a payment at an online store that delivers a bad product , or no product at all			1
we know you 're very busy this time of year , but also take an extra moment to comb over your statements			0
should any of these security precautions fail , you 'll want to catch suspicious charges as soon as possible .			0

check your address bar for " https " before entering payment information
when shopping from mobile devices , use trusted apps and @entity64 networks
always turn on the passcode protection for your mobile devices
