-- @entity1 was studying to become a doctor in the @entity3 a few years ago when her younger sister fell seriously ill while traveling in @entity5			1
the 12 - year - old girl , who 'd gone to the @entity8 country on holiday with relatives , needed urgent care but the nearest hospital could n't deal with her condition			1
@entity1 and her family immediately began looking for an air ambulance service to rapidly transport the girl , a sickle cell anemia sufferer , to a more suitable healthcare facility			1
they searched all across @entity8 but were stunned to find out there was none in the whole region			1
" the nearest one at the time was in @entity24 , " remembers @entity1			2
" they had a 12 - hour activation time so by the time they were ready to activate , my sister was dead			0
" it was really a devastating time for me and i started thinking about whether i should be in @entity30 talking about healthcare in @entity8 , or i should be in @entity8 dealing with healthcare and trying to do something about it			2
" @entity1 did the latter			2
motivated by the tragic death of her sister , the young doctor decided to leave behind a high - flying job in the @entity3 to take to the @entity5 skies and address the vital issue of urgent healthcare in @entity8 's most populous country			1
read this : private jets spread their wings in @entity8 a pioneering entrepreneur with an eye for opportunity , @entity1 set up flying doctors @entity5 , the first air ambulance service in @entity8 , transporting victims of medical emergencies , including industrial workers from the country 's booming oil and gas sector			1
" there was a situation in @entity5 where there were only two or three very good hospitals and they were sometimes a two , three , four - day journey away from the places where incidents happened , " says @entity1			1
" we also have a huge oil and gas industry and at that time there was no coordinated system for moving people from the offshore environment to a hospital to receive treatment			0
" currently in its third year , the @entity73 - based company has so far airlifted about 500 patients , using a fleet of planes and helicopters to rapidly move injured workers and critically ill people from remote areas to hospitals			2
" from patients with road traffic trauma , to bomb blast injuries to gunshot wounds , we save lives by moving these patients and providing a high level of care en route , " says @entity1			2
" many of our roads are poorly maintained , so emergency transport by road during the day is difficult			0
at night , we have armed robbers on our major highways ; coupled with poor lighting and poor state of the roads themselves , emergency transport by road is deadly for both patients and staff			0
" flying helicopters , speaking @entity105 at 27 , there is n't much @entity1 has n't achieved			1
born in @entity108 , she grew up in a foster home in the charming seaside town of @entity111 in the south - east of @entity30			0
aged 21 , @entity1 had already graduated from the @entity112 as a qualified doctor			1
she was then awarded the @entity114 and moved to @entity105 to conduct research in the field of regenerative medicine			0
after moving back to @entity118 the young doctor looked set for a promising career in medicine in the @entity3			0
but her desire to improve healthcare services in @entity8 brought her back to her roots			2
@entity1 quit her job , sold her assets and went on to study evacuation models and air ambulance services in other developing countries before launching her ambitious venture , which enables her to combine her " deep love for medicine and @entity8 " with her growing passion for flying -- @entity1 is also a also a trainee helicopter pilot			1
" i wanted to find a way that i can facilitate people who were critically ill , " she says			0
" get them to see a doctor , and not just any doctor -- i wanted to facilitate getting the right patient to the right facility , within the right time frame for that particular illness , and that 's why i came to start the air ambulance			1
" last month , the @entity146 recognized @entity1 's achievements by naming her amongst its prestigious @entity149 class of 2013 , a group it describes as the best of today 's leaders under the age of 40			1
" it came as a surprise to me actually , " she says of the honor			0
" i 'm really flattered and really happy			0
" trauma epidemic @entity5 , @entity8 's second - biggest economy , is the continent 's top producer of oil , boasting huge petroleum and natural gas reserves			1
the industry 's potential , coupled with a growing financial services sector , is expected to help drive further demand for companies such as flying doctors @entity5 , which works on a retainership basis with the public sector , wealthy individuals and oil and gas companies			1
yet @entity1 says that there are still several challenges that need to be navigated to successfully run a company like hers in the @entity8 country			1
" the aviation business is very expensive in @entity5 , " she says			2
" keeping costs down is always a challenge , " she adds , noting that red tape and bureaucracy are also testing small businesses ' endurance			0
but despite the challenges , @entity1 remains determined to bring about change in @entity5 's healthcare system			1
" i want to achieve a proper use of the healthcare sector in @entity5 , " she says			2

she says that whilst much attention and funding is directed toward infectious diseases , @entity8 is also facing a big problem treating physical injuries and wounds			0
" eighty percent of the world trauma occurs in low - middle income countries just like @entity5 , " she says			0
" i feel there should be more focus on the trauma epidemic that @entity8 currently faces			0
" " in the @entity3 , i would see one gunshot wound every three or four years			0
in @entity5 , i see one gunshot wound every three - four days			0
add in the road - traffic trauma , falls from heights , industrial injuries , stab sounds , injuries from domestic violence and you see a huge problem that definitely needs addressing			0
