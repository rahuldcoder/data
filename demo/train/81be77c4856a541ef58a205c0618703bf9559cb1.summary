the discovery of a slain @entity3 teen in @entity4 early wednesday further inflamed tensions in a region already unsettled over the killings of three @entity8 teens , not to mention decades of entrenched enmity between all sides			1
@entity13 , 17 , was heading from his home to a mosque in the middle - class neighborhood of @entity17 for prayers around 4 a.m. when three men forced him into a car and drove off , his father , @entity11 , told @entity22			0
his body was found about an hour later at a forest in @entity4			0
the killing quickly triggered condemnations from @entity3 and @entity8 leaders , as well as from the @entity28			1
abducted @entity3 teen was kind , beloved those who spoke out passionately included an uncle of one of the three @entity8 teens whose bodies were found earlier this week			1
he called the young @entity3 's killing " a forbidden action , and it has no forgiveness			1
" " any act of revenge of any kind whatsoever is completely inappropriate and wrong			0
murder is murder , " said @entity40 , uncle of @entity41 , a 16 - year - old dual @entity8 - @entity28 citizen , to @entity8 's @entity42			1
" one should not differentiate between bloods , be it @entity46 or @entity47			0
@entity8 authorities are probing wednesday 's death , with police spokesman @entity50 tweeting this effort will try to determine if it is a " criminal or nationalistic " act -- the latter term referring to a politically motivated act in retaliation for the @entity8 teens ' killings			1
@entity58 , a spokesman for prime minister @entity59 , told @entity22 late wednesday that investigators " at this stage can not say who did this killing			1
" this came hours after @entity59 's office promised a speedy investigation to find " who is behind this despicable murder and the background to this act , " according to a statement from his office			1
" @entity59 calls on all sides not to take the law into their own hands			2
@entity8 is a country of law and everyone is ordered to act according to the law			2
" the killing riled many @entity3 , particularly in @entity4			1
but it did n't happen in isolation			0
israelis and @entity3 continue to trade blows -- over longstanding issues unrelated to @entity13 's death -- through rocket attacks and airstrikes			1
all this violence , from various angles , leads to one big question : when will it stop ? report : body was ' charred and bore signs of violence ' " @entity98 " kidnapped the teenager and his body " was charred and bore signs of violence , " according to the @entity3 state news agency @entity97			2
@entity103 , through saliva samples , was used to positively identify the boy , his father said			2
@entity50 told the @entity105 the teen had significant burn marks			0
the same @entity8 publication also reported police are looking into previous kidnap attempts on members of the teenager 's family related to a personal dispute			2
yet @entity11 , the boy 's father , blamed @entity8 and vehemently denied reports that this may have been tied to any sort of family dispute			1
" @entity59 is responsible for the crime , " the father told @entity22 , " because he is the one who is giving the settlers the cover and supporting them			1
" the teen 's cousin , @entity126 , said whoever carried out the abduction was driving a car that had been used in an attempted abduction two days ago			1
a similar claim was made to @entity133 by @entity135 member @entity134			0
the cousin passionately suggested : " the @entity8 police and @entity8 government should do the same as they have done in @entity140 : demolish and blow the settler houses who have done this crime			2
" the @entity8 military destroyed the homes of the two suspects in the killings of the three @entity8 teens			1
when confronted with this suggestion , @entity58 insisted " we are totally color blind when it comes to this sort of criminal act			0
" " there 's no difference between a @entity47 resident of @entity4 or an @entity46 resident of @entity4 , " the spokesman said			0
" ... police will get to the bottom of this			0
" " it is sickening to think of an innocent 17 - year - old boy snatched off the streets and his life stolen from him and his family , " said secretary of state of @entity164 , who talked with @entity59 by phone about the situation			2
" there are no words to convey adequately our condolences to the @entity3 people			2
" he noted that both @entity8 and @entity3 officials have condemned it , and he added to @entity59 's call			1
" those who undertake acts of vengeance only destabilize an already explosive and emotional situation			0
" @entity183 president @entity182 , who heads the @entity185 party and is based in the @entity186 , called @entity188 's father and promised that those behind his abduction and death will be brought to justice , @entity97 , the @entity3 state news agency , reported			1
and @entity193 -- the militant @entity194 organization that controls @entity195 -- said in a statement that it holds the " @entity8 occupation ( fully ) responsible , " adding that the incident " exposes ( @entity8 's ) ugly ... racism " and " refutes the @entity8 narration of being the victim all the time			1
" anger , clashes in @entity3 neighborhoods of @entity4 as news of the boy 's death spread , public anger in @entity3 neighborhoods of @entity4 rose to levels rarely , if ever , seen since the @entity210 , or uprising , last decade			1
that led to several clashes around the city , the biggest of which was centered in @entity17			0
residents there threw stones at security forces and the @entity8 authorities responded with occasional volleys of stun grenades or tear gas			2
some protesters attacked two palestinians whom they mistook for undercover @entity8 police , the @entity105 reported			2
the clashes expanded and continued through midnight in the @entity3 neighborhood , with a large amount of @entity8 forces on hand			1
in @entity234 , @entity3 threw rocks at a nearby settlement and several of them were injured by rubber bullets , witnesses said			0
and some tossed @entity240 cocktails at an @entity8 settlement in @entity242 , outside @entity4 's @entity243			2
the @entity3 @entity244 reported that more than 100 were injured , most of them in @entity17 , in the clashes			0
there were concerns that the @entity3 teenager 's funeral could spark further unrest			2
but his father said thursday he was still waiting to hear from @entity8 authorities when the body would be handed over to the family			1
" the autopsy should be done around 1 p.m. , and then i am supposed to wait for a call , " @entity11 said on @entity3 television			0
" we will not bury my son at night , " he said			0
" we will do it during the day			0
if they purposely delay , we will do it during the day even ( if that means ) tomorrow			0
" @entity8 airstrikes into @entity195 meanwhile , the dangerous back - and - forth between @entity195 and @entity8 was erupting yet again			1
@entity267 from the @entity3 territory into @entity8 was met by at least eight airstrikes within about an hour early thursday			1
three hit a @entity193 intelligence building in @entity271 , while at least one struck the @entity274 training camp in @entity275			0
@entity3 medical sources reported at least 10 injured , one of them seriously			0
@entity277 said the airstrikes -- going after 15 @entity193 targets -- were in response to the firing of more than 20 rockets into @entity8 since wednesday			1
this is in addition to other actions -- including the arrests of hundreds of @entity193 activists , the demolition of homes and the closure of dozens of institutions in @entity195 , according to @entity59 -- targeting @entity193 and focused in @entity195			1
this action follows the abduction of @entity8 teens @entity295 , @entity296 and @entity41 as they were on their way home from school june 13 ; the three were found dead on monday in a @entity186 field			0
@entity193 praised the kidnappings but denied that it was responsible for what happened			2
it warned that if @entity59 " brings a war on @entity195 , the gates of hell will open to him			1
" at the teens ' funerals , @entity59 said the country would avenge their deaths at " the hands of evil men			0
" " a broad moral gulf separates us from our enemies , " he said			0
" they sanctify death ; we sanctify life			0
they sanctify cruelty and we mercy and compassion			0
that is the secret of our strength			0
" opinion : teens ' killing hurts @entity8 , bad for @entity3 opinion : slain teens call for justice , not escalation			1
