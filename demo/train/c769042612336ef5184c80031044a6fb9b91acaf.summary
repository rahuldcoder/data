@entity1 's prime minister thursday ordered his government to find " multiple , speedy and sure " ways to stop the spread of radioactive groundwater around the meltdown - stricken @entity7 nuclear power plant , including freezing the surrounding ground			1
prime minister @entity11 's directive comes two weeks after the @entity12 admitted that contaminated water was leaching into the @entity14 from the plant , the site of the worst nuclear accident in a quarter - century			1
" this is not an issue where we can let @entity12 take complete responsibility , " @entity11 said at a meeting at the government 's nuclear disaster response headquarters			1
" we have to deal with this at a national level			1
" @entity11 said he has told @entity1 's @entity27 to " provide multiple , speedy and sure solutions to this issue			1
" @entity12 has proposed setting up a subterranean barrier around the plant by freezing the ground around it , preventing groundwater from leaking into the damaged plant and carrying radioactive particles with it as it seeps out			1
" the public has a strong concern over the contaminated water problem , and this is an urgent issue to solve , " @entity11 said			2
" we will not leave it only to @entity12 , but will lay out firm measures			2
" that will mean a still - undetermined amount of direct government spending to aid the ailing utility , @entity47 , @entity1 's chief cabinet secretary , told reporters			0
building a frozen wall around the plant is " unprecedented , " he said			2
" to build such a wall , the government should take the lead to promote this kind of project , " @entity47 said			0
" we have to provide the support to do so			0
" the plan to freeze the ground presents significant technical challenges			2
it could involve plunging thousands of tubes carrying a powerful coolant liquid deep into the ground surrounding the stricken reactor buildings			0
the technology has been used before in the construction of tunnels , but never on the massive scale that the @entity7 plant would require			1
@entity12 , the country 's largest utility , has been grappling with water issues ever since the @entity7 plant was hit by the march 2011 earthquake and tsunami that devastated eastern @entity1			1
scientists who monitor radiation levels offshore have pointed to persistent high readings as evidence of an ongoing leak for more than a year , but the utility did not publicly admit the problem until late july			0
vast stands of storage tanks have grown up around the plant as @entity12 tries to manage the hundreds of tons of water involved every day , and the company has built an underground barrier to prevent contaminated groundwater from reaching the sea			1
but it remains a difficult problem , @entity94 , @entity12 's acting nuclear power chief , said earlier this week			2
" it 's a present reality that the contaminated water is seeping out to the bay without us being able to control it , " @entity94 said			0
man who battled @entity1 's nuclear meltdown dies @entity12 is also pumping hundreds of tons of water a day into the plant to cool the crippled reactors two and a half years later , though most of that fluid is recycled			1
the 2011 tsunami swamped the plant , located 240 km ( 150 miles ) north of @entity109 , and knocked out power to cooling systems for the three reactors that were operating at the time			0
the result was the second - worst nuclear accident in history , trailing only the 1986 disaster at @entity118 , in the @entity119			1
meltdowns and hydrogen explosions spewed radioactive particles across many of the surrounding towns , complicating an already historic disaster			0
though no deaths have been directly attributed to the accident , tens of thousands of people from towns as far as 25 miles away have been displaced by the disaster			0
google maps show @entity7 nuclear ghost town in july , @entity12 disclosed that water from test wells around the reactor buildings showed concentrations of radioactive tritium in one well as high as 500,000 bequerels -- a unit of radioactive intensity -- per liter of water			1
by comparison , @entity1 's maximum safe level of radioactivity in drinking water for adults is 300 bequerels per liter			0
another reactor byproduct , strontium - 90 , has been showing up in increasing concentrations as well , said @entity150 , a marine radiochemist at the @entity152 in the @entity153			0
@entity154 mimics calcium in the body , seeking out bone in animal life			0
@entity7 tuna study finds miniscule health risks @entity150 said the amount of radioactive material leaking from the plant now is a small fraction -- about one ten - thousandth -- of what poured out of the plant in the weeks following the meltdowns			2
but while @entity12 's admission was not news to scientists , " what 's less clear to me is how much this has changed in the last month , " he said			2
" and i think that 's part of the urgency			0
" @entity175 , a former nuclear plant operator and engineer , told @entity178 on tuesday that the current problem may leave @entity12 and the @entity1 government with two choices sure to stoke further public anger : " you can either dump it in the ocean , or you can evaporate it			1
" " at the end of the day , collecting 400 tons of water every single day is not a sustainable solution , " he said			0
federal officials allowed the @entity190 nuclear plant in @entity191 , the site of the worst @entity153 nuclear accident , to let contaminated water evaporate , @entity175 said -- but @entity190 was nowhere near the scale of the @entity7 disaster			1
" we 're in uncharted territory here , " he said			0
@entity1 signs deal with @entity199 to build nuclear plant			2

prime minister orders " multiple , speedy and sure " plans to stop @entity7 leaks
" we have to deal with this at a national level , " @entity11 says
plant operator @entity12 has proposed freezing the ground around the site
the plant was the site of the worst nuclear accident since 1986
