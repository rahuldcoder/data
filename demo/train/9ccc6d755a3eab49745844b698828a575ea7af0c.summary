-- it was wednesday morning when i noticed a popular post on reddit that shared an unbelievable photo of a $ 1,300 hdmi cable			1
naturally , i ordered three on my corporate @entity8 and expensed them as " miscellaneous			2
" ( also recently expensed as miscellaneous : @entity10 sunday ticket , @entity11 and a pony keg of @entity13			2
i think @entity14 is on the ninth floor			2
i 'll just head up there now			2
) at first , i thought it had to be a simple labeling mistake at whatever store the picture was taken			2
a company called @entity22 sells @entity24 cables that cost more than my actual tv			1
and i fully support it			1
i mean , somebody must be buying them			1
granted , i 'm not sure how @entity30 cables satisfy a rich man 's narcissism , but surely these work better than , say , driving around in my @entity34			1
or as all the sexy ladies in @entity36 call it ... my @entity34			2
i first entered the dirty world of @entity24 cables a couple years ago when i finally purchased a new tv			1
although , to be slightly more accurate , i finally purchased @entity41 streaming , and then i had to buy a new tv			0
first month of @entity41 streaming : $ 1,200			1
you see , since 2006 , i had been enjoying an old , 65 - inch @entity43 that a friend gave me			0
it was old in that he was more than happy to give it away			0
and it was large in that it was an actual hippopotamus that somehow aired @entity51 reruns			0
fast forward to november 2010 when , suddenly , my life was n't complete without @entity41 streaming			0
but there was one little problem : my hippopotamus did n't have the correct hardware in the back to properly connect my laptop			0
clearly this meant it was time for a new tv			0
i can be rather impulsive			0
( i wonder how my @entity62 stock is doing			0
) next thing i know there 's a 55 - inch @entity65 in my shopping cart and a kid with pimples trying to tell me why i absolutely , positively needed $ 40 monster - brand @entity24 cables			1
i admit , his case was compelling			0
apparently , if i did n't get the good cables , my new tv would grow up to be a serial killer			1
so i bought the stupid cables and boasted about my big purchase to a colleague at work the next day			1
" dude , this tv is great -- @entity41 is actually built in ! and i got these amazing @entity24 cables that really bring out the high - def. they only cost like 40 bucks each			1
" to which he replied , " should n't you be wearing pants ? " he later advised me to buy cheap , $ 3 cables online , and so far the hd still seems to be coming in perfectly			1
i can pick out individual hairs in @entity90 's beard			0
which brings us back to @entity94 cables			1
the company 's website says : " @entity30 incorporates @entity22 's highest - performance , lowest - distortion @entity99 conductors			1
silver is known for its high conductivity and its ' colorless ' sonic presentation			0
" i have no idea what this means , but it seems to suggest that , if i were to buy the @entity94 cable , @entity90 's beard actually would jump out of the tv and make me an omelet			0
i do n't generally get things			0
and reading through any @entity24 discussion online will only further the confusion			1
some people say quality cables matter			2
some people say they do n't			0
in the end , it 's all ones and zeroes to me			0
if you look for an expert opinion from @entity123 , however , you 'll find they say " we 've long been advocates of not paying for pricey cables , which often do little more than pad the pockets of the manufacturers that make them and the retailers that sell them			2
" the only reasons to buy anything but low - end cables , they say , is if you plan to unplug and replug the cables all the time or if the cable is longer than 30 feet			2
otherwise , " any high - speed cable should suffice , " the group says , " and do n't let a package or retail associate tell you otherwise			0
" still , you 've got to hand it to them			0
@entity22 cares about performance , and they seem to specialize in super-high - end everything			1
i actually found a $ 6,900 @entity148 power cable on @entity149			2
@entity22 calls it the @entity151			1
i call it " miscellaneous			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity155 .			1

@entity22 sells @entity24 cables for $ 1,300
@entity155 : " i fully support it . i mean , somebody must be buying them "
some cables are available for as little as $ 3 online
