-- in @entity2 , they use the expression " futbol arte " to describe the type of soccer which made the country 's world champion team of 1970 so easy on the eye			1
but no longer -- football has changed , and @entity2 has changed too			1
when it won the @entity14 in 1994 , the national team 's style of play was dubbed " futebol dá força " -- a tougher , more pragmatic approach			0
and , after a year of violent protests , rubber bullets and tear gas , the romantic ideal of @entity2 often portrayed in glossy travel magazines seems hard to imagine			1
thursday marks the start of an opportunity for @entity2 to redefine itself after a difficult 12 months preparing for arguably the world 's largest and most popular event			1
so no pressure , then , on @entity2 's footballers , who take on @entity27 in the tournament 's opening game in @entity30 , the recent epicenter of the unrest			1
will the host team 's expected progress , led by current hero @entity35 , help ease the sense of injustice which has ingrained itself within the population ? as if that was n't a great enough weight on the shoulders of coach @entity44 's team , there is the added pressure of @entity2 's quest to exorcise the ghosts of 1950 -- which will begin 64 years after what is known as the country 's " @entity49			1
" when @entity52 defeated @entity2 in the deciding match courtesy of @entity55 's strike , it left an indelible mark on a country whose first love has always been football			1
and yet , after more than six decades of waiting for the tournament to return to their home country , the @entity2 people are otherwise engaged			1
whereas football may still be a religion , its @entity2 congregation have slowly turned their backs on their deity			1
" @entity71 is not for the @entity2 , " 59 - year - old street vendor @entity70 told @entity0			1
" it is for the foreigners and @entity75 friends			0
" while thousands of tourists flock to @entity2 and media pack the streets to broadcast the action across the world , @entity30 has been brought to a standstill by metro workers striking over wages -- the latest in a series of protests against the government			1
an estimated $ 11 billion of public money has been spent on hosting the tournament -- much to the chagrin of the protesters , who argue that money might have been better spent on public services			2
. " i think the best moment to protest is at the @entity97 , " says two - time @entity14 winner @entity93 , @entity2 's most - capped footballer , who was speaking to @entity0 to promote the @entity95 skills challenge			1
" this will be the moment we can show ourselves that we can fight for our rights -- better education , better healthcare , better culture , better transportation , " he told @entity0			0
" this is the moment we can show the world we are capable of staging a well - organized @entity14			2
we will show we are a democratic country and ( later ) fight for our rights			0
" once the football starts , nobody will be more relieved than @entity75 and its under - fire president , @entity110			2
the 78 - year - old , who has held the position since 1998 , was told tuesday that he should not stand for a fifth four - year term by some of the organization 's key @entity116 members within @entity118			2
however , at wednesday 's @entity119 in @entity30 , he told delegates " my mission is not finished ... i am ready to accompany you in the future			2
" just a fortnight after allegations of corruption during the @entity128 vote was reported by @entity130 's @entity129 , @entity110 has been forced to endure one of the most difficult periods of his tenure			0
the newspaper claims to have unearthed millions of emails and other documentation which allege @entity139 's former @entity138 member @entity137 used a multimillion - dollar slush fund to buy support for the bid			0
the claims have been strenuously denied by @entity139 organizers , who in a statement released to @entity146 said they had been co-operating fully with @entity148 lawyer @entity147 , who has been appointed by @entity75 to lead an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity151 , awarded to @entity152 and @entity139			0
but president of the @entity155 @entity154 believes enough is enough			0
" i then said at the microphone : ' i like you a lot , there is nothing personal here , but the reputation of @entity75 is today inextricably linked to corruption , " recounted @entity154 of what transpired at tuesday 's @entity118 meeting			0
" @entity75 has a president			0
you are responsible , you should not stand again			0
" despite the barbs , @entity110 appeared in bullish mood wednesday when speaking at the world governing body 's congress , insisting @entity75 could be a force for positive change			2
while @entity116 nations have gone public about their opposition to @entity110 , @entity175 and @entity177 members have backed the @entity178 to continue in the role he has held since 1998			2
" the answer is easy and simple ... we must lead by example and we must listen to all voices , we must be responsible and upright in all that we do , we must do the right thing even if that comes at a cost , " @entity110 told the audience			0
" it 's not always very easy to live up to this principle			0
but it 's our duty ... if we do not do it , who will ? " the bad news for @entity110 is that the @entity129 promises more revelations on @entity139 , which suggests football might continue to play second fiddle to politics for a while yet			0
a successful @entity14 and a @entity2 victory might go some way to temporarily muffling the protests of both the @entity2 people and @entity75 's growing critics			2
in @entity204 , the @entity203 statue overlooks the @entity206 stadium , where the @entity14 final will be staged on july 13			1
in just over a month we will find out if @entity2 2014 has restored people 's faith in football -- not just in the host nation , but across the globe			1
