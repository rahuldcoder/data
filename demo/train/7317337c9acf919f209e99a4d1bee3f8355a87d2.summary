@entity0 , @entity1 -- after a lukewarm reception from television buyers , 3 - d technology is pushing its way onto small screens			1
as @entity10 plans to launch with the first major gadget that can show three - dimension visuals without the need for special glasses in the @entity15 on sunday , two large @entity9 electronics manufacturers are following suit			1
@entity17 has unveiled the @entity18 , a follow - up to @entity20 's breakout smartphone			2
it has a 4.3 - inch touchscreen , which can display eye - popping 3 - d without needing glasses			1
users will also be able to capture photos and videos in @entity23 using a pair of cameras on the back			0
like the original evo , the 3d version will run @entity35 's @entity34 operating system and connect to @entity20 's fast @entity37 data network			0
@entity38 has been working for a year and half on a @entity23 smartphone of its own , said @entity41 , the @entity43 company 's vice president of strategy			1
the @entity44 , as it 's been called , will launch on @entity46 's network with the name @entity47			0
@entity46 says it will be available in the " coming months , " and a price has n't been set			0
@entity38 developers spent a great deal of time fine - tuning the pair of 5 - megapixel cameras to accurately capture @entity23 media , @entity41 said			1
calibrating the cameras to produce good - looking stills and video is more difficult than pulling off a glasses - free display , he said			2
the @entity18 prototype we tested at the @entity60 conference this week shot blurry video			0
@entity17 is still working on that aspect , which will probably take several more months to perfect , said @entity63 , a @entity20 marketing director			2
the @entity18 will be available this summer , he said			0
@entity10 's @entity64 also has a pair of cameras for capturing scenes in @entity23 , and it works quite well			1
being the first out of the gate to offer a mainstream glasses - free @entity23 gadget , @entity10 expected to find competitors , and it soon did when @entity38 announced its phone			1
" i was n't frustrated or irritated by it , " @entity74 , a @entity10 producer who played a key role on developing the @entity64 , said through a translator in a recent interview			0
" i mean , considering the technology was out there in the world , i was n't even really surprised by it			0
" the @entity84 game company plans to fend off competitors by partnering with media publishers that can offer more games and movies in @entity23 " you need not only the capabilities ; you need the content , " @entity89 , @entity10 's president and operating chief , said in an interview			1
" they 're not going to have the great gaming content that we have			0
" for their phones , @entity38 and @entity17 are lobbying game developers to create @entity23 software for @entity35 's @entity34 smartphone platform			1
owners also will be able to download the thousands of games already available for @entity34			0
@entity38 expects to include a few games packaged with the @entity47 and have at least 10 games available when the device is made available to purchase , @entity41 said			0
with a team led by @entity41 , @entity38 also persuaded @entity35 to make @entity110 videos produced with 3 - d cameras available in a separate app and allow the phone 's users to upload their own , @entity41 said			1
" instead of being at the mercy of @entity118 studios to bring @entity23 content , why do n't we enable our customers to create their own @entity23 content ? " @entity41 said			1
@entity35 's @entity110 team also helped @entity38 tweak the quality of the videos produced by the phone , he said			0
the @entity18 will have about a half - dozen @entity23 games at launch in addition to the full " @entity131 " film , @entity126 said			2
the phone will also have the @entity133 application			0
@entity17 touts on its website : " you look better without the 3d glasses , " as a hand tosses a pair into a trash can			2
@entity38 's initiative , too , was designed to eliminate the need for wonky glasses , @entity41 said			2
" all our tv guys and our mobile - phone guys , we try to solve that problem -- to force people to wear glasses , " @entity41 said			0
" @entity151 stuff should not be a sit - up experience			0
" both @entity38 and @entity17 are planning to debut tablet computers that can , like their phones , capture @entity23 with a pair of cameras			1
however , the tablets require users wear dorky , two - toned glasses in order to view the @entity23 content			1
@entity17 's tablet , with its 7 - inch touchscreen that requires glasses for 3 - d viewing , is called the @entity37 and will be available on @entity20			1
@entity41 from @entity38 , which is bringing a tablet to @entity168 's network , said implementing glasses - free @entity23 on the @entity171 's 9 - inch screen was " a cost issue			1
" however , by enabling the device to capture @entity23 pictures and video , @entity41 hopes the excitement carries over into @entity38 's tv business , which has struggled to sell @entity23 sets			2
@entity168 , the @entity171 's exclusive carrier , believes that it 's still " early days " for 3 - d technology and that issues will be solved over time with new devices , said @entity183 , a senior product manager for the company			2
@entity185 has n't ventured into the mobile 3 - d territory yet			2
" there has been a big push for ( @entity23 ) on the tv side , but we have n't done anything on the phone side , " said spokesman @entity187			0
@entity194 , the strategy chief for @entity195 , said mobile devices will be more valuable in the 3 - d space as a way to capture content in that format , rather than to view it			1
" i think it 's still pretty early , " he said .			0

@entity17 and @entity38 are *prepping* smartphones that can display 3 - d without needing glasses
the two companies are also working on 3 - d tablets , but those will require glasses
@entity10 *executives* say @entity17 and @entity38 will struggle to find @entity23 content
