@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity6 's father filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against dr. @entity9 on friday , the anniversary of the pop star 's death , @entity4 's lawyer said			1
the suit alleges that @entity9 gave paramedics and doctors false information about the " polypharmacy " of drugs @entity6 had been given and hindered efforts to revive him in an ambulance and at @entity21 , according to a copy obtained by @entity2			1
the suit said that " other parties responsible for @entity6 's death " would be added but that the plaintiff " has not yet gathered sufficient information regarding their potential liability or responsibility			1
" a complaint filed by @entity4 with the @entity1 medical board this month also named @entity33 , the company that was producing his son 's comeback concerts			0
@entity9 was hired to serve as @entity6 's personal doctor two months before the @entity39 debut of the concerts were set			2
the @entity42 coroner ruled that @entity6 's death was caused by an overdose of propofol , a powerful anesthesia that @entity9 has acknowledged the pop star used to help him sleep			1
@entity4 attorney @entity47 obtained a court order this year giving him medical records from @entity21 , where @entity6 died on june 25 , 2009			2
the suit also alleges that @entity9 delayed calling for paramedics for over an hour , after he found @entity6 not breathing minutes after he injected him with propofol to help him fall asleep			1
the suit contends that @entity9 used the time to hide evidence of drugs he had been giving @entity6			1
when the ambulance carrying @entity6 from his home arrived at the emergency room at 1:13 p.m. , he was identified as " @entity61 , " the suit said			1
he had " no pulse , blood pressure , spontaneous respiration or heartbeat , " it said			0
@entity9 , who had taken over control of resuscitation efforts from paramedics , said nothing to emergency room doctors about the propofol or " other drugs " he had given @entity6 earlier in the day , it said			1
it quoted a report written the next day by one of those doctors , who wrote that @entity9 told them " the patient had been working long hours but had not been ill. " " the only reported medications reported for the patient were valium and @entity83 , " dr. @entity80 wrote			0
" there is no history of drug use by the patient as reported by dr. @entity9			1
" a police report said @entity9 told investigators two days later that " he was afraid @entity6 was addicted to propofol			2
" " he had a history of addiction , and the defendant was trying to wean him off the drugs , yet he told dr. @entity97 two days earlier that @entity6 had no drug use history , " the suit said			2
the toxicology results included in the autopsy report said the propofol level found in @entity6 's body was equal to what would be used to sedate a patient for major surgery			0
@entity9 , who has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in @entity6 's death , did not give him that much of the anesthesia , his defense lawyer said recently			2
" there is no way that dr. @entity9 pumped @entity6 full of propofol sufficient for major surgery , " attorney @entity110 said			1
i would stake anything that i own on this fact			0
" the lawsuit contends that @entity6 showed " neurological , pulmonary , and amnesia signs " in his final weeks as he rehearsed in @entity0 for the @entity39 shows			0
it said @entity6 borrowed jackets from others and used a heater at rehearsals " to control the shivering			0
" " in may and june , 2009 , @entity6 was confused , easily frightened , unable to remember , obsessive , and disoriented , " the suit said			0
" he has impaired memory , a loss of appetite , and absence of energy			0
he was cold and shivering during the summer rehearsals for his show , and as shown in photographs and motion pictures of him , he uncharacteristically wore heavy clothing during the rehearsals , while other dancers wore scant clothing and were perspiring from the heat			0
