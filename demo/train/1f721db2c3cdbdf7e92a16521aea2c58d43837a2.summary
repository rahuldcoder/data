@entity0 -- @entity2 apologized to a customer thursday after one of its agents left a message on a customer 's voicemail warning him that he would receive a cease - and - desist letter after the customer e-mailed @entity2 's ceo directly about some complaints			1
@entity14 , an @entity2 customer and @entity16 owner since 2008 from @entity17 , @entity0 , told @entity1 that he was dissatisfied with the company 's handling of questions surrounding his @entity16 upgrade eligibility dates			1
he was also displeased with the recent news of @entity2 's pricing plan restructuring , which , among other things , will end unlimited data plans			0
he decided to e-mail ceo @entity27 directly about his issues " please do n't have one of your $ 12/hour ' executive relations ' college students call me -- i 've found them to be generally poorly informed ( @entity37 readers know more than they do about @entity2 ) and they have little authority to do anything sensible , " reads a portion of @entity14 's e-mail to @entity27			1
