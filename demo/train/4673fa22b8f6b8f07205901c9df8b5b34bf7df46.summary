@entity0 -- calling the latest battle over the rev. @entity9 's possessions a " spiritually violent " moment in her family 's history , the civil rights icon 's sole surviving daughter said thursday she already had won the " moral high ground , " regardless of a court 's decision			1
at issue are her father 's 1964 @entity14 and traveling @entity16 , used to swear in president @entity17 for his second term			1
@entity19 declined to hand the items over on wednesday , as mandated in a february court order			1
she has previously said her brothers would sell the items if she gave them up			2
the @entity25 in @entity26 extended the deadline for @entity9 to produce the items until monday , saying it would hold them in a safe - deposit box until the litigation between @entity9 and her brothers is settled			1
" i must say it is deep - in - my - soul difficult to place my father 's prized , precious heirlooms under the custody of the state , even if only for a season , " she told supporters who gathered at @entity0 's historic @entity42			1
" yet i recognize that justice and righteousness are not always aligned , " she continued , " and there 's often a disconnect between @entity49 's law and man 's law			0
as dad said , ' we must accept finite disappointment but never lose infinite hope			0
' " @entity9 said she " was led by the @entity56 to comply " with the new monday deadline			1
@entity9 further told the assembled crowd , made up of supporters and civil rights activists , that the public tug - of - war was a " defining moment for our family " and " an embarrassing chapter in our family 's history			2
" she pleaded with her brothers , who were not in attendance , and any prospective buyers to " step up to reason and do what your consciousness says is right			0
" according to an affidavit filed in the lawsuit , @entity9 wrote an e-mail to her brother @entity78 in 2007 , saying she was ok with selling some of her father 's possessions			2
she now says the @entity16 and @entity82 are too sacred to part with			0
emphasizing her deep love for her brothers , @entity19 said she 'd ask them to reconsider their stance on the heirlooms and noted that only one brother would need to agree to keep the items in the family			1
however , @entity19 told @entity1 she did not foresee her and her brothers reaching any middle ground			2
she has not spoken to them in some time , she said			0
@entity1 's attempts to reach the attorney for the @entity97 were not immediately successful			0
the three @entity9 siblings make up the surviving board of the estate			1
they took a vote before the lawsuit over whether to sell the items , which @entity19 lost 1 - 2			1
the @entity9 brothers say that the future of the estate would be threatened if a sale could not be made			2
no prospective buyers or dollar amount have been publicly disclosed			0
@entity19 says she wants to keep the items for reasons other than money			0
" if it was about money , hey , i should have just been quiet and took my cut from the sale of these items , but i try to live my life on principle			0
" the case is scheduled to be heard september 29 .			0

@entity19 says it 's " deep - in - my - soul difficult " to hand over precious heirlooms
@entity25 ordered that she hand over @entity9 's @entity16 and @entity14 last month
she missed wednesday 's deadline but says she will meet new monday deadline
@entity9 siblings have been *feuding* , and @entity19 says brothers plan to sell items
