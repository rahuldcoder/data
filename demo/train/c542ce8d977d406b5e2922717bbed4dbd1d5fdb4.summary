-- if it seems to you that there 's a food safety crisis every other week , you 're actually not paying close enough attention			1
since the start of summer 2014 alone , the @entity6 has announced 37 different recalls , market alerts and safety withdrawals related to food , and the @entity12 has issued 14			1
some recalls result from mislabeling ( such as undeclared ingredients like shellfish , milk , nuts , eggs or wheat gluten ) or improper processing , while other recalled foods were contaminated with listeria , @entity22 , salmonella or botulism			1
about 48 million people -- 1 in 6 @entity25 -- contract some form of food poisoning each year , according to the @entity28			1
that 's 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths that are , by the federal government 's estimations , " largely preventable			1
" at any given time the @entity6 is responsible for watching over some 167,000 domestic food facilities or farms and another 421,000 facilities or farms outside the @entity25 , according to @entity6 officials			1
but there are only about 1,100 inspectors to oversee these facilities , officials told @entity0 in 2012			0
tainted food and mislabeled food slip through the cracks all the time , and unwitting consumption can result in conditions ranging from stomach discomfort and fever to death from infection and allergic reactions			2
it 's in a food producer 's best interest to get a bad product off store shelves and alert consumers as swiftly as possible -- and it 's the duty of the federal government to help minimize the risk to public safety			1
often , their best course of collective action is a recall , but what does that actually mean ? who is looking out for your food safety ? prior to the passage of the @entity72 , the @entity6 could strongly suggest action , but had no authority to issue a mandatory recall of potentially harmful food			1
( for example , in the summer of 2010 , consumers had to rely on suppliers ' voluntary removal of nearly 500 million eggs from the marketplace in order to make sure that store supplies were free of salmonella			0
still , an estimated 1,600 people nationwide were sickened by the eggs			0
) since president @entity89 signed the law into effect in january 2011 , there has only been one attempt by the @entity6 to enforce the mandatory recall of a food item : pet treats that were found to have been tainted with salmonella and allegedly caused several dogs to become ill. ( in the end , the company was given a two - day notice to take corrective action -- which it did -- and enforcement was n't needed			2
) but in the interim , hundreds of food items -- including 9 million pounds of adulterated meat , massive quantities of stone fruit and several dozen varieties of peanut butter -- have been voluntarily recalled by their producers			2
there are a few ways that can be set in motion			0
a producer may , through its own internal product testing or customer reports , find that there is an issue with its food and alert the @entity6 or @entity12			2
in other cases , testing by these agencies ' inspectors may reveal an issue , which is communicated to the company			2
and in others , local and state health services will contact the @entity28 , which can identify patterns of foodborne illness using the @entity132 system and in turn alert the @entity6 and @entity12			0
foodborne illness 101 if the product is meat , poultry or egg - based , @entity12 can form a committee to determine if a recall is needed			0
if so , agents collaborate with producers to make sure that the product is no longer available to the public , and that consumers have received adequate warning via the media and the @entity12 website about what products are affected and what course of action to take			1
if a risk is posed , but a recall is not needed , @entity12 will issue a public health alert			2
the @entity6 oversees all food that 's not under fsis jurisdiction and will evaluate each case to determine the threat it poses to public safety			1
in most cases , the agency will work with the producer to take corrective action at the facility level ( cleaning machines and workrooms , safely removing contaminated ingredients and the like ) and alert the public if needed			0
all cases are listed on the @entity6 website , but more severe ones will be communicated to the media via press release			0
but if the risk to public safety is found to be particularly high , the @entity72 allows the agency to shut down manufacturing until the threat has been contained			1
this power was enacted for the first time in november 2012 , when a multistate outbreak of @entity181 was linked to peanut butter produced by @entity183 the @entity6 suspended the company 's food facility registration , effectively prohibiting it from distributing food			0
@entity187 subsequently declared bankruptcy and shut down production for good			0
both @entity6 and @entity12 use a three - tier classification for the threat posed by the food : " class i recall : a situation in which there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death			0
" @entity204 recall : a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote			0
" @entity204 recall : a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences			0
" so how does a reasonable consumer stay apprised of all these goings - on and avoid spending precious time making the rounds of governmental websites on a daily basis ? follow @ @entity223 on @entity224			0
the account posts the most recent additions to the recall list , and its sister account , @ @entity229 shares a mix of @entity12 recall news and food safety tips			1
if @entity234 is more your speed , the @entity6 and @entity12 both offer newsfeeds , as well as e-mail blasts to keep you on top of your food safety game .			1

1 in 6 @entity25 will get food poisoning this year
according to the federal government , these illnesses are largely preventable
recalls by federal agencies can help keep the public safe
