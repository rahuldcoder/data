@entity0 on friday apologized to gamers for leaving same - sex couples out of an upcoming " life simulation " game that lets players , flirt , date , marry and have children			1
the statement came as an online movement asking them to change " @entity12 " was picking up steam			0
" we apologize for disappointing many people by failing to include same - sex relationships in @entity12 ... , " the @entity15 company said in a news release			1
" at @entity0 , dedication has always meant going beyond the games to promote a sense of community , and to share a spirit of fun and joy			2
we are committed to advancing our longtime company values of fun and entertainment for everyone			0
" @entity30 , 23 , is a self - described @entity0 fanatic			1
the @entity33 , @entity34 , man was excited to learn that " @entity12 , " a version of a " life simulation " game previously only available in @entity15 , would be released in @entity38 for the @entity39 next month			0
he was less excited , however , when he learned that his in - game avatar -- or " @entity41 , " in @entity0 - speak -- could only be romantically involved with a female character , as opposed to one representing his real - life fianc√©			1
and , thus , was @entity45 born			0
launched last month , @entity47 's social - media campaign has begun picking up steam on @entity49 and @entity50 , where like - minded gamers are asking @entity0 to reconsider			2
" by excluding same - sex relationships in a game that 's focused around relationships like this one , they 're really excluding a lot of people , " @entity47 told @entity53 affiliate @entity52			1
in the game , players create or import their @entity41 ( pronounced " me " ) , which then can interact with characters that represent other real - world friends in their network			2
" the situation would n't be as big of a deal if it were n't for the fact that relationships and marriage are a huge part of the game , " @entity47 said in the video he created to announce his campaign			2
" the relationships and interactions between the @entity41 characters in the game , coupled with their relationships to you in real life , are what makes this game so appealing			0
... not being able to date and marry the gender that i 'm attracted to in real life really takes all of the immersion and fun out of it for me			0
" @entity0 said it 's too late to change the game , and that allowing same - sex couples would be too big and complicated of an update to release for it			1
but the company promised to do things differently next time			0
" we pledge that if we create a next installment in the @entity12 series , we will strive to design a game - play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive , and better represents all players , " the statement read			2
at a time when barriers to same - sex marriage are falling across the @entity110 , @entity0 's stance could have been a public relations problem for a company already facing slumping revenue amid weak sales for its @entity116 console			1
@entity47 acknowledged to @entity52 that " there are far greater concerns out there " than relationship options in a video game			0
but he noted that popular games like " @entity124 , " a life - simulation franchise launched by @entity126 in 2000 , have allowed same - sex relationships for years			1
@entity47 has specifically said he 's not calling for a boycott of the game , saying it would do more harm than good .			0
