-- hair in the black community is like a religion , resplendent with ritual , devotion , mythology , metaphor , plenty of pomp and circumstance			1
black hair arguably is one of the quickest indicators of ethnicity , ethos and sometimes , politics			1
this past week , two very different children found their very different " ethnic " hairstyles in the spotlight on two very different political stages			1
@entity21 , the son of @entity23 mayoral candidate @entity22 , is a typical nerdy , smart , shy 16 - year - old @entity24 boy			1
he has delighted @entity23 , late - night satirists and @entity26 with his charm and awesome afro			2
when the @entity31 's primary election was held , it garnered national attention at first largely because of the high - profile and high - drama candidate @entity33			2
yet , when it came to the tv campaign ads , liberal @entity22 stole the show			0
but it 's mostly not because of his @entity39 or i 'm - for - the - small - man messages ( although that matters )			2
it was because of his son @entity44 , who starred in a brilliant 30 - second straight no chaser ad			0
displaying a fluffy ' fro , he became a symbol for progress , acceptance , diversity and freedom			0
@entity44 and his gravity - defying , nonconformist hairstyle helped signal to @entity23 that his father , @entity22 , understands equality , empathizes with the victims of systemic bigotry and is more than qualified to lead the most diverse metropolis in @entity26			0
@entity60 finished first in the primary , though it is not clear whether he will have to face a runoff against @entity64 for the @entity66 nomination			0
going natural in corporate america to some black voters , @entity44 's afro reflected that this boy and by association his father , respected the civil rights struggle , since the afro is considered an icon for black pride and progress			1
in other words -- you can trust @entity22 to be sensitive to issues of race that affect @entity23 , most notably the controversial stop - and - frisk policy			0
and to white voters and others , @entity44 's afro was just cool			1
but while @entity44 's afro is being celebrated , in a different part of @entity26 last week a little girl in @entity87 , @entity88 , was reprimanded because her hairstyle violated the policy of her charter school			1
@entity93 , a pretty , sweet , shy 7 - year - old @entity94 girl with a big bow over her dreadlocks was criticized because at the @entity97 where she is a student , " hairstyles such as dreadlocks , afros , @entity101 and other faddish styles " were not permitted			1
when the tearful @entity93 hit the tv news cycle , many people were heartbroken watching her			2
according to news reports , she was told that her perfectly neat little locks " did n't look presentable			0
" this is certainly not the first time that dreadlocks have been banned from schools but it was one of the most emotional instances			0
so much so that more than 20,000 people signed a petition demanding that @entity97 publicly apologizes to @entity93 and her family			2
@entity117 's parents pulled her out of the charter school and placed her in a new school where hopefully she can lead a hair hassle - free childhood			2
( @entity97 has since apologized and removed the language about @entity124 hairstyles from its dress code			0
) why focus on @entity128 ' hair ? @entity93 's experience , for many , is a symbol that ignorance and bias still pervades @entity124 life			1
the fact that in her natural state , her hair was viewed as rebellious , signals that there is a lot of misperception that we must correct			0
one way to fix this is for mainstream media to champion more diverse images of black beauty			0
black hair is a repository for @entity26 's painful past and promising future			1
the endless style possibilities of black hair represent @entity26 's creative genius , yet its " otherness " is a constant reminder of unresolved inequalities and subtle prejudices			1
let 's hope that one day , hairstyles from the black community will no longer trigger powerful emotions or suspicions			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			0

@entity166 : two very different children found their hair in the spotlight this past week
@entity171 : while @entity21 's afro won hearts , @entity93 's dreadlocks got criticized
she says the " otherness " of black hair is a reminder that there is still bias to *overcome*
@entity171 : let 's hope one day black hairstyles wo n't trigger powerful emotions or suspicions
