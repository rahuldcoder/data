-- when it comes to the following tourist destinations , the trick will be getting there before the wrecking ball does			1
limestone pinnacles do not make @entity7 a pinnacle of success in the tourism business			1
@entity7 this tiny island in the @entity11 may soon be completely uninhabitable , and it 's all because the locals forgot to follow the boy scout motto : be prepared			2
since the turn of the 20th century , @entity7 has been one of the world 's prime sources for phosphate , a mineral compound formed over time from bird excrement , and an important ingredient in fertilizer			2
phosphate mining quickly made @entity7 rich , and at one point , the island even boasted the world 's second - highest per capita gdp			2
but , as it turns out , basing your entire economy on dung can have its drawbacks			2
for one thing , phosphate is a limited resource			2
by 2000 , many believed the island 's supply had dried up			2
in fact , all mining ceased until the government managed to hunt down the last few traces of the mineral in 2006			2
but the phosphate will soon be gone , leaving @entity7 without a profitable export and without decent , farmable land			1
that 's because phosphate runs in veins throughout the limestone and coral foundation of the island			2
to collect it , miners have to rip up the ground , leaving pillars and pits of less - valuable land behind			1
about four - fifths of the island is now ravaged to the point that no crops can grow and no one can inhabit it			2
worse , the ruined landscape collects heat , which ends up creating a pattern of warm air that prevents rain clouds from forming			2
currently , @entity7 imports almost all its food and water , and there do n't seem to be any industries poised to replace mining once the phosphate is gone			2
the @entity73 the @entity73 is famous for being the lowest point on @entity75 ( an ear - popping 1,400 feet below sea level ) and for being so salty that humans naturally float on top of it			1
but in recent years , it 's also become famous for the tremendous rate at which it 's evaporating			1
currently , the @entity83 recedes about 3 feet each year , leaving ever - growing plains of salty , puckered , sinkhole - prone dirt in its wake			1
to really understand the phenomenon , tourists need only visit the @entity89			2
when it opened 20 years ago , you could step out the back door and be within a few feet of the salty water			1
but today , the @entity83 has receded so much that the trek to its shore amounts to a 1 - mile hike			0
the @entity73 's imminent demise is also due to its neighbors ' need for water			1
for the past several decades , @entity101 , @entity102 , and @entity103 have been siphoning off more and more of the @entity104 -- the @entity73 's primary water source			1
growing populations and increased agriculture now require so much hydration that the @entity104 is barely a trickle of its former self			0
several solutions have been suggested , but the most promising is a canal that would funnel water from the @entity114 to the @entity115			0
the only problem is that the plan relies on @entity101 , @entity118 , and @entity104 engaging in long - term friendly relations -- something that may not happen in time to save the treasured landmark			0
@entity122 we 've all felt that " sinking " feeling in the pit of our stomachs before , but imagine having it under the soles of your shoes -- all the time			1
that 's part of life in @entity122 , which is built on the site of a former lake			1
in fact , the city was originally built on the lake , via a series of @entity140 - designed aquatic platforms			0
@entity144 as that was , the @entity142 conquerors who tore through the land in the 16th century preferred a more traditional approach to urbanization , so they drained the lake and built a @entity150 - style city in the empty basin			1
almost immediately , this proved to be a poor idea			0
foundations sank into the soft clay and left many buildings tilting at odd angles			0
that alone might have made @entity122 just a little eccentric -- charming , even			1
but as its population ballooned during the 20th century , the government had to search for new sources of water			0
officials ended up pumping much of the city 's supply out of the underground aquifer that had once fed the lake , which amounted to yet another bad idea			0
as the aquifer emptied , the soft clay above sank faster and deeper			0
in the past century , @entity122 has sunk more than 30 feet			1
even worse , there 's no clear , practical plan today for how to stop the droop and still provide water for the area 's 22 million people			0
we suggest you run for the border with a camera and click some pics while you still can			0
@entity181 do n't get us wrong ; in 20 years , there will still be @entity181 people , and there will still be places known as " @entity186			1
" but , chances are , both will be very different from their traditional versions			0
the @entity181 , who originally emigrated from @entity150 in the 18th century , are most closely associated with farming and a technology - free lifestyle			1
and while the community has valued its isolation since the 1970s , those cultural norms have been shifting			0
the key culprit ? the ever - skyrocketing price of land			1
@entity181 families typically have an average of seven children , which translates to a fast - growing population -- a population that 's running out of room to expand			1
because rural regions have become more popular with average @entity208 , many places that were farmland 20 years ago are now subdivisions , factories , and office complexes ( not to mention a fair share of @entity181 tourist condos )			1
basically , the @entity214 need more land , but that land is now scarcer and more expensive			1
so what 's a separatist religious community to do ? in many cases , the answer has been " become less separatist			0
" today , a majority of @entity181 do n't rely on farming as their sole source of income			1
many have side businesses , often connected with the tourism industry , and some @entity181 have even taken jobs in non-amish owned factories , making the old life increasingly difficult to maintain			1
@entity231 the area now known as @entity231 was originally a military base meant to defend one of the main waterways into the @entity237 capital of @entity238			0
but in 1971 , it was captured by an invasion force nobody in the @entity237 military expected -- hippies			0
at the time , the base was n't being used , so it was pretty easy for a gaggle of unarmed characters to take over			0
beyond simply staging a short - term sit - in , the group hunkered down for the long haul and declared the abandoned base its own autonomous country			0
with little resistance from @entity237 's tolerant government , the residents of @entity231 spent the next several years building a society where all property is collectively owned , all decisions are made by painstaking group consensus , and all marijuana is openly grown and sold			0
through the years , the hippies became entrepreneurs as well -- founding businesses , opening cafes and music venues , and even inventing and marketing a transport bicycle perfect for moving large loads through @entity231 's car - free streets			0
despite its status as one of @entity238 's top tourist attractions , @entity231 's days may be numbered			1
since 2004 , the newly elected conservative government has been cracking down on the hippie enclave -- first by staging a major drug bust and , more recently , by instituting a redevelopment plan for the land ( which is still , technically , federal property )			1
one major change tentatively approved by @entity231 residents in april 2007 would turn the @entity279 into a regular public housing association and greatly increase rents			0
according to the @entity283 , adult @entity282 previously paid about $ 45 a month into a common fund to live there			0
now , they 'll have to pay the government closer to $ 800 a month			0
in addition , the plan gives the government the authority to tear down some hippie - built homes and replace them with ( gasp ! ) condos			0
