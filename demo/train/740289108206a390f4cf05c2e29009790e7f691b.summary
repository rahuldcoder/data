-- when it comes to airline alliances , there is safety and profitability in numbers -- even more so as the industry tries to stave off the worst effects of the @entity9 and sluggish recovery , where we have seen mergers and code share agreements			0
all the major @entity15 airlines are part of one of the three big alliances			2
there is @entity20 ( the biggest ) based around @entity21 and @entity22 ; @entity23 based around @entity25 / @entity24 and @entity26 ; and @entity27 based around @entity28 and @entity29			2
alliances are a key part of the aviation industry			2
according to @entity27 ceo @entity37 , 86 % of the revenue from travel between the world 's top 100 cities business is booked with alliances			1
" passengers who travel for business are heavily invested in alliances carriers , " he says			2
@entity27 has marked a milestone in airline alliance history with its newest member @entity45 being the first @entity46 carrier to join an alliance			1
competition between the " @entity49 " ( @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity45 ) is rife and now that @entity52 has made this bold step to join @entity27 , the impact of @entity46 carriers on the industry and the relationships they choose to forge are being followed more closely than ever before , to see how airlines and alliances will respond			1
see also : @entity46 hubs become travel hotspots " as more airlines are aligned and more consolidation occurs , alliances actually end up competing for members in some ways , " said @entity37 , ceo of the @entity27 alliance			1
" now that more and more airlines belong , the tension between them has grown			0
" for other @entity46 carriers , a cosy codeshare with different alliances is as far as they 'll go			1
@entity50 has codeshare agreements with @entity27 carrier @entity77 and , most recently , with @entity20 member @entity78			1
@entity23 welcomes @entity25 's partnership with @entity51 and @entity81 , where @entity51 owns 29 % of the @entity83 airline			0
" @entity46 carriers and their hubs are well - positioned geographically for a number of major traffic flows , both within the @entity89 itself and between other continents " said @entity84 , ceo of @entity23			1
" these @entity46 carriers have developed substantial capacity with high transfer capabilities , making these airlines and their hubs relevant players in aviation today , both in terms of industry developments and possible further consolidation , " he added			1
although @entity51 has not joined an alliance , @entity23 member @entity25 says it 's a case of " if you ca n't beat'em , join'em			0
" " when you see geographically the way the world is built , @entity46 carriers bring significant improvement to the alliances , " said @entity107 , president and ceo of @entity25 in an exclusive interview with @entity0 -- his first international television appearance since being appointed			1
watch video : @entity51 rejects airline alliances when asked about doing business with @entity81 -- which is a member of a rival alliance @entity27 -- @entity107 candidly said : " in the future if our ties with @entity51 and @entity81 become closer , @entity81 will have to make a decision about which alliance they want to belong to			1
the decision is in their hands			0
" @entity81 , @entity83 's second largest carrier after @entity21 , has only been a member of @entity27 since march last year and if it were ever to leave , the alliance would n't let it go quietly			2
" we would regret it very deeply if @entity81 left @entity27 , " says @entity37			2
" we like @entity81 and they add a lot of value to us and we think we add a lot of value to them , by the way			0
" it would be easier if we had exclusive clubs and we said ' if you join my club you ca n't use any other club , ' but this is the airline business and it 's completely impractical			0
we would be sad to see them leave			0
i would definitely put up a fight if i thought it were necessary			0
" watch video : ' @entity151 ' shake up global aviation @entity20 is monitoring this relationship closely , especially because its chief member , @entity21 , is the only major @entity15 airline that has n't teamed up with a @entity46 carrier			1
even so , @entity20 says it does n't feel left out or threatened			2
" we 're the only global alliance that flies to all of the countries in the @entity161 and we really have no aspirations to have one of the carriers in the @entity46 join our alliance , " says @entity157 , ceo for @entity20 , which has 27 members			1
he adds : " fifteen years of @entity20 , 21,900 flights a day , 192 countries , 1,330 cities we fly to -- we have @entity169 in the vicinity , also @entity166 , so we 're not feeling any kind of commercial pressure			0
" and for airlines like south - east @entity178 's @entity177 , which are too small for it to be worth their while joining an alliance , the best way to compete is not to compete			0
" i think you have to cut your cloth in this industry , " says @entity177 deputy chairman @entity179			0
" the @entity46 carriers have put a lot of capacity into the region over the last five - six years and that 's had an impact on all the airlines , especially the kangaroo traffic between the @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192			1
" we 've cut capacity , we closed routes to @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196			0
we are backing off competing against the @entity46 carriers and focusing on what we do best -- @entity198			1
that way we can happily co-exist with the @entity46 carriers			2
" according to the @entity201 , airlines were expected to return a profit of $ 6.7 billion at the end of 2012 , only slightly improving to $ 8.4 billion in 2013			0
adding capacity and connecting continents , @entity46 carriers will continue to play a crucial role in helping airlines and alliances expand their networks , filling their geographical gaps			1
