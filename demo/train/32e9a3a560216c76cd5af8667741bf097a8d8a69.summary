@entity0 -- president @entity3 's poll numbers are nothing to brag about , but there 's little evidence he has suffered so far this year a " @entity8 moment " that caused his predecessor 's numbers to plummet			1
a new @entity1 / @entity12 survey indicates that public opinion of the president has barely budged in the wake of new challenges that @entity3 has faced this year			1
according to the poll , which was released wednesday , the president 's approval rating among @entity19 stands at 42 %			1
that 's not great , but it 's basically unchanged since march			0
only 42 % believe that @entity3 can manage the government effectively			1
again , nothing to celebrate , but it 's virtually unchanged from the 43 % who felt that way in march			2
" when @entity8 devastated @entity30 and the @entity31 in 2005 , the biggest impact on attitudes toward @entity29 came in the number who said that he could manage the government effectively			0
that number dropped 10 points , and no other personal quality measured at that time changed as much , " said @entity1 polling director @entity35			1
" using that as a definition of a ' @entity8 moment , ' it looks like @entity3 has not experienced a similar drop in the summer of 2014 , in part because his numbers already took that hit last year and have stabilized since then			0
" the survey indicates there have been one - to - two point changes ( which are within the poll 's sampling error ) in the number of @entity19 who say that @entity3 is a strong leader , that he shares their values and that he cares about people			2
" once again , those numbers are not good news for the @entity56 , but the clear indication is that the president 's problems pre-date the current immigration crisis along the @entity62 border or anything else that has happened this summer , and that those problems have not made things significantly worse for the president , " @entity35 added			1
@entity3 drop started last year @entity3 's numbers edged down during the late spring and summer of 2013 following controversies over the @entity72 intelligence leaks and congressional investigations into the @entity75 ' alleged targeting of conservative political groups			1
then came october and the politically charged botched rollout of the website for @entity79 , his signature domestic policy achievement			0
coupled with legislative setbacks , many pundits labeled 2013 the worst year of @entity3 's presidency			2
and for the first time since taking over at the @entity56 in 2009 , a majority of the public surveyed disapproved of his job performance			0
@entity3 's approval ratings slightly rebounded earlier this year before edging down to their current standing in the low 40s in most national public opinion polling			1
the release of the new @entity1 poll comes after the crisis along the southern border dominated headlines for weeks			2
prior to that controversy , the scandal rocking the @entity98 was in the media spotlight			0
the president is also facing two pressing international challenges : the bloody fighting in @entity104 between @entity105 and @entity106 , and the shooting down of a @entity109 airliner over a part of eastern @entity111 controlled by @entity113 separatists			0
prior to these two international flashpoints , @entity3 was dealing with the increased bloodshed in @entity116 , the ongoing civil war in @entity118 , as well as the controversial swapping of five @entity121 prisoners held at @entity122 for the release of a @entity19 soldier held captive in @entity125			0
the poll was conducted for @entity1 by @entity12 from july 18 - 20 , with 1,012 adult americans questioned by telephone			2
the survey 's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points .			0

president @entity3 's approval rating is 42 % in new @entity1 / @entity12 poll
his approval rating stood at 43 % in a poll in march
" president 's problems pre-date the current immigration crisis " @entity1 polling director says
big drop in @entity3 's approval rating happened during 2013
