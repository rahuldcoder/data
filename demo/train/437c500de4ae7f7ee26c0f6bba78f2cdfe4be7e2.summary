-- @entity2 's stunning extra-time header gave @entity3 his first trophy as @entity6 coach on wednesday , winning the @entity7 final 1 - 0 against arch - rivals @entity8			1
@entity6 went to @entity9 seeking a first @entity7 triumph since 1993 , and the 42nd goal this season by the world 's most expensive player handed the club an 18th success in the competition			1
the @entity19 captain rose high at the far post to power in a 103rd - minute effort from a teasing cross by @entity24 , who was sent off for a second booking at the end of the second spell of extra time			2
it was @entity2 's second goal in two games against @entity8 , having netted a late equalizing penalty in saturday 's 1 - 1 draw that left the @entity34 eight points clear in @entity36			1
is @entity6 's @entity3 the master of mind games ? @entity3 employed the defensive midfield formation he used in that second " @entity46 " clash this season between the two teams , who will meet again in the semifinals of the @entity45 next wednesday			2
the tactic paid off as @entity6 had the better of the first half of regulation play , and converted midfielder @entity50 came closest to breaking the deadlock with a thumping header that hit the post in the 44th minute			0
@entity8 battled back into the game in the second half , and had the ball in the net with 69 minutes gone but @entity58 was ruled to have been marginally offside as he gathered a superb pass from @entity60			0
captain @entity61 then saved real with superb efforts to deny @entity60 and @entity58 in rapid succession , and the match went to extra time			2
ten - man @entity6 deny @entity8 in @entity46 @entity6 waited for counter-attacking opportunities , and the first came in the 98th minute as @entity2 raced clear before driving just wide of @entity70 's far post			1
but he made no mistake five minutes later as @entity24 combined well down the left with @entity73 and delivered the perfect cross			0
the @entity75 departed the scene in time added on , but @entity8 did not make anything of the resulting free - kick and @entity81 's team -- seeking an overall 26th triumph -- could not force a penalty shootout			0
it gave @entity3 his first victory over @entity8 since taking charge at @entity6 , and went some way to avenging the 5 - 0 thrashing at the @entity88 in the first half of the season			1
he has now won a trophy in every country in which he has coached -- his native @entity19 , @entity93 , @entity94 and now @entity95			0
meanwhile , @entity96 had to come from behind to secure a 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity99 in the first leg of their @entity102 semifinal on wednesday			1
@entity103 put @entity96 ahead in the fourth minute on the day he failed to overturn a three - match @entity105 ban for swearing in the direction of a linesman			0
the @entity110 striker , who missed saturday 's 3 - 0 win over @entity112 that put @entity96 six points clear in the league , volleyed home from close range at the far post from @entity118 's deep cross			1
@entity75 forward @entity119 leveled 10 minutes later after combining well with @entity120 , and young @entity122 strike partner @entity121 followed up his weekend double from the win over @entity124 to make it 2 - 1 in the 53rd minute with a fierce shot that went in off the crossbar			2
however , @entity127 equalized with 14 minutes to play after @entity103 ran into the box and the ball ran loose to the @entity130			0
@entity119 could have restored @entity99 's lead ahead of the second leg in @entity133 on may 10 but goalkeeper @entity134 made a fine save to deny him			0
cup holders @entity135 will take a 1 - 0 lead into the may 11 home leg of their semi against @entity124 after @entity139 scored the only goal at the @entity141 on tuesday in a repeat scoreline of last year 's final .			1

@entity6 win @entity7 for the 18th time , beating @entity8 1 - 0 final
@entity2 scores the only goal in @entity9 , heading home in extra time
@entity3 lifts his first trophy with @entity6 ahead of @entity45 semis
@entity96 held to a 2 - 2 draw at home by @entity99 in first leg of @entity102 semifinal
