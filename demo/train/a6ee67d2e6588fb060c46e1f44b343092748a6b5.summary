@entity1 , @entity0 -- leaving school at 16 is not normally the route to success			1
but @entity6 did just that , setting up a magazine and then entering the record business			1
now his brand is behind more than 300 companies -- from cola to trains , from phones to planes making @entity17 a global name			1
soon @entity17 will reach galactic proportions			2
in 2009 @entity6 hopes to take tourists into space			2
@entity2 's @entity21 caught up with the billionaire in @entity1 and asked what drives him to create such a diverse enterprise			1
@entity25 : what drives me to create a lot of different businesses is simply a feeling that we can , most likely , do it better than other people in particular areas			0
we wo n't create a business if somebody else is doing it really well , the only time we 'll create one is if it 's not being done well			0
@entity21 : how would you describe your own personality ? @entity25 : i love people , i love to learn			2
i never went to university so i see my life as one long university education i never had			0
i 'm very inquisitive , hence the fact we 've gone to 350 different businesses , which is quite unusual for a western company			0
@entity21 : you run your companies as a series of independent companies			2
what do you look for in your key lieutenants ? @entity25 : number one , the @entity17 brand is absolutely paramount , they must do nothing to damage the reputation of the brand			1
and the second thing is to look after their team of people			0
@entity21 : your headmaster when you left high school said to you '' @entity6 , congratulations , i predict you 'll either go to prison or become a millionaire			1
'' what was it in your character that you think made him make that observation ? @entity25 : well i suspect the fact that at age 13 i 'm writing him letters on how he could organize the catering better and how the school could save money , and if they save money they could then put it into better facilities for the students			0
and i managed to persuade him to give me a study to start my magazine and it was only when he actually finally came to me and said " look , you 're either going to have to do your school work or your magazine , " that i said " well , goodbye			1
i 'm off to do the magazine , but thanks very much			0
" @entity21 : in your autobiography you write about being four - years - old and your mother stops the car and makes you get out and what does she make you do ? @entity25 : we were on the way to my grandmother 's house in @entity104 , and i think about three miles before we got there she made me get out and told me to find my own way to my grandmother 's house			2
basically , her approach was to try and get us to stand on our own two feet and she went to extreme measures sometimes to do so			0
@entity21 : without your persona do you think the @entity17 brand could have ever become what it became ? @entity25 : i think the particular @entity17 brand perhaps needed me , in the past , to get out there and be adventurous , and therefore to give the brand an adventurous feeling ; take on the big guys , which we did , and beat the big guys and that 's what 's created the @entity17 brand			1
i think now if my balloon pops , or the space ship just continues to go into space , or whatever , i think the brand is strong enough to withstand all that and it 'll continue to grow			0
