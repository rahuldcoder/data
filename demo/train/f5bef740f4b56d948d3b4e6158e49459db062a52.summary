@entity0 -- who is @entity3 ? among friends , he 's just one of the guys			1
when the @entity6 gained majority power in the @entity8 tuesday , the man poised to lead them was brought to tears			1
that evening , rep. @entity3 of @entity12 , who will soon become the new speaker of the @entity8 , told supporters , " i spent my whole life chasing the @entity17 dream			1
" with tears forming and his voice quavering , @entity3 recounted details of his life growing up in southwestern @entity12 : " i started out mopping floors , waiting tables and tending bar at my dad 's tavern			1
i put myself through school , working every rotten job there was and every night shift i could find			2
" while it 's a story of humble beginnings -- @entity3 worked as a janitor in college -- it 's a long way from the image many have of him today , as a @entity0 insider known for a ubiquitous tan , an unstoppable smoking habit and fiery speeches on the @entity8 floor			1
one of @entity3 's friends , @entity43 , who has known the 60 - year - old , 10 - term congressman since seventh grade , told @entity48 's career continues to surprise childhood friends			1
" it was nothing that any of us would ever have expected , " said @entity43 , president of a @entity51 , @entity12 , candle company			0
" we would have expected him more to be successful in business , the way he was , more than get into the political field			0
" " i ca n't say that there was anything that made him outstanding to me in grade school			0
he was just one of the guys , " @entity43 said			0
@entity3 is the second of 12 children			1
" the thing i remember most about going to his house was there was always diapers on the line , " recalled @entity43			0
" no matter what time of year it was , they were either outside or inside , but his mom always had cloth diapers			0
there were so many kids running around			0
" @entity3 is the first in his family to graduate from college			2
earning a degree in business from @entity84 , @entity3 eventually became president of @entity86 , a plastics and packaging company			2
@entity3 began his political career in the 1980s , serving in the @entity12 state legislature			2
he won his first congressional race in 1990			0
twenty years later , longtime friends reject the idea that he has turned into a @entity0 elitist who 's too chummy with lobbyists			2
@entity96 , president and ceo of the @entity98 and himself a registered lobbyist , has known @entity3 since he first ran for @entity101			1
he said the image of an insider as someone who is " co-opted by the system " and becomes " someone that you were n't when you came here " does n't describe the congressman			0
" you know , i think he 's still @entity3 , " he said			1
" there 's no substitute for having run a business , " @entity96 said			0
" it 's completely different if you 've only signed the back of a paycheck and you 've never signed the front			0
" during @entity3 's time in @entity101 , he 's also earned a reputation among reporters and colleagues as having a laid - back demeanor and a penchant for wisecracks			1
on thursday , when questioned by @entity130 's @entity129 about the possibility of a " @entity132 " with president @entity133 , @entity3 responded , " i do n't know about a slurpee			1
how about a glass of merlot ? " " we were angels , and that 's the way we 'll keep it , " said @entity43 when asked if @entity3 learned to joke around while attending an all - boys high school in @entity12			1
and while friends do n't recall @entity3 as someone who easily sheds tears , they say the recent public displays of emotion are genuine			2
" it 's sincere , " said @entity43			0
" i think he 's seeing that he has a chance to realize that dream , that goal that he put out there			0

rep. @entity3 , @entity153 , soon will take over as speaker of the @entity8
@entity3 was emotional the night the @entity6 *swept* to power in the @entity8
he recounted his humble beginnings and hard work " chasing the @entity160 "
he 's still the same man he was when he came to @entity101 , a close friend says
