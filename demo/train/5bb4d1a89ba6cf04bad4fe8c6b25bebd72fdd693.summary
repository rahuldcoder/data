-- @entity2 's governing body has outlawed a technological development which would help teams improve the stability and aerodynamics of a car			1
the @entity8 ( @entity8 ) took the decision to ban reactive ride - height systems for the 2012 season , with teams such as @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 thought to be developing their own versions of the innovation			1
@entity2 's official website reported on monday that the @entity8 informed the 12 teams of its decision to ban the technology -- which helps stop the car dipping closer to the track under the pressure of braking -- last week			1
