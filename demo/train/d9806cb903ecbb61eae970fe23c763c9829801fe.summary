-- a man from @entity2 got into the habit of leaving his wife little notes			2
nothing elaborate -- just sweet sentiments like " i love you " or " i ca n't wait to get home to you tonight , " jotted down on post-it notes and then hidden in places where he knew she 'd stumble over them throughout the course of her day			1
you can say " i love you " by giving your time and attention to people in need			1
she 'd open a drawer or reach into a kitchen cabinet and find a hidden note			2
from inside the dog food bin , to the laundry hamper , to the driver 's seat of her car , the notes were everywhere			2
he was in the military and he was shipped out during the early days of the war in @entity35 , where he was killed in action			2
on the morning of the funeral , his young widow put on her winter coat , placed her hands in her pockets , and found the last two notes which he had hidden there for her before he had left home			1
knowing exactly what they were , she slowly pulled them out of her pockets			2
the first one read , " i will always love you			1
" and the other read , " we will always be together			2
" did he know the circumstances under which she 'd find them ? it was hard to say			0
you can imagine the sorrow she felt as she read them , but think how lucky she was to have had a husband who managed to reach out with a final , loving gesture			0
like this wonderful man , all of us can create ways everyday that say , " i love you			1
" i know it 's almost @entity71 , and we have come to think of only this day as love day but instead , i am suggesting that we think of every day as an opportunity to put a little love in the world			1
there is an old saying that goes something like this , " @entity77 does n't make the world go round , but it sure makes the ride worth while			0
" you see , real joy and true happiness are found when we tell someone we care and show them how special they are in our lives			1
when i say love , i do not only mean the kind where two people are locking lips and coming up for air every 10 minutes or so			1
i am talking about the kind of love that embraces everyone who has a presence in our lives			1
the kind of love i am talking about extends throughout our circle of life , touching family , friends and co-workers			1
@entity0 how to show your loved ones you care i am talking about the kind of love where a woman gives her birthday bouquet away to a co- worker because the co-worker has had some rough financial times and can not afford to purchase a gift for her niece			1
the woman believes her birthday bouquet will be even more special when the co-worker gives it to her niece			0
@entity118 , when everyone at a hair salon contributes to making a quilt for their friend who has just been diagnosed with ovarian cancer			1
the quilt was filled with their well wishes and served as their own special way to cover their sick friend with love			1
an act of love is present when a woman grows out her red silky hair , just so that it could be pulled back in a pony tail and cut to be donated to @entity137 , a company that makes beautiful wigs for women who have lost their hair to chemotherapy treatments as they battle cancer			2
love is also found within a retired woman who decides to raise money so she can go to @entity146 where she can best tend to and take care of orphaned children who are affected by @entity149 and @entity150			1
we all know stories like these and we each have our own stories to tell , to inspire us and remind us what really matters			1
it is in these acts of kindness where the joy of living is found			1
these acts of love are everywhere , and when we turn our eyes and hearts to them , they touch and change our lives forever			1
defining what love is has been the work of poets and philosophers throughout time , but it 's our job too			2
it is something we all know when we feel it , but words simply are not adequate enough to define it			0
love is so many things -- a feeling , an intention and a thank you			2
it is compassionate , it is generous , it is funny , it is serious , it breaks our hearts and yet it heals all things			0
love is expressed in a trillion ways , it is found in a smile , blowing a kiss , a wink , a song , a poem , a word or even a batch of chocolate chip cookies			1
there is so much to say about love , but the heart of the matter is , we all want to be loved and we all want to love			2
@entity0 : great ways to celebrate @entity71 this @entity71 , remember that there are so many ways to say , " i love you			2
