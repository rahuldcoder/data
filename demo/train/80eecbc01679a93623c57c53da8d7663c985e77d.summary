-- @entity2 driver @entity1 insists @entity3 will bounce back from a disappointing start to 2013 , but the @entity5 has written off his team 's chances of competing for the world championship this season			1
the 2009 world champion started the year in confident mood after finishing the 2012 by winning the season - ending @entity13 @entity12			1
but the current campaign has been a miserable one for the @entity16 team , with @entity1 languishing 10th in the drivers ' standings after finishing 14th and out of the points at the recent @entity20 @entity12			2
however , @entity1 is confident @entity3 , one of the most successful teams in @entity2 history , will restore its reputation in the year 's remaining races and in the coming seasons			1
" clearly , we 'd hoped for more success this season , especially after last season , during which we won seven grands prix , including two of the last three , " the 33 - year - old told the sport 's official website			1
" so , going forward , as i say , we 'd hoped for more this season , but i firmly believe that there 'll be good seasons ahead for us			0
" a fifth - place finish is the best @entity1 has been able to muster in seven races this season			1
there have also been reports of friction between @entity1 and @entity48 teammate @entity47 , the 23 - year - old known as " @entity49 " who arrived as a replacement for @entity52 , now at @entity53			1
" @entity54 is a very nice lad , " said @entity1			2
" maybe he 's a bit too forceful sometimes , by his own admission , but he 's undoubtedly quick , and he 's still learning because you never stop learning in this game			0
" he 's trying to make his mark -- but i think that 's how it should be			0
" your teammate is never going to be your best friend , because people will always compare your performance with his and inevitably you want to emerge positively from that comparison , but @entity54 and i get on well -- and that is more than you can say about some teammate relationships these days ! @entity1 is hoping @entity3 's impending partnership with engine supplier @entity71 -- set to come into effect from 2015 onwards -- can propel the team back towards the front of the grid			1
originally partners between 1988 and 1992 , @entity3 and @entity71 won multiple drivers ' and constructors ' titles with legendary names like @entity81 and @entity82			2
" in 2004 , @entity3 won only one grand prix , but it won 10 grands prix in 2005 , in 2006 @entity3 won no grands prix , but it won eight grands prix in 2007 , " explained the former @entity84 driver			0
" so i think history shows us that @entity3 will win again , well and often , and , as i say , i reckon the next @entity3 - @entity71 era could be very exciting indeed			2
" earlier this year @entity1 said he intends to stay with @entity3 until he retires , although he is not considering when that may be			1
" i 've had a great career , " he added			0
" i 've won 15 grands prix and one world championship			0
i intend to do quite a bit more winning in the future			0
as to how many years that future may reach forwards to , i have n't decided yet			0

@entity1 backs @entity3 to *recover* from a low - key start to 2013
the @entity5 's *highest* finish from this year 's seven races is fifth in @entity104
@entity1 insists his relationship with teammate @entity47 is good
the 2009 world champion is not considering retiring
