-- it 's arguably the toughest job in sports			2
hockey enforcers earn the undying devotion of fans -- but not much else -- for their ability to punch and get punched on skates			2
they usually bounce from team to team , barely managing to get a contract for a role few can perform well and no one else wants			2
" i did it because it was my job but i hated it , " said @entity14 , one of the most successful hockey heavyweights in his 12 - year @entity17 career			1
" i hated to fight			2
i hated to be called a goon , and an animal			2
" @entity14 spoke to the @entity26 radio program in @entity27 after the news wednesday that another former enforcer , @entity29 , was found dead in his @entity31 apartment at age 35			1
authorities described the death as nonsuspicious			0
it was the third death of a current or former @entity17 enforcer this summer , an almost unfathomable statistical anomaly			1
there are 30 @entity17 teams , and not all of them employ a so - called " hired gun " these days , both to intimidate opposing players and keep them honest			1
@entity45 was found dead at age 28 in his @entity48 home in may , the result of a toxic combination of painkillers and alcohol ruled an accident			1
@entity45 , one of the most feared @entity17 fighters at 6 - foot - 7 and 265 pounds -- he was known as the @entity55 , had n't played in months while trying to recover from concussions sustained in on - ice bouts			1
in august , 27 - year - old @entity58 was found dead in his home in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity27			1
no official cause has been announced , but @entity58 had a history of depression and was on personal leave from the @entity66 for much of last season			0
he signed a contract with the @entity69 for the coming season			0
@entity71 : full coverage of the @entity17 @entity29 's death this week stunned former teammates , who described him as a happy - go - lucky man always cracking jokes , even at his own expense			1
at 6 - foot - 5 and well over 200 pounds , @entity29 developed into a feared heavyweight over a 14 - year career with five teams			1
he retired from the league last season and was trying to start a broadcasting career			1
he was chosen to participate in the coming season of " @entity84 , " a @entity27 version of " @entity86 " on skates			0
while few answers regarding @entity29 's death have emerged so far , @entity14 provided some insight in describing the life of the hockey enforcer			1
the worst part is not the fighting itself , he said , because the adrenaline kicks in and you do n't feel the blows			1
instead , what weighs heaviest is the constant pressure of knowing you will have to fight another enforcer such as @entity45 or @entity29 , game after game , according to @entity14			1
" it 's the night before , the day of the game , before it starts , " he said			0
" it 's the shivers that it gives you , the worry in the head and the brain			0
it 's when you go to a movie and you ca n't watch it because you 're thinking the next game about having to fight @entity45 or someone like that			0
or you do n't feel well , but something happens and you have to go out there			0
... it 's that pressure that 's nonstop that you live with			0
" for that reason , he said , enforcers past and present have " demons " they live with , and often turn to alcohol to deal with them			0
in addition , enforcers do n't earn the multimillion - dollar salaries of top scorers , defensemen or goalies , @entity14 noted			0
" for as many years that they played , many of those guys did n't make much money , so there are not options for them afterwards , " @entity14 said			0
" you have to fight to live when life after hockey is over , and there 's nothing for you			0
" to @entity147 , the longtime captain of the @entity148 , " it 's an adjustment from the high - profile life you live to go back to everyday ( life ) , i guess			0
" such a spate of deaths among former enforcers , however , raises questions about whether such players are particularly vulnerable to the pressures of life -- either the physical grind of concussions and punches to the head , or the mental strain described by @entity14			1
when former @entity17 enforcer @entity162 died suddenly last year at age 45 , researchers discovered he had @entity164 , a degenerative brain disease			1
@entity162 , a legendary tough guy who had a history of alcohol and drug abuse , died of heart failure while on a family boat outing			0
a joint @entity17 / @entity17 @entity171 behavioral program exists to help players dealing with personal problems , including substance abuse and other issues			1
after @entity58 's death last month , described by @entity27 police as a " nonsuspicious sudden death , " @entity17 commissioner @entity176 said he expected the program to be reviewed			1
" my guess is we 'll talk at the appropriate time with the players ' association , making sure that we 're comfortable with all of the mechanisms and programs we have in place , which are extensive , " @entity176 told @entity181 then			1
" i do n't think any sports league does more than we do , but maybe there 's more , as we focus on it , that we need to focus on			2
i know it 's always hard for people to accept , but sports is a microcosm of society in general			0
and life is n't always easy			0
" especially for hockey enforcers			0
despite his hatred for the brawling in his career , @entity14 said he would always support allowing fighting in hockey			2
hockey is the only team sport that allows two players to fight without getting ejected for the rest of the game , and @entity14 said that element allows players to police themselves and prevent more violent stick fouls and other mayhem			2
" guys like me , if there 's no fighting , we wo n't be making a living , " he said			2
" as tough and as hard as it is , i 'll always be defending that job			0
" removing fighting from the game means denying opportunity for kids who dream of an @entity17 career , just as he did			1
to realize his dream , he became an enforcer , explaining : " i did that because i knew that 's what i had to do			0

@entity29 , who retired this year , is found dead at age 35
he is the third @entity17 player known for fighting to die in recent months
the league has a program to help players with behavioral problems
