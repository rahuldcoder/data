@entity0 , the 32 - year - old gunman who attacked the @entity2 parliament and killed a soldier last week , had a familiar profile			1
it is that of a young man alienated from mainstream society , with few friends , without a steady job , drifting from one place to another -- often with a history of petty crime and drug abuse			1
then comes the conversion to or rediscovery of @entity18 , and the adoption of a jihadist mindset , fed by media and online coverage of the @entity24 's involvement in wars in @entity26 and @entity27 , and by the well - oiled propaganda machine of groups like @entity30			1
whether these young men acting alone ( and they are almost always men ) should be better described as " lone - wolf " terrorists or deranged criminals is debatable			1
" there is no single , universally accepted definition of terrorism , " says the @entity35			2
in many cases , their conversion to militant @entity18 is about seeking identity and purpose , or even a sense of adventure			1
few of these men have a deep understanding of @entity47 , the deeply conservative brand of @entity18 that 's the philosophical underpinning of groups like @entity50 , and jihad ; their writings are often incoherent			1
frequently they see radical @entity18 as a form of redemption from past misdeeds , one that also feeds an existing animosity toward authority and a sense of being " on the outside			1
" they blame " kuffar " ( nonbeliever ) societies for corrupting them in the first place			2
analysis of the backgrounds of dozens of young men who have embraced militant @entity18 and eventually planned or carried out an act of violence shows that many have had troubled upbringings -- although there is no evidence they are more likely to come from poor than comfortable backgrounds			1
they get into drugs and petty crime in their late teens or early 20s and often cut contacts with their families			2
some fall under the sway of radical preachers ; many become radicalized online			2
@entity0 had several encounters with law enforcement and on at least two occasions was charged with drug - related offenses			1
the picture emerging from those who knew him is that he was often on the move and given to irrational behavior			2
his family members said they had not seen him in five years			2
@entity0 had contact with a militant islamist in @entity101 , @entity102 , through social media			1
but @entity102 left for @entity104 early this year , and his influence over @entity0 is unclear			2
other lone wolves had troubled backgrounds , too days after the @entity110 shootings , another 32 - year - old , @entity108 , attacked four @entity112 police officers with a hatchet before being shot dead			1
a loner involuntarily discharged from the @entity115 11 years ago ( for issues with drugs , according to the @entity112 police ) , he was subsequently arrested six times			2
he converted to @entity18 two years ago and like many others appears to have been seduced by the online messaging of terrorist groups			1
@entity123 , who became known as the " shoe bomber " after he tried to blow up a trans - @entity126 flight in 2001 , was also a troubled young man -- impressionable , dabbling in minor crime and drugs and ending up in a young offenders ' detention center before converting to @entity18			1
once under the sway of militant imams at @entity135 mosques , his views quickly became more militant			1
the leader of the group that tried to detonate devices in @entity135 in 2005 , @entity139 , had moved to the @entity140 at age 14 from @entity142			2
he was in constant trouble at school before being convicted of a series of muggings , and estranged from his family			2
he went to the same young offenders ' center as @entity123 , where he found @entity18			1
after his release he too was influenced by radical preachers in @entity135 ( as was another in the group )			2
@entity0 and @entity123 were converts			2
like @entity139 , @entity156 was born a muslim ; he arrived in @entity158 from @entity27 as a child in the early 1980s			0
he suffered at the hands of a violent father and was prone to depression			0
as a young man @entity156 was a nightclub doorman in @entity164 's red - light district and no stranger to drugs and alcohol			0
but then in 2009 came an epiphany : he rediscovered his religion			0
whether he was influenced by others or self - radicalized is unclear , but his path to militancy was rapid and dramatic			0
@entity156 is now thought to be a leader within the @entity174 in @entity26 and @entity104 , or @entity30 , and has tried to get associates in @entity158 to carry out attacks , according to the federal police			0
@entity178 followed a similar path			0
a dj and rapper in @entity135 , @entity178 had lyrics that suggested redemption from drug use through religion			0
" it 's hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still i try to count my blessings and i thank @entity190 , " he wrote			0
@entity178 claimed he was also seared by the memory of his father 's arrest on terrorism charges			0
" i swear the day they came and took my dad , i could have killed a cop or two , " he rapped			0
like @entity156 , he also joined @entity30 , even tweeting a photograph of himself holding the severed head of one of the slain @entity24 hostages			0
investigators face challenges in identifying lone wolves so can more be done to identify individuals who may be drifting toward an act of terror but who have no connection with any group ? and what is the smartest combination of greater surveillance and tougher laws on the one hand -- and prevention and community outreach on the other ? de-radicalization programs , such as those in the @entity140 and @entity2 , have recognized the importance of identifying such individuals before they can do harm			1
the " channel " scheme in the @entity140 includes behavioral therapy , education and jobs training , and drug rehabilitation to help at - risk individuals , and frequently links them with role models			0
it has taken 4,000 referrals since its inception in 2007			0
@entity2 has developed a series describing real stories of radicalization that are used " to initiate conversations with community groups			0
" but as @entity248 acknowledges in its latest report " family members , peers , religious and community figures , teachers and medical and social service providers are crucial partners in recognizing and responding to the subtle indicators of radicalization			0
" even so , " early intervention through a joint community / law enforcement response is no guarantee that a person will not radicalize to violence , " @entity248 concluded			1
analysis of such de-radicalization programs is in its infancy ; the so - called lone wolves rarely appear on authorities ' radar			1
" the problem is the type of people who are ready to engage in these ( programs ) probably are n't the people that the government is most worried about , " criminologist @entity261 wrote in @entity262 last month			1
there is also argument about whether these programs should be aimed at de-radicalizing ( changing someone 's beliefs ) or more limited disengagement ( preventing them from carrying out violence			1
) @entity0 appears to have been enraged by the @entity2 and @entity278 governments ' refusal to grant him a passport			0
but three years ago , after being charged with robbery , he asked a court to send him to jail for a year to help him kick his addiction to crack cocaine			0
a psychiatrist said he was fit to face trial , but @entity0 was sentenced to just one day in jail			0
his addiction , anxiety and extreme religiosity became a toxic combination -- but the only intervention appears to have been the denial of a passport			0
@entity295 and outreach vs. detention , increased surveillance in some countries community leaders fear the balance is tipping more toward surveillance and tougher laws , to the neglect of prevention programs and community outreach			1
the @entity158 @entity307 is debating measures this week that would extend preventive detention and allow police to secretly search properties before notifying the target			0
@entity313 , director of the forum on @entity158 's @entity315 , told the @entity317 journal @entity318 recently : " the government has not made an effort to understand why young people have these ideas and thoughts			0
they 've created this invisible war and invisible threat that will continue forever			0
" the @entity140 government has abandoned most of the ambitious @entity329 program launched in 2005 to " increase the resilience of communities to violent extremism " -- the hearts and minds outreach ( after groups that were funded ended up being taken over by extremists ) and opted for a greater reliance on law enforcement			1
it is introducing tougher laws to confiscate the passports of those seen as " would - be " jihadists as well as to force terror suspects to join a de-radicalization program			1
@entity347 at the @entity348 for the @entity349 wrote in @entity350 last month that " the @entity140 has effectively given up trying to stop jihadists from being created			0
instead resources are being focused on trying to catch jihadists before they can strike			2
" to @entity347 , " this is an admission of a grave defeat			0
" but given resource - stretched governments -- scarred by the unpopularity of controversial outreach programs and struggling to keep tabs on " extremist travelers " to @entity104 and @entity26 -- are increasingly reaching for law enforcement tools to prevent terror coming to their cities , tracking the " lone wolves " is unlikely to get any easier .			1

like many " lone wolf " terrorists , @entity110 gunman was alienated drifter who converted to @entity18
conversion to militant @entity18 is often about seeking identity , purpose or adventure
some countries have tried " de-radicalization " programs to help prevent violence
but with resources stretched thin , the focus is often on increased law enforcement
