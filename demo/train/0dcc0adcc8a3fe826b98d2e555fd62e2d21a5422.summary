-- thanks to the circular firing squad nature of the 2012 @entity5 presidential primaries , it had begun to look as if president @entity7 would coast to re-election in november			1
but then came along high gas prices			2
the recent dramatic increase in gas prices could become the issue that slows the economy , stalls the recovery and sinks the president 's chances at a second term			1
as a @entity5 who recognizes president @entity7 's great skill as campaigner - in - chief , i 'm shocked he has handled the issue so poorly			1
even most of those who agree presidents ca n't do much to lower gas prices acknowledge they must be perceived as doing everything they can to ease the suffering			1
sixty - five percent of @entity30 tell pollsters they disapprove of the president 's handling of gas prices			1
average gas prices have reached $ 3.87 nationwide , the highest ever recorded in march			1
the prices are expected to go even higher as the summer driving season arrives			0
if president @entity7 ca n't change the perception that he ca n't do anything about it , he could find himself pumping his own gas after november			1
the international markets are unlikely to save him , given the current unrest in the @entity46 and rising demand in @entity48 , @entity49 and elsewhere			0
popular opinion -- and the @entity30 economy -- could take a strong turn against him if the situation is not rectified by summer			0
@entity30 will not appreciate paying $ 5 per gallon or more on their vacations			0
those in the battleground states of @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 could be particularly annoyed			0
they will come to see his energy policy -- calling oil " the fuel of the past , " and slowing the permit process for drilling in the @entity70 -- as crafted to please his friends in the green movement			1
and while the president is set to begrudgingly fast track the southern portion of the @entity79 pipeline , he does not appear to have bought into the merits of the entire project			0
president @entity7 can argue that changing his policies would not dramatically increase domestic oil supplies in the short run			1
while this is technically correct , @entity30 are unlikely to buy the argument			0
as economist @entity90 and others have noted , speculators and traders , whom president @entity7 has blamed for the current crisis , respond to news of new energy exploration			1
for example , president @entity94 confronted a similar problem with gas prices spiking during spring and summer 2008			1
he responded by lifting an executive branch moratorium on oil and gas exploration in the @entity101 regions in an effort to jump - start production , and high prices subsided by fall			2
president @entity7 seems to be leaning toward dipping into the @entity105 , which may or may not work since that move does not actually increase production			2
and he has embarked on an @entity30 energy tour , highlighted by stops in three swing states , to convince voters he 's doing all he can			2
the @entity5 candidates , who seem never to miss an opportunity to take on the president , must seize this moment to push for an energy policy that would better serve the interests of the middle class			1
they should start a conversation now on how to avoid future gas price spikes			2
domestic energy security is one of the nation 's most critical issues			2
president @entity7 's own @entity124 says we will need almost as much gasoline for transportation in 20 years as we consume today			1
the president is right that drilling alone will not satisfy our domestic needs			0
and he has supported an all - of - the - above approach			0
but his actions have n't completely matched his words			0
it truly must be all of the above			0
it must , as @entity135 contends , tap into proven homegrown reserves in the @entity138 , in @entity139 , off both coasts and in the @entity141			0
it must include an all - of - the - above approach to technology as well -- including fracking , mapping and drilling -- and it must again involve building refineries			0
such an approach can help drive down oil prices in the short term , boost domestic energy production , reduce dependence on unstable foreign sources , create jobs and provide new revenue streams for the government			0
it will be environmentally responsible because production of oil under @entity30 environmental standards is among the strictest in the world			0
president @entity7 has pinned almost his entire re-election hopes on an economic recovery			1
if gas prices do n't retreat soon , @entity30 will cancel their vacations , the seasonal industries that depend on those vacations will wilt , consumer spending will slow and the administration 's hopes of showing concrete signs of an economic recovery by @entity174 will fade			1
in that scenario , the president could find himself out of a job -- and it will be his own fault			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			0

average gas price has reached $ 3.87 nationwide -- the highest ever recorded in march

he says @entity5 candidates must seize the moment to push for a different energy policy
