-- yet another woman has come forward accusing comedian @entity2 of sexual assault			1
@entity4 filed a lawsuit in @entity6 , claiming sexual battery and infliction of emotional distress during an incident at the @entity11 , according to the documents first obtained by @entity13			1
the alleged sexual assault took place in 1974 when @entity4 was 15 years old			1
according to court documents , @entity4 and a 16 - year - old friend met @entity2 when he was filming a movie at @entity19 in @entity20			1
after talking with the girls , the suit alleges , @entity2 invited them to his tennis club the following saturday , " where he served them alcoholic beverages and played games of billiards			1
" they then went to the @entity11 where , the lawsuit says , @entity2 asked @entity4 to sit on a bed beside him , after she came out of a bathroom			1
" he then proceeded to sexually molest her by attempting to put his hand down her pants , and then taking her hand in his hand and performing a sex act on himself without her consent			0
" @entity0 reached out to @entity2 's lawyer @entity42 but was not immediately able to get a response			1
his camp has repeatedly and vigorously denied previous allegations			1
@entity0 also tried to contact @entity4 and her attorneys but has not heard back from them			0
@entity2 facing litany of allegations ' horrible , horrendous allegations ' the suit goes on to call @entity2 's alleged actions " malicious , oppressive and fraudulent in nature			1
" " this traumatic incident , at such a tender age , has caused psychological damage and mental anguish for ( @entity59 ) that has caused her significant problems throughout her life since the incident			0
" the case describes the damage as " substantial and continuing			0
" @entity4 is asking for damages and legal fees			0
because four decades have passed since the alleged crime , it was n't immediately clear if the case falls within the statute of limitations in @entity74 for child sex abuse			2
it 's because of that lag in time that defense attorney @entity78 says he thinks @entity2 's legal team will ask for the lawsuit to be dismissed			1
" it 's highly problematic , and it 's likely the lawsuit will not stand , " he said			2
with the allegations mounting , @entity0 political contributor @entity85 said , now is the time for @entity2 to speak up			2
" at some point , his silence becomes almost kind of an admission , " he said			0
" these are horrible , horrendous allegations			0
" @entity2 has not commented on the allegations , leaving that to his lawyer			2
in a recent statement , @entity42 said it defies common sense that " so many people would have said nothing , done nothing , and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years			2
" by @entity0 's count , at least 18 women have gone public with accusations			2
" he owes this country			0
he owes the women some kind of statement , " said @entity85 , who is also an attorney			0
" i think this level of silence for this long is unfair to everybody			0
" another allegation the lawsuit dropped on the same day @entity121 published a story in which a man named @entity124 alleges he rescued a female friend from @entity2 's @entity127 brownstone in 1984			1
the article describes @entity124 beating on the comedian 's front door after receiving a frantic phone call from the woman , who said , " @entity124 , you 've got to come get me			2
" after @entity2 answered the door , the story says , @entity124 found his friend on the second floor of the home			1
" she looked drugged and in a fog , and she could n't snap out of it , " he said			0
" she was a mess			0
" the @entity121 reports this same woman was a witness in a sex assault lawsuit against @entity2 , filed in 2005			1
that case was settled before going to trial			0
but @entity2 does have his supporters			2
comedian @entity148 said on november 17 that she was skeptical of the rape claims against him by one of the accusers			0
" i have a lot of questions for the lady , " @entity148 said on " @entity152			0
" her support may have prompted tuesday 's cryptic tweet from @entity2 's @entity159 account : " thank you @ @entity161			1

@entity2 's camp has *consistently* , *vehemently* denied the claims against him
