-- @entity1 and friends of a well - known literary translator in @entity4 are concerned for his well - being after he was detained for unknown reasons nearly two weeks ago			1
@entity7 , 39 , has been held since january 10 , according to a source close to his family			1
the family does n't know where he 's being detained or why he 's being questioned , but they fear he is in solitary confinement at @entity15 's notorious @entity14 , according to the source			1
the prison is known for its harsh conditions			1
@entity7 's family is " so worried about his health , " said the source , who did not want to be named for safety reasons			1
" he 's not a strong person physically			2
" his ordeal began in late november when he was questioned by security and intelligence officers			2
friends and family are n't sure the motive behind that questioning as phones are monitored in @entity4 and @entity7 was tight - lipped about the experience , which resulted in him being banned from leaving the country , according to the source			1
on january 10 , officials called him to the @entity39 , where he reported that morning			1
the court hears cases of smuggling , blaspheming , inciting violence or trying to overthrow the @entity46 government			1
after arriving at court , he was accompanied by security guards to the home he shares with his parents in @entity51 , outside @entity15			2
the guards searched the house , seizing electronic devices and documents , and prohibited @entity7 from speaking to his parents , the source said			2
his whereabouts have been unknown since the guards left the home with @entity7 in their custody			1
@entity62 , an @entity46 - @entity63 author whose best - selling book " @entity66 " @entity7 translated for the @entity46 audience , described her friend as " a very gentle soul			1
" " he 's a very innocent , very delicate man , " @entity69 said , adding , " i do n't think he would physically survive " the harsh conditions of prison			1
the source close to the family offered a similar description : " he 's a gentle , polite person , " comparing his manner of speaking to " how poets and writers talk			2
" both @entity69 and the source were adamant in describing @entity7 as someone who is not involved in @entity4 's politics , making the reason for his detainment even more of a puzzle			2
" he made a point of distancing himself from politics , " @entity69 said			0
@entity7 's mother has gone to court daily to arrange a supervised meeting with her son , the source said , but each day she is told that he is still being interrogated			0
the family has tried to obtain a lawyer for @entity7 , but they 've been advised that until he has been formally charged , they can not take up his case , according to the source			2
in addition to his translating work , @entity7 also runs a social media network in @entity4 called @entity103 , similar to @entity104			0
the site has 60,000 members			0
" he 's basically somebody who likes to connect artists and he 's never made any money -- he 's somebody who is in it for the higher good , " @entity69 said			0
" he 's always pursued things that have really benefited the people of @entity4			0
" @entity7 's case is just one of thousands circulating through @entity4 's justice system -- many as a result of religious or political persecution			0
but unlike the recent high - profile cases of @entity63 hikers detained for more than two years or a former @entity124 sentenced to death for espionage , many of those detainees ' stories are never made public			1
@entity4 's notoriously secretive trials have been assailed by human rights groups and governments around the globe			0
the @entity132 's annual human rights report on @entity4 says the court system is , in practice , " corrupt and subject to political influence			0
" and while the country 's constitution provides a defendant the right to a public trial , presumption of innocence , and a lawyer of his or her choice , " these rights were not respected in practice			0
" for his family and friends , the lack of information is gut - wrenching			1
" a man is in jail for no reason whatsoever and no one has heard from him , " @entity69 said , her voice breaking			0
" it 's a nightmare			0
this is this man 's life and i think about his parents and i got physically sick when i heard the news			0
" @entity0 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
