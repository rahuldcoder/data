everybody in the world will be on the internet within seven years			1
that 's what @entity5 executive chairman @entity4 said this weekend in public comments that inspired everything from excitement to incredulity			1
" for every person online , there are two who are not , " @entity4 wrote saturday on his @entity12 account			2
" by the end of the decade , everyone on @entity17 will be connected			0
" he followed up with a related thought on sunday			0
" think about how great the internet is with @entity23 users			2
now think about how amazing it will be when @entity25 come online in a decade			2
" it 's just the sort of big thinking that has led @entity5 to become one of the largest and most innovative tech companies in the world			1
but some of @entity4 's own followers took exception			1
" you really believe that ? what about the millions in @entity38 who ca n't even get enough food to eat or the natives in @entity42 who have no idea what technology is ? " a @entity12 user going by the name " @entity47 " wrote			0
" maybe you should rephrase to those in civilized areas or something like that ... " about 38 % of the world 's population uses the internet in 2013 , up from about 35 % last year , according to the @entity55 , a @entity56 agency dedicated to information and communication technology			1
with poor and developing nations around the world isolated by crumbling or nonexistent web infrastructures , and others hindered by factors ranging from remote geography to government censorship , is @entity4 's vision overly optimistic ? maybe			1
but do n't rule it out			0
as @entity70 's @entity69 notes , there are some projects under way to bring everyone the advantages of the digital age			0
@entity5 itself supports a project called @entity78 , a nonprofit group that donates computers and related technology to poor areas around the world			1
focusing largely on @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity38 , the decade - old group now aims to bring wireless access to regions with no traditional web access			0
@entity89 also is backing a project to turn old shipping containers into solar - powered , web - enabled classrooms in places like @entity38 and @entity94			0
the rise of the mobile web is also sure to play a role			0
in @entity38 , more people have access to a mobile phone than have access to electricity			0
in @entity38 , for instance , @entity5 says , 25 % of its searches during the week are via mobile devices , rising to 65 % on the weekends			2
what do you think ? is @entity4 's vision farfetched ? or could it happen ? let us know your thoughts in the comments			1

@entity5 chairman predicts the whole world will be on the web by 2020
@entity4 says @entity120 will be " amazing " with 5 billion users
only about a third of the world 's people are on the internet now
some remain *skeptical* it can be done in seven years
