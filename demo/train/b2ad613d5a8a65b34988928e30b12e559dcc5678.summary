-- if @entity2 was trying to make amends with his public mea culpa , he did n't seem to make any friends			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity0 's @entity9 , the embattled @entity7 owner apologized profusely for his comments about african - americans but insisted he is not a racist			2
that assertion was to be expected			0
but a plethora of other claims seem to contradict what others have said			0
@entity18 : " am i entitled to one mistake , am i , after 35 years ? " @entity2 told @entity9 he 's not a racist , just someone who made a " terrible , terrible mistake			1
" he was referring to the recorded conversation released last month , in which he told friend @entity24 that she should stop bringing black people to his games			2
" in your lousy f * * * ing @entity30 , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , " he said , according to the audio posted by @entity28			1
in his interview with @entity0 , @entity2 said his off - the - cuff remarks stemmed from jealousy , not racism			1
" when she said to me , i 'm going to bring four gorgeous black guys to the game ... i was a little jealous , " he said			2
" am i entitled to one mistake ? it 's a terrible mistake , and i 'll never do it again			0
" @entity43 : i 'm here to apologize and to ask for forgiveness reality : @entity2 has been accused of more than just one " mistake			1
" based on @entity2 's track record with his real estate ventures , the business mogul has made more than one mistake based on discrimination , attorney @entity48 said			1
" it was n't one mistake			2
this is not an isolated incident , " @entity48 told @entity0 's @entity55 on monday night			0
@entity48 is representing a woman who organized plaintiffs in a suit against @entity43			0
@entity2 was sued by the @entity61 in 2006 on allegations that his rental company refused to lease apartments to african - americans in @entity66 and refused to rent to non-koreans in the @entity69 section of @entity70			1
that case was settled in 2009			0
@entity2 agreed to pay nearly $ 3 million but continuing denying the accusations			1
and in 2003 , the nonprofit @entity73 and a group of tenants who lived in @entity2 's properties sued , accusing him of " numerous discriminatory statements and housing practices , " according to court documents			1
@entity2 " vehemently denied " the allegations and accused the plaintiffs of " being unreliable tenants and for being driven by hidden agendas , " according to court documents			1
the case was dismissed in 2005 after a settlement was reached			0
details of the deal were not disclosed			0
@entity2 to @entity9 : you 're more of a racist than i am --- --- @entity18 : " i was baited			1
i mean , that 's not the way i talk			0
" @entity2 said he was actually echoing words that @entity24 had used before the recording			1
" she would always use the word black , that 's a black girl , that 's a black guy , this is black that 's black , " @entity2 said			1
he also said @entity24 's alleged comment about bringing " four gorgeous black guys " to a game came just before the publicized part of the recorded conversation			2
" it was like she was baiting me just to say things , " @entity2 told @entity9			1
" when i listen to that tape , i do n't even know how i can say words like that			2
" reality : @entity24 blames his age			0
@entity24 , who is part black , said she does n't think the 80 - year - old @entity2 is a racist			1
" no , i do n't believe that in my heart , " she told @entity118 's @entity117			2
" i think the things he says are not what he feels			0
anyone can say anything in the heat of the moment			0
" i think he comes from a different generation ... he was brought up to believe these things ... segregation , whites and blacks , " @entity24 added			0
" but through his actions , he 's shown that he 's not a racist			0
he 's shown to be a very generous and kind man			0
" ex-nba player : " baited " comment is a joke --- --- @entity18 : " the players do n't hate me			2
the sponsors do n't hate me			2
" in fact , @entity2 said , people have been calling him " by the thousands " to offer their support			1
reality : the players have protested , and sponsors have left in droves			0
at the first @entity7 game after the @entity2 controversy broke , players wore their red warm - up shirts inside - out and concealed the @entity7 name			1
and sponsors such as @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 have pulled advertising from the @entity7 after the recorded conversation was released			0
--- --- @entity18 : " because the media says that the ( other @entity164 ) owners want me out does n't mean that they want me out			2

" reality : he did n't ask the owners if they want him out			2
@entity2 said he has received the support of some other franchise owners			1
but he later said he did n't ask specifically about whether they wanted him to retain ownership of the @entity7			2
it 's unclear whether the @entity164 can legally oust @entity2 , @entity0 legal analyst @entity171 said			1
but commissioner @entity173 has placed the onus on the owners ; they have the burden of deciding whether to oust one of their own			0
yet even if the owners are privately sympathetic to @entity2 , " an owner who dares to defend the embattled @entity7 owner commits social seppuku , " @entity171 said			1
on the other hand , @entity164 owners are independent thinkers and independently wealthy , he said			0
if anyone can weather criticism , it 's these captains of industry			0
--- --- @entity18 : @entity190 " does n't do anything " for @entity191			1
in perhaps the most bizarre part of his interview , @entity2 lambasted the retired @entity195 legend , who was mentioned several times in @entity2 's recorded exchange with @entity24			1
" what kind of a guy goes to every city , has sex with every girl , then he catches @entity203 ? is that someone we want to respect and tell our kids about ? " @entity2 asked			1
" i think he should be ashamed of himself			0
i think he should go into the background			0
but what does he do for the black people ? he does n't do anything			1
" reality : @entity190 has made plenty of impact off the court			2
