-- the first book i read by myself was @entity4 's " @entity3			1
" the illustrations were by @entity6			1
i was in my first grade classroom at @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10			1
i was sitting in an orange plastic chair			1
i was holding " @entity3			1
" i was studying the third story in the book , which is titled " @entity3 goes to @entity14 , " and i was staring at a picture of @entity3 , home - made space helmet atop his head , floating toward the moon			1
the words below the illustration said , " i 'm going to fly to the moon			1
" and somehow , suddenly , i was reading this sentence			2
and then i was reading the one below it , which said , " ' fly ! ' said @entity27			2
' you ca n't fly			2
' " a current of electricity shot through me			2
i was reading ! i was reading a book on my own ! those first words that i read by myself are intimately and forever bound to the art that appeared above them			1
it was as if the art were the doorway and it ushered me toward the words waiting on the other side			2
i entered the text through the art. it was one of the most powerful moments of my life			0
@entity6 sparked ' wild ' creativity in young readers when i heard @entity6 had died , i pulled my copy of " @entity3 " off the shelf and i turned to the third story in the book and i looked at that picture of @entity3 in his makeshift helmet headed to the moon and i felt again a zap of electricity			1
i flipped through the pages and came to a picture of @entity3 floating above a village			0
these words appear below the illustration : " @entity3 thought			0
i will jump from a good high spot , far up into the sky , and fly up , up , up			0
" and that is when i started to cry			0
i did n't know @entity6			1
i met him once , briefly			0
but i feel a terrible loneliness when i think about him not being in the world			0
his work has been that " good high spot " from which to jump			0
it was the good high spot when i was 7			0
and it is the good high spot , now , some 40 years later			0
@entity6 's art was my portal to reading , to storytelling , to magic , to the world			1
i look at that picture of @entity3 floating above the village and all i can think is , " wait , do n't go			0
i wanted to tell you a story			0
