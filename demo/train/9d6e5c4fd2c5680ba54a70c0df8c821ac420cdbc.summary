@entity0 , @entity1 -- millions of @entity3 poured into the streets saturday to celebrate the victory of presidential candidate @entity6			1
huge crowds snarled traffic in the capital , @entity10 , demanding the release of hundreds of political prisoners arrested during protests over sham elections four years ago			2
" my dead brother and sister , i got your vote back , " people chanted , a reference to more than 100 demonstrators killed by the regime			0
the surprise was not so much that 18 million votes were cast for @entity6 , slightly more than half the ballots , but the fact that the regime had endorsed his victory , triggering hope that international pressure over @entity3 's nuclear program and growing internal rifts at home might have forced the leadership to restore some of its lost legitimacy			1
@entity6 is not a reformist , even according to @entity3 standards			1
he had backed the violent crackdown against the pro-democracy student movement in 1999 and never formally aligned himself with the reformist camp			0
a cleric and a veteran politician since 1979 , he was in the circle close to the founder of the revolution , @entity45			2
he served five terms as a member of @entity49 and 16 years as the head of the @entity51			0
during the campaign , he presented himself as a moderate , a platform that appeals to @entity3 's young electorate , and called for drawing @entity3 out of its international isolation			1
" it is important for the centrifuges to spin , but people 's lives should run too , " he said in a televised address , referring to uranium enrichment			1
he gained momentum only a few days before the election when two former presidents , both aligned with the reformers , @entity64 and @entity65 , threw their support behind him			2
then voters decided to give the polls , as a window to exercise their democratic rights , another try			0
ironically , @entity6 , the only cleric among the eight candidates , favors more political and social freedoms at home			1
during one of his talks , his supporters chanted slogans demanding the release of opposition leaders , @entity83 and @entity84 , the two presidential candidates in 2009 who have been under house arrest for two years			0
opinion : will @entity6 alter @entity3 's policy on @entity89 ? the @entity91 ayatollah @entity90 , along with his military loyalists , the @entity93 and its militia wing @entity94 -- the alliance that many believe stole the election in favor of the incumbent @entity99 -- still remain in ultimate power			1
many had suspected that the regime would go to extraordinary lengths , as it did in 2009 , to manage the vote from start to finish			0
the guards and the @entity94 campaigned vigorously for @entity108 , a @entity90 loyalist and @entity3 's hard - line nuclear negotiator			2
his loss with less than 15 % of the vote was an embarrassing rebuke of @entity90 's policies			0
last month , demonstrators chanted " death to @entity116 , " meaning @entity90 , at the funeral of a dissident cleric in the city of @entity120			0
so by giving in to @entity6 's victory , many believe @entity90 is trying fix his tattered image			1
@entity6 is @entity3 's next president although the election was far from democratic , it provided an opportunity for many @entity3 , especially the young , to break the deadly atmosphere of fear the government has imposed for the past four years			1
the watchdog @entity131 had already helped @entity90 sideline his rivals , barring a prominent politician and a former president , @entity65 , from running in the race			0
government forces arrested activists and campaigners in the months before the election			0
economic issues were paramount on the minds of voters as @entity143 - led sanctions have reduced @entity3 's oil revenue by half and shot the inflation rate up to more than 30 %			2
voters recalled @entity6 as the county 's pragmatist nuclear envoy who deterred threats in 2003 by signing the @entity151 , allowing inspectors from the @entity153 to visit @entity3 's nuclear facilities			1
further , @entity3 suspended its sensitive uranium enrichment activities , a process that can be used to make nuclear fuel or a nuclear bomb if uranium is enriched to high levels			2
those measures built trust around @entity3 's nuclear program until @entity99 reversed them in 2005			0
it is not clear if @entity90 's hard - line allies will allow @entity6 to introduce real change			1
the president sets the tone for domestic and foreign policy and can make room for more moderate voices in politics			0
but he holds little power compared with the authority that the constitution gives @entity90			0
if @entity90 is willing to end international pressure over @entity3 's nuclear program , @entity6 provides the perfect opportunity			1
@entity6 's victory has already bolstered a sense of optimism			1
@entity3 currency , the rial , strengthened slightly against the @entity143 dollar for the first time on saturday after its steady downward spiral since 2011			0
in his first message after his election , @entity6 declared that " a new chapter " has begun and hoped the international community would use a more respectful rhetoric toward @entity3			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity193 .			2

@entity193 : half the votes were for @entity6 , but government 's support is surprising
@entity199 : he supports enrichment of uranium : " it is important for the centrifuges to spin "
@entity6 was the only cleric to run , she says , but he favors political and social freedoms
@entity199 : @entity208 sparked optimism , hopes for respect from international community
