@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is too young to fully grasp the significance of her life : that she is a last in a country of 1.2 billion people			1
she has become the greatest symbol of @entity1 's valiant -- and successful -- effort to rid itself of a crippling and potentially deadly disease			1
@entity3 , 4 , is the final documented case of polio in @entity1			1
her face has appeared in newspapers and on television			0
she 's been invited to national events by @entity17 , the organization that led the effort to rid @entity1 of polio			1
she is a literal poster child , an inspiration , a symbol of a feat that no doctor or health official thought possible even a few years ago			1
but on thursday , the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) officially certified @entity1 as being polio - free			1
apart from the publicity , though , @entity3 's life has hardly changed , her future still a question mark			1
she is used to seeing health officials and reporters arrive on foot at her home in @entity34 , a village in the @entity1 state of @entity36			1
on the day we visited , she dressed herself in a long green printed dress , marred only by a tear at the shoulder			0
she oiled her hair and pulled it back with plastic barrettes			0
she did it all herself when she learned we were on our way			0
her parents , @entity46 , 32 , and @entity47 , 30 , blame themselves for their child 's suffering			2
they had their other children vaccinated , but not @entity3			1
she was a sickly child , in and out of hospital with liver infections and diarrhea			0
they thought it safer not to subject her to more medication			0
it was n't until little @entity3 's right foot swelled and twisted in early 2011 that her parents took her to a hospital in nearby @entity61 for tests			1
she was just 18 months old when doctors confirmed the worst : @entity3 had polio			1
polio is caused by a virus that attacks the brain and spinal cord cells that move joints and muscles			2
about one - third of those who contract polio in @entity1 are left paralyzed -- as was @entity3			1
" everything was our fault , " explains her father			0
" i thought she would never walk again			0
" ' hell of a big deal ' when a global effort to end polio was launched in 1988 , the disease crippled more than 200,000 children every year in @entity1			1
almost two decades later , in 2009 , @entity1 still reported half of the world 's new cases -- 741 out of 1,604			1
@entity1 has millions of poor and uneducated people			1
large areas lack hygiene and good sanitation , and polio spreads through contaminated water			2
many health experts predicted @entity1 would be the last country in the world to get rid of polio			1
since @entity3 's diagnosis three years ago , @entity1 has not seen another new case of polio			1
with the eradication of polio in @entity1 , @entity25 formally proclaimed another one of its global regions -- @entity102 -- free of the disease			1
@entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 are the only three countries that have not eradicated polio , leaving the @entity109 and @entity110 the last two @entity25 regions with the disease			1
the last time who made a similar announcement was in 2002 , when the @entity116 region was declared polio - free			1
@entity17 says the declaration is a milestone for a nation that was once the epicenter of the disease			1
@entity1 's journey from 200,000 to zero has not been easy , says @entity123 , a businessman who heads @entity17 's polio campaign in @entity1			1
" it 's a tremendous achievement , " he says			2
" @entity1 is a hell of a big deal			1
" @entity123 has been at the helm of @entity1 's campaign since 2001			1
when he started , he was told @entity1 was holding the world hostage , that the planet could not be polio - free until its second most populous nation had eliminated the disease			1
the western part of @entity136 state was the worst , @entity123 says			0
at one time , scientists documented that the single worst pocket of polio , the city of @entity141 , had exported the virus to every continent			2
now , @entity123 says , the three remaining nations where polio still exists can learn from @entity1			1
three keys to success western nations conquered polio so long ago that its name is unknown to younger generations			1
@entity153 experienced the height of polio in the 1940s and ' 50s , when about 35,000 people became disabled every year			2
fear and panic spread and parents were known to warn their children to not drink from public water fountains , avoid swimming pools and stay away from crowded public places like movie theaters			0
perhaps the most famous case of polio in @entity153 was @entity168 , the first president with a significant physical disability			1
the development of the @entity172 and @entity173 vaccines helped lead to eradication of polio in the @entity153 in 1979			2
in @entity1 , too , vaccination was critical			2
" there were three keys to our success , " @entity123 says			0
" immunize , immunize and immunize			0
" but the challenges in @entity1 went way beyond getting 170 million children vaccinated each year and needing 2 million health workers on the case			1
they went beyond securing $ 2.3 billion in government funding			0
the oral vaccine must be kept cold , and many places in @entity1 do not have electricity -- and even those that do experience frequent power cuts			2
each vaccine costs only 12 cents , but refrigerating them was a major problem , says dr. @entity195 , an orthopedic surgeon who runs @entity1 's last dedicated polio ward at @entity197 in @entity198			1
@entity1 was able to come up with innovative ideas -- like refrigerators powered by kerosene -- to get vaccinations to remote villages not unlike the one where @entity3 lives			1
and then there was the campaign to educate			0
rumors had spread in @entity208 communities about the polio vaccine			2
some @entity208 believed it made women infertile and that the @entity1 government was using it to curb a minority population			2
to combat such false beliefs , health workers began a dialog with clerics			0
they were able to build trust and persuade the clerics to put drops of the vaccine in their own grandchildren 's mouths so their followers could see nothing bad would happen			2
for @entity195 , all this means that the makeup of his polio ward has changed			2
the patients tend to be older now since there have been no new cases reported since 2011			2
@entity195 has operated on thousands of twisted and mangled bodies , on patients who are forced to crawl on all fours			0
@entity236 , he says , robs a person of dignity			0
" it 's terrible to have a childhood ruined , " he says , inspecting the progress of @entity240			0
she 's lived with polio 23 of her 25 years			1
she used to press her hand to her thigh when she walked , to keep her left leg down			0
her left foot used to point outwards			0
in her dreams she walked upright			0
in her dreams , she danced , even wore pants , something she was not able to do before because of the way her limbs were bent			0
@entity195 straightened her leg with his orthopedic surgical skills			0
" i 'll be able to walk straight , " she says , laughing , " just like you			0
" @entity195 moves on to the other polio patients occupying the 16 beds reserved for them at the missionary - run hospital			2
some had knees that had twisted upward to their hips			0
others could not even stand			0
when they leave here , they will embark on lives that were previously unimaginable			0
" i would be happy to go out of business -- this kind of business , " he says , though he knows he will be seeing polio patients until the day he retires			0
half of @entity1 's 21 million physically disabled people are that way because of polio			1
@entity195 has never met @entity3			2
but he is relieved to know she is the last			0
poster child in @entity34 , @entity3 plays with her brothers and sisters and other children on the bone - dry earth , the dirt forming clouds beneath their feet			1
the effects of polio were not severe as they could have been , and after exhaustive therapy , @entity3 is able to use her legs			1
she is not unlike the other barefoot children in this village of palms and ponds except that she has a limp			0
her right leg is shorter than her left , a condition that is common with polio patients			0
she complains that her right foot hurts when she runs and jumps			0
learning from their own mistake , @entity3 's parents have become advocates for polio vaccinations in their part of the world			1
@entity46 is thankful his daughter was not left immobile , but still , he worries for her future			0
he is a poor man , and like most men and women in this village , he makes about $ 40 a month embroidering saris -- far less than the brocaded and beaded garments sell for			0
he knows he must save money for future health care needs and do all he can to make sure @entity3 is educated			2
he is certain he will face obstacles in finding a groom for a daughter with a disability			0
@entity153 , too , had poster children for polio at a time when the country was racing to stamp out the disease			2
in the 1950s , two girls in matching gingham jumpers appeared in an anti-polio campaign			0
@entity325 was shown loosening her sister @entity327 's leg brace			0
they were faces , just like @entity3 , of a disease that now is on the brink of global eradication			1
there is no cure for polio , but the two @entity153 sisters were able to overcome the crippling nature of the disease			2
now it 's @entity3 's turn to lead a full life			1
without the interference of polio			0
follow @entity342 on @entity343 .			0

@entity3 , 4 , is the last known case of polio in @entity1
she has become a symbol of her nation 's *remarkable* effort to eradicate the disease
just a few years ago , @entity1 reported half the world 's new cases
