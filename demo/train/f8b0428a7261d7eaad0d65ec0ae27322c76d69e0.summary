-- the morning started off as just another day			2
the alarm clock announced the start of the day at 4 a.m. , well before the sun would begin to peer over the eastern horizon			0
i had merely 75 minutes to get myself and two young boys ready and out the door for what would soon become a roller - coaster of a day			2
i do n't have what everyone would consider a normal job			0
i 'm a soldier in the @entity12			1
currently , i serve as the public affairs chief for the 4th @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			0
my job is one of the greatest in the armed forces , because i have a unique opportunity to focus my efforts in telling the stories of the many heroes and patriots who serve in our military ranks			0
the mechanics , truck drivers , personnel specialists , etc. , are some of the unsung heroes in our formation , and it 's my goal to highlight their achievements			2
but on this day , after i dropped my boys off at day care and arrived at the first formation of the morning to salute the flag at @entity40 , the tables were turned			2
i was called in front of all my peers , recognized for my hard work and awarded an opportunity to attend the @entity45 at @entity46 in @entity47 the following day			2
watch staff sgt. @entity48 take to the track this was an incredible honor to be recognized by my leadership as they recommended me for this opportunity			1
i am humbled that they would think so highly of my performance at work ; however , i feel it is more of a privilege to be in a position to meet so many other soldiers who have volunteered to serve our great nation			0
however , for me , it 's my job when i 'm not in the office that is much more important : i 'm a single parent to two very special boys			1
my oldest son , @entity67 , 6 , has cerebral palsy as a result of a heart arrhythmia , stroke and seizures when he was just 3 months old			0
his brother , @entity73 , 5 , is about two years developmentally delayed and borderline autistic			0
having two children with special needs added to my appreciation for the experience at the @entity79 , as all the proceeds benefited the @entity81			1
seeing someone in the position of @entity84 , the defending @entity85 champion , donate his time to help raise money for less fortunate children was simply amazing			1
this was the fifth time @entity84 has hosted his @entity79 at @entity46 , and in only five years , he has raised more than $ 1 million for @entity81			1
not only does it speak volumes to the character of @entity84 as an individual , it goes to the generosity of people in the @entity98 / @entity47 area who donated that money for the charities			1
as a single parent of two exceptional children , i understand the importance of a helping hand once in a while			1
on the day of the @entity105 , i was able to drive a stock car around the track for a pair of 10 - lap sessions as well as a three - lap heat session as a passenger with @entity84 driving			1
i 'm a long - time @entity85 fan , so it had always been a dream of mine to get a car up to full speed on the high banks			0
the experience was certainly a once in a lifetime opportunity that i will always be grateful for and an opportunity that i hope will be afforded to other outstanding soldiers in the years to come			0
i am but one man serving as part of a much larger team of volunteer soldiers who have dedicated their life to serve the @entity127			0
some may look at my circumstances with being a single military father of two special needs children as a difficult and challenging hardship ; those individuals could n't be more incorrect			1
i am truly blessed for everything that i have been given			0
i have an extraordinary opportunity to be a strong role model for the two most resilient and strong boys a father could ask for .			2

staff sgt. @entity48 was awarded a trip to @entity84 's racing camp
all the proceeds from the camp benefit the @entity146 's charities
@entity48 has two boys with special needs and serves in the @entity12
@entity48 : as a single parent , i understand the importance of a helping hand
