-- @entity1 is a veritable repository of the unique , the one - off and the rare			1
this southern @entity4 city is home to the world 's largest lemon ( the 10 - foot - long fiberglass behemoth sits in @entity9 , a small town in metro @entity1 ) and also boasts the world 's largest collection of memorabilia from the late dr. @entity13 , who was a longtime resident of the city 's @entity15 community			1
and two products that could n't be more different , the ubiquitous @entity20 lubricant and dr. @entity22 's soaps , both have roots here			2
check out five more quirky things unique to @entity1 : a civic organist who gives free weekly outdoor concerts a public uproar broke out in 2011 when local leaders threatened to cut the city 's staff organist , a position that 's been on the payroll for nearly a century			1
every sunday afternoon since the organ was donated by sugar heirs @entity37 and @entity38 in 1914 , a staff organist has stepped up to the keys of a 50 - ton pipe organ at a pavilion in @entity42			1
fortunately for organ fans , tradition prevailed and the organist 's contract was renewed for another 10 years			1
fans of current organist @entity48 , a @entity49 who once played for princess @entity50 , line up to buy cds after the 2 p.m. performances			1
" i 'm doing everything i can to dispel the organ 's dowdy image , " she says			2
for years , the @entity56 boasted that its namesake instrument was the largest outdoor organ in the world			2
but then the benefactor of an organ in @entity62 e-mailed to inform them that their claim had been topped			2
in honor of the @entity69 's upcoming 100 - year - anniversary , supporters have started a capital campaign to add another 500 pipes			1
take that , @entity62 pipe organ			2
a presidential museum , housed in a high school @entity77 social studies teacher @entity76 began collecting presidential memorabilia in 1996 to spice up his @entity80 history lessons			2
with the help of his students , @entity76 started the @entity83 that now has more than 40,000 items representing all 44 presidents			0
among the 2,000 items on display in the school 's library annex are @entity91 's golf shoes , a @entity93 shower head , a life - size cardboard cutout of @entity95 and a 1980s " @entity97 book " of @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 complete with clothes , accessories and furnishings			1
there 's more to see in a locked conference room that 's also open to the public when not being used for , say , a math department staff meeting			0
over the years , @entity76 's students have written to collectors , reaping such donations as an original 1844 @entity113 drawing of all 11 presidents to that point and a portrait of @entity117 drawn in one continuous line			0
also gifted to the museum was a miniature @entity121 campaign license plate sent back to the factory after the president was shot in 1963 ; the collection also features the @entity126 464 @entity4 plate that replaced it			0
a display case of @entity130 paraphernalia valued at more than $ 10,000 features more items than are on view at his birthplace home in @entity136 , @entity137			0
count the @entity139 movie sets from the film " @entity141 " among the treasures that got away			0
@entity143 offered to donate the sets , but then reneged when @entity145 needed them for " @entity147			0
" @entity76 says only about 500 nonstudents see the unique museum each year			0
sand dunes with secret messages it did n't take @entity153 to decipher the code in the sand dunes on @entity156			0
you 'd never know the maze - like dunes just north of the @entity159 spell anything if you 're simply playing beach volleyball or building a sand castle , but @entity164 jets flying overhead ca n't miss the pickleweed - covered dunes shaped into the letters @entity169 - @entity168 - a - @entity167 city maintenance employee @entity171 created the " sand sculpture " in 1988 from tons of seaweed washed ashore after a big storm			1
using heavy equipment and quick thinking ( where else are you going to dispose of five tons of seaweed ? ) @entity171 meticulously spelled out the beach 's name and covered the seaweed in sand			0
a comedian in a chicken suit turned folk hero @entity185 , the man behind the famously irreverent @entity185 , was named by @entity186 as one of the @entity188 alongside @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193			1
@entity185 was a lowly student at @entity194 when he was hired by a radio station during spring break 1974 to pass out @entity199 eggs at the @entity200			0
the $ 2 - an - hour chicken - suit gig beat the pay he made as a dishwasher , and @entity185 , angling to score free admission to baseball games , talked his way into donning the costume again at @entity209 games			1
the slapstick antics of the costumed chicken became so popular that @entity213 sports writer @entity212 called him " the most gifted physical comic since @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218			1
" @entity185 ( as the chicken ) has gone on to star in movies ( " @entity225 " where he stomped the evil villains in a parking lot ) , commercials , tv shows and a recorded cover of @entity224 's " @entity230 ? " a surfboard museum in a taco joint @entity233 , a family - run taco shop on @entity235 , doubles as a museum of @entity4 surf culture			1
the museum / taco shop / vintage surf film production company was started in 1989 by @entity241 and his wife , @entity242			2
she 's the cook and evil genius behind the 15 spicy filling options that impelled @entity246 to add this nonchain to its list of the country 's top 10 burritos			0
he 's the collector of 90 plus surfboards , all on display at the popular surfer 's hangout			0
" i 've got boards from all the big names in surfing , " says @entity241 who , at 60 , still surfs any chance he can			0
" i have a @entity262 , a solid 10 - foot balsa wood board in beautiful shape			2
when the sun shines on it , it gives off a warm glow , like a fine guitar			0
i grew up in @entity270 , and my collection represents my lifetime -- from balsa to foam , from long to short , from heavy to light			0
" more than 50 vintage surf movies play on a continuous loop on two flat - screen tvs			1
and whenever it rains , @entity233 offers $ 1 off their to - die - for chicken tortilla soup			1
