@entity0 was only in his 20s			1
but something , his family and friends say , made him outline three things he wanted when he died : to repay his parents any debt he may have owed , to give a homeless person some money and to leave " an awesome tip " for a waiter or waitress			1
" i 'm not talking about 25 %			1
i mean $ 500 for a ... pizza , " @entity0 wrote in his will , according to his brother			1
@entity0 died on july 7 , just three weeks after his 30th birthday , in a @entity19 , @entity18 , hospital , leaving behind family and friends who took up his final request -- to leave a big tip. family and friends fulfilled @entity0 's request , tipping one waitress in @entity19 the $ 500 , a moment that @entity0 's brother , @entity29 , videotaped and posted online wednesday to @entity30			1
it is linked to the family 's memorial page , @entity34			2
maybe it was the simple gesture			0
maybe it was the generosity			0
but something caught the imagination of the public , who began watching the video			2
by saturday , according to a @entity30 count , there were more than 1.3 million views and nearly $ 30,000 in donations for the family to continue what has become known as " @entity48 , " @entity29 told @entity49			1
the nearly 3 - minute video chronicles the family carrying out @entity0 ' last wish at @entity54 's @entity53 , a pizzeria in @entity19			1
" well , this is where it 's happening , " @entity29 says , narrating the trip to the pizzeria on tuesday			0
" i 'm waiting for the rest of the family to get here and then we 'll be going in and having lunch and giving someone a big tip. hope it means a lot to them			1
" restaurant manager @entity70 told @entity49 the family came in and ordered from waitress @entity72			2
the video picks up at the end of the meal , with the brother telling the waitress : " my brother passed away late last week			0
he asked that we go have pizza , and leave the waiter or waitress a $ 500 tip. " tips on tipping from @entity83 a visibly stunned @entity84 said : " are you serious ? are you kidding me ? " @entity29 answered : " that 's what he wanted			1
yeah , and if people keep donating , we will keep giving away $ 500			1
" @entity84 then hugged him			0
" i 'm going to be telling this story the rest of my life , " she said			0
a preliminary investigation of @entity0 ' cause of death points to suicide by strangulation , according to the @entity101 coroner , though final autopsy results have yet to be released			2
@entity0 ' family question the initial findings , saying there was no indication he would take his own life , according to his brother			1
but family members have no doubt that @entity0 ' last wish is making a big impact			1
since the video posted on @entity30 , @entity29 said the family has heard from people in the @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and even @entity119			2
so many people responded that he is moving the website to a different server to handle the increased traffic			0
" people have just been overwhelmingly generous and kind , " he said			0
" if we can keep doing it , i 'd like to keep giving these tips , and keep filming them so other people can see the happiness it 's bringing to someone			0
" all the donations are going to the waiters and waitresses , the brother said			0
" he left us a will full of his personality , " @entity29 wrote on a memorial page			2
" @entity0 was generous in life , and that 's probably why he did n't have the money to do this himself			2
