-- i thought she was over			0
i thought she was too old to be referring to herself as a " girl			2
" i thought pop music passed her by			0
i thought @entity8 had killed her			1
and then i look at this week 's @entity11 chart and i see i thought wrong			1
her 12th cd , " @entity18 " debuted no. 1 on the album chart and she has two singles on the dance - chart @entity17			1
she 's 53 and the clubs are banging her new stuff , including " @entity21 , " which became her 38th top 10 hit on the pop chart			1
for those of you keeping score , that 's more than @entity29 , more than @entity30			0
i 'm not saying she 's better , but clearly she 's done -- correction -- doing more			0
this year she won another @entity32 and her halftime performance at the @entity34 drew more viewers than the game itself , according to @entity38			0
i know the perception is that only gay men care about @entity3 , but if that were true , given the 114 million viewers who tuned in to watch her at halftime , maybe " do n't ask , do n't tell " should have been called " just assume			1
" the reality is it 's hard for pop music to leave behind someone who keeps leading the pack			1
@entity3 had the highest grossing tour ever for a solo artist ( 2008 ) and has sold more than 300 million records worldwide			1
she 's an ' 80s child whose 2005 single " @entity57 " holds the @entity54 record for topping the charts in 41 countries , while 2012 's @entity18 was no. 1 on @entity59 in 40 countries			1
that 's not " over , " that 's now			0
when you look at where @entity3 's career is today in the same week we learned @entity67 drowned in a foot of water , you 're reminded that @entity70 truly does work in mysterious ways			1
the two pop icons released debut albums within two years of each other , @entity3 in 1983 and @entity76 in 1985			1
of course , @entity76 was the former model with a voice for the ages , while @entity3 was the thin - voiced tart rolling around on the floor of the @entity83 music awards in a wedding dress proclaiming that she felt like a virgin			1
if anyone might have been expected to meet a desperate , tragic end , back then the safe money would have been on @entity3			1
and yet @entity76 's gone , @entity90 's gone , @entity89 is semi-retired and everyone else , with the exception of @entity93 , is making their money off nostalgia			1
meanwhile , @entity3 has methodically become , arguably , the greatest recording artist of all time			2
who would 've thunk it ? as for the music , her latest cd is not breaking any new ground , but it does remind everyone who owns the ground @entity8 , @entity101 , @entity102 and others are walking on			1
in fact , each time they receive a royalty check , they should be sending @entity3 a cut			2
while @entity18 is about three songs too long for my taste , i will tell you the first five songs make it very difficult not to want to dance , and that the track " @entity120 " is pure genius			0
as you could probably figure out from the title , it 's not radio friendly , but likely not because of what you may think			0
and that , in a nutshell , is why @entity3 is who she is			2
you can tell you 're watching a @entity131 film with the first five minutes of dialogue			0
you can identify the beautiful prose of @entity134 within a couple of pages			0
but my 15 - year - old came home one day and asked who i was listening to			0
i told him @entity3 and my son , who loves techno and hip hop , thought i was joking			2
" seriously ... like your @entity3 ? " he asked			2
" yep , " i said			0
" well , she 's still old but that song 's not			0
" the song was " @entity120 " and i 'm glad he left the room before she started singing			0
as i said , it 's not radio friendly			0
but then again , it would n't be @entity3 if a song like that was			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			2

@entity153 says @entity3 topping @entity11 chart with new album ; she 's so not over
he says it 's hard to dismiss singer who , by most *measures* , still leads the pack at 53
he says fate of @entity76 puts *success* of @entity3 , a " *bad* girl , " in perspective
@entity169 : artists from @entity8 to @entity102 are walking on ground @entity3 broke
