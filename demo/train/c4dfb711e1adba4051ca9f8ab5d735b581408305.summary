-- those of us who have yet to lay hands or eyes on anything but images of @entity7 are prone to daydreaming about how we 'll actually interact with the device			0
we know there are buttons , a tiny touchpad , and voice inputs , but what about the times when we want to check our e-mail and do n't want to speak aloud to an inanimate object ? a @entity18 user who bore into the @entity7 code came out with an interesting discovery : the ability to trigger an event with a " wink " gesture			1
the code includes provisions for enabling and disabling winks as a command , as well as a couple of lines for calibration and one called " @entity32			1
" the need for calibration suggests that users will be able to set up the wink trigger to prevent @entity7 from registering a blink as a chance to fire off whatever action is attached to the gesture			1
while this sounds like a potentially useful feature , we ca n't help but picture enjoying ourselves in a public space when another person wearing @entity7 catches our eye			2
slowly , deliberately , they wink			0
@entity47 has apparently been working on a number of control and interaction schemes , including virtual buttons projected onto nearby surfaces ( hands , arms ) and audio playback designs that vibrate the bones in the user 's head to make themselves heard			0
explorer editions of the headsets are in developer hands now ( as well as those who submitted proposals ) , and the consumer versions are set to hit sometime next year			0

code for @entity47 's @entity7 *eyewear* suggests users may snap photos with a wink of an eye
@entity7 just *shipped* to beta users but wo n't be available to everyone until 2014
the code includes provisions for enabling and disabling winks as a command
