another $ 50 will add a cable tv package to the mix as well			0
all in all , $ 120 is in line with what you 'd expect to pay for similar tv - plus - internet service from other major cable providers			1
so why would someone in @entity2 want to make the switch ? the need for speed @entity7 is promising download and upload speeds of up to one gigabit per second , which it says is about 100 times faster than the average @entity28 broadband connection			1
remember back in june when @entity29 announced its @entity31 package , which offered theoretical download speeds of 300 megabits per second and theoretical upload speeds of 65 megabits per second ? that package costs $ 210 per month			0
@entity7 's theoretical download speed is more than three times as fast and its theoretical upload speed is more than 15 times as fast for a third of the price			1
if @entity9 ever gets out of @entity2 , other internet providers better watch out			2
if you sign up for both @entity42 and cable for two years , you 'll get the coolest remote control ever made : @entity7 's new @entity46 tablet			1
normally selling for $ 200 , it 's arguably the best @entity49 tablet on the market , equipped with an app that lets you control your tv and search for shows with a swipe of your finger			2
not only that , you 'll be able to watch tv on your tablet from any room in the house			0

@entity71 the standard dvrs from most cable providers do a decent job , but @entity7 has an added bonus for its customers : its storage box can record up to eight tv shows at one time and features two terabytes of storage			2
that 's a lot of episodes of @entity83 ( 500 hours worth , to be exact )			0
plus , if you ever get bored with what you 've recorded , you can stream @entity86 or @entity87 from the dvr			0
searching for stuff to watch on tv will include relevant streamable results , too , all in the same place			0
who needs hardware ? @entity7 is offering one terabyte of @entity97 storage for @entity42 subscribers and is heavily pushing its @entity99 for $ 299			2
this , my friends , is what this whole @entity9 thing is all about			0
as long as people have slow internet connections , relying solely on @entity7 's cloud is n't really an option			1
time.com : why @entity7 or @entity110 buying your favorite startup means it 's probably toast but if you have a one - gigabit - per - second connection ? all of a sudden using a @entity99 with @entity97 as your primary computer does n't sound so crazy			1
free internet even if you do n't want blazing download speeds and a cool tablet for a remote control , you can still get @entity9 's basic five - megabit service for $ 0 per month			1
time.com : @entity7 adds new 34 - button scientific calculator to search results granted , you 'll need to put down a $ 300 construction free , but after that your internet connection will be guaranteed free for the next seven years			2
