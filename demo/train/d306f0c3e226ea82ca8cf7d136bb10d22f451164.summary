-- an @entity2 soldier went on a house - to - house shooting spree in two villages in the @entity6 region of @entity7 early sunday , @entity7 officials said , killing 16 people			1
@entity11 's @entity10 said the soldier acted alone and turned himself in after opening fire on civilians			1
@entity2 president @entity14 called the killings " tragic and shocking			1
" what are people feeling in @entity7 , and how will this affect the @entity2 strategy moving forward ? @entity0 correspondent @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity7 , takes a look in this edited transcript			1
q : there were some reports suggesting that perhaps it was several soldiers			0
what can you tell us about that ? @entity32 : the @entity2 and @entity10 officials are sticking with the one - soldier story : that just one @entity36 staff sergeant left the base , went on a shooting rampage and then returned and turn himself in			1
they are still saying that on monday , that this was the work of one person , that there was no mission going on at the time in the area , that that person obviously has been detained , and a full investigation is under way			0
but i want to tell you a little bit about some really gruesome images that i 've just looked at , coming from one of the locals in the area who took a lot of photos and video of the villagers			1
perhaps the worst pictures are burned bodies , including a toddler who has what appears to be a bullet hole in the toddler 's head			2
there are images inside of one of these small homes of blood - covered floors and blood splattered on the walls			0
and we 're also talking about shell casings that are on the ground that are being picked up , obviously from investigators who have come in the next day			2
this apparently happened somewhere between 2 and 3 in the morning on sunday			2
since then , the villagers have been accusing the @entity2 government of not telling the truth , saying there were more @entity2 soldiers on the ground when this happened			1
but we did hear from a couple of people saying that all they know is that at least one of them did open fire			0
that person , as i said , has been detained			0
but gruesome images coming out of @entity95 district			0
this is an area known to have a strong @entity98 presence , an area , though , where villagers say , " look , we were told by the @entity2 to come back to this area , and look what has happened to us " -- a lot of sorrow , a lost people crying and trying to explain what happened through tears there in @entity95 , which is in the western part of @entity6			1
q : and are there worries now about reprisals ? @entity32 : yes , the @entity98 has already said monday that there will be reprisals , perhaps violent ones			0
we also know that members of parliament here in @entity20 have decided to close down the parliament here in protest of the killings			0
there is a lot of anger brewing			0
we know that there have been the villagers that have gathered outside of the base			0
of course , the funerals will happen on monday as well			0
so we 'll be getting more and more information from that area			0
but the anger is growing , and there 's a lot of speculation that this really plays right into the hands of the @entity98 , who is trying to sort of divide people and trying to say , " look , you ca n't really trust these coalition forces who claim to be here to help you			2
" the @entity2 government , @entity11 and @entity7 officials are looking into this , but there are a lot of people asking for swift justice and wanting the person who perpetrated this crime to be tried right here in @entity7			1
we do n't know if that 's likely to happen or not			2
q : and have you heard anything about how this affects the strategy moving forward in @entity7 ? @entity32 : yes , right now , everyone is just expressing their anger or sorrow or both over what happened			1
this is certainly going to strain ties again between the @entity7 government and the @entity2 president @entity14 has said he is deeply saddened by what happened and this is a deplorable and regrettable incident			1
but @entity7 president @entity172 has said this is unforgivable and an act of terror , in his words			1
and he , in a statement sunday , made it seem like he believed that there was actually some sort of a mission that went wrong			2
we 're still trying to clarify exactly what he meant by his words			0
but certainly , there is anger now , and there 's going to be a lot to get worked through because of this incident .			2
