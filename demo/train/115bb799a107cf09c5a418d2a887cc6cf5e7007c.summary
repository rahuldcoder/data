-- if fans thought season one of " @entity3 " was mysterious , get ready to spiral deeper down the rabbit hole for a second season			1
the show returns this saturday april 19 on @entity7			1
never heard of " @entity3 " ? for the uninitiated , " welcome to the trip , man , " as character @entity11 would say			1
it all unfolds in the first three minutes of the series premiere : a woman on a train platform witnesses another woman jump to her death -- and they 're identical			2
the witness , morally ambiguous @entity19 ( played by @entity20 ) , assumes the dead woman 's identity			2
it 's no spoiler to say that things do n't work out the way she planned			2
by taking on the identity of the deceased @entity28 , @entity19 discovers that @entity28 was in contact with other identical women who are actually clones			1
together , the clone sisters realize that some of their loved ones are really monitors for the mysterious @entity35 , overseeing the clone experiment			2
the clones can only trust one another as they try to unravel the mystery of their origins and the people who seek to control them			1
" it 's a crazy , fast - paced clone conspiracy thriller and a long - arc mystery , " co-creator and writer @entity43 told @entity0			2
the idea was heavily inspired by the mind - bending film " @entity49 , " and evolved into a multifaceted story dealing with themes of nature vs. nurture and identity theft			2
" we thought clones had n't really got their due			1
" for many , those first few glimpses hooked viewers and turned them into instant fans -- celebrities like @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 included -- and the # cloneclub community was born			2
why ' @entity3 ' works @entity20 @entity65 's unique embodiment of each clone , from tough girl @entity19 to geeky scientist @entity67 to high - strung soccer mom @entity69 , is fascinating to watch			1
she created a playlist of songs to help her develop personalities for each character			2
as for playing multiple clones in a single scene , @entity20 has acted against a double most recently			1
but she 's been known to rely on tennis balls with faces drawn on them and xs taped on the wall and floor			0
" watching her do these characters in a very substantial , complex , layered way really is what made this absolutely absurd idiotic premise work , " co-creator and director @entity81 told @entity0			1
while the campaign to get @entity20 nominated for an @entity89 did n't succeed ( and , as a result , incited the @entity91 ) , @entity20 was nominated for @entity92 and @entity93 , and won the @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity94			0
it ca n't be easy to portray so many different characters , but @entity20 makes it look effortless			1
" i kind of have to think about all of them [ ... ] just breathing and being there as that character , and letting that come out , with an awareness that i do have to move on from that person at the end of it , " @entity20 told @entity102			0
see @entity20 and more of @entity0 's 10 fresh faces for 2014 cliffhangers galore if you watch " @entity3 " regularly , you might have trust issues			1
every episode is a roller coaster of twists and turns that creates doubt before the audience can believe a character 's motives completely			0
@entity121 ( @entity122 ) , @entity28 's boyfriend , proves to be a chameleon			0
one minute , he seems loyal to @entity19 - as - @entity28			0
the next minute , he 's reporting on her activities to the @entity35			0
there is no lag time as the action stacks up back to back , usually pairing car chases and shootout scenes in between kidnappings and one clone masquerading as another			0
" we wanted cliffhangers every act break and left turns when you were n't expecting them and to generally keep the audience unbalanced , " @entity81 said			0
unconventional characters each clone is surrounded by a memorable cast of characters			1
from @entity19 's sassy foster brother @entity143 ( @entity143 ) to @entity67 's beautiful lover @entity144 ( @entity145 , ) " @entity3 " tends to celebrate the underdog			1
these gritty , flawed portrayals are n't the characters you normally see on tv and they are n't written as classic archetypes			1
@entity19 is a con artist with a checkered past , but she 's also a fiercely protective mother to her young daughter , @entity153			0
@entity67 is n't played as your average geek -- she 's quirky , making a brilliant discovery about clone dna one second and smoking pot the next			0
dr. @entity158 ( @entity159 ) of the @entity35 is as charmingly likeable as he is terrifyingly controlling			0
not only have fans identified with each clone , but the representations of @entity164 characters like @entity143 and @entity67 as well			1
" i take joy in playing someone who is so liberated , not just in his sexuality , but his work as an artist , and his life , " @entity143 said			0
" he 's not perfect , he 's an antihero with a lot of flaws ( most of them powder - related ) , but he is a fully realized human being			0
" clone science @entity81 has become accustomed to hearing people say , " i do n't normally like sci - fi , but i love your show			1
" that 's probably because cloning and body augmentation is played as modern science , rather than futuristic science fiction			0
the fictional @entity35 explores the ethical complications of when science plays @entity188			0
it poses a question largely explored in @entity190 : when you 're a clone , who really " owns " you and your dna ? what to expect in @entity190 now that you 're caught up , the new season will catapult from last year 's finale			1
" @entity190 does two things , " @entity43 told @entity0			0
" it continues our fast pace and momentum and opens up our mysteries while giving some answers			1
" specifically , this means the addition of threatening characters ( think religious extremists ) and delving into @entity67 's mysterious illness that could endanger all of the clones , while further exploring a clone we met at the end of season 1 : @entity212			1
the ruthless corporate pro-clone and @entity19 's nemesis is actually @entity65 's favorite to play , and a large focus of the second season			1
the relationships between characters will shift as well			1
" @entity19 and @entity143 will be tested , there 's some contention there , " @entity143 said			0
" i wanted to establish @entity143 outside of the clones , and the only way to do that is to put a wedge between him and @entity19			1
but i think the audience will understand it when we get there			0
" the biggest question shaping @entity190 : who took @entity19 's daughter , @entity153 , at the end of season 1 ? as the only child born to a clone , plenty of people have good reason for viewing her as a scientific goldmine			2
and it appears we may not be finished with meeting all of the clones			2
@entity81 added that learning what the fans liked from season one and the strong response from the " clone club " inspired the entire " @entity253 " team to pull out all of the stops for @entity190			2
" the clone club community has been so inclusive and such a source of respectful conversation online , " @entity143 said			0
" it 's the society we want			0
there 's no need for boxes or labels			0
we would all rejoice in a world where everyone is accepted			0

season 2 of " @entity3 " returns april 19
taking on the topic of clones , and using one *actress* to play them , makes the show stand out
