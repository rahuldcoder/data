@entity3 fighters defending the key @entity5 border city of @entity6 are dangerously outmatched as @entity8 advances , a top @entity1 official said tuesday , calling for the international community to step in			1
" they have been defending themselves with great courage			0
but they are now very close to not being able to do so			0
they are fighting with normal weapons , whereas the @entity8 has got tanks and mortars , " @entity16 , the @entity1 special envoy for @entity5 , said in a statement			1
" the international community needs to defend them			1
the international community can not sustain another city falling under @entity8			1
" were @entity6 to fall , @entity8 would control a complete swath of land between its self - declared capital of @entity27 , @entity5 , and @entity28 -- a stretch of more than 100 kilometers ( 62 miles )			1
outnumbered and outgunned by @entity8 , local fighters trying to defend the @entity3 - dominated city have tried to flee into @entity28			1
@entity28 president @entity32 warned that @entity6 was about to fall to @entity8 as protests raged in his country over how the group should be handled			1
and hours after @entity39 airstrikes targeting @entity8 struck near @entity6 overnight , the city 's future was far from certain			1
stopping @entity8 from taking over cities , towns and other territory in @entity5 is n't the focus of @entity39 efforts , a senior administration official and a @entity39 official told @entity47			1
at a briefing , a @entity49 spokeswoman faced persistent questions over whether saving the city was a @entity39 priority			1
the answer , @entity47 global affairs correspondent @entity54 said , sounded like a resounding " no. " " it 's obviously horrific to watch what 's going on the ground , but it 's important for the @entity39 , for us to also step back and remember our strategic objective as it relates to our efforts and our engagement in @entity5 , " spokeswoman @entity56 told reporters			2
the @entity39 goal , she said , is " a deliberate , well thought - out campaign in @entity5 " to disrupt @entity8 command and control , destroy the group 's infrastructure and attack sources of fuel and financing for @entity8			1
" certainly no one wants to see @entity6 fall , but our primary objective here is preventing ( @entity8 ) from gaining a safe haven , " she said			1
" and we 're going after those specific structures that i mentioned , " @entity56 added			0
" but we would not have taken the range of military strikes we have taken , including overnight , if we did not want to support and -- and defend the area			0
" five airstrikes targeting groups of @entity8 fighters struck near @entity6 overnight , @entity84 said			1
there were another four strikes elsewhere in @entity5 and four in @entity90			2
" finally , they are hitting the right places , " one local fighter against @entity8 said after the airstrikes near @entity6 , which is close to the @entity28 border and key to @entity8 ' effort to extend its terrain			1
airstrikes against the radical @entity103 group in @entity6 can be challenging because many targets are too close to the @entity28 border or @entity3 forces to strike , a senior @entity39 military official said			1
violent protests in @entity28 destroying @entity8 will require ground operations , @entity32 said , according to the semi-official @entity110 news agency			1
speaking to @entity5 refugees , he said there has been " no achievement yet , " despite months of efforts against @entity8			2
@entity32 called for a no - fly zone , and for the arming of opposition groups in @entity90 and @entity5			1
people upset over what they consider @entity28 's failure to respond adequately to the @entity8 threat launched protests in @entity28 , some of which turned violent			1
three people were killed and at least 36 injured in demonstrations throughout @entity28 , police said , according to @entity110			2
at least five @entity28 police officers were among the injured , @entity110 said			2
there were clashes overnight in @entity131 , and a group of about 50 to 60 protesters blocked a road , @entity47 affiliate @entity135 reported			0
some demonstrators set fire to a bus and garbage truck and smashed windows and cars			0
one protester was killed in the middle of a demonstration after being hit in the head by a gas canister in the town of @entity149 , police said			0
and two protesters died during demonstrations in the southeastern province of @entity153 , @entity110 reported			0
in @entity155 , meanwhile , @entity3 protesters stormed the @entity156			0
@entity47 affiliate @entity157 said about 50 protesters stormed into the building			0
police then cordoned it off			0
some @entity156 nations have joined the fight against @entity8 , but the @entity3 protesters want tougher action			2
@entity155 participated in overnight airstrikes in @entity90 , @entity84 said			2
@entity166 join in , @entity167 to follow suit @entity166 forces participated for the first time in airstrikes against @entity8 in @entity90 as well , dropping three bombs on @entity8 vehicles that were shooting at @entity176 forces , the @entity169 said in a statement			1
the vehicles were destroyed , and @entity8 fighters may have been killed , the ministry said			2
@entity167 's @entity180 approved an air combat mission against @entity8 in @entity90 , pledging up to six @entity183 fighter jets as part of a strike force , in addition to other aircraft for surveillance , reconnaissance and refueling			1
" to be absolutely clear , @entity167 's engagement in @entity90 is not a ground combat mission			1
it includes a number of targeted measures , being taken with allies , to severely limit the ability of @entity8 to engage in full scale military movements and to operate bases in the open , " prime minister @entity193 said in a statement			0
" we do not take this step lightly			0
the threat posed by @entity8 is real			0
if left unchecked this terrorist organization will grow and grow quickly			0
" near @entity6 , airstrikes hit @entity8 vehicles in @entity5 , according to @entity84 , the airstrikes against @entity8 included : -- one south of @entity6 destroyed three @entity8 armed vehicles and damaged another -- one southeast of @entity6 destroyed an @entity8 armed vehicle carrying anti-aircraft artillery -- two southwest of @entity6 damaged an @entity8 tank -- one south of @entity6 destroyed an @entity8 unit elsewhere in @entity5 , two strikes west of @entity219 hit multiple @entity8 buildings , one near @entity221 struck an @entity8 staging area and ied production facility , and one southwest of @entity225 struck a small group of @entity8 fighters			2
the @entity39 , @entity228 , and the @entity229 all participated in the strikes , @entity84 said			0
death toll in fight for @entity6 more than 400 people have been killed in the fight for @entity6 since mid-september , the @entity233 said			0
the group said it has documented the deaths of 219 isis jihadists , 163 members of the @entity3 militia , and 20 civilians			0
a northern @entity90 hospital has received the bodies of at least 29 suspected @entity8 militants , the head of the @entity244 hospital said tuesday			2
@entity248 said most were killed in @entity39 - led coalition airstrikes overnight			0
@entity244 is about 70 kilometers ( 43 miles ) west of @entity250 -- @entity90 's second - largest city			2
@entity250 has also been overtaken by @entity8 , which calls itself the @entity252			0
how @entity8 makes its millions why is @entity8 so successful at luring @entity254 ? @entity39 military airstrikes against @entity8 in @entity90 and @entity5 have cost more than $ 62 million so far , according to data provided by the @entity257			1
the data , apparently sent out inadvertently to the @entity257 's press contacts on monday , listed the total number of airstrikes by @entity84 in @entity90 and @entity5			0
it also detailed locations of targets and specified the costs of munitions used .			0

@entity167 will send fighter jets to target @entity8 in @entity90
