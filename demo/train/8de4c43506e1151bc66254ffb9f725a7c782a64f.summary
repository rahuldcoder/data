defense secretary @entity1 is ordering an independent review of the nation 's nuclear force following revelations of misconduct involving officers , the @entity0 said on thursday			1
top leaders of the force plan to meet with @entity11 in coming weeks , @entity0 spokesman rear adm. @entity8 said			0
the action follows a recent disclosure that nearly three dozen @entity15 officers at a nuclear missile base in @entity17 were involved in cheating on a proficiency test			1
that followed a decision by senior military officials to discipline a general with nuclear oversight responsibilities whose personal misbehavior involving alcohol and women on an overseas trip got him into hot water			1
@entity8 said " clearly , we 've got some issues here , " but added the @entity0 remains confident the @entity31 nuclear arsenal is secure			1
earlier this month , the @entity15 announced 34 officers with the @entity34 were implicated in the cheating scandal after a drug possession probe that involved two of those officers			0
sixteen officers were ultimately found to have actually cheated on the monthly proficiency exam while the rest knew the answers had been shared with others and did not report the violation , the @entity0 said			2
all those disciplined in the investigation are no longer certified to conduct nuclear operations			0
there are approximately 190 officers overseeing readiness of nuclear weapons systems in @entity17 , meaning the scandal has touched nearly 20 % of that force			0
other scandals include october 's news that air force maj. gen. @entity57 , who oversaw nuclear weapons , was relieved of his duties after he boozed , fraternized with " hot women " and disrespected his hosts during an official visit to @entity63 , @entity15 officials said			1
there was no indication @entity57 's behavior compromised sensitive nuclear information or went beyond drinking , dancing and fraternizing with the women , officials said			1
also in october , navy vice adm. @entity71 , who also oversaw nuclear weapons forces , was formally relieved of his duties as deputy chief of @entity75 , according to rear adm. @entity8 , the @entity77 's chief of information			0
a military official said his demotion was connected to allegations that he used counterfeit gambling chips at an @entity84 casino			0
in august , the same missile unit at @entity87 linked to the test cheating scandal failed a safety and security inspection " after making tactical - level errors -- not related to command and control of nuclear weapons , " the @entity85 said			2
the @entity34 operates about 150 of the 450 @entity96 nuclear - tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles in the @entity31 force , according to an @entity15 statement			2
a failed inspection does not mean that the safety of the nation 's nuclear arsenal is at risk , global strike commander lt. gen. @entity99 said in august			1
and in april , an air force commander stripped 17 of his officers in @entity107 , @entity108 , of their authority to control and launch nuclear missiles after they did poorly in an inspection			0
they were ordered to undergo 60 to 90 days of intensive refresher training on how to do their jobs .			0
