more than 90 % of the @entity0 was shut down in @entity1 thursday as rebel clashes with @entity4 's forces were reported near the @entity6 airport			1
it 's not the first time the @entity9 has been blocked in the war - torn country , but the move toward the airport could be highly significant , said retired @entity14 gen. @entity13 , who worked as assistant secretary of state for political - military affairs under president @entity16			1
@entity6 , the capital , is the seat of @entity4 's power			1
it is also home to many @entity1 who belong to the @entity22 sect			1
rebels fighting @entity4 's forces and possibly winning at or near the airport " would have a psychological affect , " @entity13 explained			1
" the civilians in @entity6 will feel cut off from the outside world			1
" the @entity22 , he said , understand there are very few alternatives other than staying in @entity1 now , but if rebels take the airport , they would likely feel trapped			1
some will go on about their lives , a coping mechanism , he said			0
some will flee to neighborhood countries , while others may actually choose to take a stronger position in defending @entity4			1
strategically , @entity13 noted that most of the military 's aircraft are being flown out of bases elsewhere in the country			2

" the @entity1 government has been monitoring ( the @entity0 ) for years			1

" but @entity13 , asked by @entity107 to respond to @entity95 's comments , said he thinks the gear that @entity96 has provided has not been enough			1
" i think it 's an attempt on the part of the ( @entity142 ) administration , albeit it has an insufficient amount of support for the rebels , " the former general said			2
" what side of history are we going to end up ? " to suggest a thousand pieces of equipment has made a difference -- i would turn back to the number of casualties we 've seen			0
