the horrific bombing at the finish line of the @entity2 on monday reminds us of both our physical vulnerability and the fragility of our peace of mind			1
even as we grieve for the victims and worry about friends and family in the vicinity , because these were bombings -- clearly an act of terror on someone 's part -- they shake us			1
we are touched to the core as we have been by 9/11			1
old familiar questions that have been tamped down for years re-emerge			0
how do we make ourselves safe ? can we ? and of course , we ask : who ? why ? for us , the first duty in the wake of the @entity25 attacks is to make sure that no additional related threats remain			1
at the same time , we must care for those injured in the attacks and the families of those who lost their lives			1
but @entity31 taught us one more thing			0
we must care for ourselves , for the truth			2
we must fight to retain our equilibrium and our cool			2
earlier this month at a @entity37 in @entity38 , police discussed an approach that law enforcement has encouraged in recent years in the event of attacks like mass shootings : often the right thing to do is to take action , rather than run away			0
this makes some sense , particularly if there is a visible perpetrator to pursue or victims to aid			2
but in the moments after an attack , we need to remember , too , that reflection and careful , fact - based analysis is more important than reflexive acts that appear to respond to but only compound the terror and , ultimately , the costs of the attack			1
in the hours immediately after the @entity25 attacks , there were the understandable , prudent reactions			1
@entity63 and @entity38 entered heightened states of alert			0
friends and families texted and called one another asking whether their loved ones should leave @entity25			1
no doubt others organizing public events in the next few weeks or months began to rethink their security precautions			0
president @entity73 's brief , measured remarks expressing sympathy for the victims , resolve to seek justice and a commitment to providing full federal support for state and local authorities was a perfect example of an appropriate response			1
but elsewhere it was fevered			0
the @entity84 exploded with graphic images and rumors and reactions and over-reactions			0
it captured the hysteria of a crowd , the diverse mix of healthy and unhealthy reactions , almost as a photograph would : a high resolution picture of the state of mind of countless bystanders and interested parties			1
reading the tweets and the first stories , hearing of ground stoppages at airports and security moves at the @entity106 , it was all too easy to remember the mood in the wake of 9/11 , a moment in history when justified horror fed panic			2
but this was translated into a crackdown on civil liberties , an unnecessary war — and some very dark days for the @entity117			0
tragedies like these call for swift response from police and emergency workers , not to mention @entity124 officials			2
but experience tells us that the ultimate accessories to the terrorist are the innocent and well - intentioned who spread and exaggerate the terror			1
just as we should track down perpetrators , we should also remember that if we remain calm and rational , we can minimize the effectiveness of these acts and in so doing make them less attractive for terrorists to undertake			1
this is how people in countries plagued with violence , like @entity140 , have long handled attacks			0
be resolute about security , intelligence and enforcement			0
but place equal emphasis on maintaining order and ensuring the minimum possible disruption of daily life			2
with more than 100 casualties reported at the time of this writing , it is easy to let anguish fuel anger and worse			0
sadly , we have been here before			0
it is time we used past lessons to ensure that we respond today and in the future better than we have in the past — with equal parts of both purpose and perspective , with as much focus on maintaining life as usual as in dealing with its cruel disruption .			0

@entity166 : @entity25 blasts remind us of our vulnerability and fragility of state of mind
he says first duties : care for victims , assess threat . then , keep cool ; this a lesson of 9/11
he says too - quick response to terror can compound its effects , encourage terrorists
@entity166 : we *'ve* been here before . crucial to stay calm , rational , maintain order
