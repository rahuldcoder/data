-- she 's a perfect 10 ; the surfer that other professionals will drag themselves out of the water to watch			1
but it is the satisfaction of being able to help her family that ranks as @entity10 's proudest achievement			1
the diminutive @entity14 , twice a runner - up on the women 's @entity12 , is seen as a pioneer in her sport who is still pushing the boundaries at the age of 28			1
that talent has taken her round the globe and offered rewards that she has been able to divert back to her family in the north western state of @entity27			2
" surfing has helped me a lot , " the sole @entity14 representative of the elite 17 competitors on the women 's tour told @entity0 's @entity33 series			1
" my success was the fact that i was able to help out others			0
" to have been able to leave my hometown , and being able to help out my family , who did n't have good enough conditions to eat , to study			0
" @entity34 was amazing ; it arrived in the best moment for me			0
it took me away from my hometown and got me where i am today			0
" i already helped my @entity45 , gave her a house and helped my brother a lot			0
" after becoming besotted with the sport at the age of five , @entity51 's path to the elite level was clearly defined ever since she eschewed a possible career in soccer to focus on surfing			1
and that decision was vindicated when she became the first woman to ever record a perfect score of 10 for her ride during a competition in @entity62 in 2005			1
" it 's a wonderful memory , " she explains			1
" it was my first wave and it was @entity66 in @entity62			0
i managed to be on the first beautiful , beautiful wave			0
" i remember i dropped down -- i still have that image in my mind today -- entering the tube and pumping , pumping , pumping			0
it was a great maneuver			0
i knew then that it was going to be a 10			2
" @entity10 has since gone on to record two more perfect rides to enhance the reputation she holds for a progressive , all - action style that even her peers find intoxicating			1
full of dynamic set - pieces , @entity51 spends a healthy portion of her competition performances tucked in the barrel of a wave or using it as a ramp to propel her into the air -- a move known as an aerial			1
" it 's a very hard maneuver to execute , because you are just taking off from a wave with the board under your feet and you land , " @entity10 said			1
" it 's very difficult and you have various types of aerials			2
it 's my favorite because it took me a long time to learn that maneuver			2
the feeling that you get from taking off from a wave and completing that maneuver is wonderful			0
" after the aerial , the barrel is the best			0
you feel like you are in your mother 's womb -- it 's special			2
" in the barrel you are inside the wave and you see that image in front of you , the door of the barrel for you to exit and you feel like , ' wow , i 'm inside the barrel			0
' " you stay there just riding it and when you leave you feel like it was the best maneuver you have ever made			0
" as competition surfing continues to evolve , more and more professionals are taking the aerial route			1
but as surfers strive for greater heights by taking on moves of greater complexity , the danger is increased and , in turn , the risk of injury -- a topic @entity10 knows all about			1
she spent the whole of the 2012 season on the sidelines after tearing her anterior cruciate ligament during a competition on the @entity135 in @entity136			2
it meant a third bout of similar surgery and an exhaustive rehabilitation process , though she did receive an injury wild card to compete on the 2013 tour			2
" i remember all three moments , all three surgeries and it 's not a very good memory , " she said			2
" i feel sad and happy at the same time because i 've got through it and that makes me feel good but to remember how it all happened is bad			0
" ( the most recent injury ) was turning around while doing a maneuver and while my body was twisting , my leg remained in the same position , so i basically just twisted my body			0
@entity14 's best beaches " when you have pain in your knee or anywhere else in your body , you want to get back into the water to do what you have always done , to give 100 %			1
" i want it to stop there and not have any more surgeries , to feel 100 % by doing everything right : gym , physiotherapy , good diet , sleep well , be a complete professional ! " i think if i do everything right , @entity172 wo n't let those things happen to me again			0
" though @entity10 has been part of the fabric of the women 's tour for a decade , she is still more than holding her own against much younger competitors and proudly flying the flag for @entity14			1
" my biggest dream is to be world champion , " @entity10 said			1
" it 's really important for me to be here among the best surfers in the world -- the only @entity14			1
i 'm really happy and proud of myself , and want to keep on improving			0
