-- it was supposed to be part of the magic of taking the @entity4 to @entity5 , that a city deep in the heart of the legendary @entity9 rainforest would be hosting matches			1
barring major mishap , this will come to pass but the @entity13 in @entity14 may well become a venue that is remembered more for tragedy than any football theater			1
for the 42,000 - seater arena , whose four matches include the clash between former world champions @entity22 and @entity23 , has been beset by problems during construction			1
on friday , @entity26 became the third worker to die while working in or near the ground , a tally that accounts for half the fatalities during construction of the 12 stadiums for june 's finals			1
the 55 - year - old died after being struck on the head by a piece of falling iron as a crane that had been used to build the stadium 's roof was dismantled outside the arena in northern @entity5			2
a hospital statement later said that a combination of head and chest injuries had caused @entity26 ' death			0
" with great sadness we send our sincere condolences to the family , on behalf of both @entity48 and the @entity53 , " wrote @entity48 secretary general @entity47 on @entity49			0
work at the @entity13 , which football 's world governing body @entity48 had wanted to be finished in december , is one of several stadiums in @entity5 running behind schedule - with just 125 days to go before the tournament begins			2
in december , @entity60 died after falling nearly 35 meters from the roof of the stadium			0
the 22 - year - old 's death , which followed @entity14 ' first fatality in march 2013 , prompted his fellow construction workers to go on strike until they received assurances of improved safety conditions			1
these appear to still be in some doubt following the death of @entity26 , a @entity71 national			0
a statement was released by @entity5 's sports minister @entity73 expressing regret for the death			0
" @entity76 laments the death of worker @entity26 , victim of an accident at the construction site of the @entity13 , on friday , in @entity14 , " he said			1
" personally and in the name of the federal government , i express deep regret and express my feelings and solidarity with the family and friends of the worker			0
" it is wording with which @entity90 is becoming depressingly familiar , having released a nearly identical statement in the wake of @entity60 's death			0
two other workers were killed last november in @entity95 , following the collapse of a crane at the stadium set to host the opening game of the finals on june 12 , while another died in @entity102			2
the @entity14 stadium will also stage the following matches : @entity106 - @entity105 , @entity108 - @entity107 and @entity110 - @entity109			1
news of the death came a day after fierce clashes between police and citizens of @entity116 as the latter protested over increased public transport costs			0
many @entity5 are unhappy about the huge governmental spending on the @entity4 when they say such public services as schools , hospitals and infrastructure are in desperate need of repair .			2
