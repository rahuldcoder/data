@entity2 friends remember @entity3 , a mother of three , as someone who was n't careless or put others at risk			2
but the @entity8 she was driving tuesday evening suddenly moved into the path of @entity11 train , triggering the deadliest crash in the history of the @entity2 commuter railroad , a safety official said			1
the engineer saw the suv and applied the emergency brake as the train traveled at 58 mph , just under the speed limit of 60 , @entity16 member @entity15 said thursday			1
it was 6:26 p.m. the train sounded its horn appropriately			1
the flashing lights and gates at the crossing functioned properly , officials said			0
the eight - car train stopped 950 feet after the brake was applied , @entity15 said			1
that 's about the distance that the suv was dragged			1
@entity33 and five train passengers were killed			1
a witness who was driving a car behind the suv told the @entity16 that the vehicle stopped at the crossing tuesday night			1
the suv driver came out of her vehicle after her rear window was struck by a gate			2
the warning lights activated 39 seconds before the collision , the @entity16 said			0
the gates came down a few seconds later -- leaving the suv in the train 's path about half a minute			1
the witness told investigators that he saw flashing lights that signaled the approaching train			2
he said he backed up slightly and gestured at @entity33 to back up away from the gate			0
she returned to the vehicle and , in what seemed like " enough time to put on a seat belt , " suddenly moved the suv forward into the train 's path , @entity15 said			1
" what we have here is ... a mosaic , " @entity15 said			0
" we 're going to take different pieces of information ... assemble it and see what that picture looks like			0
" the goal , he said , is to construct " a timeline so we know exactly what happened and when			0
" @entity73 , a railroad expert and former professor at @entity76 in @entity77 , said oncoming trains rarely can stop in time for vehicles on tracks			2
" it is a physical reality , " he said			0
" the train 's ' failure to stop ' is not a surprise or a cause of the accident ... this accident was unfortunate bad luck ... it is a constant battle against vehicles on road crossings			1
" the @entity8 driver and other motorists had been diverted to the area of the rail crossing after another unrelated accident on a nearby parkway , according to the @entity16			1
more than a dozen other people were injured in the crash			1
it 's not known why the suv stopped on the tracks in @entity101 , about 30 miles north of @entity2 , the @entity16 said			1
@entity15 said he believed @entity33 had owned the @entity8 a short period of time			1
' she had just a beautiful soul ' " this was a tragic accident and you wonder why it happened , but certainly this it was not her , " said @entity106 , @entity33 's longtime friend			2
" she was not a careless person			0
she would not ever do anything that would put anybody at risk			0
" a mother of three girls , @entity33 , 49 , worked at a jewelry store for 10 years , according to friends			0
she had just left the store when she was killed			2
" her girls really adore her , " said @entity123 , rabbi at @entity124 of the @entity125			0
" her husband and her were very close			0
it 's really just a beautiful family unit			2
" @entity130 , a co-worker at the store , said : " in one word ... she just had a beautiful soul			0
she looked for the good in others			0
she was , she looked for the good			0
" @entity33 's actions behind the wheel moments before the crash are a focus of the investigation , officials said			1
" there are two big questions here : why was the car on the train tracks ? " @entity15 asked			1
" and what caused this accident to be fatal for occupants of the train ? " @entity15 said the @entity16 is also examining the train 's exits , the " crashworthiness " of the rail cars , and the intensity of the fire -- which may have been fueled by the suv 's gas tank			1
some 400 feet of the electrified third rail perforated the first rail car and part of the second in 80 - foot sections " breaking apart section by section , just basically piling up " in the cars , according to the @entity16			0
