" the chilling details came during @entity19 's second day on the stand			1
the defense team is trying to convince the jury that @entity19 was a desperate mother ultimately driven to kill @entity52 because she felt caught between her two ex-husbands			1
one ex-husband had allegedly threatened to kill her , a crime that would have left @entity52 with her other ex , his biological father , who she believed had sexually abused the boy			1

on wednesday , @entity19 , fighting back tears , testified that she knowingly gave herself and @entity52 enough drugs to kill them both			1
