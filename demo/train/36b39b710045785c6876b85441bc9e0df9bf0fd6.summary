" we 're really happy she 's been released on bail , " @entity21 of @entity2 said tuesday			2
she said she learned of @entity9 's release monday through @entity2 's researchers in @entity26 , @entity27 , and from @entity9 's family and friends			1
@entity30 , a journalism professor at the university and an academic adviser to @entity9 , confirmed the young woman 's release in an e-mail			2
@entity30 said they were waiting to see what will " happen next in terms of charges or conditions or sentencing			0
" the university will hold a rally and vigil wednesday calling for @entity9 's return to @entity46 , she said			1
the event had been planned before @entity9 's release			1
@entity21 , the @entity4 specialist for @entity49 , said she did not know the exact bail amount , only that @entity9 's parents had handed over the deed to their home in @entity4 in return for their daughter 's release			1
" this is a real problem for her family because the state of their home is in doubt , " @entity21 said , adding that if the @entity4 government determines @entity9 has violated the bail conditions , it can take her family 's home			1
@entity21 said @entity9 has not been charged , " but there is some indication that they 're planning on charging her			2
" @entity20 's deputy general prosecutor , @entity73 , has " deliberately leaked " to the state - run media his intentions to charge @entity9 with propaganda against the state , @entity21 said			1
the @entity4 judiciary has not commented on @entity9 's release			1
" a lot of people have faced that charge , " @entity21 said			0
" it 's kind of a vague , loosely worded charge that 's kind of convenient			0
they can use it against whomever they want basically			0
" @entity21 said @entity9 is not the only woman involved with @entity15 who has been jailed recently ; at least three women who worked with the group are being detained , she said			2
@entity93 was arrested in october 2007 and charged with enmity with @entity95 , a charge akin to treason , and is being held in @entity98 ; @entity101 , 21 , recently was sentenced to 18 months at @entity98 for gathering and colluding to commit a crime against national security ; and @entity104 , 26 , was sentenced in august to four years at @entity105 for belonging to an illegal group , the @entity99 of @entity100 , @entity21 said			2
as of tuesday morning , the @entity4 government had not returned @entity9 's passport and travel papers , @entity21 said , adding that " there is a pattern that after people are released from detention they are still kept in @entity4			1
" among the examples , @entity21 said , are @entity116 , an @entity4 - @entity6 scholar with the @entity118 in @entity119 , and @entity120 , a @entity121 - @entity4 journalism student at the @entity122			2
@entity116 , 67 , was arrested in 2007 while visiting her ailing mother in @entity4			2
she was charged with harming national security and held for 105 days in @entity19			0
she was released august 21 , 2007 , after her mother posted $ 330,000 bail , but did not leave @entity4 until september 2 , 2007			0
@entity120 was arrested in february 2007 and accused of " trying to make a propaganda film , " according to @entity128			0
she was released from @entity19 the following month after her parents ' house was offered as bail , but @entity120 was not allowed to leave @entity4 until january , the group reported			1
@entity9 's father , @entity133 , initially condemned his daughter 's arrest , saying that even if she confessed to a crime , " anything my daughter may say in solitary confinement is worthless , " according to @entity140 , a news web site run by exiled @entity4 journalists			1
the father gave a different account to the state - run @entity145 last week , however , and said he was angry that his daughter had engaged in " illegal activities			0
" " i got so angry that i and her mother decided not visit her , " he told @entity145 on friday			0
" i deny all that has been attributed to me by web sites and believe them to be the personal interpretations of the reporters			0
" he added , " as an @entity4 , i love my country and do not wish any harm to the @entity145 republic			0
" @entity157 , coordinator for the @entity158 , said it was not clear under what circumstances @entity9 's father talked to @entity145 , but the remarks seem " very suspect			1
" " it really does n't make any sense for him to make a verdict on his daughter 's guilt , " @entity157 said saturday , the day after the @entity145 report was published			0
@entity0 could not reach @entity133 for comment tuesday			0
since @entity9 's arrest became public , @entity2 , other human rights organizations and her university have called for her immediate release			1
" we have concern for this young person because , like many young people , she is a dreamer , she 's a thinker , she 's a researcher , " university provost @entity175 said last month			0
@entity9 " has the best interests of young people and women in her mind , " he said			2
the @entity187 - born graduate student had been filming footage for a project on the women 's rights movement , and interviewing volunteers for the @entity15 , launched in 2006 by @entity15			1
the campaign seeks to collect signatures on a petition demanding that @entity4 rewrite its constitution to recognize men and women as equal			2
according to the @entity14 newspaper , the @entity14 , fellow graduate student @entity197 said @entity9 was " determined to better the lives of @entity4 citizens			1
" @entity201 , chairwoman of the school 's gender and women 's studies department , told the paper she , too , was involved in the campaign and had advised @entity133 on her work			1
" she has not been a part of any political parties , any clandestine movements , " @entity201 said			0
" she has done nothing wrong			0
" @entity157 said he believes @entity20 wants to stifle the women 's rights movement , and @entity9 's arrest was meant to intimidate like - minded scholars or activists			1
" we see here detention as a method of pressuring that movement on a broader scale , " he said			0
" the government would very much like to quiet these women			0
" @entity0 's @entity223 contributed to this report .			0
