-- the @entity2 website is open for business			0
but the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , is closed			0
because republicans in half the states have blocked the expansion of @entity13 , funds to public hospitals with large uninsured populations have been slashed			1
so far , at least five public hospitals have been closed this year and 5,000 hospital employees have been laid off nationwide			1
the closures are expected to worsen in the coming years			0
in @entity6 , as many as 15 more rural hospitals may close " within months " and in @entity18 , which is putting off a decision on expanding @entity13 , almost half of the 61 rural hospitals in the state might face " major cuts or closure			1
" this is a direct — and disastrous — consequence of @entity10 ' ideological opposition to @entity2			2
when the @entity2 was originally passed , subsidies to hospitals with large uninsured " charity care " populations were cut , figuring that the expansion of @entity13 under the law would replace this funding			1
but then the @entity34 ruled that states could decide whether to expand @entity13 or not			2
half the states have said they will not extend @entity13 or are putting off deciding			2
these are states mostly controlled by @entity10 governors , state legislatures , or both			2
there was really no downside to extending @entity13 to cover individuals who earn up to 133 % of the federal poverty level			2
the federal government is covering 100 % of the cost of @entity13 for the next two years and 90 % afterward			2
columnist @entity52 has pointed out the bind : " ( @entity55 ) hen @entity10 state officials decline to participate , they will have to explain to both medical providers and potential @entity13 beneficiaries that they turned down free federal money just to spite the president			1
" and yet the 25 states that have indeed refused @entity13 expansion will soon find they 're not just spiting the president but also their own citizens			1
the people who rely on these " essential hospitals " are n't just low - income folks			0
middle - class @entity64 who live in rural communities will have to travel 40 or 50 miles just to reach the nearest emergency room if these hospitals close their doors			0
according to @entity71 , @entity70 crashed her four - wheeler in @entity5 , @entity6 , and suffered painful second - and third - degree burns on nearly half her body			0
but her local hospital had shut down			0
it took two hours for her to get to an ambulance center 20 miles away and then on to a hospital in @entity79 where she could get treatment			0
as more of these horror stories emerge and as more hospitals close , even the most diehard @entity10 voters in these rural communities wo n't care about ideological grandstanding			1
they 'll just want their hospitals open			0
on the heels of news of rural hospitals shuttering come reports that health care costs overall are falling and that the cost of @entity2 is expected to be billions of dollars less than expected			1
of course , some of the decline in health care cost is certainly the result of a still - sluggish economy			1
yet does anyone doubt that if health care costs had risen in the same period to even a fraction of a degree , @entity10 would be screaming from the rooftops , blaming @entity2 ? we might not be able to expect fervent @entity105 ideologues to act rationally in the face of facts — but what we can expect is that their constituents will be even more vexed to see that as health care costs nationwide are falling , the hospitals on which they depend are closing			1
desperate to try to blame everything and the weather on the @entity2 , @entity10 have tried to pin the cuts in subsidies to hospitals on the dynamics of the law alone			2
a spokesperson for @entity6 's @entity120 gov. @entity120 blamed the @entity2 for cutting subsidies to the hospitals that treat the uninsured while refusing to acknowledge the governor 's power to expand @entity13 at the state level and solve the entire crisis			2
you heard that right : republicans like @entity129 , constantly railing against the federal government and clamoring for " state 's rights , " are suddenly abdicating state responsibility and blaming the feds for not fixing the problem			0
it 's the same hypocritical dynamic at work in more than 30 states that have turned their roles in setting up health insurance exchanges over to the federal government			0
it seems republicans want state authority when it comes to pushing their conservative agenda but not when it comes to providing basic health care and access to insurance for their residents			1
not that republicans at the federal level are any more responsible			0
@entity156 refused to pass a law that would have delayed the subsidy cuts for rural hospitals until more states decide whether they 're extending @entity13			1
these acts of ideological intransigence by @entity10 at the federal and state levels will not hurt @entity2			0
the @entity2 is the law of the land , its components are broadly popular with the majority of @entity64 people and it will only become more so as it is fully implemented and most people see the quality of their care go up as their costs go down			0
no , republicans are only hurting their constituents — folks in redder parts of red states who rely on rural hospitals for emergency room treatment , oncology visits , maternity wards and other basic care			1
purely for ideological reasons , @entity10 are creating a health care crisis — in their own states			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			0

@entity10 states blocked expansion of @entity13 , and public hospitals are closing
@entity188 : medicaid expansion was meant to provide funding for these hospitals
@entity188 : republicans put ideology over health care ; refused to delay cuts to hospitals
@entity188 : states trying to spite @entity206 will find they are only hurting their own people
