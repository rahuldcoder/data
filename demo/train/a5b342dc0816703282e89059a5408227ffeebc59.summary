-- a 35 % increase in demand for air travel			0
a tripling of the region 's airplane fleet			1
up to nearly 13,000 new planes needed			1
predictions for growth in the @entity11 aviation industry over the next two decades are impressive			1
but one question keeps recurring in the region and , indeed , around the globe			0
will there be enough pilots to fly the new planes and enough technicians to maintain them ? " the airlines say , ' ok , we 've just bought a bunch of airplanes and we 've put in all our funding into the airplane , ' " says @entity21 , vice president of @entity22 , a @entity23 - based aviation training company			1
" now where does the funding come in to train the pilots , to train the engineers , to train even the management people , to keep these airplanes operational and safe and flying ? that 's the biggest challenge that we 're facing			1
" 100 flight schools ' still not enough ' @entity22 runs training for a number of @entity11 - based airlines , including the privately owned @entity42 carrier @entity41			1
earlier in february , the low - cost carrier signed a $ 6.4 billion contract with @entity45 for 63 new single - aisle a320 planes , the lease of seven and the option to buy a further 30 aircraft			0
like so many of @entity11 's low cost carriers , however , @entity41 is struggling to recruit enough personnel to fulfill its lofty ambitions , due to what @entity21 describes as an " extremely serious " shortage of pilots			1
" all the airlines in @entity42 are heavily dependent on international pilots , " says @entity21			1
" they 're competing from the same pool of pilots as the @entity61 , with the growth of @entity23 , the growth of @entity64			1
it 's that same pool that all these airlines are competing for , so it 's a big challenge in @entity42			1
" @entity22 has been working with @entity41 since it was founded in 2011 , training engineers , technicians and cabin crew			1
at february 's @entity70 , @entity22 and @entity71 of @entity72 signed a @entity73 with @entity42 's @entity74 ( @entity75 ) , to open a flight school in @entity42 , focused on training pilots			1
" even if we set up 100 airplane flying schools tomorrow , it still would n't be enough , " says @entity21			1
" the shortage is that extreme			0
" half a million pilots needed globally released in august 2013 , the @entity84 and @entity85 for 2013 - 2032 forecasts nearly half a million new commercial airline pilots will be needed to fly all the new airplanes entering the world fleet over the next 20 years			1
the problem is acute in @entity11			1
there the @entity84 report says the explosion in demand for air travel will mean 192,300 new pilots will be required by 2032 , including 77,400 , or 40 % of them , in @entity97			1
it 's an issue the industry is working to address			1
" what we can do is partner with governments , partner with training agencies , partner with airlines and focus a training curriculum that allows the training of those pilots , " says @entity100 , vice president of marketing for @entity101			1
" we 're trying to get out in front of it			0
" together with partner airlines , @entity84 runs pilot training schools in @entity23 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity97			2
ground crew also in short supply @entity84 's chief competitor @entity45 has a training school in @entity124 and last week announced a new joint venture with @entity126 to set up a $ 64 million facility , offering full pilot training in @entity23			1
@entity22 works in @entity97 , too , with joint venture training centers in @entity130 in central northwest @entity97 and in @entity132 southeast of @entity124			0
as in @entity42 , the country is heavily dependent on foreign pilots because of the shortage of trained locals			2
@entity21 says pilots in @entity97 are paid 25 % more than anywhere else in the region , and even then airlines have problems holding on to them for any more than a couple of years			1
but he warns there 's an even more pressing area of concern in the region			2
" everybody talks about the sexy industry of pilots , " he says			2
" nobody talks about the poor mechanic who 's in the hangar working day and night , in sweat , rain and humidity			2
" " that 's challenge number one -- attract the talent pool , because a lot of kids just say , ' yeah i 'd rather be an it guy , work in an air - conditioned office , rather than be standing in these conditions working on an airplane , ' " says @entity21			1
" so that 's a big , big challenge to attract the right talent			2
" according to @entity84 's @entity166 , @entity11 will need 215,300 new maintenance technicians to service the new airplanes entering the region between now and 2032			1
that 's 43 % of the projected global demand for technicians			2
@entity173 is a @entity174 - based aviation analyst for @entity175 , a government and commercial consultancy based in the @entity177			0
" you can get a new pilot in 18 months , " he says			0
" you can take it from zero , to being in the right hand seat , in 18 months			0
it might worry some people , but that 's the truth			2
" " and if you 're growing at @entity186 you can go and recruit out of a low - fare carrier because the pilot at the low - fare carrier wants to fly a bigger plane			0
so the people who 've got the problem finding the pilots are the low - fare carriers , the bottom of the food chain			2
" mechanics take five years before you can sign off a plane certificate for release			1
so the supply chain is much more difficult there because it takes longer for it to react			2
" same problems , new solution ? @entity173 says pilot shortages have been talked about for years , as has the shortage of mechanics in the @entity209 , yet somehow the issue always gets sorted out			1
" the market 's going to double over the next 15 to 20 years , but remember it doubled over the last 15 to 20 years that we 've just come through , " he says			1
" it 's something we can manage through , but we have to get out ahead of it			2
" relatively hidden among the thousand - plus exhibitors at last week 's @entity70 was a small @entity219 - based company called @entity220 , which says it has the software to help contribute to the industry getting ahead			2
@entity220 does virtual maintenance training for military aircraft , including the @entity225 and the @entity226			0
during a demonstration , in what looks like a video game , a maintenance technician circles an aircraft , in @entity232			0
@entity220 president @entity233 says his company is engaging the digital generation by giving them a platform they can relate to , with real training value			0
" the aircraft 's always running just like it would be in the real world , " he says			2
" so if somebody goes and pulls the wire somewhere or breaks a wire , the whole aircraft will then function in the way that it does in the real world			0
it 's a much more realistic training			2
" @entity220 global sales manager @entity250 says by using software , you can train more cheaply , more quickly and more effectively			0
" stereotypical maintenance training right now is all done with hardware , " says @entity250			0
" hardware 's extremely expensive to build and it breaks a lot			0
so if you go into a virtual world and you break something , all you need to do is hit reset and you can continue your training			0
" the company hopes to break into the market for training commercial aircraft maintenance technicians , but concedes this could still be some years away			0
" we find the commercial guys are a little bit slower to adopt things than the military , " says @entity233			0
" the military likes to try things out and then validate it			0
" " the commercial guys seem to want to wait until the military 's done all that , make sure it works right and then they take a look at it			0
so we 're kind of at that point right now			0
" as technology improves , simulation - based pilot certification training is also starting to take on a greater role internationally			0
@entity11 has all the predictions for growth			1
whether its support systems keep pace with demand remains to be seen			0
@entity286 is an award - winning journalist living in @entity23			0
she 's worked as a foreign correspondent based out of both @entity124 and @entity289 .			0

expert says , " if we set up 100 flying schools tomorrow , it would n't be enough . "
as many as half a million new pilots needed globally
@entity11 's airplane fleet expected to triple over next 20 years
mechanics and other qualified ground crew also in short supply
