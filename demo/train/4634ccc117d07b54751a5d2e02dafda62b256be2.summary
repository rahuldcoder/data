@entity1 intelligence agencies fear @entity2 has achieved celebrity as a leaker and could be inspiring others to disclose classified national security information			1
one indication of that may be in new documents published this week by the intercept , the website begun by @entity12 , who published @entity2 's leaks			1
government officials believe the documents , labeled " @entity15 , " came from a @entity18 - run computer network called @entity19 that government agencies used to share classified information			1
investigators are looking for the leak			0
rep. @entity24 , a member of the @entity25 , called it the " copycat phenomenon " and noted it was a big concern			0
" the degree that people have been lionizing @entity2 , it encourages people to make a name for themselves by leaking , " @entity24 told @entity29 in an interview			1
@entity24 said the issue has come up in intelligence briefings that he could n't talk about			0
" it 's a concern we 've discussed : that @entity2 has become the model for other leakers , " he said			1
@entity2 inspired by others @entity2 has said that he was inspired by others who disclosed secrets , including @entity44 , who leaked the @entity45 in 1971			1
he also has said that he considered the former @entity47 private , now called @entity48 , a hero			0
@entity48 leaked hundreds of thousands of classified documents to the anti-secrecy group @entity50 on the wars in @entity52 and @entity53			2
like @entity2 is now by the @entity55 administration , @entity44 was demonized at first by the @entity58 administration			1
decades later @entity44 is widely praised for revealing the government 's secret dealings in @entity61 and neighboring countries			2
@entity2 , who has lived in exile in @entity64 for a year to avoid @entity1 criminal charges , has encouraged others to come forward			1
in the year since his leaks on @entity1 surveillance practices , the @entity55 administration has tried to improve security at the agencies handling the nation 's secrets			1
@entity74 security tightened the @entity74 , where @entity2 worked as a contractor , has tightened its computer security aiming to ensure no one can carry out a theft of the size of which was attributed to @entity2 : 1.7 million documents			1
the director of national intelligence has issued rules across all related agencies to try to better track contact with the media			1
at the same time , the administration is bowing to countervailing pressure to limit how prosecutors pursue leak investigations			0
it is now reining - in aggressive tactics , such as declaring journalists co-conspirators with leakers and subpoenaing journalists to reveal sources			0
the spate of leak scandals stems in part from the government 's move since the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks to more broadly share information			2
some of the 9/11 hijackers were being tracked by one or more federal agencies			2
but the failure to share information across various agencies is one reason why the 9/11 attacks succeeded , officials have said			2
@entity24 said the lesson learned then was to " break down the silos " of information			2
that effort , perhaps went too far			0
" beginning with @entity48 , you see people having access to things they had no reason to access to , " @entity24 said			0
" the pendulum is clearly swinging back in the other direction			0
" millions get clearances a recent @entity125 study concluded the @entity18 approved as many as 3.2 million people for access to secret and higher - level classified information between 2006 and 2011			0
@entity24 said there were far too many people with security clearances			0
at the same time , he said the government 's national security work requires some secrecy			1
revealing the methods by which security agencies try to prevent terror could show terrorists how to evade detection and thereby increase the risk of a disastrous attack			2
intelligence agencies are " kind of damned if they do and damned if they do n't , " he said			0
@entity55 , @entity146 working on changes to @entity74 opinion : @entity74 and your phone records : what should @entity55 do ? review board finds potential abuses in @entity74 phone , internet surveillance			0
