-- the eyes of a child see things differently than an adult			2
it 's an idea that intrigued four young women in college			2
" if you could give a child a camera , they could tell a reality in a way that a foreigner , or even an adult , could not , " co-founder @entity8 says			2
several years later , they turned that idea into a way to help children around the world and founded the nonprofit 100cameras			1
100cameras staff members travel to countries armed with cameras			2
they partner with a local organization serving children in the community			1
for the next few weeks , they teach the children how to take photographs			1
then they set those children free to capture their world and post the photos online			1
for the kids , sharing their life with the rest of the world is a reward in itself , but 100cameras goes one step further			2
the photographs are available for sale , and 100 % of the profits go back to the children 's organizations			1
dramatic pictures show power of photography it 's about " addressing poverty from the inside out , instead of the outside in , " says @entity8 , who is now the company 's public relations director			2
" we partner with a local organization that is on the ground			0
they know the local needs ... and they know the best ways to serve these children and their families			2
" the group 's first mission was to an orphanage in @entity68			1
the photographs were so powerful , they decided to turn their @entity71 apartment into an art gallery , moving furniture into bedrooms , and invited anyone they knew			1
" from there we said we have to do more , and that 's been our mindset ever since			0
we always just need to do more			0
view our photo galleries on @entity82 since that 2008 trip to @entity68 , they have brought their cameras to @entity86 and taught kids in @entity71			1
in october , they are making the journey to @entity90			1
what was once a side project for a group of friends now has almost 20 members and recently hired its first full - time employee			0
photographs from these trips have brought thousands of dollars to the children 's organizations			1
@entity8 says they have a lot of freedom as a small group to address each community 's needs individually			0
" that 's the great part of our model			0
we get to have the conversation with the organization and ask , ' what do you need ? ' " in @entity68 it was lifelines , like food and medicine			1
in @entity71 it was educational needs , after - school learning and computers			1
@entity86 's greatest need was humanitarian aid like food and medicine , but the community also needed a center where the children 's parents could be taught business classes			1
more from @entity131 @entity132 raised $ 17,000 for the @entity68 orphanage			1
it was used for critical maintenance to get a truck running that brings in food and medicine			0
the money was also used to build a fence that keeps them protected from violence of rebel forces in the region			0
the staff says they are overjoyed by the fact that these kids are creating their own success			0
@entity8 says , " it 's really exciting for kids there to see these changes and to feel an ownership in that			0
" the goal is to have their cameras stretch around the globe , and for the impact to continue to be both economic and personal			0
" we want as many kids as possible empowered with the idea and concept that their perspective matters			0
to know it 's their work that can create change in their own communities			0
