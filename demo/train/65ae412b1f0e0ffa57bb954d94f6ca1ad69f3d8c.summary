the @entity5 president said the two leaders want to accelerate the world toward a pact to cut greenhouse gases			1

" our aim ... is not a partial accord or a political declaration , " @entity11 said , " but rather an accord that covers all of the issues in the negotiations and one that has immediate operational affect			2
