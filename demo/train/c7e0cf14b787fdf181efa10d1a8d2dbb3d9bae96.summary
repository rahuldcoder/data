-- administrators for the @entity3 team are putting its assets up for sale at auction			1
a lack of funding saw the team miss the final three races of the 2014 season			0
after falling into administration , @entity3 ceased trading on november 7 with around 200 staff losing their jobs			0
the team is still named on the official entry list for the 2015 season , which begins in @entity19 on march 15 , but a new buyer has yet to be found			2
the online auction , organized by administrators @entity23 , is another death knell for the team 's ambitions to re-join the grid			1
a source close to the process said that efforts to find a new buyer are continuing but that there was nothing to prevent next week 's auction going ahead			1
it is understood that an investor was close to finalizing a deal to buy @entity3 on the eve of the season - ending @entity39			2
but the source added it would now take a " last - minute miracle " to find another new buyer and call off the auction			0
the @entity45 team , which entered the sport at the same time as @entity47 in 2010 season , is also in administration and searching for a new injection of funds			0
@entity52 used crowd funding to raise enough cash to race in @entity56 but that is not a realistic funding option for a full season , which costs at least $ 70m			0
meanwhile , the administrators for @entity47 are focused on generating funds through next week 's auction to pay the team 's creditors			2
the live online sale of @entity3 's assets takes place on december 16 and 17 through the auctionhq.com website			1
the plight of the @entity3 team gives motorsport collectors and @entity45 fans a unique chance to get their hands on some amazing pieces of @entity76 kit			1
the star lot is the 2013 race car -- although with a dummy engine , gearbox and steering wheels its new owner wo n't be able to drive home in it			2
a functioning steering wheel from the 2010 car , a collection of exhaust parts , alloy wheels and a gearbox assembly , including suspension arms and brake calipers , are also some of the mechanical goodies up for grabs			1
there is also a chance to buy driver @entity98 's race suit and a collection of team shirts and baseball caps			1
the " @entity102 " sale also includes more mundane items such as the reception desk from the factory 's headquarters in @entity108 , cordless drills and storage shelves			0
a signed photograph of injured racer @entity112 competing at the @entity113 lends a note of poignancy to the auction			0
the @entity117 collected the first ever points for @entity3 this season by finishing ninth at the race around the streets of @entity123 but the 25 - year - old is now battling severe head injuries			0
@entity112 crashed in difficult conditions during october 's @entity127 @entity39 and is now being treated at a @entity117 hospital			0
while the online auction of @entity47 assets presents a chance to buy some very special @entity134 presents for the @entity45 fan in your life , the team will be hoping for some festive good cheer -- and a last - minute buyer .			1

the *defunct* @entity3 team is selling its assets in an online auction
