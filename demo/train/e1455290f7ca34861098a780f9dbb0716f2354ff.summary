@entity0 -- voters have given @entity4 a mandate to cut government and roll back the @entity11 administration 's health care " monstrosity " in the next @entity7 , the incoming @entity2 said wednesday			1
rep. @entity12 , @entity13 , is poised to lead the @entity14 following the @entity4 's massive gains in tuesday 's midterm elections			2
he told reporters that he and president @entity11 have agreed to work together but called the results a vote for " a smaller , less costly , more accountable government			1
" and the administration 's hard - won overhaul of the @entity24 health care system ultimately will be on the block			0
" the @entity24 people are concerned about the government takeover of health care , " @entity12 said			0
" i think it 's important for us to lay the groundwork before we begin to repeal this monstrosity and replace it with common - sense reforms that will bring down the cost of health insurance in @entity24			0
" for his part , @entity11 blamed the anemic economy for the " shellacking " his fellow @entity39 experienced , but he acknowledged that his policies had n't done enough to bring down high unemployment			1
his administration has " stabilized " the economy and spurred private - sector hiring , " but people all across @entity24 are n't feeling that progress , " @entity11 said			1
" i 've got to take direct responsibility for the fact that we have not made as much progress as we need to make , " @entity11 said			1
the president faced reporters a day after voters replaced at least 60 democrats in the @entity14 , handing control of the chamber to the @entity4 for the first time since 2006 , according to @entity1 projections			1
in the @entity59 , @entity39 lost at least six seats but retained control of the chamber , according to the projections based on analysis of exit polling			1
in the latest result , @entity39 incumbent sen. @entity65 of @entity66 defeated @entity69 - backed @entity4 @entity68 , @entity1 projected on wednesday			1
asked about claims by @entity4 , especially @entity69 conservatives , that his policies are taking the country in the wrong direction , @entity11 cited the economy 's reversal from monthly job losses to private sector job growth since he took office as proof that things were improving			1
but he also conceded , in reference to an auto - related campaign analogy , that the argument could be made that " we 're stuck in neutral			0
" @entity11 said he 's looking at " all ideas that are on the table " to boost economic growth after the deepest recession since the 1930s and wo n't dismiss any proposal " because they 're @entity92 or @entity4			1
" at the same time , @entity11 said , it would be a " misreading " of the election results if anyone believed that the @entity24 people want to spend the next two years trying to " relitigate " his administration 's overhaul of health care or other major legislation of his first two years in office			1
republicans throughout the campaign blasted @entity11 's signature health care overhaul , the @entity105 , after voting all but unanimously against it in @entity7			1
@entity11 called the process of passing the bill " an ugly mess " and " something that i regret " but added : " the outcome was a good one			1
" the health care law , parts of which are just taking effect , requires @entity24 to buy health insurance , provides subsidies to bring down the cost of those policies and bars insurers from denying coverage based on gender or pre-existing conditions			2
despite the stated goal of @entity12 and other @entity4 to repeal the health care bill , the @entity39 majority in the @entity59 makes it unlikely that will happen			2
more likely is legislative gridlock on health care and other issues , with the @entity4 - led @entity14 pushing for spending cuts , deregulation and other measures that will die in the @entity39 - controlled @entity59			2
in tuesday 's vote , @entity39 were battered by an economy that is still struggling to create jobs , with unemployment at 9.6 percent , and an energized conservative electorate fueled by the anti-establishment @entity69 movement that emerged in 2009			1
exit polling showed voter dissatisfaction with both parties , as each received a 53 percent unfavorable rating			0
@entity146 , the head of the @entity147 , said republicans were humbled by the opportunity for " a second chance " at power			0
" i heard that all across the country , people saying , you know , ' you guys better not screw this up , because you 're next on the list if you do , ' " @entity146 said			0
@entity11 called both @entity12 and @entity59 minority leader @entity159 , @entity160 , late tuesday to offer his congratulations			1
on wednesday , he called for unity and an " honest and civil debate			0
" " what yesterday also told us is that no one party will be able to dictate where we go from here , that we must find common ground in order to make progress on some uncommonly difficult challenges , " the president said			0
but @entity174 , who led repeated filibusters of @entity11 administration efforts in the @entity59 over the past two years , told reporters that voters were rewarding @entity4 opposition			1
" it seems to me the best strategy for the other side would be to listen to the voters yesterday , " he said			2
" they made a clear statement about what they 'd like to see done			0
if the president comes in our direction , obviously we want to make progress for the country over the next two years			2
" @entity192 , who was @entity193 chief of staff under former president @entity194 , told @entity1 's " @entity198 " that it was @entity11 's responsibility " to take the wake - up call that came yesterday			2
" the rise of the @entity69 movement added a new element to the election cycle , roiling @entity4 races by boosting little - known and inexperienced candidates to victory over mainstream figures in @entity4 primaries across the country			0
" i do n't think there 's any question that if it were not for the @entity69 , the @entity4 margin in the @entity14 would not be as high as it 's going to be , " @entity1 senior political analyst @entity209 said tuesday night			2
" they gave a lot of enthusiasm and fuel to the @entity4			0
" @entity69 - backed republicans @entity218 in @entity219 and @entity220 in @entity221 won their @entity59 races , according to the projections , but other candidates backed by the group lost key @entity59 races , including @entity227 to senate majority leader @entity228 in @entity229 , @entity68 to @entity65 in @entity66 and @entity230 to previously unknown @entity92 @entity231 in @entity232			1
@entity4 candidates were strong in governors ' races , with at least 10 gubernatorial seats switching from @entity39 to @entity4 , @entity1 projected			2
often overshadowed during midterm campaigns , governorships can affect national politics by their influence in the redistricting of state electorates			0
conservative candidates also made strong gains in state legislatures			0
the @entity246 estimated that at least 16 state legislative chambers had moved from @entity39 to @entity4 control in tuesday 's voting			0
those changes have the potential to reverberate far beyond the state level			0
by seizing control of legislative chambers in several key states , the @entity4 significantly strengthened its hand heading into what promises to be contentious congressional redistricting process , where legislatures decide how congressional districts are drawn			0
that can mean the difference between an incumbent having an easy path to re-election -- or seeing his or her district drawn out of existence altogether			0
the long and bitter campaign season drew more than $ 3.5 billion in spending , making it the most expensive nonpresidential vote ever , according to the nonpartisan @entity272 , a watchdog group			0
the economy was rated the most important issue by 62 percent of voters , far eclipsing health care reform ( 19 percent ) , immigration ( 8 percent ) and the war in @entity279 ( 7 percent ) , according to the exit polling			2
most voters , 88 percent , rated economic conditions as not good or poor , and 86 percent said they were very worried or somewhat worried about the economy , the exit polling showed			1
high unemployment amid a slow recovery from economic recession has been a dominant issue , with republicans accusing @entity11 and the @entity39 of pushing through expensive policies that have expanded government without solving the problem			1
@entity11 has led democrats in defending his record , saying that steps such as the economic stimulus bill and auto industry bailout were necessary to prevent a depression , while health care reform and @entity301 reform will lay the foundation for sustainable future growth			1
@entity1 's @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 and @entity318 contributed to this report .			0

@entity11 says voters have n't felt benefits of his policies
