-- your bathroom 's becoming a refuge , so why not light it adequately ? when it comes to interior lighting , bathrooms are probably given the least consideration of all the rooms in the house			1
the average client i meet does n't think to invest there -- save it for the living room or kitchen , they say			1
i see a lot of baths with inadequate lighting at the mirror			1
often there 's just a single ceiling fixture that 's supposed to do it all			2
but as the bathroom increasingly becomes a place to relax and recharge , complete with steam shower and spa tub , the lighting requires extra thought			1
and when it 's done right , the payoff is great			2
after all , this is the room where you start and end your day			2
a good lighting plan is a series of layers -- placing ample light where it is needed for showers , shaving , or putting on makeup , for instance , while other light sources enhance the overall mood of the room			1
decoding the layers of light task lighting @entity48 lighting gets top consideration because these fixtures work the hardest to illuminate the head and face for grooming			1
the most common mistake people make is putting recessed ceiling fixtures directly over the mirror			1
these cast shadows on the face , making daily grooming rituals more difficult			2
vertical fixtures or sconces mounted on either side of the mirror are best for casting an even light across the face			1
but given the size and positioning of some vanity mirrors , sidelights can be impractical ( mounting them directly to the mirror is always an option , but at greater planning and cost )			0
only then do i suggest a fixture for over the mirror			0
it should be placed 75 to 80 inches above the floor and , like all vanity lighting , contain at least 150 watts -- ideally spread over a fixture that 's at least 24 inches long so that the light will wash evenly over the hair and face			1
this old house : @entity86 the shower is a secondary area of task lighting			1
in smaller bathrooms , if the stall has a clear glass door , a dedicated fixture may not be necessary			0
otherwise , i recommend a recessed light with a glass lens ( plastic will yellow )			1
similar recessed fixtures work well over a freestanding tub or the toilet			0
@entity102 lighting this " fill - in " light serves as a substitute for natural light			1
it is most often supplied by a central fixture , usually a surface - mounted ceiling light			1
i encourage clients to think more creatively in their choices , suggesting they consider a pendant lamp or chandelier instead			0
another option is " cove lighting " -- rope lights hidden behind a molding dropped several inches below ceiling height -- which adds a soft glow around the perimeter of the room			1
accent lighting a small recessed spotlight directed at a piece of decorative art or a beautiful powder room basin creates another layer of light in the bathroom			1
similarly , a recessed shower fixture can be angled ( most can be tilted up to 35 degrees at installation ) to highlight nice tilework or fixtures and make them sparkle			1
lighting the vanity right to eliminate shadows under the chin , eyes , and cheeks , fixtures should be mounted on either side of the vanity mirror ( or on the mirror 's surface , if it 's large ) , 36 to 40 inches apart			2
the center of each fixture should be roughly at eye level , or about 66 inches above the floor			0
this will guarantee even illumination across the face for grooming			0
this old house : double space , light in the bath other considerations choosing bulbs a crisp white light tends to render skin tones most accurately			2
@entity165 bulbs set the gold standard			0
low - voltage varieties ( with a built - in transformer that converts 120 volts to 12 volts ) are especially compact , and the smaller bulb gives a nice sparkling effect			0
@entity165 bulbs cost a few dollars more than standard incandescents but can last three times as long			0
many feature screw - in bases ; those labeled medium - base ( @entity177 ) are shaped like standard incandescents , so they fit most fixtures			0
the newest compact fluorescent bulbs also offer good color rendering and are up to 10 times more efficient than regular incandescent bulbs			0
this old house : energy - saving bulbs think dimmers these are a lighting designer 's best friend because they grant absolute control over the lighting , and thus the mood , of the room			1
in a very small space like a powder room , dimming the vanity fixtures might even provide all - in - one task , ambient , and accent lighting			2
plus , dimmers conserve energy			0
the total savings depends on how much you dim the bulb , but one dimmed just 10 percent will last twice as long as a bulb at full brightness			0
today 's dimmers work for every kind of light source , though you need to know what to ask for			2
a 120 - volt incandescent or halogen light source will need an incandescent dimmer , while low - voltage and fluorescent fixtures require their own compatible dimmers			2
occasionally , dimmed bulbs will buzz as the filament vibrates			0
switching to a lower - watt bulb ( which has a smaller filament ) should reduce or even eliminate the noise			0
safety first attention to aesthetics in the bathroom does n't diminish the importance of safety			1
electricity and water are still lethal companions , and nowhere do they mingle more closely than in the bathroom			1
always consult a certified electrician before tackling even the simplest lighting project			2
the @entity234 requires all new outlets to have @entity237 , ground - fault circuit interrupters ; the newer ones can be retrofitted to existing outlets			0
even with a @entity241 , freestanding plug - in lamps should never be placed near a sink or tub			0
fixtures that are going to be within a certain distance of the tub or shower ( usually 6 feet , though local codes vary ) must be " wet " or " shower - location " rated			0
do n't confuse this with the less rigorous " damp - location " rating that 's ascribed to most outdoor lighting			1

do n't cut corners providing different types of light a bathroom needs
designers say you need light to perform tasks and lights to create mood
@entity86 lighting should be at least 150 watts
make safety a *priority* -- electricity and water are in close *proximity*
