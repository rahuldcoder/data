@entity0 , @entity1 -- on his knees in the soggy soil , 9 - year - old @entity3 digs deep into the earth , his small gardening rake separating dirt from rocks			1
" look , i found a worm ! " he shrieks			0
towering above is @entity12 , calmly instructing @entity3 and the half - dozen other children working to clear spots for new crops			2
" we can put a squash plant here , and some lettuce over there , " says @entity12 , a director of @entity16 , a community organization that teaches neighborhood kids practical skills that help them put food on the table			1
" the children come here and learn how to farm and how to cultivate their very own organic vegetables			2
then they bring them home to eat			0
it 's a wonderful alternative to sitting in front of the computer , " she says			2
the @entity16 ( seeds to the @entity36 ) farm is located in @entity37 , a poor area in @entity0 ' sprawling urban rust belt , where green spaces are few and far between			0
five years ago , the football - field sized area was overrun with garbage and frequented by criminals , but following a community effort to reclaim it , it now teems with trees , grass and flowers , as well as eggplants , tomatoes , lemons and herbs			1
there 's even a small pond where kids and dogs happily splash around			0
" i really enjoy being here			0
it 's like my happiest place to be			0
the fresh air is great , " says @entity3			0
the @entity16 farm is a part of @entity61 ( @entity62 ) , a nonprofit foundation that works to alleviate malnutrition and starvation in @entity1			1
since 1999 , it has helped build more than 50 small farms , many of them in isolated villages in northern @entity1			1
despite being one of the world 's largest agricultural - producing countries , @entity1 still struggles to feed its people			1
" hunger is one of the gravest problems that @entity1 has right now			1
at least 300,000 @entity1 children are suffering from undernourishment , " says @entity76 , executive director of @entity61			1
nearly 5,000 @entity1 children have been educated about sustainable farming practices through the " @entity62 " program , which has also been endorsed by @entity1 celebrity chef @entity82 , and won various awards for its initiatives			1
typically , the program is introduced first at rural schools , where the crops that students grow are then taken home to eat			0
the long - term objective , coordinators say , is to have the children create vegetable gardens at home with their parents			2
" getting parents to change their eating habits , and encouraging them to provide nutritious food to the kids is sometimes the biggest challenge , " says @entity76			1
following @entity1 's economic collapse in 2001 -- when the country defaulted on $ 100 billion in foreign debt -- poverty , crime and unemployment rates soared			1
the crisis , coupled with @entity1 's lack of philanthropic tradition , led to the creation of @entity112 , a @entity113 charity that functions as a bridge between international donors and a network of 65 transparent @entity117 , like @entity61			1
since 2003 , @entity118 has channeled more than $ 3 million in donations to the country , and coordinated the visits of hundreds of foreign volunteers			0
in january , a group of students from the @entity125 spent two weeks at the @entity16 farm , working directly with children and instructors to clear additional farming land and build adobe huts and bathrooms			2
they also left a sizeable donation			0
" when you work day - in and day - out with these organizations ... and you know their needs and struggles ... to receive donations from abroad , even if it is a small amount , it literally changes the reality of many of these organizations , " says @entity112 's @entity134			2
" witnessing these changes is amazing			0
and that 's why we do what we do			0

community efforts have reclaimed lots filled with garbage into urban gardens
children 's hunger and undernourishment are big problems in @entity1
organizations hope that by teaching children about farming , they can have *access* to nutritious food
