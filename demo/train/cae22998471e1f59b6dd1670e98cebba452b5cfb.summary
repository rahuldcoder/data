-- the @entity2 lawyer who represented a woman kidnapped and raped by seven men said his license to practice has been reinstated			1
a protest appeared in @entity8 in november against the @entity2 sentence			2
lawyer and human rights activist @entity10 told @entity0 's @entity12 that the @entity13 has reinstated his license			1

the seven rapists were sentenced to two to nine years in prison but she also was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for having violated the kingdom 's strict @entity35 law by being alone with an unrelated man			1
