@entity0 , which has long accused @entity2 and @entity3 satellite news networks for fabricating and falsifying events , now has @entity5 in its sights			1
state - run @entity0 media asserted thursday that @entity5 journalists were involved in blowing up an oil pipeline in @entity11 province , collaborating with " saboteurs			1
" the allegations surfaced when @entity0 state tv aired portions of the @entity5 documentary " @entity20 , " about the challenges faced by a @entity5 team while on assignment in @entity11			1
" 72 hours @entity20 " : life and death under @entity0 's onslaught @entity24 , described as a member of the @entity26 in @entity27 , asked on the program : " who is behind the attack ? it is one particular group			1
who is this group ? let ( @entity5 ) answer this question			2
it 's one of two things			0
it is either that they are the perpetrators			0
... but i guarantee to you that they are the accomplices			0
" the anchor talking with @entity24 spoke of " conclusive evidence of the involvement of @entity5 and the @entity27 journalists who were present there in the detonation of the oil pipelines in @entity11			1
" @entity0 's state news agency @entity49 picked up the theme friday , writing that the footage " revealed that the camera operators were @entity5 correspondents who entered @entity0 illegally through the @entity54 borders and seemed to have coordinated with the saboteurs to film a video of the attack and send it to their channel			1
" @entity49 also reported that @entity5 claimed the " @entity0 army was behind the attack to deflect suspicion of any coordination , if not to say involvement , with the terrorist saboteurs			1
" @entity66 , executive vice president and managing director of @entity68 , called the assertions " ridiculous			2
" " we stand firmly behind our excellent reporting on @entity0 , " he said			0
" it is a pity that its citizens did not get to see this important documentary without these ridiculous interventions			0
" among other allegations made on the program , @entity24 asked whether @entity27 media outlets were working with @entity79 , which he linked to the @entity81 resistance			1
" why are they now working with @entity79 ? " he asks			1
" i lived in @entity27 for 16 years , and i know the @entity27 are good people			0
" there have been other unlikely claims by @entity0 state media against what they see as international conspiracies against the regime			2
a state tv anchor said @entity94 , the @entity95 news network , " depended on armed individuals , the terrorists as correspondents			0
" @entity0 networks devote hours every day to projecting the government 's message and discrediting any version of events that differs from the regime 's			0
@entity0 has been cracking down on anti-regime protesters for more than a year , and during that time , @entity0 has blocked unhindered access to international journalists			2
as a result , it is nearly impossible to confirm events there independently			0
the government has consistently blamed the violence in the country on terrorist groups , but activists say the government security forces and their militia allies have instigated attacks against civilians .			0
