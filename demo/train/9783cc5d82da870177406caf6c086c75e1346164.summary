@entity0 -- the unregulated nature of the @entity3 has aided a proliferation of cyber-hate , according to a report the @entity7 released monday			1
the report , @entity9 and hate 2010 , notes that there are about 11,500 hate - affiliated web pages , a 20 percent jump from last year 's study			1
according to the @entity20 , personal blogs as well as mainstream social - networking sites such as @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 are easily flooded with racist and terrorist - related content			1
" the spike is not in traditional web sites in the @entity26 , " said rabbi @entity23 , associate dean of the @entity7			2
" it 's more global and almost all in the social - networking area			1
" @entity29 , director of government affairs for the @entity20 and a co-author of the report , said home - grown terrorism suspects have an active online presence			2
he cited the case of a @entity37 woman who officials say called herself " @entity39			0
" the woman , @entity39 , has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and kill a person in a foreign country			0
she had been on the radar of the @entity20 for the past year , @entity29 said			1
" we ask , ' are they just coming out of the woodwork ? ' and the answer in every single case is the @entity53 link , " @entity23 said			2
although these sites are monitored , the report 's authors said , they have become increasingly alarmed by the " lone wolf " effect , making it difficult for law enforcement to discern which threats are legitimate and which are simply talk			1
for example , the late @entity63 , the 88 - year - old who was charged in the fatal shooting of a security guard at the @entity66 in @entity67 in june , kept a web site called the @entity70			1
on it , he blamed a " @entity73 jury , @entity74 " and " a jew judge " for a six - year prison term he served in the 1980s			0
however , " there 's no equation that says someone who posts a rant ... is going to go on a shooting rampage , " said @entity29 , who has testified in front of @entity79 and the @entity80 on the issue of digital hate			0
perhaps even more chilling are the growing numbers of " how to " web sites in which terror groups routinely post instructional manuals and videos on bombmaking and computer hacking			0
the study also explored e-commerce and how it can be used to market hate			0
in february , an @entity100 merchant offered " an original @entity109 ring , " claiming that it came from his uncle who was posted at the @entity104 concentration camp during @entity105 pulled the web page before a sale was made			0
founded in 1977 , the @entity7 was named after a jew who survived the @entity109 and became famous for his career as a @entity113 hunter .			0
