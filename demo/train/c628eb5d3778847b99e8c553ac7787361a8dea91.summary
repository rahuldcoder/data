it 's for just one congressional seat for about eight months , but tuesday 's special election in @entity3 has taken on huge political significance			1
national republicans are framing tuesday 's special election as a referendum on @entity8			1
but their message -- plus a flood of outside spending by @entity15 focused on the issue of @entity17 -- is drowning out other issues in the race , @entity10 candidate @entity9 says			1
his @entity15 opponent , @entity20 , is n't shying away from the health care debate , touting the law 's benefits and saying she 's open to improvements			1
both parties are looking at this race as a testing ground for their messages going into the midterm elections			1
@entity3 's 13th district is one of a small number of competitive ones , and @entity10 and @entity15 say the tight race here will come down to which campaign gets its supporters out			1
both sides have spent more than $ 11 million on media and direct mail , according to data from the @entity44			0
the bulk of that spending comes from outside groups hoping to shape two very different narratives			0
eight things to watch between now and @entity50 @entity10 groups and @entity9 's campaign have concentrated on tying @entity20 to @entity8 and its rocky rollout and to president @entity54 and @entity56 @entity55 , who have low approval ratings among independent voters			1
@entity9 thinks the health care law is a top issue for voters , but the message he was trying to deliver last week at a senior center focused heavily on local issues			2
" there is a lot more going on here that just @entity8 , " he said			2
@entity9 served as a longtime aide to @entity10 rep. @entity69 , whose death last october after representing the area for more than 40 years prompted the special election			1
at the senior event , @entity9 pointed out his connection to @entity69 and the federal resources the late congressman helped to deliver for the district , saying @entity69 was " nearly a father to me			0
" @entity78 : @entity79 takes the year off but @entity15 are trying to make @entity9 's work as a @entity82 lobbyist after he left @entity69 's staff the driving issue in the campaign , arguing he backed changes to @entity17 that could cut benefits			2
the district has one of the highest concentrations of voters over age 65 in the country			0
talk about changing retirement benefits or any concerns that @entity8 provisions could affect health care coverage resonate strongly with voters here			2
pre-emptive strategy on @entity8 standing next to former @entity3 @entity15 sen. @entity100 at an event with seniors at her campaign office , @entity20 called the current programs " an @entity114 promise " and said , " those programs were put in place for a good reason , and i 'm going to fight to protect the integrity of the @entity17 and @entity111 programs for all of us			2
" @entity20 , who served as @entity3 's chief financial officer and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2010 , recognizes that @entity8 is a major issue			1
she acknowledges that the @entity54 administration 's proposal to cut the popular @entity120 is a major worry among older voters , who she says will make up half of the electorate in the race			2
other @entity15 candidates tend to avoid the o - word , but @entity20 talks about the law 's benefits and argues she wo n't go back to the old system			2
@entity133 : @entity15 ' ought to strengthen up ' and support @entity8 @entity20 's strategy on @entity8 appears to be pre-emptive : she stresses how the health care law will help people but also notes it has some major flaws that need fixing			1
she said she is open to @entity10 - backed plans to change the law 's current requirement that employers provide health insurance to employees who work more than 30 hours a week			1
she also said @entity8 's current requirement that businesses with more than 50 employees offer health insurance is " an arbitrary number " and says she wants to work across party lines to adjust the law to avoid any " unintended consequences , " such as keeping businesses from expanding			1
@entity54 : @entity15 ' sleepy ' during midterms @entity9 reiterates the @entity10 mantra that @entity8 must be repealed altogether			1
because his own campaign has n't raised nearly as much money as @entity20 's , the bulk of the ads and direct mail attacking @entity20 are from the @entity163 and other allies like the @entity114 @entity165 and the @entity166 , which backs @entity10 candidates in @entity169 races			1
although he concedes it 's not likely to happen , @entity9 says he remains committed to getting rid of @entity8 entirely			1
he ticks through his plan to cover younger workers with a small government program and says he wants to make sure those with pre-existing conditions can always obtain insurance			0
some @entity10 worry about repeal - @entity8 strategy he said @entity8 shows " two very different views of government			1
we can talk about specific health care solutions , but it really comes down to a view of government that says we need more government in individual lives			0
we need individual mandates and we need more interference between government and families versus a view of government that says no , we do n't			0
" some @entity10 worry that the bright line the party is drawing about repealing @entity8 is n't the right tactic			1
@entity196 , a resident at the @entity198 senior community who supports @entity9 , told @entity200 he thinks the @entity10 should be talking about improving the law instead of scrapping it entirely			2
" i would certainly think personally if i were in charge of his campaign , i would not have said , ' i 'm out to repeal it ' -- he 's been forced to say that by some of the party higher - ups that control the tea party , which is controlling what @entity10 are saying right now , " @entity196 said			1
@entity20 told @entity200 the concerns about the health care law are lower on the priority list for people in the district			0
she puts it as " fifth " on the list of things voters raise with her at forums , after homeowners ' worries about the skyrocketing costs of flood insurance , veterans issues , and the fear that any plans to start offshore drilling could hurt the tourism industry in this beach community			2
but one @entity20 supporter , @entity232 , who runs a retail shop in @entity234 , told @entity200 she thinks voters and the candidates should be talking about @entity8			2
" i would like the conversation			0
i think there are blatant lies about what is being said about @entity8 and that 's very , very unfortunate , because people should be able to decide with the real information , " @entity232 said			1
@entity244 kicks off first primary of 2014 @entity15 had a head start democrats had the advantage going into the race because they did not have to spend time and money on a primary			0
@entity9 endured a contentious primary in january and did n't have any significant resources going into the general election			0
with no primary opposition , the @entity20 campaign went to work against @entity258 early and stuck with the line of attack that electing him would send someone to @entity82 who wanted to cut @entity17			0
the @entity263 and outside groups have spent millions to drive that message home and link it to @entity9 's lobbying history			0
@entity267 , an outside group that backs @entity15 candidates , has spent close $ 750,000 on one ad that says @entity9 " lobbied for a special interest that wanted to privatize @entity17			0
" @entity9 insists that @entity20 has misrepresented his position on the issue and says he would vote against the @entity169 @entity10 budget authored by @entity275 chairman @entity274 because of the changes it would make to @entity17 and @entity111			2
" they spent a million dollars painting me as an extremist and a million dollars on @entity17 and @entity282 - scare and @entity17 claims that are false , " the @entity10 candidate told @entity200			1
poll : anti-incumbent feelings at all - time high @entity9 reiterates he opposes the proposals to privatize retirement accounts or alter how @entity111 benefits are structured			0
" i think the current reform plans are too aggressive , and i do n't think we should pursue them , " @entity9 said			0
republicans privately acknowledge that @entity20 's ability to start her ads early , combined with the fact that her campaign and the outside groups supporting her are outspending them , has hurt			1
@entity300 , who analyzes @entity169 races for the @entity302 , told @entity200 that " democrats have been more consistent with their message in this race , building a narrative about @entity9 as a lobbyist who operates behind closed doors , and that has clearly helped			0
" district is evenly split this district is split down the political middle -- 37 % of those registered to vote are @entity10 , about 35 % are @entity15 and 28 % are unaffiliated or back a third - party candidate			1
there is a libertarian candidate , @entity316 , competing in the race , and he has participated in the three major debates			0
but it 's unclear what kind of impact he 'll have in drawing votes away from @entity323 or @entity20			0
@entity3 allows absentee voting by mail , and well over half of those who were mailed ballots have returned them			0
in past election cycles , @entity10 have traditionally posted a stronger return rate of absentee ballots , but the @entity334 supervisors office reports that the @entity10 holds about a 4 - point edge over @entity15 sending in their ballots			1
voters here frequently mention their distaste for the gridlock in @entity82 , and supporters of both @entity20 and @entity9 told @entity200 they are n't sure that their candidate will be able to change much			0
@entity343 , a registered independent who backed @entity69 in the past and works as a realtor in @entity234 , told @entity200 she 's voting for @entity20			0
but she 's unsure a new , more junior representative will deliver the same results			0
" i know there are some concerns that no one is going to have ( the ) power that congressman @entity69 had from his tenure and from his longtime experience			0
there was more than just his tenure that allowed him to move funding for projects in this area			0
" if @entity9 wins on tuesday , @entity10 will certainly say retaining this competitive seat is a validation of their plan to make @entity8 the central issue this fall			1
a @entity15 victory could have other candidates across the country adopting @entity20 's approach to discussing health care with a " fix - it " attitude			0
house speaker @entity371 made it clear that even if the @entity15 manage to pick up this seat , his party 's midterm strategy wo n't change			2
asked if a loss in this special election could alter the @entity10 message of repealing @entity8 , @entity371 replied simply , " no. "			1

both parties are testing messages for fall midterms in tuesday 's special election
