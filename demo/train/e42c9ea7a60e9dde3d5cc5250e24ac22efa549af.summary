-- @entity2 's @entity1 received a hostile reception on his return to the @entity5 but had the last laugh sunday by scoring the equalizer in a 1 - 1 draw against his former club @entity9			1
@entity12 's 29 goals this season have fired @entity2 to the @entity15 title , grabbing a hat - trick last monday as they beat @entity17 to clinch their 20th top - flight crown			1
he left @entity9 in a $ 37 million switch to their @entity15 rivals in close season and the ill - feeling surrounding that move was reflected in the chorus of boos from the home fans every time he touched the ball			1
@entity9 afforded @entity2 the traditional guard of honor before the kick off , but once play got underway they showed little respect for the new champions			1
@entity12 's sloppy ball saw @entity9 charge forward and @entity33 took advantage of a marginal call for offside to advance and beat @entity37 in the visiting goal			1
they continued to dominate by playing with a ferocious intensity and with @entity1 on the receiving end of some robust tackling , but the match turned near half - time			2
@entity44 saw his point blank header kept out by @entity46 then a mistake by @entity48 let the @entity50 star free and the defender responded by pulling him down in the penalty area			0
@entity12 got up to coolly convert the penalty and draw @entity2 level			2
" it takes bottle to take a penalty when the crowd are booing , " @entity2 manager @entity55 told @entity56 after the match			0
" we have a great spirit of applauding players when they come back to our club			0
i expected the booing to be honest with you			0
" @entity2 were revitalized and had the better opportunities to claim the full three points in the second half , with @entity72 denied by @entity46 and substitute @entity73 seeing a late effort deflected wide			0
but the subsequent draw was a result neither team would be satisfied with and @entity2 can not now beat @entity79 's all - time record for @entity15 points in a season			1
as @entity9 dropped a point , @entity79 moved above them into third with a 2 - 0 home win over @entity85 earlier sunday			1
@entity86 placed @entity87 , two points behind @entity9 in the battle for the final @entity91 spot , have a game in hand over their @entity95 rivals			0
@entity79 , who have a hectic program of league and @entity101 commitments , showed no signs of tiredness with a comfortable win			2
@entity106 's @entity105 gave them the lead in the 43rd minute after a pass from @entity110 , who grabbed the second in first half stoppage time			0
@entity110 , who is one short of the all - time @entity79 career goal tally by former legend @entity115 , struck home a penalty after @entity118 had fouled @entity119			2
the early kick off saw a 0 - 0 draw between @entity122 and @entity123 at the @entity124 , which saw the basement pair relegated			1
after a match of few chances , both were left nine points behind fourth bottom @entity17 and with no mathematical chance of avoiding the drop			0
@entity17 play @entity133 in a crucial relegation battle monday .			0
