" all members of staff mentioned in the report who will need to give evidence at the commission are likewise put on special administrative leave pending the finalization of the enquiry , or pending receiving a clearance from the commission			0
" this action in no way implies that these individuals were involved in match fixing			2
it is again simply for good governance that this measure is being implemented			0
" the members of staff so affected are : @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			0
" the @entity2 was unavailable to clarify what the @entity7 report might mean for @entity93 football or what action they may take after the inquiry			1

" @entity86 is @entity2 's new chief executive officer			2
interim president @entity110 stressed how all parties involved should be considered innocent until proven guilty			0
" this is a difficult situation for the @entity2 , and for those who have been named in the report			1
we hope that there will be no speculation about their presumed guilt or otherwise			0
" we need to allow the investigation to take place speedily and fairly , so those that are innocent can be separated from those who are not			0
