the report 's release came amid continuing @entity2 signals of a possible military attack on @entity5 in response to the suspected poison gassing , which reportedly killed hundreds of people			2
here are five key points : 1			0
a chemical weapons attack killed more than 1,400 people august 21 the @entity2 government has preliminarily assessed that 1,429 people -- including at least 426 children -- died in the attack			1
the report cites " a large body of independent sources , " including @entity2 intelligence information , accounts from medical personnel , videos , witness accounts and reports from nongovernmental organizations			0
three hospitals in the area received about 3,600 patients with " symptoms consistent with nerve agent exposure in less than three hours ... according to a highly credible international humanitarian organization , " the report said			0
" the reported symptoms were consistent with mass exposure to a nerve agent			0
" what do @entity5 's neighbors think ? the report also cites 100 videos showing bodies " exhibiting physical signs consistent with , but not unique to , nerve agent exposure			0
" some videos show imagery " consistent with death from chemical weapons , and inconsistent with death from small - arms , high - explosive munitions or blister agents , " the report said			2
@entity5 government launched rocket attack on area multiple intelligence streams show that the @entity5 executed a rocket and artillery attack in the affected area shortly before symptoms were reported , the @entity2 report said			1
this includes detection of rocket launches from government - controlled territory about 90 minutes before the first social media report of a chemical attack , the report said			0
' high confidence ' that government behind chemicals the report concludes " with high confidence " that the regime used the munitions to deliver chemical warfare agents			2
some of the points it makes : -- intelligence indicates @entity5 chemical weapons personnel were preparing chemical munitions			2
they " were operating in the @entity9 suburb of ' @entity90 from sunday , august 18 , until early in the morning on wednesday , august 21 , near an area that the regime uses to mix chemical weapons , including sarin			1
" @entity96 : @entity5 is a problem from hell for the @entity2 -- " we intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on august 21 and was concerned with the @entity107 inspectors obtaining evidence			1
" -- " on the afternoon of august 21 , we have intelligence that @entity5 chemical weapons personnel were directed to cease operations			1
at the same time , the regime intensified the artillery barrage targeting many of the neighborhoods where chemical attacks occurred			0
opposition could n't have fabricated this " we assess the @entity5 opposition does not have the capability to fabricate all of the videos , physical symptoms verified by medical personnel and @entity123 , and other information associated with this chemical attack , " the report reads			0
why @entity126 , @entity127 , and @entity128 are standing by @entity5 the report also said that it was highly unlikely that rebels executed the attack			0
it cited , among other things , @entity135 's belief that the rebels have not used chemical weapons and have not carried out a large - scale rocket and artillery attack like the one seen august 21			1
a possible reason why government would have used chemical weapons " the @entity5 regime has initiated an effort to rid the @entity9 suburbs of opposition forces using the area as a base to stage attacks against regime targets in the capital , " the report said			1
" the regime has failed to clear dozens of @entity9 neighborhoods of opposition elements , including neighborhoods targeted on august 21 , despite employing nearly all of its conventional weapons systems			2
" we assess that the regime 's frustration with its inability to secure large portions of @entity9 may have contributed to its decision to use chemical weapons on august 21			1
