@entity0 -- " after the storm of a life lived in the heat of political controversy , there is a great calm			0
" and so it seemed inside @entity9 on wednesday as more than 2,300 guests from 170 countries stilled their quiet chatter and waited , silently , for the coffin of @entity14 to enter			1
those words from the right rev. @entity16 , @entity17 , in many ways summed up the mood within : this was a farewell to a stateswoman and @entity24 's pioneering first female prime minister but also to a very human mother and grandmother now gone to her final rest			1
the domed white marble splendor of @entity9 's , @entity30 's masterpiece , only served to remind those within of how insignificant even the greatest of leaders is in the end			2
rewriting history : how @entity24 might have been without @entity14 the coffin 's solemn arrival was signaled to those waiting inside by the muffled tone of the cathedral clock tolling the hour			1
far from the fierce political debate and fervent protests that raged in @entity14 's life -- and indeed in the nine days since her death -- the coffin was carried quietly in by uniformed members of the armed forces			1
draped in a @entity51 flag and topped with a white flower arrangement , it was placed carefully on a bier directly before the guests of honor at the service , @entity57 and prince @entity58			2
they sat across the aisle from @entity14 's children , @entity62 and @entity63 ; and her grandchildren , @entity65 and @entity66 ; and next to serving prime minister @entity67 and his wife			1
@entity14 : revered and reviled , in death as in life a ceremonial mourning sword lay on a red - covered table before the queen , carried in by the lord mayor of london			2
the royals ' red velvet - covered chairs had been the last to be filled , as steadily the cathedral filled to its capacity			0
those who 'd taken their places in the tight - packed rows of seats behind and to either side included men in formal military uniform , adorned with gold braid and medals , cardinals with their distinctive red caps , women in elaborate black hats and foreign dignitaries , some in dark suits , others in more distinctive traditional dress			1
live blog : funeral of @entity14 @entity99 hair was much in evidence , and men outnumbered women -- as was the case by a much greater margin when @entity14 was in office			2
after all , when she entered @entity107 in 1959 , she made up part of only 4 % who were women			0
from time to time during the ceremony , sunlight poured through the windows of the cathedral to glint off the gold mosaic tiles and gilded carvings below the frescoed dome , lit also by gleaming candelabra			0
there was no sign within the grand cathedral walls of the tight security outside , with crowds of supporters and a few pockets of protesters kept under the watchful gaze of some 4,000 police officers			0
welcoming the congregation , the very rev. @entity128 , dean of @entity129 -- who himself this week evoked the lasting anger and hurt felt by some in @entity24 as a result of @entity14 's policies -- recalled now " her leadership of this nation , her courage , her steadfastness , and her resolve to accomplish what she believed to be right for the common good			1
" giving thanks for the country 's traditions of freedom , democracy and rule of law , he invited those gathered to pray			0
only twice did a quiet murmur of laughter punctuate the solemn calm of the proceedings , when @entity16 recounted anecdotes which gave a more personal sense of @entity14 's dealings with those she met			1
she may not be able to control how she is judged by future generations , but the late prime minister 's hand was behind much of the service that marks the end of her physical presence on @entity167			0
opinion : why @entity24 needs another @entity14 as @entity16 pointed out , at her request this was not a memorial service , filled with eulogies , but a simple funeral that reflected her disciplined @entity176 upbringing as a grocer 's daughter in @entity180			1
he acknowledged the contentious nature of her legacy , saying , " the storm of conflicting opinions centers on the @entity14 who became a symbolic figure -- even an ' ism , ' " but said that lying there , she was " one of us , " subject to human destiny			0
" there is an important place for debating policies and legacy ; for assessing the everyday lives of individuals and communities ... but here and today is neither the time nor the place , " he said			0
" this is a place for ordinary human compassion of the kind that is reconciling			0
it is also the place for simple truths which transcend political debate			1
" @entity14 's granddaughter , @entity66 , gave the first reading , her voice clear and steady despite the gravity of the occasion			1
its theme of righteous struggle , " not against flesh and blood but against principalities , against powers , against the ruler of darkness of this world " was perhaps meant to bring to mind @entity14 's own struggles , first to reach power as a woman in the 1970s and then to exercise it for the good of her country			1
as the @entity17 said , " in a setting like this ... it is easy to forget the immense hurdles she had to climb			0
" @entity67 , who now leads the @entity234 that @entity14 headed from 1975 to 1990 , gave the second short reading from the @entity236			1
the archbishop of @entity238 , @entity237 , rounded off the service with the final blessing			0
the hymns and predominantly @entity243 music , chosen by @entity14 and her family , reflected the tastes of a woman @entity67 described last week as a " patriot prime minister " with a " lion - hearted love " of her country			2
and at the end of the funeral , as the other illustrious guests filed out -- including 11 serving prime ministers , 17 serving foreign ministers and senior clergy from around the world , as well as many @entity24 lawmakers -- the sense was reinforced that this was a farewell to a woman who , like her or loathe her , was truly out of the ordinary			2
indeed , many observers noted that the pomp and ceremony of her funeral procession , with full military honors , was barely distinguishable from the state funeral accorded to a monarch			0
no @entity24 prime minister has been given such a farewell since @entity274 died nearly half a century ago			0
former prime ministers @entity279 , @entity281 and @entity282 , former @entity276 vice president @entity283 , former @entity276 secretary of state @entity284 , @entity286 prime minister @entity285 , former @entity276 house speaker @entity275 and @entity278 prime minister @entity277 were just a few of the familiar faces among the departing guests			0
some 50 of the guests had links to the @entity291 , the disputed territory over which @entity14 led @entity24 to war against @entity294 in 1982			2
after receptions where relatives , dignitaries and former colleagues gathered to discuss their own memories of the politician once known as the " @entity14 , " @entity14 's family accompanied her coffin to a west @entity0 crematorium for a final farewell			1
as @entity16 said , those close to her must sometimes struggle to recognize the woman they know in the " mythological figure " created over decades of life in the public eye			0
but as her daughter , @entity63 , said last week , the tributes paid by foreign and @entity24 leaders on her death prove that , whatever one 's views on her politics , @entity14 's " place in history is assured			1
" @entity67 's verdict , given via @entity324 , was that the funeral was " a fitting tribute to a great prime minister , respected around the world			2

more than 2,300 mourners fill @entity9 for @entity14 's funeral
among them are foreign dignitaries , @entity24 politicians and @entity57
this is " the place for simple truths which transcend political debate , " says @entity17
@entity14 's granddaughter , @entity66 , gives one reading , *pm* @entity67 another
