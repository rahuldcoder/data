as @entity1 touts a high - profile crackdown on corruption , experts say it should look south to @entity4 as an example of a @entity7 territory that has succeeded in cutting out the rot			1
four decades ago , @entity4 was one of the most corrupt cities in the world , according to anti-corruption organization @entity12			1
" i would compare @entity4 [ in the 1970s ] to @entity15 today , " said @entity13 , the group 's senior program coordinator			1
@entity12 has only been publishing its @entity16 since 1995 but , had data on @entity4 been available at the time , @entity13 said it would have rated at a similar levels not only to @entity15 , but @entity20 and @entity21			1
according to its latest @entity16 , all three countries score a lowly 35 out of 100 , on a sliding scale from 0 ( " highly corrupt " ) to 100 ( " very clean			1
" ) @entity4 , meanwhile , earns 77 out of 100 , placing it at number 14 of 176 countries ; meaning it 's perceived as slightly more corrupt than @entity27 ( 13 ) but less corrupt than the @entity28 ( 17 ) and the @entity29 ( 19 )			1
how did @entity4 clean up its act ? @entity31 came to the former @entity28 colony following mass street protests after @entity34 , the then police superintendent , fled the territory while being investigated for alleged corruption			1
the outcry led to the formation of the @entity39 , a government body with wide investigative powers			0
but the changes were n't only aimed at officials			0
" they adopted a three - pronged approach , that means punishment , education and prevention , " @entity13 said			0
the education starts at local kindergartens , where characters created by @entity39 present children with ethical dilemmas and stories where the honest one always wins			0
" we do n't teach them about the laws but we teach them about the values , " said @entity57 , executive director of the @entity58 , an @entity39 division			0
@entity64 ' will never tolerate corruption ' two generations after adopting this approach against skirting the rules , @entity66 says there 's evidence of a major cultural shift in the attitude of the local @entity7 population			1
" we measure the tolerance level of the people to corruption , from a scale of zero to 10			2
zero means total intolerance and 10 means total tolerance			0
for the last decade or so , the average was 0.8 , 0.7 or so , " @entity66 said			0
and this drew @entity66 to the following conclusion : " nowadays in @entity4 , people will never tolerate corruption			1
" she says the lack of tolerance for rule - breaking reinforces ethical behavior , both in private and public spheres , as violators are named and shamed by their peers			0
" very often people would come forward to @entity39 to report corruption , whenever they suspected there was a case			2
that 's a big difference compared with before the @entity39 was set up , " @entity66 said			2
" before the @entity39 there was nobody to think about such a comprehensive way to fight against corruption , " he said			2
when jail is the only remedy for corruption it shows there 's another problem : there 's no real fight against it			1
" punishment means you have committed the misconduct , " @entity13 said			0
" prevention is very important , [ the @entity39 ] talks to different sectors , for example , the banking and the construction sectors			0
" the @entity39 publishes guidelines for business and tries to identify operations with high potential risks			0
the institution also organizes events to talk about these issues and push the prevention agenda in the business and government sectors			0
in that process , employees are told how and to whom to report suspected wrongdoing			0
how corrupt is @entity7 ? the distaste for corruption in @entity4 contrasts with the situation in @entity7 , which ranks just below @entity136 in the @entity16 -- sharing 80th place with @entity138 and @entity139 in the ranking of 176 countries			1
its low placing is unlikely to change anytime soon , @entity13 said			0
" in @entity7 now , most of the corrupt officials would compete to see whoever received more bribes			1
" the traditional giving of cash - filled red envelopes during festivals and special occasions has expanded to encompass paying officials for favors , a practice denounced recently by mainland @entity7 state media			1
nor will @entity7 's recent well publicized conviction of former high - flying politician @entity157 on corruption charges change day - to - day realities , said @entity13 , because stamping out corruption is not simply a legal issue			1
" even today , many of the country 's top leaders think fighting corruption means putting people in jail , " @entity13 said			2
" people in @entity4 would take it as shameful to receive bribes , " said @entity13			2
@entity7 needs " a society - wide change in values , " he added .			2

*40* years ago , corruption was rife in @entity4 , experts say
now it 's considered one of the least corrupt territories in the world
@entity7 , however , rates poorly on the index by @entity12
it 's in 80th place on the @entity16 , near @entity138 and @entity139 and @entity186
