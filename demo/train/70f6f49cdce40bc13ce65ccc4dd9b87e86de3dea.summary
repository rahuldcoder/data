@entity0 -- former @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 said monday it would be an " important step " if @entity5 immediately surrendered its chemical weapons stockpiles to international control			1
" but this can not be another excuse for delay or obstruction			0
and @entity14 has to support the international community 's efforts sincerely or be held to account , " she said			0
a potential @entity19 contender for president in 2016 who left the @entity22 in january , @entity17 received questions and some criticism for not speaking out immediately after chemical weapons were allegedly used by the regime of president @entity27 last month			1
@entity1 poll : most @entity3 against @entity3 strike on @entity5 an aide said last week that she supported @entity32 's decision to seek congressional authorization to punish @entity5 militarily , but she had not publicly weighed in until her appearance at the @entity35 on monday			1
her comments came during an address on wildlife trafficking and followed a meeting with @entity32			2
she adhered to the @entity35 line on @entity14 's proposal earlier in the day that @entity5 relinquish chemical weapons to international control to avert a possible @entity3 military strike , which @entity32 is trying to get @entity45 to approve			1
@entity5 welcomed the proposal , paving the way for a possible diplomatic solution to the crisis that comes amid a two - year civil war in @entity5 that has killed more than 100,000 people , according to @entity53 estimates			2
@entity17 's successor , secretary of state @entity54 , discussed a similar scenario , though the @entity22 stressed that @entity27 could not be trusted to give up his country 's chemical stockpiles			1
and just moments before @entity17 's remarks , @entity35 spokesman @entity58 said the " credible threat " of a @entity3 military attack on @entity5 led to the @entity14 proposal			1
but he said any such plan would require close evaluation and that @entity0 remained " highly skeptical " of the @entity5 regime			2
@entity17 said @entity5 's alleged use of chemical weapons " violates a universal norm at the heart of our global order " and " demands a strong response " from the world led by the @entity3			1
@entity35 of @entity27 ' survives on loyalty , brutality " this world will have to deal with this threat as swiftly and comprehensively as possible , " she said			0
@entity17 did not say whether military action , as proposed by @entity32 , would be the best course			1
but she emphasized she will support the president and argued a " political solution that ends the conflict is in the interested of the @entity3			0
" she reiterated the @entity35 's notion that @entity14 's proposal could have only taken place " in the context of a credible military threat by the @entity3 to keep pressure on the @entity5 government			1
" behind the scenes , @entity17 worked the phones for @entity32 , who is trying to convince @entity45 to go along with his plan for a limited , targeted military response			1
@entity17 , a former senator , called @entity98 sen. @entity97 over the weekend , a source familiar with the call confirmed to @entity1			2
but @entity97 had already made up his mind to vote against military action and announced his decision on saturday			0
the source would not speak on the record because the phone call was private			0
a separate source familiar with the call confirmed @entity17 also called sen. @entity107 , d - @entity108 , over the weekend			2

as @entity32 's top diplomat during his first term , @entity17 was automatically associated with the administration 's response to the @entity5 civil war until she stepped down early this year			1
and she 's faced some criticism for that response as debates over @entity5 heat up in @entity0			0
" had president @entity32 and then - secretary of state @entity2 acted then in support of pro-democracy forces when that rebellion was taking place , we could have removed @entity27 and helped usher in stability for that country , " former @entity3 sen. @entity145 said in a statement last week			0
" but we have a very different situation today			0
after nearly two years , 100,000 people killed , a rebel force comprised of @entity160 and a @entity5 regime in a much stronger position , a military strike would no longer be in our national security interest , " the former @entity157 lawmaker said			2
@entity145 is considered a potential candidate for the @entity167 presidential nomination in 2016			0
before leaving the @entity22 , @entity17 defended her role in the situation			2
" i 've done what was possible to do , " she told reporters			0
