@entity0 -- a @entity0 appeals court thursday overturned terrorism convictions for a @entity5 cleric and his personal assistant , saying they did not receive a fair trial			1
sheik @entity8 and @entity9 , were sentenced in 2005 to 75 and 45 years in prison , respectively , after being convicted of conspiring to provide material support and resources to foreign terrorist organizations			1
they now can have new trials under a different judge			0
the lawyer for @entity8 , @entity18 , said , " i 'm extremely gratified at the court 's decision			2
i believe it is legally and factually correct			0
i hope my client , who is elderly and not in good health , will be given the opportunity to return to his family in @entity5			0
" the three - judge panel was unanimous in its decision , citing evidentiary errors that likely influenced the outcome of the trial			2
the judges found that certain pieces of evidence presented by prosecutors were prejudicial and had the effect of denying @entity8 and @entity9 a fair trial			1
@entity9 and @entity8 were arrested in 2003 in a sting operation that culminated in @entity38			1
the government 's case relied largely on secretly videotaped conversations between the defendants and a pair of undercover @entity45 informants at a @entity47 hotel in 2003			0
one of the informants , @entity48 , testified that @entity49 boasted about giving money , weapons and recruits to @entity54 leader @entity53			1
the charges were brought in the @entity56 because @entity8 allegedly collected terrorist funds at the @entity58 in @entity59			2
now that the appeals court has vacated the convictions , prosecutors have the option of appealing to the @entity65 @entity64 if they feel there is a constitutional issue			2
they can retry the case or move to dismiss			0
@entity69 , who is in his 60s , is incarcerated at the @entity71 in @entity72 , @entity73 , as is @entity9			1
