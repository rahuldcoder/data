-- @entity1 is back , crooning ' @entity3 ' live in his trademark suit and fedora as if he had never left the stage			1
a decade and a half after @entity1 passed away , this unexpected new appearance has been made possible with an optical technology called @entity11			1
based on a victorian - era light projection system called ' @entity13 ' which was developed by two inventors -- @entity15 and @entity16 -- in the 1860s , @entity11 offers a range of spectacular stage effects that , in addition to bringing @entity1 back to life , have been used to reanimate @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity25 , the inventor or @entity11 , explains that when it was first developed in the 19th century , @entity13 was quite straightforward : " the @entity13 system is relatively simple			1
it is a piece of foil in a 45 degree angle and it reflects the image from the floor onto the stage			1
" from the audience 's perspective the light projection can offer all kinds of effects including making realistic @entity39 people appear on stage			1
" @entity25 -- an accomplished electronic engineer with 30 years experience in optics -- advanced the concept of @entity13 with modern video projection and animation techniques that serve to update the old technology			2
@entity25 's main innovation is to replace the glass used in original systems with an invisible polymer foil to offer a more substantial image while also allowing the stage behind to remain visible			1
@entity25 's developments quickly attracted interest from senior figures around the entertainment industry : " i first thought of it 15 years ago and i filed a patent application using foil for a @entity13 system and two weeks later i got phone calls from @entity64 's people			1
they came to my office ( as well as representatives ) from @entity68 and @entity69 ... @entity70 came personally , " @entity25 says			0
even though it has been around since the 90s , @entity11 really came to prominence in 2006 when @entity73 performed alongside the animated @entity75 band @entity74 at the @entity76			2
since then the technology has been used by @entity78 , @entity68 , and @entity79 , as well as performers including @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , and @entity84 , as well as @entity85 and dr @entity86 in their famous performance alongside @entity22 at @entity88 in 2012			0
@entity25 is also working with artists to help create shows that bring together members whose schedules clash : " we got a lot of good response from the artists @entity96 ( and ) @entity82 , " @entity25 says			0
" they 're really pleased with the system because in @entity100 they could n't travel all together , so we had two of the group members virtually on stage and performing together , interacting together with the rest of the group who were real on stage			2
" the system has also been used to simulcast events and performances around the world : " another application is teleconferencing ... you can have one performance on one stage that is live and then you can have a hundred performances at the same time all over the world with the same concert , " says @entity25			0
resurrecting performers of the past comes with a complex of legal , technical and ethical questions , but has nevertheless been proving popular with audiences around the world			0
@entity25 says that his company 's next main project is to help @entity127 bring the work of @entity23 back to life in the ' @entity130 '			2
in an interview with @entity132 in 2007 @entity23 said " music has been my outlet , my gift to all of the lovers in this world			0
through it â € ” my music -- i know i will live forever			0
" with the help of @entity11 , @entity23 may be immortalized in a more literal way than he could ever have imagined			0
