it 's not some miserable dystopic movie scene about class polarization			0
the vertical passenger seat -- or " standing cabin " -- may be the next big cost - cutting move in aviation , according to a new report whose author says the concept could be here within five years			1
" i stumbled across the idea when i was looking ( into ) ways to reduce the flight ticket price , " @entity12 , who authored the report published in the @entity14 , tells @entity15 by email			2
@entity12 , an aerospace engineering professor at the @entity20 , says his motivation is to lower the cost of air travel to a level competitive with buses and trains			2
using the popular @entity28 - 300 as an example , his study calculates that a standing cabin would lead to a 21 % increase in passenger capacity while dropping ticket prices by as much as 44 %			1
" i 'm a frequent flier and most of the times during domestic flights , it feels like the flying time is very short that the aircraft is already descending for landing before you can unfasten your seatbelt after takeoff , " he says			0
" hence the big question came to my mind : in such a short duration of flight time , do we really need to sit down ? " @entity12 quickly discovered that the idea had already been researched -- most notably by @entity51 , @entity53 's @entity52 and @entity55 's @entity54			1
the @entity56 ( pictured top ) , developed by @entity58 and unveiled at an expo in 2010 , is a perching saddle , while @entity54 once flirted with the idea of a " flat - padded backboard " with a seatbelt over the shoulders			1
cost or comfort ? in 2012 , @entity54 ceo @entity66 floated the idea with his characteristic bluntness : " the problem with aviation is that for 50 years it 's been populated by people who think it 's a wondrous sexual experience when it 's really just a bus with wings			1
" however , a spokesperson for @entity54 tells @entity15 that the airline has since abandoned its vertical - passenger plans			1
" we have no plans to trial or introduce standing flights , " says the spokesperson			2
@entity84 's @entity83 voiced caution			0
" there are very stringent requirements for the aircraft and the passenger seat to meet before the aircraft or the configuration is certified to carry passengers , " a spokesperson tells @entity15			1
" this novel standing - room design and the mentioned restraint system are early concepts			1
it may take much time for them to materialize			0
" manufacturers have also expressed doubt about the concept 's feasibility			0
" we do n't believe there are good market opportunities for this idea , " says @entity104 , ceo of @entity105 , one of the world 's major suppliers of commercial airplane passenger seats			1
" from our point of view , passengers will not accept to travel that way			0
even if such a seat would pass certification tests , we would see it as a great sacrifice for passengers in terms of comfort and living space , even for very short flights			0
" fly , do n't ride @entity12 , whose report contains some intriguing designs for vertical seats , thinks the concept still has legs			1
" the idea seemed to be nixed before it was properly analyzed because i could n't find any published study about it , " he says			0
" after some initial study , it appears that this is not a bad idea after all and has some potentials to be highlighted			0
" his study concludes that while savings increase as distances get longer , the concept is best optimized on short - haul flights , with tolerance for standing depending on the age and health of individual passengers			1
" i 've seen people stand on buses and trains before throughout a journey of maybe close to an hour , " says @entity12			0
" so if that 's possible , then standing on an aircraft ( should n't ) be a far - fetched idea			2
" if the option available to reach my destination is either sitting on a bus or train for six to seven hours or standing for an hour and half on an aircraft , i believe there are many people who would opt for the latter if the flight ticket price is reasonably low			2
" @entity12 admits his concept is likely to be greeted with skepticism , not least from aviation safety authorities who would have to sign off on the concept			0
nevertheless , he believes that his vertical seating concept could win approval in five or six years			1
" airlines like to reduce operational costs and given this option , i believe they have a big interest for it as well			0
" the only major challenge is to obtain the approval from the aviation authorities and if the concept has proven to satisfy all necessary requirements in terms of passenger safety , there should n't be much problem for it to become reality			2

new *university* study calculates value of standing - room - only cabins on planes
vertical seats could lead to 21 % increased passenger capacity and 44 % lower ticket prices
airlines such as @entity54 have been *touting* the concept for years
while vertical seat designs have been developed , none have yet been approved for commercial transport
