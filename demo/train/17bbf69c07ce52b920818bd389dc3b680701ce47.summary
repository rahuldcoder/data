-- a @entity2 state board said friday that arson investigators used flawed science but were not negligent in an investigation that led to a controversial 2004 execution			1
the panel also said that investigators did not commit misconduct			1
@entity10 was executed in 2004 , 13 years after a fire killed his three daughters			2
prosecutors argued that @entity10 deliberately set the 1991 blaze -- but three reviews of the evidence by outside experts have found the fire should not have been ruled arson			0
the last of those reports was ordered by the @entity22 , which has been looking into @entity10 's execution since 2008			1
a september 2009 shake - up by @entity2 gov. @entity25 kept that panel from reviewing the report			1
but on friday , the panel declared that investigators were using the science available to them at the time , even though it was flawed			2
the board said it would present its final report for a vote at a meeting in october			0
the @entity22 's chairman is now @entity36 , an @entity37 - area district attorney with a reputation as a staunch supporter of the death penalty			1
@entity36 has pledged to state lawmakers that the @entity10 investigation " absolutely " will continue -- but said the panel needs better rules to guide its work , and could not say when the @entity10 issue would move forward			2
thursday , he told @entity0 that the concerns of @entity10 's supporters are based on " a lot of misinformation			0
" " i think that 's being used very much as a side issue to politicize , through some @entity54 lawyers , the work of the commission , " @entity36 said			0
" the commission has been very clear that the commission is going to address the merits of the @entity10 case			0
" the panel also said friday that a legal opinion that challenged the panel 's jurisdiction in the matter was not the " law " of the commission , state sen. @entity61 said			1
on friday , he said he was " happy " to hear the investigation would continue , but concerned that the investigation was looking for misconduct and negligence in the wrong place			0
" unfortunately , the commission is off - track in terms of what it should be investigating , " he said in a statement			0
" it was painfully apparent that many @entity22 members believe that flawed science was used in the @entity10 conviction , but the @entity22 does not seem interested in looking at the bigger picture : when did the @entity84 start using modern arson science and did the @entity84 commit professional negligence or misconduct when it failed to inform the courts , prosecutors , the @entity90 , and the governor that flawed arson science had been used to convict hundreds of defendants ? " @entity61 , a @entity95 @entity94 , serves as the chairman of the board of @entity98 -- the " @entity54 lawyers " that have supported efforts by @entity10 's stepmother and cousins to clear his name			1
the group advocates for prisoners it says are wrongly convicted , and @entity61 said the commission 's work " is too important to be bogged down in political bickering			0
" " @entity109 need the @entity22 to perform its work in a timely manner , so the public can once again have confidence in forensic evidence and confidence that the truly guilty are behind bars and the innocent are free , " he said			2
but @entity36 said the commission has never decided to apply the logic of the legal opinion to the case on friday 's agenda			1
@entity36 was named the panel 's chairman two days before the @entity22 was to hear from @entity124 , a @entity125 - based fire science expert			1
@entity124 concluded the arson finding at the heart of the @entity10 case " could not be sustained , " either by current standards or those in place at the time			0
the @entity98 requested the investigation after a report it commissioned reached the same conclusion			0
death - penalty opponents say an impartial review of @entity10 's case could lead to the unprecedented admission that the state executed an innocent man			1
@entity25 , who signed off on @entity10 's execution , is up for re-election in november , and his critics have accused him of trying to short - circuit the review			1
@entity25 has said he remains confident of the condemned man 's guilt , and police in the town of @entity151 , where the fire occurred , say other evidence beyond the arson testimony @entity124 criticized supports the prosecution			0
@entity156 , a retired nurse in @entity157 , @entity158 , told @entity0 that spiking the commission 's investigation would be a " blatant miscarriage of justice			0
" " the reasonable people of this country and the state of @entity2 can see through what this is , " she said .			2
