-- @entity1 , which has a history of complying with court requests for users ' data , appears to be drawing a line in the sand			1
the company filed a motion in a @entity11 court on monday to quash a court order that would force it to hand over data pertaining to a user involved with the @entity17 movement , according to a blog post from the @entity19			1
@entity20 , the user in question , is being prosecuted by the @entity23 's office in @entity24 for disorderly conduct during the @entity16 's march across the @entity27 last year			0
the prosecution is asking @entity1 for @entity20 's email address and all his tweets over a three - month period			2
@entity1 , however , countered that the court would need a search warrant to get that information			1
it pointed to a recent @entity35 decision which found that attaching a gps device is considered a search under the @entity38 , which prevents unreasonable searches and seizures			0
" if the @entity38 's warrant requirement applies merely to surveillance of one 's location in public areas for 28 days , it also applies to the @entity23 's effort to force @entity1 to produce over three months worth of a citizen 's substantive communications , regardless of whether the government alleges those communications are public or private , " wrote @entity1 in its motion			1
@entity1 also suggested that @entity20 owns his own tweets and could therefore file a motion to quash on his own , despite the prosecution 's assertion of the opposite			2
the @entity19 is calling @entity1 's move a " big deal			1
" " if internet users can not protect their own constitutional rights , the only hope is that @entity65 companies do so , " wrote @entity60 , senior staff attorney at the @entity19			1
" that is why it is so important to encourage those companies that we all increasingly rely on to do what they can to protect their customers ' free speech and privacy rights			0
" @entity20 , who tweets under the handle @ @entity74 , welcomed the news becoming public			0
" @ @entity74 : oh sweet , it 's public			0
@entity1 motioned to quash my subpoena all on their own , saying that i do retain rights to my content			2
" he also expressed gratitude toward @entity1 for defending his personal information			0
" @entity1 's @entity87 make absolutely clear that its users own their content , " a spokesperson from @entity1 told @entity86			1
" our filing with the court reaffirms our steadfast commitment to defending those rights for our users			0
" earlier this year , @entity1 gave the @entity96 one users ' data			2
another user subpoenaed by law enforcement , @entity101 , told @entity86 that he would be filing his own motion last march			0
@entity101 called @entity1 's recent decision " excellent			1
" " i think that this goes to show that @entity1 realizes what allowing the state to subpoena accounts can do to their credibility to social and political movements , " @entity101 told @entity86 via email			0
" @entity1 has one of the better user policies out there ( they actually notify their users of subpoenas ) , and to see them standing up to fight subpoenas like this is promising			1
" do you think @entity1 should stand up to court orders such as these ? sound off in the comments below			0
