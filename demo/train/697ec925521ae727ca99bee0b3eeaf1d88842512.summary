-- if " @entity1 " is the " @entity2 " of @entity4 movies , then " blended " is his " @entity5			1
" @entity4 and @entity7 unite for a third time , after " @entity13 , " but like an unhappy old married couple staring at the clock , they ran out of fresh and meaningful things to say years ago			1
@entity4 plays a @entity15 employee named @entity16 who lost his wife to cancer and has n't a clue how to raise his three daughters			1
the eldest , for example , is named @entity22 ( @entity23 ) but @entity16 calls her @entity24 â € ” presumably because she 's good at basketball and has @entity27 's 1979 hairstyle			0
' @entity29 ' character posters : the eyes have it @entity7 plays @entity32 , a working single mom with two holy terror sons , one of whom is pulsating with puberty and a pornography obsession			1
@entity16 and @entity32 get set up on a disastrous blind date , and both part ways hoping to never see the other again			0
but before you can say , " hey guys , it 's @entity4			2
i convinced a studio to finance our group vacation to @entity48 as long as we make a movie with oodles of product placement , " both families are thrust together at a luxurious resort that specializes in blended and nontraditional - family vacations			2
how and why ? does it really matter ? once in @entity48 , mutual loathing turns to mutual respect , with @entity32 giving @entity22 a makeover and @entity16 helping @entity32 's boys with sports			0
when @entity32 discovers @entity16 's sensitive soul , and @entity16 sees @entity32 in a sexy black dress ... well , i do n't want to ruin the ending for you ! ' @entity65 ' : the secrets behind the roar " blended " is dotted with familiar faces from previous @entity4 comedies and a few hammy celebrity cameos , but only @entity71 -- who plays a middle - aged dad enamored with his buxom new bimbo -- delivers any solid laughs			1
( poor @entity75 did n't even get to visit @entity48 for the lackluster assignment of playing @entity32 's douche - y ex , whose one - line character description must 've been , " @entity80 in ' @entity81			0
' " ) though he 's starring in promising upcoming films from directors @entity83 and @entity85 , @entity4 still seems shackled with the golden handcuffs of making easy , lucrative comedies , from " click " to " @entity88 " to " @entity89			2
" in " blended , " his comic flab has never felt as thick , and this hackneyed " family - friendly " entertainment feels less like a movie than a bad sitcom re-run			1

@entity4 and @entity7 *reunite* in " blended "
but they ran out of fresh things to say years ago
" @entity108 " is more of a bad sitcom re-run than a comedy
