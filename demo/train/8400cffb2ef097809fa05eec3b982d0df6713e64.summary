-- when @entity2 started smelling fish and chips , she knew something was wrong			1
the unmistakable aroma of the classic @entity8 pub food , deep - fried fish and french fries , could only mean one thing : she must be hallucinating			1
after all , there are no pubs in the middle of @entity15			1
the @entity8 explorer was skiing solo across the great frozen continent and had not seen another human being for weeks			1
" it drove me insane , " said @entity20			1
" it was like i was skiing along a huge row of fish and chips shops , the whole day			2

despite being a seasoned explorer -- she previously led a team to the @entity38 ; raced across @entity39 and traversed the inland ice of @entity41 -- this was her first solo expedition			1
she says she has never felt so alone			2
" the first time it really struck me was when the plane dropped me off ( at ) the beginning of my journey , and i watched it disappearing into a dark blob ( in ) the sky			2
" as she started putting up her tent and organizing her equipment , she says she realized her heart was jumping , she was out of breath and her hands were shaking			2

" and it was n't because @entity60 ( was ) scared of dying or injury , it was just that level of aloneness that was instantly frightening			2
just the weight of the amount of time on my own			2
" being alone in the @entity15 means being on a high alert all the time			1
there is a danger at every step : crevasse fields ; whiteouts ; sharp - edged grooves and ridges ; temperatures below -40 c and hurricane - speed winds			1
among the many physical impacts this environment has on the body -- exhaustion , malnutrition , frostbite , cramps , sunburn -- one of the most serious is hypothermia			0
among polar explorers , hypothermia is known as " the silent killer " because its first symptom is a progressive inability to think clearly , recognize the problem and do something about it			0
" the first warning signal of hypothermia is abnormal behavior -- being very quiet , confused , incoherent , " @entity20 explained			1
these are things that other members of an expedition pick up on , but , in a team of one , there 's no one else to raise the red flag			1

" i had to always make sure that i would be able to put up a tent and look after myself at the end of each day			0
" that 's why she constantly wiggled her fingers , to make sure they were n't becoming numb , as the inability to use her hands would have been fatal			0
despite the endless physical dangers , @entity20 says the real challenge is winning the mental battle with solitude			1
" it became the biggest struggle of the whole trip , " she said			1
" every single morning , the first thing that struck me was , ' oh my goodness , i ca n't do this , i do n't want to be here , i 've made a terrible mistake			0
' " i realized that the real ( trick ) of this would not be how strong i was or how much experience i had , it would literally be getting out of that tent			0
" but each day , she would get out of the tent and repeat exactly the same routine			0
after 40 days , she says she started noticing changes			0

my head was completely empty , " she said			0
hallucinations and strange sensations came next : " the sun became really important to me , " she added			2
during the polar summer , the sun circles in the sky , never going down			0
it became @entity20 's constant companion and she began greeting it in the morning			1
" this developed into me having full - blown conversations with the sun in my mind , " she added			2
crying also became part of the daily routine and she says it was n't until day 15 of her journey that she managed to go a whole day without bursting into tears			0
in pictures : stunning undersea panoramas now on @entity166 as an experienced explorer , she knows they are part of the experience			2
" the men do as much crying as the women do , " she said			0
" and the women smell as bad after six weeks without shower			0
" while bodily functions do n't make the difference , it 's the attitude that sets man and women apart			0
she says that even the most experienced women tend to suffer from a lack of self confidence and sense of vulnerability			0
" when i take a groups of women out into the cold environment , they are a lot more unsure , their default position is ' i ca n't do this , ' " she said			0
her job then becomes to convince them about the opposite			0
with men , it 's different			0
" usually they 'll fling themselves at it and their default position is ' i already know how to do this , i know exactly how to do this , ' and it 's a matter of bringing them in and telling them that they need to think more and watch out for certain things			0
" after days of skiing alone , in extreme cold , these differences disappear and men and women have to deal with the same issues			2
apart from one , which @entity20 has yet to find a solution to : going to the toilet			1
during the coldest days in @entity15 , she was deliberately dehydrating herself to avoid the need to get undressed in the bitter frost			1
" it 's the only time in my life i 've ever ... wanted to be a man , " @entity20 said			1
" you see the guys just turn around and have a quick pee in the snow and you go , ' @entity220 , i have to get undressed in this cold ! ' "			0
