-- the @entity2 administration is launching a big new offensive : combating sexual assault on college campuses			1
on friday , the @entity6 launched " it 's on @entity8 , " a campaign aimed at tackling the problem plaguing universities across the country			1
the movement , developed from recommendations issued by a @entity6 - ordered task force in april , will seek to raise awareness and educate college students about the issue and what can be done to prevent it			1
a top priority " it 's on @entity8 " is a next step in a series taken by the @entity2 administration to address the problem of sexual assault at colleges			1
in april , the task force released a 20 - page report that highlighted what it described as the four most pressing problems in this area : identifying the problem on campuses ; engaging men in prevention measures ; effectively responding to assault where it 's reported ; and increasing transparency in the federal government 's effort to enforce laws and respond to sexual assault cases			1
the new campaign will focus on tackling those issues by expanding student - led efforts at individual colleges and partnering with associations including the @entity50 and athletic conferences such as the @entity52 , and large companies , including @entity54 , which will promote the campaign on @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			1
over 200 colleges have signed on to participate in the campaign , including @entity61 , the @entity62 and @entity63			2
" this is on all of us , every one of us , to fight campus sexual assault , " president @entity2 said friday			1
" we are going to organize campus by campus , city by city , state by state ; this entire country is going to make sure that we understand what this is about and that we 're going to put a stop to it			2
" senior administration officials told reporters in a conference call ahead of friday 's unveiling that ending sexual assault has been a top priority throughout @entity2 's presidency			1
" since the very beginning of the administration , the president and vice president have made it a top priority to end sexual assault			1
today , one in five women is sexually assaulted while in college , " senior @entity2 officials told reporters on a conference call			1
" most often , it happens to her during ( the victim 's ) freshman or sophomore year by someone she knows			0
and also most often , she does n't report what happened			0
" the one - in - five statistic is often cited by the @entity6 when discussing this issue			1
it is derived from two studies conducted in 2007 and 2009			0
many sexual assault instances go unreported , so it is difficult to get a complete count of instances			1
reference to the @entity114 scandal though neither @entity2 nor vice president @entity116 mentioned recent revelations of domestic abuse by several @entity114 players , both made allusions , with @entity2 calling on athletic associations , among others , to step up their efforts and set a better example			2
@entity116 said that the campaign will be a success when every man understands that domestic violence is never acceptable			2
" as far as we 've come , the fact is that from sports leagues , to pop culture , to politics , our society still does not sufficiently value women			2
we still do n't condemn sexual assault as loudly as we should			1
we look the other way , " @entity2 said			0
" the mark of success will be that not a single woman in @entity8 blames herself and when every man in @entity8 understands ... there is no circumstance at all under , other than self - defense , when he has the right to raise a hand to a woman			0
zero , " @entity116 said			0
@entity2 administration officials did n't say whether the president or vice president would address the @entity114 scandals at the campaign 's launch			2
they stressed that the focus of the movement was " primarily on college students as opposed to professional athletes " but said the @entity114 needs to " get a handle " on the problem and adopt a " zero tolerance " policy , since younger players tend to look up to professional athletes			2
" the nexus to our campaign is an important one , too , in that many of these professional athletes are marketed as role models to young people , " one official said			0
" so their behavior does have the potential to influence these young people			0
" " so that 's one of the many reasons it 's important the league gets a handle on this and have zero tolerance : because many , many young people who are playing sports in high school or in colleges are looking up to these men as role models			0
and that behavior is not something we 'd want them to replicate			0
" engaging men a key component of " it 's on @entity8 " will be to engage college - age men in the prevention process , @entity6 officials told reporters			1
" while we 're going to seek to raise awareness with everyone and encourage everyone to get involved , there 's also going to be a special focus on reaching and engaging men , " a senior administration official said			0
that is " based on the social norms research that tells us that young men often overestimate other men 's acceptance of violence			0
" " most men in fact are not comfortable with violence against women , but they do n't speak out because they believe that other men accept this behavior			2
by getting men involved , we think we can interrupt that way of thinking , " they said			0
@entity116 made a blunt appeal to men in his remarks friday			0
" so to the guys out there who are watching this on television : step up , " he said			0
officials stressed , though , that above all else , the campaign aims to be " inclusive , " reaching everyone on a college campus , from students to faculty to top administrators			1
bringing in the celebrities in addition to partnering with universities , associations , private companies and others , the administration launched a website and an anti-sexual assault public service announcement featuring @entity2 and @entity116 , plus several celebrities , including @entity250 , @entity251 and @entity252 .			0
