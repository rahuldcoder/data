@entity0 -- now that the company has a phone , @entity2 can finally answer opportunity 's calls			1
the @entity9 tech company 's latest revival efforts are partly hinged on selling customers every type of gadget , all seamlessly integrated			2
but without a cellular phone division to call its own until recently , @entity2 was missing the one electronics product that people tend to carry with them most often			2
now , a newly acquired division called @entity17 is tasked with building smartphones that align with its parent company 's strategies and plays well with other types of @entity2 gadgets			1
phones are not only central to how people stay connected			0
they can also link disparate devices together , by synchronizing over the @entity28 or acting as a remote control			0
@entity2 's @entity32 and @entity33 services , which offer streaming music and video downloads , are expected to find their way into every @entity28 - connected gizmo @entity2 makes , executives said			1
the @entity38 will let users play the same games on their phones and tablets , they said			0
all of these services will be part of @entity45 , and users will only need to remember one login name and password			0
@entity17 developers are working on a feature that will let people flick a video on their @entity2 phone 's screen to be played instantly on a @entity2 television set , @entity17 head @entity49 said in an interview			1
this ability is already built into @entity2 's @entity59 , which , like @entity2 's phones , runs @entity63 's @entity62 operating system			1
' the same elements ' as @entity65 @entity2 engineers companywide will be required to work with the new @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity2 's executive deputy president , said at a meeting with reporters last week			1
( @entity71 is an abbreviation for " user experience , " meaning how people interact with the products			0
) @entity17 contributed some engineers to the group , @entity49 said			2
" i think this is crucial , " he said of the integration group			0
the new committee appears to strive for the way @entity65 runs its businesses			0
it 's not unusual for @entity65 engineers to work on phone software and then shift to the tablet and then to the @entity88 @entity87 , the late @entity65 co-founder , described his company as the world 's largest start - up			1
" we have the same elements that @entity87 ( @entity96 ) was talking about , " @entity2 ceo @entity92 said at the meeting with @entity68 and reporters last week			2
" we have far more products than anyone else			0
" the new @entity2 initiative that prompted the company to purchase a phone manufacturer is called " the four - screen strategy			1
" ( @entity2 also has a " lens to the living room " strategy , which describes its offerings of video production and consumption tools			1
@entity2 apparently likes for its corporate policies to have cute names			2
) the four pillars of @entity2 's attack plan are computers , tablets , televisions and phones			1
@entity2 has had the first three			2
the @entity9 company entered the tablet market in september , around the time when many other electronics piled in with hopes to challenge @entity65 's @entity124			0
the decline of @entity17 @entity2 's status in phones was complicated			1
it had a joint venture with @entity17 that had been slowly sinking since the @entity130 launched in 2007 and reconfigured the concept of a smartphone			1
last year , @entity17 was finally able to build some buzz , especially in the @entity134 , where its market share is practically nonexistent			1
the @entity136 was the first @entity137 phone , which had a slide - out controller and let players download classic console games			0
the @entity136 did n't turn out to have the impact it promised , and it was n't a huge hit , despite being available on the two largest @entity134 carriers , @entity143 and @entity144			0
when asked about @entity17 last week , @entity145 , @entity146 network operations president , said , " i would n't consider them a major hardware company			2
" the key opportunity for @entity2 was when the mobile venture posted yet another dismal financial quarter in october , and @entity17 was finally ready to sell			1
less than two weeks later , @entity2 announced that it was purchasing @entity17 's share in the company			1
@entity17 is not the only cell phone manufacturer to get scooped up by a technology giant last year			1
@entity63 announced plans to acquire @entity158 for $ 12.5 billion in august			0
but it was unusual for an electronics @entity160 such as @entity2 not to be fully invested in the mobile industry			2
and it was perhaps unrealistic for @entity17 to try to float at arm 's length from its parents			2
without being a part of a larger entity , the joint venture had little hope , said @entity49 , the @entity17 head			1
" my view since i joined 2 1/2 years ago is that it 's always been a @entity2 company , " @entity49 said			2
" it 's very hard , i think , to survive as a mobile hardware - only company			2
" ' @entity134 - first strategy ' after the adoption , @entity17 is focusing its efforts on the @entity134			1
in other words , it has instituted a " @entity134 - first strategy , " @entity49 said			0
" the @entity134 has taken back the lead in the mobile industry , " he said , citing deployment of fourth - generation network technology			0
" it 's the first @entity187 country			0
" @entity2 announced last week at the @entity188 that the @entity189 will debut first in the @entity134			0
@entity144 ceo @entity190 showed the product at his news conference			0
relations between the carrier and @entity2 have improved greatly , @entity144 executive @entity193 said in an interview			0
" they 're making it easier to do business with @entity2 , " @entity193 said			0
however , @entity144 spent more time at the @entity188 event talking about competitors ' phones , and @entity190 practically hugged @entity203 ceo @entity202 , who was there to promote @entity206 phones			0
the @entity189 will be @entity2 's flagship phone for the time being , but it is still a @entity17 product , @entity49 said , even though it does n't have @entity17 's name on it			1
the first true @entity2 phone is expected to debut later this year , he said			1
" next year , i 'll be up there hugging @entity190 , " @entity49 said with a laugh .			0

@entity2 bought @entity17 's stake in their joint venture last year
@entity2 plans to integrate phones into its " four - screen strategy "
all @entity2 devices are expected to work seamlessly together
