-- when @entity2 think of " five star " hotels , they conjure up images of on - site spas , white - gloved service , and pillow menus			2
that 's no surprise , given that the dominant rating systems in the @entity2 are two of the most trust - worthy on the planet -- @entity13 and @entity14			1
in order to snag @entity13 's highest ratings , for example , a hotel 's staff must meet criteria such as greeting arriving guests curbside within 60 seconds and offering tasting samples to drinkers ordering wine by the glass			1
in @entity32 , on the other hand , where the rating system is government owned and operated , all it takes to score five stars is a 24 - hour reception desk , receptionists that speak three foreign languages , and double rooms starting at 172 square feet			1
@entity38 : 10 gorgeous pools you wo n't believe are public there are more scoring systems than most folks realize , and they vary from country to country ( and , in some cases , from city to city )			1
that said , most ratings fall into one of four main categories : those operated by private companies such as @entity14 , those run by hotel booking sites such as @entity57 , user - generated systems , and government - run agencies			1
bottom line : consistency is an issue			0
in the past two years , several governments including @entity65 's and @entity66 's have overhauled their systems to be more uniform , and @entity68 is following suit this year			2
@entity72 , in 2009 , @entity71 's @entity70 launched with the goal of establishing common classification criteria across the @entity75			2
despite the improvements , figuring out which hotel will provide the best value can still feel like cracking the @entity79			2
to help you make the most informed decision possible , we scrutinized criteria across the globe to suss out the meaning behind the stars			2
no matter where you 're going , here is what you need to know before you book			0
no. 1 : private - company rating systems verdict : independent ownership , consistent criteria , and anonymous inspectors make companies like @entity14 and @entity13 ( formerly @entity96 ) @entity95 reliable and unbiased			1
both @entity14 and @entity13 have been rating hotels for more than half a century and provide regular , in - depth reports on what consumers can expect , from how many soaps in the bathroom to bedsheet thread counts			1
every 12 to 18 months , for example , @entity13 inspectors make incognito visits to up to 5,000 properties and complete a checklist of 525 questions : are guests arriving in a taxi greeted curbside within 60 seconds ? does wine - by - the - glass service include a tasting sample ? findings are relayed in a 110 - page report			1
five - star spots feature virtually flawless service -- if you only eat the cantaloupe off the breakfast - buffet fruit tray , for example , expect extra melon delivered to your table			0
diamonds are the currency in the @entity14 system , where inspectors pay unannounced visits to 32,000 @entity131 properties annually and rank them on a scale from one diamond ( lowest ) to five			1
but even single - diamond hotels have standards : in order to be @entity14 - rated , properties must adhere to a basic set of benchmarks relating to cleanliness and management ( bathrooms must have mini soaps , for example ) , but do n't expect a business center or even an elevator			1
on the other hand , in five - diamond hotels you can bank on a full on - site spa , 24/7 room service , choice of pillow filling ( pick from goose down , silk , cashmere ) , even a personal butler			0
outside of the @entity2 , @entity157 is one of the few other countries in the world with a private rating system , which also happens to be called @entity14			1
the system is operated by the @entity162 , an organization similar to ( but not affiliated with ) @entity131 's @entity14			2
no. 2 : hotel booking sites verdict : online booking engines such as @entity57 use a combination of hired scouts and user ratings to review hotels , but generally reviewers are n't anonymous and the standards vary by country and company			1
these ratings are best used in conjunction with other review sites			0
@entity177 and @entity178 each has its own rating system , though neither publishes their ratings criteria on their website			2
the standards vary by company and country -- which means a hotel in @entity187 wo n't necessarily be rated by the same criteria as one in @entity190			1
( one major reason is the difference in room size between @entity71 and @entity131 ; rooms tend to be smaller overseas , even in hotels that would otherwise score high marks			0
) @entity57 , for example , stations employees on every continent but @entity200 to suss out properties			0
while these scouts are n't anonymous -- they actually work with hoteliers to improve hotels ' star ratings -- 2 million unvetted consumer reviews provide another layer of feedback			2
ratings are based on location , amenities , type of accommodation , and service			0
@entity38 : secret hotels of @entity216 no. 3 : user - generated rating systems verdict : user ratings are more valuable en masse			1
the key is to focus on what the majority of reports seem to indicate about a property and to ignore extremely positive or negative reviews , which may be biased			0
use these sites as a reference but not your sole reference			0
user - generated sites are built on feedback from the masses : @entity233 , for example , features more than 50 million traveler reviews sounding off on nearly 495,000 hotels worldwide			1
while the company , which launched in 2000 , bills itself as having " @entity238 's most trusted travel advice , " the sheer volume of sources -- and @entity233 's inability to vet them all for accuracy -- make these reviews something to take with a grain of salt			2
( a general rule is to ignore the ecstatically positive and totally negative reviews in favor of those in the middle			1
) while the site has stringent guidelines ( " reviews should contain only original content and no quoted material from other sources ... we do not allow quoted material from personal email correspondence with a property manager " ) and even has moderators to flag posts that seem fishy ( like a hotelier giving his property rave reviews , for example ) , there 's no way to catch every questionable review			0
even with the caveat , peer reviews can be helpful , as they 're often more detailed ( " the room smelled of moldy hotel carpeting " ) and straightforward ( " the check - in staff was great , but the hotel was on a yucky street " ) than those from third - party organizations or tourism boards			1
no. 4 : government - run ratings systems verdict : government - run ratings systems may be self - interested -- the better a destination 's hotels , the more tourists it 'll draw -- and unregulated by a third party			2
proceed with caution , and always refer to at least one or two other sources			0
most @entity71 countries have their own government - produced ratings , as well as countries in @entity290 , @entity291 , and @entity292			0
( there 's no standardized system across @entity71 , but in 2009 , an organization called the @entity70 launched a drive to establish a common system across the @entity75			0
so far , 11 countries , including @entity294 , @entity66 , and @entity65 , are participating			0
) in @entity71 , reliability varies by country -- the @entity303 's system is uniform across @entity304 and fairly trustworthy , though tourist authorities have toyed with the idea of including user reviews			1
in @entity310 , on the other hand , ratings are n't based on quality but on the presence of certain features ( air - conditioning and bathroom facilities , for example )			0
in @entity32 , a hotel can earn a single star just for changing the sheets on the beds once a week ( do n't let the bedbugs bite ! )			0
also low on the reliability scale : @entity290 , @entity291 , and @entity292 , where national tourism boards have no standardized criteria or oversight			0

hotel scoring systems vary from country to country
consistent criteria and anonymous inspectors make @entity14 and @entity13 reliable
favor middle - ground reviews on user - generated rating websites
