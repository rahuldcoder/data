-- last week , i had the honor to visit the @entity4 tent on the national mall			2
the fasters welcomed me with open arms and a smile despite their struggle			2
the tent was full of messages of encouragement , expressions of admiration and symbols that remind every visitor of the reason for the fasters ' sacrifice : the rights of immigrants and a @entity20 vote on the @entity22 immigration bill			1
volunteers explained the meaning behind each symbol : a shoe they found abandoned in the desert represents the immigrants who lost their lives in search of a better life in the @entity34 ; the bottle of cough syrup that has a $ 75 price tag attached to it represents the many abuses -- physical and economic -- that immigrants suffer trying to come to this country			2
several courageous fasters recalled their stories			1
their strength , passion and commitment was clear			0
one story in particular hit close to home			0
@entity49 , an undocumented mother from @entity50 who fasted for several days , explained that she constantly worries about being separated from her young children and not being able to see them again			0
as a mother , i ca n't imagine not being with my kids and not seeing them grow			0
seeing @entity57 's pain and the fear in her eyes , and the love and sadness in her voice as she asked me in tears : " tell speaker @entity67 to give us a vote , " overcame me with emotion			1
fighting injustice is not a hobby			0
it 's a way of life that requires commitment and unrelenting focus			2
the fasters embody this way of life and they represent millions of people who are struggling to keep their families together and be treated with dignity			1
the struggle of the immigrant community is our collective struggle			0
this is a humanitarian crisis that must be solved			0
some have ended their fasts , some recently started			0
i intend to fight side by side with the fasters , every step of the way until the end , and encourage my @entity97 colleagues to consider the incredible sacrifice that these men and women have made for the immigrant community , and talk to the many families who are most affected by the @entity97 obstructionism			2
house speaker @entity67 should make it a priority to do what 's right for the 11 million undocumented people living in the @entity34 , instead of caving into the @entity97 's extreme party politics			1
my @entity97 colleagues must simply allow a vote and stop standing in the way of immigration reform			1
so , as a mother and a lawmaker , i stand with the fasters calling on @entity67 to lead , and help pass immigration reform			1
i challenge him to live up to the @entity34 people 's expectations and to honor their wishes -- to stop listening to those in the @entity97 who oppose immigration reform and to do what is right			1
this is not a political issue , it 's a human issue and delaying a vote is immoral			1
the fasters ' silent sacrifice is sending a very loud and clear message , and their actions are inspiring thousands across the country -- including members of @entity133 -- to join them in fast			0
their efforts wo n't be in vain			0
we will get this done			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity140 .			1
