-- in april 2009 , the @entity1 released a presidential memorandum declaring that democracy and human rights in @entity5 were " national interests of the @entity7			1
" assistant secretary of state @entity8 repeated the message in may of this year to the @entity10 in @entity11			0
the @entity13 administration , he said , wanted " to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ... in ways that will empower the @entity5 people and advance our national interests			1
but if the administration really wanted to do something in the national interest , it would end the 50 - year - old policy of political and economic isolation of @entity5			1
the @entity5 embargo can no longer even pretend to be plausible			1
on the contrary , it has contributed to the very conditions that stifle democracy and human rights there			0
for 50 years , its brunt has fallen mainly on the @entity5 people			2
this is not by accident			0
on the contrary , the embargo was designed to impose suffering and hunger on @entity5 in the hope that they would rise up and overturn their government			1
" the only foreseeable means of alienating internal support , " the @entity44 insisted as early as april 1960 , " is through disenchantment and disaffection based on economic dissatisfaction and hardship			0
" the @entity7 tightened the screws in the @entity52 years with the @entity53 and the @entity54 -- measures designed , sen. @entity56 said , " to wreak havoc on that island			2
" the post-soviet years were indeed calamitous			0
throughout the 1990s , @entity5 faced growing scarcities , deteriorating services and increased rationing			2
meeting the needs of ordinary life took extraordinary effort			0
and therein lies the problem that still bedevils @entity7 policy today			1
far from inspiring the @entity5 people to revolution , the embargo keeps them down and distracted			1
dire need and urgent want are hardly optimum circumstances for a people to contemplate the benefits of democracy			0
a people preoccupied with survival have little interest or inclination to bestir themselves in behalf of anything else			0
in @entity5 , routine household errands and chores consume overwhelming amounts of time and energy , day after day : hours in lines at the local grocery store or waiting for public transportation			2
@entity5 in vast numbers choose to emigrate			0
others burrow deeper into the black market , struggling to make do and carry on			0
( @entity5 has one of the highest suicide rates in the world ; in 2000 , the latest year for which we have statistics , it was 16.4 per 100,000 people			0
) a june 2008 survey in the @entity103 reported that less than 10 percent of @entity5 identified the lack of political freedom as the island 's main problem			1
as one @entity5 colleague recently suggested to me : " first necessities , later democracy			2
" the @entity7 should consider a change of policy , one that would offer @entity5 relief from the all - consuming ordeal of daily life			1
improved material circumstances would allow @entity5 to turn their attention to other aspirations			0
ending the embargo would also imply respect for the @entity5 people , an acknowledgment that they have the vision and vitality to enact needed reforms , and that transition in @entity5 , whatever form it may take , is wholly a @entity5 affair			2
a good - faith effort to engage @entity5 , moreover , would counter the common perception there that the @entity7 is a threat to its sovereignty			1
it would deny @entity5 leaders the chance to use @entity7 policy as pretext to limit public debate and stifle dissent -- all to the good of democracy and human rights			1
and it would serve the national interest			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity149			0

@entity149 : @entity7 administration has said @entity5 democracy is @entity7 's " national interest "
if president @entity13 wants change in @entity5 , he must lift embargo , he says
while struggling to survive , he says , @entity5 have no energy for political reform
@entity149 : lifting embargo would deny @entity5 leaders @entity7 policy as an *excuse*
