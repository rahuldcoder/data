-- is the three - year - old eurozone sovereign debt crisis nearing its end ? the very fact that such a question is being asked with increasing frequency by investment strategists speaks volumes about the dramatic improvement in market sentiment towards the eurozone of late			1
psychologically speaking , the end of 2012 is a far cry from the dark days of november 2011 when nervousness about the eurozone was at its highest			1
what accounts for this shift in sentiment and is it justified ? @entity19 , the president of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , deserves most , if not all , of the credit			1
by promising in late july to " do whatever it takes " to save the eurozone , @entity19 significantly reduced the threat of @entity27 's single currency area breaking up			2

@entity32 , the focal point for market anxiety for much of this year , is now seeing foreign capital trickle back into its economy after months of outflows			0
the yield on @entity32 benchmark 10 - year bonds , which many investors treat as a proxy for risk in the eurozone as a whole , now stands at just under 5.4 % , sharply down from 7.6 % as recently as july 24			0
as for @entity46 , whose bond market was collapsing late last year and which is gearing up for a crucial parliamentary election that could take place as early as march 10 , investors have never been more sanguine about the country since it got sucked into the eurozone crisis in july 2011			1
@entity46 is now selling 10 - year bonds at pre-crisis yield levels			0
yet what if @entity19 had n't pledged to do what 's necessary to prevent the eurozone from breaking apart ? would @entity32 and , to lesser extent , @entity46 interest rates have fallen so sharply without the promise of bond - buying from the @entity20 ? definitely not			1
the recent improvement in sentiment towards the eurozone stems almost entirely from the actions of one man - @entity19			1

so successful has @entity19 's bond - purchasing pledge been in driving down @entity32 and @entity46 yields that some foreign investors now see @entity46 bonds as an attractive buying opportunity			2
yet if the risks in the eurozone are receding , why are investors still parking most of their money in " safe haven " @entity82 bonds -- and even paying @entity84 for the privilege of lending it money as the negative yields at recent auctions of short - term @entity82 bonds illustrate ? the answer 's clear : investors rightly believe the eurozone crisis is still far from being resolved and could yet flare up again			0
market commentators should stop focusing solely on government bond yields and start paying more attention to @entity27 's deteriorating economic fundamentals and its messy politics			1
there 's a reason why @entity19 had to step in to stem the panic : because eurozone politicians keep dithering instead of putting in place measures to secure the financial and economic stability of @entity27			2
in a nutshell , there 's an enduring standoff between a @entity110 - led group of member states wary of ceding more sovereignty and a @entity82 - led one wary of sharing more risks			0
to make matters worse , @entity82 is even reluctant to share more sovereignty when it comes to allowing the @entity20 to start supervising its banks -- in particular its weaker regional lenders known as the @entity119 - as the first stage in plans to set up a banking union across @entity27			0
it 's the politics of the eurozone crisis which matter most now			0
the big issues in @entity27 -- establishing a banking union , shoring up @entity32 , agreeing on a new seven - year @entity129 budget and , last but by no means least , keeping @entity28 in the eurozone -- are in the hands of politicians , and not of the @entity20			2
so when you hear about how successful @entity32 and @entity46 bond auctions have been of late , bear in mind that bond yields are just one gauge --- and by no means the most important -- of whether the eurozone crisis is nearing its end			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144 .			0

improvement in sentiment is *largely* a result of actions taken by @entity20 head @entity19
market commentators should pay more attention to fundamentals and less to *fluctuating* bond yields
the end of 2012 is a far cry from the dark days of 2011 when nervousness about the eurozone was at its highest
