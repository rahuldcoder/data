@entity0 knew his share of @entity3 fights -- as the @entity6 vice presidential and presidential nominee and as both @entity9 majority and minority leader			1
but as he celebrates his 90th birthday on monday , he told @entity11 he believes the tone in @entity3 is much more bitter -- and that is not helping the country			2
" there were a lot of differences in the days i was in the @entity9 , " he told @entity11 in a rare interview			2
" but in every case we were able to work the out the differences			1
" @entity0 served in the @entity9 alongside several @entity24 leaders who were known for their strong wills : @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28			1
" we disagreed , but we respected each other , " he said			2
" we never had an unkind word about each other			2
" now as @entity0 looks at today 's @entity32 he thinks the two parties are not doing enough to try to find a middle ground -- and that includes relying too much on the filibuster in the @entity9			1
" it is very frustrating			0
sometimes it is just justified , do n't misunderstand me			0
but most of the time you ought to be able to work out a compromise that is going to be voted on , " @entity0 told @entity11			1
" compromise has become a bad word , and i always thought in almost every case there is room for compromise			0
" @entity9 leaders should change how they use the filibuster , he said			0
" there are things that should be stopped , but at least there ought to be a vote , " he said			0
" it ca n't continue , this constant holding up bills			0
" as for what else is causing some of the rancor today , he told @entity11 " the biggest problem today is the lack of trust			1
" asked who is to blame for that , he put responsibility on both parties -- " sometimes it is the @entity68 ( @entity6 )			1
sometimes it is the @entity70 ( @entity24 )			1
" just last week senate majority leader @entity71 , @entity72 , threatened a historic change regarding the rules of how presidential nominations are considered -- eliminate the ability to filibuster them if @entity6 did n't allow votes on several of the president 's picks			1
if those changes would have gone into effect , the atmosphere in @entity3 would have deteriorated even more			0
but even the threat of the rules change created a war of words between @entity71 and @entity9 minority leader @entity88 , @entity89			0
this week the @entity9 is expected to consider a bipartisan compromise to help cap student loan rates -- a politically popular idea			0
but senators were able to reach agreement only after weeks of partisan haggling , several failed attempts and the intervention of president @entity98			0
@entity0 also sees major problems in how far his party has shifted to the right , saying a moderate from a conservative state will face problems because of " some who do n't believe they are @entity6 enough			1
" he repeated a statement he originally made in may in a television interview as a sign of how rigid the party has become , saying , " that is why i said that @entity111 i doubt could be nominated today			2
and i was a conservative and supported @entity111			0
" @entity0 , who was the @entity6 's 1996 presidential nominee , losing to incumbent @entity113 , urged his party to do a better job of trying to be more inclusive			1
in 2012 : @entity0 , @entity115 for embracing bipartisan politics " i believe we ought to be reaching out to the @entity121 community , the black community and of course the middle - and upper - class community across the board , and we have n't done that , " he said , pointing to the last election as evidence			1
after having served eight years in the @entity127 , he began his first term in the @entity9 in 1969 and served there until 1996 , when he resigned to concentrate on his run for the presidency after capturing the @entity6 nomination			1
he was @entity132 's running mate in 1976 when @entity133 lost to @entity134			0
since his time in @entity32 the @entity138 native , the longest - serving @entity6 leader in the @entity9 , has seen a dramatic change in those serving and their goals			1
" a lot of the younger members -- they are very smart			2
they have their own ideas -- start a filibuster , rather than compromise			0
" he cited how food stamps was added to the farm bill in the past as key to attracting support for the measure in both parties			0
the @entity127 earlier this month passed a scaled - down farm bill without food stamps after a version including them was defeated because it could not attract a large enough coalition			0
@entity0 , who is disabled from a @entity162 injury , also was disappointed last december after some of some of his own personal lobbying failed			1
the @entity9 blocked ratification of a @entity168 treaty to promote the rights of disabled people			0
@entity0 , in a wheelchair , came to the @entity9 floor in a last ditch effort to help the treaty gain support			1
as for his successes , he cited the @entity176 as one of the bills he was most proud of because of its lasting impact and one that had bipartisan support			0
he was also a major fundraiser in helping get the @entity184 built on the @entity185			0
@entity0 , who is special counsel in the @entity3 law firm of @entity189 's legislative and public policy group , spends his time with his wife , former sen. @entity191 , in @entity3 but is mostly out of public view			1
he is a co-founder of the @entity193 and works to support a political institute named in in his honor at the @entity196			0
@entity0 has suffered from several illnesses in recent years , and spent 11 months at @entity198 in 2010 after a bout with pneumonia			2
president @entity201 appointed @entity0 in 2007 to a panel investigating conditions at the hospital			2
" i never really thought i wanted to spend that much time there , " he joked at a 2011 appearance honoring the 50th anniversary of his being first elected to @entity32			2
asked about the milestone of his 90th birthday , @entity0 said " it 's going to be a special day			1
i do n't know how many people reach 90 , " adding " i am kind of excited about it			0
" many friends and old staff members will gather tuesday for a party celebrating his special day .			1

@entity0 says that in his time , *lawmakers* were able to work out their differences
1996 @entity6 presidential candidate says neither party is looking for middle ground now
@entity0 blames @entity6 and @entity24 equally for a lack of trust
