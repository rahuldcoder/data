@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity3 are exchanging harsh words and threats of legal action in a dispute over a whaling incident near @entity9			1
environment minister @entity10 is threatening to take @entity2 to international court , claiming a @entity2 whaling fleet attacked @entity3 ships on wednesday			1
but in the @entity2 version of what happened , it 's the @entity3 who deserve court sanctions			1
" @entity2 needs to stop this once and for all , " @entity10 told @entity3 's @entity18 on thursday			1
" what we are watching and what we 've been seeing @entity2 do in that @entity23 year on year now is just disgusting			1
no other way of describing it			0
now , as a government we do n't settle it in the car park , we settle in the court , " he said			0
" there 's been the most outrageous attack on the @entity33 ships , " said @entity31 , a member of the board of directors of @entity33 , describing it as the " worst incident " the anti-whaling group had experienced since one of its vessels sank two years ago			1
in an interview with the @entity43 ( @entity43 ) , @entity31 said that a large @entity2 factory ship , the @entity45 , had repeatedly rammed @entity33 ships in the @entity23 near @entity9 where it was trying to refuel and that a @entity2 government escort vessel had directed water cannon and lobbed concussion grenades at the activists			1
he claimed the @entity2 ships had intruded into @entity3 territorial waters and breached international and @entity3 law			1
" i 'm very concerned and alarmed that @entity2 has decided to become pirates in our territorial waters , " he said			2
" it 's time the @entity3 government acted			1
" @entity10 told @entity18 it 's not that simple			0
" in terms of sending in the @entity61 , you 've got to make sure you do n't have a response here that blows up a whole lot of other things			0
the reason -- even though they 're our territorial waters -- we do n't assert that			0
and that 's part of the whole @entity71 , which prevents mining in @entity9			0
you do n't want to blow up that system , " he explained			0
" i 've got to say with that court case we are now getting very close			0
it has been too long			0
we are now getting very close on that			0
but i 'm not going to take an action that blows up the @entity71 either , " @entity10 said			0
" what we will do , though , is take the action that we 've taken already with the @entity83 to [ expose ] that this gimmick that they 've got -- claiming that 's its scientific whaling , when everybody knows that 's a con			2
" @entity2 annually hunts whales despite a worldwide moratorium , utilizing a loophole in the law that allows for killing the mammals for scientific research			2
whale meat is commonly available for consumption in @entity2			2
each year , environmental groups such as @entity33 face off with @entity2 's hunters in a high seas drama that has led to collisions of ships , the detaining of activists and smoke bombs fired back and forth between the groups			1
the @entity106 's @entity105 disputed the @entity3 claims in a statement			1
the @entity105 says three @entity33 ships sailed recklessly and abnormally close to the @entity45 and its fueling ship during a refueling operation on wednesday			0
although the @entity45 tried to ward off the @entity3 ships with loud speakers and water cannons , the @entity33 ships ' " extreme dangerous " acts halted the refueling operation , the @entity105 said			1
during the process , the three @entity3 ships bumped the @entity45 at least four times , causing some damage , the @entity105 said			2
the @entity2 agency said it 's considering filing a third claim in a @entity124 court for @entity33 's " insults against the court authority			1
