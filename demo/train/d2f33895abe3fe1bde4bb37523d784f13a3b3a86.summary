@entity1 , @entity0 -- a schoolteacher from southern @entity0 with no previous filmmaking experience has given amateurism a good name by directing her pupils in a feature film fit for @entity9			1
@entity10 , 18 , stars in " @entity11 " as @entity11			1
it has taken a year of hard work using only one camera , but teachers and pupils at @entity17 in @entity18 , @entity19 , recently premiered their 110 - minute long adaptation of @entity0 novelist @entity22 's seminal 1874 work " @entity11			1
" " when i watched it for the first time , it was actually quite an emotional experience , " director / producer and @entity24 told @entity2			0
" it 's a kind of relief to see the efforts of what you 've worked on and achieved an absolute reality			2
" @entity33 is the driving force behind the project and says many people did n't believe she would be able to pull off a feature film when she first came up with the idea			1
" miss @entity44 pitched the idea , and said she was going to make a feature film and we all thought she was joking , " said 18 - year - old @entity40 , a @entity17 student , who plays sergeant @entity41 in the film			1
" but we all kind of went along with it and it 's turned into this			2
" @entity33 was inspired to make the feature after she directed a play with some film footage in it the previous year			1
" i thought to myself , ' i 'm going to make a film , ' " she said			2
after getting permission from the school , @entity33 sat down with @entity22 's book during the school summer holidays and over two weeks wrote a screenplay			1
in august 2008 , @entity17 's @entity22 feature went into production			1
" @entity70 " unfolds against the backdrop of rural 19th century @entity0 and tells the story of beautiful @entity11 who inherits a farm from her uncle and finds herself loved by three men			1
the feature was filmed over weekends , holidays and snatched evenings after school			1
it is full of exquisite costumes , gorgeous @entity19 vistas and faultless acting from students aged between 16 and 18 - years old			2
despite the demands of the shooting schedule , the students say they were able to fit in their schoolwork around it			0
" as far as the study goes , it 's been ok , " said @entity40			2
watch @entity2 @entity89 's @entity88 report on the @entity17 's @entity1 premiere the pupils involved say it did n't undermine their studies , and in some cases helped it by giving them an invaluable experience in an industry they would like to work in in the future			1
" some of us want to get into the profession and this experience has been really valuable , " said @entity98 , 18 , who plays shepherd @entity11			1
" we have n't done any film acting before and it 's very different to stage acting so we 've learn a lot about that			2
" but the experience has not been without challenges : using just one camera @entity33 and her team had to film a fire in a 19th century hayrick [ haystack ] , work with livestock including sheep and shoot large crowd scenes			1
in total 130 pupils worked on the film in roles from hair and make - up to walk - on parts			1
@entity10 , 18 , who stars as @entity122 , says acting for the camera was one aspect that took some getting used to			0
" at first i found it really hard to get used to the camera			0
i found it really awkward , " she said			0
" i remember the first shoot			0
i could n't even say my lines			0
" emotional scenes shot up - close requiring convincing tears and restrained acting also proved a challenge for the students who are used to acting on stage			2
" the emotional scenes were actually really difficult , " said @entity135			0
" i found them quite hard to get , with the crying and things but with mrs @entity44 's help she put me in a situation and i 'd use emotional memory and i 'd get there in the end			0
" @entity33 had no experience of filmmaking when she started up and used the @entity147 and books to learn about lighting and camera angles			0
she also picked up some tips on camera work from her 21 - year - old son , @entity153 , a broadcast production student			1
@entity153 also edited the film and @entity33 says he had the editor 's final word and helped her to keep the film slick			2
" i wanted as many students as possible to have a little showing , and he 's looking at it from a professional level of final finish			0
" the film cost a little over $ 11,000 ( Â£ 7,000 ) to make , much of which @entity33 raised from banks and supermarkets in the local community			1
" we have n't had money and we could n't get the sound right all the time and it got dark too quickly because we were trying to get it all done and it 's just been so pressurized , " says @entity33			0
nevertheless , she was always convinced she would successfully complete the film -- " it was n't ever not going to happen			0
" for @entity33 the best bit of the film is " the success for the students			0
what they must be feeling			0
that just blows me away			0
" that 's what makes me proud and if i 've helped them on their way			0
