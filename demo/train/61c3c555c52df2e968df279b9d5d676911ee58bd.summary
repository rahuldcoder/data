-- for all its swagger , @entity1 -- especially its business establishment -- does not particularly like to be the punchline of a national joke			1
that is why , for months , corporate leaders have been grumbling with dismay about the possibility of @entity10 becoming mayor			1
with the latest revival of the scandal that drove him from @entity15 , @entity10 runs a real risk of being hounded out of the race by @entity1 's business and civic leaders -- the very circle he would need to lead as mayor			1
there are 52 @entity25 companies headquartered in @entity26 , with the vast majority based in the city , including brand names such as @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34 ( the parent company of @entity0 )			0
the executives who run these firms expect a mayor cut in their mold -- a serious and energetic manager who will keep the city a safe , clean , comfortable place to do business			2
by admitting he has spent years engaged in frivolous , compulsive misconduct -- made worse by repeated lying about his habit -- @entity10 , for many real estate barons and corporate titans , utterly failed a crucial test of leadership			2
opinion : why @entity10 's problem is ours , too which is why @entity10 has nobody to blame but himself for the waves of condemnation raining down on him from the editorial boards of @entity1 's most powerful newspapers -- the news , the @entity56 and @entity58 -- which agree on little else but have all decided @entity10 should quit the race for mayor			1
@entity1 react to scandal the latest revelation is that @entity10 continued sending obscene messages and photos to a 22 - year - old stranger more than a year after resigning from @entity15 in disgrace over exactly the same behavior in 2011			1
that was a deal breaker for the @entity56			0
" he has already disqualified himself , " the paper wrote in a blistering editorial , accusing @entity10 of " a familiar but repellent pattern of misleading and evasion			2
" " he is not fit to lead @entity78 's premier city , " said the @entity74 in a front - page message about the candidate			2
" lacking the dignity and discipline that @entity1 deserves in a mayor , @entity10 must recognize that his demons have no place in @entity84			1
having built his campaign on deception , he has badly damaged the process of selecting the city 's next chief executive			1
a summer of lies politically , it has seemed for months as if @entity10 might be able to survive moral outrage over his weird compulsion to send lewd texts and photos of himself to young women			2
recent polls ranked him first or second in a crowded field of @entity99 running for mayor			0
the much higher hurdle to overcome is public exasperation over his repeated evasions about what he did and when he did it			0
in 2011 , he went on @entity0 and other news channels with a preposterous , utterly false claim that sexual messages from his accounts were the work of hackers , a charge he later admitted was a fabrication			0
more recently , @entity10 has made repeated , heartfelt claims that the destructive behavior is behind him , clearly implying the bombshell revelations that drove him from office in 2011 marked the end of his compulsions			2
it turns out that @entity10 and his wife , @entity121 , were playing a game , posing in @entity123 with their child and claiming @entity10 was on a path to emotional health and solid family life last summer -- at the same time an unrehabilitated @entity10 was sending obscene photos and holding extended text chats and phone sex sessions with a 22 - year - old stranger			0
opinion : why does @entity121 put up with @entity10 ? " maybe the couple did n't outright lie , but they did n't tell the full truth , either , " @entity133 noted in an editorial			1
all of this leaves @entity10 in a damaged position			0
his half - dozen rivals for mayor have , until now , carefully avoided directly calling attention to his problems with the truth : in at least one public forum , a crowd booed when a candidate referred to the lying			0
but the latest revelations , coming less than 50 days before the all - important september 10 @entity99 primary , have encouraged candidates to stop pulling punches			0
" the sideshows of this election have gotten in the way of the debate we should be having about the future of this city , " says one of @entity10 's rivals , @entity153			1
" @entity163 's call is an indirect reference to another candidate -- former gov. @entity165 , who is running for city comptroller after resigning as governor in the wake of revelations he hired prostitutes			0
the national media will continue to have an extended field day reporting on the flaws of the candidates for @entity1 's top two political slots			1
" the mayor of @entity1 should be a leader that all the residents of our city , especially our children , can look up to , " says @entity178 candidate @entity177			2
" @entity10 should do what is right for his family and our city and drop out of the race for mayor so we can end this soap opera			1
" that , by all indications is not going to happen			0
" this behavior is behind me , " @entity10 said at a hastily called press conference			0
will the voters buy it ? we 'll find out on primary day , september 10			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0

@entity201 : @entity10 should know @entity1 hate to be punchline of a national joke
louis : business leaders did n't want him and now they might hound him out of mayoral race
he says city 's big papers want @entity10 to drop out , and he has only himself to blame
louis : @entity10 seems to think he 'll be *forgiven* , but voters will decide on primary day
