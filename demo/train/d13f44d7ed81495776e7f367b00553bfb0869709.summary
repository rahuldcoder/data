not many mayors in the @entity1 enjoy belly rubs from their constituents			0
then again , most mayors do n't prance around town naked and curl up for naps in front of local businesses			2
for 15 years , @entity9 the cat has held the top office in @entity11 , @entity12			1
and his approval ratings have never been higher			0
" he does n't raise our taxes -- we have no sales tax			2
he does n't interfere with business			2
he 's honest , " said @entity19 , manager of @entity21 's @entity20 , which doubles as the mayor 's office			2
@entity9 may be the only mayor in the country who rose to office as an infant			1
" he was in a box full of kittens in the front of the store , and ( the owners ) were giving them away , " @entity19 said			0
she picked " @entity9 " because he had no tail			1
soon afterward , residents were n't happy with any of the human candidates in the upcoming mayoral election and voted for @entity9 as a write - in candidate			1
because @entity11 is a " historical district , " the mayoral post is more symbolic than functional , said @entity45 , president of the @entity46			1
so most residents are fine with a four - legged feline running the show			1
but the power , apparently , has gotten to @entity9 ' furry head			1
" all throughout the day i have to take care of the mayor			2
he 's very demanding , " said @entity55 , a clerk at @entity56 's			0
" he meowed and meowed and meowed and demanded to be picked up and put on the counter			0
and he demanded to be taken away from the tourists			0
then he had his long , afternoon nap			0
" in addition , the mayor will only drink water from a wine glass that has catnip in it , @entity19 added			1
but most everyone is willing to put up with the mayor 's high - maintenance lifestyle , especially because he 's a big tourist attraction for the community of about 800 human beings			1
@entity45 said the mayor frequently draws dozens of tourists who are en route to other @entity12 destinations such as @entity76			1
and as of late monday night , the mayor stubbs facebook page had well over 6,000 subscribers			0
but @entity9 remains true to his community , often showing up in local businesses -- albeit unexpectedly			1
" when my building burned down in 2002 , he was the last to come out of it , " said @entity81 , owner of @entity82 in @entity11			1
" he 's always in the restaurant			0
@entity9 wanders into every place in town			2
" even though dogs run loose and outnumber people in @entity11 , he said , the canines seem to respect @entity9 ' authority			1
" i 've never seen a dog mess with him , " @entity81 said			0
though the mayor generally receives positive reviews for his laissez - faire politics , he is guilty of frequently sleeping on the job			2
" his biggest political rivals would be other local businesses that would hate that he comes over and takes a nap and leaves fur everywhere			0
they are n't big fans of him , " @entity55 said			0
" we usually say , ' you have to deal with it			0
' " @entity107 's campaign going to the dogs -- and cats and chickens			0

@entity9 became mayor of @entity11 , @entity12 , 15 years *ago*
he won as a write - in candidate when residents did n't like the humans on the ballot
the mayor *prefers* to drink water from a wine glass with catnip in it
