-- @entity3 investigators are probing whether three men arrested last week with a stash of @entity7 products possibly bought with gift cards altered with stolen credit card data may have ties to a broader network of scammers , a law enforcement official said			1
prosecutors in @entity14 charged the three suspects , who were arrested on thursday following a traffic stop			1
in their car , prosecutors allege , the men carried 17 @entity19 and 11 @entity21 tablets , 7 itouch players , one x-box , and 9 $ 25 @entity25 cards			0
they also had a stash of 39 gift cards with magnetic strips that had been altered to carry stolen credit card data , according to court documents			1
investigators believe they used similarly altered gift cards to buy the @entity7 haul from @entity36 stores in @entity14 and @entity37 , a law enforcement official said			1
the arrests followed disclosures by @entity36 that the retailer had been the victim of a major breach that may have exposed the credit and debit card data of as many of 40 million shoppers who patronized @entity36 stores in the three weeks after @entity47			1
the timing of the arrests and the @entity36 breach prompted @entity3 financial crimes investigators to alert the @entity52 which is investigating the @entity36 breach			0
there is no indication that the @entity14 arrests are related to the @entity36 matter			2
police and other local authorities routinely turn over information on credit card thefts to the @entity52 , which investigates such crimes			2
a @entity52 spokesman declined comment beyond saying the agency continues its investigation of the @entity36 case			0
law enforcement officials and experts said altering gift cards , or other so - called stored - value cards , is a favored way for scammers to launder money and stolen credit cards			0
rather than making new fake credit cards with the stolen data , thieves use gift cards to avoid detection since cashiers are less likely to be suspicious			0
point of sale machines in stores read the magnetic strip data and wo n't detect that a gift card is carrying stolen credit card data .			0
