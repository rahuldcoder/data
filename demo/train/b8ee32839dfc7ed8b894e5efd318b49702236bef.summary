editor 's note : @entity2 is @entity3 's national security analyst and a fellow at the @entity5 in @entity6 and at @entity8 's @entity7			1
his most recent book is " the @entity10 : an @entity12 's leader			2
" @entity2 says it 's crucial to correctly frame the nature of a war before beginning it			1
@entity6 ( @entity3 ) -- president - elect @entity17 and his foreign policy advisers and speechwriters are wrestling with one of the most important speeches of his presidency , his inaugural address			0
one of their toughest conceptual challenges is how to describe and recast what the @entity27 administration has consistently termed the " war on terror			1
" the dean of military strategists , @entity32 , explains the importance of this decision - making in his treatise " @entity36 " : " the first , the supreme , the most decisive act of judgment that the statesman and commander have to make is to establish ... the kind of war on which they are embarking ; neither mistaking it for , nor trying to turn it into something that is alien to its nature			0
" @entity32 's excellent advice about the absolute necessity of properly defining the war upon which a nation is about to embark was ignored by @entity27 administration officials who instead declared an open - ended and ambiguous " war on terror " after the @entity54 was attacked on september 11 , 2001			1
@entity27 took the nation to war against a tactic , rather than a war against a specific enemy , which was obviously @entity12 and anyone allied to it			1
when the @entity54 went to war against the @entity66 and the @entity67 during @entity68 , president @entity63 and his congressional supporters did not declare war against u-boats and kamikaze pilots , but on the @entity73 state and @entity74			1
the war on terror , sometimes known as the " @entity77 " or by the clunky acronym @entity77 , became the lens through which the @entity27 administration judged almost all of its foreign policy decisions			1
that proved to be dangerously counterproductive on several levels			0
the @entity77 framework propelled the @entity27 administration into its disastrous entanglement in @entity86			2
it had nothing to do with 9/11 but was launched under the rubric of the war on terror and the erroneous claims that @entity93 had weapons of mass destruction			2
the theory was that he might give such weapons to terrorists , including @entity12 to whom he was supposedly allied , and that he therefore threatened @entity54 interests			1
none of this , of course , turned out to be true			0
the @entity27 administration 's approach to the war on terror collided badly with another of its doctrines , spreading democracy in the @entity111 as a panacea to reduce radicalism			1
it pushed for elections in the @entity117 territories in which , in early 2006 , the more radical @entity118 won a resounding victory , propelled to power on a wave of popular revulsion for the incompetence and corruption of the @entity127 party that had dominated @entity117 politics since the 1960s			0
imprisoned by its war on terror framework , the @entity27 administration supported @entity131 in a disastrous war against @entity133 in @entity134 in the summer of 2006			1
@entity133 is not only a terrorist group but is also part of the rickety @entity134 government and runs social welfare services across the country , yet for the @entity27 administration its involvement in terrorism was all that mattered			2
as is now widely understood in @entity131 , the war against @entity133 was a moral and tactical defeat for the @entity131 military and government			0
events in the current @entity131 incursion in @entity147 will determine whether history repeats itself			0
under the banner of the war on terror , the @entity27 administration also tied itself in conceptual knots conflating the threat from @entity12 with @entity154 groups like @entity133 and the ayatollahs in @entity156			1
in 2006 , for instance , president @entity27 claimed that " the @entity159 and @entity154 extremist represent different faces of the same threat			2
" in reality , @entity159 and @entity154 extremists have been killing each other in large numbers for years in countries from @entity167 to @entity86			0
the groups have differing attitudes toward the @entity54 , which @entity159 extremists attacked in 1993 and again on 9/11 , while @entity154 militants have never done so			2
so , how to reconceptualize the @entity77 ? contrary to a common view among @entity172 , who have lived through the bombing campaigns of various nationalist and leftist terror groups for decades , @entity12 is not just another criminal / terrorist group that can be dealt with by police action and law enforcement alone			2
after all , a terrorist organization like the @entity181 would call in warnings before its attacks and its single largest massacre killed 29 people			0
by contrast , @entity12 has declared war on the @entity54 repeatedly -- as it did for the first time to a @entity190 audience during @entity10 's 1997 interview with @entity3			1
following that declaration of war , the terror group attacked @entity54 embassies , a @entity54 warship , the @entity196 and the financial heart of the @entity54 , killing thousands of civilians without warning ; acts of war by any standard			1
@entity202 is obviously at war with the @entity54 and so to respond by simply recasting the @entity77 as the @entity203 , the @entity204 , would be foolish and dangerous			2
what kind of war then should the @entity54 fight against @entity12 ? for that we should learn some lessons from the conceptual errors of the @entity27 administration			1
nine days after 9/11 , @entity27 addressed @entity212 in a speech watched live by tens of millions of @entity54 in which he said that @entity12 followed in the footsteps " of the murderous ideologies of the 20th century ... they follow in the path of fascism , nazism and totalitarianism , " implying that the fight against @entity12 would be similar to @entity68 or the @entity223			1
for the @entity27 administration , painting the conflict in such existential terms had the benefit of casting the president as the heroic reincarnation of @entity229 and anyone who had the temerity to question him as the reincarnation of @entity234 's arch - appeaser , @entity235			2
but this portrayal of the war on terror was massively overwrought			2
the @entity66 occupied and subjugated most of @entity172 and instigated a global conflict that killed tens of millions			0
and when the @entity54 fought the @entity66 , the country spent 40 percent of its gross domestic product to do so and fielded millions of soldiers			0
in his inaugural address , @entity17 should say that the @entity54 is indeed at " war against @entity12 and its allies , " but that as @entity63 said in his inaugural address in 1933 , the only thing we have to fear is fear itself			1
if @entity54 are not terrorized by terrorists , then the @entity54 has won against them			0
@entity202 and its allies are threats to the @entity54 and @entity54 living and working overseas , but they are far from all - powerful			0
barring an exceptional event like september 11 , 2001 , in any given year @entity54 are more likely to die of snake bites or lightning strikes than a terrorist attack			0
despite the hyperventilating rhetoric of @entity10 , @entity12 's amateur investigations into weapons of mass destruction do not compare to the very real possibility of nuclear conflagration that we faced during the @entity223			0
there are relatively few adherents of @entity265 in the @entity266 today , while there were tens of millions of devotees of communism and fascism			0
@entity17 should also make it clear that instead of the @entity27 formulation of " either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists , " the @entity17 administration doctrine will be , " anyone who is against the terrorists is with us			0
" after all it is only @entity12 and its several affiliates in countries like @entity86 , @entity134 and @entity282 and allied groups such as the @entity284 that kill @entity54 soldiers and civilians and attack @entity54 interests around the globe			1
everyone else in the world is a potential or actual ally in the fight against @entity12 and its affiliates , because those organizations threaten almost every category of institution , government and ethnic grouping			0
this is the first of two commentaries on the war on terror			0
read the second piece , @entity2 's commentary on what principles @entity17 should follow in waging war against @entity12 and its allies , friday , january 9 on @entity3 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : @entity27 never correctly framed the " global war on terror "
he says the president went to war against the tactic of terrorism
instead , @entity2 says , the @entity54 should be leading a war *vs.* @entity12
@entity320 is a *formidable* enemy , but not the *equivalent* of fascism
