-- thousands of green card applicants will no longer " age out " and have to go to the back of the line if they turn 21 during the protracted @entity10 immigration process , an appeals court has ruled in a defeat for the federal government			1
wednesday 's narrow 6 - 5 decision , from the @entity13 - based @entity10 9th @entity12 , reverses earlier court rulings			1
the decision affects " tens of thousands of families " -- specifically , the unmarried sons and daughters of those who waited for years as a parent sought a visa in the @entity10 -- said @entity21 , a lawyer representing the victors in the case			1
" after 10 years and a lawsuit that 's gone on for years , these families are finally going to be back together , " @entity21 said			1
the ruling applies to those who were under 21 when their families came to the @entity10 after being sponsored by a relative who is a @entity10 citizen			1
subsequently , their father or mother applied for a visa , at which time their children could be in line to receive a " derivative visa			1
" such visas are available only to spouses and unmarried children under 21			1
so what happens when , as they are waiting for their status to be resolved -- often for years -- these children become 21 and older ? the federal government argued that , once those in the former group " age out , " they should start again in a new phase in the process , with no credit for the time they waited originally for the derivative visa			1
this has been the case for years			0
people applying for green cards often wait through administrative delays for their petitions to be processed , as well as often longer periods waiting for one of a limited number of visas to become available			2
the current wait time for those seeking a green card in the @entity69 category -- for unmarried sons or daughters of a lawful permanent resident -- for @entity73 , for instance , is about 20 years , according to this month 's @entity74 published by the @entity75			2
@entity76 stepped into the fray in 2002 with the passage of the @entity79			0
among other provisions , it stated that " the alien 's petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition			0
" in other words , people do n't lose their place in line after they turn 21			1
the @entity93 has contended in court that this legislation was unclear about to whom this language applies -- contending , for instance , that it is relevant for some groups but not those unmarried children who had been in line for derivative visas			1
furthermore , the agency argued that changing the equation will unfairly affect those already waiting for a limited number of visas , by effectively skipping ahead of them ( and making them wait longer )			0
the judges ' majority opinion , however , states that @entity76 ' intent in passing the @entity79 was " to extend automatic conversion and priority date retention to all family - sponsored derivative beneficiaries			2
" furthermore , they find complaints that changes will produce unnecessary and unreasonable problems for the @entity93 are not valid			0
" the plain language of the @entity79 is not impracticable , " the judges said			0
" it is the agency 's task to resolve ... complications , not the courts			0
" the @entity126 did not respond immediately thursday when asked for comment on the case			0
@entity21 speculated another recent federal court decision out of @entity130 that followed much the same reasoning as wednesday 's ruling may have had " a tremendous " impact in the @entity135 's reversal			1
we 've been fighting this for three or four years and not winning , " @entity21 said			0
in other cases , he contends , the federal government " always credits for the time you stood in line			0
" but not all agreed with wednesday 's ruling			0
@entity143 , the president for the @entity144 , contends that if @entity76 " had wanted indefinite eligibility regardless of age , they would have raised the overall number of visas in the category to prevent further increases in the backlog			0
" " the court is substituting its judgment for that of expert administrative agencies , making the system even more dysfunctional , " @entity143 said in a statement to @entity0			2
" immigration is a civil benefit , and either you are under 21 or you are not			2

@entity135 , by a 6 - 5 vote , reverses an earlier immigration ruling
sons and daughters once in line for " derivative visas " wo n't lose their place after turning 21
" these families are finally going to be back together , " a victorious lawyer says
" immigration *reform* " *advocate* says ruling makes the " system even more dysfunctional "
