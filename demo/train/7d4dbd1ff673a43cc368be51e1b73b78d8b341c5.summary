some people think @entity1 , which comes right in the middle of @entity3 , is overdoing it			1
if " underdoing it " were a phrase , it 's the one i would use			2
on most days in most months , most women and girls are n't able to raise their voices			2
because no one knows the challenges they face , they 're forced to face them on their own			0
on @entity1 , however , we make a point of hearing the voices of every woman and girl			1
today , we make sure that every woman and every girl counts -- literally			1
i 'm talking about a project that combines two of my favorite topics : women 's empowerment and data			1
the media sometimes call @entity30 and me " data nerds			2
" i 'm not sure they mean it as a compliment , but i wear it as a badge of pride anyway			0
if you use it right , it tells the hidden stories of millions of women and girls			2
that 's why the @entity47 and @entity48 foundations are teaming up to conduct a global review of the status of women and girls everywhere			1
where they 're thriving -- and why			2
where they 're being held back -- and why			2
this initiative is called @entity57 : the @entity58			0
the seed for this project was planted in 1995 at the @entity61			0
that 's where @entity63 gave her famous speech declaring " women 's rights are human rights			1
" it 's also where 189 countries came together to agree on an agenda for women 's equality			1
now , nearly 20 years later , it 's time to check in to see whether we 're meeting those goals			1
my husband @entity30 and i used a trove of data to drive our decision making at @entity80 , and we brought that mentality to our work at the foundation , though the data is much harder to come by when it comes to development			2
it 's troubling that it 's possible to produce precise reports about software sales in @entity91 , but we have only rough estimates of how many mothers die during childbirth every year			0
why is data an indispensible tool for improving the lives of women and girls ? first , it helps us make the case to world leaders that empowering women is n't just the right thing to do , it 's the smart thing			1
the data says that women spend 90 cents of every dollar they make on their children			1
they prioritize things like health care , nutritious food , and education			0
as a result , a child in a household where the mother controls the budget is 20 % more likely to survive -- and much more likely to thrive			0
healthier , more educated children today means a stronger workforce tomorrow			0
i 've seen firsthand that this argument resonates with finance ministers -- even those who are otherwise skeptical about the need to invest in women and girls			1
there 's another reason data is so important			1
it helps us see where women and girls are being left behind , so we know where to target resources			0
for example , in the @entity135 state of @entity136 , data showed that women were dying during childbirth at alarming rates and giving birth in hospitals at very low rates			1
in response , health officials decided to encourage women to give birth in hospitals and to improve the quality of care in delivery rooms			0
now , our partners in @entity136 are collecting data every six months to monitor their progress and adjust their strategies as necessary to keep getting better results			0
above all , data is powerful because of the women behind it			1
we should never lose sight of the fact that every data point represents a mother , a daughter , or a sister			0
every data point represents big dreams for the future			0
on a recent trip to @entity169 , i met women who had pooled their savings			0
with their shared funds , they bought chickens so they could sell eggs for extra income			0
when i asked them what they 'd use the money for , they all said : their children 's education			0
their investments in their children were a monument to their hope for the future			0
all of these women could see a better life for their families -- and , as members of the savings circle , they could envision themselves helping create it			1
on this @entity1 , i hope you 'll take the time to learn more about women who are working hard to raise their voices			1
pick a topic you care about -- maternal mortality , women 's economic participation , family planning -- and learn about the people whose lives it touches			1
as you read over the data , remember that the numbers you see tell the story of real women with real dreams			2
it 's up to us to make sure they count			1
and it 's up to us to keep the spotlight on them all year long			0
if we do , then by next @entity1 , we 'll have even more reasons to celebrate .			2
