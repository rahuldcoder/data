@entity0 , @entity1 -- no two @entity4 concerts are ever alike , which is one of the reasons why the @entity8 singer remains such a mesmerizing performer well into his sixth decade			1
at the intimate @entity13 theatre in @entity0 , southern @entity1 , he and the seeds are on relaxed form as they give spellbinding renditions of much - loved older material like " @entity18 , " " @entity19 , " and " @entity20 , " and songs from this year 's new album , " @entity21			1
" this album is the first to be released without long - serving guitarist @entity25 and marks a more mellow and starker sound than on recent albums			0
" the things that we do n't understand			0
they 're the best , " he says as he launches into " @entity31 , a song written before the recent discovery of the so - called " @entity34			0
" the new album also finds him observing the boys on @entity0 's beach flirting with the " silly " girls -- it 's a real return to form for @entity40 after some albums of mixed quality , and his best since 2004 's " @entity44			1
" perhaps his garage - rock side - project @entity46 has allowed for a return to more reflective material , but as ever the @entity4 are peerless in switching from quiet to crashingly loud on songs like " @entity50 , " always a highlight of a @entity4 gig			1
the sound and quality of musicianship are both superb and his voice remains both tender and strong , despite his 56 years			0
there is no doubting his commitment on this night , the first of 18 concerts of a @entity63 tour			1
self - assured , almost like a preacher - man @entity64 , he has a magnetic and unique presence on stage			0
stick - thin and resplendent in shiny black suit , @entity40 is constantly on the move , prowling , kicking his long legs high in the air and holding the hands of members of the audience as he alternately croons and screams			2
he is in easy - going , crowd - pleasing form , taking requests and seemingly enjoying being back on the road			2
one recent reviewer memorably described @entity40 as making " @entity79 sound as exhilarating as an acid trip at the funfair			2
" do n't miss the fun .			0

@entity4 kick off 25 - date @entity63 tour in his *hometown* , @entity0
@entity40 on relaxed form as he gives spellbinding renditions of much - loved older material
*bad* seeds peerless in switching from quiet to crashingly loud on songs like " @entity50 "
