it 's getting harder to remember life before september 11 , 2001 , but as soon as you walk through the door , the @entity2 aims to take you back there			1
@entity6 was first elected on november 7 , 2000 , and sworn in on january 20 , 2001 , so the months before the 9/11 terrorist attack were but a brief moment in the @entity6 presidency			1
those moments are represented by the first museum exhibits , part of the 43rd president 's library to be dedicated thursday in @entity15			1
@entity6 43 : ' @entity16 will ultimately judge ' all five living @entity18 presidents are expected to attend the ceremonies			1
displays of the legacy he intended for himself -- the so - called @entity6 - era tax cuts , his signature " @entity31 " education reform , his faith - based community initiatives -- quickly give way to the moment that unexpectedly defined his presidency			1
by the @entity32 : presidential libraries the bright red dress first lady @entity34 wore to her husband 's first state dinner , just six days before 9/11 , stands in contrast to the next , most talked about artifact in the museum - the twisted hulk of two beams from the @entity43			2
employees giving the media a tour said it is believed to be the point where the second aircraft hit the @entity50 , the first tower to collapse			0
" the whole presidency was changed on 9/11 and it could not be otherwise , " @entity6 's former chief of staff @entity52 told @entity54			1
" it was a very different presidency from then on			2
that 's dramatically portrayed in this museum			2
" 5 presidents on hand for @entity6 center dedication in most museums , touching the exhibits is not allowed			1
here though , visitors are encouraged to reach out and touch the dark steel and tangibly connect to that day that changed @entity18			1
" @entity70 walked a family through recently and realized that the children who were on the tour with him were n't alive on september 11 , " the former first lady told reporters at the museum on wednesday			0
" they had no direct memory of it like all of us do and it 's important , i think , to remind people of it			0
" history 's jury is still out on @entity6 what comes after the wreckage from the @entity43 is the hallmark of @entity6 's time in office : the war on terror			1
above the bullhorn @entity6 used on sept. 14 , 2001 , to address workers at " @entity93 " is the key quote from his remarks at the @entity96 on the same day : " this conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others			2
it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing			0
" flash points of terrorism are pinpointed on a large map of the world			0
critics of @entity6 's decision to invade @entity111 on the basis of weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist or his policies on interrogation techniques of terrorist detainees will find no apologies here			1
but there is some introspection			0
in the @entity122 , an interactive exhibit based on the president 's book by the same name , visitors can try their hand at making the decisions @entity6 considered his toughest : invading @entity111 , implementing the so - called " surge " of troops there in 2007 , the federal response to @entity130 and the unprecedented government intervention during the financial crisis			1
@entity136 : @entity6 came through on @entity130 just this month @entity6 said he is " comfortable " with his legacy on the @entity111 war and those close to him shrug off the effect sustained criticism has had on him			2
but this exhibit aims to challenge visitors with an implicit question : could you have done any better ? museum - goers can request advice from top aides and military commanders before voting on how they would respond			0
" they get pestered by press to make a decision , to give an answer			0
then at the end , they get to decide , ' what would you do ? ' after the audience votes , the president comes on and tells what he decided and why he decided , " @entity52 explains			0
" but it 's all intended to give people a sense of what it 's like to be president , and to give them a sense that a lot of the issues that people have made up their minds on are a lot tougher than they might have imagined			0
" there 's also a lighter side to the experience			0
a replica of the @entity175 leaves you feeling like you are in the @entity178 rather than on the @entity15 campus of @entity180 , where the museum is located			0
the @entity183 jackets worn by president and mrs. @entity34 aboard the presidential aircraft are prominently featured			0
@entity186 , @entity187 in spotlight before @entity6 library dedication there is a significant amount of square footage dedicated to the presidential pets			1
@entity183 dog bowls used by @entity195 and @entity196 , the @entity6 family 's @entity197 , are displayed next to a deflated volleyball that @entity195 loved to play with on the @entity200 of the @entity178			1
for those close to the former president , the dedication of the @entity2 is a time to reflect on his legacy and also the public perception of a controversial commander - in - chief			2
@entity6 's approval rating has improved since he left the @entity178 but it 's still a markedly low 47 percent , according to the latest @entity212 / @entity211 poll			1
a new @entity54 / @entity214 poll shows that a growing number of @entity18 -- 42 % -- say @entity6 's presidency was a success , up 11 % since he left office in 2009 , but 55 % say it was a failure			1
" over time when the emotions fade you can take a more objective look and i think that will benefit president @entity6 , " @entity52 told @entity54			2
" one of the really cool things about [ him ] is he does n't care very much			0
i mean , he 's not fixated on his own personal popularity			0
what he cares about is he did the best he could , he applied principle , very strong principle , to some tough problems , and he will be comfortable with history 's judgment			0

the @entity2 will be dedicated thursday
all five living @entity18 presidents are expected to attend the ceremonies
@entity6 's presidency changed dramatically after 9/11
