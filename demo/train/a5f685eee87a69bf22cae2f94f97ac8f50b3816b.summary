-- the electronic component visible in a law enforcement image of an intercepted suspicious shipment from @entity5 appears to be a printed circuit board from a disassembled cell phone , an engineer told @entity0 friday			1
" this size and the shape of the @entity14 ( printed circuit board ) are typical to a handset cell phone type device , " wrote @entity8 , hardware application engineering manager for a large @entity11 - based cell phone parts manufacturer			1
@entity8 prepared the e-mailed analysis of the image at @entity0 's request			0
his analysis was supported by information from a source close to the investigation into two @entity11 - bound suspicious packages , who said the devices appear to be designed to be detonated by a cell phone			1
cell phones have been widely used by terrorist groups as a means of triggering bombs			1
" the component on the top right part of the device seems to be a digital camera sensor , " @entity8 wrote in his analysis			2
" the area with a rectangular grey material [ held ] a display that was removed			0
" " on the left of the device , under the two metallic shield cans are most likely the baseband processor or the display controller			2
" a baseband processor is critical to the function of a digital cell phone			1
" there is as well a coin type cell ( which ) is a backup battery , and 2 board to board connectors			2
on one of these connectors is plugged a keypad that was as well removed			0
another metallic component on the top left of the electronic board ( partly hidden under a screw ) seems to be a small vibration component , used on cell phones ( when vibrate mode is enabled )			1
so this board is very likely to be the main electronic board of a cell phone device			1
" the source close to the investigation said a highly explosive compound known as @entity66 was found in both devices in amounts large enough to trigger a powerful blast			1
@entity66 was allegedly one of the components of the bomb concealed by @entity73 , the @entity74 man accused of trying to set off an explosion aboard @entity76 as it approached @entity77 , @entity78 , on december 25			0
@entity73 is alleged to have been carrying 80 grams of @entity66 in that botched attack			0
by comparison , the source said the two devices found in the @entity83 and the @entity84 on friday contained multiple times more petn			1
just six grams of the material is enough to blow a hole in the fuselage of an aircraft			0
a @entity90 search for the numbered markings on the printed circuit board produced several links to the @entity95 mobile phone			2
the @entity95 is a similar shape to the circuit board			0
the @entity95 is a @entity99 - brand gsm two - band phone that allows the unit to work in most countries in the world , including the @entity11			1
@entity8 cautioned , however , that " it was not obvious that this board is the @entity95 phone			0
" in the law enforcement photo , the cell phone circuit board is crudely mounted with screws , metal and plastic fragments to what appears to be a stout metal case			1
wires lead from the circuit board out of the frame			0
sources familiar with the investigation tell @entity0 that the suspicious shipments from @entity5 contained computer printers			2
the metal case on which the circuit board is mounted would be consistent with the frame of a laser printer			0
law enforcement sources have also told @entity0 that explosives were packed in printer toner cartridges			0
a @entity11 official says while the explosive was likely the highly volatile petn , testing is ongoing			2
@entity0 's @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 contributed to this report .			0

new : source : devices in packages appear to be designed to be detonated by a cell phone
the electronic device was found in a suspicious package bound for the @entity11 from @entity5
the size and shape of the device are typical to a cell phone , expert says
cell phones have been widely used by terrorist groups to trigger bombs
