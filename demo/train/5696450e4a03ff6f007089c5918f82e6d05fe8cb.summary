@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 in @entity1 have released a second audiotape purportedly containing the voice of their leader , @entity6 , who sources say was wounded in a suspected drone strike this week			1
the group also released an audiotape friday , though @entity2 could not confirm that the voice on either tape belongs to @entity6			1
it was unclear whether the first tape was recorded before or after thursday 's drone strike , but the voice on the second tape announced the date as saturday			1
" let me say this briefly , that i , @entity6 , today , on the 16th of january , with central spokesman @entity20 and @entity21 , want to give this message to all mujahedeen : that by the grace of @entity25 , i , @entity6 , am alive and in good health			1
neither have i been martyred in a drone attack nor injured , " the voice says on saturday 's tape			2
@entity20 , a @entity3 spokesman , denied thursday and again friday that @entity6 was hurt			1
@entity20 said @entity6 had left the site of the attack -- a converted religious school -- before the missiles struck			0
he dismissed reports of an injury to @entity6 as propaganda			2
however , other @entity3 and intelligence sources said doctors were treating @entity6 for wounds he sustained in the drone strike			1
@entity20 delivered both audiotapes to local journalists			0
on the tape released friday , the voice says , " the media right now is also part of the war			0
the enemy through the media wants to demoralize the @entity3			0
at times they spread the propaganda in the media that ' we have martyred @entity6			0
' at other times they say , ' we have completed the operation in @entity58 , ' but this will never happen			0
" the drone strike hit a madrassa , or religious school , that local officials said had been converted into a militant training camp			1
ten people were killed in the strike , @entity1 intelligence and local officials said			1
in the friday tape , the speaker warns of what will happen if the drone strikes continue			2
" i want to inform the @entity1 people that the drone attacks that take place in the tribal areas endanger the politics , well - being and sovereignty of @entity1 , " the speaker says			2
" from today onward , for any dangerous step that the @entity1 @entity3 will take in @entity1 , those responsible will be @entity1 's rulers , not the @entity3			2
this is because the @entity1 rulers want to spill the blood of the innocent [ tribesmen ] in exchange for dollars			0
" the @entity87 military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by drones , or unmanned aircraft			0
the @entity87 is the only country operating in the region known to have the ability to launch missiles from remote - controlled aircraft			0
last week , the @entity3 released a video showing @entity6 sitting next to @entity97 , the man who killed seven @entity99 employees and a @entity101 army captain at an eastern @entity103 base december 30			1
the @entity1 @entity3 claimed responsibility for that attack			2
it was carried out out to avenge the death of @entity6 's predecessor , @entity107 , who died in a suspected @entity87 drone strike last year , according to @entity110 's commander of operations in @entity103 , @entity112			1
@entity107 and @entity6 are from the same tribe , but not from the same family			0
