@entity0 , @entity1 -- the trial of disgraced @entity6 high - flyer @entity4 concluded monday with a dramatic final flourish as he accused the former police chief who brought about his downfall of having a crush on his wife			1
@entity4 's politically sensitive corruption trial has brought forth a plethora of rich , eye - opening details about the apparently lavish and emotionally fraught life of his family and inner circle , giving @entity1 people insights into how some of the ruling elite live			1
but at the same time , doubts have arisen about the completeness of the account of court proceedings provided by @entity1 authorities			1
still , over the past five days , the court has heard allegations of adultery , a punch to the head , squabbles over a villa on the @entity34 and attempts to cover up the murder of a @entity38 businessman			1
was @entity4 's trial truly transparent ? as the trial wrapped up monday , the prosecution called for @entity4 to be strictly punished over the charges of bribery , embezzlement and abuse of power			1
the court in the eastern city of @entity0 said the verdict would be announced at a later date			1
@entity4 , a charismatic and divisive leader when he was in power , has kept up a steady attack on the case against him throughout the hearings			1
in comments monday published by the court , @entity4 complained that " not even the worst tv script writers could come up with such plots " as some of the bribery accusations			1
but he then proceeded to describe a storyline worthy of a soap opera , suggesting a romantic link between two figures who played central roles in the drama that ended his political career			0
the people in question are @entity70 , @entity4 's former police chief in the southwestern metropolis of @entity73 , whose failed attempt to defect to the @entity75 in february 2012 precipitated the crisis that shook the @entity6 to its foundations ; and @entity78 , @entity4 's wife , who is now in prison after a court convicted her last year of murdering @entity81 , a @entity38 businessman and associate of the @entity83			1
prosecutors accuse @entity4 of threatening and improperly firing @entity70 after learning of @entity78 's suspected involvement in @entity81 's murder			2
five things not to have missed a punch or a slap ? @entity70 , who is now serving a 15 - year prison sentence for multiple offenses , said in testimony over the weekend that upon learning of the suspicions , @entity4 punched him in the head , bloodying his mouth and causing a " discharge " from his ear			2
@entity70 told prosecutors that @entity4 's physical violence against him , as well as the disappearance of his aides and investigators , led to his decision to seek refuge in the @entity75 diplomatic mission in @entity107			2
@entity4 denies punching @entity70 , claiming it was just a slap			2
and over the weekend , he questioned @entity70 's reliability , saying " this man has extremely bad character and lies on the spot			0
" in his statement monday , @entity4 offered a new explanation for @entity70 's attempted defection			2
" the true reason of @entity70 's flight was because he had a crush on @entity78 and he could n't get over it , " @entity4 said , alleging that @entity70 had confessed his feelings to @entity78 and " slapped himself eight times			1
" in written and video testimony shown in court last week , @entity78 linked @entity4 to some of the crimes the prosecution alleges			1
@entity4 responded by suggesting that as she 'd already been convicted , she lacked credibility and was seeking a more lenient sentence			2
the allegation of @entity70 's feelings for @entity78 added a fresh layer of intrigue to the case , which has drawn widespread interest on @entity137 , @entity1 's @entity138 - like microblog service			0
the court 's official @entity137 account , which provided updates on developments inside the courtroom , now has more than half a million followers			0
how and why @entity1 politician veered off script doubts about the court 's reporting but with journalists from the international news media denied access to the courtroom , the comprehensiveness of the court 's version of events is in question			0
the official microblog reported only selected parts of what transpired during the trial , two individuals with detailed knowledge of the court proceedings told @entity2			1
the microblog leaves out some parts that may put @entity4 in a good light , they said			1
some of @entity4 's courtroom comments expunged from the official account include his detailing of threats made against him and his family by investigators , the sources told @entity2			1
during his incarceration , according to those sources , @entity4 said investigators warned him of the possibility of his wife 's execution and his son 's arrest , and told him about the cases of other prominent officials -- one of whom confessed and was spared and another who did not cooperate and was executed			1
@entity4 spoke for almost half an hour on monday , much longer than what the court transcripts show , according to the sources			1
they said after @entity4 delivered his closing remarks , five family members in court stood up , clapping and saying : " @entity192 said , @entity4 ! we will always be with you			1
" despite the restrictions on the flow of information , @entity1 state - run media have highlighted the microblog disclosures as a new level of transparency			0
" they see this as an opportunity to present @entity1 as a country where rule of law is developing and where the judicial system is becoming more mature , " said political commentator and columnist @entity202			0
" but at the same time , they want to have some control			0
" timeline : @entity4 scandal ' a good legal mind ' based on the information that the court has divulged , @entity4 has come across as a combative defendant , denying allegations against him and attacking the credibility of prosecution witnesses			1
" i think he has performed very well in court , " @entity202 said			0
" he seems to have a good legal mind and has been able to argue his own case very well			0
" but despite his assertive performance , many observers still expect him to be convicted in a legal system where the @entity6 controls police , prosecution and courts			0
@entity4 appeared to acknowledge his likely fate during his final statement monday			2
" there are times when i felt weak , because i know i 'm doomed and there 's no escape for me , " he said			0
" ending up in prison , i have mixed feelings toward the rest of my life			0
" trial by social media the rise of a princeling @entity4 is a princeling , a term that refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence			1
his late father , @entity250 , was a revolutionary contemporary of chairman @entity251 and the late paramount leader @entity252			0
over the past three decades , @entity4 rose to power as a city mayor , provincial governor , minister of commerce and member of the @entity256 , the powerful policy - making body of the @entity6			1
with the help of @entity70 , he was credited with a spectacular , albeit brutal , crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of @entity73			0
@entity4 's populist policies drew admirers and detractors , but he ultimately ran afoul of party power brokers			2
long underwear from the 1960s his high profile and connections among the nation 's ruling elite have made his case an extremely delicate matter for @entity1 authorities			0
the court hearings have included plentiful details about the jet - set lifestyle led by @entity4 's wife and youngest son , which prosecutors allege was funded by rich businessmen to secure influence from @entity4			1
the favors mentioned include a villa in the @entity288 , and trips to destinations around the globe for the son , @entity292 , who is now living in the @entity75			0
@entity4 has denied he knew details about where the money was coming from			2
and on monday , he sought to play up his @entity296 credentials			0
" i have no interest in clothing , " he said			0
" my thermal long underpants were bought by my mother in the 1960s			0
" nonetheless , the portrait that has emerged of @entity4 , his family and their former position near the top of the @entity1 system has proved revealing			2
" since the founding of the @entity6 and the @entity313 , this has been the only time that connections among the party , government , judiciary , politicians ' private lives , as well as power and interests , are explained in such a clear , public and entertaining way , " the dissident @entity1 artist @entity308 wrote on his @entity138 account			0
