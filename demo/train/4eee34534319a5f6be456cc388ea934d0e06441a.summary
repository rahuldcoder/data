" it 's been seven years , and a lot has changed , " @entity0 said sunday in her first visit to @entity2 since the state dealt her presidential campaign a devastating body blow			1
but there was a moment in the afternoon when it seemed like not much had			2
roughly 200 credentialed media were gathered in a far corner of the @entity13 , the grassy expanse where sen. @entity15 was convening his 37th and final @entity17 , an annual fundraiser that doubles as a point of entry for ambitious @entity21 curious about the @entity23 caucuses			1
after a 90 - minute wait , the press scrum -- scribblers and photographers alike -- were herded like cattle through a series of gates and escorted up to a hot smoking grill , waiting to capture the same image : a staged shot of @entity34 and @entity0 , fresh out of their motorcade , ritualistically flipping steaks with @entity15			1
@entity0 stumps for @entity23 @entity21 , and herself the @entity40 ignored the half - hearted shouted questions from reporters -- " mr. president , do you eat meat ? " -- with practiced ease			1
they were two football fields away from the nearest voter			2
mechanical , distant , heavy - handed : the afternoon spectacle felt a lot like @entity0 's 2008 caucus campaign , a succession of errors that crumbled under the weight of a feuding top - heavy staff and the candidate 's inability to connect with her party 's grassroots			1
and then the head fake -- and something different			2
after a few minutes , the @entity40 walked into a nearby barn , out of view			2
most of the media swarm gave up and hustled back to the main event , where nearly 7,000 @entity21 were eating red meat and waiting patiently in the sunshine to hear from two of the most famous people in the world			1
a few dozen press were still milling about when the duo re-emerged			2
" there she is ! " a television reporter screamed , clamoring for her cameraman			2
an early moment of engagement there she was			2
@entity34 , too , walking along a fence and gabbing with a small army of political reporters , a chore that has never come easy for @entity0 , and one she has assiduously avoided since leaving the @entity89			1
it 's hardly a shock that the voluble ex-president handled a rope line full of reporters with gusto			1
but the willingness of the more reticent @entity0 to thrust herself into the gaping maw of the hungry press dragon signaled , perhaps , that she and her aides are eager for a fresh start in @entity2 , and with the national media , if she runs for president once again			1
she kept both the state and the press at arm 's length during her last campaign , with troublesome consequences			1
on sunday , though , she gave it a go -- an early moment of engagement with the media and voters that revealed an understanding of past mistakes , but also the difficult road ahead if she takes the 2016 plunge			1
" good to see you ! " she told the assembled press , surely a half - truth			2
" my goodness ! you guys having a good time ? good			0
we 're having a good time today			0
" strutting back and forth , @entity126 declared that it was " fabulous to be back " in the state			0
" i love @entity23 , " she said , smiling as if she were in on a joke			0
she entertained and swatted away a bombardment of questions , mostly of the unremarkable " will you run ? " variety			1
" does this whet your appetite for another campaign ? " asked one reporter			0
" we 're here to help @entity21 , " @entity126 responded , offering requisite praise for @entity23 's @entity21 candidates , @entity142 hopeful @entity141 , gubernatorial challenger @entity143 and congressional candidate @entity144			1
this long - awaited interaction , so craved by the access - starved political press , was short - lived			0
never quite at ease in these situations , @entity126 milled about for five minutes or so , keeping a few feet between herself and the press , before walking back into the secure barn			0
the other @entity126 -- now he likes to talk @entity126 , meanwhile , was having at it , holding court with reporters for a good 20 minutes -- much of it with @entity158 host @entity157 -- while his wife , the presumed candidate - in - waiting , was nowhere in sight			1
@entity34 sidled up with @entity15 and held forth with the press on all manner of topics : the ' 92 campaign , the prospect of being a grandparent , the scourge of outside money in political campaigns , the @entity173 and @entity174 governor 's races , a recent visit to @entity176			1
after their futile yelps of " last question ! " and " we got ta go " were ignored over and over again , aides finally dragged the former president away			0
then it was time to meet the voters			0
@entity0 's speech to the sun - drenched crowd , more workmanlike than impassioned , was littered with @entity23 pleasantries and nods to the last campaign , including her opening line : " @entity23 ! i 'm back ! " she lavished praise on @entity15 and , after a warm - up that included nods to her time as secretary of state and her " constant grandchild watch , " urged the audience to get behind @entity2 's slate of @entity21 candidates			1
her biggest applause lines were about women 's issues -- equal pay and abortion rights -- a departure from the 2008 race in which she avoided focusing on her gender and the history - making nature of candidacy			1
the crowd was firmly in her corner , thanks in large part to the super pac " @entity215 , " which plastered every nook and cranny of the rural setting with " ready " signs and bused in an army of volunteers to collect email addresses and phone numbers from arriving @entity21			0
@entity126 laughingly called the young organizers " @entity226 bunnies			0
" leading in the polls , but ... she leads the early polls here by a wide margin , but there is still fault to be found with @entity126 among @entity2 @entity21			1
conversations reveal that some of them skew more liberal than @entity126 on economic and foreign policy issues			0
others want a fresh face and see the 66 - year - old @entity126 as an avatar of the past			0
and there are those who just say they 'd like to see a competitive race , for the sake of " the process , " even if @entity126 ultimately wins the nomination			0
@entity247 gov. @entity246 has been welcomed warmly during his three visits to the state this year			1
sen. @entity250 , a @entity252 socialist threatening to seek the nomination , also drew respectable crowds during a trip here timed to coincide with the @entity126 show			0
vice president @entity258 will be in @entity259 later this week			1
supporters of progressive @entity262 sen. @entity261 , who promises not to run , ran a booth near the entrance and distributed several hundred t - shirts and bumper stickers			2
@entity267 drove down from @entity268 and decked herself out in " @entity270 " gear , availing herself to any reporter willing to listen			1
" @entity0 is fine , she has done her duty , but she does n't inspire me anymore , " she said			1
" she is aligned with the banking industry			0
but , you know , the @entity21 is behind her			0
" despite her lament , @entity267 said she 'd received many - a - thumbs up during the day			0
' this time , she will make history ' the fields of @entity13 , however , were firmly @entity126 turf on sunday			2
" she was wonderful , " @entity280 , a certified nursing assistant from @entity259 , said after the speech			0
" if she runs , she will be the next president			0
" " @entity0 was a good candidate last time , but sometimes it 's what fate throws at you , and @entity288 was making history , " said @entity282 , a 61 - year old mortgage finance specialist from @entity259			1
" this time she will make history			0
" everyone here -- operative , activist , politician , reporter -- has a theory about why @entity126 finished third in @entity2 in 2008			2
and there are no shortages of bright ideas about how she can perform better in 2016			0
but there is universal agreement from rank - and - file @entity21 that @entity126 has to " touch and feel " @entity300 , listen to them , talk one - on - one and get outside the security and media bubble that surrounds her everywhere she goes			0
she gave that a go , too , working the rope line after her speech for half an hour in the baking sun , signing copies of " @entity307 , " awkwardly posing for selfies and saying thank you to the many people demanding she run for president			1
it was n't a perfect show			0
at times , as her @entity316 detail and her aide @entity314 escorted her along the crowd , she looked like she 'd rather be elsewhere			0
she ignored questions from not - so - friendly crowd members who wanted her to comment on the president 's immigration policy , recovery funds for @entity323 or the @entity326 - @entity325 conflict			1
then it was back to the motorcade			0
but she put in the effort -- and got her first real taste of what 's to come if she decides to do this campaign thing all over again .			2

with @entity34 at her side , @entity0 attends the 37th and final @entity335
the questions on everyone 's mind : will she run , and what did she learn from 2008 ?
@entity0 is *reluctant* to chat it up with reporters , but she gave it a go sunday
while she leads in the polls , other names come up : @entity258 , @entity270 , @entity246
