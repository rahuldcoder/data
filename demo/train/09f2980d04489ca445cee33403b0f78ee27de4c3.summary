-- high - stakes lawsuits , overlapping investigations and a bitter battle over blame are spreading across @entity5 in the wake of a scandal that has rocked the meat industry			2
horse meat was discovered in products that are supposed to be 100 % beef , sold in @entity12 , the @entity13 and @entity14			1
on sunday , a major company under scrutiny called one of its suppliers a " villain " responsible for the fraud			1
the supplier , in turn , insisted it was " fooled " by a subsupplier			1
while authorities say there is no immediate cause for health concerns , the discovery was a new shock to an industry already reeling from a bombshell last month when @entity33 investigators found horse and pig dna in numerous hamburger products			1
the blame chain @entity12 food producer @entity38 has been a focus of the uproar since it announced thursday that it had withdrawn its lasagna from stores as a precaution			2
the products were pulled monday after @entity48 supplier @entity46 raised concerns about the type of meat that was used , @entity44 said			1
@entity38 said a letter from @entity46 dated february 2 informed @entity38 that the contamination may date back to august 2012			1
@entity54 found in hamburgers in @entity13 and @entity33 @entity38 is only one of several companies that receive products from @entity46			1
others include @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , which have recalled some meat products in @entity12 , and @entity64 , which has pulled some products from shelves in @entity13			1
six big @entity48 retailers -- @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 -- said sunday that they were recalling lasagne and other products			1
@entity76 , which oversees @entity38 throughout the @entity78 region , said it has begun legal action against @entity46 and its subsuppliers			1
" we are only at the beginning of our legal process			2
@entity46 will end up in a lot of legal processes going forward , i imagine , " @entity76 ceo @entity84 said sunday in an interview with @entity0			1
" @entity46 is the villain			1
" @entity46 has not responded to @entity0 's requests for comment			1
the company did not answer its phones when @entity0 called repeatedly , and did not respond to an e-mail request for comment			1
but @entity84 told @entity48 news agency @entity94 on sunday that his company had been " fooled " by a @entity48 supplier			1
" we were victims , " he said , according to @entity94			2
@entity46 apparently took its website down , posting a sign that it is " under construction			1
" previously , the site described the company as offering a wide array of products through partners , including major @entity5 retailers			1
@entity109 - crossing investigations probes are under way in @entity14 , @entity12 , and @entity13			2

in a statement , @entity114 said a provider in @entity120 and traders in @entity122 and the @entity123 are part of the chain being probed			0
the @entity126 announced sunday that it is reporting @entity38 to police , which is the standard course of action when products have been sold with the wrong labels			1

" i am determined that we get to the bottom of this and that any wrongdoing discovered is punished , " @entity147 said in a statement			0
prime minister @entity160 weighed in friday on @entity161			0
" this is completely unacceptable -- this is n't about food safety but about proper food labeling and confidence in retailers , " he wrote			1

" " what has happened with @entity46 is a crime , a scandal , " he said in an interview with @entity0			1
@entity177 finds horse meat at @entity5 supplier while @entity38 has begun legal action in @entity12 , @entity14 previously said it will file a legal complaint monday against a @entity183 business that is part of the supply chain			0
it did not name the business publicly			0
" there are two victims in this affair : @entity38 and the consumer , " @entity14 said in a statement			0
the @entity13 arm of @entity38 said it is considering legal action against suppliers as well			0
early results of an internal investigation " strongly suggest " the horse meat contamination of a beef lasagna product " was not accidental , " the company said			2
tests showed up to 100 % horse meat @entity64 said tests on random samples demonstrated that the withdrawn products contained between 30 % and 100 % horse meat			2
" this is completely unacceptable and like other affected companies , we feel angry and let down by our supplier			0
if the label says beef , our customers expect it to be beef			0
" samples of the affected @entity38 lasagna contained between 60 % and 100 % horse meat , according to @entity13 and @entity33 food safety inspectors			0

@entity226 apologized and vowed to make sure it never happens again			0
@entity33 officials blamed ingredients from @entity230			0

the discovery of pig dna in beef products is of particular concern to @entity264 , whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products			2
