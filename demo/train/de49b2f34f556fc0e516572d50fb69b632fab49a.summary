@entity0 , @entity1 -- in an industry dominated by men , leave it to women to come up with the winning idea in a contest to create a concept for a video game about losing one 's virginity			1
two women won a contest this week to create a concept for a video game about losing one 's virginity			1
on wednesday , at the @entity22 here , the two - woman team of @entity20 and @entity21 won the @entity24 with just 36 hours of preparation , while their competitors had weeks to come up with concepts for a game about " your first time			1
" this was the sixth straight year of the design challenge , hosted annually by @entity34 - based game developer @entity33			1
the contestants are generally top - tier game designers like two - time winner and @entity38 and the @entity40 creator @entity41 , @entity43 lead designer @entity42 , or 2008 winner and @entity46 creator @entity45			1
the contestants are generally given several weeks to come up with a concept for a game based on some sort of unusual challenge posed by @entity33			1
past themes have included a game about love , a game based on the poetry of @entity56 , and a game that could win the @entity58			2
" we are in a medium that is just incredibly plastic , " @entity33 said			0
" we can put anything up on the screen ... still , we find every year that most of the money being put into games is put into a relatively narrow ( set of ) genres " that tends to include monsters , dragons , and the like			0
@entity33 added that the purpose of the challenge is " to think about how we can create games that really break away " from what 's been done so many times before			1
sex and autobiography have been constant themes in literature , film , and theater , @entity33 argued , pointing to " @entity79 , " the work of @entity81 , @entity83 's novel , " my name is @entity85 , " and the films of @entity87 and @entity88			2
but while @entity33 touted the widespread historical acceptance of the theme of autobiographical sex , he noted with some dismay that veteran game designer @entity93 , who works for @entity94 and who created the award - winning portal , had originally been slated to be among the contestants but had eventually been pressured by @entity94 to withdraw due to the theme			1
" i 'm saying this as a fan of @entity94 , " @entity33 said , " but i do find it frustrating and disturbing that @entity93 would be pulled from the panel			0
" still , he said , after word got around about @entity93 's withdrawal , @entity105 designer @entity20 and independent developer @entity106 volunteered to step up and compete			1
the two ended up facing off against @entity45 , on hand to defend his crown , and @entity111 lead designer @entity110			0
and in the end , while all three submissions were well - received , the duo of @entity20 and @entity106 were judged by the audience to have very closely beaten out @entity45			1
the two women came up with a concept for " our first times , " and presented it as a two - level game , one level for @entity20 's experience and the other for @entity106 's			1
they imagined a series of mini games that could be played on @entity126 , or possibly on @entity128 's @entity127			1
@entity20 began by explaining that her game would commence with the player having to pick an outfit for a date that was intended to conclude with their deflowering			1
it would have to be the least complicated outfit possible , she said , nothing with zippers that get stuck , or too many buttons or ties			2
then , there would be a mini game in which players would have to shave their legs , making especially sure not to miss the all - important spot " by the knees			1
" next up , dinner , and making sure to remove all the garlic from the meals , something the main character -- clearly a female , since the game was presented from a woman 's perspective -- would have to do because of the general cluelessness of the boyfriend in question			1
the next mini game would revolve around choosing the proper mood music from a selection of @entity162 -- yes , records , since the game would be set in the timeframe of @entity20 's first time			1
and clearly , she said , @entity167 would have to be the choice			0
the penultimate mini game would task the player with " not falling off the top bunk " in a college dorm room , " while the final task would involve flicking off the smirking roommate			2
the @entity106 level also involved a series of mini games that commenced with " driving home from ultimate - frisbee practice " and setting the radio station in a car -- perhaps using the @entity184 dial , she said -- to anything except country music			1
@entity187 would be a stop at a drug store to buy a brand of condoms that does n't terrify you , and then going " back to his place , " and grappling with adjusting the tracking on his " antiquated " vcr			0
being a game concept presented from the woman 's perspective , the next mini game would revolve around " making the first move			1
" and then , afterward , calling the best friend to tell the tale			0
" but you have to be careful , " @entity106 said , " because she 's next to mom and grandma on the speed dial			0
" perhaps given their short notice , the mini-game concepts created by @entity20 and @entity106 were n't very fleshed out , something that was a shame since they seemed to be onto something			2
but the crowd appreciated how much effort they had put into the storyboards they 'd created , and forgave the rudimentary fleshing out of the details			0
@entity45 's concept -- which came in a very close second -- ended up revolving around the idea of moving beyond the awkwardness of fumbling high school attempts at romance			2
but before explaining his final design , he talked at length about the challenges of coming up with a game idea when every possible title was too overtly sexual			0
he said he tried out " where 's dildo , " but discarded it because " it had nothing to do with my autobiography			0
" and then , he thought " about the almost too obvious genre of first - person shooters			0
" he also threw away " @entity248 " -- because it would have " problems that would keep it off the shelf at @entity247 " -- and then almost settled on a beat - matching idea called " @entity243			0
" and , playing off the title of @entity93 's hit game , as well as a popular 2008 film , he said he nearly ended up with " @entity252 , " but " my business people tell me paying licenses for two different ( intellectual properties ) is a non-starter			2
" in the end , he said , he came up with a three - act structure for a game based in the virtual world , @entity258 , where act one involves the awkward era of high school , the second act is the more promising college years and finally , act three , happiness in the form of a series of vignettes including dates , a wedding , and then , home life			1
the game , he said , would be called , " wait , time passes			0
" " no matter how picked on you are , " @entity45 said , " this too shall pass			0
your time will come , and you will find happiness and your place in the world			0
" of the six @entity283 , this year 's felt the most wanting for detail and working game mechanics			2
that may have been because the contestants ' task of building something autobiographical did n't meld well with game design			0
still , the crowd , which was heavy with game designers , appreciated the efforts and shouted out their support for all three contestants			0
after all , in the end , the point was to take a particularly challenging game design topic and create something that could plausibly be a working title			2
and who would know better the difficulties of doing so than a room full of game designers ? Â© 2009 @entity305 all rights reserved			0
