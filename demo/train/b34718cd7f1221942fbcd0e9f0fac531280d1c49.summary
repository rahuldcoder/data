-- as the country continues to debate police accountability and the all - too - routine killing of unarmed black men by white law enforcement , it 's imperative to understand that this issue is not just about black people and white people			1
in fact , despite the available statistical evidence , most people do n't know that @entity13 are most likely to be killed by police , compared with other racial groups			1
native americans make up about 0.8 % of the population , yet account for 1.9 % of police killings			1
when @entity13 are shot and killed by law enforcement , there 's rarely much news coverage of those incidents			1
there are no outcries from any community other than our own			2
there are no white or black faces rallying around us , marching with us , protesting with us over this injustice			1
why ? because we are a forgotten people			1
take @entity32 - hi - vist @entity31 , an 18 - year - old @entity34 and @entity35 youth , who died on december 21 , 2013 , after being shot seven times by two sheriff 's deputies in @entity40			1
the two @entity42 deputies alleged that @entity31 had a knife during an incident at his parents ' home in the city of @entity49			1
@entity51 's spokesman @entity50 said @entity52 threw a knife at the deputies and then attacked with another knife			0
they tried a taser on him , which had no effect			0
but @entity52 's girlfriend , @entity59 , who was present when he was killed , said in a statement that @entity52 had no weapons when the two white deputies opened fire			1
" he [ had ] his arms up and his hands were free ... he had no weapons , " she said			0
@entity52 was diagnosed in ninth grade with @entity68 -- a malady affecting 20 % of boys			0
his mother , @entity71 , said he experienced an episode when he thought that his girlfriend was breaking up with him that fateful night			0
the attorney for the @entity52 family , @entity75 , said the @entity76 has refused to release the police report regarding the incident			2
" withholding an official police report ... i think that 's a violation of the @entity82 , " @entity75 told me when i reached out to him			2
@entity52 's mother , @entity71 , said she ca n't comprehend why mainstream media does not report on the killings of unarmed @entity13 , and why the killing of her son has failed to spark a national response			1
" our 18 - year - old son was murdered -- [ shot ] seven times , once in the back of the head , " she said			2
" this [ incident ] in itself should initiate an outrage among those who value life			0
" but the outrage is n't to be found -- at least not outside of @entity102 communities			2
what 's hard to believe is that the two white deputies both received the @entity105 and one received the @entity107 by his department months after @entity52 's death			2
on the @entity42 sheriff 's office facebook page , a post said the awards were in " recognition of their performance above and beyond the call of duty while disregarding their own personal safety and exhibiting exceptional courage in a life threatening situation , stemming from a domestic call they responded to in december of 2013 ... " it is notable that medals were given to the two white deputies in a county named for the infamous murderer and @entity129 fighter @entity128 no less			0
imagine if @entity130 or @entity131 received commendations associated with the killing of @entity134 and @entity135			0
there would be protests dwarfing any that have occurred to date			0
but giving out medals after the killing of a @entity102 ? that does n't seem to bother anyone but @entity13			1
history provides various unjust examples			0
just think of the 20 @entity146 cavalrymen who were awarded the @entity105 after they indiscriminately murdered an estimated 300 @entity147 -- 200 of whom were women and children -- during the @entity151 on december 29 , 1890			0
those medals have yet to be rescinded			0
could it be that @entity154 and pop culture have made dead @entity129 and the killing of the " savages " too commonplace for people to flinch ? many old @entity160 movies from @entity154 did n't portray @entity13 in a positive light			1
contemporary designers such as @entity163 continue to sell clothes with images of dead @entity129 emblazoned on them			0
we 've all seem them -- it 's the image of a skull donning a feather headdress			0
there 's another incident recently that outraged the @entity102 community			0
on october 4 in @entity174 , @entity175 , four officers surrounded an irate 70 - pound @entity177 girl and tased her after concern that she would harm herself with a knife			2
though this outrageous incident was covered by @entity0 and other networks , the killing of @entity31 and many other @entity13 who 've died at the hands of law enforcement remains unspoken			1
is the message here that geography matters in cases of injustice and oppression ? had @entity31 been killed in a major city rather than in @entity49 , @entity40 , would the country have rallied in protest to his brutal death ? after a grand jury in @entity198 , @entity199 , failed to indict @entity200 , the white police officer who killed @entity135 , an unarmed black man , the hashtag # @entity196 immediately grew in popularity			1
utilizing the hashtag , users compared instances of white people receiving little or no punishments for crimes they had committed , whereas african - americans were dealt harshly disproportionate sentences for theirs			1
yet some people want to claim that we 've grown much as a nation			2
really ? on the day when white law enforcement officers are indicted for the killing of unarmed black men , and on the day when white men stop receiving medals associated with the killing of @entity13 , then i will say we 've grown as a nation , but only a little			1
we will still have a long way to go .			0
