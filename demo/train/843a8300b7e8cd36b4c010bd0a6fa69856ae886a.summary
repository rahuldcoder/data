she met a legendary boxing promoter at a fundraiser that was held down the hall from a wedding			1
and she crossed paths with an uber - @entity10 moneyman at a dinner with 900 of @entity13 's biggest philanthropists and donors , where @entity15 was presented with a pair of " running " shoes			1
all in an odd days work for @entity15 as she tours the nation for a combination of paid and political speaking engagements			2
@entity15 ended her night keynoting a fundraiser for the @entity23 , where the former secretary of state collected a $ 225,000 paycheck for a speech that touted the need for more access to higher education			1
@entity15 : ' is that a marijuana plant ? ' " more needs to be done , " @entity15 said of making higher education available			1
" higher education should n't be a privilege for those able to afford it			0
it should be an opportunity widely available for anyone with the talent and determination and ambition to learn			0

@entity45 , who was honored on monday for his $ 7 million commitment to @entity49 's hotel college , dished out millions of dollars to @entity10 presidential hopefuls in 2012 and is expected to do the same in 2016			1
@entity45 and @entity15 met backstage before the former first lady 's speech and , according to @entity15 , joked about their differences			1
" @entity45 said to me ' @entity59 , i wish they paired me with you to ask the questions , we could have a really ( good ) debate , " @entity15 said to laughs from the audience			1
@entity15 was n't exactly effusive in honoring @entity45 's donation to @entity49 at the top of her speech , though			1
while she heralded others work for @entity49 , she said the casino magnate 's " work in this community ... was also honored " tonight			0
@entity15 's message , like during most speeches , struck a bipartisan tone			2
" i think it is time we get back to working together again , " @entity15 said			2

" @entity15 was also interviewed on stage monday by @entity86 , the publisher of the @entity88 and @entity15 's college roommate			2
@entity86 , who referred to @entity15 as a " friend " on stage , kicked off their conversation by presenting @entity15 with a pair of running shoes			2
the newspaper publisher was clear to point out that his wife bought the shoes " in the section that said running shoes , " a reference to @entity15 's likely run for the presidency in 2016			2
@entity15 's appearance at @entity49 was controversial when it was announced over the summer because the university foundation was paying @entity15 at the same time that tuition was being raised for students			2
on monday , event organizers argued that the fee was worth it because the event would raise more money than the foundation would spend			0
@entity15 started the day in @entity115 , where she headlined a closed fundraiser for sen. @entity118 , who is running for re-election			2

as for whether he supports @entity15 running for president in 2016 , @entity151 would not say , though he did say she " would be a fighter from the womb to the tomb			1
