@entity10 recounted the incident monday , saying she and her husband headed to @entity26 , which straddles the @entity3 - @entity6 border , that day to " enjoy a day on the lake			1
" the two decided to ride their personal watercraft to the @entity6 side of the lake to see a historical church there , she said			2
but she said the couple was confronted by three boats , and gunmen aboard began firing shots at them when they tried to flee the area			2

she said she had to pass the three boats while attempting to get back to the @entity3 side of the lake			1

" the boats chased me pretty much all the way to the @entity3 border or past it , " she said			0
@entity61 's body has not been found , despite extensive searches by both @entity3 and @entity6 authorities			1
@entity64 , spokesman for the @entity3 @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity6 , said saturday that @entity10 is " fully cooperating in assisting @entity6 prosecutors with their investigation			1
" her friday interview with officials from the federal attorney general 's office and prosecutors from @entity6 's @entity73 state was held in the @entity75 field office in @entity17			1
it took place the day after @entity6 authorities said they were suspending the search for @entity61			2
" @entity6 authorities told the @entity3 consulate that the suspension of the search was only temporary and would continue at a later date , " @entity64 said			2
" we are going to hold them to that			0
" @entity10 's mother , @entity87 , said earlier that she , @entity10 and the woman 's father met with @entity6 and @entity3 officials friday , and the family was told that the @entity6 government was " restrategizing " how it was handling the search for @entity10 's body			1
@entity10 met with @entity95 , the lead @entity6 investigator in the death of her husband , days before @entity99 was killed			1
his severed head was delivered to authorities in a suitcase last week			2
however , authorities vowed to continue to search			2
on friday , @entity73 state attorney general spokesman @entity104 said the suspension was a " temporary recess so that we can better assess the strategies we are using to find the body			0
" responding to local reports that threats of imminent gun battles by the @entity114 drug cartel might have led officials to suspend the search , @entity104 said , " @entity117			0
" @entity118 , @entity18 , sheriff @entity119 has said @entity6 authorities may have been trying to intimidate @entity10 during the in - depth interview friday and scare her into not pushing them to continue the investigation			1
but @entity10 denied that monday , saying authorities just wanted detailed information about the day -- " where we had stopped and who we talked to , that kind of thing			1
i did n't feel like it was an interrogation , and i really hope they do continue the search and continue their investigation			2
" she said she did not get a sense that authorities were questioning her account			2
" we just want @entity15 back , " @entity10 said			1
" ... i think they do want to find whoever , but ultimately i do n't really care if they find the person because i know in time , they 'll have their day [ of judgment ]			0
" a report issued by a @entity18 - based think tank last week suggested that @entity10 's death may have stemmed from a case of mistaken identity in the ongoing war between two @entity6 drug cartels			1
the @entity150 report , which cites anonymous sources , noted that @entity61 worked for an oil and gas company with operations in @entity154 , @entity6			0

the truck they drove to @entity26 on september 30 still had a license plate from @entity73 state			0
the couple drove their personal watercraft to the @entity165 area of the lake , which the report said is a " known battleground in the ongoing war in the @entity114 and @entity170 cartels			0
" the sources told @entity150 both cartels have been known to conduct surveillance and countersurveillance operations on personal watercraft , so @entity114 scouts identified them as possible @entity170 spies , because of their license plate and their method and direction of travel on @entity26			0
they were then apparently confronted by " @entity114 enforcers , " @entity150 said			0
the sources told @entity150 the attack was unauthorized by senior @entity114 members and " a damage control campaign is currently under way ... to identify and eliminate those who engaged the @entity188 without proper authorization			0
" protocol involves prompt disposition of a body to ensure no evidence can be brought against the group , the report said			0
@entity196 is about 70 miles west of the @entity188 ' home in @entity17			0
