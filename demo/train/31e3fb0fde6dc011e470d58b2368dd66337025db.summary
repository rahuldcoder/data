-- as @entity2 demonstrates , adults love playing dress up just as much as children			2
the only difference between junior and senior would - be masters - of - disguise is that kids do n't need an excuse to don a costume ; grown - ups , however , seem to feel more comfortable when there 's a theme involved			1
in the market for an outfit to match your fetish ? with @entity19 on the horizon , we 've rounded up some of the craziest costumed events out there			2
getting geeky with it self - proclaimed ( and a few closeted ) nerds will find no shortage of events catering to the dweebiest of whims			0
though it faces some stiff competition ( the @entity29 , which encourages participants to dress as their favorite alien , could give it a run for its money ) , @entity28 is arguably the dorkiest event on the calendar			0
the @entity36 variant is not only the original , it is also the biggest comic - related convention			0
last year heralded in over 130,000 visitors , with costumes ranging from @entity43 characters to comic super heroes and even the odd @entity46 princess			0
as it has become an ' it ' event for any @entity50 franchise wishing to build a cult - following ( and there 's a lot of them ) , @entity28 has even managed to make the geek a little bit chic over the years , with a-list celebs showing up in costume too			1
@entity58 fans of @entity60 should head to @entity61 to take part in one of the largest masked festivals on @entity65			1
during @entity66 , the " city without streets " takes on an especially surreal vibe as thousands of tourists join the locals in donning elaborate masks and gowns for ten days of celebrations			0
though @entity66 's roots date back to the @entity77 , the modern version has only been active since the ' 70s ( blame @entity78 , who put an end to the fun when he invaded in 1797 )			1
the city 's @entity81 becomes mobbed with tourists and photographers , who snap pics of professionals strutting their stuff in ornate robes and those creepy , bird - like masks the city is famous for			1
time travelers delight at the @entity92 , which runs every weekend throughout april and may , the 242,000 annual visitors are prone to dress in period outfits			1
the festival is set in 1533 , the year @entity94 married @entity96			1
general manager @entity97 says that historically , during a royal wedding , the king and queen would tour all the villages in their realm			0
he notes that such an event makes a handy motif for a gathering dedicated to outrageous costumes			1
" of course , anytime the king comes to town , it 's a good time to spruce up , put on your finest , and put on a good show , " he says			1
though the professional performers are held to a high standard , with costume guards making sure no detail is out of place , for everyone else , it 's a free for all			1

we have a whole selection of musketeers			0
even though they 're a couple hundred years off , they 're more than welcome , " he says			2
the @entity133 are coming ! the @entity134 in the @entity135 is home to the world 's largest fire festival , @entity139 , which also happens to be a holdover from @entity142 times			1
as such , the event is celebrated with a procession of 1,000 " guizers " , or men in @entity142 costume , making their way through the town of @entity150 until they reach the @entity152 , where they then toss lit torches into a @entity142 long ship			0
though dressing up is mainly reserved for locals , anyone is invited to witness the event			0
last year , 5,000 onlookers cheered the helmeted mass as they readied themselves to take down another ship			0
unleash the dark lovers of the macabre will do well to visit @entity165 , @entity166 during the annual @entity167 , aka , the @entity168			0
the costumes are remarkably diverse ; futuristic robots are as much the norm as darkly - clad , @entity173 romantics			0
the one thing that seems to unify the 20,000 participants , however , is an affection for @entity177 ( which just happens to be very varied )			0
" in the last few years , new music styles have developed within the scene			0
in many cases , fashion is connected to that specialist taste , which is why there 's such a range , " explains @entity180 , the festival organizer			1
wo n't you join the ( blue ) ball ? in 1995 , the small town of @entity189 , @entity190 ( population 1,470 ) became an unintentional symbol for cryogenics			1
a few years earlier , the body of @entity196 citizen @entity195 was shipped out to the town to live stored in a frozen state in the home of his daughter , @entity200			2
when she was evicted for living in a house without electricity or plumbing , she went to the local press in the hopes of salvaging her father 's remains			2

in 2002 , the town decided to commemorate the event with @entity220 , an annual three - day homage to corpses and cold			1
" we 're a very small mountain town , and it 's hard to eke out a living			2
the @entity229 was like , ' well , we 're known as the town with the frozen dead guy , so let 's have a festival , ' " explains @entity228 , the event organizer			1
highlights of the fete include a coffin race , hearse parade , costume polar plunge and the @entity239 -- a necro - themed costume party			1
