@entity0 , @entity1 -- conflicting accounts emerged thursday over whether the extremist group @entity4 has signaled a desire to negotiate with @entity1 amid a @entity1 military offensive targeting the group			1
" they want to talk , " said a @entity1 official who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to talk to the media			1
a spokesman for the @entity1 government , however , disputed that account and said @entity1 would n't talk with @entity4 even if the group did want to negotiate			1
" @entity4 has not contacted @entity1 in any way , " said the spokesman , @entity15			1
" there are no plans whatsoever for @entity1 to negotiate with @entity4			2
@entity1 does not negotiate with outlawed groups			2
" he said @entity1 troops have enjoyed success since crossing the border into @entity24 to pursue @entity4 , which the @entity25 and several @entity27 nations view as a terrorist organization			1
" they are running scared			0
i think they are busy running for their lives , " @entity15 said			0
" they do n't have time to talk			0
" @entity1 troops struck several @entity4 training sites in @entity24 early thursday , a military spokesman said			1
the militant group , which includes many rival factions with different leaders , operates from @entity24			2
the group 's leaders were said to be reaching out for possible negotiations two weeks after @entity1 troops stormed into @entity24 to hunt for @entity4 , which @entity1 blames for recent kidnappings of foreigners in the nation			1
but sheikh @entity45 , @entity4 's second - in - command who is also known as @entity50 , told supporters protesting in @entity52 against the @entity1 incursion that if @entity1 struck targets in @entity24 , the militant group would strike back			1
@entity1 has said its forces aim to take the @entity24 port city of @entity56 , described by the @entity57 as a key stronghold and source of cash for @entity4			1
the @entity57 estimates the group collects up to $ 50 million a year from businesses in @entity56 , about half of its annual income			0
@entity65 urged what he said were @entity4 - trained fighters in @entity1 to take action in return , with the @entity1 port of @entity71 a target			1
'' carry out attacks with heavy losses on @entity1 , " @entity65 said			0
" if @entity1 closes the sea port in @entity56 , attack its banks , its port , its foreign guests and wherever there is a high - value target			0
" @entity1 officials have declared self - defense justifies crossing the border with @entity24 , saying a recent spate of abductions threatened its security and constituted an attack			2
kidnappers have seized two aid workers and two @entity91 tourists in the past month			0
" we have looked at what is going on ... and decided that unless we move in now , @entity4 is not diminishing , it is becoming bigger and bigger , " @entity15 said			0
the war on terror can not be won without dismantling the group 's power , he said			0
efforts to flush out the terror group will take a " couple of months , if that , " @entity15 said , adding that " weeks " would be a more ideal time frame			0
analysts and diplomats have raised concerns over the incursion , saying it gives the terror group a reason to strike @entity1			1
" if there is anything we have learned in the last couple of decades is that foreign intervention , especially military intervention , does n't work in @entity24 , " said @entity110 , an analyst for @entity111			0
" i definitely understand @entity1 's anxiety about the terror threat emanating from @entity24 ... but i think there is more that @entity1 could have done inside the country			2
" while noting @entity1 's " right to defend itself , " the @entity25 @entity122 in @entity0 said it was not part of the decision to send troops to @entity24			2
" the @entity25 did not encourage the @entity1 government to act nor did @entity1 seek our views , " said @entity128 , the embassy 's press officer			1
" we note that @entity1 has a right to defend itself against threats to its security and its citizens			0
" @entity24 president @entity136 thanked @entity1 on wednesday for helping battle the extremist group two days after he accused the nation of overstepping its boundaries			2
