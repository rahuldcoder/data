-- the @entity2 caucus is tuesday and so far , this shaky bunch of challengers has done a better job of telling us why @entity7 should not be re-elected than telling us why they would be any better			1
and yet , one of these candidates must be declared the winner , which is a big reason why 70 % of @entity13 want the election to be over even before it officially begins			1
yeah , a lot of voters have already made up their minds based upon party affiliation , but i believe most @entity13 dread being manipulated for 10 more months by an onslaught of isolated statistics , abbreviated facts and slick campaign ads. we 're sick of the bull -- but it seems you have to be knee deep in it in to vote , and covered head - to - toe to run			1
which is why politics is dirty and @entity33 stinks			0
remember when then - sen. @entity7 promised to change all that ? sure the cantankerous tea party did n't help , but really we knew that " hope and change " was n't going to happen shortly after questions about his faith began to dog him in 2007 and voters wondered if he was a @entity45			1
the president @entity7 promised to be would have said , " this is @entity13 , where we have freedom of religion and the fact that this is being used as a way to characterize me as unfit to be president is not only religious bigotry , it 's unconstitutional and un-american			1
" however , the politically savvy candidate handled such rumors by reiterating he was a @entity58 , which left many dissatisfied because he played the game almost as soon as he promised not to			0
which is why the compromises he 's made over the past three years should not come as a surprise			0
that does n't make him a bad president or a bad person			1
it just makes him a politician			0
and while the message of his first campaign hypnotized many to believe he was n't , the reality is the word " politician " is in every sentence of the president of the @entity13 ' job description			1
so for all of you folks in @entity2 as well as @entity84 and @entity85 who are jazzed up over the piety of @entity87 , business smarts of @entity89 or the whatever of whomever , keep this in mind : the question in national politics is n't which candidate is best suited to lead but rather which candidate is going to mislead the least , because they all do it			2
a cursory glance at the record and statements of the @entity103 candidates as well as president @entity7 shows a heap of flip - flops			1
beltway bipartisanship , which does not reflect a politician 's ability to get along with the folks across the aisle but rather the propensity for @entity112 and @entity103 to say , do and vote however they think they need to stay in the building			0
i do n't regret voting for @entity7 , especially considering that sen. @entity121 's way of playing the game could have resulted in putting @entity123 within a heartbeat of the presidency , but i would n't classify myself as an @entity7 supporter either			1
i 'm not a supporter of any politician or party , for that matter			0
i 'm a supporter of ideas			0
i 'm a supporter of principles , none of which should be dumbed down to religious practices , contingent on polls or assigned to a specific party because at the end of the day , they 're after one thing : self preservation			2
" what 's best for the country ? " is really just a campaign slogan			0
for example , the @entity147 - controlled 111th @entity146 can rewrite history any way they want , but voters can see they did not pass a comprehensive budget in 2009 because they did not want to make decisions that could be used against @entity112 up for re-election in 2010			0
this is also the reason why the @entity146 waited until after the midterm election to overturn " do n't ask , do n't tell			1
" or look how the professorial @entity157 told us @entity159 would be a good president , even though we all witnessed @entity159 struggle to talk intelligently about @entity161 , @entity162 or even huge chunks of the @entity13			1
@entity87 massaged his stance on abortion and endorsement of @entity89 in 2008 once he decided to run for president himself			2
@entity169 called the stimulus package a failure while neglecting to talk about how he used stimulus money to balance his state 's budget and create the jobs he talks so much about			0
meanwhile , @entity89 , who made millions in no small part by laying off thousands of @entity13 for a living , calls himself a job creator			1
i do n't even think @entity180 would have tried a @entity182 mind trick like that			2
and yet there he is and here they are : our choices for 2012			0
i do n't know about you but all i want is a stronger economy and not to be blown up by @entity189 or a crazy guy with a bomb sewn into his tighty - whities			2
seems like a simple request but as we all know , there 's very little about running a country with more than 300 million people and the world 's largest economy that is simple			0
or from the look of things , honest			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2

@entity203 : 70 % of @entity13 wish the election was over
he says people are n't looking forward to 10 months of manipulative ads and pitches
politicians from president @entity7 on down compromise principles for political gain , he says
@entity203 : what gets lost in the battle ? the best *interests* of the nation
