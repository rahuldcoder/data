@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 government wants to find out what makes people happy			0
is it good health , education , income , or job satisfaction ? is it the environment , a lack of crime , or having a say in politics ? those aspects of life ca n't be measured by the gross domestic product ( gdp ) , long used as a key indicator of a nation 's prosperity , @entity4 prime minister @entity18 says			1
thursday , he launched a national survey to ask people which aspects matter most to them , and which they believe should be used to measure the nation 's well - being			1
though @entity18 has championed this initiative since at least 2006 , when he was still leader of the opposition -- suggesting a focus on @entity34 , or " general well - being " -- he still defended the idea thursday against suspicions " that all this is a bit airy - fairy and impractical			1
" " of course you ca n't capture happiness on a spreadsheet any more than you can bottle it , " he said in announcing the program			0
" if anyone was trying to reduce the whole spectrum of human emotion into one snapshot statistic , i would be the first to roll my eyes , but that is n't what this is about			0
" just as the gdp figures do n't give the full story of our economy 's growth , but do give a useful indicator of where we 're heading , so this new measure wo n't give the full story of our nation 's well - being , but will give us a general picture of how life is improving			1
" an online survey for individuals will run until april , when the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) will send out surveys to large households			0
the results of both will be collected and analyzed , with results to come out in 2012 , the @entity66 said			0
@entity18 said he knows some think the project is a " distraction " from the more urgent economic problems @entity4 must address , and that some think there is no way the government can hope to improve people 's well - being			1
getting the economy moving , and creating jobs and spreading opportunity , is still the government 's most urgent priority , @entity18 said -- but there need to be better ways than just gdp to assess the country 's growth and progress			1
" when a country is hit by an earthquake , that can increase gdp because of the extra spending on reconstruction afterwards , " he said			0
" when a city is torn apart by crime and disorder , that can increase gdp because of all the extra locks and security people buy			2
when a person falls seriously ill , that can increase gdp because the cost of buying drugs and paying for care counts as economic activity			2
" initiatives regarded as good for growth sometimes have negative effects on the quality of life , he said -- such as loose controls on immigration , which can affect public services , or cheap prices on alcohol that can lead to more incidents of crime			0
" it 's because of this fundamentally flawed approach that for decades @entity124 societies have seen the line of gdp rising steadily upwards , but at the same time , levels of contentment have remained static or even fallen , " @entity18 said			1
@entity18 said government ca n't legislate for fulfillment or satisfaction , but it can boost well - being by finding out what will improve lives and then acting on it			2
" in time it will lead to government policy that is more focused not just on the bottom line , but on all those things that make life worthwhile , " he said .			0
