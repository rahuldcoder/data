@entity0 is suing the @entity2 government in an effort to loosen restrictions on what the social media giant can say publicly about the national security - related requests it receives for user data			1
the company filed a lawsuit against the @entity11 on monday in a federal court in northern @entity13 , arguing that its first amendment rights are being violated by restrictions that forbid the disclosure of how many national security letters and @entity18 court orders it receives -- even if that number is zero			2
@entity0 vice president @entity20 wrote in a blog post that it 's suing in an effort to publish the full version of a " transparency report " prepared this year that includes those details			2
the @entity28 - based firm was unsatisfied with the @entity11 's move in january to allow technological firms to disclose the number of national security - related requests they receive in broad ranges			0
" it 's our belief that we are entitled under the @entity37 to respond to our users ' concerns and to the statements of @entity2 government officials by providing information about the scope of @entity2 government surveillance -- including what types of legal process have not been received , " @entity20 wrote			1
" we should be free to do this in a meaningful way , rather than in broad , inexact ranges			0
" but a @entity11 spokeswoman pointed to the january move -- which was aimed at mollifying complaints from tech giants like @entity54 and @entity55 -- as evidence that the government is allowing the release of at least some information on its surveillance activities			1
" earlier this year , the government addressed similar concerns raised in a lawsuit brought by several major tech companies , " department spokeswoman @entity61 said			0
" there , the parties worked collaboratively to allow tech companies to provide broad information on government requests while also protecting national security			0
" critics of the @entity2 government 's secrecy surrounding its national security surveillance activities lauded @entity0 's move			1
@entity76 , the @entity77 's deputy legal director , said " challenging this tangled web of secrecy rules and gag orders " was the right move , and he urged other tech firms to follow @entity0 's lead			0
" if these laws prohibit @entity0 from disclosing basic information about government surveillance , then these laws violate the @entity37 , " @entity76 said			1
" the @entity88 does n't permit the government to impose so broad a prohibition on the publication of truthful speech about government conduct			0
