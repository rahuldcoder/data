" we learn something new each day			0
i had no idea a gift like this could be seen as anything other than positive : in the @entity3 a watch is precious - because nothing is more important than time , " she later said in a statement			1
but the recipient , mayor @entity37 , also came under fire for his " rude " response			2
@entity37 , who was recently elected and is n't a career politician , told reporters that he had " no use " for the pocket watch			1
" i can just regift it to someone or take it to a scrap metal dealer and sell it for cash , " he was quoted as saying			0
