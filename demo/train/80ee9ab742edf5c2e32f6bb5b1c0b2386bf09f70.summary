two - thirds of those surveyed in a recent @entity5 poll said they consider the @entity6 in @entity7 and @entity8 to be a " major threat " to this country			1
but are such fears really justified ? despite the impression you may have had from listening to @entity0 officials in recent weeks , the answer is probably not really			2
for a start , @entity0 officials have been inflating the numbers of @entity0 fighting for @entity1 , which has muddied the issue for the public			1
@entity0 secretary of defense @entity20 , for example , told @entity22 's @entity21 earlier this month , " we are aware of over 100 @entity0 citizens who have @entity0 passports who are fighting in the @entity26 with @entity1 forces			1
" ( @entity1 is sometimes referred to as @entity1 and now calls itself the @entity6 )			0
but the @entity28 soon corrected @entity30 's comment , saying the 100 count is the total number of @entity0 fighting for any of the various groups fighting in @entity8 , some of which are more militant than others -- and some of which are even allied with the @entity0 indeed , @entity38 , the director of the @entity39 -- the government office tasked with assessing terrorist threats -- also confirmed that 100 is the total count of the various @entity0 fighting in @entity8 and not a count of those fighting for @entity1			1
@entity30 's comment is only the latest inflated claim regarding the number of @entity0 fighting with @entity1			1
last week , the @entity47 cited anonymous official sources who said there are 300 @entity0 fighting with @entity1 , despite the @entity28 estimating the figure to be more like a dozen			1
who is the @entity1 ? true , a dozen is still too many			0
but it is important to remember that just because these @entity0 are fighting with @entity1 , it does n't necessarily translate into a significant threat to the @entity0 homeland			1
one need only look at the example of @entity60 to see why			0
@entity61 : when @entity0 leave for jihad the last sizeable group of @entity0 who went overseas to fight with an @entity66 - aligned group are the 29 americans known to have traveled to fight with the @entity60 terrorist group @entity68 after the 2006 invasion of @entity60 by the @entity71 army			2
however , none of those 29 subsequently planned or conducted a terrorist attack inside the @entity0 , according to a survey of more than 240 jihadist terrorism cases since september 11 conducted by the @entity76			0
what can the @entity0 do against @entity1 and could it work ? indeed , for more than a third of the @entity0 militants who fought with @entity68 , going to @entity60 was a one - way ticket			1
in 2008 , a missile strike in @entity60 killed @entity82 , a resident of @entity83			0
a year later , @entity84 , a 17 - year - old from @entity85 , was killed in the @entity60 capital , @entity87			0
@entity88 , @entity84 's uncle , reportedly said at the time , " we believe he was killed because he would have been a key person in the investigation into the recruitment ( of young @entity60 men ) here in @entity85			0
" @entity68 militants also are said to have killed @entity96 native @entity95 , who joined the group in 2006 and took a high - profile position in its media operations before his death last year			0
at least two @entity0 fighting for @entity68 died while conducting suicide attacks in @entity60			1
@entity102 , a 26 - year - old from @entity103 , became the first known @entity0 to conduct a suicide bombing for an @entity66 - associated group when he drove a car packed with bombs into a government compound on october 28 , 2008			0
in 2011 , meanwhile , the @entity109 confirmed that @entity110 , a 27 - year - old @entity103 man who was born in @entity60 and moved to the @entity0 at age 12 , was killed while attempting to detonate a suicide bomb in @entity60			2
@entity61 : an @entity0 's gateway to jihad in addition to the @entity0 militants who died in @entity60 , six were arrested , four when they returned to the @entity119 and two in @entity121			2
@entity122 , a 28 - year - old @entity85 man who traveled to @entity60 and attended an @entity68 training camp before returning to the @entity0 , was arrested and in 2009 pleaded guilty to supporting @entity68			2
in another case , @entity124 , an @entity0 resident who helped organize @entity68 's recruitment pipeline and visited a training camp , was arrested in the @entity128 in 2009			0
@entity95 was extradited to the @entity0 and in 2012 was convicted on terrorism charges			0
of course , the fact that 13 of the 29 @entity0 militants who fought in @entity60 remain at large is a reminder that the @entity133 and @entity109 also need to pay attention to the potential threat posed by @entity0 foreign fighters in @entity8			2
but this is no reason for @entity0 officials to overhype the threat posed by @entity1 to the @entity0			1
yes , @entity0 should always be mindful of the threats posed by extremists			0
but as the case of @entity0 citizens in @entity60 suggests , @entity8 could very well end up being a graveyard for @entity0 fighting there rather than a launch pad for attacks on the @entity0 .			1

two - thirds of @entity0 say @entity1 " major threat " to @entity0
@entity0 officials have inflated numbers of @entity0 fighting for @entity1 , says @entity153
claims that over 100 @entity0 citizens fighting with @entity1 are probably *overestimate*
@entity60 example suggests those fighting in @entity8 wo n't pose @entity0 threat , @entity153 says
