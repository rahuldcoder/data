is now looking at scorching - hot @entity8 for its next mission			2
the innermost planet of our solar system orbits so close to the @entity13 that , in some instances , surface temperature surpasses 400 ° @entity16 of the planet without sunlight , on the other hand , can become as cold as -170 ° @entity20 no other planet has variations in temperature so severe			1
the reason for this is the absence of any significant atmosphere , which @entity8 is too hot and too small to retain			2
with a diameter of just over 3,000 miles , it 's just a third larger than the @entity30 , and smaller than two other moons in the solar system -- @entity36 's @entity34 and @entity35 's @entity33			0
@entity6 's mission to @entity8 will tentatively launch on 21 july 2016 , to reach @entity8 's orbit seven and a half years later , in 2024			1
the spacecraft is called @entity40 -- in honor of @entity44 space pioneer @entity42			0
@entity8 is the least studied of the inner planets , but it has many peculiarities			0
" @entity8 is special , " said @entity47 , the project scientist in charge of the @entity40 mission , " it 's the densest planet in our solar system , even denser than @entity5 - if we consider uncompressed density - and has a magnetic field , like @entity5 , that no one expected before , so i guess it 's a cool planet to go to			1
" there are many challenging aspects to a mission to @entity8 , most prominently its proximity to the @entity13 , with its mighty gravitational pull and intense radiation			1
the planet 's high orbital velocity of 48 kilometers per second -- compared to @entity5 's 30 kilometers per second -- is also an issue			0
any probe en route to @entity8 must not only cover an average linear distance of 48 million miles , but carefully gauge its velocity so that it can catch the fast planet 's orbit without getting sucked into the @entity13 's gravitational well			1
as a result , only two missions have visited @entity8 so far			0
the first was @entity77 's @entity76 , launched in 1973			0
this was the first spacecraft to use the " gravitational slingshot " technique , which uses a planet 's gravity to affect the trajectory and the speed of a spacecraft , saving on fuel and time			0
@entity42 's calculations were used to plot @entity76 's trip to @entity8 , in a maneuver that has been widely used in space exploration ever since			2
the second mission is still underway : it 's called @entity93 and it was launched -- again by @entity77 -- in 2004			0
it is currently orbiting the planet and will continue to study it well into 2015			0
nevertheless , @entity6 feels that there is enough mystery about @entity8 to warrant a third mission			1
" messenger found so many surprising , unexpected results that we have a lot of good reasons to follow - up on what they did , " @entity47 told @entity7 , " it 's a huge benefit that we have this mission in that stage , because only ten years later we will be at @entity8 , follow - up on what @entity93 did and get a huge , wonderful exploration of this planet			1
" the mission will , once again , use gravity assists to reach its destination : it will first complete a fly - by of @entity5 , essentially returning to our planet two years after launch			2
then it will perform two fly - bys of @entity121 , before finally heading toward @entity8			0
upon arrival , a module called @entity124 ( @entity124 ) will separate from the rest of the spacecraft and perform a detailed study of the @entity8 system			0
this module is designed by the @entity130 , which jointly conducts the mission along with @entity6			2
@entity40 will help us understand how planets can form so close to their parent star , and will analyze @entity8 's geology and magnetic field			1
it will also provide further confirmation of @entity139 's general theory of relativity			1
@entity8 's strange orbital pattern first puzzled physicists in 1845 , when it was discovered that it did not conform to @entity144 's theory of gravity			1
this was later explained by relativity , which revealed that @entity8 's warped orbit was due to curved space and not some unseen object			2
@entity40 will be in an optimal position to gather extremely precise data about the planet 's dance around the @entity13 , offering the ultimate validation to @entity139 's idea			1

@entity6 's next mission , @entity40 , will explore the planet closest to the @entity13 , @entity8
the probe will launch in 2016 and reach @entity8 in 2024
it will endure temperatures of *350* degrees @entity20 and observe @entity8 from orbit
the data will be used , among other things , to confirm @entity139 's theory of relativity
