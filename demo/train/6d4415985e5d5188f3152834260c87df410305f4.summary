@entity0 -- huge traffic jams snarled central @entity0 thursday , as @entity5 's first general strike in more than a year kicked off with nine people slightly injured in demonstrations , including police officers , the @entity2 said			1
@entity2 official @entity9 said 58 people had been detained			2
the cause was not immediately clear			0
dozens of union members picketed outside the @entity14 before dawn , with dozens of riot police on hand			2
picketers heckled and momentarily blocked a car trying to get into the ministry			0
@entity5 unions are protesting the new conservative government 's labor reforms and austerity cuts			1
the general strike is the first one against the government of prime minister @entity28 , which was elected in november and took office in december , in the midst of @entity5 's deep economic crisis			1
@entity5 's jobless rate is nearly 23 % overall , and nearly 50 % for youth			1
nearly 5.3 million @entity5 are out of work			1
the @entity36 - leaning @entity35 ( @entity37 ) said there was a " massive following " of the strike nationwide , with auto factories , ports , post offices and garbage collection all stopped by the industrial action			1
the union also said wholesale food markets and large distribution centers for the big supermarket chains were disrupted			2
the @entity2 said public transport was operating almost normally in @entity0 and @entity51 , but in @entity0 's @entity53 , commuters said they waited up to two hours for public transport			1
some bus services which normally run every five minutes had service only every 30 minutes , according to a municipal bus employee who declined to give his name			0
@entity0 's traffic jams lasted beyond the normal rush hour , an indication that commuters who could not get public transport decided to drive in			1
the last general strike , in september 2010 , was against the then - @entity36 government , which also had initiated austerity measures			0
that strike slowed industry and transport , but much of the country went to work and many analysts saw it as a kind of a draw between the government and unions			1
since then , the economic crisis has deepened			0
@entity35 protests across the nation this month and last drew large crowds , which analysts say emboldened the unions to move ahead with a general strike			0
the government says the latest labor reforms are needed to bring flexibility to the workplace and to simplify the rules for employers			0
but unions say the effect will be to make it easier and cheaper to fire workers			0
the unions ' strike theme is : " they want to end labor and social rights and finish off everything			0
" at the @entity106 wholesale fish market , one of the largest in @entity104 , seafood wholesaler @entity100 , who employs 120 people , said before the union action that he does n't think striking is good			1
" it would be better if unions , the government and employers would negotiate and find a solution , " he said			1
@entity35 picketers were expected at the entrance to the sprawling market on @entity0 's south side , but some employees said they planned to work despite the strike			2
" if the boss buys fish and we need to come , we 'll come , " said @entity121 , a worker at the wholesale market			0
" but if the union pickets outside wo n't let us in , we 'll just have to wait , or maybe go home			0
" many other @entity5 , who have already seen their salaries cut or frozen in the economic crisis , were debating whether to strike			2
if they walk out , they will lose a day 's wage , which for government workers could amount to several hundred dollars			0
ahead of the strike , unions and government officials in many , but not all , of @entity5 's 17 regions agreed on minimum services , which generally call for about 30 % of public transportation to run , while public hospitals and other essential services have reduced staff , similar to holiday levels			1
the unions planned 80 demonstrations across the country thursday , mostly in the late afternoon or early evening			0
the strike comes one day before the government unveils its 2012 budget on friday , with the aim of reducing @entity5 's deficit to 5.3 % of gross domestic product this year , and to 3 % next year , to meet @entity151 requirements			1
the government already approved a $ 20 billion ( 15 billion euro ) package of austerity cuts and tax hikes to reduce the deficit , and on friday it is expected to announce a second package of the same size or larger			1
government critics say it will be the first time the government really shows its hand on where to make deep cuts in specific programs and agencies			2
@entity28 , at a recent @entity151 summit , was reported by @entity5 media to be overheard on an open microphone telling another @entity151 leader that the labor reforms would cost him a general strike			2
the reforms were approved first as a decree law , with immediate effect , and the unions called on the government to make amendments as the bill moved through parliament			2
but the conservatives have a commanding majority in parliament and later approved the reforms unchanged			0
the government says the labor reforms make up only a portion of the elements needed to spur an economic recovery			0
it predicts a 1.7 % decline in the economy this year			0
the government also has demanded reforms in the banking sector , with the aim of getting credit flowing again and to clean up the books of lenders stuck with huge uncollectible debts left over from @entity5 's real estate and construction boom that went bust , precipitating the economic crisis .			1
