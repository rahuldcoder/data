-- some children and teens are more likely than their peers to become addicted to the @entity4 , and a new study suggests it 's more likely to happen if kids are depressed , hostile , or have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or social phobia			2
teenagers who use the internet so much that it interferes with everyday life and decision - making may be addicted			2
although an internet addiction is not an official diagnosis , signs of a potential problem include using the internet so much for game playing or other purposes that it interferes with everyday life and decision - making ability			1
( the diagnosis is being considered for the 2012 edition of the @entity25 , the " bible " of mental ailments published by the @entity27 )			0
past research suggests that 1.4 percent to 17.9 percent of adolescents are addicted to the @entity4 , with percentages higher in eastern nations than in @entity33 nations , according to the study published monday in the @entity35			1
the internet as therapy in the survey of 2,293 seventh - grade students in @entity40 , 10.8 percent developed an internet addiction , which was determined by a high score on an internet addiction scale			1
definitions vary , but an internet addiction usually includes symptoms such as spending a lot of time on the @entity4 ( especially more time than intended ) , an inability to cut back on usage , a preoccupation with online activities , and symptoms of withdrawal such as anxiety , boredom , or irritability after a few days of not going online			1
the researchers from @entity59 , in @entity40 , followed the youngsters for two years and found that adhd and hostility were linked to internet addiction in children in general			1
in girls -- but not boys -- depression and social phobia also predicted problems			1
@entity0 : therapy that can help depression boys were at a higher risk of internet addiction than girls , and those who used the internet for more than 20 hours a week , every day , or for online gaming , were at higher risk as well			1
@entity80 , a senior fellow at the @entity81 for the @entity82 at the @entity83 's @entity84 , says the findings were no surprise			0
" the study 's indication that children who are hyperactive or diagnosed @entity61 are finding an outlet on the @entity95 makes such perfect sense , " he says , because those children crave the constant stimulation of fast - paced video games and interactive social networks			2
@entity0 : what your teen needs to know about sex kids with depression , anger issues , or social problems also turn to the internet as therapy , adds @entity80 , who was not involved in the study			1
" they can take on an avatar or a different identity , and can contact other kids with the same problems and social inadequacies ; they do n't have to function in conventional social ways			0
" and while @entity80 is not surprised by the research -- he regularly studies the impact of the @entity4 and cell phone usage on family relationships -- he says it 's important that it is given the attention it deserves			0
" i do n't get the feeling when i talk to therapists that they really understand the concept of addiction to the @entity4 , " he says			2
" they think more in terms of pornography sites or gambling sites specifically , but internet addiction itself is not fully understood yet by the therapeutic community			1
" what parents , doctors , and teachers can do internet addiction may be not as widespread in the @entity138 -- or at least not as well recognized -- as in @entity140 countries			1
in 2008 , for example , a @entity142 survey showed that more than four million teenagers spend more than six hours a day online			0
@entity0 : how to care for someone who is suicidal but if at - risk children -- such as those identified in the @entity40 study -- are given sufficient time and exposure without careful monitoring , internet addiction could easily become one of the most chronic childhood diseases in @entity138 , says dr. @entity155 of the @entity81 , @entity156 , and @entity157 , in @entity158			1
our culture practically mandates time online , he says , with @entity162 connections in coffee shops and @entity164 and iphones that allow internet access almost anywhere			0
" it would be as if we mandated that everyone drink two beers every day or everyone gamble for an hour every day , " says @entity155			0
internet addiction among younger generations may often go unnoticed , however , because parents and pediatricians themselves are using the @entity95 more than they 'd like			1
@entity0 : health hazards hidden in college dorms since adolescents can not easily avoid computers , treatment for addiction can not simply involve abstaining from the @entity4 , says @entity155			1
parents , educators , and medical professionals need to identify high - risk children early on and monitor their internet usage to prevent problem behavior from forming			2
time on the @entity4 needs to be monitored as well , especially for children who may be at high risk for addiction because of depression , adhd , or social problems , says @entity155			2
" you ca n't tell a kid never to use the @entity4 the way you 'd tell an alcoholic never to have a drink again , " he adds			0
" but parents need to be thinking about what types of @entity4 or online gaming are particularly addictive			0
ones that allow for continuous , real - time feedback are particularly risky			0
" @entity80 says that families should strive to make the @entity4 a healthy part of their home life			0
" putting the computer in a very public place , like the hallway , can integrate the internet into normal life , rather than it becoming something you go off and do in secret , " he says			0
@entity0 : i 'm bipolar and struggle with addiction teachers and health - care professionals should also take the potential for internet addiction seriously , according to @entity155 , who cowrote an editorial published with the study			1
" our intention in raising this concern is not to be alarmist but rather to alert pediatricians to what might become a major public health problem for the @entity138 in the 21st century , " he writes			2
