-- after surviving a near - fatal car accident , @entity1 found herself battling a devastating bacterial infection in her colon that also threatened her life			1
the persistent infection was beaten through a little - known technique involving the transplant of fecal matter from @entity11 's mother , which put healthy bacteria back into her colon			1
following the july procedure , " i 've been so happy , " said @entity11 , 20 , of @entity14 , @entity15			2
" her struggle began more than a year earlier when she was released from a hospital in @entity20 , @entity21			0
a june 2011 car accident fractured her lower spine , lacerated her liver and colon , and broke all 10 toes			1
emergency crews used the @entity28 to cut @entity11 from her dad 's car , and then she was flown to the hospital , where she spent the next month			1
upon her release , @entity11 flew home to @entity15			2
it had n't been the summer vacation she imagined , but she thought she was getting better			0
but " right when i got off the plane , i went to the hospital			0
i was having extremely bad stomach pain			0
a month later , we found out it was @entity43 , " @entity11 said , using the abbreviation for the bacteria @entity43			2
how it began in the hospital after her accident , doctors followed standard care and put @entity11 on antibiotics to prevent an infection			1
in spite of the antibiotics -- or possibly because of them -- @entity43 infected her colon , causing severe stomach pain , diarrhea and vomiting			0
@entity11 , who stands 5 feet 7 inches tall , lost 40 pounds during her struggle			2
her weight plummeted to 85 pounds			0
it 's believed that antibiotics , which kill harmful infection - causing bacteria , also weaken the beneficial , healthy bacteria percolating in the colon			2
with the colon 's defenses down , @entity43 grows rampant , releasing a toxin and inflaming the colon			0
@entity73 diff infections kill about 14,000 people in the @entity75 every year , according to the @entity76 , and the number and severity of total cases have increased dramatically over the past decade			0
experts : alcohol enemas ' extremely dangerous ' even though antibiotics put someone at risk of developing a c. diff infection , standard treatment still calls for prescribing more and different antibiotics to kill the @entity43 and allow healthy bacteria to recolonize			1
but for many people such as @entity11 -- who went through nine rounds of antibiotic treatments -- the healthy bacteria never get the upper hand , and the @entity73 diff just keeps coming back			1
' brand - new ' treatment increasingly , doctors are taking a different approach			0
instead of continued assaults on bacteria , " fecal matter transplants " recolonize the colon with new bacteria from a healthy donor			1
" this is brand - new for most gastroenterologists , " said dr. @entity102 , @entity11 's treating physician			1
" we are very excited about this			0
" @entity102 had never deposited fecal matter by colonoscopy into a patient until @entity11 wanted to try it			1
@entity11 's mother " donated " one of her stools for the procedure			1
next , the hospital lab carefully diluted it , and @entity102 pumped the foreign fecal matter right into @entity11 's colon			1
the result ended @entity11 's struggle with @entity43			2
a study published in march reported a 91 % cure rate after just one fecal matter transplant , and a 98 % cure rate when combined with an additional round of antibiotics			1
remarkably , that study only included the sickest of patients			0
all 77 of the study participants already had a recurring @entity73 diff infection , having tried and failed five rounds of antibiotic - only treatments over 11 months , on average			2
the study used the colonoscopy method , which many believe is the most effective , because relatively large amounts of fecal matter can be placed deep inside the colon			1
other methods use either an enema or a nasogastric tube , which sends fecal matter through the nasal passage , down the throat and into the stomach			1
why polio has n't gone away yet @entity102 tried the nasogastric tube on @entity11 , using fecal material from her father , but the @entity73 diff infection returned			1
he then asked for and received permission to perform the hospital 's first colonoscopic fecal transplant			2
looking ahead gastroenterologists pioneering the practice unanimously seem to agree that eventually a cleaner , commercially developed suppository will replace the crude feces and water mixtures currently in use			0
" it 'll become a little more acceptable to hospitals and patients and more widely performed , " said dr. @entity160 , a professor of medicine and surgery at @entity164 's @entity163 who was the lead author on the march study			0
" but for people that have recurring @entity43 , it does n't really much matter , because these patients are so ill and so much want to get better			0
the fact that it 's stool , it does n't matter to them			0

after surviving a car accident , @entity1 battled a bacterial infection
nine rounds of antibiotics failed to provide a cure
@entity11 *underwent* a fecal matter transplant with material from her mother
her doctor says gastroenterologists are " very excited " about the treatment
