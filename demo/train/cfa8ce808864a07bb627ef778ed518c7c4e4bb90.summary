-- will @entity2 's @entity0 tirade earlier this week against television host @entity3 and @entity4 -- the founder and president of @entity4 , a national pro-family organization that emphasizes history 's " moral , religious and constitutional heritage " -- for allegedly creating " pseudo history " reveals more about mr. @entity2 than it does about what mr. @entity3 and mr. @entity4 are presenting			1
mr. @entity2 seems , above all , to be annoyed that many people are no longer staying on the liberal plantation of secularized @entity16 history			1
he offers little in the way of examples of error , just differences of opinion , such as his own assertion about " the much - debunked idea that @entity16 's creation was rooted in @entity25			1
" much debunked ? that would have been news to many of the @entity29 , whose biblical understanding of man as created in the image of @entity33 informed their insistence in the @entity35 that people have " unalienable rights " to " @entity38			0
" this was tempered by the biblically informed idea that man is prone to sin			0
in the @entity45 , no. 51 , for example , @entity43 wrote , " but what is government itself , but the greatest of all reflections on human nature ? if men were angels , no government would be necessary			0
" therefore , any government formed by men needs checks and balances to avoid tyranny			0
on a more elementary level , the signers of the @entity60 and the @entity61 were mostly @entity25			2
you can look it up			0
@entity2 complains that , " in april , @entity4 told @entity3 's 3 million tv viewers that ' we use the @entity68 as basis of civil law and the @entity71 [ and it ] has been for 2,000 years			1
' " @entity3 rewrites civil rights history perhaps this is why the @entity68 numerals are represented at the bottom of a door to the @entity16 @entity79 courtroom and why @entity80 , revered as the lawgiver to @entity82 in the @entity83 , and @entity25 in the @entity84 , appears holding two tablets elsewhere in the @entity79 building			1
he appears between the @entity88 philosopher @entity87 and @entity89 , the @entity91 statesman -- at the center of a frieze of historic lawgivers on the building 's @entity95			0
@entity80 is also among an array of lawgiver figures depicted over the @entity79 's chamber			2
tellingly , mr. @entity2 does not dispute the accuracy of the quotes that mr. @entity4 cites that spell out a @entity25 understanding of law and man among some of the @entity29			1
in a letter to @entity109 , written 37 years after the @entity35 , @entity107 wrote : " the general principles , on which the @entity29 achieved independence , were the only principles in which that beautiful assembly of young gentlemen could unite			2
... and what were these general principles ? i answer , the general principles of @entity25 , in which all these sects were @entity121 : ... now i will avow , that i then believe , and now believe , that those general principles of @entity25 , are as eternal and immutable , as the @entity122 ; and that those @entity123 , are as unalterable as human nature and our terrestrial , mundane system			2
" @entity138 , the first chief justice of the @entity79 , wrote in a letter to a friend , " @entity128 has given to our people the choice of their rulers , and it is the duty , as well as the privilege and interest of our @entity25 nation to select and prefer @entity25 for their rulers			1
" mr. @entity2 further complains that @entity4 " gives less than short shrift to the real achievement of the @entity143 in separating church and state			1
" i would argue that their real achievement was elsewhere			0
their real achievement was far larger : creation of a unique , limited government with protections for the freedoms of religion , speech , press and assembly and protection of property rights , without which no freedom exists			0
the result was the most prosperous and freest nation in history			0
and property rights are endorsed throughout the @entity164			0
the " wall of separation between church & state , " by the way , is not in the @entity61			0
it 's from a letter from president @entity109 to the @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , who were concerned that the national government would favor one @entity25 denomination over others			2
but mr. @entity109 's phrase has become a sacred totem used by activist judges to drive @entity25 symbols from the public square			2
the real reason that mr. @entity2 is so exercised is that the truth about @entity16 's @entity25 founding is getting out , despite media hostility , politically correct schoolbooks and rising intolerance toward any public expression of faith -- unless it advances leftist goals			1
@entity16 is a unique beacon of freedom precisely because of its founders ' @entity25 perspective , which has protected the right of conscience and thus freedom of religion for @entity82 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 and nonbelievers			1
try to identify another nation on @entity204 that similarly advanced individual rights without being influenced by @entity25			1
@entity3 and @entity4 are striking what @entity206 described in a different context as the " mystic chords of memory			1
" it makes perfect sense that many @entity16 are tuning in			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			0

@entity215 disputes ideas in opinion piece by @entity2 about @entity3 , @entity4
@entity2 *rejected* idea of @entity16 ' @entity25 roots , but there 's evidence for it , @entity215 says
moses shown on some @entity79 friezes ; some founders wrote of @entity25 principles
@entity215 : @entity16 unique in advancing individual rights because of its @entity25 ethic
