-- @entity1 , the man alleged to have masterminded one of the world 's largest sports doping operations , was found guilty of endangering public health by a court in @entity7 tuesday			1
@entity1 was handed a $ 5,800 fine by judge @entity9 and banned from practicing sports medicine for four years on top of a one - year suspended jail term			1
@entity13 , a former official with the @entity15 team , was given a four - month prison sentence , while @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity1 ' sister , @entity19 , were all found not guilty			1
but as judge @entity9 announced that @entity1 , the man at the epicenter of the @entity25 doping scandal was guilty of supplying cyclists with illegal blood transfusions , she simultaneously extinguished the hopes of those seeking to discover the extent of his work			1
while doping was not illegal in @entity34 at the time of his arrest , @entity1 was charged with violating public health laws after police discovered around 200 frozen blood and plasma specimens in his offices in 2006			1
@entity1 emerged largely unscathed at the conclusion of the 10 - week trial , but it is the judge 's proclamation that all evidence , documents and blood bags , be destroyed instead of being handed over to the @entity49 , which has stunned opponents of drug abuse			1
the news will come as a blow to protesters and the @entity34 government , which is currently in the process of trying to push through new anti-doping legislation in a bid to bring the country level with international standards			2
@entity61 , the director general of the @entity62 , had previously stated that her organization would push for the blood bags and specimens to be handed over at the conclusion of the trial			1
an appeal is expected to be launched on monday following the decision by the court , while @entity1 will begin life with a four - year ban from practicing as a doctor as well as starting to pay off a $ 5,880 fine			1
@entity25 focused on doping within cycling and uncovered a whole host of cyclists which had been complicit in working with @entity1			2
although the case was limited to @entity1 ' work within the realms of cycling , he confirmed during his trial that he also boasted clients in other sports such as tennis , athletics , football and boxing			2
during the trial , the court heard evidence from cyclists @entity93 , @entity95 rider @entity94 and @entity97 's @entity96 , all of who gave details of their dealings with @entity1			1
it was revealed that blood transfusions were often carried out by people without medical expertise in hotel rooms			2
according to evidence submitted to the court , banned substances such as @entity110 , @entity111 , testosterone , insulin and fertility drug @entity113 were sometimes combined with the transfusions			2
in her summation of the case , the @entity45 said : " the extractions and transfusions were not practiced in accordance with the sanitary norms but in a clandestine manner			0
" dr. @entity124 , the @entity125 's own medical expert , gave a frightening insight into just how dangerous blood transfusions could have been during his testimony in @entity34 , according to @entity130 website which is covered the trial			1
" extracting half a liter or a liter of blood presents a greater risk than extracting the usual amounts			0
that 's up to 20 % of the body 's total , whereas you would only extract 1 % for a blood analysis , " he said			0
" a hotel does not fulfill the conditions required for a transfusion , " he added , referring to the alleged unsanitary conditions in which the blood doping took place			0
" a cool bag for picnics is n't the best thing for transporting blood			0
" @entity124 also claimed that those partaking in such practices may have exposed themselves to contracting diseases such as @entity157 and hepatitis			0
cycling 's image has been shattered by doping with @entity161 the biggest name to have admitted to taking drugs			0
@entity161 , who admitted his guilt last january following years of denials , revealed he used testosterone and human growth hormone , as well as @entity110			0
@entity110 , a hormone naturally produced by human kidneys to stimulate red blood cells , increases the amount of oxygen which can be transported to muscles to aid recovery and endurance			0
the @entity95 cyclist was stripped of his seven @entity177 titles following his announcement after refusing to cooperate with the @entity179			0
he has since been banned for life after the organization accused him of running the " most sophisticated , professionalized and successful doping program " the sport had ever seen .			0
