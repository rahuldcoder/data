for years now , companies have been combing through @entity2 postings , trying to glean any information that may help them improve their products and services			1
but with more than 250 million tweets sent every day , it would take an enormous staff to analyze the data			2
that task gave rise to hundreds of social media - monitoring companies , but they were still limited to the tweets that could be accessed by individual users			0
@entity2 , however , has decided to make it easier for these companies to mine billions of messages for valuable marketing data			2
the company will open its archives and sell its old tweets			1
one of @entity2 's new customers , @entity26 , has formed an alliance with the social network to get access to tweets going back to january 2010			1
" @entity2 has really become an incredibly valuable information source , " said @entity31 , @entity26 's ceo			2
" there are a flood of companies wanting to get more use from it			0
" starting next month , @entity26 will launch a cloud - based service that will allow other companies to analyze these two - plus years of tweets to learn more about their customers			2
according to its website , @entity26 promises customers will be able to " unlock trends from public tweets " and " access the full @entity2 firehose			1
" users will pay @entity26 for only the data it retrieves			0
@entity26 will then share part of the revenue with @entity2			0
the company emphasizes it wo n't have access to deleted tweets or users ' direct messages			0
@entity2 also has partnered with @entity55 , a @entity56 - based online data - mining company , to license its historical tweets			1
because @entity2 is a public forum , privacy watchdogs may face difficulties raising objections			1
" we welcome the privacy debate , " said @entity31 , who is based in @entity62			0
@entity2 so far is not commenting publicly about its new partnership .			0

@entity2 will open its archives and sell old tweets to marketers who want to analyze the data
one customer will get access to tweets going back to january 2010
since @entity2 is a public forum , privacy watchdogs may face difficulties raising objections
