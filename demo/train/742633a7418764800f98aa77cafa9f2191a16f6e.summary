@entity0 , @entity1 -- did president @entity3 break his promise to @entity6 voters that he 'd deliver a comprehensive immigration reform plan in his first year ? and if so , will it wind up costing @entity10 candidates in the november mid-term elections and , for that matter , the president himself when he comes up for re-election in 2012 ? the answers are : yes and probably			1
yes , of course , @entity3 broke his promise to @entity20			1
and it is probably true that , for doing so , @entity3 and fellow @entity10 will continue to lose @entity6 support			1
and i 'm not the only one saying it			0
this week , during an appearance on " @entity28 , " @entity26 anchor @entity25 blamed @entity3 and congressional @entity29 for failing to take action to fix the nation 's broken immigration system			1
the issue is at the center of @entity25 ' new book , " a @entity36 : an @entity37			0
" guest host @entity38 showed a video clip of @entity25 asking candidate @entity3 in 2008 if he would commit to reforming the immigration system			1
@entity3 responded , " i can not guarantee that it 's going to be in the first 100 days			1
but what i can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that i strongly support and that i 'm promoting and that i want to move that forward as quickly as possible			1
" that first year came and went , and now we 're 18 months into the @entity3 administration			1
there 's no immigration bill in sight			1
in fact , sen. @entity49 , d - @entity50 , has said that he wo n't propose a bill he 's been working on until after the november elections , possibly as late as march 2011			2
@entity38 asked @entity25 what he made of this			0
" ( @entity3 ) broke his promise , " he said			1
" it 's that simple , and obviously , he does n't have the 60 votes			2
" then , @entity25 backed off a bit and , parroting a popular line coming out of the @entity61 , started blaming the @entity29			0
" where are the @entity29 ? " he asked			0
" where are the 11 republicans that voted for immigration reform two years ago ? where is @entity67 ? " indeed			2
@entity67 is running for re-election back in @entity69 , doing his best impersonation of @entity71 at @entity72			0
the @entity73 has become the @entity74			0
sure , the @entity29 deserve their share of the blame , especially since they 've tried to oversimplify and demagogue the issue to scare up support			1
but let 's not forget which political party controls both ends of @entity82			0
the many @entity20 i 've been hearing from in the past six months have n't forgotten			2
although he hails from @entity84 , @entity85 , a city and state with sizable @entity6 populations , @entity3 has spent most of his life in a black and white world			2
he knew very little about @entity20 before he launched his presidential campaign , and he was forced to try to find a way to speak to them			0
he seized on the strategy of being a kinder and gentler alternative to @entity29 on the immigration debate			0
he condemned @entity98 agents who " terrorize " immigrants by snatching parents away from their babies in workplace raids and promising to deliver comprehensive immigration reform in his first year in office			1
now , after a year and a half in office , @entity98 is still conducting immigration raids , and comprehensive immigration reform is n't on the table			1
more and more of the @entity20 i hear from feel as if they 've been snookered			0
they see the passion that @entity3 put into an issue he really cared about -- health care -- and they resent the fact that when it comes to immigration reform , the president seems to think that words speak louder than actions			1
what they resent even more is that they feel teased every time @entity3 makes yet another major speech promising to deliver something he has no intention of delivering -- comprehensive immigration reform			1
with the delaying and the teasing , it 's not surprising that @entity3 's stock with @entity6 voters is falling			1
@entity3 won two - thirds of the @entity6 vote in 2008			2
in january , at the end of his first year , his job approval rating with @entity20 stood at 69 percent			0
in february , it fell to 64 percent			0
and , in may , according to a recent @entity139 poll , it slipped to 57 percent			0
some political observers believe that the recently filed lawsuit by the @entity143 against the @entity69 immigration law is part of the administration 's strategy of rebuilding support with @entity20 , about 70 percent of whom oppose the measure			1
for one thing , that strategy would n't work			0
@entity20 are n't about to give @entity3 , a former lecturer on constitutional law , much credit for recognizing the obvious : that the @entity69 law is blatantly unconstitutional because it usurps federal authority over immigration law in violation of @entity159 1 , section 8			1
the suit could have gone further and argued , as other lawsuits against the measure have , that the process of implementing the law runs the risk of violating the @entity166 of the 14th amendment by singling out @entity20 as the most likely to resemble illegal immigrants			0
such a law is so odious that the idea that the federal government would challenge it is a given			0
after all , the @entity3 administration is n't suing @entity69 to defend @entity20 but to defend the @entity174			1
so that wo n't assuage the concerns of @entity20 that the @entity61 does n't really care about them or issues that matter to them			0
the way to do that is to pass comprehensive immigration reform			0
until that happens , words without actions are meaningless			0
in fact , every time this administration tries to reassure @entity6 voters that it is in their corner , the effect is the opposite			2
it reminds @entity20 that , as long as @entity3 is in the @entity61 , they 're on their own			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194			2

@entity3 promised to have an immigration bill he could support in his first year in office
@entity194 says the president did n't fulfill the promise
he says republicans share the blame , but @entity10 control @entity205
