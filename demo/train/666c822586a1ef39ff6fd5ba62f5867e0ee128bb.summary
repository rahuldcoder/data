-- the wind blowing through the streets of @entity3 could n't power the city , but wind machines placed thousands of feet above the city theoretically could			1
a prototype of a high - altitude wind turbine made by @entity9			1
the first rigorous , worldwide study of high - altitude wind power estimates that there is enough wind energy at altitudes of about 1,600 to 40,000 feet to meet global electricity demand a hundred times over			1
the very best ground - based wind sites have a wind - power density of less than 1 kilowatt per square meter of area swept			1
up near the jet stream above @entity23 , the wind power density can reach 16 kilowatts per square meter			1
the air up there is a vast potential reservoir of energy , if its intermittency can be overcome			2
even better , the best high - altitude wind - power resources match up with highly populated areas including @entity33 's @entity32 and @entity35 's coastline			1
" the resource is really , really phenomenal , " said @entity36 of @entity37 , who co-authored a paper on the work published in the open - access journal @entity41			2
" there is a lot of energy up there , but it 's not as steady as we thought			2
it 's not going to be the silver bullet that will solve all of our energy problems , but it will have a role			0
" for centuries , we 've been using high - density fossil fuels , but peaking oil supplies and climate concerns have given new life to green technologies			2
unfortunately , renewable energy is generally diffuse , meaning you need to cover a lot of area to get the energy you want			0
so engineers look for renewable resources that are as dense as possible			0
on that score , high - altitude wind looks very promising			1
@entity69 's power -- energy which can be used to do work like spinning magnets to generate electricity -- varies with the cube of its speed			1
so , a small increase in wind speed can lead to a big increase in the amount of mechanical energy you can harvest			2
high - altitude wind blows fast , is spread nicely across the globe , and is easier to predict than terrestrial wind			1
these properties have led inventors and scientists to cast their hopes upward , where strong winds have long been known to blow , as @entity91 's dreamy quote shows			0
during the energy shocks of the 1970s , when new energy ideas of all kinds were bursting forth , engineers and schemers patented several designs for harnessing wind thousands of feet in the air			1
the two main design frameworks they came up with are still with us today			0
the first is essentially a power plant in the sky , generating electricity aloft and sending it down to @entity107 via a conductive tether			2
the second is more like a kite , transmitting mechanical energy to the ground , where generators turn it into electricity			1
theoretically , both approaches could work , but nothing approaching a rigorous evaluation of the technologies has been conducted			0
the @entity120 had a very small high - altitude wind program , which produced some of the first good data about the qualities of the wind up there , but it got axed as energy prices dropped in the 1980s and @entity129 - era @entity120 officials directed funds elsewhere			1
the program has n't been restarted , despite growing attention to renewables , but that 's not because it 's considered a bad idea			0
rather , it is seen as just a little too far out on the horizon			0
" we 're very much aimed these days at things that we can fairly quickly commercialize , like in the next 10 years or so , " said @entity139 spokesperson @entity138			0
startups like @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity9 , and @entity145 ( @entity147 's secretive fundee ) have come into the space over the last several years , and they seem to be working on much shorter timelines			0
" we are not that far from working prototypes , " @entity150 said , though she noted that the companies are all incredibly secretive about the data from their testing			0
@entity156 cfo @entity156 said he expects " first revenue " next year when they sell " two to four " working prototypes of their blimpy machine , which will operate at much lower altitudes			0
" we do think that we 're going to be first [ to market ] , unless something happens , " @entity163 said			0
in the long term , trying to power entire cities with machines like this would be difficult , largely because even in the best locations , the wind will fail at least 5 percent of the time			2
" this means that you either need backup power , massive amounts of energy storage , or a continental - or even global - scale electricity grid to assure power availability , " said co-author @entity173 , an ecologist at @entity174			1
" so , while high - altitude wind may ultimately prove to be a major energy source , it requires substantial infrastructure			1

study : wind machines placed thousands of feet above @entity23 could power the city
enough wind energy exists at high altitudes to meet global demand 100 times over
a kite - like *device* could transmit energy to generators that turn it into electricity
startups are developing turbines , although they are still in the prototype stage
