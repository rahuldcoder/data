-- i 'm @entity2 , and i 'm what many @entity3 would refer to as " one of those idiots on reality tv			1
" recently , i was featured on a new documentary series that focuses on the lives of @entity10 : " i 'm @entity10 and ...			1
" i thought the show would be a rare platform to show an @entity10 story that had not been told : my life as a performance artist and hip - hop mogul			1
as an artist , the issues i explore have been deemed too " scary , " " niche " and " unprofitable " for mainstream media			1
among these issues : the high rates of depression and suicide in the @entity10 community , white privilege , racial stereotypes , poverty tourism , gender and sexism			1
what drew me to becoming a performance artist was the chance to create my message on my terms			1
i do n't wait for someone to write me a role			0
i certainly do n't wait for someone to cast me in a role			0
and i 'm not holding my breath waiting for a bad - ass wisecracking @entity41 @entity3 lady character like me to show up on " @entity42			0
" leading @entity10 women exist on television , but i can count them on one hand			1
when you see other @entity10 women my age on scripted television , they are usually side characters handing over scalpels , playing someone 's badly accented mother or are scantily clad			1
if i 'm taking on issues barely addressed among @entity10 , why would i expect mainstream media to pick up on them , too ? some back story : i grew up in @entity59			1
i 'm @entity41 @entity3 , got great grades all through high school and went to @entity62			0
but i bucked stable career paths in medicine , law and engineering to pursue the most unstable of careers : performance art. my performances do n't fit the standard fare of what most people might expect of an @entity10 woman			1
i do n't tell reductive jokes about my @entity3 - born mother 's nonexistent @entity41 accent			0
i do n't do martial arts ( though i so own several zumba dvds )			0
i do n't tell stories peppered with exotic details of @entity41 culture that deliver @entity83 wisdom			0
my work has already killed any possibility of a future in politics : stand - up comedy dressed as a giant vagina , crashing the @entity90 dressed as a fake miss @entity91 and marrying myself ( twice ! ) in public ceremonies			0
last year , i recorded a hit rap album in northern @entity95 with local rappers			0
i 've also toured five original one - woman theater shows around the world			0
i 'd like to think my approach is bawdy , funny and fearless			0
i 've been told i 'm the living antithesis of a stereotypical submissive and quiet @entity10 woman			2
so i decided to tackle that taboo on my episode of " i 'm @entity10 and ... " by collecting reparations from " yellow fever guys " -- slang for white men who only date @entity10 women			2
my dates , all real , described how they prefer dating @entity10 women because we are " hairless , " " gentle " and " love to cook and clean " : basically every objectifying stereotype of a submissive @entity10 woman			2
during our dates , i coerce these men to clean my house , pay my exorbitant dinner tabs , and watch me perform a very painfully long performance art piece complete with multiple screaming birthing scenes			2
it 's not about gold digging , it 's about finding small moments of justice for a lifetime of being objectified and fetishized as an @entity10 woman			2
no , i do n't expect to win an award for showing these white men that an @entity10 woman can be as crude and wisecracking as people of any other race			1
and i do n't expect people to jump up and declare that i 've ended racial oppression with a reality television appearance			1
but my 15 minutes of fame ( 23 to be exact ) felt like a rare moment to provide some cathartic humor for those wanting to see an @entity10 woman who would go to the outrageous depths that characters on scripted television show would not			1
i look forward to a day when i see a sitcom telling the stories of every different @entity10 ethnicity , @entity146 , women , mixed race @entity10 and the @entity10 like me whose families have been here for generations			2
from the trailer , it seems like @entity155 's new sitcom " @entity156 " will be a funny subversive take on the @entity41 @entity3 family experience			0
it 's the first scripted sitcom in 20 years to feature an @entity10 family on network television			1
the last , @entity164 's " @entity163 , " was panned by critics			0
the show 's failure did n't stop @entity164 from making comedy			0
if anything , it strengthened her , and she told the story of that show 's failure in subsequent media and appearances			0
but i hope that viewers do n't expect one sitcom to tell every @entity10 's story , any more than a sitcom with a white family does not tell the story of every white person in this country			1
" @entity10 " includes a diverse range people of @entity10 descent , each with a unique history and culture			2
opinion : the surprising racial bias against @entity190 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0
