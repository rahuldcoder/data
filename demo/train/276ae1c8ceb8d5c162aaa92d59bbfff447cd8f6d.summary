-- when @entity3 explorers were planting their flags all over @entity5 , they referred to the territory as the " @entity7			1
" that was a misnomer			1
for while the @entity5 might have been " new " to the @entity3 , they were n't new on the world timeline			1
things were happening in the @entity12 a long , long time ago , as the sites on this list ( a very small sampling ) demonstrate			1
some you might know already ; others might come as a surprise			1
many of them are sites of active archaeological research that continues to unearth new examples of very interesting old stuff			1
15 ancient ruins you might not know @entity27 , @entity28 theorists have explained @entity27 as everything from a temple complex built by nomads to the work of an extraterrestrial society			1
its truth is only slightly less extraordinary , and it tantalizes with questions of why and how a city of temples , public buildings , homes , streets and irrigation systems was built at 13,000 feet above sea level in the @entity45 of the @entity46			1
between 500 and 900 a.d. , the @entity27 civilization numbered in the hundreds of thousands			2
by 1200 , they were gone			2
archaeologists continue to study the site , even constructing reed boats to demonstrate how stones weighing several tons might have been transported from one shore of nearby @entity55 to the other			2
you 'll need imagination to picture @entity27 as it was ; a visit during the winter or summer solstice celebrations can enhance its mystical qualities			2
@entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 about 75 million years ago , western @entity64 was part of an island continent called @entity67 , and this 30 - square - mile expanse of badlands was populated by creatures great and small			1
sounds like the start of a fantasy novel , but it 's a dream come true for anyone fascinated by dinosaurs			1
@entity77 adds 19 sites to @entity79 since the turn of the last century , when paleontologists began working here in earnest , the park has yielded thousands of prehistoric remains , including hundreds of complete dinosaur skeletons from the @entity87			2
at the park you can join in or observe current fieldwork			2
there are activities for families and kids , guided and self - guided tours , and sunset excursions for photographers			2
to see more specimens recovered from the park , visit the @entity98 in @entity99 , two hours away			2
@entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 with its five towering pyramids , probably built between 250 and 900 a.d. ( ongoing research regularly revises the dates ) and situated to correspond with the position of the sun , @entity100 is the site by which other @entity111 archaeological sites are measured , both in scope and significance			2
@entity100 also encompasses @entity115 -- once a separate city -- as well as nearly 55,000 acres of rainforest that add to its beauty and mystery			2
the @entity120 in northern @entity102 continually yields archaeological discoveries from the @entity122 , such as the stunning frieze found in @entity124 earlier this year			0
the murals at @entity126 are under consideration for @entity79 status			0
in neighboring @entity129 , is the @entity111 site of @entity131 -- founded by a splinter group from @entity100			0
@entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 @entity133 is a marvel of urban planning , especially when you consider that the @entity139 -- and later the @entity140 -- who built it did so by carving its terraced landscape out of the mountainside			1
and they began construction sometime around 500 b.c. it was built to be grand , from the ceremonial pyramids to the stadium surrounding the ball court , and because it 's so impressive @entity133 tends to be heavily visited today			0
the most famous artifacts are the series of @entity139 carved stone slabs known as @entity151 ( the dancers ) because it was originally assumed they depicted dancing men			1
current scholarship says they depict disemboweled prisoners of war , which would be strange , yet in keeping with the unusual artistic sensibilities of the @entity139			1
@entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity135 it 's hard to know what to think about the @entity139			1
they practiced ritual human bloodletting and raised dogs that they subsequently ate as part of their regular diet			0
on the other hand , they 're probably responsible for introducing chocolate to the world			0
they also left a wondrous legacy of carved stone sculptures , especially the enormous stone heads for which they 're known			0
many @entity139 sculptures discovered at @entity181 in @entity182 and at @entity183 in @entity161 -- @entity139 settlements dating back to 1200 @entity185 -- have been relocated to museums where they 're more accessible for public viewing			1
you 'll find more than 30 , including three 20 - ton heads , at @entity191 in @entity160			0
the 16 - acre park is known for its tropical foliage and for the dramatic sound and light show that illuminates the sculptures at night			0
@entity196 , @entity197 @entity199 is the most widely known archaeological site in @entity197 , the @entity198 are arguably the most mysterious , but @entity196 , located about three miles from @entity201 , deserves mention because while its past is documented , its future is uncertain			0
the capital of the @entity207 culture , @entity196 probably dates back to before 850 a.d. at its peak in the early 1400s it had a population of 30,000 before the @entity212 came and wiped it all out			1
what remains of the huge earthwork city is still astounding -- networks of beautifully carved and sculpted adobe walls delineate enclaves devoted to work , worship and family life			0
about five square miles of the @entity196 site is on the @entity79 , but even @entity77 ca n't stop the wind and weather from slowly eroding @entity196			0
@entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 @entity224 looks like a grouping of giant lumps in the earth -- hills where no hills should be , built by the @entity234 culture more than 1,000 years ago			1
the largest is 100 feet high and bigger than the @entity235 at its base			0
around it once stood wooden houses and plazas where people gathered for ceremonies that involved a potent concoction called @entity243 and competitions in a vigorous sport called chunkey			0
inside the mounds , archaeologists have found a wealth of objects including unexpected specimens like shark 's teeth carried from the @entity254 to western @entity226 in some way yet to be determined			0
in fact , much of what went on at @entity224 is still undetermined , including why this thriving community -- the oldest pre-columbian settlement north of @entity135 -- disappeared in the early 14th century			1
rock art of the @entity261 , @entity262 , @entity227 around @entity264 , @entity262 , where the @entity265 meets the @entity267 , acres of unremarkable terrain hold a remarkable surprise : cave paintings ( pictographs ) and carvings ( petroglyphs ) made by the prehistoric hunter - gatherers who lived here thousands of years ago			1
they 're not especially easy to reach , which has been their salvation , having left them largely unmolested throughout the centuries			0
recently archaeologists have been working to raise awareness of the sites in order to catalog , preserve and protect them			0
guided tours at @entity285 take you on a rigorous 1.5 - mile hike to the @entity288			0
other tours conducted by members of the nonprofit @entity292 visit sites located on private land			0
@entity294 and @entity295 in the @entity296 near @entity297 are accessible by boat .			0

things were happening in the ' @entity7 ' a long , long time ago
