a @entity2 , @entity1 , man has been indicted in connection with the death of @entity5 , a 28 - year - old father of three whose mysterious disappearance and death sparked protests , controversy and allegations of a law enforcement cover up			1
@entity12 , 28 , who graduated with @entity5 from @entity13 , has been charged with two counts of drug - related offenses that resulted in @entity5 's death			1
@entity12 , who pleaded not guilty during an initial appearance in federal court on friday , has a detention hearing next week			2
he faces up to 20 years to life on each count , which allege that he supplied the fatal dose to @entity5			2
@entity5 disappeared in rural @entity25 , @entity1 , on november 7 , 2013			2
after authorities called off the search a few days later , a search party organized by his family found @entity5 's body on november 25 , a few hundred feet from the original search command post			1
the condition , position and location of the body raised suspicion among family members and others in @entity1 about what happened to this physically fit @entity41 - @entity40 man in an area known for having racial tensions after the 1998 dragging death of @entity45 @entity5 , a physical therapist who made house calls , had been treating patients when his pickup truck broke down near the @entity52 liquor store			1
after calling his wife , @entity55 , for help , and with his parents on the way , a clerk at the store said @entity5 tucked his cell phone in his sock and inexplicably took off on foot			0
the family had maintained @entity5 never used drugs			2
however , friday 's indictment contradicts that			0
in it , authorities allege that @entity70 , on the day her husband disappeared , told a deputy she had n't observed anything unusual that day but called back and recanted her statement			0
she told the deputy that @entity5 had " been acting very strange lately " and that she " suspected " he was " on something			0
" the indictment included a series of text messages between @entity5 and @entity12 , which authorities said show @entity5 bought cocaine , methamphetamine and @entity83 from @entity84 on the day he died and regularly before that			2
those three drugs were found in @entity5 's body			1
at the time the toxicology report came out , @entity5 's mother , @entity88 , said she believed the drugs were pumped into her son			1
a toxicology report prepared by a pathologist hired by the family , and obtained by @entity95 , also found an anabolic steroid in @entity5 's system			1
that report concurred with an official autopsy in finding @entity5 died of an accidental drug overdose			1
however , in the report , the pathologist , dr. @entity101 stated , " trauma can not be definitively ruled out			0
" both reports showed long - term cocaine use by @entity5			2
in the indictment , authorities said @entity70 on november 11 taped a conversation with @entity12 in which he allegedly admitted to selling drugs to @entity5 on the day he disappeared			1
the indictment also discloses a text message sent by @entity5 to @entity84 that said : " @entity111 gino and a 20 and 3 handles , " which the indictment translated to mean @entity5 was asking for a gram of cocaine , $ 20 worth of meth , and 3 @entity83 pills			0
@entity5 was scheduled to see 10 patients on the day he disappeared			0
the second client told authorities @entity5 excused himself because he felt sick			0
the family has long stated that one of the failures of the investigation was authorities ' neglecting to search			0
the indictment said authorities tried to search @entity5 's truck but were not given consent			1
it said the family searched the truck , found a business computer that was turned over to law enforcement and a personal computer that was not			0
when @entity5 's body was found , parts were missing and it had puncture wounds , authorities said			1
they concluded that was the result of animal scavenging activity and injuries from barbed wire			0
@entity70 did not respond to a request for comment			0
@entity5 's sister @entity144 posted on @entity145 that she did not support the @entity40 attorney 's indictment , saying : " the true killers , slaughterers , lynchmen and henchmen are walking free ! mr. @entity12 is merely being used as a scapegoat in an extensive and meticulous ploy to mask the truth			1

@entity12 charged with drug - related offenses that resulted in @entity5 's death
@entity5 was missing three weeks before his body was found
a *coroner* 's report says his body was *filled* with drugs , and his death was ruled accidental
