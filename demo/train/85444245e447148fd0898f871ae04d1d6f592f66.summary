@entity0 , @entity1 -- now in modern @entity1 all the constructions have become modern , everywhere is concrete and concrete in @entity1 means cheap			1
but my way is thinking about how i can use the concrete and the traditional ways so that they can coexist			2
it is very difficult now in @entity1 because there have been so many changes , the construction system has changed , it is almost all like the @entity16 system now and the materials used have changed			1
so now , we talk about how to design a new @entity1 architecture , but it is very difficult because tradition has stopped , philosophy has stopped and the @entity1 value system has stopped -- everything is different			1
for example , if you look at @entity1 traditional buildings , you will find they are not just about the solid structure			1
they have many outside spaces inside the buildings as people want to live with fresh air , trees , flowers and water together			2
we use the courtyard house in many different places : in homes , shops , factories , office buildings , schools , jails , everything			2
going into @entity1 buildings you can directly feel the difference between outside and inside			1
when you sit outside , you are in a very closed world ; you wear a suit			2
when you go inside , everything is very delicate and there are very small things -- you can feel everything is warmer and more peaceful			2
the wooden structure is like your inner clothes so it is very clear -- outside and inside			2
in traditional @entity1 architecture they use wood and not very good wood -- simple , cheap wood			1
maybe the building will just stay up for 50 years and then it will collapse			1
it is very similar to process of nature			2
i like this very much			2
some buildings , they rebuild and recycle , again and again and again			0
and finally you will find maybe just 10 % of the elements come from 1,500 years ago and the other elements are new			1
it repeats , repeats , rebuilds , rebuilds , again and again and again			0
it is as though the building is alive			0
in @entity0 we have a traditional pagoda			1
when i go in this pagoda , suddenly i understand some things			0
for example , it is huge , but if you see it from a distant place , on some special day when the sun is at different angles , you will find that this pagoda just disappears -- it totally blends into the mountains so you ca n't see it			0
it is then that i suddenly understand how i can design big modern buildings using the traditional ways , how buildings can disappear in the landscape			0
more from @entity99 : @entity100 soprano : opera singers are athletes in @entity1 the most important thing is nature			1
it is not human beings , it is not architecture -- it is nature			0
so that is why i like @entity1 traditional architecture			1
it means a philosophy and a value system			0
it is about how people can live together with nature			0
@entity1 has a long history of 5,000 years , so for a long time people have understood the meaning of the truth of life			1
for example , you go into the cities , you earn a big money , you become a powerful government official -- but that is not the most important thing for @entity1 people			1
the most important thing for the @entity1 is ... being beautiful about life , living in some peaceful place with trees , water and your family together			1
if you are an artist you only have to keep your passion alive for maybe three days or one month			0
but for the architect , your assistant , your client , the craftsmen and the construction company -- everybody is connected to your project			1
you have to keep the passion alive for five years , right to the very end			2
you become like a leader and everyone should be able to feel your spirit and passion			0
more from @entity99 : top designer shares secret of staying in vogue when i design new buildings in a new place , i go there not just to see the site			0
i go to all the countryside around and see more than 10 or 20 villages			2
i take many photos , shoot movies and do some drawings			0
i read books about the area ... then gradually something emerges			0
if you really want to understand traditional @entity1 architecture you should really know the craftsman 's work because in @entity1 for a long time we did not have architecture theory or history , we did not have architects -- we only had craftsmen so the secret was just in the craftsman 's hands			1
throughout the 1990s , i did n't have any formal jobs			0
i just worked with craftsmen together for 10 years			1
i wanted to forget everything i had learned in the architecture school			0
the biggest problem for @entity1 now is not about the economy -- it is about the fact that people have lost confidence in their culture			1
winning the @entity191 has given people more confidence to like my work			1
architecture has become too abstract ... ( architects ) are floating in the air and are not rooted in the ground			0
i do something that is directly rooted in the ground			0
i think it is more important			0
i learned many things from the traditional way but every single one of my works is in the city so i think the next step i will go back ... and do something in the countryside .			0
