-- the battering that the @entity2 image is taking in @entity3 these days reflects that the sources of anger against @entity2 in the @entity6 run deep			1
we 're not the primary reason the @entity6 is so screwed up			2
the @entity9 themselves need to own up to that			1
just take a look at @entity13 and @entity3			2
but we are still a big part of the story			2
some extremist @entity16 hammer us because they do n't like @entity18 values ; others see the conspiratorial hand of @entity2 everywhere -- sucking the life out of @entity9 and @entity16 independence , pride and dignity			1
but once you get away from the fringes , what you find is equally disturbing : millions of @entity9 and @entity16 do n't like us not because of who we are but because of what we do			1
and since those are unlikely to change anytime soon , there 's a pretty good chance @entity2 will continue to lose the public image battle in the @entity6			1
and here 's why : minds and hearts : we 've always had it backwards			0
it 's not hearts then minds at all			0
if you want to capture the imagination of people living in the @entity6 and get them to warm to @entity2 , you do n't play to their emotions first			1
it 's as if a new pretty bow on a package with the same contents as ever is somehow going to help sell @entity2 policy			1
first , capture people 's minds , appeal to their cognitive self - interest and then their hearts will follow			0
that would require a significant readjustment of @entity2 policy : the @entity2 would have to be much tougher on @entity59 on settlements and practices such as land confiscation , closures and withholding tax revenues in the @entity65			1
the @entity2 would have to be much fairer when it came to @entity67 issues , including supporting reasonable resolutions at the @entity69 and taking positions in negotiations that really did try to find an equitable balance , instead of viewing reality through a @entity75 filter			1
the @entity2 would still have a special relationship with our close @entity59 ally , just not an exclusive one			1
the @entity2 would have to be much clearer about standing up to human rights abuses in the @entity9 world and much tougher on the @entity9 kings where @entity2 is reluctant to offend its conservative allies			1
people know where and what their interests are			0
and if we want to improve our credibility , we 'd need to find a fairer balance between theirs and ours on many issues			0
values vs. interests : it 's stunning testament to the @entity2 predicament in the @entity6 that within two years of @entity98 's overthrow -- handled relatively well by the @entity100 administration -- we are being attacked for backing both @entity101 and the generals and criticized by just about everyone , even the secular opposition			1
you can pick your favorite culprit			0
the @entity2 ambassador , secretary of state @entity109 's yachting outing , @entity100 's naivete about the @entity111 or his softness toward the military			1
but none of them is the reason			0
we lost our footing in @entity3 because the tension between our values and interests results in unpopular and inconsistent policies			2
we back the democratically elected @entity101 government , even though it behaves in an undemocratic manner ; and when the military intervenes and cracks down , shooting 50 people , we react mildly			1
to a great extent , these inconsistencies are a result of the chaos of @entity3 politics , but they also are related to our nation 's wariness of change			0
when stability in the region has been the guiding principle for half a century or more , it 's never easy to adjust , especially for the big power			0
just look at @entity142 's @entity141 and @entity13 's @entity143			0
but more than that , if @entity3 are confused , ca n't get their own house in order and do n't produce big leaders or credible democratic institutions on which the @entity2 can find a focal point for its policy , we 're going to continue to stumble and bumble around			1
we backed @entity101 because we believe in the almighty ballot box			0
and we backed the generals because we have other interests -- the @entity155 - @entity59 peace treaty , security for the @entity158 , counterterrorism , containing @entity159 -- that commend supporting the military , too			2
that we could n't reconcile the two in response to @entity3 realities should come as no great surprise			2
nor should the reality that we earn the disfavor of so many frustrated @entity3			0
great power hypocrisy : great powers are big and strong enough that they can afford to behave inconsistently and hypocritically			0
it 's as if it were part of their job description			0
but that inconsistency can confuse and disappoint			0
our policies toward the @entity178 are laced with contradictions			2
we support real political change in @entity3 , but we wo n't push it hard in @entity181 or in @entity182 where oil , stability and @entity2 bases reign supreme			1
we 'll intervene militarily in @entity186 because it 's easier -- but not in @entity13 , where the strength of @entity143 's allies , military and a chemical weapons capacity make it much riskier			2
and in the greatest paradox of all , our ties with the monarchies -- @entity195 , @entity181 and @entity196 -- are much closer than with the emerging and struggling democracies at a time when the @entity6 yearns for democracy and freedom			0
it is indeed remarkable that the @entity9 kings have become our new anchors in a turbulent sea of political change			1
@entity109 has discovered @entity195 as a key ally in this peace process policy			0
earlier this year , the @entity2 completed a huge arms sale to @entity181 and the @entity210 worth billions			1
expectations for @entity2 run high in the world ; and too often we help raise them , particularly in the @entity6			1
@entity100 came into office promising a new look in this region : more engagement , a greater sensitivity toward @entity219 and a pro-active policy on the @entity59 - @entity67 issue			0
and it 's a cruel irony that this putative transformer ended up tougher than his predecessor on drones and @entity159 and as cautious on @entity59 - @entity67 peace			0
but governing is about choosing			0
and @entity100 chose willfully and wisely not to chase windmills abroad but to concentrate on trying to fix @entity2 's broken house			1
coming off the two longest wars in @entity2 history , where the standard for victory was not whether we would win , but when we could leave , who could blame him			2
for @entity100 the middle class was always going to be more important than the @entity6			0
and for better or worse , @entity2 's standing in that region shows it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity241 .			2

@entity241 : @entity9 create their own woes , but chaotic @entity2 policies play a role
@entity241 : arabs and @entity16 are n't angry because of what we are but because of what we do
we back an undemocratic @entity254 government and ignore military *excesses* , he says
@entity241 : we ignore abuses in some nations and blast them in others
