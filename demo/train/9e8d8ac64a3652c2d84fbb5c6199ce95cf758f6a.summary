@entity0 -- the @entity2 could have done a better job in dealing with a snowstorm that caused accidents and shut down a section of interstate highway near @entity8 , @entity0 , an agency spokesman said friday			1
the agency is reviewing emergency procedures after hundreds of snowbound motorists were left stranded along a seven - mile stretch of @entity15 , agency spokesman @entity10 said			1
" we tried to contact stranded motorists , " he said			1
" we tried to bring them water and nutrition			0
" authorities used plows and all - terrain vehicles to clear the road and provide food , water and gas to those stuck , and even busing stranded motorists to a senior center - turned - shelter in suburban @entity29			1
@entity10 said the agency is searching for ways it could have prevented additional motorists from joining the gridlocked section of the highway , which was closed for more than 24 hours			1
" we 're looking for a better way to do that , by putting up barriers and reaching out to them , " @entity10 said			0
the highway reopened at 6 a.m. friday			1
more lake - effect snow fell on parts of @entity41 friday , forecasters said , as residents continued digging out from the storm that left some 6 - foot - high snow drifts in its wake			1
the @entity47 said more than 2 feet of snow fell over the past two days in a band south and east of @entity8 , with 3 feet or more in a narrow area at the center of that band			1
" when the snow first hit , i could barely get a mile from my house , " said @entity8 resident @entity53			2
" it 's better now because the snow plows are in action			2
" @entity60 resident @entity59 said she can drive on roads once rendered impassable			0
" yesterday , we could n't even open our door , " she said			0
while packing a punch , the storm was hardly a record - setter : more than 76 inches of snow fell in @entity8 in late december 2001 , including 35.4 inches in a single 24 - hour period , according to the @entity69			1
" normally we get several of these a year , but more down south in what we call ski country , " said @entity71 meteorologist @entity70 in @entity8 , @entity0			0
" the impact of this storm was that is was over the metro areas , which caused some of the problems			0
" @entity80 motorist and @entity82 resident @entity79 said she had been traveling to @entity8 in an effort buy groceries and @entity85 presents when she was stopped by gridlocked highways and mounting snow drifts , trapping her in her car for more than 24 hours			2
" they dug me out just around 9:30 last night , " @entity90 said			0
" we had gone over to @entity8 wednesday night to go shopping			0
... " that 's how bad the lake effect is			1
" branch said " the whole situation could have been dealt with a lot better , " adding that there was little communication between trapped motorists and state emergency workers			2
" every time we asked a question ( of @entity107 officers ) there was no concrete answer , " she said			0
" they were dancing around all the questions we asked them			0
" the @entity47 said several inches of snow would accumulate around @entity114 on friday , with lake - effect snow showers tapering off friday evening			1
it was " just too much in too short of a time , " @entity116 , who offered his plow to help thursday , told @entity1 affiliate @entity120			2
shifting winds from an east - moving front combined with record - breaking warm water temperatures in @entity82 to create the intense early december storm , meteorologists said			2
@entity126 , 22 , whose office backs up to the once - clogged highway , said people -- including a few truck drivers wearing only t - shirts as they waded through 2 1/2f feet of snow -- had been scaling fences all day to get food and find warmth			1
he said the interstate was " completely dead " most of thursday			0
ironically , his hometown of @entity138 , 11 miles north of @entity8 , had minimal snow			0
" it was kind of weird -- it was almost like a blanket " covering some spots and not others a few miles away , @entity126 said			0
that disparity is common with lake - effect snow , with official advisories warning about rapidly changing conditions and noting that " the weather can vary from locally heavy snow in narrow bands to clear skies just a few miles away			1
" @entity1 's @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 contributed to this report			0

@entity2 could have done a better job , a spokesman says
@entity160 is reopened at 6 a.m. friday
a lake - effect snow warning continues into the *afternoon*
some motorists have been stranded since thursday
