@entity3 , center , and his wife , @entity11 , enter the courthouse in the @entity13 last month			1
" we are disappointed to hear about the alleged juror misconduct since we know that the @entity18 government , the court , the other jurors and @entity3 as the victim want to have this matter adjudicated through the judicial system , " @entity14 said late wednesday night			1
" mr. @entity3 has and will continue to cooperate with the @entity18 authorities in the prosecution of the defendants for extortion			1
" the @entity18 judge said she believed someone in the jury had had inappropriate communications outside of the jury room , where jurors had been deliberating for eight hours			1
the judge received information that an announcement had been made at a local political rally that one of the defendants had been found not guilty			1
@entity39 , a paramedic , and former @entity18 sen. @entity41 -- who also is @entity42 's lawyer -- are charged with trying to extort money from @entity3 after his son @entity45 's death from a seizure on january 2			1

@entity3 refused a demand for money			1
@entity42 and @entity55 have pleaded not guilty			0
while lawyers and journalists awaited the verdict wednesday night , they were inundated with calls from colleagues saying that someone at a rally for the @entity64 had announced that party member @entity41 was " free at last			2
" when the courtroom doors opened to a packed crowd , the jury foreman said the jurors needed more time to deliberate			0
but judge @entity69 opted to discharge the jury			2
" about two hours ago , there was an announcement at a particular political party , " she said			2
" it leaves the impression that there may have been a communication in the jury room			0
i am going to discharge you from returning your verdict			0
" she then ordered a retrial			0
" we would have liked to have had a verdict so there would be closure in this case , but we prefer to have a new trial , " said @entity3 's lawyer @entity82			1
" we believe the evidence was very strong and convincing			0
the jury was deliberating for about eight hours			0
... if , in fact , @entity39 or @entity41 were found not guilty , a verdict would have been read hours before this announcement			0
" @entity42 's lawyer @entity94 expressed disappointment over the judge 's ruling , saying the case has been a " financial nightmare			1
" " unfortunately , after a lot of expenses , i 'm very , very disappointed , " he said			0
" i 'm confident that we would have had a favorable verdict			0
" earlier in the trial , @entity3 had testified that his son was found unresponsive by a nanny at home on the island of @entity13 , where the family was spending the @entity111 's holiday			1
@entity3 said he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked			1
@entity3 , who is a pilot , planned to fly his son to a @entity117 , @entity118 , hospital instead of driving him to one in nearby @entity119			1
the actor testified that while he and his wife , actress @entity11 , were riding in the ambulance with their son , they decided to take the teen to the hospital , instead of flying to @entity118			0
at the hospital , @entity3 was told his son " was n't alive , " he said			1
during the ambulance ride , @entity42 asked @entity3 to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability			2
" i received a liability of release document			0
i did not read it			0
@entity137 was of the essence , " @entity3 testified			2
@entity3 testified that he later learned about a demand for $ 25 million			1
if he did n't pay , " stories connected to that document would be sold to the press , " the actor said			0
" the stories would imply the death of my son was intentional and i was culpable somehow			0
" an attorney representing @entity55 and @entity42 asked @entity3 whether the defendants had ever contacted or threatened him directly			2
@entity3 said they had not and that he had heard specifics about the situation through his attorneys			2
@entity3 's attorney @entity152 testified that @entity41 had told him that the " document would show [ @entity3 ] killed his son or was negligent in the death of his son			1
" also , @entity152 told the court that @entity41 had claimed that the form was evidence that @entity3 was " trying to flee the country with his dead son			2
" " i said to mrs. @entity41 , ' what you are doing is a criminal offense -- it 's extortion in the @entity166 , " @entity152 testified			0
@entity152 said he contacted authorities and later met with @entity41 in a @entity169 hotel room for a conversation secretly recorded by @entity18 police			2
