-- @entity2 users may value brevity in their messages , but that does n't mean they do n't think about the social implications of language			2
is this sign sexist ? some say our language should be more inclusive of both genders			2
" ca n't we @entity15 - speakers just agree upon a gender - neutral pronoun ? " attorney @entity13 recently twittered			2
" tired of pc grammar gymnastics			0
" @entity18 is n't alone			0
there have been at least 18 recent tweets about the fact that @entity15 has no grammatically correct substitutes for words like " he , " " him , " and " his " that do not have a gender implied			1
consider the sentence " everyone loves his mother			0
" the word " his " may be seen as both sexist and inaccurate , but replacing it with " his or her " seems cumbersome , and " their " is grammatically incorrect			1
" i find myself spending a lot of time reworking or obsessing over sentences to avoid sexist language , and wonder why we settled on these burdensome conventions rather than popularizing a gender - neutral pronoun , " @entity18 said in an e-mail			0
it turns out that an @entity15 speaker 's mind ca n't instantly adopt an imposed new gender - neutral system of pronouns , linguists say			1
a sudden change in the system of pronouns or other auxiliary words in any language is very difficult to achieve			1
that 's because pronouns are " function words , " which connect words and phrases but do not have " content " meanings			1
while new nouns like " cyberspace " and verbs like " to google " become widespread fairly quickly -- and people often come up with synonyms for " cool " -- it 's much more difficult to introduce or change function words			1
the mind just wo n't incorporate them			0
" the function words form a closed club that resists new members , " @entity73 linguist @entity72 writes in his book " @entity75			1
" proposals for gender - neutral pronouns in @entity15 began cropping up in the 19th century -- not for reasons of equality , but for the sake of grammatical correctness , said @entity85 , professor of @entity15 and linguistics at the @entity87 at @entity87			1
more than 100 such proposals , including " thon " and " ip , " have arisen , and none of them has stuck			0
it was n't until the 1970s that the issue became about equality for women , @entity85 said			0
today , internet forums such as @entity2 are buzzing about why @entity15 does n't have a good substitute for " they , " and what could be done about it			0
transgender groups have also taken an interest in the topic -- in fact , the @entity105 at the @entity106 has a gender - neutral pronoun system in its @entity109			0
if there were a deeply felt need for gender - neutral pronouns , they would arise naturally and become widespread through popular culture rather than through an educational or governmental mandate , @entity85 said			2
but , for now , many people continue to write the phrase " him or her			0
" ireport.com : sneak a peek at a ' @entity123 ' gathering of @entity2 users " does it make our culture less sexist ? probably not			0
but it 's a nice gesture , " he said			0
signs of sensitivity while everyone knows that " @entity134 " means " people working , " studies have shown that gendered words do make a difference in how we perceive things , said @entity140 , assistant professor of linguistics at the @entity142			1
" if you ask children to draw ' cavemen , ' they do draw cave men , " she said			0
the issue has public policy implications , too			0
in response to a complaint from a local magazine editor , the public works commissioner for @entity153 , @entity154 , replaced 50 " @entity156 " signs with signs that said " workers ahead " last year and encouraged contractors to use only the gender - neutral signs , said spokeswoman @entity160			1
replacing the signs cost less than $ 1,000 total , she said			2
" there are many women who work in public works , and we want to be respectful and sensitive to the fact that they 're out there , too , doing the hard construction work , " she said			0
ireport.com : share your ' tweeting ' tips , tech obsessions @entity176 , a writer from @entity177 , @entity178 , who recently twittered about gender - neutral pronouns , said words like " mailman " and " fireman " have fallen out of use , in favor of " mail carrier " and " firefighter			1
" the " biggest dilemma " is the gender - specific pronoun ( he or she ) issue , she said			0
the words that stay , the words that go the pronouns " i " and " we " are some of the most ancient words , supporting the idea that function words are very resistant to change			1
new research from @entity200 suggests that these words , along with the numbers one , two , three and five , have been fairly consistent for thousands of years			1
researchers used a supercomputer to look at how words have been used throughout the centuries across the @entity208 family , which includes @entity15 , the romance languages , the slavic languages , and @entity213 tongues such as @entity214			2
an obvious example of the preservation of an ancient word is " two			1
" in @entity219 it 's " dos , " in @entity220 it 's " dva , " in @entity221 it 's " do " and in @entity214 it 's " do " -- all of which are strikingly similar ways of denoting the number two			0
" we could time travel and have very limited conversation , " said @entity228 , evolutionary biologist at the @entity229 in the @entity200 , who led the study			0
" we really believe that we can probably go back 20,000 years with those really , really old words			1
" adjectives and verbs , on the other hand , change much more rapidly			1
the first one to go extinct will be the adjective " dirty , " which will cease to be used to mean " unclean " in 750 years , @entity228 said			1
other candidates for extinction are the verbs to " turn , " " push , " stab , " " squeeze , " and " throw			2
" " to push " will likely go out of use in 850 years , @entity228 said			2
that 's because these words have a very high rate of change , according to the computer model			1
try translating them into other @entity208 , and you come up with very different results			0
for instance , already there are 46 unrelated ways of saying " dirty " in the @entity208 , a clear signal that in @entity15 it will fall out of use relatively quickly .			2

linguists : pronouns are more resistant to change than verbs , nouns
the city of @entity153 removed 50 " @entity156 " signs last year
some of the most ancient words are " i , " " we , " " two , " " three , " and " five "
the word " dirty " will go out of use as the way to say " unclean " in 750 years
