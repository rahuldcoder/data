@entity0 , @entity1 -- frustrated @entity1 officials sunday demanded the federal government approve their plans to dredge up walls of sand to protect delicate inland estuaries from the @entity10 oil spill			1
" either the @entity14 has to side with its @entity16 citizens and protect its communities , or it has to side with a major world corporation named @entity19 and betray @entity16 citizens in that process , " @entity12 president @entity11 told reporters			0
with oil sloshing ashore along the state 's barrier islands and seeping into marshes around the mouth of the @entity29 , state and parish leaders want to use dredges to close channels between the @entity10 and the coastal estuaries			1
they said those plans have been held up by the @entity34 and the agencies in charge of the spill response , including the @entity14 and @entity19 , the company responsible for the spill			1
@entity14 rear adm. @entity40 , the federal on - scene coordinator for the response effort , told reporters the barrier island project was still under review			0
environmental and wildlife officials " are weighing in on the impact to endangered and threatened species and other impacts this large - scale project could have , " she said			2
but @entity52 president @entity51 pointed to pictures of an oil - covered pelican nesting ground and asked reporters , " is it affected now ? " thousands of barrels of oil a day have been spewing into the @entity10 since late april , when the @entity19 - contracted drilling rig @entity61 blew up and sank about 45 miles off @entity1			1
beyond the state 's barrier islands lie a filigree of marshlands , bayous and islands that are rich in wildlife and fisheries that represent the source of about a third of the @entity16 seafood industry			2
@entity72 , mayor of the town of @entity74 , said the dredging plan is " the only plan that 'll possibly work " to save those estuaries			2
" it 's the plan that will save the wildlife , save the marine life and also the way of life for the town of @entity74 and all the coastal communities , " @entity72 said			2
@entity51 , @entity84 and other representatives of the state 's coastal parishes toured the threatened region with gov. @entity89 on sunday			1
@entity89 said his state needs " a greater sense of urgency " from those in charge of the cleanup , or for them to delegate authority to regional officials			1
he said the state is already doing preparatory work for dredging and could begin operations immediately on receiving approval			2
" ten days later , you 'll see land being built			0
you 'll literally see sand being built along these critical passes , " he said			0
mayors and parish presidents were critical of both the government and @entity19 's handling of the cleanup , recounting stories of misdirected protective booms or skimmers that sat on trucks ashore			1
and a visibly angry @entity11 said the delays threatened his parish 's ecosystem and the livelihoods of his people			0
" i do n't have a crystal ball , " he said			0
" but if i were a betting man , i would be betting that the plan is to let us die , then come back and do $ 75 million worth of cleanup and close the book			1
" he said some officials had even suggested setting oil - soaked marshes ablaze , a step he called " not an option for us			0
" " that kills our hurricane protection			0
it wipes out our species , our ecosystem and everything we 've been fighting to protect , " he said .			0
