in what it called the " largest amount of financial relief ever obtained for deceptive charitable fundraising , " the @entity1 state attorney general 's office has reached a nearly $ 25 million settlement with one of the nation 's biggest direct - mail companies			1
the settlement calls for damages of just under $ 10 million and forgiveness of debt for another $ 13.8 million against @entity14 , whose clients include some of the nation 's most well - known charities			1
a three - year @entity20 investigation into @entity14 and its profiteering off donations made to @entity23 veterans has led to a fine that @entity1 regulators say is precedent - setting			1
this potentially could change how professional fundraisers operate in the state of @entity1 and possibly the entire country			0
the total settlement prevents @entity31 from engaging in what it calls a " funded model " of beginning new charities -- paying all of the start - up costs and fundraising costs in advance in hopes of profit down the road			2
in particular , the settlement zeroes in on @entity31 's relationship with a charity based in @entity45 called the @entity46 , founded in 2007			2
after direct - mail payments , little left for veterans @entity20 has been reporting on @entity31 and the veterans foundation since the fall of 2010 , broadcasting a series of reports that showed the charity sending practically all of the millions it raised back to @entity31 as payment for the direct - mail campaign			1
almost none of the cash left over went to veterans , the @entity20 investigation found			1
as a result of @entity20 's reporting , the @entity61 began an investigation of @entity31 and the veterans foundation			1
so did the @entity1 state attorney general 's office			0
the @entity61 investigation is ongoing , according to a spokesman for the committee			0
the @entity1 state investigation found that for all intents and purposes , the charity was a front for @entity31			1
" from the very beginning , " the state said , " the investigation found @entity46 lacked independence from its principal fundraiser , @entity31			1
@entity31 's lawyer 's got the charity up and running and drafted the fundraising counsel agreement that @entity46 signed			0
" in all , the charity raised $ 116 million since 2008 but returned $ 104 million of it to @entity31 , according to the attorney general			2
and of that leftover funds , much of it was sent in the form of donations that one prosecutor said was " dreck " -- @entity91 candy , chef 's hats and coats and leftover shoes that no one wanted			1
the settlement was signed by @entity1 state attorney general @entity98			0
state attorney : actions were ' pretty despicable ' " to take the money that people are trying to spend to help disabled veterans just to feed your own overhead and to pay off your executives as @entity31 did here is pretty despicable , " @entity98 told @entity20			2
@entity109 president and ceo @entity108 said in a statement that he has " taken responsibility for the mistakes that were made " in its dealings with the veterans charity			0
" we deeply apologize for our actions and for any adverse impact they may have had on our industry , " he said			0
@entity108 also said his uncle , @entity122 , had resigned as the company 's chairman of the board			0
under terms of the settlement , the founding board members of the charity are resigning and the charity can no longer do business with @entity31 for three years unless the company is a legitimate low bidder and prosecutors agree			2
a spokesman for the @entity46 , @entity135 , said the settlement " actually strengthens " the charity			0
it was n't just veterans ; it was also @entity140 children			0
