an 81 - ball century from @entity12 -- the fastest by a @entity13 at a @entity14 -- and 92 from captain @entity15 laid the foundations for @entity1 's formidable total of 332 for seven			1
the pair shared a third wicket partnership of 179 as @entity7 's bowling attack toiled after earlier restricting @entity1 to 92 for two from the first 20 overs			1
sehwag century sets up @entity24 victory @entity12 finally fell at the end of the 44th over with the score on 276 for four			0
but @entity28 and @entity29 chipped in with useful runs at the death to steer @entity1 past 300			2
@entity7 's theoretical run - chase got off to the worst of starts as opener @entity34 was out to the seventh ball of the innings , bowled by @entity38			0
fellow opener @entity39 , @entity41 and @entity42 all fell cheaply , leaving @entity7 in the mire at 42 for four after 18 overs			0
captain @entity45 halted a complete collapse with steady 22 before becoming @entity38 's third victim			0
and @entity48 battled hard for his 37 as wickets tumbled around him , but was eighth man out in the 31st over			0
@entity7 's miserable day was completed five overs later when they were all out for 122 -- @entity53 was last man out bowled by @entity54 for four			0
@entity1 's next match is against @entity56 in @entity57 on saturday february 26			1
earlier in @entity6 , @entity58 thrashed minnows @entity60 by 10 wickets in @entity62			1
@entity60 won the toss and elected to bat and made a respectable if somewhat slow start to their innings , scoring 33 runs in the first ten overs for the loss of one wicket -- opener @entity72 falling to @entity74 in the seventh over			1
@entity76 excited to host @entity14 but it was n't long before their innings began to unravel as @entity80 paceman @entity79 -- who finished with figures of 4 for 16 -- ripped through @entity60 's top order with only @entity83 ( 16 not out ) offering any resistance			2
@entity60 's last five batsmen managed just four runs between them as @entity87 and @entity74 bagged three wickets apiece as @entity60 slumped to 69 all out in the 24th over			2
@entity90 openers @entity89 ( 39 not out ) and @entity91 ( 26 not out ) needed just eight overs to knock off the runs as @entity58 romped home			2
tougher opposition awaits for @entity58 next friday as they face arch rivals @entity97 in @entity98 .			0

@entity1 's @entity12 scores a rapid hundred to set up 210 - run win
@entity58 *record* thumping 10 - wicket win over @entity60
@entity60 *skittled* out for just 69 with @entity80 openers knocking off runs in eight overs
