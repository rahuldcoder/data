-- @entity1 played a starring role against his former club @entity3 to keep @entity5 champion @entity6 in touch with the @entity9 leaders sunday			1
the veteran midfielder scored a free - kick and hit the bar with another , allowing @entity14 to volley what would be the decisive goal for a 3 - 1 lead			2
@entity3 , down to 10 men by that stage after defender @entity20 was sent off for protesting his initial booking , reduced the deficit through @entity24 's second of the match at the end			2
it left @entity6 in third place on goal difference behind @entity29 , which also remained unbeaten following a 4 - 0 win at home to @entity32			1
both clubs trail @entity34 by two points , following the capital club 's saturday win at @entity38			1
former @entity38 midfielder @entity24 gave @entity3 the lead inside 30 seconds , but @entity1 -- who spent a decade at the @entity40 -- equalized after 15 minutes with a set - piece that goalkeeper @entity42 could only deflect into the net			1
substitute @entity44 put @entity6 ahead in the 69th minute from @entity46 's pass , soon after his arrival on the pitch , and then @entity20 ' moment of madness was to prove vital for @entity3 as @entity14 immediately capitalized			1
the defeat left the seven - time @entity53 champion languishing in 12th place , some 13 points adrift of @entity34			1
@entity29 , like @entity6 , has six wins and a draw from seven matches , continuing new coach @entity60 's fine start			1
former @entity62 striker @entity61 was again missing due to injury , but the @entity64 had too much firepower for @entity32			0
striker @entity66 followed up last weekend 's double against @entity68 with another goal , while midfielder @entity71 's speculative long - range shot went through keeper @entity72 before @entity73 and @entity74 netted in the second half			0
@entity76 moved up to fifth with a 4 - 1 win at @entity78 , climbing above @entity79 and @entity80 -- who drew 0 - 0 in @entity82			0
@entity83 claimed eighth with a 2 - 0 win at home to @entity86 , while @entity87 went top of the @entity9 scoring charts with a penalty in ninth - placed @entity92 's 2 - 2 draw at @entity93			1
the @entity95 winger now has six goals , putting him one ahead of @entity74 and @entity79 's @entity98			0
in @entity100 , @entity99 moved to the top of the @entity102 scoring charts with both goals in @entity105 's 2 - 1 win over @entity106 on sunday			1
the @entity108 - born striker , who is hoping to qualify to play for his adopted country , moved two clear of @entity111 's @entity110 on 10 goals but could have had more after missing a first - half penalty			0
@entity105 kept pace with @entity111 , as both clubs have eight wins from eight this season			0
@entity118 moved up to fifth place with a 3 - 1 win at home to @entity122 , as winger @entity123 scored twice in the first 22 minutes before striker @entity124 added another soon after			2
@entity125 and @entity126 also have 13 points following a 1 - 1 draw in the @entity130 capital , but trail @entity118 on goal difference			0
@entity132 moved away from the relegation with a 2 - 1 win over bottom club @entity135			2
in @entity138 , defending champion @entity136 kept level on points with this season 's leader @entity141 after battling to a 2 - 1 win at third - placed @entity144			1
@entity136 had @entity145 sent off for a foul that allowed @entity147 to net a 34th - minute penalty , but equalized on halftime through @entity151 's header			2
@entity152 then scored a second - half spotkick after @entity147 fouled @entity154 , extending his team 's unbeaten run to 20 league matches			0
in @entity159 , @entity158 moved out of the @entity160 's bottom three with a 5 - 0 win at @entity162 to give former @entity164 coach @entity163 his first win since taking charge			0
@entity159 under - 21 striker @entity167 netted a hat - trick in eight second - half minutes			0
bottom club @entity169 came from behind to draw 1 - 1 at home to @entity171 .			0
