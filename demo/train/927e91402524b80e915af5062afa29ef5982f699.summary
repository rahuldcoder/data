-- until the rerun of the @entity4 elections scheduled for june 17 , we will witness an unprecedented game of brinkmanship			1
the game will be played along the following lines			0
@entity10 political leaders will state unequivocally to the @entity4 electorate that it is time for them to make a stark choice : vote for parties that will continue with the agreed reforms ( the dreaded austerity ) and stay within the @entity10 family or vote for parties opposed to the austerity measures and leave the euro and perhaps the @entity21			1
fear and confusion rule as @entity4 faces uncertain future this clear and concise message was recently voiced by @entity27 finance minister @entity26			2
she declared that if @entity4 does not stick to the terms of its bailout program , it will not receive further aid from the @entity21 or the @entity32			1
" one can not exit from the eurozone , one can only exit from the @entity21 , " she said			2
she also noted that @entity4 would have to reapply for @entity21 membership , with no guarantee of readmission			1
@entity37 : @entity4 banks strain for cash @entity4 politicians , particularly @entity42 leader @entity41 , will probably respond to that message with a different one , which he will transmit back to @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 ( home of the @entity50 ) : @entity10 can not afford to let @entity4 fail and therefore , in the name of solidarity , @entity10 must continue to do whatever it takes to support @entity4			2
but this time it should not require @entity4 to take such painful measures			2
oh , and @entity10 will need to give @entity4 additional funds ( in the name of " growth " ) no matter what combination of political parties enters parliament and forms a new government			2
the trillion dollar question : will @entity4 exit the euro ? sounding like a blackmailer , @entity41 has said , " the eurozone is not in danger because of @entity4 resistance , but because of the bankrupt policies of the memorandum , of yesterday 's political system " ; " if the disease of austerity destroys @entity4 , it will spread to the rest of @entity10 " ; and " the @entity10 leadership and especially mrs. @entity80 need to stop playing poker with the lives of people			1
" perhaps it is fitting that a great test of democracy is taking place in democracy 's birthplace			1
so , who blinks first ? in the past three days , we have seen two actors blink immediately : @entity90 chancellor @entity80 and @entity4 and @entity92 bank depositors			2
the consummate political tactician , @entity80 understood that with @entity98 president @entity97 's electoral victory on sunday , @entity95 prime minister @entity94 's continued public pressure and her party 's recent electoral loss to the social democrats in the largest @entity90 state , the political winds were shifting at home and abroad on growth			1
this week , @entity80 confessed that she was in fact in favor of identifying additional growth measures when she said she was in a " high level of agreement " with @entity97			0
she noted that for " stimulus to be pursued for growth in the euro zone , which we could pursue in the interest of @entity4 , we 're open for this			2
@entity90 is open for this			0
" of course , details and date of delivery of said growth remain a mystery			0
@entity4 and @entity92 depositors were the second actor to blink when they removed approximately â ‚ ¬ 700 million ( about $ 890 million @entity124 ) from @entity4 banks and â ‚ ¬ 1 billion ( about $ 1.26 billion @entity124 ) from @entity92 's third - largest and recently nationalized bank , @entity126			1
their actions were indicative of the fear that the game of chicken is getting out of hand			0
this sentiment was strengthened by @entity50 president @entity134 's decision to cut off certain @entity4 banks from receiving @entity50 funds and the @entity32 's announcement , earlier friday , that it would freeze contacts with @entity4 until the june 17 election			1
the ultimate answer to " who blinks first " lies in understanding how this crisis has played out over the past two years			0
diplomatic marathon : @entity144 focusing on @entity4 ; @entity145 , on @entity146 the @entity4 bailout package has already been renegotiated twice , most recently in march of this year , to address deteriorating economic fundamentals and to force private bondholders to take losses			1
there have been no less than 17 @entity10 summits to " resolve " the crisis only to return to crisis shortly thereafter			2
three bailout packages ( @entity4 , @entity156 and @entity157 ) ; â ‚ ¬ 1.3 trillion ( $ 1.65 trillion @entity124 ) in cheap , three - year loans to @entity10 banks ; and a change in government in 10 out of the 17 eurozone countries -- the art of the @entity10 muddle - through strategy has been perfected			1
it is clear from tuesday 's meeting between @entity80 and @entity97 that @entity10 will continue to actively pursue this muddle - through strategy until it is no longer able to pursue it			0
the treaties , the summitry and the political volatility that define @entity10 are completely ill - equipped to handle the crisis as it enters a new and potentially determinate end state			0
most important , the collateral damage that comes with muddling through for the past two years is taking a significant social and economic toll : @entity92 unemployment is at almost 25 % ; @entity4 youth unemployment is at 51.5 % and a third of the @entity98 electorate in the first round of its presidential elections voted for either an extreme left or right party			1
is @entity10 willing to be home to a lost generation in the name of @entity10 solidarity ? no one knows how this brinkmanship will come to an end , or even if it will come to an end at all			0
and certainly no one knows whether it will result in economic armageddon or a small blip on a trader 's computer screen			0
actions or statements by either side are likely not to be conclusive			0
it is more likely that a sudden , unanticipated shock created by either the markets or political actors before june 17 causes an unstoppable chain reaction			1
should this be this outcome , in some way it may come as a relief as it is far easier to blame an event than to accept responsibility for @entity10 's actions over the past two years			0
this game of chicken is not unique to @entity10			0
@entity215 had its own bout of brinkmanship last summer regarding the increase in @entity124 's debt ceiling , and is likely to have it again in a few months			0
@entity10 has just upped the level of play			0
what does it mean to be @entity4 right now ? share your story with us on @entity228 ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			1

@entity231 says the @entity21 is on the brink over @entity4 's economic crisis
if @entity4 does *n't* stick to its bailout terms , it may not receive further @entity21 aid , she says
a great test of democracy is taking place in democracy 's birthplace , @entity241 says
@entity241 : @entity248 may conclude on june 17 , when @entity4 's electoral *re-run* is scheduled
