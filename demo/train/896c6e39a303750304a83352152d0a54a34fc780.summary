@entity1 's populist supporters are finding inspiration from an unlikely source : @entity5			0
@entity5 , the head of investment banking at @entity7 and president @entity9 's pick for a top spot at the @entity11 , was forced to withdraw his nomination last month after facing an onslaught of public opposition led by @entity15 , the popular liberal @entity16 senator			1
if this was a remarkable defeat for the @entity9 administration , it was a moment of glowing achievement for some of @entity15 's fiercest backers , including @entity25 reform advocates and progressive grassroots leaders who aggressively criticized @entity5 's work at @entity7			1
emboldened by their successful thwarting of his nomination and @entity15 's growing clout , liberal activists are energized about their role in @entity35 this year			1
despite @entity37 being relegated to minority status in the @entity39 and @entity40 , these groups still think they can make a big splash			1
they 're preparing to publicly clash with the administration on future presidential nominees and big - ticket items such as the @entity47 trade deal			2
they 're also looking to pressure @entity9 to take a tougher stance on expansion of overtime pay and developing stricter rules for brokers on @entity25			2
by simultaneously mobilizing supporters from the ground up and seizing on @entity15 's rise in national politics , the @entity16 senator 's backers are determined to make @entity5 just the first of many casualties			1
" this was a really important part of us building momentum against the @entity25 wing of the @entity37 and really supporting the @entity15 wing , " said @entity61 , executive director of @entity62			1
" what was exciting about @entity5 is we took our first victim			0
" the monthslong crusade against @entity5 captured how progressive activists are using @entity15 's star power to elevate their core issues			1
@entity15 is the subject of persistent rumors that she 'll run for president in 2016			1
she insists she 's not running for higher office , but her stature among progressives is immense			2
after @entity9 nominated @entity5 , 48 , to be @entity11 's undersecretary for domestic finance in november , groups such as @entity84 , @entity62 and the @entity85 quickly mobilized			1
they blasted out emails to supporters , launched online petitions and took to social media to oppose @entity5 's nomination			0
their single most important tool for mobilizing mass support ? @entity15			2
progressive groups did n't just call on supporters to oppose @entity5 ; instead , they insisted that protesting his nomination was a way of showing solidarity with @entity15			1
" stand with @entity1 and say no to a @entity25 banker for @entity11 undersecretary , " read a @entity84 petition against @entity5 's nomination , which garnered more than 30,000 signatures			1
@entity62 urged its members to call the @entity39 and say no to the @entity5 nomination -- not just because @entity5 was too friendly with @entity25 , but because blocking his nomination was an important mission for @entity15			2
" sen. @entity15 is leading the charge against the nomination of @entity5 , " the group said			1
" she needs your help to stop him			0
" it was n't a complete victory -- when he eventually withdrew his nomination last month , @entity5 was offered the role of adviser to treasury secretary @entity118			0
but for @entity15 's supporters , sinking @entity5 's nomination was validation of the progressive movement 's sway in @entity35			1
it was also proof of how much @entity15 's popularity with voters can help maximize the progressive wing 's influence			1
a @entity15 spokesperson declined to comment for this story			2
with the 2016 presidential election looming , liberal activists are eager to piggyback on the continuing buzz about a @entity133 bid and make the senator a mascot for some of their top policy and legislative priorities			0
for starters , they are prepared to sound the alarm if another presidential nominee does n't meet their approval			0
the @entity145 's @entity144 has one vacancy in need of a nomination , and it 's unclear when the administration plans to nominate someone new for the undersecretary for domestic finance role			0
if the administration were to handpick another nominee perceived as being too close to @entity25 , financial reform groups can expect to have a powerful ally on their side : community banks			0
@entity159 , the ceo of the @entity160 who opposed @entity5 's nomination , said his group 's view is simple : " we do n't want all the nominees to be straight out of @entity25			0
" " we 're looking for nominees that have experience with midsized and smaller institutions , " @entity159 said			0
" the litmus test is : how well rounded are those nominees ? " progressive groups are also taking issue with one of the president 's top priorities for his final years in office : the @entity47 , a huge trade agreement proposal between the @entity178 and 11 countries			1
groups such as @entity84 have opposed these talks , taking issue with what they say are " secret " negotiations and the unfair advantages that large corporations would reap from the pact			0
" to protect consumers and to address sources of systemic financial risk , @entity188 must maintain the flexibility to impose restrictions on harmful financial products and on the conduct or structure of financial firms			0
we would oppose including provisions in the @entity47 that would limit that flexibility , " the senator wrote in a letter to @entity178 trade representative @entity200 in december			2
liberal activists also have their sights set on unilateral actions the @entity9 administration could take and bypass the @entity208 - controlled @entity188 , such as expanding overtime pay and creating stricter oversight of @entity25 brokers			0
on both of these issues , they also have the support of their favorite @entity37 senator			0
" our members love her , " said @entity216 , executive director of civic action at @entity84 .			0

the progressive wing of the @entity37 feels like sen. @entity15 has muscle to flex
being able to thwart president @entity9 's @entity11 nominee has emboldened them
progressives take issue with one of @entity9 's high priorities : the @entity47
