@entity0 -- for many children fighting cancer , it can be extremely tough to make it to their chemotherapy appointments			1
two - year - old @entity7 has neuroblastoma and must travel as much as six times a week to @entity10 in @entity0			0
but her mother does n't have a car , and @entity7 's compromised immune system means public transportation is off - limits			1
that 's where @entity17 comes in			1
@entity17 , who lost his son , @entity19 , to cancer in 2000 , started a program called " ride with @entity19 " to provide transportation for low - income families and their children battling cancer			1
" no child should miss their cancer treatment due to lack of transportation , " @entity17 says			1
@entity7 is now one of hundreds of patients who receive free rides to and from treatments			1
" they help me out so much , " says @entity34 , @entity7 's single mother of two who receives eight to 10 rides per week			1
" they 're very clean , they 're sanitized ... they are always organized and on time			0
i do n't know what i would do without them			0
" @entity17 knows firsthand what these families are going through			1
in march 1998 , his 3 - year - old son was diagnosed with leukemia , thrusting the family into a world of constant treatments , hospital visits and tests			1
fortunately , he and his wife had a large support system , flexible jobs and understanding employers			0
" we had rides to the hospital to bring @entity19 , " he said			1
" we had our brothers and sisters and neighbors bring us hot meals			0
" but @entity17 met many families along the way who did n't have such support : single moms forced to take leave from jobs without pay , kids having to ride the bus alone to their chemotherapy appointments , siblings left home alone			1
@entity17 said it broke his heart			1
" it 's extremely tough , not just emotionally , but now financially , " he said			2
" sometimes , both parents have to either leave their job or cut back severely			0
some ... do n't have ( an ) extra $ 10 to pay for cafeteria food			0
" when @entity19 died , his father decided he had watched too many people struggle			2
he went back to @entity10 , where @entity19 had received most of his treatment , and asked how he could help			2
" transportation , " they said			0
so @entity17 started picking up families in his old @entity89			1
" i was going every day , picking up families all over the county , " he said			0
soon , however , @entity17 could n't handle the number of requests that were coming in			2
so he teamed up with nurses and social workers from @entity96 to create a formal transportation program			0
he hired a driver , formalized a schedule for pickups and drop - offs and started the @entity102 in 2003			0
one of the first children @entity17 helped was a 1 - year - old boy with a brain tumor who required frequent chemotherapy treatments			1
with no car , the boy 's mother had to leave her home at 4 a.m. and take four buses to get her son to an 8:30 a.m. appointment			2
" it was over four hours one way by bus , " @entity17 said			2
" and after the whole day of chemotherapy , it was the same amount of time back			0
" @entity17 and his foundation stepped in , saving them a significant amount of travel time each day			2
today , @entity17 ' group provides more than 2,500 rides a year , traveling more than 70,000 miles			1
it operates out of @entity96 and @entity126 @entity10			0
in addition to the free rides , @entity17 ' nonprofit provides support services and assistance to its clientele , many of whom do not speak @entity135			1
@entity136 ' group offers translation services and an on - site resource center at @entity96 to help them navigate the often - complex insurance systems , legal issues and medical diagnoses			0
" most of the families that we 're dealing with are not just low - income , but they are living in poverty , " @entity17 said			1
on saturday , @entity136 will begin his " @entity148 " fundraiser to help children fighting cancer			2
he will run 700 miles over 30 days , starting in @entity151 and ending in @entity0			0
he says his work not only saves children 's lives , but it keeps @entity19 's memory alive as well			1
" he really is the force , " @entity17 said			2
" even though he 's been passed away almost 13 years , it 's still like he 's with me			0
like he 's still on my shoulder or still pulling my ear like he used to			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity102 website at @entity161 and see how to help .			0

@entity17 organizes free rides to the hospital for poor children with cancer
many children and their families find it *difficult* to get reliable , *affordable* transportation
@entity17 lost his own son , @entity19 , to leukemia in 2000 : " it 's like he 's still with me "
