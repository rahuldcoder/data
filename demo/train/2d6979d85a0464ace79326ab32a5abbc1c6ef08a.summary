the military released a statement saying @entity32 now has the powers to act as prime minister until a new one takes office			2

it 's the second coup for @entity92 , a lifelong @entity94 resident and @entity95			1
while there are noticeable differences -- like closed convenience stores -- he said most people do n't seem too taken aback but the sudden , if hardly unprecedented , political shift			2
" people associate this as the silent coup			1
they just go home and do n't go out after 10 , " he said			0
" ... people just live their normal lives			1
" @entity109 bill furor spirals into more unrest in a way , if not years in the making , the latest coup has been in the making since november			0

a military coup deposed @entity119 in 2006			1
groups opposed to the government seized on the amnesty bill furor and began large - scale protests in central areas of @entity94			1

but the @entity18 boycotted the february race , and @entity116 's foes blocked voting in enough districts to prevent a valid outcome			0
@entity116 , who first took office in 2011 , stayed on after the disrupted election as a caretaker prime minister			0
but the @entity137 forced her from office two weeks ago , finding her guilty -- despite her professions of innocence -- of violating the constitution over the appointments of top security officials			2

the situation has n't calmed much since @entity116 's departure from office			0
