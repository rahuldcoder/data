many climbers dream of reaching the peak of the world 's highest mountain at least once in their lifetime			0
@entity5 has done it twice -- in one week			1
@entity7 formally recognized the 29 - year - old 's achievement last week , though it 's been almost one year since she completed her historic double climb			1
" people have set different kinds of climbing records in @entity20 , " said @entity5 , sitting on her living room couch directly beneath a string of certificates hung on the wall -- the @entity7 plaque included			1
" but no one has climbed twice within a week			1
so i just climbed with the sole motive of making a world record			2
" @entity5 made her initial ascent on may 12 and then , after a two - day rest on her return to base camp , reached the peak again on may 19 , 2012			1
since @entity31 and sir @entity32 broke barriers by stepping afoot the 8,848 - meter peak in 1953 , many benchmarks have been set			0
but for @entity5 , it was @entity36 -- the first @entity38 woman to climb @entity20 ( she died during her descent ) -- who inspired the then fifth grader to sketch a future plan that most girls the same age could n't conceive of			1
growing up in @entity47 in north - eastern @entity38 , @entity5 's early romance with mountaineering blossomed when she saw tourists trekking through her village			1
she wanted to do the same			0
" i wanted to carry a backpack and climb the peak [ @entity52 ] i saw from my village , " she said			0
but her eyes were set on @entity20			1
she expected herself to achieve the extraordinary			0
when she came to @entity55 to visit her sister in 2010 , @entity5 enrolled in a basic mountaineering training course run by the @entity58			1
she said it helped her get the " psychological , physical , and technical training " required to prepare for her the mission			0
for the next two years , @entity5 honed her skills in rock climbing and first aid and climbed the @entity65 ( 5,520m ) -- also considered a trekking peak -- in @entity38 's @entity67			1
concerned about the risks and dangers , @entity5 's parents , however , were wary of her planned @entity20 ascent			1
" she was determined , " said @entity72 , her proud father			0
" she was on a quest to do something extraordinary -- it was difficult for us to stop her			0
" while parents and family members kept track of @entity5 throughout her journey , the climber said she detached herself from any emotions			1
" the only thing on my mind was to successfully set the record , " @entity5 said			1
she looked across the couch to her parents , and laughed , " i did n't really think of anyone during the climb , not even myself			0
" on may 12 , when she reached 8,848m for the first time with a group of four other climbers , she stood amazed above the " layer of tiny mountain peaks blanketed by circular cloud patterns			0
" during the 15 minutes she spent on top of the world , @entity5 said she took a moment to thank @entity100 , her parents , and then reminded herself that she had to do it all again			1
after returning to base camp two days later and resting for another two days , @entity5 made the ascent again on may 17			1
but this time , she only had @entity105 , her aid , for company			0
it was 33 - year - old @entity105 's third trip to @entity20			1
he recalled the two - day climb with @entity5 as a " memorable experience			1
" " she 's fit and firm , " he said , adding that he takes pride in being a part of @entity5 's record - setting expedition			2
but for @entity5 , " @entity20 was exhausting			1
" en route to the world 's highest peak , she also traversed the @entity119 at 5,486m as well as the steepest climb after @entity121 ( 7,470m ) , all while carrying 15 kilograms of her expedition gear that she said seemed to weigh more like 50			0
" but i did it -- i reached the summit on may 19 , stood there for a little longer this time , about 25 minutes , and then headed to base camp in a day and a half , " @entity5 said , describing the journey with such ease as if it were a trek for amateurs			2
to date , the total number of people who have successfully climbed @entity20 from the @entity38 side , according to the @entity134 at the @entity135 , stands at 3,842			1
of them only 219 are women , out of whom a mere 21 are @entity38			0
" i really want other @entity38 women to get involved in mountaineering , " @entity5 said			2
" we should have a can - do attitude so that we can move forward and not be left behind simply because we 're women			0
" though soft - spoken and shy , @entity5 was assertive when she talked about the involvement of women in the country 's tourism sector			2
to her , it 's also of utmost importance for women to become educated			0
though successful in her own right , @entity5 still laments not being able to continue school after eighth grade			2
there was no high school in her village and her family did not have the money to move to @entity55 , or the closest town with a school			0
" but it is n't too late , " @entity5 said			2
currently , she is studying @entity160 at a local language institute in @entity55			0
she believes that the " international language " will further empower women to move forward in the tourism sector			0
it certainly is helping her to work as a tour guide , she added			0
with only two peaks -- @entity168 ( 6,476m ) and @entity169 ( 6,189m ) -- to her credit before @entity20 , she 's since gone on to conquer @entity52			2
@entity171 ( 6,812m ) and @entity172 ( 7,135m ) in @entity173			0
but she 's not finished with @entity20			2
@entity5 wants to climb the summit again from the @entity176 side , as well as ascend @entity52			1
@entity52 , and also the highest peak on every continent			0
her father said he " could n't be happier or more proud " to see one of his eight children achieve something no one else has			0
for @entity5 , it 's the world record that matters -- it 's a testament of her determination to succeed in her mission			2
as she held her framed world record certificate to pose for a photograph , @entity5 said , " i have created a name for myself and i have raised my country 's profile			2
if you 're really determined , you can definitely take yourself to new heights , and that 's what i 've done			1

sherpa made the double climb last may after years of preparation
she says : " if you 're really determined , you can definitely take yourself to new heights "
