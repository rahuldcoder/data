@entity3 , @entity4 -- " what is it like to bury both of my kids ? " @entity8 's voice trails off , unable to continue			1
she sits in the same pew of her church , listening to the same pastor on the same subject -- the loss of a child			1
her two boys , @entity16 and @entity17 , were shot to death , 19 days apart , young victims of @entity3 , @entity4 's relentless street violence			1
with a population of nearly 400,000 , @entity3 has long been known as a @entity23 pocket of urban violence			1
its proximity to drug corridors and high poverty are fertile breeding grounds for gang violence			2
nearby @entity30 and @entity31 are routinely named " @entity37 in @entity38 , " yet @entity3 makes it on very different lists with one of the highest gang homicide rates and robbery levels in the country			1
last year , @entity3 police touted a 28 % drop in murders , the biggest reduction in homicides since 2004			1
after two years of rising death tolls , @entity3 's police chief credited the drop in homicides -- from 131 in 2012 to 90 in 2013 -- to the city 's violence reduction strategy which targets the most violent gangs			1
but because of @entity3 's size , its reduced homicide rate still makes it one of the most dangerous cities in the country , with a murder every four days			1
after riots , @entity4 city gets new police chief @entity8 's youngest son , @entity59 , died on january 1 , @entity3 's first murder of 2014			1
a gunman approached the 13 - year - old on @entity63 as he walked home from the @entity65 , and shot him 28 times			1
teachers , family members and others who knew him best say @entity16 was n't in a gang			2
the eighth grader loved to play drums in band			2
neighbors said @entity16 was a good boy			2
he stayed at home playing video games or hung out at the @entity65 , while his single mother worked as a social worker			2
it 's unclear why @entity16 was targeted			2
surveillance video turned over to @entity3 police shows him walking down the street , his youth apparent in his gait			1
he was walking home from the bus stop			2
usually he called his mom to pick him up , but his cell phone battery had died			2
on the video , his mother says you can see a gunman approach , carrying a semi-automatic rifle			2
minority kids impacted by zero - tolerance laws @entity8 was at home , watching local news of the aftermath of another shooting in her neighborhood			1
the report showed video of a gurney being loaded into an ambulance , with the on - screen graphic , " @entity109 shot			1
" she 'd seen it hundreds of times -- just another kid shot in @entity3			1
hours later , she rushed to the hospital with her oldest son @entity17 where she was called to identify @entity16 's body			2
she looked up at a television in the waiting room and saw the local news report again			2
this time it hit her : it was @entity16 in that news report , his body being loaded into the ambulance			2
just a baby , just a baby			2
" another son gunned down @entity127 had started straightening out his life after occasional run - ins with the law , including a stint in juvenile detention			2
the 19 - year - old had been taking classes at the local community college			2
he was close to his younger brother , @entity16 -- so close that the two still slept together in the same bed			2
after @entity16 's death , @entity8 worried about @entity17			1
her youngest son , who was never in trouble , had clearly been a target			2
was it a message to @entity17 ? fearing for her older son 's safety , @entity8 asked @entity17 to leave @entity3			1
but with the bravado of youth , @entity17 convinced his mother he was safe			2
after losing @entity16 , @entity8 wanted to get back into a routine , back to her career as a case worker for the homeless , but says she was exhausted by her grief			1
then , three days after @entity16 's funeral , on january 19 , she asked @entity17 to run an errand for her , to pay her cell phone bill			2
he was two blocks from home when friends started calling her phone			0
there had been gunfire in the neighborhood , they told her			0
@entity8 ran towards the corner , and spotted the yellow police tape			1
" i see my son 's car shot up			1
and i just broke down crying			0
" she could n't approach the car			0
she could see from 20 yards away what had happened			0
" the suspect stood on top of the car and just shot into the car			1
just shot into the car			1
" she called @entity17 repeatedly from her cell phone			0
" there was no logic in it , she says , because she already knew in her heart that @entity17 was gone			0
in 19 days , @entity8 went from a mother of two , to a mother of none			1
@entity3 police will not say whether the murders of @entity8 's sons are gang - related , but because they are brothers , police say their deaths " are possibly related			1
" @entity8 's horror may be extraordinary , but losing a child to gun violence is a common experience in @entity3 , says @entity194			1
" this city is full of mourning mothers , " she says			0
@entity198 's son was shot on a city bus , coming home from school			1
@entity203 ' son @entity202 was not so lucky			0
he was shot and killed on @entity3 's streets six years ago			1
his murder is still unsolved			0
burying your child defies the natural order , says @entity202			0
but she says it 's normal in @entity3			1
" it 's beyond sickening to me , " says @entity202			0
" no parent should ever , ever have to bury their kids			0
i can no longer see mothers bury their kids anymore			0
" @entity202 drops her head , the tears still fresh six years after she buried her son			1
trying to make a difference @entity224 thinks of himself as the mop - up man to @entity3 's violence			1
he often picks up the bodies of young @entity229 - @entity38 men lost to gun violence , after the coroner 's work is complete			1
he plugs the bullet holes with plastic screws so the fluid does n't stain the white satin of the casket , so mothers can see their sons one last time			1
@entity224 estimates he 's put a few hundred children , or " babies " as he calls them , into caskets			1
he picked up both @entity16 and @entity17 's bodies on his gurney			0
" i 'm tired of it , " says @entity224 , 52			0
" i 'm the one who sees them firsthand at the coroner 's office			0
i 'm the one who 's got to identify them right off the top			0
the mother 's calling you : how does their kid look ? sometimes ... the kid 's been shot up so bad they ca n't even identify them			1
" @entity224 held @entity8 's hand as she picked out her second casket this month			1
he 's done this hundreds of times -- but still finds himself at a loss for words			0
" @entity267 n't too much you can say to her			0
" a life - long @entity270 resident , @entity224 also coaches @entity273 football for the neighborhood boys			0
when he started picking up the bodies of the very boys he coached , @entity224 pledged to try and make a difference			0
he began inviting children and their parents into the @entity280 funeral home and walked them through the embalming process			1
during these tours , in which he hopes to show young people the sober reality of life on the streets , @entity224 opens up the empty caskets and closes the lid on the children			1
" that 's how it ends , " he tells the visitors			0
his program , which he now calls @entity294 , or @entity295 , has proven so popular that teachers now invite him to schools			0
for classroom visits , which can be for children as young as kindergarten , @entity224 brings body bags and zips the children inside			1
his message is always the same : there is nothing romantic about guns and street life -- only finality and darkness			0
" gun violence is a regular , everyday thing			0
all these kids do not have an education , but they have a gun			0
and there 's something wrong with that picture			0
... to me , the city is failing these kids , " he says			0
@entity224 says that even the horror of @entity8 's story will fade after @entity17 is buried			1
" a month or two from now , it 'll be over with , " he says			1
" we 'll be talking about something different			0
that 's how it goes , year after year			0
" still , @entity330 is trying to make @entity17 's service special			0
she 's decorating the program in his favorite colors , green and white			0
she 's asked their god - sister to read at the service			0
" i need to bury him right			0
i need to do a good job , " she says			0
new can make it through today			0
the family and the neighborhood will fill the church			0
she 'll have plenty of support for @entity17 's funeral			0
but tomorrow ? she 'll be alone .			0
