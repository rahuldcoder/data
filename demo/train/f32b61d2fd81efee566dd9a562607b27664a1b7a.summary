and @entity7 phenom @entity6 failed to catch fire with audiences in his prime - time major network debut			1
@entity12 reports that @entity13 's " minute to win it " -- a distinctly non- " kulinary " game show that challenges competitors to master stunts like one - handed tissue - box emptying and re-stacking plastic cups -- " did n't put up great overall numbers from 7 to 9 p.m. " on sunday but rallied slightly against other networks ' programming at the 8:30 p.m. mark			1
lukewarm ratings might not relegate most shows to the trash bin , but given how this one underperformed after being so heavily promoted via pricey @entity28 commercial breaks , popular food blogs like " eater " are already predicting the show 's cancellation			0
but it 's not just hard out there for a " gangsta " ; over the past decade , several notable chefs failed to bring the sizzle to the network spotlight			0
with @entity13 set to take another gamble on chef @entity41 's upcoming reality show , " @entity45 , " network execs might wish to take a second look at a few star turns that flamed out fast			2
' @entity46 ' -- @entity47 " @entity50 " host and leather - jacket aficionado @entity47 steamed up bookstore shelves nationwide with his restaurant tell - all " @entity46 : adventures in the @entity54 " in 2000			0
@entity56 's sitcom incarnation , featuring a defanged " @entity57 , " played by @entity58 , replated the book 's sex - drugs - and - rock - ' n ' - roll soul as a sanitized snack of wacky kitchen hijinks and one - note characters			2
after four episodes , the network put it in the deep freeze , airing the remaining nine episodes online and outside the @entity69 ' @entity70 ' -- @entity70 in 2001 , @entity71 ' @entity70 starred in a self - titled sitcom set behind the scenes at a fictional cooking show			1
bereft of his essential " @entity70 ! " and " kick it up a notch " catchphrases and scripted as a watered - down version of his charismatic bayou - blasting @entity7 persona , @entity79 and co-star @entity80 muddled their way through 11 bland , critically panned episodes before @entity13 pulled the plug			1
' @entity88 ' -- @entity89 long before he danced with the stars and shilled for @entity91 , @entity89 was an honest - to - goodness chef at an acclaimed @entity93 restaurant called @entity94			1
this rude , raw , reality show , however , was not set there			0
rather , " the restaurant " -- airing on @entity13 in 2003 - 04 -- documented @entity98 's fraught relationship with restaurateur @entity99 as they made nasty hash opening a joint venture called " @entity89 's			1
" the show , stuffed to the gills with product placements , featured frequent clashes between front - and back - of - house staffs , diners , servers ( hired on - air from a pool of more than 2,000 fame - starved applicants ) , and @entity98 and everyone but his sainted mother , who made the restaurant 's signature meatballs			0
while " @entity88 " made it to a very short second season , a painfully public legal conflict between @entity98 and @entity99 shuttered the restaurant and the show			1
@entity89 has never cooked in a restaurant again			0
' @entity122 ' -- @entity123 " @entity126 ( @entity125 ) " host and @entity125 tabloid staple @entity123 popped across the pond to helm this competitive restaurant reality show for @entity13 in the spring of 2009			0
though mentorship of @entity131 and @entity132 and a spicy biography entitled " @entity134 " established him as a culinary cult favorite , as the show 's host and head judge , @entity123 swapped his legendary scorching temper ( he once allegedly set a young chef on fire for complaining about the kitchen 's temperature ) for a tone so chill , it sent viewers nodding into their sorbet			0
after three episodes , @entity13 placed the show on a back burner , releasing the remainder of the episodes online .			2
