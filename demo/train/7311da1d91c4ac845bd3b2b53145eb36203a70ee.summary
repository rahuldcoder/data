@entity0 -- @entity2 rep. @entity2 of @entity3 is two for two			1
the @entity2 from @entity4 , @entity3 , has successfully appeased @entity5 republicans and engaged president @entity6 in as little as 48 hours			1
a feat near impossible in these times of extreme partisanship			0
after laying low , @entity2 swept into the budget battle crippling @entity0 with a plan to break the stalemate that has resulted in a government shutdown and no agreement so far on avoiding a possible @entity16 debt default			1
with an op - ed and some persuading , he effectively moved demands by tea party aligned @entity5 @entity2 on government funding and debt away from @entity23			1
@entity24 does n't mention @entity23 @entity2 responds to critics that enabled @entity5 @entity2 to propose an approach on friday on the fiscal impasse that still has n't met president @entity6 's chief requirements , but has n't scotched negotiations , either			1
@entity6 , @entity31 agree all sides should keep talking the @entity33 chugged into the @entity5 on thursday with other @entity5 @entity2 leaders where he again waited for his opportunity to make an impact			1
in that meeting , progress seemed elusive as the two sides talked past each other			2
then , the 2012 @entity2 vice presidential candidate stepped in			2
and the tone of the meeting changed			2
key moment in @entity5 meeting @entity2 conceded his side would n't get all it wanted while @entity6 asked how he could make something happen			1
@entity49 : goodbye to the strategy @entity2 knew was a fantasy republicans left the executive mansion expressing optimism , motivated to get to work			2
but can @entity2 push a deal over the finish line ? he might be the person in the @entity2 to do it			2
@entity2 leaves drama to others in new book , @entity2 asks ' where do we go from here ? ' the @entity2 's chief negotiator , house speaker @entity31 , has been unable -- or unwilling -- to reach a deal with the president amid the shutdown			1
@entity31 and @entity6 have a fractured history of bitter negotiations			1
both said afterward they felt burned by the other			0
though they did talk by phone on friday and agreed talks should go on			0
@entity2 and @entity6 , on the other hand , have a completely different relationship			1
they were the fiercest of competitors during the presidential election			0
even after , they remain political foes			0
" now that the president is implementing his agenda , we 'll see that the benefits are far less than advertised , " @entity2 said at the @entity82 in january , just days after @entity6 was inaugurated for the second time			1
while they spent months criticizing and deriding each other on the campaign trail , the mantra of politics is not personal seems to be true with these two			0
after thursday 's meeting , @entity92 rep. @entity92 of @entity93 said they obviously respect each other			2
" @entity2 and the president certainly have a pass through the last election and i think there 's a great respect between them			1
and you ca n't make that up			0
" @entity92 said , adding that " the communication between @entity2 and the president , i think , was an important part of the conversation			1
" what 's more , a @entity5 official told @entity1 that the president viewed @entity2 's op - ed as an opening and provided an opportunity for negotiations to open the government and lift the ceiling to take place			1
@entity2 is steeped in fiscal matters as chairman of the @entity120			0
the two politicians are only nine years apart , and while their positions on government spending are the role of government sit on opposite ends of the political spectrum , the have a bit in common			0
they both tap into the younger generation yet have an academic approach to their work			0
but most importantly , they seem to get along			0
@entity1 's @entity49 put it this way : @entity2 and president @entity6 have a " preexisting condition			1
" they have a prior relationship built on ideological differences not personal insult			0
" they respect each other , " @entity49 said			0
the last time they worked together was six months ago			0
during the last budget battle in march , @entity6 invited @entity2 and his @entity146 counterpart on the @entity120 , rep. @entity145 , @entity147 , to lunch			1
it was the first time @entity6 and @entity2 had sat down together since the presidential race			1
@entity145 said at the time that " their relationship is developing			0
" one of their first public encounters , however , was mixed			0
when @entity6 invited himself to a @entity2 retreat in @entity156 in 2010 , he took questions from the members while the television cameras rolled			1
@entity2 introduced himself as " a ranking member of the @entity120 , " indicating he was n't sure the president knew who he was			2
after a back and forth about the budget , the president abruptly cut @entity2 off , ending the discussion			2
@entity6 later complimented @entity2 , saying , " i think @entity2 is a pretty sincere guy and has a beautiful family			1
" and by the way , in case he 's going to get a @entity2 challenge , i did n't mean it			2
do n't want to hurt you , man			0
" fast forward to today			0
while they have been on different sides of nearly every debate , their relationship is not broken			0
and in today 's @entity0 , that 's saying a lot			2
shutdown polls : no winners , but a bigger loser @entity184 : ' if i was in the @entity186 right now , i 'd kill myself ' @entity187 : our spending addiction is out of control supporters stand by representatives , and government shutdown @entity1 's @entity194 contributed to this report .			0

after keeping a low - *profile* , @entity2 *emerges* with key role in @entity0 's standoff
president @entity6 and @entity2 are political rivals but not enemies
he changed the tenor of a meeting at the @entity5 and engaged @entity6
@entity6 and @entity2 have past relationship that could benefit the negotiations
