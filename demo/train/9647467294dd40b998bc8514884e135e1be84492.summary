-- @entity1 and @entity2 have had sharply contrasting fortunes this season , but both managers celebrated vital victories in the @entity7 on saturday			1
@entity1 's @entity8 moved five points clear at the top of the table with a 3 - 0 victory over struggling @entity13 , putting the pressure on second - placed champions @entity15 to match that result at @entity17 on sunday			1
villas - @entity2 ' short reign at @entity19 has come under increasing scrutiny after the worst run of results since billionaire @entity23 bought the club in 2004 , but a similar three - goal win at another relegation - threatened team , @entity27 , moved his side back into the top four			1
@entity8 suffered a relative lull in form in january with key players injured , suspended and away on international duty , but this month has brought three league wins and a two - leg double over @entity36 champions @entity35 of @entity37 to reach the last 16 of the continent 's second - tier competition			1
@entity41 , back from a four - match domestic ban , opened the scoring at home to @entity13 after half an hour with a delightful near - post finish from fullback @entity46 's left - wing cross			2
the eccentric @entity48 striker celebrated his 10th league goal this season by displaying his latest undershirt -- his previous one asked " why always me ? " but this one spoke of his love for girlfriend @entity55			0
strike partner @entity56 doubled the lead seven minutes after halftime with his 16th league score , pouncing after @entity13 keeper @entity60 failed to deal with a corner from @entity62 , who was also involved in the first goal			2
with @entity65 coming off the bench to head home his 13th in the @entity7 from @entity46 's 80th - minute cross , it means @entity68 may have to wait to make a meaningful contribution to @entity8 's bid for a first league title since 1968			1
the former @entity8 captain ended his three - month exile last week and apologized for his absence without leave , but is lacking match fitness			2
@entity19 's form this month has left @entity2 having to deal with a reported player revolt and constant questions about his future			2
however , the @entity82 bounced back from the @entity84 defeat at @entity85 on tuesday to earn a first victory in six games in all competitions			0
center - back @entity89 struggled again in his usual defensive duties in @entity92 , but showed his undoubted attacking flair as he opened the scoring against @entity27 just after halftime with a curling effort			0
striker @entity97 doubled the lead after the hour and midfielder @entity99 celebrated his return to the starting line - up with the third with 11 minutes left			0
@entity99 , whose @entity103 omission along with other key players prompted @entity23 to interrogate @entity2 about his tactics , made the veteran @entity108 international the first player to reach double figures in the @entity7 nine seasons in a row			0
it was also his 150th in the @entity7			0
the win put @entity19 above @entity114 into the fourth @entity84 qualification place , putting even more pressure on the struggling @entity117 ahead of sunday 's north @entity119 derby at home to third - placed @entity121			1
" the most important thing about this weekend is going to be @entity114 - @entity121 tomorrow and to see in which way you benefit from it , " @entity2 said			0
" you can either benefit from it with @entity121 coming closer to us or we finish in fifth again and ' drama ' all week ! " @entity130 could have moved above @entity114 but blew a two - goal lead against lowly @entity132 , who earned a vital point in caretaker manager @entity136 's first match in charge			1
@entity136 has replaced the sacked @entity138 until the end of this season , becoming the only black manager in charge of an @entity7 side this season			0
new signing @entity145 scored his second goal for @entity130 and @entity148 made it 2 - 0 inside 20 minutes			1
but winger @entity149 pulled one back five minutes after the break and striker @entity151 's 66th - minute leveler moved @entity132 a point above the relegation zone			0
@entity130 joined @entity114 on 43 points -- 20 behind @entity8			1
@entity156 moved up to 12th after thrashing ninth - placed @entity157 4 - 0 , while @entity158 stayed bottom after a 0 - 0 draw at home to @entity162 -- whose striker @entity163 will miss @entity108 's friendly against the @entity165 next week after injuring his ankle			1
@entity167 were above the bottom three on goal difference only following the 1 - 0 defeat by west @entity119 rivals @entity170 , who moved up to 11th after january arrival @entity172 scored his second goal for the club			2
@entity167 debutant @entity176 was then marched for his second yellow card , becoming the team 's third first - half sending - off in four home matches .			0

@entity8 extend @entity7 lead to five points on saturday
@entity8 's 3 - 0 win over @entity13 puts pressure on @entity15 to beat @entity17 on sunday
@entity19 return to the top four with 3 - 0 win over @entity27 that ends poor run of results
*newcastle* join fifth - placed @entity114 on 43 points after being held 2 - 2 by @entity195
