that 's when internet users start ditching online videos if they 're not loading properly , according to a new study from the @entity4 and @entity5			1
by the 10 - second mark , if the video still has n't loaded , about 40 % of @entity7 users will have abandoned it , according to data presented in the study			1
on average , for every second that the video does n't start playing after the two - second mark , there 's a 5.8 % increase in the rate at which the video viewers bail			1
the findings vary depending on the video			2
" viewers are less tolerant to startup delay for a short video such as a news clip than a long video such an hour - long tv episode , " the authors say			1
but , in general , the findings seem to confirm a truism in the twitchy world of the @entity30 : online users do n't like to wait			1
" the study ... contains no startling surprises -- most of us probably suspected that people give up on watching videos that do n't load , " @entity32 writes on the site @entity34			1
" but it does provide useful empirical evidence for companies who must decide how to invest architecture to support their video platforms			2
" some technology bloggers were surprised people did n't click away from glitchy videos faster			2
and previous reports , including one from the @entity50 , suggest web users are even more impatient when it comes to text - based web pages			0
the @entity50 in february cited @entity54 , from @entity55 , as saying that people will go to a website less frequently if it loads 250 milliseconds slower than a competitor 's			0
as this graphic highlights , that 's faster than the blink of an eye			0
" every millisecond matters , " a @entity65 engineer told the paper			0
the @entity4 - @entity4 paper was based on data collected from 6.7 million unique video viewers over a 10 - day period , according to the report			1
the test subjects played a total of 23 million video views			1
the study finds video quality has a potentially longtime impact on a website 's popularity			2
a " viewer who experienced failure " is about 2 % less likely to come back to that same site that week , compared to a person whose videos loaded smoothly			0
finally , the video - loading game seems to be one of expectations			0
people who are trying to watch videos on a mobile phone are likely to be a bit more patient than those on desktop computers with high - speed connections			0
it 's easy to see how that would be the case			0
think back to the hee - hawing days of dial - up internet and remember how long you used to wait for a single photo to load on a super-slow internet connection			0
in part because of this , @entity102 writes for @entity105 that efforts to make online video load faster and faster may amount to an " unwinnable battle			1
" " there may very well be a point when we 'll no longer notice , " he writes , " but for now , it seems that you can never have enough speed			0
" hate online wait times ? have thoughts on the report ? take two seconds and let us know what you think of all this in the comments section .			2
