@entity0 -- three co-authors of the @entity4 report into the 2008 - 09 @entity6 war parted ways with a dramatic reconsideration of key conclusions by @entity10 , the team 's chairman and fourth author			1
@entity14 human rights lawyer @entity13 ; @entity15 , professor of international law at the @entity18 ; and @entity19 , a retired @entity20 soldier and peacekeeper , said in a @entity23 newspaper column in @entity24 on thursday that they want " to dispel any impression that subsequent developments have rendered any part of the mission 's report unsubstantiated , erroneous or inaccurate			0
" " there is no justification for any demand or expectation for reconsideration of the report as nothing of substance has appeared that would in any way change the context , findings or conclusions of that report with respect to any of the parties to the @entity6 conflict , " they said in the @entity24 daily			0
" the report of the fact - finding mission contains the conclusions made after diligent , independent and objective consideration of the information related to the events within our mandate , and careful assessment of its reliability and credibility			2
we firmly stand by these conclusions			2
" the report , issued in september 2009 , is officially called the " @entity65 , " but it is popularly named the " @entity65 " after the former @entity67 jurist			0
the report found both @entity69 and @entity70 likely committed war crimes and possible crimes against humanity during the conflict between december 27 , 2008 , and january 18 , 2009			1
@entity69 launched the offensive against @entity6 militants in response to ongoing firing of rockets against southern @entity69 towns			0
however , in a @entity82 op - ed column posted on the newspaper 's website , @entity10 said he would have reached different conclusions if the @entity69 military had been more forthcoming and if he had known the results of subsequent investigations			1
" if i had known then what i know now , the @entity65 would have been a different document , " wrote @entity10			1
@entity10 wrote that @entity69 investigations found cases involving individual soldiers , but the intentional targeting of civilians was not a " matter of policy			1
" the @entity98 , which assigned @entity10 and others to the fact - finding mission , approved the controversial report , which focused more on alleged war crimes by @entity69			1
@entity69 later provided the @entity65 with a report justifying its actions			1
@entity69 said it faced " asymmetric conflicts " and blamed " militants operating from within and behind civilian areas " for placing civilians at risk			0
in his column , @entity10 cites a subsequent report by a @entity4 committee of independent experts , which found @entity69 investigated more than 400 allegations of misconduct while @entity70 has " not conducted any investigations into the launching of rocket and mortar attacks against @entity69			1
" " that the crimes allegedly committed by @entity70 were intentional goes without saying -- its rockets were purposefully and indiscriminately aimed at civilian targets , " @entity10 wrote			1
@entity10 said @entity69 should have conducted proceedings in a public forum and been more cooperative during his panel 's investigation			2
" @entity69 's lack of cooperation with our investigation meant that we were not able to corroborate how many @entity133 killed were civilians and how many were combatants , " @entity10 wrote in the @entity82 article			1
but the three co-authors in the @entity23 assert @entity69 and @entity70 " have yet to establish a convincing basis for any claims that contradict the findings of the mission 's report			1
" they argue that the follow - up @entity4 report , written by a committee led by judge @entity144 criticized @entity69 , expressing " serious concerns about the late start and slow pace of the proceedings , their insufficient transparency and the participation of victims and witnesses			0
" " in addition , with regard to the issue of the policies guiding @entity157 , the committee states that there is ' no indication that @entity69 has opened investigations into the actions of those who designed , planned , ordered and oversaw @entity157			2
' in other words , one of the most serious allegations about the conduct of @entity69 's military operations remains completely unaddressed , " the three wrote , referring to the name of the @entity69 offensive			0
echoing a report by the follow - up committee , the three say they regret that " no domestic investigations at all have been started into any of the allegations of international crimes committed by members of @entity181 armed groups in @entity6 which have fired thousands of rockets into southern @entity69			2
" the @entity69 government and others have called for the @entity65 to retract the @entity186 report , but the three reject those stances as well as what they say have been " personal attacks and the extraordinary pressure " on the members of the fact - finding mission			1
" had we given in to pressures from any quarter to sanitize our conclusions , we would be doing a serious injustice to the hundreds of innocent civilians killed during the @entity6 conflict , the thousands injured , and the hundreds of thousands whose lives continue to be deeply affected by the conflict and the blockade , " the three said			0
@entity205 , @entity69 's @entity207 spokesman , on thursday reiterated @entity69 's negative position on the @entity186 report , citing flaws and biases in the document			0
he defended @entity69 investigations into the report and endorsements by international authorities that the country sincerely worked to seek justice			2
a @entity219 government spokesman welcomed the column and said it is " very disturbing that members of the committee say they have been put under pressure to sanitize their conclusions			0
" " @entity69 must not be allowed to influence the outcome of what needs to be an objective process			0
nor must @entity69 be allowed to investigate its own actions and find itself not guilty , " @entity229 said			0
@entity1 's @entity231 and @entity232 contributed to this report			0

three @entity65 co-authors stand by mission
@entity10 recently *questioned* the conclusions
both sides criticize @entity69 , @entity70 for lack of investigations
