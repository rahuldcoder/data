-- as pretty on the eyes as they are dramatic on the ears			0
that 's how we should appreciate some of the world 's concert halls , according to building data company @entity8			1
the @entity10 - based company has put together a list of what it 's calling the world 's most spectacular concert halls			1
" these days concert halls also have remarkable architecture , offering audiences a great show even before they have taken their seats , " the report said			1
" more and more concert halls are being built that stand out by virtue of their eye - catching shapes , colors and materials			2
" it highlights the @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , as an example of an " extraordinary " concert structure : " the white building 's curved , wave - like shape makes it seem as if it has been ' poured ' into the landscape			0
" @entity40 's @entity39 building , completed in 1963 , also makes the list , as do the @entity42 in @entity43 and @entity45 's @entity44			0
the @entity47 and @entity48 both get two entries -- @entity57 ' @entity56 " has the appearance of curved metal plates piled into one other and which ... make the design look like an outlandish fantasy , " the report said			1
one surprising omission from the list of 15 is @entity61 's famous @entity60			0
but it does get a mention in the report , illustrating how long some of these structures take to build			0
the @entity60 took 14 years to complete , and one concert hall in construction , @entity10 's @entity68 building , will be completed in 2016 , nine years after having started			2
