-- @entity2 royal watchers are in a tizzy over comments reportedly made by @entity5 comparing @entity7 president @entity6 to @entity8			1
according to the @entity11 newspaper , a woman claims @entity5 made the offhand comment during a tour monday of the @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16			1
he was talking with a 78 - year @entity19 woman who escaped the @entity20 by sailing to @entity21 in 1939 -- just before @entity22 seized the city of @entity24 , the newspaper said			1
" i had finished showing him the exhibit and talked with him about my own family background and how i came to @entity21 , " the newspaper quoted @entity26 as saying			1
" the prince then said , ' and now @entity6 is doing just about the same as @entity8 , ' " the newspaper quoted her as saying , referring to @entity7 's disputed annexation of @entity34			1
@entity26 said she agreed with @entity5			2
" i must say that i agree with him and am sure a lot of people do , " @entity26 said			0
" i was very surprised that he made the comment as i know they are n't meant to say these things but it was very heartfelt and honest			0
" @entity0 could not independently confirm the conversation early wednesday			0
representatives for prince @entity5 declined to comment			1
" however , we would like to stress that the @entity5 would not seek to make a public political statement during a private conversation , " @entity45 said in a statement			2
in the @entity2 system , the queen is head of state , but foreign policy is set by the elected government			2
as heir to the throne , it would be considered unusual for @entity5 to make such a statement			2
so far , there 's been no response from @entity7			0
@entity2 's @entity60 newspaper reported a @entity6 spokesman declined to comment when approached by reporters			1
on @entity64 , @entity2 member of parliament @entity63 criticized @entity5			1
" in constitutional monarchy policy and diplomacy should be conducted by parliament and government , " he wrote			0
" @entity69 should be seen and not heard			0
" deputy prime minister @entity70 , however , defended @entity5 to the @entity71 -- saying the conversation was clearly private			0
" i have never been of this view that if you are a member of the royal family somehow you have to enter into some @entity77 vow of silence , " the @entity71 quoted him as saying			0
some view such comparisons as inflammatory given the tense state of relations in @entity84 over @entity7 's actions in @entity86			0
former @entity88 secretary of state @entity87 garnered some criticism in march when she made a similar comparison			0
for others , such comparisons may dredge up the painful history of @entity84 's unsuccessful efforts to contain @entity8 in the 1930s			1
in 1938 , @entity8 annexed @entity96 over meek @entity84 objections , then supervised @entity22 's takover of the @entity99 under the pretext of protecting the @entity103 region 's large ethnic @entity22 population			1
similar issues were raised before @entity22 's 1939 invasion of @entity19			0
the failures of @entity84 governments to stop the @entity22 advances under what was then known as the policy of " appeasement " have been endlessly debated by historians considering the impact of @entity8 's early moves on the bloody and brutal years that followed			2
