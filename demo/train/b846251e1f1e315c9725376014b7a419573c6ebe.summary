-- military spouse @entity1 has lived through five moves with her husband and their two young children			0
currently living at @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , she has made each new town " home " for her family while her husband has served overseas during 13 deployments			0
the moving boxes , the unfamiliar surroundings , the new schools , teachers and friends -- all are the norm for @entity1 , her family , and thousands of military families across the nation			1
and so are the challenges facing military spouses like @entity1 , who also pursue their own careers			1
in honor of @entity27 and the homage we pay to our veterans this week , we would like to offer tribute to @entity32 's service members , their families and the myriad sacrifices they make for this country			2
the challenges they face are tremendous , which is why we are advancing solutions in the @entity38 to make life better for service members and their families			2
five years ago , as friends and colleagues , we reached across the aisle and joined to form the bipartisan @entity44			0
its mission is to advocate for military families like @entity1 's and draw attention to the challenges they face every day			1
over the years , the caucus , which has over 40 members , has reached out to the entire @entity52 to address such issues as education , health care , combating stress from multiple deployments , mental health , and military spouse employment			1
we also educate military families on available resources and promote related legislation before the @entity38			1
our caucus membership hails from coast to coast , and crosses political boundaries as well			0
additionally , a corresponding @entity44 has been formed in the @entity66			0
together , we work with first lady @entity67 and dr. @entity69 's " joining forces " project , as well as interface with numerous service organizations like the @entity73 , @entity74 , the @entity75 , the @entity76 , and the @entity77 to successfully support military families			1
both of us have personal experiences with military families			1
one of us married the daughter of a 20 - year career @entity85 veteran , and one of us married a retired 26 - year career @entity89 officer			0
both our families have a deep understanding and connection to the struggles facing spouses and children coping with continual deployments and rotations			2
through living these experiences and hearing their stories , we have garnered a deep appreciation for the tremendous responsibilities that military families like @entity1 's take on every single day			1
@entity1 knew that life as a military spouse would bring its own unique set of challenges			0
she did not realize , however , that finding a specialized job in her profession would be nearly impossible as her family moved across the country			0
trained as an engineer , @entity1 needed state - specific licensing in order to qualify for many positions -- meaning each time she moved , she needed to meet each state 's experience standards			1
eventually @entity1 made the difficult decision to change career paths to provide for her family , and now works as a career consultant and draws attention to how difficult it can be for military spouses to find employment			1
@entity1 's challenge is not unique to her			0
half of working military spouses need licensing or certification for their employment			1
since almost 80 % of military families have moved across state lines at least once in the past five years , it 's no wonder military spouses have some of the highest unemployment rates in the country			1
in @entity38 , we are working to better understand the trials military spouses like @entity1 face			2
we recently offered an amendment to evaluate the @entity143 's progress in helping military spouses find jobs , which passed through the @entity52 this may			1
it is vital to better understand how the program is being used , who is using it and whether the jobs obtained match applicants ' skill sets , education and experience , to address unemployment and underemployment for our military spouses			2
in a political environment often stuck in gridlock , it is not often that you hear of @entity161 and @entity162 working together -- yet every year we host a @entity163 where we hear directly from military families in order to better understand their challenges			2
we also connect them with local employers , health care providers , support leaders and advocates			0
we listen , and we learn			0
we bring their voices back to @entity7 and share their stories with our colleagues			0
these families have given so much and have gone through more than most of us can imagine , and so this @entity27 -- and every month -- we will be doing all that we can to stand behind them and honor their sacrifices , so they may in turn continue to keep @entity32 strong			0
join us on @entity180 / @entity179 .			0

@entity52 members put aside partisanship in support of military families
authors : military spouses struggle with maintaining careers as families move
they say state - specific licensing rules can make it *extremely* difficult for spouses ' careers
we owe military families as much support as we can give them , authors say
