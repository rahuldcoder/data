@entity0 , @entity1 -- they arrived in the @entity4 from @entity5 , young girls held against their will and forced to work for hours on end			1
but this time , it did n't happen hundreds of years ago			2
@entity10 's journey started in 2002 , when she was barely 12 , in her small village in western @entity12			1
she and about 20 other girls were held in plain sight , but always under the watchful eyes of their captors			2
" it was like being trapped , like being in a cage , " said " @entity10 , " now 19			1
@entity2 agreed not to use her real name			1
" i always have to behave , behave , behave , behave			2
" the girls ' families sent them to the @entity4 after being assured they would receive a better education			1
but once they arrived , they were forced to work in hair braiding shops across the @entity0 area -- just a short drive from @entity28 , right in the shadow of the @entity30			1
the girls , who are now young women , have never spoken publicly before , until now			2
" it was horrible , " said @entity32 , who was 15 when she was brought over from @entity33			1
" sometimes there was not enough food for us to eat			2
... it was like a prison			2
i was just stuck there			2
" for the first time , the former slaves provided details about their horrifying odyssey and an intimate view into the world of human trafficking and contemporary slavery			1
" @entity56 " was 13 when her family sent her to the @entity4 , not knowing that a woman she called " auntie " was a human trafficker			1
it was unclear if the woman was a blood relative			2
" my dad ... worked hard so i could go to school , so when my auntie came and told my family that i could go to a school in the @entity4 ... they trusted her , " she said			1
" everyone was happy about it			2
" the girls worked in the salons right out in the open , in front of customers			2
they were on their feet all day , sometimes for more than 12 hours , weaving intricate and elaborate hair braids , seven days a week			2
this went on for more than five years			2
" we stood there all day , just braiding , " @entity56 said			2
" if they want really small braids , you stay there sometimes until 2 a.m. ... that 's every day			2
" at times , they were forced to braid the hair of @entity4 teenagers no older than they were -- girls who were free and had no idea the people braiding their hair were slaves			1
" i wished i could go with them , " @entity10 said			1
" most of the time , i 'd end up just breaking down later crying ... because when i see teenagers going around , going to the movies and just being a teen ... i just could n't understand why my life has to be this way ... " in one of the many ironies in the case , the customers whose hair was braided by the slave girls were mostly @entity103 - @entity4 women , many of whom could have been descendants of slaves brought to @entity4 generations ago			1
slavery through trafficking continues widely today in the @entity4 , though often undetected , according to law enforcement officials			1
@entity10 , @entity32 , @entity56 and the other girls were held in groups in several houses around @entity0 and @entity114 , @entity1			1
the girls were brought to the @entity4 at different times between 2002 and 2007 , according to court documents			1
as the group grew , the traffickers ran out of places to put them and had to rent more living quarters			0
the homes were always in the middle of residential areas with manicured lawns and nice houses , often near churches , schools and community buildings			0
" i think it 's hard for people to believe that in 2010 , we have people who actually put people in slavery , " said @entity130 , the @entity4 attorney for @entity1 , whose office successfully prosecuted the case			1
" it 's the most fundamental and intolerable violation of human rights			0
" the traffickers convicted in this case were a mother , father and son who also came from @entity5 , according to court documents and law enforcement officials			1
@entity10 , @entity32 and @entity56 described living in fear shortly after they arrived in the @entity4 , forced to work by day at the hair salons and sleeping in groups on the floor at night			1
" when i got here ... i asked her if i was going to school , and she said there was no school , " @entity56 said , referring to her auntie , the trafficking ringleader			0
" i said , ' i 'm not going to school ? ' [ and ] she said , ' no ' ... and that was her decision and she was n't going to change it			0
" the captors controlled the girls by beating them , withholding food , keeping them separated from anyone else and , at times , through sexual abuse , according to court documents			0
the young women who spoke to @entity2 described years of cruelty , physical abuse , beatings with wood or metal objects , extreme isolation and sleeping on mattresses on floors in filthy conditions			1
even their phone calls back to their families were monitored by their captors			0
" i always thought of running [ away ] , but i know nobody , " @entity32 said			1
" i do n't know where to go , did n't have [ any ] friends , nobody to talk to , so it was kind of hard			0
... i had nowhere to go to			0
" five years after the girls began arriving , @entity185 agents received a tip and began extensive surveillance on the houses where the girls were kept			0
after months of surveillance , the @entity185 agents raided the houses in 2007			0
inside , they found the girls and mattresses on the floor			0
the traffickers had hidden bags of cash and the girls ' passports			0
@entity201 , who led the team of agents , said none of the girls ' customers ever called officials to help			0
" hundreds of people came into these salons , they probably witnessed things out of the ordinary , " said @entity208 , special agent in charge of @entity185 's @entity211 in @entity0			2
" these girls were shielded from the outside world , virtually hidden in plain sight ... from everything else that was around them			0
" edge and the girls said several customers asked about the girls ' ages , and the girls -- following the orders of their captors -- lied and said they were 18			0
" i wish one of my customers ... would have gone to police , " @entity10 said			1
" i wish they would have helped me			0
" in the 2007 raid , the @entity185 agents found a notebook the girls used to track the tips they received , but could n't keep , at the hair salon			2
ironically , on the cover of the notebook was a picture of the @entity30			0
more than two years later , @entity239 ; her husband , @entity241 ; and their son , @entity242 , were convicted of running the trafficking ring			0
@entity239 was the ringleader , while her husband and son were accomplices , according to court documents			0
in september of this year , a @entity0 court sentenced @entity239 to 27 years in prison , while her husband received 24 years and their son received 4½ years			0
the girls had to testify against the @entity254 in court			0
all i did was cry			0
it was overwhelming , " @entity10 said			1
" i told myself , ' she finally got what she deserved ' ... she did really , really wrong			0
and she was heartless ... and i 'm happy she was caught			0
" court records show the @entity254 knew many of the families whose girls they lured away to become their slaves			2
they had an elaborate scheme to lure the girls : mrs. @entity241 would approach families of young girls in @entity12 and @entity33 , where she had connections , and tell the families she would give the girls an education in the @entity4			1
they then used fraudulent visa papers to sneak the girls into the country			0
experts say the main reason for most modern - day human trafficking is money			0
" human trafficking is extremely profitable , " said @entity282 , a law professor and a national expert on human trafficking			0
the customers at the hair braiding salon where @entity32 and @entity10 were forced to work would sometimes pay as much as $ 200 to $ 400 for elaborate braiding that would take many hours to complete			1
the traffickers took every penny made by the girls , both in tips and payments for their hair braiding			1
they made about $ 4 million , according to court documents			0
" it 's so profitable that we are seeing some drug traffickers get out of drug trafficking and into human trafficking , " said @entity282 , who teaches law at the @entity298 in @entity299			0
@entity282 heads a clinic that is helping @entity10 and many of the other girls move ahead with their lives			1
" sadly , the work of our clinic is necessary in every community in @entity4 , " she said			1
" human trafficking , also known as modern - day slavery , exists in big cities , in small towns , in rural areas with no towns , exists in restaurants , in hair salons , in hotels and in farmwork			1
" almost every industry you can think of , there is an opportunity there for someone to be exploited			0
this is everywhere in the @entity4 " today , @entity10 , @entity32 , @entity56 and the other girls are trying to move on with their lives			1
several are in high school , and one has recently been accepted into college			0
most of the girls have not been able to return home to see their families in @entity5			1
when asked why she agreed to finally talk out about such a painful chapter of her life , @entity10 said she wanted to raise awareness about what other young girls may be going through			1
" i want to tell people that slavery exists , " she said			0
" it 's huge , and it 's really happening here			0
