-- one backward notion that has been used to differentiate the 1960s @entity3 from today 's struggle for @entity6 equality in the @entity7 is the idea that gay people are somehow " invisible " and can hide who they are			1
this , in theory , makes them immune to discrimination			0
" how do you know who to discriminate against ... ? " @entity18 rep. @entity17 asked in an interview that was rebroadcast this week by @entity21 's @entity20			0
i wish that , too , was satire , but @entity17 went on in the march 3 interview with a tv station in @entity26 to explain that characteristics that are n't " specifically protected in the @entity28 " must be " immutable , " meaning " a characteristic that can be independently verified and ca n't be willfully changed			0
" the insinuation there is that a person 's gayness must be verified for that person to be protected from discrimination			0
( keep in mind that a person 's religious freedom is protected by the @entity28 , and religious beliefs are not always permanent and identifiable visually )			0
or that , because @entity6 people ca n't be readily branded as gay , they do n't deserve special protections under the law			1
logical conclusion : gay - labeling laws ! @entity20 , bless him , went on to instruct his viewers to mail photos of themselves proving their gayness to @entity17 's office address , which is 2210 @entity51 , @entity52 20515			1
( do n't send anything pornographic , but i think that stunt is pretty hilarious )			0
all of this comes up in reference to the so - called " gay @entity61 " bills that are popping in up in several states , most recently in @entity60			1
these bills vary , but the undercurrent is that some religious groups want protection so that they could , in some instances , deny services to @entity6 people based on their religious beliefs			2
that 's outrageous , obviously , as even @entity72 's hyperconservative governor , @entity71 , realized when she vetoed one such bill in her state late last month			2
@entity60 's bill already has been toned down some , but activists say the current version is still discriminatory			1
i 'm not that interested in the politics of these laws			0
what 's more important are the sentiments -- fear and ignorance , it seems to me -- that drive this legislation			1
these sentiments may seem isolated , but they 're not			0
the reality is that gay people , especially in sometimes - hostile states like @entity60 , which i visited last year to report on lgbt rights , spend a lot of their time trying to cover up who they are because they fear discrimination			1
and they fear discrimination not because they 're litigious but because they see discrimination all around them , all the time , even in 2014 @entity7			2
it shows up in comments like those from @entity17 , in comments from friends and family , and , most crucially , in @entity7 's broken legal protections for @entity6 people			2
how could a person expect to live free of discrimination in a country where a majority of states do n't protect gay people from being fired or evicted because of who they are ? those issues are n't the subject of soundbites this week , but they 're equally important			1
@entity7 is quick , and right , to judge the actions of countries such as @entity120 and @entity121 , with deplorable records of persecuting @entity6 people			2
@entity120 last month passed a law intensifying criminal penalties for homosexual acts			2
but our judgment , as long as we continue to support discriminatory policies back home , stinks of hypocrisy			0
that @entity17 would argue in 2014 that being gay is a " self - professed behavior , " and therefore one not worthy of explicit protection , is deeply troubling , but i 'm comforted to know antiquated views such as that are moving toward the fringe of the discourse			2
that 's true even in @entity60 , where one of these " religious freedom " bills is currently being debated and where activists have been staging demonstrations			1
gay people -- verified or not -- have increasingly stepped out into the public spotlight in @entity60 to tell their stories			1
that 's what i found when i visited the state last year			0
i met a prison guard who sued his employer after he was fired , he said , because he 's gay			0
i met lesbian couples in @entity153 who marched into a courthouse and demanded marriage licenses even though they would be denied under the law			0
and i met brave openly gay people who live proudly in the most remote of places			1
by sharing their stories , i 'm optimistic they 'll eventually get through to people like @entity17 who , for now at least , seems to need some proof of their existence			0
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			1

@entity60 is the latest state to consider a " gay @entity61 " law
@entity167 : ignorance and fear *promote* that sort of legislation
he says *proponents* would rather think of gay people as invisible
