@entity0 -- an online campaign in support of a former @entity4 -- arrested for attempting to security - check his pistol while visiting the @entity8 -- is bringing new attention and a fair amount of scrutiny to one of the nation 's toughest gun - control laws			1
@entity15 , 28 , was charged with criminal possession of his .45 - caliber @entity17 while visiting the famous @entity0 landmark during a september vacation with his girlfriend			1
@entity15 has a license to carry the weapon from his home state of @entity24 , but @entity26 state gun laws do not recognize out - of - state permits			1
with his case still pending , @entity15 could face up to three and a half years in jail			2
@entity15 's attorney says its clear his client , who does not have a criminal record , was n't attempting anything nefarious because @entity15 approached security on his own to tell the guards about his weapon			1
but the law prohibits anyone -- with certain exceptions such as law enforcement officers -- from carrying a firearm in the state unless that person specifically has a @entity43 - issued permit			1
@entity15 spent two days in a jail cell before he could make bail			2
" i was in utter disbelief , i was in shock , " said @entity15			0
his arrest is one amid a series of similar instances that have some questioning whether @entity43 's strict gun laws , which aim to protect public safety , are unnecessarily targeting law - abiding citizens			0
" we just do n't believe , as i believe most do n't think , that he should be prosecuted under such a stringent statute which is clearly designed to get the so - called bad guys , " said @entity15 's attorney , @entity58			2
fellow @entity4 , on a website called @entity4 are rallying to @entity15 's side and have begun a letter - writing campaign			1
@entity66 says he 's been sending the letters to @entity0 law enforcement officials			0
" we 're asking that @entity15 's case be moved from the prosecution file to dismissed file -- it 's as simple as that , " @entity66 said			0
@entity15 attempted to check @entity0 's gun laws on his cell phone , but his lawyer says @entity15 " made a mistake , " when he read the information			1
" its just been a real nightmare , " @entity15 told @entity1			0
other gun - toting tourists have also found themselves in similar situations @entity84 activist @entity83 , who according to the @entity85 legally checked his unloaded @entity87 - registered pistol in a locked box during a preflight check - in at @entity0 's @entity90 , was arrested at the airport in december			1
authorities say in @entity83 's case , the original charge was reduced to a violation and a fine			0
last month , a @entity98 medical student was arrested at the @entity99 after trying to check her gun ; she will go to court in march			2
the head of a prominent @entity0 gun - control group sympathizes with @entity15 , but says the gun laws should not change			1
" @entity0 needs to send a very powerful message to gun owners , which is if you decide to have a gun , there 's a lot of responsibility that comes with that , " the president of the @entity114 of @entity0 , @entity115 , told @entity1 , " and one of those responsibilities is knowing where and when you can carry that gun			2
" as for @entity15 , his fate is in the hands of the @entity123 district attorney			0
its unclear what prosecutors will do with this case " all of our laws allow prosecutors to carefully evaluate the facts and circumstances unique to each case , and exercise discretion in cases where justice dictates leniency , " said @entity127 , director of communications for the district attorney 's office			0
she added , " @entity43 has enacted rational gun laws for one very simple reason : to protect everyone visiting , living , or working in @entity0			1
" @entity15 is expected to be back in court in march			0
@entity1 's @entity144 contributed to this report .			0
