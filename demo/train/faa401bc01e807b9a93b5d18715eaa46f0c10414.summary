-- seventy years ago this week , president @entity1 signed the @entity2 , formally the @entity2 , which the @entity3 and @entity4 passed unanimously			1
it authorized unemployment compensation for a maximum of 52 weeks and guaranteed farm , home and business loans up to $ 2,000 to @entity11 veterans			0
most importantly , by providing up to four years of education and training at annual tuition rates of up to $ 500 ( the rate then charged by @entity18 ) , plus a monthly living stipend , the bill made it possible for @entity20 to attend any college or university that would accept them			2
in 2014 , the promise of full and equal access to higher education for men and women in the armed services , and , for that matter , for all academically qualified @entity32 , has not been fulfilled			1
family income , not a concerted national initiative , still dictates whether students , including servicemen and women , go to college and which institutions they attend			0
more than 2 million @entity11 veterans went to college on the @entity2			1
at least a quarter of them could not have done this without it			0
many excelled ; gis appeared with regularity on honors rolls and deans lists			0
and they more than paid back the investment that had been made in them			0
many of them achieved higher occupational status , more job security , better health and pension benefits and paid more taxes than their peers			2
they joined 50 % more civic and political organizations and voted more frequently than their contemporaries in post-war @entity32 , according to @entity62 , author of " soldiers to citizens : the @entity2 and the @entity65 " and a professor of government at @entity68			2
they also upended a pervasive assumption at the time that college was best suited to affluent @entity32			2
influenced no doubt by the performance of the first wave of @entity2 students , the 1947 @entity71 , @entity72 in @entity73 , called for " free and universal access to higher education " for all @entity32 based on the interests , needs , and abilities of each student , but without regard to race , creed , sex , national origin or economic circumstances			1
the @entity2 and the @entity89 touched off a golden age of higher education in the @entity32			1
thanks in no small measure to funding for financial aid and research from states and the federal government , the number of undergraduates increased five-fold from 1945 to 1975 , and graduate students nine-fold , according to @entity102 in " @entity103 of @entity72 's @entity104			0
" in the past 70 years , @entity2 benefits have become significantly less generous than the provisions of the @entity2 of 1944			1
the @entity109 of 1952 , the veterans @entity107 of 1966 and the @entity2 of 1985 fell far short of covering tuition and fees at many public and private colleges and universities			0
while 52 % of @entity11 veterans enrolled in private colleges and universities under the @entity2 , only 20 % of the veterans of @entity115 and @entity116 were able to do so			0
it has become more difficult to ask , as @entity121 did in the 1940s , " why go to @entity123 when the government will send you to @entity126 ? " although sen. @entity127 wanted his @entity2 , signed into law by president @entity129 on june 30 , 2008 , to give veterans of the wars in @entity132 and @entity133 " the same educational chance that ' @entity141 ' had , " it provided tuition payments only up to the most expensive in - state public university and restricted eligibility to individuals who spent three years or more on active duty			1
more generally , state appropriations for all higher education in recent years have leveled off or gone down , and federal funding for financial aid for undergraduates has not kept pace with the cost of attendance at public or private institutions			1
the maximum @entity152 grant , which accounted for about four - fifths of the cost at an average public university in the ' 70s , now covers about 31 %			0
little wonder , then , that three of four individuals from families in the top quartile of the economic distribution have received undergraduate degrees by age 24 , but only one of five in the third tier and one of 10 in the fourth -- and the median debt at graduation is rising rapidly			0
or that the @entity32 is no longer at the top -- or even near the top -- of countries that send the highest percentage of their young people to college			2
more than ever , it is clear that educational achievement promotes economic growth , helps our nation compete in world markets and leads to high incomes as well as individual fulfillment			0
so let 's mark the 70th birthday of the @entity2 not just by celebrating one of the greatest pieces of legislation in @entity32 history			1
we must also insist that @entity190 make it a high priority to provide the opportunity for our servicemen and women -- and for all young men and women in the @entity32 -- to use higher education to fulfill the @entity198 and go as far and as fast as their ambition , discipline and talent will take them .			1

@entity205 : 70 years ago , @entity1 signed @entity2 ; more than 2 million went to college on it
after later wars , @entity32 's promise of higher education to vets *diminshed* , he says
he says @entity2 paid off : vets got better jobs , were more civicly engaged , paid more taxes
writer : @entity190 must *reprioritize* this educational pact with vets and all @entity32
