@entity0 -- crews struggling to bring the crippled @entity5 nuclear plant under control had some success sunday as cooling systems at two of the facility 's reactors were working , @entity2 reported			1
earlier , workers had connected electric cables needed to power up cooling systems in the damaged reactors			1
the plan is to get power up and running for the @entity18 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 reactors soon			1
officials with plant owner @entity21 and @entity23 told @entity1 that the company still has to conduct safety and stability checks on the circuit before throwing the switch			2
cooling systems at the @entity18 and 6 reactors -- the least - troublesome of the group -- have already been restored , @entity2 said			1
the cooling systems are essential to keep temperatures low , curb the further emission of radioactive material and , in a worst - case scenario , prevent a full nuclear meltdown			1
a meltdown could occurs when nuclear fuel rods get so hot that they melt the steel and concrete structure containing them , spilling out into the air and water with potentially deadly results			2
but there is no guarantee that the cooling systems will work			1
" we do not know if the water pumps are damaged and if they will still work when power is restored , " said @entity49 , a special assistant to the director of the @entity51			2
meanwhile , authorities set up a new system using an unmanned device that sprayed seawater continuously on the no. 3 reactor 's overheating spent nuclear fuel pool			0
a @entity0 fire department official said the system began operating around 2 p.m. saturday and can spray water for up to seven hours at a time			0
previously , firefighters , soldiers and electric company workers had manually done the same in brief intervals to avoid prolonged radiation exposure			1
the water , pumped from a nearby port and then funneled to the system , was directed at the no. 3 reactor 's spent fuel pool in order to cool it and prevent the emission of more radioactive material into the atmosphere			0
authorities have also started spraying the no. 4 reactor			0
the news comes soon after the @entity83 government considered halting the sale of food from farms near the @entity5 plant after abnormally high levels of radiation were found in milk and spinach			1
very small amounts -- far below the level of concern -- of radioactive iodine were also detected in tap water in @entity0 and most prefectures near the @entity5 plant damaged by last week 's monster earthquake and tsunami			1
chief cabinet secretary @entity101 said levels of radiation exceeding safety limits stipulated by @entity83 law were found in some samples of spinach and milk from the @entity5 and @entity109 prefectures but authorities said the radioactive iodine - contaminated food posed little risk			1
tainted milk was found 30 kilometers ( 18 1/2 miles ) from the plant and spinach was collected as far as 100 kilometers ( 65 miles ) to the south , almost halfway to @entity0			1
" though radioactive iodine has a short half - life of about eight days and decays naturally within a matter of weeks , there is a short - term risk to human health if radioactive iodine in food is absorbed into the human body , " warned the @entity51			0
a person who consumed the tainted food continuously for a year would take in the same amount of radiation as a single ct scan , @entity101 said			2
that 's about 7 millisieverts or double what an average person in an industrialized country is exposed to in a year , according to the @entity133			0
beyond saturday 's food safety announcement , there have been few indications of any immediate fallout from the nuclear crisis			2
airborne radiation levels around @entity83 have shown no signs of spiking drastically , according to measurements posted online saturday by the nation 's education and science ministry			1
most readings showed detectable but relatively small amounts of radiation			0
even the two top readings in @entity150 ( in @entity109 ) and @entity151 ( in @entity148 prefecture ) are well below what 's considered dangerous to humans and had fallen in recent days			0
still , no one has said that authorities are in the clear			0
in fact , authorities acknowledged friday that the situation is far more serious than they 'd originally estimated			0
" we sincerely apologize ... for causing such a great concern and nuisance , " said a statement from @entity160 , the president of @entity21			0
and the company 's managing director , @entity164 , broke down in a tears after leaving a news conference in @entity5 at which exposure levels were discussed			1
six members of the emergency crew at the plant have been exposed to more than 100 millisieverts of radiation per hour , the equivalent of getting 10 chest x-rays per hour , @entity21 said			2
the utility said the workers were exposed when trying to restore electricity to the stricken reactors in hopes of using the cooling systems again			1
@entity21 had raised the exposure level for emergency workers from its previous standard of 100 millisieverts per hour to 250 millisieverts			0
people are naturally exposed to about 3 millisieverts of radiation a year			0
the @entity186 recommends no more than 50 millisieverts exposure in a given year for nuclear rescue and recovery workers			2
it offers no restriction in a crisis when " the benefit to others clearly outweighs the rescuer 's risk			0
" @entity1 's @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 contributed to this report			0

new : report : cooling systems at the @entity18 and 6 reactors are working
workers connected cables needed to power up cooling systems at the stricken reactors
@entity83 may halt the sale of food from areas near the @entity5 nuclear plant
abnormally high levels of radiation were found in milk and spinach
