-- huge crowds assembled in @entity2 on thursday at a national memorial service for the @entity5 leader @entity4 , the second day of state - orchestrated ceremonies to mourn the dictator who died earlier this month			1
the authoritarian regime used a mixture of somber music , hyperbolic speeches , booming artillery fire and blaring horns to honor the man who oversaw 17 years of despotic rule in the secretive nation			1
the ceremony took place a day after a funeral procession for @entity4 spent three hours winding through the snow - laden streets of @entity2 lined with thousands of wailing mourners			1
once again , the regime placed @entity24 , the son and chosen successor of @entity4 , at the center of proceedings , proclaiming him the " supreme leader " of @entity5 -- a fresh indication that the leadership transition is progressing smoothly			1
the footage broadcast thursday by @entity5 state television showed thick rectangular blocks of people gathered in the snowy expanse of @entity36 -- named after @entity4 's father , the founder of @entity5			2
@entity24 and other senior members of the regime stood solemnly on a viewing platform overlooking the square			0
during the ceremony , a string of top officials took to the microphone to praise @entity4 's life and reinforce @entity24 's leadership credentials			1
" @entity24 is the supreme leader who has inherited @entity4 's beliefs , leadership , courage and guts , " said @entity48 , the president of the @entity5 parliament			1
read about the funeral for @entity4 " @entity4 's great achievements will shine forever , " said @entity55 , a senior official in the powerful @entity56			2
" following our party 's supreme leader , @entity24 , we are converting our sadness to courage and we will achieve great things			2
" under @entity4 , the country suffered a devastating famine even as it built up its million - strong army , expanded its arsenal of ballistic missiles and became the world 's eighth declared nuclear power			0
he died on december 17 , reportedly from a heart attack			0
news of his death , announced two days later , put the region on edge and set off speculation around the world about the country 's stability and future direction			2
for the time being , @entity24 appears to be rallying support within the regime , despite his young age -- he is thought to be in his late 20s -- and relative inexperience			0
after the speeches thursday , a row of heavy guns fired off a salute			0
then , a cacophony of horns and sirens went off , drawing the service -- and the last day of official mourning -- to a close			0
