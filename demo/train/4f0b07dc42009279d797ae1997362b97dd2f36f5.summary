sen. @entity0 surprised members of the @entity2 on thursday when he threatened to force a vote on a declaration of war against @entity5 as an amendment to an unrelated bill dealing with clean drinking water around the world			1
the @entity11 @entity10 , frustrated that @entity12 has n't voted to formally okay the military operation already underway against the terrorist group , said he hoped his move would " shame " the @entity12 into action			1
" i think the most important duty of a legislator is to vote yea or nay on whether or not we are sending our young men and women to war , " @entity0 told @entity17			1
" i think we 've been derelict in our duty , @entity12 has abdicated that duty			2
the president , i think , in his arrogance , has assumed that he does n't even need to ask			0
" the unexpected move by @entity0 , a potential 2016 presidential candidate , prompted @entity31 to quickly counter with proposals of their own and launched a spirited debate inside a small , camera-less committee room in the @entity36 about the role @entity12 should play in approving military strikes			1
there were no tv cameras because none of the television outlets that cover @entity12 had planned to cover action on the somewhat obscure water bill			1
during the debate , democrats like @entity46 of @entity47 and @entity48 of @entity49 , argued the senators had a solemn obligation to their constituents to vote on an @entity54 , even if it 's unlikely @entity12 can complete action on it before the congressional session ends in a few days			1
but republicans like @entity58 of @entity59 , who will be the committee chairman next year , argued the debate was being " rushed " and that the administration itself has n't said what it wants or needs in an @entity54			0
he argued that a lot of the " passion " in the room was from @entity31 " wanting to go on record not wanting boots on the ground			0
" sen. @entity71 , @entity72 , complained the proposals had some " very strange things " in them , including restrictions on ground troops			0
he said that would make it very difficult for the @entity78 to defeat @entity5			2
he argued that the reason the administration has not asked for an @entity54 is because " they have no strategy " against @entity5			2
@entity71 said it was " ludicrous " a " nice little water bill " was used as a vehicle for a war authorization that has little chance of passing @entity12			2
" it 's a living , breathing argument against lame duck sessions , ' he said			0
in the end , committee leaders got everyone to agree to push off action until next week , when they promised a more structured and focused debate			1
committee chairman @entity97 said they want secretary of state @entity98 to testify in open session monday about what the administration is looking for in an @entity54			0
that would be followed by a classified session with @entity98 or other administration officials where they could go into greater detail about the military strategy to defeat @entity5			2
finally , on wednesday , the committee would reconvene in open session for a more full debate and votes on @entity54 language and amendments			0
" we will now have the opportunity to engage in meaningful , transparent debate ion the @entity78 military mission against @entity5 , as i 've been calling for since military action began nearly four months ago , " said sen. @entity112 , @entity113 , a leading advocate for @entity12 to vote on an @entity54			1
" we owe it to our service members and the @entity78 people to have this debate and take this vote before adjourning for the year and i 'm pleased we 're on track to do so in the right way			0
" tv cameras will probably show up this time .			0
