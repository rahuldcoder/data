citing cost concerns , the @entity1 administration said friday it has halted a long - term care insurance program that was part of the massive health care law passed in 2010			1
called the @entity5 ( @entity6 ) , the program was canceled by @entity9 secretary @entity8 after a 19 - month effort to find a way to make it financially viable			2
in a letter to @entity13 , @entity8 wrote , " despite our best analytical efforts , i do not see a viable path forward for class implementation at this time			0
" the class program was similar to long - term care plans available in the private sector in which workers sign up and pay a monthly premium			1
it was voluntary and was to be paid for entirely by the premiums from those who signed up			0
in return , subscribers would get a daily benefit			0
but a senior administration official told @entity30 that there were big questions whether @entity6 could be self - sustaining even when the health care reform law was being considered by @entity13			1
and as a result , lawmakers specified that the @entity9 secretary had to determine that the program would be sustainable for 75 years before certifying it			2
the legislation had been championed by the late sen. @entity40 , @entity41			0
in a blog entry on @entity43 , @entity8 cited warnings that not enough young healthy people would sign up			0
" this could have led to a vicious cycle where premiums would have to be set higher and higher to cover the likely costs of benefits , leading fewer and fewer healthier people to sign up for the program , " she wrote			0
@entity8 said she was n't giving up			0
" so even as we suspend work on implementing @entity6 , we are recommitting ourselves to the ultimate goal of making sure @entity56 can get the long - term care they need , whether it 's a working - age mom with disabilities who needs daily support right now or a young man at his first job who wants to protect himself and his family against the possibility of huge long - term care costs in the future , " @entity8 wrote			1
@entity70 had long targeted the program as part of their effort to repeal president @entity1 's health care reform law			1
responding to the @entity8 decision , @entity77 @entity76 leader @entity75 said in a statement , " the @entity1 administration today acknowledged what they refused to admit when they passed their partisan health bill : the @entity5 was a budget gimmick that might enhance the numbers on a @entity87 bureaucrat 's spreadsheet but was destined to fail in the real world			1
" @entity89 said the @entity5 " is only one of the unwise , unsustainable components of an unwise , unsustainable law			2
" " we should repeal the @entity5 and the rest of the health spending law and replace it with the type of common - sense reforms that lower costs and @entity56 support , " @entity89 said .			2
