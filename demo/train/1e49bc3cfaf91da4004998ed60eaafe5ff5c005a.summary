@entity0 -- the paparazzi pursuit of @entity4 along @entity0 freeways is a " tragedy waiting to happen , " a @entity0 city councilman warned			1
@entity7 , who has sponsored tougher punishment for photographers who break the law while stalking celebrities , witnessed an example friday of why the practice is so dangerous			1
" i expected to see a crash , " said @entity7 , a 33 - year veteran of the @entity14 and still a reserve officer			1
" the danger is of someone getting killed			0
" @entity4 's @entity19 -- a $ 100,000 electric sports car -- looked like a silver bullet as it zoomed past @entity7 at 100 mph on @entity22 101 friday morning , he said			1
" he was coming up behind me , making abrupt lane changes , not giving signals , cutting off cars			0
" four or five other cars followed close behind , apparently carrying photographers stalking @entity4 , he said			1
" they were close by , at a rapid speed , all of them			0
" @entity34 considers battery charge against @entity4 " it 's like a miracle that nothing happened , " @entity7 said			1
" it was mere luck that no one got involved in a collision			0
" the high - speed chase , which @entity7 estimated went for 15 miles , ended when a @entity45 officer , alerted by @entity7 's call , stopped @entity4 and cited him for speeding			1
not only were the photographers not ticketed , but the officer allowed them to snap photos as @entity4 was cited			1
" he let all the paparazzi just around my vehicle while he was doing the whole citation , " @entity4 said in his own 911 call a few minutes later			1
@entity4 , sounding frustrated , called 911 for help after he resumed his drive toward downtown @entity0 , complaining that the same cars were chasing him again			1
the highway patrol wo n't release the recording of @entity4 's call until its investigation of the paparazzi 's pursuit is concluded , officer @entity57 said			2
but a copy was leaked to radio host @entity65 , who aired it on his syndicated morning show monday			0
" they 're being very dangerous , swerving around other cars trying to get to me , " @entity4 told the dispatcher			1
" and when i get to a stop they pull up next to me and just be , like , just harass me			0
" but unlike earlier , @entity4 said he was just driving 50 mph			2
" they 're driving really reckless , " he told the dispatcher			0
" they just will not stop following me			0
" @entity7 , who heard the call , criticized @entity4 for initially giving the dispatcher a fake name , @entity80 , and " hem - hawing " without explaining he was a celebrity being chased by photographers			1
" when you give information to a dispatcher , you want to be accurate			0
" but the dispatcher soon realized she was talking to @entity4 , who she knew had been stopped minutes earlier			1
" i was trying to go fast so that i could lose these people and i got pulled over			1
and then the police told me if they kept following me to call again , " @entity4 told her			2
@entity4 's ' believe ' year 's biggest debut when she asked him if he wanted a highway patrol unit to intervene and stop the cars from following him , he said , " i would love that			2
" when a patrol car caught up with @entity4 in downtown @entity0 15 minutes later , he filed a complaint which prompted a police investigation to see if any photographers will be charged with breaking @entity100 's paparazzi law , @entity57 said			1
a conviction under the law passed two years ago , and pushed by @entity7 , could bring up to a year in prison and a $ 5,000 fine for each count of breaking traffic laws while pursuing a celebrity			2
avoiding tragedy is up to the celebrity , since " he 's not going to get a police escort everywhere he goes , " @entity7 said			2
in @entity4 's case , his choice of a very visible , exotic sports car is not recommended , he said			2
" you 're waving the big flag that says ' here i am , ' " @entity7 said			2
" put that car in the garage for a while and get something that 's not as recognizable			0
" @entity4 officially graduates most celebrities realize this and drive less conspicuous vehicles , he said			0
@entity7 , who served much of his law enforcement career as a motorcycle officer , suggested that whenever @entity4 or other celebs are pursued by paparazzi they should " slow down , get off the freeway and call 911			1
" " the faster you go , the faster they 're going to go , " he said			0
no lives should be placed at risk , he said			0
" it 's not like they were trying to mug him , trying to kill him			0
they 're trying to take a picture , " @entity7 said			0
@entity7 compared friday 's scene to the paparazzi chase in @entity136 that ended with the crash that killed @entity139 's @entity138 15 years ago			2
" this is a tragedy waiting to happen , " he said " it will happen unless he is somehow restricted in his driving habits			0
" @entity4 sells out @entity22 tour in one hour			0
