-- thursday 's vice presidential debate will not receive nearly as much attention as the battles between @entity4 and president @entity5			1
after all , the debates between the vice presidential candidates are a bit like watching aaa baseball			1
right now , most voters are focused on the people running for the highest office in the land			0
nevertheless , vice presidential debates have a colorful history			1
although they do n't do much to affect the results of the actual campaign , they can have an effect on the future of a candidate 's career regardless of whether the ticket wins or loses			0
in several cases , promising stars have been badly harmed by their performances , developing public perceptions that proved hard to shake			0
opinion : @entity4 was hungry , @entity5 was flat with vice president @entity31 possibly considering a run for the presidency in 2016 and @entity35 rep. @entity34 widely considered to be one of the most promising stars of the @entity38 , both men have a lot to lose if their effort on thursday does not go well			0
in 1976 , sen. @entity41 , @entity42 , ripped into his opponent on many fronts , but he came off looking nasty and unnecessarily aggressive			1
some of his statements were so controversial that they raised questions about whether he was fit to hold the office , particularly because voters were still leery from the nastiness of president @entity53 's @entity52			0
during the debate @entity41 said that " if we added up the killed and wounded in @entity57 wars in this century , it would be about 1.6 million @entity59 , enough to fill the city of @entity61			1
" @entity62 seized on the statement , saying that " sen. @entity41 has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man			1
" that phrase stuck , even more than @entity41 's comments , and for many years @entity38 remained skeptical that @entity41 could be an effective presidential candidate because of this negative image			1
in 1988 , sen. @entity72 , running with @entity71 , picked apart sen. @entity73			1
the charismatic young conservative from @entity77 was a fresh voice in the party , a politician who many observers thought could be a new leader for the @entity38 down the road			0
this was why vice president @entity82 selected him as his running mate			0
news : stakes get higher in upcoming @entity31 - @entity34 debate when @entity73 , who had stumbled through some gaffes early after his announcement , likened himself to president @entity90 , @entity72 fired back : " i served with @entity90			1
@entity90 was a friend of mine			0
senator , you 're no @entity90			0
" the zinger played into fears that @entity73 was a lightweight who could not handle the obligations of the presidency			2
while @entity73 was on the winning ticket , his image took a big hit as a result of the debate and other events on the campaign trail			2
in 2004 , @entity108 sen. @entity107 , running with @entity110 sen. @entity109 , also suffered from his encounter with a more experienced candidate , vice president @entity112			1
at the time , @entity107 was one of the darlings of the @entity114 , a photogenic senator who spoke emotionally about the issues of poverty and inequality , something that energized the party 's base			2
but his performance in the debate was unsuccessful			0
opinion : millennials want candidates talk to us @entity112 dug into @entity107 , saying , " the first time i ever met you was when you walked onto the stage tonight , " a statement highlighting the accusation that @entity107 was more interested in advancing his career than politics and that he had constantly missed votes			1
when @entity107 brought up @entity112 's daughter @entity136 , who is gay , to challenge his opposition to gay marriage , @entity112 came back by saying , " let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter , " ending @entity107 ' assault on the spot			2
@entity107 ' performance left many uncomfortable			2
the senator looked like a lightweight , and many came away more skeptical about whether he could handle the pressures of the presidency			0
the 2008 debate between then - sen. @entity31 and @entity153 did n't have as many dramatic moments			1
still it was harmful to @entity153			1
the @entity157 governor entered the debate with low expectations after a series of botched television interviews led voters to question whether she was really qualified to hold higher office			0
during the debates , @entity153 did not do much to impress voters			1
her decision to evade certain questions and give vague responses to others continued to fuel discussion as to whether she was out of her league			0
what would you ask @entity31 , @entity34 ? some scratched their head when she asked her opponent , " can i call you @entity31 ? " at another point she admitted that she " may not answer the questions the way the moderator and you want to hear			0
" the performance became fodder for " @entity188 " comedians , with @entity185 playing @entity153 , constantly winking and talking about being a maverick without any substance			2
when the segment ends , @entity185 asks : " are we not doing the talent portion ? " ( a reference to @entity153 having been in the @entity157 competition			2
) opinion : will @entity195 be downsized ? it might be that following the first presidential debate , where @entity4 dramatically turned the media narrative in his favor and walked away with a major victory , that interest will be greater than usual in this vice presidential debate , and a decisive victory either way could play some role in the campaign			1
but the chances are still slim			0
regardless , we do know that poor performances in vice presidential debates can harm the chances for a candidate to run for higher office down the road			1
though they will obviously be focused on 2012 , both @entity34 and @entity31 will need to be careful not to act in ways that undercut their ability to run for the presidency four years from now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			2

@entity222 : vice presidential debates do n't usually sway outcome of elections
he says they can have an *outsized* *influence* on careers of the candidates
