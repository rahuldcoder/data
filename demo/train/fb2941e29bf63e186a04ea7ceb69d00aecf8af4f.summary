-- sunday has long been a day for reflection in @entity2 , @entity3 , with residents flocking to churches and other places of worship for guidance , understanding and a sense of community			1
now , several of those churches are gone , as are scores who might otherwise be going to them , thanks to a horrific tornado that ripped through the southwest @entity3 city one week ago			1
that makes this sunday especially significant , not to mention the subsequent days , as religious leaders try to offer meaning after such a senseless disaster			2
" you could see ... the challenge they are going to face , as they preach funerals in the weeks to come , " @entity3 gov. @entity21 said after meeting faith - based leaders this week			1
" @entity21 , along with president @entity30 , will be among those attending a special memorial service at @entity33 for the 142 killed ( as of saturday evening ) and thousands more affected by the tornado			1
@entity30 to view @entity2 tornado damage then at 5:41 p.m. -- exactly one week after an ef - 5 tornado , with winds over 200 mph , first touched down -- the city will go silent			1
that moment will be a stark contrast to the fury the rev. @entity42 experienced as the twister barrelled toward @entity44			1
the 70 - year - old pastor got in a bathtub at the church , put his face down and prayed			1
when the winds ceased , @entity42 found himself trapped in the rubble -- where he remained until some of his parishioners rescued him , unscathed			0
while he 's still coming to grips with what happened , @entity42 said he believes that good will come out of this tragedy and in fact already has			2
" @entity58 allows things to happen that we do n't know why , " the pastor said earlier this week			0
" but when we look back , we always hear the good things that happen as a result			0
" that positive energy was on display saturday on the church grounds			0
there , parishioners and volunteers picked through the debris looking for items to salvage , @entity42 said			0
one found the pastor 's @entity72 , and another was able to save his golf clubs			0
two tornado - wracked towns unite through tragedy , charity " the enthusiasm was unbelievable , even as people were shedding tears , " @entity42 said			1
" it 's just wonderful to see			0
" on sunday , @entity42 said he will celebrate @entity83 at @entity84 , another @entity85 in @entity2			1
and if and when his church is rebuilt -- something that he expects will happen , with the parish council 's support -- the pastor said a 6 - foot cross that somehow braved the storm will be a part of it , behind the altar			1
" we would n't dream of not using that , " he said			0
the @entity98 , a nondenominational @entity99 youth organization , has opened its doors to schools , relief agencies and churches in need of space			2
they include members of @entity109 's @entity108 , which will hold their sunday services at the ministries ' center after their own facility was severely damaged in the storm			2
@entity116 , the organization 's president , said he has been impressed that so many people , from near and far , offered help			2
food , water and clothing have come in everything from car trunks to tractor - trailers , he said , and the center 's parking lot has transformed into a distribution point for supplies			2
meanwhile , @entity116 said that locals directly affected have seen their faith strengthened in the past week			1
" @entity132 who understand that @entity58 creates order from chaos have stood up and done what it takes , " he said			0
" they have given up their lives			0
if they come up against roadblocks , they get around them and they get it done			0
" @entity0 's @entity144 and @entity145 contributed to this report .			0
