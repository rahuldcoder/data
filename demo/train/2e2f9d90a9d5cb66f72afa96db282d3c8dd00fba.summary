-- @entity1 laughs in the face of danger -- at least she does now			1
but it was n't always that way , for this was one kitesurfing tale which almost ended in tragedy			1
rewind 11 years and with her father @entity9 , a five time @entity11 senior champion , watching on in horror			1
@entity1 came within inches of serious injury -- and maybe even death			1
it was a moment which would have forced lesser beings into nightmares and cold sweats -- but not this @entity11 - born battler			1
" my dad was teaching me and i was going along fine , then all of a sudden then i was out of control and went flying through the sky , " @entity1 told @entity0 's human to @entity22			1
" i was getting dragged down with the kite and heading into the wavebreakers			2
" i thought i was going to hit the pier and that was scary , but i hit the ground and was in a daze			0
some guy came and helped tame my kite and made sure i stayed still			0
" when you crash in the water , the water turns into concrete , it 's not soft			0
you get a lot of whiplash in your neck and it gets flung back			0
" i was in a semiconscious state , a bit shaken up but that put me off for five years			0
looking back , i 'm just so relieved i gave it a second chance			0
" rising star kitesurfing is a fusion of some of the most exciting and challenging water sports , taking components of paragliding , surfing , windsurfing and wakeboarding before sprinkling some acrobatics and gymnastics on top for good measure			1
standing on a small board , the rider uses the wind to power the large kite , which propels it across the waves at rapid speed			0
since returning to action at the age of 15 , @entity1 has gone on to establish herself as one of @entity73 's rising stars -- an outcome which looked unlikely following her first ever event			1
on that occasion , the amateur competition ended in disappointment after she finished last , beaten by a considerable distance and defeated by a far more experienced field			2
it was to prove the turning point			0
" i was so embarrassed , " @entity1 recalled			1
" i could n't do any freestyle tricks and i came last			2
" i just sat there and thought , ' what am i doing here ? ' but that competition really inspired me and suddenly i said to myself , ' i 'm never going to be that bad again			2
' " i went out and trained as much as possible after that			0
" reaching the top that chastening experience powered @entity1 through months of training , hitting the waves at every opportunity despite the infamous @entity11 weather			1
at just 15 , @entity1 became the youngest ever female to win the @entity98 title , repeating the feat the following year at the professional championship			1
two more title wins followed in consecutive years as did the prestigious @entity103 / @entity102 off crown at the 2009 @entity106 competition			2
now at the age of 21 , and voted as the country 's most influential female kitesurfer , @entity1 has her sights set on reaching the very top			1
" i 'd really like to be @entity73 champion , " she added			1
" at the moment i feel as if i 'm not at my peak			0
i always want to push it and i think i 'm going to be going for some time			2
" there 's plenty of time for me to progress and have fun			2
" magical there 's certainly plenty of fun			0
@entity1 travels across the globe to some of the most exotic places to improve her kitesurfing skills			1
@entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 are just three of her favorite places -- although she retains an affection for her local beach at @entity134 in the north west of @entity136			0
but it does n't matter whether its brown water off the @entity11 coast or sharks lurking beneath sunnier climes , nothing puts @entity1 off taking her kite into the deep unknown			1
" it 's a pretty magical feeling when you 're out kitesurfing , " she added			2
" you 're looking back at the land , you 've got the whole ocean , and it 's just really special			0
" we 're using the wind , the sea and the waves			0
when it 's cold and windy you feel like you 're really in the elements , it 's great , you feel alive			0
" when i started to compete at the age of 15 it was a real eye - opener			1
i got to travel to some amazing places and it was definitely for me			0
" you have so much freedom on the water and it takes you to beautiful places you would n't normally go to			0
