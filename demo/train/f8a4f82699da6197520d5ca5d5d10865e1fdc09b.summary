-- substance abuse , addiction and its consequences cost @entity5 governmental bodies nearly $ 500 billion in 2005 with only a fraction of state and federal dollars spent on prevention and treatment , according to a report released thursday			1
a report suggests a small amount of state and federal funds is spent on drug prevention and treatment			1
of the $ 373.9 billion spent by federal and state governments , some 95.6 percent was spent to " shovel up the consequences and human wreckage of substance abuse and addiction , " while only 1.9 percent was spent on prevention and treatment , 1.4 percent on taxation and regulation , and less than 1 percent on research and interdiction , says the report from @entity31 's @entity30			1
in fact , for every dollar spent to prevent and treat substance abuse , federal and state governments spent more than $ 50 on public programs aimed at addressing its effects , the report says			1
spending breakdowns for local governments were not available because of data limitations , the report says			0
" despite a significant and growing body of knowledge documenting that addiction is a preventable , treatable and manageable disease , and despite the proven efficacy of prevention and treatment techniques , our nation still looks the other way while substance abuse and addiction cause illness , injury , death and crime , savage our children , overwhelm social service systems , impede education -- and slap a heavy and growing tax on our citizens , " @entity43 , the addiction center 's vice president and director of policy research and analysis , said in a written statement			1
the center found that federal , state and local governments spent some $ 467.7 billion on substance abuse - related costs , including health care , justice systems and family court , child welfare and homelessness			1
the figures are for 2005 , the most recent year for which data was available over the course of the study , the center said			0
the report , " @entity84 : the @entity88 on @entity89 , " resulted from three years of research and analysis , according to the addiction center			2
the vast majority of state and federal spending , 71.1 percent , was spent on health care and the justice system , the report says			2
" increasing costs in these areas are devastating state budgets , while health care costs are consuming a larger and larger share of federal spending			0
" the center found that if substance abuse and addiction were its own category within the federal budget , it would rank sixth in size behind @entity107 , national defense , @entity109 and two other programs , consuming 9.6 percent of the entire budget			1
for states , 15.7 percent of budgets were spent on substance abuse , which is up from 13.3 percent in the 1998 " @entity84 " report , which examined only state spending			1
if substance abuse were a state budget category , it would rank no. 2 , behind elementary and secondary education , the report says			1
" states spend more on substance abuse and addiction than they spend on @entity126 , higher education , transportation or justice , " it says			2
for every $ 100 state governments spent on substance abuse , they spent an average of $ 2.38 on prevention , treatment and research , the study found			1
@entity138 spent the most , with $ 10.39 ; @entity139 the least , with 22 cents			1
in every case , the @entity30 said , it made the most conservative assumptions			0
and it could n't even figure in some costs -- higher education , tobacco and drug - related developmental disabilities and highway accidents linked to illicit or controlled prescription drug use , among others -- because of data limitations , so the actual amounts spent are likely even higher			0
the report advocates that more funding and efforts be directed toward prevention and treatment , rather than cleaning up the wreckage that substance abuse leaves in its wake			1
" under any circumstances , spending more than 95 percent of taxpayer dollars on the crime , health care costs , child abuse , domestic violence , homelessness and other consequences of tobacco , alcohol and illegal and prescription drug abuse and addiction , and only 2 percent to relieve individuals and taxpayers of these burdens , is a reckless misallocation of public funds , " @entity161 , a former @entity5 secretary of health , education and welfare who founded the addiction center and serves as its chairman , said in the statement			2
" in these economic times , such upside - down - cake public policy is unconscionable			0
it 's past time for this fiscal and human waste to end			0
" the report calls for a sharper focus on prevention , especially aimed at children			0
it points to the success of the @entity196 's " truth " campaign on youth smoking , and says similar campaigns are needed to target drug abuse and underage drinking			0
merely blaming those who made the choice to begin using alcohol or drugs or to start smoking does not work , the report points out			0
" when use of these substances progresses to the point of meeting medical criteria for abuse or addiction , changes have occurred in the brain which make cessation of use extraordinarily difficult			0
... the bottom line is that while an individual is responsible for his or her actions related to the disease , the disease must be treated			0
" but perhaps one of the most important recommendations in the report is this : @entity5 needs to shift its culture and attempt to dispel stigmas surrounding substance abuse			2
the center points to a similar shift that occurred regarding the @entity234 virus : " in a matter of a few years , @entity234 went from being seen as a social curse to being recognized as a serious , treatable disease			0
it 's time for the public health community to mount a similar effort with respect to alcohol and other drug abuse and addiction , to move the nation from stigmatizing it to recognizing it as a disease			2

nearly $ *468* billion was spent in 2005 on substance abuse , addiction , report says
