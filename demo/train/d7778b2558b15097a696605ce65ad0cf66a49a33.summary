-- if you love the films of @entity3 and @entity4 , you know that they always look at the world through jaundiced , snark - colored glasses ; they 'll never be warm and toasty			0
that quality of metaphysical cynicism runs through all my favorite @entity4 films , from " @entity13 " to " @entity14 " to " a serious man			0
" but i was still taken aback to see their jokey misanthropy applied to " @entity18 , " a tale set in the achingly sincere @entity21 folk - music scene of 1961			1
@entity18 ( @entity22 ) is a musician who 's the definition of '' struggling			1
'' he 's a talented scrounger , crashing on his friends ' couches and living off the pass - around basket after gigs			1
really , he 's a step away from dereliction			2
' @entity18 ' : @entity22 , @entity32 , and the @entity33 perform a song from the film the film opens with @entity37 performing a song at the @entity39 , and he 's a terrific singer — direct , emotional , and pure			1
@entity22 , the @entity40 - born actor and musician who plays him , has hooded dark eyes set off here by a thick beard and unruly black hair ( he 's like @entity46 as a hipster rabbinical student )			1
he gives @entity48 an earnest , dweeby - sexy @entity50 solidity			0
but " @entity18 " is about how life has played a cosmic joke on @entity48			2
the quiet , humble folk scene , though no one really knows it yet , is fading ; it 's about to be washed over by the tidal wave of @entity58 , and by the pop commercialization represented by @entity60			1
prize fighter : best actor shapes up as the @entity64 ' toughest race @entity37 is friendly with a musician couple , @entity67 ( @entity66 ) and @entity68 ( @entity69 ) , who is pregnant — possibly by @entity37 , whom she despises			0
when @entity72 get up on stage to perform '' @entity74 , '' we 're meant to see that the song , in its lilting loveliness , spells the end for singers like @entity37			0
he was once part of a duo himself , but his singing partner killed himself by jumping off the @entity82 , and @entity37 , having gone solo , is now a desperate jerk who treats people like crap because he 's hurting deep down inside			0
the @entity87 bring the @entity88 to life with a spangly authenticity that leaps off the screen			0
there 's now a " @entity95 " fascination to this era , and the @entity87 capture how the wintry streets and scuzzy apartments — the peeling - paint rooms and comically narrow hallways — were romantic in their very discomfort			0
you had to want to be in the @entity21 , playing folk songs for peanuts ( sometimes literally )			1
and @entity18 , though not a nice guy , has that spirit			2
top 10 movies of ' 13 : @entity107 ... the film charts his downward spiral , and for a while i wondered : why introduce a hero with talent only to mock his dreams ? yet the more i watched " @entity18 , " the more i saw that there is something indelible in the @entity87 ' vision of a morosely gifted loser slipping through the cracks			1
when @entity37 goes into the studio to help record a satirical novelty song called '' please mr. @entity122 , '' the movie seems to have the makings of an ebullient folk musical			2
but the @entity87 are way too sardonic for that			0
with " @entity18 , " they 've made a film that is almost spooky in its perversity : a lovingly lived - in , detailed tribute to the folk scene that — hauntingly — has shut their hero out			1
