@entity0 -- in a recent interview , @entity2 , the opposition candidate spearheading the @entity3 in @entity4 , said that early in the momentous revolution of 1979 the majority of @entity4 were convinced that dictatorship had ended in @entity4			1
" i was one of those people , " @entity2 said			2
" but today i no longer believe that to be the case			2
" today , he said , we can see both the signs of dictatorship and the resistance to that dictatorship			2
he then claimed this resistance as a legacy of the @entity20			0
" it must be said that people 's resistance is a heritage of the @entity20			1
people 's discontent with deceit , deception , and corruption , which we witness today , are among the clear signs of this heritage , " @entity2 said			1
but the history and the political culture of revolt against tyranny actually predate the @entity38 revolution of 1977 - 1979			1
the young @entity4 pouring into the streets of their homeland in recent months to demand their civil liberties are nourished and inspired by the same fountain of liberty that moved their parents in the years leading up to the 1979 revolution			1
it is the same hunger for freedom that the @entity51 , for eight crucial years under the steady hand of @entity2 himself as prime minister in the 1980s , had brutally repressed			0
what we are witnessing in the streets of @entity4 and among @entity4 around the globe is the resurgence of a vibrant political culture that gave rise to the 1979 revolution , and that has been violently eclipsed under the absolutism of a militant @entity38 theocracy			1
the history of the @entity51 over the last three decades has been a sad scenario of suppression and brutality			2
the regime has mismanaged one crisis after another , benefiting at times from the follies of neighbors and superpowers			2
before the creation of the @entity51 , the revolution was driven by @entity4 rebelling against the tyrannical monarchy of the @entity76			1
but for the new regime in @entity4 , the @entity78 hostage crisis of 1979 - 1980 was the first opportunity to create a smoke screen to divert the world 's attention while taking @entity4 's entire political culture hostage to their single - mindedly @entity86 approach			1
the @entity78 hostage crisis had not ended yet when the @entity88 ( 1980 - 1988 ) started -- yet another prolonged and brutal distraction that @entity90 used to eliminate all his internal opposition			0
he did not start the war with @entity93			0
@entity94 did , with the full support of the @entity97 administration and its @entity99 and @entity100 allies			0
but @entity90 prolonged it for his own reasons			0
two years into the @entity88 , the @entity103 invaded @entity104 in 1982 , and thereby offered the @entity51 the best opportunity to help create the @entity104 @entity106 and extend its regional power base			0
the @entity88 was still raging when the @entity108 ( 1987 - 1993 ) provided the @entity51 with yet another opportunity to expand its influence in occupied @entity111			0
the @entity88 had barely ended when in 1989 @entity90 issued his infamous fatwa against @entity113			0
this provided another diversion to distract the world 's attention from his having ordered a crucial revision of the constitution of the @entity51 that would perpetuate the absolutist reign of a @entity121			2
just about the same time , @entity94 invaded @entity123 , the @entity122 took over @entity124 , and the two monsters the @entity78 and its @entity99 , regional , and @entity100 allies had created to control the spread of the @entity4 revolution came back to haunt them all and turn against their own creators			1
the tragic events of september 11 , 2001 , plunged the @entity78 into a deep quagmire of mismanaging one crisis after another in @entity124 and @entity93 , as the @entity103 invasion of @entity104 in 2006 and @entity136 in 2008 - 2009 added fuel to the fire among @entity100 and @entity139			0
with every turn of the screw and as the @entity78 was bogged down in the region , the @entity51 did what it does best : it took advantage of one crisis after another in the region to stay afloat and disguise its fundamentally weak claim to legitimacy among its own citizens			0
today the @entity3 is threatened by a number of factors and forces			1
a brutal suppression by the security apparatus of the @entity51 is only the most immediate and evident threat			0
equally dangerous is to think the @entity3 is an @entity78 - inspired , or " pro-western " uprising that will turn @entity4 into a satellite state of the @entity78 and make it safe for neoliberal economics			1
it is not -- and to drive that point home , it is still good to read @entity2 invoking the memory of a vast social revolution that had a fundamental commitment to social and economic justice at its heart			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			1

@entity4 has suffered through decades of political repression , says @entity172
he says @entity4 's regime has benefited from *turmoil* in the @entity178
@entity4 's @entity3 is a new generation following in *footsteps* of its parents ' bid for liberty
