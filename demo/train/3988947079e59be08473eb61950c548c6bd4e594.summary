-- conflicting reports hit the international media this week about whether @entity4 leader @entity3 was negotiating a deal with the opposition for a guaranteed safe exit if he relinquished power			1
speculation percolated again wednesday after few details were available about a private @entity4 aircraft that landed in @entity12 , @entity13			2
but two questions remain : will @entity3 ever step down , and if he did , where would he go ? @entity3 is sure not to go down easily			1
he has defiantly vowed to die a martyr on @entity4 soil and declared on state television , " i am @entity4			2
" at the moment , he has leverage , said @entity21 , a senior fellow at the @entity22			0
those who have studied the strongman 's megalomanic ways agree that he would probably not retreat from his revolution or his country without a fight to the end			2
analysts have raised the grim prospect of a protracted , bloody war in the vein of @entity34			0
" the tipping point was n't reached quickly enough , " @entity21 said			0
" now , this has turned into something that got stuck			0
" but if it came to a do - or - die scenario , @entity3 , despite his bravado , would look for a way out , @entity21 said			1
there is no possibility of power - sharing , so if the opposition were to oust him , @entity3 would have to leave the country , as @entity49 president @entity48 and others have already urged him to do			1
but few would be willing to welcome a man with such a tarnished reputation , reinforced in recent weeks by the bloody crackdown on unarmed protesters , analysts said			0
@entity57 's name pops up in discussions of this nature ; after all , @entity62 's ousted president @entity61 @entity60 fled into exile in the @entity65 kingdom			0
and there were rumors at one time that @entity13 president @entity68 would do the same			0
but @entity3 is another matter			1
his relationship with @entity57 @entity71 is , to put it mildly , strained , especially after the @entity57 accused @entity4 of an assassination attempt on the king several years back			0
" i would be extremely surprised if he went to @entity57 , " said @entity75 , a @entity57 expert at the @entity76			0
@entity75 suggested that @entity78 of @entity79 might be more amenable to taking in @entity3			1
the @entity4 leader 's adoption of pan-african solidarity drew him closer to the @entity79 dictator			1
the relationship between the two nations blossomed also from the leaders ' shared anti-colonial fervor and a realpolitik bond of being isolated nations , according to @entity75			0
others have suggested that @entity3 could find a home in @entity92 or @entity93			1
president @entity94 of @entity93 is considered @entity3 's main ally in @entity96 , a love born , again , from a mutual distaste for @entity100 " imperialism			1
" when the uprising began to escalate in @entity4 last month , rumors surfaced that @entity3 had already fled to @entity103 , the @entity93 capital			1
@entity21 listed one more possible future home for the @entity4 strongman : @entity106			1
@entity107 , an analyst with the global intelligence company @entity108 , said @entity3 has reportedly sought friendship from @entity111 leader @entity110 and tried to shore up that alliance			2
but even the @entity111 , said @entity107 , are less than enthused			0
@entity114 nations , @entity107 said , would suit @entity3 's sons just fine but not the eccentric leader , who has been famously known to travel with female bodyguards and sleep under a tent , even when he came to @entity119 to address the @entity120			2
after all , she said , @entity3 remains a hardcore @entity121			2
and for the moment , it seems , he will remain in his @entity121 homeland , unwilling to let go of 40 years of power .			0

there has been speculation about @entity3 making an exit deal
but the strongman appears as defiant as ever
if he were to flee , he would have few options on where to go
@entity79 , @entity93 and @entity106 could take him in
