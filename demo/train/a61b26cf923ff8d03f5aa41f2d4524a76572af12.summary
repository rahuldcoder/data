in its ruling last week on the national health care law , the @entity0 found that penalties the law places on people who do n't buy health insurance count as a tax protected by the @entity8			1
the @entity10 administration had argued that the fees should be considered a penalty			1
but the government also argued that the individual mandate can be viewed as constitutional under @entity16 ' powers of taxation			1
the high court rejected the " penalty " argument			2
" the payment is not so high that there is really no choice but to buy health insurance ; the payment is not limited to willful violations , as penalties for unlawful acts often are ; and the payment is collected solely by the ( @entity32 ) through the normal means of taxation , " chief justice @entity21 wrote in the decision			1
the court noted that the law calls for no other punishments for refusal to buy health insurance			0
" indeed , it is estimated that four million people each year will choose to pay the @entity32 rather than buy insurance , " the decision said , citing figures from the @entity42			0
" we would expect @entity16 to be troubled by that prospect if such conduct were unlawful			0
" what the ruling means to you but on the taxation argument , the court agreed			0
the @entity8 allows @entity16 to tax and spend , giving the federal government " considerable influence even in areas where it can not directly regulate , " the decision said			0
the mandate " looks like a tax in many respects , " @entity21 wrote			1
the money is to be paid by people when they file their tax returns and does not apply to those who pay no federal income taxes ; the amount someone owes " is determined by such familiar factors as taxable income , number of dependents , and joint filing status , " and the " requirement to pay is found in the @entity74 and enforced by the @entity32			2
" the high court overturned a unanimous decision by the 11th @entity78 @entity77 that the mandate did not impose a tax			2
the @entity0 also ruled that it could proceed with considering the constitutionality of the tax despite the @entity83 , which dates back 145 years			1
the law said lawsuits ca n't be used to prevent taxing , only to get refunded for taxes already paid			0
the high court said whether something is a tax for the purposes of the @entity83 is @entity16 ' decision -- and since @entity16 designated the mandate as including a penalty rather than a tax , the law did not apply in this case			1
" it is up to @entity16 whether to apply the @entity83 to any particular statute , so it makes sense to be guided by @entity16 's choice of label on that question			1
that choice does not , however , control whether an exaction is within @entity16 's constitutional power to tax			2
" the court emphasized that it was not weighing in on whether the mandate is a good idea			0
" because the @entity8 permits such a tax , it is not our role to forbid it , or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness , " the decision said			0
how are you affected by the ruling ? share with us on @entity121 .			0
