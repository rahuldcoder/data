editor 's note : a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 is the author of " listening to the @entity4 " and " speak , @entity5 ! a @entity7 's view of @entity8			1
" visit his web site for more information			0
he is hosting " @entity14 " at 8 p.m. et on @entity11 while @entity12 is on maternity leave			0
@entity2 says there 's an assumption the word " qualified " needs to be used for women , minorities			1
( @entity11 ) -- i could n't help but laugh this morning when i saw the headline for a debate on @entity22 : " should @entity23 feel obliged to appoint a qualified woman , @entity25 or @entity26 to the @entity27 ? if so , why , and on what basis should he choose among these groups ? " hmmm			1
a " qualified " woman , african - american or @entity26			0
my first thought ? hell no ! give me the most unqualified person to sit on the highest court in the land ! yeah , right			0
it 's always amazing when diversity is discussed that people feel the need to use the qualifier " qualified			0
" if you think about it , there never seems to be an assumption when white men are being discussed that they are unqualified			1
their qualification is simply assumed and is inherent in their whiteness and maleness			0
sure , go ahead and say , " man , you 're being too sensitive ! " but i do want you to think about this for a second			0
why do we as a society feel the need to say it 's important to have " qualified " women or minorities ? is n't that assumed ? if president @entity23 is going to pick a @entity27 justice , it never has dawned on me that he will grab a list of people who are n't capable of doing the job			1
the thought never even enters my mind			0
part of the issue is that a lot of folks have bought into the notion that any minority has gotten a job based on their skin color or a woman is hired because of her gender , so therefore , we better emphasize the need for a " qualified " person			1
you ought to see some of the e-mails i 've gotten from folks who think they are hurting my feelings by saying i 'm a " quota " or " affirmative action " hire and took the job of " a deserving white person			2
" oh , yeah , these are a part of the greatest hits in my inbox			0
a few years ago , i recall a white female news director in @entity95 who often reveled in her liberal way of thinking			0
she would go on and on about being a white liberal but would often talk about how hard it was to find " qualified " minorities for jobs			1
then i would look at some of the most incompetent white men and women who worked for her and ask myself , " i wonder if they passed the qualified test ? " another time , i challenged a white male recruiter on the term , and he would just say over and over , " you , know , qualified			1
" and i kept pressing him on whether he asks the same question of someone white , and he could n't answer the question			2
now , i 'm sure the folks who despise affirmative action will quickly say , " see , if it were n't for affirmative action , no one would even use such terms ! " yeah , right			0
in the 17 years i 've been a professional journalist , i 've seen unqualified white men , white women and , yes , minorities hired and promoted , and affirmative action had nothing to do with it			1
people make hiring decisions based on the flimsiest of reasons , whether it 's what schools they went to ( such as assuming everyone from an @entity130 school is the best ; no , some are incompetent ) , they know the right people , or they were so " articulate " that they were given a shot			0
and yes , i 've seen a host of qualified white men , white women , african - americans , hispanics , @entity140 and native americans hired for jobs , and they 've done a fantastic job			1
it was n't their race or gender that was the key ; they simply had the skills to do the job			2
it 's simply time that when it comes to women or minorities , we should retire the use of word " qualified			1
" every job , regardless of a group targeted , should be filled with a person with the right talents , smarts and energy to get the job done			2
hiring the best should automatically mean they are qualified			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : why is n't the word " qualified " used often for white men ?
he says " qualified " is often applied to idea of hiring women , minorities
he says every job should be filled with someone who has talent to *succeed*
