@entity0 , @entity1 -- a vicious turf war between drug cartels and @entity1 authorities that has left as many as 4,300 dead so far this year may have caused a breach in the internal security systems of @entity8 , the international police organization			1
a member of the @entity10 participates in an narcotics operation			2
@entity8 , which is based in @entity12 , announced wednesday it is sending a team of investigators to @entity1 to investigate the possibility that its communications systems and databases are not being used for legitimate law enforcement purposes			1
the prospect was raised after the arrest of the top official working with the agency in the country			0
@entity25 , director for @entity26 at @entity1 's @entity10 and the head of @entity1 's @entity8 office , was placed under house arrest sunday , the attorney general 's office said tuesday			1
more than 30 officials have been arrested since july in connection with the anti-corruption @entity32 , an ongoing investigation into information leaks by law enforcement officials to drug traffickers , said @entity37 , a government press secretary in @entity0			2
@entity39 can be held for up to 40 days while authorities " obtain sufficient evidence to determine his probable responsibility , " the attorney general 's office said in a news release			2
@entity45 , a former top official at the @entity10 , also is under 40 - day house arrest			0
he was arrested october 29			0
@entity1 's @entity8 office , or @entity48 , is staffed and run by the @entity10			1
@entity1 officials did not offer specifics on their investigation other than to say that @entity32 , which means " @entity52 , " is aimed " against public servants who give reserved information to people not authorized to have it			1
" @entity8 said in a news release wednesday it needs to make sure the agency 's information remains secure			1
" as @entity1 's attorney general 's office has a duty to ensure that @entity8 's communications system and databases are being used for legitimate law enforcement purposes and in compliance with @entity8 's rules , @entity8 is immediately dispatching a team of general secretariat staff to @entity1 , " @entity8 said			1
" the purpose of their mission is to meet with relevant @entity1 authorities in order to establish if there are any allegations of improper use of @entity8 's systems by any @entity1 law enforcement official			1
" after the investigation , @entity8 said , the agency will determine whether proper security steps have been taken			2
" an assessment can then be made of the procedures put in place by the attorney general 's office , which is responsible for the @entity8 office in @entity1 , to ensure that @entity8 's rules and regulations are being followed , " the agency said			1
the arrests came amid " a war of master proportions " between authorities and narcotics traffickers that has left more than 4,300 dead so far this year , according to the @entity95 , an independent research and information organization			2
by comparison , the council said in a report tuesday , there were 2,700 drug - related deaths in 2007			2
" homegrown drug cartels operating from both within and outside the country are engaging in a vicious turf war to seize control of major trafficking corridors while engaging in almost open warfare against the mobilized forces of the state , " the council says about what it calls " narco - fueled crime			1
" @entity1 leaders have been trying to tamp down the violence by tightening controls on money - laundering and cracking down on corruption among local and municipal police forces infiltrated by drug traffickers			1
it may not be enough			0
" due to pervasive corruption at the highest levels of the @entity1 government , and the almost effortless infiltration of the porous security forces by the cartel , an ultimate victory by the state is far from certain , " the @entity121 concludes			2
drug trafficking in @entity1 is a $ 20 billion - to $ 50 billion - a - year industry , as much as the nation earns from tourism or remittances from @entity1 living in the @entity135 , said @entity136 , a former national security adviser to president @entity137 and now a professor of international relations at @entity140 in @entity141			2
he has been studying @entity142 for more than four decades			0
" this is a huge industry with an extraordinary capacity to corrupt and intimidate the country			0
and they 're doing both right now , " said @entity136 , also a former director of the @entity147 's @entity142 and @entity146			0
the drug cartels are paying some @entity1 officials bribes of $ 150,000 to $ 450,000 a month , authorities have said			1
the payment is far beyond the per capita income of $ 12,500 a year in @entity1 , where one of every seven @entity1 lives in poverty , according to the @entity156			2
pastor believes that @entity1 president @entity158 , who took office in december 2006 , made a correct assessment that he needs to fight the drug cartels as hard as he can			1
" you have to obviously escalate the cost of violating the law , " he said			0
the @entity135 also could help more , he said			0
" there are 7,600 gun shops within 50 miles of the @entity1 border , and they 're selling primarily to drug lords , " @entity136 said			1
" we are part of this problem and we have n't been significantly supportive			0
" and while the war may never be completely won , the government can make vast gains , as happened in @entity175 , he said			0
pastor was in @entity1 giving a speech last week when @entity175 president @entity178 met with @entity1 's @entity158			1
@entity1 were quite taken with @entity178 's message on how to fight drug traffickers , @entity136 said			1
the first step that @entity178 took , he said , was to take the fight to the paramilitary forces , the drug traffickers and the leftist guerrillas known as @entity186 , who often work in collaboration with the traffickers			0
also , @entity136 said , @entity175 officials " used money the same way that the narcotraffickers do -- to bribe people			0
and there 's a lot more security on the streets and everywhere else , so people feel safer			0
" despite the gains , he said , the ultimate answer may have to come from the political arena , not from law enforcement			0
" there 's no easy solution to it unless you put an end to the criminalization drugs , and that 's not going to happen , " pastor said			0
