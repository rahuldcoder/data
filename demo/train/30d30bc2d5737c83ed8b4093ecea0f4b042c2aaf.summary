-- the @entity3 government is requesting a quick and transparent investigation into the fatal shooting by a @entity7 @entity6 agent of a @entity3 teen in @entity9 on monday night , the @entity1 said tuesday			1
the teen was shot during a rock - throwing incident , @entity3 and @entity7 officials said			1
@entity3 " reiterates that the use of firearms to repel a rock attack represents a disproportionate use of force , particularly coming from authorities who receive specialized training on the matter , " the @entity1 said tuesday in a news release			1
the teen 's death was the second at the hands of @entity7 border authorities in less than two weeks			1
monday night 's incident started around 6:30 p.m. when @entity31 agents responded to a report of a group of suspected illegal immigrants being smuggled into the @entity7 near the @entity36 port of entry , @entity28 special agent @entity27 said			1
a suspect identified as @entity38 was initially detained on the @entity40 levee , said the @entity28 , which is leading the investigation			2
" another agent arrived on his bicycle along the cement apron that forms the riverbank on the @entity7 side , " @entity27 said in a release			1
" that agent detained a second subject , @entity50 , but other subjects ran into @entity3 and began to throw rocks at the agent			2
" this agent , who had the second subject detained on the ground , gave verbal commands to the remaining subjects to stop and retreat , " @entity27 said			0
" however , the subjects surrounded the agent and continued to throw rocks at him			0
the agent then fired his service weapon several times , striking one subject who later died			0
" @entity27 told @entity0 earlier that she did not know whether the person who was shot was on the @entity3 or @entity7 side of the border , but that the agent never left @entity7 territory			1
the body was found on the @entity3 side of the border , @entity27 said			2
the attorney general 's office in @entity76 identified the dead 14 - year - old boy as secondary student @entity78			1
@entity79 said @entity80 had been shot in the head			0
" the young man was not armed , " @entity9 spokesman @entity82 said			0
" he did not have the physical size to threaten anyone			0
the aggression ( by the @entity7 agent ) is evident			2
" the shooting occurred underneath the @entity90 , a railroad span that connects the two countries , the @entity3 official said			1
the @entity28 said the " area where this incident occurred is a known high - risk crime area where rocks are regularly thrown at @entity6 agents and where other assaults have been reported			1
" the @entity28 , which has jurisdiction in any assault on a federal officer , is leading the @entity7 investigation with assistance from the @entity104 , the @entity6 and other federal agencies , @entity27 said			1
the shooting comes less than two weeks after the may 31 death of a @entity3 illegal immigrant who had been detained three days earlier by border agents in @entity110			1
@entity112 police , who are investigating the death of @entity80 , said he was beaten with a baton and shot with a stun gun after he became combative			2
@entity110 medical officials ruled his death a homicide			0
the investigation in that case continues			0
@entity3 officials complained tuesday that they see an increasing trend			2
" the growing frequency of this type of event reflects a worrisome increment in the use of excessive force on the part of some border authorities , " the @entity1 said			0
according to the ministry , the number of @entity3 who have been killed or wounded by @entity7 border authorities has increased from five in 2008 to 12 in 2009 and 17 so far this year			1
@entity137 , a spokesman for @entity138 , said he could not comment because he does not know where the @entity3 government obtained its statistics			2
but @entity137 said there were 799 assaults on border agents from october 1 , 2009 , through may 31 , up from 745 assaults for the same time period in 2007 - 08 and 658 for the same span in 2008 - 09			0
lethal force , he said , is allowed " when an agent is in imminent threat of physical or bodily harm , which could cause death or injury or in protection of an innocent third party			0
" the determination of when to use lethal force , @entity137 said , is made by each individual agent at the scene			0
from october 1 through may 31 , he said , @entity161 and @entity162 agents have used their firearms 31 times			0
rock - throwing can be considered a dangerous assault , @entity137 said : " they 're not chunking pebbles			1
" @entity0 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
