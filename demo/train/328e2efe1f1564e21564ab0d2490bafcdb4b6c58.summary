the glossy spread in " @entity1 " a magazine for pot devotees , showcases the " strongest strains on @entity4			2
" the most recent rankings are topped by " @entity6 , " which is grown in a hydroponic system and fed with a carefully calibrated dose of synthetic nutrients			2
on " @entity10 , " a @entity12 - based website where medical marijuana users share notes , cannabis connoisseurs sing the praises of " @entity17 " and rave about the " @entity18 , which tastes like a berry vanilla smoothie			1
" another medical site touts a bud " finished with a subtle fruit effect ... offering a deep body stone with a creative mind high , " and warns it is " not for newbies or low - tolerance patients			1
" the descriptions evoke images of a wine - tasting club -- albeit one with a few eccentrics			1
but increasingly it seems the most valued trait among these weed admirers is pure knockout power			2
dr. @entity35 : why i changed my mind on weed the intoxicating chemical in marijuana is tetrahydracannabinol , or @entity42			1
while a handful of growers are finessing strains to provide a medical benefit without the high the majority aim to push @entity42 content as high as it will go according to government data			1
in the annual @entity52 competition , where marijuana enthusiasts gather to try pot from various places and vote on their favorites , the most potent strains have a @entity42 content of around 25 % , according to testing commissioned by the organizers at @entity1			1
but at the @entity61 , in a laboratory that tracks the potency of marijuana seized by federal law enforcement officers , they 've found even higher levels -- as high as 37 % , according to dr. @entity67 , the director of the @entity68			1
since 1972 , @entity71 says , the average @entity42 content of marijuana has soared from less than 1 % to 3 to 4 % in the 1990s , to nearly 13 % today			1
legalizing pot is n't about medicine , it 's about getting high " you really have to be careful , " he says			2
" the danger of this high - potency material is not with the experienced marijuana smokers , but young people who really do n't know what they 're smoking			1
they do n't know what to expect , and before they know it , they 've inhaled too much			2
" fortunately , the risk of overdose with marijuana is far less serious than with cocaine or heroin			1
but certain behaviors -- like driving -- can be deadly if you 're acutely intoxicated			2
" the risk is not that you 'll stop breathing or that you 'll die , " says dr. @entity92 , a psychiatrist in @entity93 who studies the history and science of cannabis			0
" the risk is that you 'll become very altered and disoriented , and you can get anxious and panicky in that situation			0
" the only cure is a few hours of waiting , and reassurance			0
more than 455,000 patients entered emergency rooms with marijuana in their system in 2011 , a 19 % increase from just two years earlier according to government statistics			1
the figure represents all patients with marijuana in their system , whether or not the @entity113 visit is related to the drug			1
but most experts agree that along with showing an increase in usage , those numbers also indicate an increase in marijuana - related problems			1
" there 's an increase in psych admissions , " says dr. @entity121 , a psychiatrist who estimates that upwards of 1 in 100 people using high - @entity42 marijuana experience psychotic symptoms			1
as president of the @entity130 , @entity121 also worries about the long - term impact			1
psychiatrist leads crusade to legalize marijuana " if you look at marijuana , the intensity has changed			1
so i would expect it to have a somewhat higher addictive potential			0
" dr. @entity140 , who runs an addiction treatment center in @entity142 , agrees that there is a trend toward heavier use			2
he 's seen steadily higher levels of @entity42 metabolites in clients ' urine tests when they enter his program			1
" it 's more difficult to get kids clean , " @entity140 says , " because they come in less motivated for treatment , and more addicted			0
" with marijuana , the notion of addiction is complicated			1
going cold turkey does n't cause debilitating or life - threatening withdrawal symptoms , as it does for heavy alcohol or heroin users			2
mention " addiction " to many users and you 'll get a raised eyebrow			2
still , some do report anxiety , insomnia or nausea when they try to kick the habit			0
many experts cite a 1994 @entity175 report , which says that roughly 9 % of marijuana users eventually meet the criteria for " dependence			1
" but others are skeptical			0
" there have always been high - @entity42 content cigarettes around , " says @entity180 , a neuroscientist at @entity181 who studies the physical effects of cannabis and other drugs			1
" the modest increases that we see today are not as concerning as has been made out to be			0
" just as people drink hard liquor differently from beer , says @entity180 , they do n't smoke highly potent cannabis the way they use weaker stuff			0
in his lab , for example , study participants are given three minutes to smoke a marijuana cigarette			2
" if we give them a low dose , they suck down the whole thing			0
with stronger material , you 'll see them give back the other half			0
" for most people , that seems to translate to the real world , whether the purpose of smoking is medicinal or recreational			0
" the new stuff is a bit more potent than it was 20 years ago when i started smoking , " says @entity212 , the editor of @entity1			0
" the end result for me is that i smoke a lot less of it			0
" marijuana stops child 's severe seizures " people are looking for strains that are higher in quality , because they 'd rather smoke less , " echoes dr. @entity222 , a physician in @entity223 who writes approval letters for medical marijuana patients			2
@entity212 thinks there 's an unmet demand			0
" if people came out with boutique strains that are not so potent , people would buy them			0
" but for most of his patients , @entity222 says high quality means high @entity42			1
smoking anything is problematic in terms of health , because of irritation to the throat and lungs			0
but with marijuana , @entity92 makes the point that it 's actually a method of ingestion			2
by comparison , pot brownies and other edibles make it easy to miss your target high			0
" sometimes you do n't feel it coming on for two hours , and you end up eating more			0
and sometimes the dose with these edibles is half a cookie , or a quarter of a cookie			0
and i do n't know too many people who can eat only half a cookie , " says @entity92			0
part of it is the difficulty of gauging the dose ; part of it is simple metabolism , she adds			0
" your liver metabolizes @entity42 into 11 - hydroxy - @entity42 , and 11 - hydroxy - @entity42 is very psychedelic			1
" of course , for many people , getting " altered " is the whole point			0
a growing number of young people eschew joints and even @entity52 - quality buds to get high inhaling the smoke from concentrated oils with a @entity42 content of 50 % or more			1
" some people are just interested in smoking gigantic amounts of marijuana , " says @entity212			2
the trend is hard to quantify , but there are countless @entity280 videos of people smoking concentrates , and @entity140 says it 's common among young people who enter his clinic			0
" most people are going to be fine , " says @entity121 , the addiction specialist , " but there still will be that 10 % of people who are going to get as high as they possibly can			1
" rock star @entity288 : pot got me through			0

average @entity42 content has soared from less than 1 % to nearly 13 %
some experts are concerned about the long - term impact , *including* addiction
