@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 played more than 400 matches for @entity5 , @entity6 and @entity7 , winning a @entity9 title and 36 international caps			1
@entity2 's @entity11 talks to the former @entity0 star about homophobia and racism in the game			1
@entity3 , pictured here playing for @entity6 , endured homophobic abuse throughout his career due to false rumors he was gay			1
@entity11 : @entity3 , you 're happily married with two children but during your football career everyone thought you were gay and the experience was pretty miserable			1
@entity3 : the culture of football back in the 80s was very different , something i found very hard to relate to and subsequently i found myself a little bit isolated and ostracized from certain people			1
that eventually led to rumors being spread that i was gay			1
in the context of modern life that 's not defamatory but in terms of the dressing room culture that existed then -- and to an extent now -- it was very difficult for me to deal with and had the potential to damage my career			2
i think that the joke very quickly got out of hand			2
and i think where i was at fault was that i was probably a little sensitive about it , because i could actually see the potential of this sort of thing to get out of control			2
we played in a game at @entity51 and the terraces started singing something particularly defamatory about me and i remember being , you know , really , really shocked that it got to that level so quickly			2
@entity57 : and that carried on as well and the most notable incident is the one involving @entity60			0
tell me about that ? @entity62 : it all culminated in a game that we played at @entity67 against @entity68 and @entity60 , he stood in front of 40,000 people and he bent over and invited me to perform a homosexual act upon him ... that 's the politest way i can put it ! that really was the point at which it could n't get any worse			0
it was n't just people singing on the terrace , it was a colleague -- an international colleague -- humiliating you in front of all those people , an international audience			0
he will maintain to this day that it was just a laugh but that is exactly the point			0
if you look at anything like this , whether it is racism or homophobia or whatever , as if it is just a laugh that can be a very serious issue			1
i 'm all for a good laugh but when you offend someone and you are damaging relationships then it goes way beyond being a laugh and you ca n't hide behind that as an excuse			0
does homophobia in soccer exist ? have your say @entity57 : it 's thought that only one professional soccer player in the world has ever declared himself to be gay			1
that was the @entity0 @entity106 and he committed suicide a decade ago			0
@entity108 became the first gay player to be associated with the @entity110 last year , but such declarations are extremely rare			1
in many cases homosexuality remains pro sport 's last taboo			0
@entity62 : it 's such a terrible reflection on a sport that has so much positive impact across the globe that there is still this issue about gay people within the sport			1
if you look at so many other professions in terms of business and politics , across the board the gay community is represented but in football it still is n't and i find that disappointing			1
there may not be many gay players in the game but the sport should be grown up enough to be able to support those people in the football environment			1
@entity57 : @entity139 's obviously made great strides , certainly in @entity141 , in the last 10 years with regards to racism , but how much prejudice is there generally in the game ? do you think we 'll ever be free of it ? @entity62 : i think there 's always going to be an undercurrent of prejudice			1
but ultimately i think it 's important for any business really to be responsible , inclusive and representative of its employees			0
and football is in a very privileged position and can lead by example			1
and so i hope that , you know , the people in authority really make some serious attempts , i suppose to create parity between all walks of life			0
@entity57 : we 've come across a couple of black footballers who say that fans who shout racist abuse are n't really racist , they are just trying to put us off our game			2
how much do you buy into that approach ? @entity62 : well , i ca n't speak for individual black players ! but sometimes i think the perception of people it is not happening to is different to the individual			0
it used to baffle me when i first started playing that you 'd have @entity6 fans being racist to black players from the opposition but there would be three or four black players on the @entity6 's team			0
and if you spoke to them or confronted them about it , they would be like , " oh yeah , but we know them ... they are , you know , they are fine			0
" and it 's like , well how do you pick the bones out of that ? because there is just no logic			0
but then you know prejudice is built on ignorance			2
you know it really is			0
i think that sometimes you know individuals have to take responsibility for themselves and actually take a step back and look at what they are doing and not use ignorance as an excuse and say , " well , would i like to be on the receiving end of this sort of abuse ? "			2

@entity3 says an " undercurrent of prejudice " exists in football
*ex-england* star endured homophobic abuse amid false rumors he was gay
