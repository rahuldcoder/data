in a @entity1 address 50 years ago this month , president @entity0 declared " unconditional war on poverty			1
" over the next year and a half , anti-poverty warriors developed new health insurance programs for the elderly and the poor , increased @entity9 benefits and introduced food stamps and nutritional supplements for low - income pregnant women and infants			1
they established @entity16 programs for young children , @entity18 and @entity20 programs for teenagers , and work - study opportunities for college students			1
it is often forgotten that this was a bipartisan campaign			0
a @entity28 president , @entity29 , and legislators from both sides of the aisle expanded the @entity33 in the early 1970s			0
@entity29 extended the reach of the food stamp program , added an automatic cost - of - living increase to @entity9 and instituted the @entity38 system to benefit disabled adults and children			0
he even proposed a guaranteed national income though that died in the @entity43 after passing in the @entity44			0
yet in 1988 , president @entity45 declared that the war was over , and that " poverty won			1
" his claim that " government is not a solution to our problem ; government is the problem " still serves as the mantra for politicians seeking to dismantle @entity58 's social safety net			1
the truth is that the war on poverty produced some stunning successes , many of which are still felt today			1
and it likely could have produced more if politicians had n't abandoned it in the 1980s , at the very moment that @entity58 's working families were facing heightened assaults on their living standards			1
in 1963 , despite more than 15 years of prior economic expansion , the child poverty rate was almost 25 %			1
by the early 1970s it had been lowered to 15 %			0
between 1967 and 1975 , poverty among elders was cut in half			2
as of 1963 , 20 % of @entity58 living below the poverty line had never been examined by a physician ; by 1970 this was true of only 8 %			2
between 1965 and 1980 , infant mortality was halved , thanks to @entity83 and other government - subsidized health programs			1
the nutritional level of poor @entity58 improved substantially between the mid- 1960s and the late 1970s , thanks to food stamp and school lunch programs			2
children who received food stamps in the 1970s were less likely than children from similarly low - income families to develop diabetes , obesity and high blood pressure -- or to rely on welfare programs -- as adults			2
but since the late 1970s , economic insecurity has risen again , except during the brief economic boom of the late 1990s			2
the resurgence of poverty is not because government programs have " gotten in the way " but because they have not done enough to get in the way of market forces going in the wrong direction			1
historically , it has required a combination of favorable employment trends and active government intervention to lower the percentage of people in poverty and raise living standards for the working middle class			1
during the 1960s , rising real wages for low - income and high - income workers , due in part to rapid economic growth and the spread of unionization , worked in tandem with expanding government support systems to improve @entity58 ' well - being			2
after the mid- 1970s , however , the free market moved in the opposite direction			2
between 1973 and 1986 , the real median income of families headed by a person under 30 dropped by about 27 %			0
the rise of single - parent families contributed to this decline , but the poverty rate for young married couples with children also doubled between 1973 and 1988			1
unemployment spells became more common and lengthier			0
between 1979 and 1987 , the real wages of high school graduates fell by 18 % , while those of high school dropouts plummeted by 42 %			0
by the 1980s , income inequality had begun its long rise to the record - setting levels we have seen in recent years			0
yet during this period of falling real wages , politicians began winding down the war on poverty			1
in the 1980s , they shifted the tax burden from income taxes to more regressive payroll taxes , slashed investments in urban renewal , housing and transportation , and cut back on services to the poor			0
between 1970 and 1991 , the purchasing power of the typical welfare benefit decreased by more than 40 %			0
for three decades , aside from a brief respite in the 1990s , the market forces heightening financial insecurity and poverty have become even stronger , but our political leaders have failed to strengthen the social safety net enough to counteract their ill effects			1
in 1968 , the minimum wage was 55 % of the median full - time wage			0
today , a minimum - wage worker earns just 37 % of the median wage			0
the median benefit for a family of three under the @entity176 programs amounts to only about one - third the poverty level , and many families are now reaching the lifetime limits imposed on eligibility			1
still , as sociologist @entity182 shows in a study released monday by the @entity184 , government anti-poverty programs are all that stand in the way of an even worse scenario for @entity58 families			1
tax credits for low - wage jobs and dependent children -- which bring cash refunds to many poor families -- reduce child poverty by almost 7 %			2
food stamps ( now threatened with substantial cuts ) decrease poverty by an additional 3 %			2
as of 2011 , the major means - tested aid programs in the @entity58 were rescuing almost 2.4 million children from extreme poverty every month , even though they were leaving behind more than 1 million more			1
without government programs , @entity182 reports , about 15 million more people would have fallen into poverty between 2007 and 2012			1
it is a myth that government is the problem rather than part of the solution			0
in 1999 , @entity208 had an even higher child poverty rate than we do today			0
the @entity212 government responded with an ambitious anti-poverty campaign , raising the minimum wage , increasing subsidized maternity leaves and providing free preschool for all 3 - and 4 - year olds			0
within a decade , @entity208 reduced child poverty by somewhere between one - quarter and one half			0
surely @entity58 can do as well .			0

@entity223 : aid programs changed lives since @entity0 declared " war on poverty "
@entity223 : despite gains among young and elderly , politicians began cutting safety net in ' 80s
she says *mix* of good employment trends , government help reduces poverty
@entity223 : market forces boost insecurity , poverty , yet pols wo n't strengthen safety net
