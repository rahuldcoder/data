@entity0 -- what do will.i.am and @entity3 have in common ? they 're both rather partial to bionic limbs			2
in his latest music video , " @entity14 , " a human hand can be glimpsed clasping what appears to be a sophisticated robot hand stolen from the set of a high - budget sci - fi film			1
what many of the video 's 97 million ( and counting ) viewers may not realize , however , is that the appendage in question is a genuine prosthetic hand that , its makers claim , has taken us one step closer to truly simulating the real thing			1
unlike conventional prosthetics , the i - limb @entity24 boasts five individually - powered articulating digits , as well as a fully rotatable thumb and wrist , enabling the user to perform a variety of complex grips			1
" the first generation ( of prosthetics ) had what i call a pincer grip -- the fingers are reflexed so they do not change shape and they move in one plane , " explains @entity33 , the @entity34 inventor and engineer behind i - limb			1
" whereas what we produced is something that rotates at the knuckles			0
" the i - limb is the latest in " myoelectric prosthesis " -- a process that uses electrical sensors to detect tiny muscular movements in the residual limb , which are then translated by an on - board computer into natural , intuitive movement of the mechanized hand			1
in practice , this requires the wearer to learn a language of muscle movements around the wrist , which correspond to a vast array of pre-programmed hand and finger motions			1
although it requires a fair bit of concentration to begin with , @entity33 says that -- much like playing an instrument -- the mechanism is intuitive once muscle memory takes over			2
as well as the practical benefits afforded by the added range of grips , @entity33 believes the i - limb carries a significant psychological advantage because finger movements are what most people associate with the human hand			1
" when you have only one shape for the hand and it is not a particularly everyday natural one , it looks strange , " he says			0
people who 've used the i - limb " say they see the digit as what gives them the sense of having a hand back			1
" @entity91 lost his right arm in an accident at home 35 years ago			0
he was one of the first amputees to try an initial version of the i - limb back in 2007			1
" every day i 'm finding new things with it -- it 's absolutely amazing ... it 's the hand i thought i 'd never have again , " he said			0
but of course , although it can rotate 360 degrees , the i - limb is still far from measuring up to the real thing			2
" we ca n't approach the subtlety of skin , sensation of temperature , touching things yet , " admits @entity33			0
" but we 've broken through the barrier of making a hand that looks like a medical device			0
" as things stand , the i - limb is also prohibitively expensive			2
including fitting and training , a hand costs in the region of $ 100,000			0
perhaps in part because of this , most of the 4,000 or so i - limb users in the world are war veterans from @entity124 and @entity125			1
@entity33 notes , however , that the potential market is huge : there are presently an estimated two million upper limb amputees across the globe			0
@entity130 , the company that @entity33 founded to produce the i - limb , is looking to take its share			2
@entity33 , who left the company in 2009 , says sales are accelerating and 2012 saw turnover reach over $ 16 million			0
for the @entity136 - based engineer , who abandoned his career in the defense industry to dedicate himself to the study of prosthetics , the i - limb is much more than a business			2
" i have seen hundreds of people ... i have seen the father that says ' thank you ' on behalf of his son , " @entity33 says , wiping a tear from his eye			0
" that means an awful lot because you do n't , as an engineer , get many moments where you articulate human emotions about these things			0

the @entity156 is the first prosthetic hand that has five individually - powered articulating digits
wearers control hand via an electrical sensor that detects muscle movements in residual limb
most of the 4,000 *+* i - limbs in operation have been fitted to veterans from wars in @entity124 and @entity125
