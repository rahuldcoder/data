even two - tonne , spike - horned , armor - skinned rhinos need a helping hand sometimes			1
fortunately , they can rely on one committed defender : eight - year - old @entity5			1
" when i heard that rhinos were being killed , they were my favorite animals and i wanted to start this , " says the elementary school pupil			1
her campaign , @entity10 the @entity11 , has raised thousands of dollars to protect her favorite animal -- @entity14 's poacher - threatened rhinoceros -- and fund an innovative scheme aimed at tracking the hunters who would do them harm			1
@entity21 , @entity19 one - and - only " @entity20 , " sells homemade chocolates for 10 rand ( $ 0.85 ) at her school			1
so far , she has raised over $ 23,000 through a combination of chocolate sales and donations from the growing number of people -- young and old -- who have filled halls to hear the young campaigner speak			1
picture perfect it all started in may 2013 when @entity21 -- then aged six - and - a - half -- came home from school and drew a picture : the same crayon image of long - horned rhino beneath a rainbow that is now stamped on her campaign 's sweets and chocolate			1
her father , @entity21 , says she 'd been taught about the plight of endangered animals , and burst out crying when she heard rhinos were being butchered by poachers			1
at home that night , the family resolved to do something to help , settling on the chocolates as a good place to start			0
her father was her first customer			0
" originally she just wanted to do something to help , " he says			0
" the idea was to sell to anybody that would buy , so we started off by selling to friends and family , grannies and grandpas and people at church			2
" for over a year , she has been selling chocolates every friday at her supportive @entity69 primary school -- and has now grown her stall with rhino - branded lollipops , stickers , biltong , and a range of knitted rhino toys created by a well - wisher who had heard about her fundraising efforts			1
@entity21 knows her most enthusiastic customers : singling out one particularly generous schoolmistress , teacher @entity80 , and an exceptionally sweet - toothed class of her schoolmates as her biggest supporters			0
dogs take bite out of poaching " what @entity5 wanted to do was to give the money toward buying trained sniffer dogs to go into the @entity90 , " says dad @entity21			1
there , across an area the size of @entity93 , park rangers fight a desperate battle with poachers to prevent the extinction of the rhinoceros , whose horn is prized for its supposed value in traditional @entity102 medicines			0
highly trained canines are a new addition to the park , first arriving in 2012			0
" if they find a rhino lying dead , they can sniff out where the poachers are , " explains @entity5 -- allowing rangers track poachers , just as the poachers themselves stalk prey			0
dogs will soon patrol the park 's entrance points , too , detecting weapons that poachers attempt to smuggle in , and contraband -- including rhinoceros horn -- being transported out			2
at @entity122 , @entity14 's largest wildlife reserve , park authorities report an increase in contact with suspected poachers , with rangers claiming before @entity128 that 164 had been arrested in the park over the year			2
with each dog 's purchase , training and kennel costs running to over $ 8,000 per dog , they are n't cheap , but the young " rhino champion " can now proudly boast to have already added two new k - 9 enforcers to the battle			2
@entity11 spotting but why rhinos ? " they 're nice and , with their big - horns , they look beautiful , and i like looking for them in the wild , " explains @entity21			2
before starting @entity146 the @entity11 , the @entity69 resident had never seen a rhinoceros in its natural habitat			2
now , she 's been to @entity122 several times , she says -- on invitation to meet the park 's other @entity152 , on a few occasions , and recently visiting two sniffer dogs in training last summer			1
she eagerly snaps photographs of every animal she sees in the park but rhinos hold a special place : " it 's really nice because i know i 'm doing something , " she says			0
@entity21 says she keeps count of each of the rhino she sees -- and is up to " 130 - something , " so far			0
@entity21 is keen to talk to others about her experiences with rhinos , standing up in front of 700 students at a school in december , and nearly 300 adults at a development conference earlier that year			1
she says it 's just as easy to talk to grown - ups as kids -- as long as her father is by her side			0
the elder @entity21 says he was n't involved in conservation before @entity5 started her campaign , and that the whole family has caught the young activist 's enthusiasm			2
the ambition now is for @entity5 to talk at more corporate events , including business golf days where she has found success encouraging businesspeople to give to the cause			0
" the bottom line is we need to raise more money , " says @entity21 , " and we need to sell more chocolates			0

eight - year - old @entity203 has started her own campaign to protect rhinos from poaching
the @entity69 primary school pupil has raised over $ 23,000
her money will train sniffer dogs as part of a new campaign to stop poachers
