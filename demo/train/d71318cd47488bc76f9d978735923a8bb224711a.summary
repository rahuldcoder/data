-- col. @entity1 stood tall and proud and often ventured " outside the wire " with his soldiers in @entity3			1
under the sizzle of the @entity8 sun , i watched him meticulously pin medals on their uniforms			1
when he retired in 2011 , he walked the @entity11 to clear his head and began a tough @entity13 in security studies at @entity15			0
a stellar military career in hand , @entity1 had his life on track			1
he harbored an emptiness within , the kind that rushes in after a hard - fought , 15 - month combat tour ends			0
he felt responsible , still , for the lives he touched at war			0
one of them was a girl named @entity28			1
he 'd wondered all these years what had happened to the child his soldiers helped save			1
he sought out people who might have an answer -- @entity35 buddies , journalists and an @entity8 sheikh he 'd befriended in the neighborhood where @entity28 used to live			1
he finally connected with her wednesday through a package from @entity41			1
the goods were donated , but they were delivered to @entity28 's home in @entity3 largely because of @entity1 's efforts			1
viewers write in to help @entity8 's ' miracle baby ' for @entity28 , crippled by spina bifida , it 's a gift that is sure to bring relief			1
she received a new wheelchair and other things to help her cope with her disability			0
for @entity1 , it means fulfillment , closure -- if there is such a thing -- to one part of his life at war			1
since his encounter with @entity28 almost seven years ago , @entity1 's uneasiness had festered			1
then in march , on the 10th anniversary of the start of the @entity65 , @entity1 saw a @entity0 story about @entity28			1
i had journeyed back to @entity3 to find her			0
he watched the accompanying video , incredulous that the 3 - month - old baby he knew was now 7 years old			0
he was relieved , excited even , that she was alive			0
he could not get the headline -- " the unfinished miracle of @entity28 " -- out of his head			1
the word " unfinished " gnawed at his soul ; that sense of responsibility hung heavy			0
" i hope that you might consider keeping me informed of anything you learn from here forward , " @entity1 told me in a message after finding me on @entity81			1
" it would help me help my soldiers keep knowing that if they did any one thing right in @entity8 , it was saving a little girl 's life			1
" i personally struggle with what i can do as an individual and will offer my services -- as a champion , with money , as a connector -- in any way within my means			0
" i was embedded with @entity1 's soldiers when they discovered @entity28 , then only 3 months old , during a raid on her family 's house in the city of @entity104 a few days before christmas 2005			1
she 'd been born with a severe form of spina bifida , a spinal cord defect that was certain to kill her			0
the medical treatment she needed was not available in war - ravaged @entity8			1
the soldiers wanted to shuttle her out of @entity3 for the critical care she needed			0
when i spoke with @entity1 a few days ago , he recalled how he had stood at brigade headquarters at @entity116 and made his case for why the @entity35 should help send an @entity8 baby to @entity41			1
@entity8 , 10 years later : a people in need one child matters , he said			1
he spoke on behalf of his soldiers			0
they saw @entity28 as a tangible act of goodness amid the chaos of @entity8			1
@entity28 boarded a c - 130 transport plane with her grandmother and father and came to @entity131 , where doctors successfully operated on her			1
she became known to the world as @entity28			2
her smile enthralled everyone who saw her on television screens and newspaper pages			0
she was labeled @entity8 's miracle baby			1
after six months , in june 2006 , she was returned to @entity3 , where life is not easy for anyone and even less so for a poor family caring for a child with special needs			0
@entity144 saved her life , but @entity28 was paralyzed from the waist down			2
she could n't walk or go to the bathroom by herself			0
doctors said it would always be that way			0
her family also paid a price for their association with @entity41 -- @entity28 's father says he was abducted by men linked to @entity155			1
they accused him of spying and demanded a stiff ransom			0
i 'd not seen @entity28 since 2008			2
in february , i returned to @entity3 to find her			0
she was no longer the smiling , chubby baby i remembered			0
she 'd grown into a frail girl who rarely smiled			0
her family feared for her future			0
they did not have the means to have her examined by specialists			0
they were running out of medical supplies such as catheters			0
@entity28 was susceptible to urinary tract infections and often complained of headaches -- doctors had inserted a shunt to drain the fluid that collected in her brain			2
what would happen to her as she grew older ? no one would marry a disabled woman in @entity8 , her aunts said			1
@entity28 's grandfather begged for help			2
she might have had a semblance of a normal life here in the @entity41 , where she could have had access to advanced urological care and the comforts of life			2
but in @entity3 , long after the @entity41 left @entity8 , @entity28 was struggling to survive , to even feel joy			1
readers responded to @entity28 's story and sent in donations to @entity193 , an @entity131 - based @entity194 charity that sponsored @entity28 's stay in the @entity41 in 2006			1
with some of the money , @entity193 purchased a two - year supply of catheters , laxatives , books , crayons , pencils , teddy bears , toothpaste and a pediatric wheelchair with gel pads , foot rests and adjustable handles			0
for @entity28 , it would be like upgrading to a @entity210 after years of driving a rundown @entity211			2
@entity8 newsmakers : where are they now ? but the organization had no contacts in @entity3			2
how would it get all the stuff there ? that 's when @entity1 stepped in			2
as a retired @entity35 officer , he had connections with people in the @entity41 embassy			2
within days @entity224 's @entity223 and the @entity225 of @entity226 were involved			0
@entity0 staffers , who knew where @entity28 lived , helped take the shipment wednesday to the family home in southwest @entity3			1
@entity28 's grandfather , @entity231 , was thankful for the wheelchair and supplies			2
among those he named was " mr. @entity1			2
" in the context of @entity8 , the gift for @entity28 is not big			1
it is but a blip in a story of war that is overflowing with sorrow and loss			0
but for @entity28 's family , it was a sign that those who had given her a chance at life had not forgotten her			2
" we know now that you are not going to leave us , " @entity231 said			0
no one ever doubted that saving @entity28 's life was a good thing			2
but was there any thought put into what would happen afterward to her and the family ? should she have been brought to @entity41 and then returned to a place like @entity8 , where medical care was next to nothing and where her family paid a price for accepting help from @entity41 ? i asked @entity1 the same question i had asked his soldiers who were involved with @entity28 's journey to @entity41			1
" was it the right thing to do ? " " unequivocally , yes , " he replied			0
he and his soldiers did n't just save a life that day			2
they 'd saved a life that continued			0
" you know that scene in ' @entity275 ' that is cut across the beginning and the end of the movie ? " @entity1 asked me a few days ago on the phone			2
i know the one , i tell him			0
it 's the scene when an aging @entity283 kneels down at the grave of his captain , who he 'd served alongside in the thick of battle			0
before he died , the captain had said to @entity283 : " earn this			0
" reflecting on those words and the price that was paid for having saved his life , @entity283 turns to his wife of many decades and asks : " am i a good man ? " it 's a scene that gets @entity1 every time			0
" i think we all want to be told that we were ' good men , ' despite our personal flaws , foibles , failures , missteps and the overall funk of what that conflict in @entity8 felt like , looked like and came across like to both us and the citizens back home , " @entity1 told me			1
" perhaps the @entity28 story shines that light on a time when we were good men and earned our nation 's respect whether they were looking or not ... whether they knew it or not , and it gives us some comfort amongst the shades of gray we experienced there			1
" for @entity1 and his soldiers who plucked @entity28 from her home all those years ago , the gift delivered this week represented a lingering desire to do something right in the end			1
so that the story of @entity8 's miracle baby did not remain " unfinished			1
" follow @entity0 's @entity326 on @entity327			0
