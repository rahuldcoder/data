the 110th birthday of former @entity3 leader @entity2 was celebrated on august 22 with an exhibition , a television biopic , and a series of national events			1
the " paramount leader " ruled for more than a decade , kick - starting @entity3 's market economic reform			1
all these events have prompted much talk not just on @entity2 but also on @entity3 president @entity12			1
straws in the wind here hint that @entity3 is again entering an era of strongman rule			2
less than two years after @entity12 took over the top @entity20 post , @entity12 's leading position is looking virtually unassailable			1
he now holds the top posts in the party , state and the military			0
recently , he has cleverly maneuvered to put himself at the head of two new supra - ministerial bodies			0
the " central leading group on national security " gives him the final say on diplomatic , military , security , police and intelligence institutions			0
the other leading group on " deepening of economic reform " gives him oversight on economic affairs , clipping the power of premier @entity39 , @entity3 's no. 2 leader and the de facto coo of the economy			1
this , @entity3 analysts say , signifies that @entity12 has become the most powerful @entity3 leader since the death of @entity2 in 1997			1
@entity46 or @entity2 ? @entity12 's shrewd moves makes @entity3 watchers wonder : is he mimicking @entity46 , who wielded absolute power during his decades - long rule ? is he building a cult of personality that befits an omnipotent modern - day emperor ? to be sure , @entity12 does not approve of totally repudiating @entity46			1
" to completely negate @entity46 would lead to the demise of the @entity20 of @entity3 and to great chaos in @entity3 , " @entity12 said early last year			1
he rejected " historical nihilism , " instead advocating " not being negative about the 30 years before @entity2 's economic reform			1
" still , some @entity3 experts say @entity12 is not following @entity46 's policies			1
" if you look at what he does and how he does it , i do n't see much @entity68 , " said @entity60 , a retired @entity61 professor and author of the book " @entity2 and the @entity64			2
" " i see much more of @entity2			2
" @entity69 recalled how @entity12 chose @entity70 as the site of his first " inspection tour " as president			2
the @entity74 is where @entity2 experimented with his market - reform in the early 1980s			2
@entity12 referred to that in his speech commemorating the 110th anniversary of the birth of the @entity2			1
" it was a very sentimental thing , " @entity69 noted			0
" i think the effect of the speech and what @entity12 was trying to say is that ' ok , @entity2 was a bold leader who tried to make changes			1
i 'm going to make some changes too			0
' " like @entity2 , @entity69 explained , @entity12 believes that the country must be strong			1
" but he felt in the end that only if the country had enough internal stability could you make changes , " the @entity61 professor said			0
" and he was quite cautious about releasing and allowing more freedom until the conditions were met			0
it looks to me that @entity12 was very much following it			2
" keeping friends close the @entity61 historian has not seen much sign that @entity12 wants to be more democratic			2
" he has been very tough on corruption , and the way i see it now he 's beginning to talk about the law , the legal reform , " he said			0
early this month the @entity20 announced that @entity105 , the former public security minister and member of @entity3 's @entity107 , would be investigated " on suspicion of grave violations of discipline			2
" this is by far the biggest step @entity12 has taken in his anti-corruption campaign , confirming his pledge to take on the " tigers " ( top officials ) as well as " flies " ( minor violators )			2
like @entity2 , @entity69 added , @entity12 wants to centralize things in his own hands			1
" he wants to be a strong leader			0
he wants to make bold decisions			0
and he wants to make it very clear that he 's in charge			0
" @entity12 is in a hurry to take charge			0
since he took over top posts , he has been moving allies into key party , government and military positions			0
" it took ( former president ) @entity136 10 years to promote his trusted commanders to top military posts , " says one @entity3 source who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the topic			0
" it took ( @entity12 's predecessor ) @entity141 four to do the same			1
@entity12 is doing it in two years			0
" @entity144 , an army general and , like @entity12 , a well - connected " princeling " ( he is the son of the late @entity3 president @entity146 ) , is poised to be elevated into the military commission , the source said			1
current @entity149 party chief @entity148 is also expected to move to @entity150 to join the leading group on @entity152			0
top - level reshuffles are expected to be finalized during a policy meeting , called a " plenum , " of the nearly 400 members of the @entity20 's elite scheduled in october			0
after this round of changes , the @entity3 source said , " about 70 % of top leaders in the provinces and major cities and some ministries will have been replaced or reshuffled			0
it 's the second stage of @entity12 's plan to put in his people			1
" " historic mission " supporters of @entity12 's attempts to accumulate power say he needs to do so to deal with a host of pressing challenges			1
i asked whether this makes him a dictator in the making			0
" every leader in the world does this , " the source said			0
" if @entity183 ( @entity182 ) becomes the next @entity185 president , she will also do the same -- put people you trust in critical posts			0
" leading @entity3 's transition , he said , is an extraordinarily difficult job			2
@entity12 's admirers say he a pragmatist who is more goal - oriented than ideologically driven			1
" it 's not really a question of whether @entity12 is a conservative or a reformist , " said the @entity3 source			1
" he is poised to make big changes because he truly believes he has a historic mission to achieve his @entity200			1
he wants to keep the @entity20 in power but he also wants to push @entity3 to the next level			0
" how @entity12 will achieve his goals remains undefined , but one thing is clear : @entity12 does not welcome unsolicited advice			2
earlier , he had been heard saying , off - the - cuff : " westerners with full stomachs should not be lecturing @entity3			0
" said in the fashion of @entity46 and @entity2 .			1

@entity12 has become the most powerful @entity3 leader since the death of @entity2 in 1997
@entity3 watchers compare @entity12 's ruling *strategy* to those of @entity46 and @entity2
@entity3 *insider* : " @entity12 truly believes he has a historic mission to achieve the @entity200 "
