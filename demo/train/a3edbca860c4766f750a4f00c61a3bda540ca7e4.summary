after the @entity2 attacks by @entity5 - aligned @entity4 terrorists , much of the world -- even some muslim world leaders -- seems united in the defense of free speech and freedom of religion			1
and at the @entity11 recently , @entity10 declared its aversion to attacks on liberty , mocking @entity16 's @entity15 for trying to shut down the movie " @entity18 " and announcing its united front with @entity20 against terrorism			1
" @entity23 , " said @entity22			2
" together we will stand united against anyone who would oppress free speech , " said @entity25 president @entity24			2
@entity29 talked about the millions who marched for unity in @entity2 : " they marched in support of the idea that we will not walk in fear			2
we wo n't do it			2
" the tech world , too , has pledged its support of life and liberty in the wake of the @entity44 hack and @entity2 attacks			2
@entity47 ceo @entity46 called for a rejection of " extremists trying to silence the voices and opinions of everyone else around the world			2
" @entity54 featured a black ribbon on its homepage and @entity57 put a banner with the words " @entity60 " on its @entity20 website			2
this is all very fine and good , of course			0
the horrific slayings of @entity20 police officers , @entity20 cartoonists and four @entity66 at a grocery store should be the kind of shock to the system that brings even the most disparate of groups together , and maybe even jolts them out of the false sense of security that @entity5 's " leadership ranks have been decimated " or that @entity4 extremism can be thwarted by efforts at multiculturalism			0
many are united in horror , but one only needs to look back at some recent examples of other horrifying atrocities to know that mere symbolism and solidarity -- what i call the weapons of " soft outrage " -- will not be enough to stamp out terrorism in @entity90 or anywhere else			1
it 's been eight months since @entity94 militants kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls in @entity96 , @entity97 , and they are still missing , despite @entity100 first lady @entity99 's best efforts at soft outrage , joining a @entity102 campaign to # @entity103			1
even though it went viral , and everyone from @entity106 to @entity108 prime minister @entity107 chimed in , hashtag activism has n't proven very effective in the face of violent @entity4 extremism			1
last week reports that a shudder - inducing 2,000 people were killed in @entity97 once again shocked @entity113 audiences , who then learned that most of the victims were reportedly children , women and the elderly			1
the @entity118 estimates that @entity94 now controls 70 % of @entity97 's @entity119			0
in another corner of @entity122 , @entity120 remains a ghastly site of untold violence and genocide that has spanned 10 years , wiped out hundreds of thousands and displaced millions			1
last october there was reportedly a mass rape in the village of @entity130 , @entity131 , as tribal fighting rages on			0
but this weekend the @entity11 honored @entity29 with a lifetime achievement award , for his work in film but also for raising awareness of @entity120 's plight			1
what has all that awareness accomplished ? not much , as the @entity140 recently learned			0
it asked people who have lived and worked in the region " what happened to @entity120 after @entity29 came to town ? " as one resident put it : " @entity29 might be doing something fantastic -- tracking the movements of @entity131 troops and militias -- but for me as a person living in @entity120 , in touch with what is happening on daily basis , i do n't see that it has halted , or even reduced , the genocide			1
the killing , displacement , sexual assaults and rape never stopped			0
" while awareness and solidarity are n't unimportant , " soft outrage " is useless in stopping terrorism and genocide			1
these things often require force , the kind of intervention that tends to make soft outragers uncomfortable			1
if @entity29 , for example , truly cares about the people of @entity120 ( and i 'm certain that he does ) , i would hope he accepts that " awareness " alone will not end the genocide there -- only force will			1
@entity180 diplomacy is n't an actual solution to a terrifying , real problem			0
but military intervention to " bring back our girls " or stop the horrific atrocities in @entity97 could well be			0
@entity90 must accept that unity marches and inclusion rhetoric wo n't protect freedom of speech or religion against extremists determined to attack them			0
@entity20 has recommitted to attacking @entity192 in @entity193 along with the @entity100 , but will it join in strikes against @entity192 in @entity195 , or @entity5 terrorists in the @entity197 and elsewhere ? @entity198 must accept that @entity47 posts and website banners wo n't prevent terrorists -- whether @entity192 or actors like @entity15 -- from attacking @entity113 values and @entity113 infrastructure			1
will @entity47 , @entity54 and @entity57 support the necessary investments in our national defense that will help better protect our values and our companies ? maybe you do n't believe that the @entity100 should involve itself politically or militarily in these conflicts around the world			0
that 's a reasonable position , even if i disagree with it			0
but let 's not kid ourselves into thinking our soft outrage is either effective or noble			1
it 's lovely to see all these folks " stand with @entity20			0
" but standing is n't doing , and the hard truth is that symbolism is no match for the fanatics who want us exterminated			0
are they ready to back up their rhetoric with action ?			0

@entity233 : at @entity11 and beyond , @entity10 denounces terrorism , genocide
she says @entity99 , @entity106 think hashtag activism helps , but it does nothing
@entity242 : left - *leaners* should skip " soft outrage " -- force is more likely to work
