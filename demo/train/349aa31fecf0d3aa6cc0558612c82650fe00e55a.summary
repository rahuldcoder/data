-- " my hands are tied			2
" those are words that @entity4 never wants to hear again			1
the last time he heard them : an immigration judge was ordering him out of the country			2
in june 2012 , just days shy of his 41st birthday , the @entity10 veteran was deported to @entity12 , a country he had n't lived in since he was 17			1
" it 's kind of stressful , " @entity4 said in a phone interview , but then corrected himself			1
" not kind of -- very stressful			2
" @entity4 is one of more than 23,000 permanent legal residents who were deported in 2012			1
the number of veterans is unknown because the @entity18 says it does n't keep those records and neither do other government agencies			2
but the club is not an exclusive one			2
for instance , the group banished veterans , founded by a deported vet @entity26 , is in touch with veterans in 19 countries			2
he said he knows of six living in @entity12 from the @entity30 , the @entity31 and the @entity32			2
and he estimates that as many as 30,000 former service members have been deported since 1996 , while other groups put the total at several thousand			2
although thousands of former service members and their families are believed to be impacted , the matter is virtually invisible even with immigration reform a hot - button issue in @entity41 and veterans concerns at large receiving attention as the nation steps away from 13 years of war			2
as president @entity47 reviews related policies following heavy criticism for deporting more immigrants than any previous administration , immigration groups ask that greater discretion be given for those in the country legally -- and that military service be a priority , especially with tens of thousands of men and women leaving the post-war military and transitioning back into civilian life			1
@entity47 said he ca n't stop deportations , but maybe he can served in @entity31 and that brings us back to the first time @entity4 heard the words , " my hands are tied			1
" after graduating from high school in @entity68 , @entity4 did a four - year stint as a communications specialist in the @entity10 , serving in the first @entity31 and traveling around the world -- to @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			1
he was one of thousands serving in the early 1990s who were n't @entity78 citizens			2
currently 30,000 non-citizens serve in the military , a small fraction of the total number of active duty forces			0
after being honorably discharged , @entity4 ran into trouble			1
as he tells it , an acquaintance from the military asked him if he could mail a package to @entity4 's @entity90 house			1
when the package arrived , @entity4 offered to meet his friend to hand it over			1
before he got more than a mile , police surrounded his car , confiscated the box and told him it was filled with marijuana and that they had been tracking it			0
@entity4 said he had no idea of the package 's contents			1
he never thought to ask what was being delivered			0
and he never saw his acquaintance again			0
" i did n't want to call my mother , " @entity4 said , recalling the incident and insisting that he 'd never been in trouble with the law			1
" i 'm not doing drugs ; there 's no way i can go to jail			0
" jail time two years later , in 1997 , he was given a court date			0
his lawyer advised him to plead guilty to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute to avoid risk of losing his trial and receiving a harsher sentence			0
despite having an otherwise spotless record , the sentencing judge told him that his guilty plea meant he had to sentence him to 10 years in prison under mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines			0
" my hands are tied , " @entity4 said the judge told him			1
@entity4 's advocates and the @entity18 confirmed the main details of his case			1
he ended up serving a hair more than 15 months , but little did he know at the time that his sentence was long enough to trigger more problems down the road			0
after prison , he moved home to be with his wife and 1 - year - old daughter			2
he started his own trucking company , bought a house , stayed out of trouble and thought things were going well			0
so in 2005 , he decided to upgrade his legal status and apply for citizenship			2
he told the immigration case worker that he had been charged with a felony			0
she said she would be back in touch			0
five years later , they said they could n't find any record of his felony , so he provided them with the court disposition			0
in early 2010 , he was told the felony barred him from obtaining his citizenship			0
" i was very disappointed , " @entity4 said			1
should @entity47 use the power of his pen to turn the tide on immigration reform ? then it got worse			1
five months later , in june 2010 , immigration enforcement officials showed up at his home , telling him that he was being detained because of his felony			0
" if i never applied for citizenship it would have been ok , " @entity4 said			1
law made it easier in 1996 , @entity167 passed the @entity168 , a law that made it easier to deport people who were in the country legally			0
legal permanent residents , like @entity4 , can be deported if they commit a class of crimes only applicable to immigrants called " aggravated felonies " or " crimes of moral turpitude			1
" they are crimes that include murder and weapons trafficking but also drug possession and theft -- any crime that constitutes a sentence of one year or more			2
@entity187 , executive director for policy and government affairs for @entity190 said veterans facing deportation contact his organization for help			0
he said he draws a line at helping violent criminals but " to deport an individual after they put their lives on the line , 98 percent of the @entity78 people have not done that			0
" while the @entity47 administration has deported more illegal immigrants than its predecessors , it began deporting fewer legal immigrants in 2010 , reaching a 10 - year low in 2013 of 20,153 legal resident deportees , according to homeland security data			1
@entity211 , a spokeswoman with @entity212 , said she could n't " speculate " on the reason why the deportation of legal residents have decreased			1
more discretion @entity217 , former deputy general counsel of the @entity18 in 2009 and 2010 , suggested that immigration agents were given more discretion on which people to take into deportation proceedings			0
he pointed to a 2011 memo by @entity212 director @entity223 that outlined what considerations to make when determining what legal residents to take into detention , including military service , community ties , family members who are citizens and cooperation with immigration enforcement -- all things that @entity4 had going for him			1
" @entity212 respects the service and sacrifice of those in military service , and is very deliberate in its review of cases involving veterans , " @entity236 said			0
" @entity212 exercises prosecutorial discretion for members of the armed forces who have honorably served our country on a case - by - case basis when appropriate			0
" but the policy change came too late for @entity4			1
he had already been in custody for a year and while immigration agents now have some discretion , immigration judges still have none and can not take any of a person 's positive attributes into consideration before ordering deportation for people who have committed " aggravated felonies " -- no matter how long ago the crime was committed			2
more susceptible @entity263 , a @entity264 law professor who represents veterans going through deportation proceedings , said veterans , especially those returning from war , can be even more susceptible to deportable offenses			0
" anecdotal evidence leads me to suspect that veterans have been deported more frequently and for less serious offenses , " @entity263 said , hearing about the first veteran sent through deportation proceedings in 1998			1
as the two - year anniversary of his deportation approaches , @entity4 's sister said his deportation date is etched into her memory			1
i will never forget it , " @entity281 said			0
" it 's the same day i was coming back from my honeymoon in the @entity285			0
" @entity4 said he ca n't find work or even leave his house very often due to the societal stigma in @entity12 of being a deportee			1
he said his family in the @entity78 has broken apart			0
his teen age son has gotten into trouble with the law and his teen age daughter is severely depressed			0
" sometimes it 's hard for me to talk to ( my daughter ) because all i want to do is cry , " he said			0
" everything just went downhill since i left them			0
" still trying his sister and mother are working to bring @entity4 back home			1
they have met with members of the @entity47 administration and with lawmakers , including sen. @entity307 of @entity308 , who is interested in his case			1
@entity310 with the @entity311 , who is currently representing @entity4 , said @entity47 should address the issue of tens of thousands of legal permanent residents being deported each year			1
" the @entity47 administration has the power to exercise discretion and provide deportation relief in cases like @entity4 's , and should do so without any further delay , " she said			1
" this is worse than death in some ways , " @entity4 said			2
" it 's like being buried alive			0
" @entity323 : @entity324 needs to ' get beyond deportation '			0
