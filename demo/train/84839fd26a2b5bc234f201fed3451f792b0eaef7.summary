@entity1 's highest court has rejected a challenge from the @entity3 seeking to overturn a ban on non-muslims using the word " @entity7 " to refer to @entity8			1
but after the @entity10 announced its verdict on monday , the government released a statement saying that the ruling would only apply to the @entity3 's newspaper , which has been at the center of the court battle since @entity1 authorities ordered the publication to cease using the @entity20 word in 2007			1
@entity1 @entity23 will still be able to use the word " @entity7 " in church , the government 's statement said			1
" @entity1 is a multi-faith country and it is important that we manage our differences peacefully , in accordance with the rule of law and through dialogue , mutual respect and compromise , " the statement said			0
confusion the conflicting interpretations of the ban have only added confusion to a debate that has inflamed religious tensions in the @entity40 - majority country in recent years			1
the editor of the the newspaper , the @entity42 , said it remains unclear what the implications of the court 's verdict would be for the @entity49 community			2
" we are in limbo , " father @entity50 told @entity51			0
but the chairman of the @entity55 , reverend @entity56 , said in a statement that @entity23 will continue to use the word " @entity7 " in bibles and during church gatherings			1
the dispute began in 2007 when the @entity1 @entity62 , which grants publishing licenses , threatened to withdraw the @entity42 's permit for using the @entity20 word in its @entity67 edition , on the grounds of national security and public order			1
@entity1 authorities say @entity73 literature that contains the word could confuse @entity40 and cause them to convert away from @entity75 , which is a crime in many parts of the country			1
@entity49 leaders argue that the word " @entity7 " predates @entity75 , and has long been used in @entity67 - language bibles and other texts to refer to @entity8			1
anti-christian violence the dispute has sparked violence in recent years against @entity1 's @entity49 community , which accounts for around 9 % of the country 's population of 29 million , while more than 60 % are @entity40			1
a series of fire bomb attacks were carried out on places of worship after a court ruled in 2009 that the @entity3 had a constitutional right to refer to @entity8 as " @entity7 " in the @entity42			1
but an appeals court reinstated the ban in october 2013			0
three months later , arsonists set fire to a church in @entity99 , and @entity75 authorities confiscated hundreds of bibles containing the word " @entity7 " from a @entity49 organization in the state of @entity104			2
on monday , a panel of judges at the @entity10 in @entity107 ruled 4 to 3 that the word was not an integral part of the @entity49 faith , upholding the decision of the appeals court			0
outside the building , hundreds of @entity40 activists celebrated the verdict , shouting " @entity116 " ( @entity8 is great )			1
" we thank @entity7 because the court 's decision has favored us this time			2
we hope that this is no longer an issue in the peninsular , which does not allow others ( to use ) the term , " the head of @entity121 , a conservative @entity40 rights group , told reporters			0
father @entity50 from the @entity42 said the @entity3 was looking into ways to challenge the ban			2
" we need to fight this case to end , because we have to fight for justice when justice is derided or denied , " he said			0
" we have a moral obligation to champion the cause of minorities			0
we have a responsibility to uphold religious freedom			0
" politics it 's likely that the ban is politically motivated , according to @entity143 , a political scientist with the @entity145 's @entity144			0
@entity1 's prime minister @entity146 is a reformist to some extent , says case , but his party failed to win a majority in the last election and he needs to recapture the support of the country 's ethnic @entity67 , and mostly @entity40 , community			1
however , it 's too soon to tell how the @entity1 government will implement the ban in practice , he says			1
" this is the kind of ambiguity you would expect , because it 's a very complex and tense set of circumstances			0
you might have the judiciary saying one thing , the cabinet saying another -- meanwhile pressure is mounting from the many @entity40 groups involved who bring tremendous mass - based support , and on the other side from @entity49 groups			0
" the ruling may lead to further attacks on churches , @entity143 warned			0
" we do know that @entity1 has become more and more polarized in recent years on ethnic , and increasingly religious , grounds -- and that 's becoming more and more severe			0
" but while the latest court ruling is distressing , @entity143 says verbal threats against religious groups in @entity1 seldom translate into the kind of violence seen in neighboring countries , like @entity187			2
" we do n't see extrajudicial killings , religious - inspired violence and abductions , and that distinguishes @entity1 in the region			0
" in 2013 : christian churches in @entity195 vow to continue using the word ' @entity7 ' @entity198 @entity49 woman rearrested , legal team says			2

@entity1 's top court dismisses bid to overturn ban on @entity23 using @entity20 word for @entity8
confusion over ruling as government says ban only applies to @entity3 's newspaper
@entity40 say use of " @entity7 " in @entity73 texts could cause @entity40 to convert
@entity3 says it will continue to fight the ruling
