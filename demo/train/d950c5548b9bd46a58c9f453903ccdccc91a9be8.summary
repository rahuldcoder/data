so capable of wielding a sword in @entity3 , destroying zombies in @entity5 , and seducing leading ladies with just the tilt of a cowboy hat in @entity9			0
" he 's a real man 's man , " gushed @entity10 and mother of his six - children , @entity13			0
but that alone is not what makes him such an important role model for men today , says one of @entity23 's most distinguished feminists and international affairs professors , @entity25			1
it 's his ability to share breadwinning and caregiving with his partner			1
which has a lot more to do with empowering women than you might think			0
" think of @entity1 in @entity3 , he 's a real guy , no question , " said 55 - year - old @entity25 , president of the @entity35 , and former @entity36 at the @entity37			1
" but he 's also become a posterchild for engaged fatherhood			1
" " when @entity13 is on location , he 's there with their six children , and when @entity1 is on location , she 's there with the kids			1
so that 's really sending a very different signal about what an icon , a movie star , and definitely a leading man is			0
" of course , as @entity25 admits with a chuckle : " we never see the probably 15 people on the ' childcare train ' that i 'm sure they drag along with them			2
" but @entity59 -- often seen splashed across celebrity magazines with his brood in tow -- nonetheless represents a shift in how society views men , she says			0
and that has big consequences for women			0
" why women still ca n't have it all " around a year - and - a - half ago , @entity25 was a hugely successful , though relatively unknown academic			1
then , in the summer of 2012 , she wrote an article in the @entity73 , " why women still ca n't have it all , " and it became the most read in the publication 's history , with over 224,000 people sharing it on @entity78			1
why the huge response ? in the article , @entity25 spoke of her decision to leave her job as the first female director of policy planning at the @entity37 , after two years working under @entity84			2
commuting from @entity86 to @entity87 each week , @entity25 was getting up at 4.20am on mondays and returned on friday evenings -- all while her teenage son was having problems at school			2
and so she left her government job and returned to teaching at @entity92 : " because of my desire to be with my family and my conclusion that juggling high - level government work with the needs of two teenage boys was not possible			2
" beyond the women 's movement now @entity25 is extending the debate on gender equality -- and focusing on men -- in this interview with @entity0			1
" the conversation has been tilted too far in the direction of women 's issues , women 's problems , missing women in the workforce			1
that is a huge issue			0
and it 's appropriate that 60 years after the ' @entity116 ' was published , that we should be asking these questions			0
but i really see this issue as a much broader social issue -- as an issue of breadwinning on the one hand , and caregiving on the other			2
" " men 's choices are actually still much more restricted than women 's			1
because although women no longer have to just be in the home , men are still pretty uniformly socialised to believe their place is in the office			2
and if we really want equality between men and women , we ca n't just measure it in terms of how well women succeed on traditional male terms , we have to measure it in terms of the degree of choices that women and men have			1
" " about 20 % of the responses i got to the @entity73 article i published , were from men			0
they said : ' i want to be a fully engaged father ' or ' i want to take time to be with my parents as they age , ' and ' if you think it 's hard for a woman to ask for flexible hours , or work from home , or work part time , well if a man asked for those things , not only is he told he 's not sufficiently committed to his career , he 's told either explicitly or implicitly that he 's not really one of the guys			1
' " " if you notice in comparison to 40 years ago , pretty much every male star you see is toting a baby , is out with his children , is equally engaged as a dad and proud of it			0
so that 's an interesting marker on popular culture			0
" " i said to my 16 - year - old son : ' would you mind if your wife out - earned you ? ' he looked at me at first and was like : ' are you crazy ? ' and then he said : ' guys who are really insecure about that are really insecure about something else			0
' and i thought : ' it 's a different generation			0
' " " why ca n't a man marry well ? why ca n't a man find a woman and marry and people say : ' wow that was a great catch ' and part of what that means is that she earns a great living and they 're going to both live very comfortably , and they can provide caregiving and breadwinning however they want			1
" opinion : our predatory capitalist system need not be a zero - sum game learn : five things you did n't know about @entity199 's new boss watch : the orphan who became a billionaire ' @entity201 ' @entity0 's @entity203 contributed to this report .			0

academic @entity25 says @entity1 is ' posterchild for engaged fatherhood '
equality is n't just about women 's issues , it 's about men sharing breadwinning and caregiving
many men find it difficult to take time out from work to care for family
