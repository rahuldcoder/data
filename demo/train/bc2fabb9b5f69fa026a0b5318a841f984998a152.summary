for everyone who has condemned the numerous protests , rallies and vigils demanding justice for @entity5 , the 17 - year - old gunned down in @entity7 , @entity8 , a month ago , please listen to these two words : shut up ! of course that may seem harsh , but that is exactly how i feel			1
i do n't want to hear the nonsense to let the system run its course			2
others say , " let 's not do anything until all of the facts are in			2
" let 's cut to the chase : there would be no special prosecutor had thousands across the national not mobilized , organized and took to the streets to demand justice for @entity5			1
would a grand jury be convened on april 10 ? not a chance			2
would the 911 tapes be released showing admitted trigger man @entity31 calling @entity5 suspicious , and owning up to following him ? no. would the @entity8 @entity32 be reviewing -- and discussing changing or abandoning -- the controversial " @entity36 " law , which is at the heart of this case ? no. would the @entity37 have launched an investigation into the case , as well as the @entity39 ? nope			1
would @entity7 's police chief , @entity40 , have stepped down if the inept investigation had n't been exposed ? no. instead of critics condemning the protests , they should be saying , " thank you ! thank you ! thank you ! " whether folks want to admit it or not , this has always been the story of african - americans			1
go through history and you will find many examples of cases not being investigated or , if they were brought to trial , prosecuted or judged atrociously : @entity55			1
justice is supposed to be blind , but for african - americans , it has commonly been deaf , dumb and blind			1
as a result , we 've had to live by the admonition of former slave and abolitionist @entity68 , who said , " agitate ! agitate ! agitate ! " it was also @entity68 who stated , " @entity72 concedes nothing without a demand			0
" the main demand in the @entity77 case from @entity78 was for @entity31 to be arrested and for justice to be served			1
this was n't about a ridiculous bounty on the head of @entity83			0
it was n't about the selling of t - shirts			1
it was n't about who showed up and led a march or why			0
it was about holding a legal system accountable that clearly gave more credence to a 28 - year - old gunman than the 17 - year - old , unarmed man who was gunned down			1
for all of our talk about law and order in this country , there is a lot that is wrong with our legal system			0
we all should feel ashamed when someone is freed from death row or life in prison after dna testing revealed him or her not to be the real killer or rapist			0
it should pain our heart when the prosecution withholds evidence in a case that could exonerate someone			2
and all of us , regardless of race or economic status , should scream to high heaven when the police do n't do their job equally for all citizens			0
we are a nation of laws , and sometimes they work for some and not others			0
when we 've prayed , cried and pleaded , oftentimes the only thing we have left to do is march			0
that is a right that is afforded every one of us in the @entity132 , be it the @entity134 , @entity135 or those demanding justice for @entity5			1
no one should be condemned for taking to the streets and letting their voices be heard			0
they should n't be called race - baiters , rabble - rousers or radicals			2
we all should call them exactly what they are : true @entity149 .			0

without protests , the @entity77 case would be going nowhere , @entity151 says
history is rife with examples of *injustice* against african - americans , @entity5 says
instead of condemning those *clamoring* for justice , we should thank them , he says
