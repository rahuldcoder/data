-- after 116 years , it seems the @entity3 movement has finally embraced equality			0
for the first time in the history of the quadrennial @entity7 , every one of the 204 competing nations at @entity9 is represented by both male and female athletes			0
@entity12 stars such as heptathlete @entity13 , swimming sensation @entity14 and sprinting champion @entity15 enjoy media profiles which rival those of their male counterparts			0
coupled with the historic decision to allow female athletes from @entity23 and @entity24 to compete at the @entity25 for the first time , it shows how far the @entity3 movement has come since the @entity25 of 1928			2
food , glorious food : @entity3 athletes ' extreme eating habits that was when women were given the chance to become olympians for the first time			2
you would think those ground - breaking first champions would be world - renowned for their pioneering efforts			0
but you would be wrong			0
just take the remarkable case of @entity40 -- one of the forgotten female heroes of track and field			1
" she 's not terribly important anymore , " past president of the @entity47 , @entity48 , told @entity0			2
" she probably had a little bit of influence back then as the first woman to win a gold medal in track and field , but she was very little - known			1
" women 's track and field was not very popular in the @entity57 at that time and she did n't get a whole lot of publicity , so she was overshadowed			1
" @entity60 , medals and @entity62 : the numbers behind the @entity9 that she is so forgotten is remarkable given her astonishing life			0
imagine @entity66 had taken up sprinting just four months before his world - record - smashing run at the @entity68			0
now imagine the @entity70 star was just 16 years old when he wowed the world in @entity72 , and you begin to get an idea of what @entity57 schoolgirl @entity75 achieved 84 years ago			1
@entity75 , of @entity78 , @entity79 , dashed to 100 meters gold wearing a skirt and vest , an outfit a million miles from the skintight speed suits worn today , in just her sixth competitive race			1
yet that victory was just the start of her most extraordinary story			0
can @entity66 make @entity3 history ? in april 1931 , three years after that historic win , @entity75 was involved in a plane crash over @entity94			1
having being discovered on the roadside by a passerby who took her for dead , @entity75 was bundled into the trunk of a car and driven to a mortuary			2
after the error was eventually spotted , she remained unconscious for seven weeks , but her injuries were so severe she was unable to compete for three and a half years			2
even when she returned to the track , the damage to @entity75 's leg meant she was unable to crouch in the starting blocks			1
@entity75 still managed to run in the 4 x 100m relay at the @entity111			1
eight years after bursting onto the @entity3 scene , @entity75 ran the third leg of the relay for the @entity57 team , helping them win gold under the watching eye of @entity119 and @entity122 's @entity121 rulers			1
the @entity122 quartet , which qualified fastest for the final in a world - record time , were disqualified after dropping the baton			0
for @entity75 it was a remarkable rise , fall and rise , made all the more unfathomable when you consider she was only discovered as an athlete when one of her school teachers spotted her running to catch a train			2
four track meets and six races later , @entity75 was an @entity3 champion and a joint world record - holder			1
" she ran her first race that we know of in march 1928 , " @entity48 said			2
" she was a natural talent			0
she finished second in that race behind @entity57 record - holder @entity144			0
in the second race she ever ran she tied the record for the 100m , which got her to the @entity3 trials where she finished second			0
" despite her landmark medal , @entity75 's low - key profile was at odds with her achievements both during her life and since her death from cancer in 1999			1
the crash which damaged her leg also robbed her of her peak years			0
when she should have been cementing her position as the world 's fastest woman , @entity75 watched other sprinters assume her mantel			1
" in 1932 @entity163 ( a gold medalist in hurdling and the javelin at the @entity166 of 1932 ) came in and evolved into the big name and pushed everyone else onto the sidelines , " said @entity48			0
@entity75 's athletic honors may not have brought her the fame and fortune her modern - day equivalents enjoy , but it did not diminish her passion for the sport she had left such an indelible footprint on			1
" she married and raised a family , " @entity48 said			0
" she stayed involved in track and field with the @entity180 in the @entity57 doing timekeeping at meets and she did some public speaking as well			2
" perhaps @entity75 's relative anonymity is a saddening , if inevitable consequence of the passing of time			1
" it 's a shame , " said the @entity57 historian			0
" in @entity190 people know about gold medalists like @entity192 and @entity193 , but i could tell you about athletes from the 1920s or 30s who most of the @entity190 public would n't know about			0
" so when the women 's 100m champion is crowned at the @entity202 on saturday , it is unlikely the champion or the vast majority of the 80,000 crowd in the @entity206 will have the faintest idea who @entity75 was			1
but , by crossing the line first in @entity210 all those years , ago , she guaranteed her place in the history books , even if it 's not on the front page .			1

@entity40 won women 's 100m gold at the 1928 games in @entity210
it was the first olympics where women were allowed to compete
aged 16 , @entity75 became the first women 's track and field gold medal winner
the @entity79 native almost died in a plane crash but returned at 1936 @entity111
