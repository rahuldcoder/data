-- in the ghettos of the @entity3 , one woman is on a mission to bring glamor to the region while at the same time educating and inspiring promising young talent from the area			1
@entity9 has always been interested in fashion			1
but what started as the dream of a young girl from a small town outside of @entity15 , @entity16 , has become a reality years later in the ghettos of @entity19 in the south of @entity21			1
in december 2010 , @entity9 started her fashion label @entity23			1
with designs inspired by @entity21 , reflecting the vibrant colors and traditions of @entity27 , @entity9 decided on an ethical twist to her organization			1
she wanted to use fashion as an instrument for change in the region			1
" i thought , ' why ca n't we use fashion as a vehicle to make a difference ? ' we should lead by example , " says @entity9			1
" we should do something that will make a difference and inspire other people			2
that is what i want to do with @entity44 : positive action			2
" @entity46 is this season 's color at @entity49 the label 's ethos is to engage with the local community as well as provide opportunities and training to the people who need it most , says @entity9			1
she held casting sessions in various local communities , choosing 21 young girls aged 16 to 25			2
with no prior experience in modeling , they underwent training at " @entity63 " in professional skills such as make up and hairstyling , runway walking , posing and other fundamental tricks of the trade			2
these women became the " @entity23 girls " and work with the label to promote and model the designs			1
their role also gives them the opportunity to meet people , work with other designers and learn skills to take with them in the future			2
@entity9 says : " i tell them , ' not all of you will become a top model			1
learn the most you can			0
' " it 's a job that we enable them to explore themselves			0
this [ @entity92 ] is a city with 18 million people -- one of the biggest cities in the world			0
and now they are learning that if they work hard they can achieve anything			0
" and @entity9 's campaign of inspiration seems to be working			1
twenty - year - old @entity102 stumbled across @entity23 by accident but says it has changed her life forever			2
she says : " i was just walking down the road and someone told me i looked like a model and asked me to go to the casting that was going on			0
" it has allowed me to learn so many things			0
i 'm meeting new people and i can achieve more in life ... apart from being a model , which is my dream , i also want to go into fashion designing because i love colors			2
it 's a beautiful profession			0
" another young model from the region , @entity120 , was an unqualified teacher in a small local school			2
like many others in the @entity19 ghettos , life before @entity44 was a constant struggle for her family			0
why @entity27 designers are finally in the fashion spotlight she says : " you have to fight for your living ... i lived with my parents , my brothers , my sisters , and we tried to make ends meet			2
with @entity44 , it was an experience that added something different and brought a new feeling to me			0
" it 's not everyday in life that we have the opportunity to do what we want to do ... being part of @entity23 has showed me that i can do things			0
it made me believe in myself			0
having that in my head ... has been the most exciting part of this experience so far			0
" @entity9 says that one year in , the journey has , at times , been difficult			1
" @entity21 is such a hard country			1
it is very real , " says @entity9			1
" there are some very creative designers but no distribution			0
production is challenging , and there is no light , no electricity			0
all the time we are running generators			0
it makes everything expensive and hard to run a business			0
" these obstacles were captured by @entity169 filmmaker @entity168 , who directed a documentary about @entity44 called " in our ghetto			0
" the film follows the girls over three weeks providing an insight into the lives of the @entity23 models as they prepared for the launch of the label			1
@entity168 admires the message that @entity9 is trying to send to the community			1
" i was mostly impressed with the amount of self - confidence that @entity9 's project brings to these girls , " he says			1
the @entity186 women who dress like @entity187 " [ @entity19 is ] quite a hard and depressing place , but incredible and vibrant as well			0
it 's a city that has overgrown its infrastructure and it 's not got the amenities it needs to function as a city , " he adds			0
regeneration is part of @entity9 's larger and rather ambitious plan for the region			1
as well as continuing with the brand and educational elements , she wants to try different types of training			2
" our focus is on the community , " she says			0
" what we want to do for next year is organize training for tailors in skills like draping , dress - making , making patterns and creating new fabrics			1
" we will show the participants the same way we got the models and i know they will be able to use those skills and get jobs straight away			1
" @entity9 believes @entity21 need to embrace products made in @entity21 , rather than imported items			1
" we need to create the capacity for manufacturing and development , " she says			0
" it will take time and it is not a short - term project			0
but fashion is my passion so i want to make it an industry			2

@entity230 designer @entity9 has started an ethical fashion label in @entity21
@entity9 has trained and hired girls from the region to become models and brand *ambassadors*
next year she hopes to inspire more locals and teach tailoring skills
