@entity0 -- the @entity2 wednesday released the results of its undercover investigation looking at deceptive and questionable marketing practices at 15 for - profit colleges in six states and @entity0 the written report was presented at a hearing wednesday of the @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , and was accompanied by video of the undercover applicants interacting with recruiters from the various educational institutions			1
in his opening statement , committee chairman sen. @entity19 , @entity20 , said that the evidence points to a systemic problem within the for - profit education system			2
" are students -- and @entity27 taxpayers -- getting good value for the billions of dollars they are investing in these schools ? " he asked , according to his prepared remarks			0
according to the report , all 15 schools were guilty of some sort of dodgy statements in information about " the college 's accreditation , graduation rates and its student 's prospective employment and salary qualifications , duration and cost of the program , or financial aid " that they passed on to the @entity2 undercover applicants			1
at one college , school officials told the @entity2 applicant that after completing an associate 's degree in criminal justice , the applicant could try to go to work for the @entity56 or the @entity57			2
in fact , a bachelor 's degree is the minimum requirement for positions like @entity56 special agent or @entity57 clandestine officer , although there are other lower - level positions for which an applicant could apply			0
at a small beauty college , the undercover applicant was told that barbers can earn $ 150,000 - $ 200,000 per year			0
although this is possible , 90 percent of barbers make less than $ 43,000 per year , according to the @entity72			0
the @entity74 administration has proposed rules to limit federal student aid funds to for - profit career colleges that do not prepare students for " gainful employment " in recognized occupations			1
" while career colleges play a vital role in training our workforce to be globally competitive , some of them are saddling students with debt they can not afford in exchange for degrees and certificates they can not use , " according to secretary of education @entity93			0
the proposed law uses two criteria for judging the for - profit career colleges : the relationship between the debt that students incur verses their income potential , and the rate at which the students repay their college loans			1
according to the @entity2 , " enrollment in for - profit colleges has grown from about 365,000 students to almost 1.8 million in the last several years			1
" these colleges offer degrees and certifications in programs ranging from business administration to cosmetology			0
in 2009 , students at for - profit colleges received more than $ 4 billion in @entity119 and more than $ 20 billion in federal loans provided by the @entity121 , " the agency 's summary said			1
the @entity2 report also found that many programs at the for - profit colleges studied cost " substantially more for associate 's degrees and certificates than comparable degrees and certificates at public colleges nearby			1
" a student interested in a massage therapy certificate costing $ 14,000 at a for - profit college was told that the program was a good value			1
however the same certificate from a local community college cost $ 520 , " a summary of the report on the @entity2 website said			2
@entity140 , founder of the group @entity141 , thinks the federal government should broaden its research			0
" the problem goes well beyond the for - profit sector ; it permeates academia generally , including community colleges and four year universities , " he said			2
sen. @entity149 , @entity150 , also suggested looking beyond the current probe			0
" in focusing on for - profits , we are not being objective , and we are ignoring the bigger picture of what is happening across all of higher education , " he said at the hearing .			0
