@entity0 , @entity1 -- with their fine shirts , ­ their initials embroidered on them , ­ their cufflinks and custom made jackets , the @entity4 twins ­ @entity5 and @entity6 seem the prototype of the @entity14 banker			1
their hairstyle , their clothes , their gestures , everything is almost identical			0
both were indeed bankers in @entity21 financial district , but nowadays you are likely to find them at baby fairs in @entity1 , @entity24 , and other @entity26 countries promoting their new line of baby wear called " @entity29			1
" " we always wanted to start our own business , " @entity5 says			1
" the work is very different from what we used to do , but at least you [ are ] building something that is your own , " @entity6 completes the sentence as seamlessly as only identical twins can			2
the work certainly looks very different from banking			2
the twins patiently explain their new products to inquisitive mothers as babies hover around the stand at the baby fair -- sometimes falling over , sometimes crying after falling to the floor			2
it is loud , hectic and very hot , but @entity5 and @entity6 know this is the best way to reach their potential customers			2
their company offers something they say is new on the @entity1 market : fully organic baby clothes , made from 100 per cent organic cotton and sewed by hand in small factories in @entity1			1
" basically , we saw that the trend towards eco-friendly garments was slowly coming to @entity1 , " @entity5 says			1
" the market here is not as big as in the @entity64 , but we believe it will certainly pick up , " @entity60 again chimes in and completes the thought			0
@entity5 and @entity4 's move back to @entity1 is more than a homecoming -- it is also a vote of confidence in the @entity1 economy			1
after years that saw the country 's best and brightest leave @entity1 to get an education and work experience elsewhere , more and more @entity1 are returning as their economy has shown itself robust during the international crisis while countries like the @entity64 have faced a much deeper recession			1
" we see the potential in @entity1 , " @entity60 says as he folds some baby shirts from the new collection			1
experts have yet to put numbers on the new trend of returning to @entity1 , ­ a process labeled " brain gain " by some , ­ but former expats say they know of many people who are coming back to try their luck in their home country			1
still , employment agencies warn that a lack of skilled labor could hamper @entity97 further economic development			0
" we see a lack -- especially of project managers on construction sites , " says the @entity99 agency , one of the biggest in the world , " but there is also big demand for plumbers , carpenters and of course in the service sector			0
" poles who are returning know they are heading into an adventure			0
@entity114 used to work in marketing in @entity14 but recently returned to @entity0 to help her parents run three clothing stores			2
she says in the beginning the times were hard , but now things are getting better			0
" the skills i learned abroad are certainly helping me here , " she says as she folds some designer shorts			0
" having operated in @entity14 it is possible to succeed almost everywhere in the world and i want to put the skills i have acquired to good use in my country			0
" the sooner the better for @entity114 , she says she would like to start a business of her own			0
with the headquarters in @entity1 .			0

more and more @entity1 are returning from abroad to find greater work *opportunties* at home
@entity1 twins ­ @entity5 and @entity60 left the @entity14 banking *industry* to set up business in @entity1
today the pair have a *successful* organic baby clothes business , with *excellent* *forecasts* for *growith*
