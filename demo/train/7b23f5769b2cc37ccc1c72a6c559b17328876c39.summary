-- when will homophobia in the @entity2 start seeming so ridiculous it 's laughable ? not in 2013 , it seems			2
on thursday , the governor of @entity6 , @entity7 , grinned as he compared , in a television interview , same - sex marriage to a brother marrying his sister			2
" i apologize to anybody who feels offended by that , " he said later			2
worse , football players and other students from @entity18 reportedly heckled a tuesday night performance of " @entity20 , " a play about a gay college student , @entity22 , who was tortured and murdered in 1998			1
they yelled anti-gay slurs , including the three - letter f - bomb , the play 's director told the university newspaper			2
" this behavior by some students reflects poorly on all of us , and it reinforces our commitment to teaching inclusivity and civility to young people who still have much to learn , " two university officials said in a prepared statement			0
homophobes and the football teams that harbor them understand they should apologize			1
maybe that should be seen as an improvement			0
but it does n't seem genuine to me			1
these apologies are designed to placate the gay community , not embrace it			0
the comments themselves are reduced to the realm of political gaffes instead of being seen for what they are , which is hate speech that contributes to gay kids committing suicide and to parents rejecting kids who come out to them as gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender			0
so , how to respond ? one route has been taken by writers like @entity61 at @entity62 and @entity63 at @entity64			0
they 've called for @entity18 to find and suspend the football players who yelled the slurs			1
another way to react -- the one i 'd prefer -- would be to laugh these inane remarks off because they 're so isolated and are n't indicative of attitudes in modern @entity73			1
but that 's clearly not the case yet			0
i spent two weeks in @entity76 earlier this year talking to @entity78 people , both closeted and open			0
the state is hostile to them			0
celebrate same - sex marriage in @entity82 all you want , but in @entity76 , and in many other states , gay people not only ca n't get married , but they also can be fired by their employers , evicted by landlords and denied the right to adopt children simply because of their sexual orientation			1
related : the county where no one 's gay these comments are n't random or isolated			1
they come from a place of deep - seated ignorance about homosexuality and gay people that leads both to hateful slurs and backward legal arguments			0
silencing those voices wo n't do the trick			1
they need to be won over			0
the university is taking a smart step by requiring all students who attended the play on tuesday night to participate in a " dialogue session " about the hate speech			0
but i 'll also propose a symbolic response : root for @entity18 if you 're going to their game versus @entity117 at 7 p.m. et on saturday , or to other games this season , wear something to indicate your support for the lgbt rights movement			1
if you 're staying home , tweet a photo or put it on @entity125 with the hashtag # gaysforolemiss			0
or , if that feels weirdly new - media - for - the - sake - of - it , just tell a friend that you hope @entity18 wins the game			1
( dear @entity117 fans : i do n't hate you			2
please do n't e-mail me			2
) one problem i encountered in @entity76 is that @entity78 people are largely invisible			0
they can be out and open about who they are , but their friends and neighbors are comfortable ignoring them , pretending they do n't exist , or pretending that 's not who they are			2
the antidote : be seen			0
and give people a chance to change			1
show the football players that @entity73 is on their side -- that we want to see them succeed			1
and if you ca n't do it for them , do it for @entity149 , who told the @entity150 about what it was like to be the only openly gay member of the heckled cast			1
" ... [ @entity154 ] o be ridiculed like that was something that really made me realize that some people at @entity18 and in @entity76 still ca n't accept me for who i am			1
" if you 're in @entity76 , prove him wrong			0
if not , show him you 've got his back			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity164 .			1

@entity18 football players reportedly heckle a performance of " @entity20 "
@entity169 : it would be nice if we could laugh at such *stupidity* ; but we ca n't yet
the solution is to give the football players a chance to change , @entity164 says
@entity164 : one way to do that is by supporting @entity18 and its team
