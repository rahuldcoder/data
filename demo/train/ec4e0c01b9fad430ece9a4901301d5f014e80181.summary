the @entity0 sends troops across the border , and the @entity3 and its allies cry foul			2
it 's happened before -- @entity6 in 1979 , @entity7 in 2008 -- and now @entity9 president @entity8 has essentially seized military control of the @entity11 from @entity12			1
the move reflects the still simmering political and social upheaval from the breakup of the @entity16 more than two decades ago			0
what has n't changed much are the limited options available to president @entity19 and @entity21 powers to respond to the @entity0 's aggression			1
the @entity3 and some other countries boycotted the @entity24 in 1980 , and @entity25 helped arm @entity6 rebels against @entity16 forces , who eventually went back home			0
in @entity7 , @entity9 backed secessionist bids in the @entity32 and @entity33 regions in sovereignty disputes that remain unresolved			0
the @entity3 and @entity35 consider the regions part of @entity7			0
here is a look at possible responses to @entity8 's latest move in @entity12 : military unless a sudden escalation causes open warfare between @entity12 and @entity9 , forget about any kind of @entity3 or allied military response			1
secretary of state @entity46 said sunday the @entity3 was keeping its options open , but he made a point of adding that escalated military involvement would " not serve the world well			0
" " the last thing anybody wants is a military option in this kind of situation , " @entity46 said on @entity52 's " @entity51			0
" even veteran sen. @entity58 of @entity59 , a proponent of exerting @entity3 influence abroad , conceded that the fight must involve diplomacy , not the military			0
" there is not a military option that could be exercised now , " @entity58 said monday in remarks at the @entity66 's annual conference			0
" but the most powerful and biggest and strongest nation in the world should have plenty of options			0
" on monday , the @entity3 put on hold all military - to - military engagements with @entity9 , an official announced			1
" although the @entity76 finds value in the military - to - military relationship with the @entity9 we have developed over the past few years to increase transparency , build understanding , and reduce the risk of military miscalculation , we have , in light of recent events in @entity12 , put on hold all military - to - military engagements between the @entity3 and @entity9			1
this includes exercises , bilateral meetings , port visits and planning conferences , " said @entity76 press secretary rear adm. @entity86			0
he denied reports speculating on possible ship movements in the region			0
" there has been no change to our military posture in @entity21 or the @entity98 ; our @entity100 units continue to conduct routine , previously planned operations and exercises with allies and partners in the region , " he said			0
@entity105 , a former @entity3 ambassador to @entity12 in the administration of @entity108 president @entity107 , suggested one possible military response would be for @entity110 to agree to deploy additional forces in countries with significant @entity9 populations			1
@entity105 noted on @entity114 that @entity9 used the need to protect @entity9 citizens and interests as a pretext for what he called " blatant aggression " in @entity12 now and previously in @entity7			2
what you need to know @entity124 the annual summit of the world 's industrial powers is scheduled for @entity9 @entity129 venue @entity128 in june , but the @entity3 and other members have halted planning for the gathering amid calls for @entity9 to be kicked out			1
once known as the @entity134 , the group that also includes @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 agreed to add @entity9 in 1998 to reflect the changing geopolitical dynamic after the @entity142 and breakup of the @entity16			2
revoking @entity9 's membership would isolate @entity8 diplomatically to deny him the @entity147 acceptance he has sought			0
" he will be isolated more			0
he wo n't look good in front of his people , " @entity114 chief international correspondent @entity148 said monday			0
such isolation would bolster economic isolation and sanctions -- a more effective strategy to pressure @entity8			0
" the @entity124 plus some others and all of them , every single one of them are prepared to go to the hilt in order to isolate @entity9 with respect to this invasion , " @entity46 said sunday on the @entity156 program " @entity157			0
" @entity164 divided @entity12 ? think again sanctions @entity19 said monday the @entity3 is examining a series of economic and diplomatic steps to " isolate @entity9			1
" @entity46 also said foreign leaders were prepared to act as well , noting the possibilities include visa bans , asset freezes and isolation by the international community on trade and investment			0
@entity108 rep. @entity108 of @entity176 , the chairman of the @entity177 , told @entity114 on monday that " the achilles heel for @entity9 is their economy -- the ruble			1
" " we have to lead and we have to rally @entity21 around a series of steps that would actually impact the @entity9 economically : sanctions against state - owned banks , " @entity108 said			1
later monday , a spokesman told @entity114 that the @entity3 has suspended upcoming trade and investment talks with @entity9			1
" due to recent events in @entity12 , we have suspended upcoming bilateral trade and investment engagement with the @entity0 that were part of a move toward deeper commercial and trade ties , " said the @entity3 trade representative spokesman , who spoke on the condition of anonymity			1
what 's happening ? depends on whom you ask diplomacy @entity19 had a lengthy phone call with @entity8 over the weekend in which the @entity3 leader said his @entity9 counterpart violated international law by sending military forces into @entity11 , according to a @entity209 statement			1
" president @entity19 wants to emphasize to the @entity9 that there are a right set of choices that can still be made to address any concerns they have about @entity11 , about their citizens , but you do n't choose to invade a country in order to do that , " @entity46 said on @entity156			1
@entity8 has yet to make any substantive public statement about the situation , which follows the successful staging of the @entity225 in @entity128 to bring @entity8 and @entity9 some pride in the international community			2
the thrust of the @entity9 position is that it had the right to protect the interests of @entity9 in eastern @entity12			2
on monday , vice president @entity232 called @entity9 prime minister @entity233 to urge @entity9 to " pull back its forces , support the immediate deployment of international monitors to @entity12 , and begin a meaningful political dialogue with the @entity12 government , " the @entity209 said			1
@entity19 outlined a similar approach to reporters later monday , saying that should satisfy @entity9 concerns of protecting the rights of ethnic @entity9 residents and @entity9 citizens in @entity12			1
separately , @entity246 spokeswoman @entity245 said the @entity3 has scrapped plans to send a presidential delegation to the upcoming @entity249 in @entity128			1
@entity3 athletes still plan to compete			0
politics @entity252 will have a say in the focus and size of a @entity3 response , with calls already for a possible sanctions package			1
hawkish @entity108 have criticized @entity19 for what they called a lack of resolve that they say emboldened @entity8 to send troops into the @entity11 region			2
@entity58 called @entity19 's foreign policy " feckless " on monday , after @entity267 chairman @entity266 of @entity268 said on " @entity269 " that @entity8 and @entity9 had been " running circles around us			2
" fellow @entity108 sen. @entity272 of @entity273 called for reviving plans for a @entity110 missile defense shield in @entity276 that @entity9 opposed			2
@entity19 told reporters on monday that there should be " unanimity " between @entity285 and @entity108 in seeking to preserve " the principle that no country has the right to send in troops to another country unprovoked			2
" " my expectation is we ought to be able to get @entity252 to work with us to achieve that goal , " he said , specifically calling for an economic assistance package for @entity12 to help provide stability during the crisis			1
sen. @entity292 , who is chairman of the @entity293 , said monday the panel was putting together legislation to provide $ 1 billion in loan guarantees for @entity12 's economy			0
" we are also consulting with the administration on possible sanctions actions against individual @entity9 and @entity12 that range from visa bans and asset freezes , to the suspension of military cooperation and sales , as well as economic sanctions , " the @entity299 @entity298 said			1
a @entity108 member of the committee , @entity308 of @entity309 , told @entity114 he was urging the panel to speak with " one voice " to " show the @entity9 that this is something we are unified in			2
" " it will send a much more powerful signal and hopefully get @entity8 to think twice , " @entity308 said , adding that " @entity8 needs to pay a big price here " because " this is no time to be shrinking violets and rely on words			0
