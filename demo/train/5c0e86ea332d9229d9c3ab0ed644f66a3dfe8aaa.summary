-- @entity1 is a machine			1
when @entity4 burst to prominence two years ago , fronting a five - piece rock band as vigorous as any that 's emerged from the @entity7 in recent memory , it was clear that she was something special : a vocalist with extra horsepower who hurtled through love songs like a truck tearing down an empty highway on a moonless night			1
@entity1 's second album is as dark , robust and romantic as ever , but a revving 18 - wheeler is no longer the apt metaphor for @entity4 's voice			1
listen to her hooting and growling on " only if for a night , " a ballad somewhere between classic soul and midnight - on - the - moors @entity26 art rock			1
listen to " @entity27 , " a treatise on heartbreak and spiritual rebirth			0
" i am done with my graceless heart / so tonight i 'm gon na cut it out and then restart , " she cries , over guitars and keyboards that heave and chime			0
this is the sound of a human turbine -- a wind machine			0
video : @entity42 with @entity4 on their 2009 debut , @entity1 were a wiry rock band with a taste for melodrama			1
here the scale is vastly inf lated : turbulent ballads , powered by booming drums and vocal chorales rising like distant thunder , full of @entity4 's banshee wails			2
the music touches on @entity55 melodies , bluesy rock stomps , nods to goth and gospel			1
but the wind never stops howling			0
@entity4 is a hopeless romantic obsessed with bad romance			2
song after song casts relationships as struggle , with a hair 's breadth separating rapture from disaster			2
for @entity4 , love is a force as vast and violent as nature itself			0
in " @entity74 , " a spurned lover goes to a watery grave : " oh , my love , do n't forget me / i let the water take me / lay me down / let the only sound / be the overflow			0
" @entity1 's @entity4 on getting @entity80 and forgetting her own lyrics this is a very @entity83 record , drawing on a tradition of iconoclastic @entity7 pop that stretches from @entity86 and @entity87 to @entity88			1
there 's also a hint of another large - lunged @entity91 here			1
listen to " @entity92 , " where @entity4 blasts out a gospel - soul - style lead vocal over an arrangement that winks at the thudding backbeat of classic @entity96			1
@entity97 , anyone ? the rock band most forcefully evoked on " @entity99 " is one of the biggest of all time : @entity102			0
like them , @entity1 are a true band , who channel garage - rock camaraderie into a huge , lashing sound more fit for an @entity107 mountain peak than a garage			1
and like @entity102 , @entity1 are fronted by a singer with the pipes , and the shamelessness , to pull off the melodrama -- to turn the ridiculous into the sublime			2
2011 has been a banner year for left - of - center women rockers , from @entity115 to @entity116 to @entity117			0
those women are boutique stars , as , for the moment , is @entity4			0
but " @entity99 " suggests she could be a rock star , and a big one			0
the album concludes with the rock - gospel uplift of " leave my body , " as @entity4 roars out a vision of transcendence : " i 'm gon na leave my body / moving up to higher ground / lose my mind			1
" it 's a big song , with a big , brash , @entity131 - worthy sentiment			2
and a voice to match			0
