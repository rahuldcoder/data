-- as a group of martial art students are put through their paces in downtown @entity5 , grandmaster @entity1 sits at the side of the room wearing a quiet look of contentment			1
the 65 - year - old has devoted his adult life to spreading the word about @entity13 , a form of martial arts originating in @entity16			1
the youngsters have put on an impressive show for the cameras , running through @entity13 's frequently spectacular repertoire which includes scissor kicks and choreographed sword fights			2
that the martial art has such a loyal following in @entity16 is in large part down to the efforts of @entity1 , who has spent more than four decades fostering its development			1
at his age , @entity1 could be forgiven for wanting to put his feet up , but there is always more work to be done , he says			0
" my dream is to open an academy , a big school , so people from other countries can come to @entity16 to research and learn @entity13 , " @entity1 told @entity0 's @entity34 series			2
" vovinam is suitable for all people ... especially it is suitable for training programs for the armed forces and as self - defense for women , " he says			1
founded in @entity46 by grandmaster @entity47 in 1938 , @entity13 fuses elements of traditional @entity16 martial arts and other martial arts from around the world			1
it combines both hard and soft elements , says @entity1 , referring to the contrasting methods deployed in martial arts to repel an attack			1
a " hard " approach would see a defender meet oncoming force with force while a " soft " approach uses an opponent 's forward momentum as a catalyst to disarm or destabilize			0
" with its wide variety of techniques , @entity13 is the complete martial art , " says @entity64 , vice-president of @entity65			1
" for example , @entity70 uses principally ( throwing ) techniques , @entity69 uses kicks and in karate , ( there is ) no manipulation of traditional weapons			2
" vovinam melds all these separate disciplines , employing kicks , punches , throws , self - defense , wrestling and traditional weapons together with a signature leg - grappling technique			1
this latter move can be quite literally breathtaking to behold and involves a spectacular flying scissor - kick ( called a @entity89 ) that disables an opponent by seizing the leg , body or even the neck			1
there are also impressive demonstrations of self - defense with weapons , as the students from @entity5 display with gusto			1
firstly , a man brandishes a halberd ( a six - foot pole with a wide , glinting blade at its tip ) before whirling it around like a majorette might twirl a baton			0
moments later , two girls carrying swords demonstrate the art of self - defense -- it 's like they are rehearsing a stunt sequence for the next martial arts blockbuster			1
but in @entity13 , the physical is married to mental restraint and composure			2
" you must have a strong mind , a strong will to work in any circumstances			0
the richness of @entity13 also resides in the equilibrium of technical and philosophical practice , " says @entity64			2
above all , @entity13 is a philosophical martial art which aims to make better citizens for society rather than train fighters , he says			1
@entity130 has been practicing since he was 16 and started teaching in earnest in the early 1970s becoming director of a training center in the south central province of @entity135			0
in 1978 , he was the first person to reinstate @entity13 in @entity5 ( formerly @entity5 ) following the end of the @entity137 in 1975			0
after helping oversee the sports resurgence in his homeland during the 1980s , he turned his attentions to developing the sport abroad , organizing demonstration events in more than 20 countries , starting with @entity144 in 1990			0
today , the @entity145 estimates that the martial art has one million participants in @entity16 with a further 500,000 active in 52 countries around the world on five continents			1
in @entity152 alone , @entity64 reckons there are around 10,000 practitioners and earlier this year the @entity152 capital , @entity151 hosted the fourth @entity156			0
" @entity13 was originally @entity16 and now today has become a martial art for everyone , " says @entity64			1
in 2009 , it was accepted onto the program of the @entity161 before making its debut at the @entity164 two years later			0
back in @entity5 , @entity130 can reflect on a life 's work with a degree of satisfaction and pride			0
" i 've led this martial art life , generally i am not rich			2
compared to people who do other jobs , i can be poorer , " he says			0
" i follow this path because of my passion and the spirit of the sport and because i have learned it so i have to repay the debt to my teachers			0
" despite his advancing years , he 's still flexible enough to run through a few routines that would leave most sexagenarian 's rigid with fear			0
" there are many benefits to @entity13 , it gives me physical strength and energy to work			2
when i practice , i feel healthy and it helps me stay away from the drinking ! " read more : @entity193 is my office read more : tearful toddler to table tennis queen			0
