-- i 've been a @entity2 user for about 11 years			2
and since i made the switch , i never thought the day would come when i 'd say this : i 'm excited for the next version of @entity6			1
this fall , @entity7 will launch @entity6 8 , a radical redesign from the @entity6 you 've grown accustomed to since @entity10 made its debut 17 years ago			1
windows 8 has been reimagined from the ground up , and it 's built to run on both the traditional desktop and touchscreen tablets			1
at first glance , you 'll notice the classic start menu is gone , replaced by a gorgeous tile layout full of your favorite apps and files			1
@entity7 calls this the " @entity22 " interface			1
imagine it as a blown - up version of the @entity26 interface used on several smartphones now			0
those little tiles provide live updates with news , sports , weather , @entity28 mentions and @entity34 updates without you even having to open the app. in one quick glance , you can get all the information you need			0
it 's not the same old @entity6			2
and that 's what makes me so excited to try the final version of @entity43 this fall			2
in a very un-microsoft move , the company created the most radical redesign of the desktop in well over a decade			1
it 's incredibly functional , too			0
a beta version @entity43 is available as a free consumer preview , and i 've been using it for the last few weeks			0
right now , there are only a handful of prototype tablets that run @entity6 8 , so i 've been using it on a laptop instead			1
however , since the @entity22 interface is designed more for touch than a mouse cursor , there 's a bit of a learning curve with @entity43			0
scrolling through the @entity64 screen can get confusing on a keyboard until you learn all the shortcuts			0
but once you do , the experience is incredible , unlike any operating system i 've ever used			0
it 's the perfect hybrid of old and new			0
while @entity71 attempts slowly to merge its mobile operating system into the desktop with new @entity75 - like features , @entity7 made a bold move and jumped ahead to the future where most computing takes place on touch - friendly smartphones and tablets			1
it 's enough to make an @entity71 fan like me drool			0
but what if you 're worried you wo n't be able to catch on to the new look in @entity43 ? the classic @entity6 is still there in @entity43			1
@entity7 hid it behind the @entity22 interface			2
that means you get the same old taskbar , start menu and desktop full of icons for your favorite apps			1
it 's a great way to ease the transition			0
plus , some apps such as @entity100 and @entity101 just work better on the classic desktop			1
of course , it 's far too early to tell if @entity7 's gamble with @entity43 will pay off			2
consumers have been slow to adopt @entity106 , and @entity43 is essentially just a blown - up version of that			0
but if @entity7 can get me this pumped up over a new product , then it must be doing something right			2
