@entity6 had n't updated the the @entity17 since 2009 and had quit mentioning it , even at @entity7 - specific events			1
but some loyalists still love it			0
although it does n't have the touchscreens of new models like the @entity22 and is downright huge in comparison with the sleek nano and miniscule @entity25 , the @entity17 packed a whopping 160 gb of storage			1
that 's enough to hold 40,000 songs , according to @entity6			1
hands - on with the new @entity6 watch on social media , users were reacting with real emotion , bidding farewell to a " good buddy " and " old friend			0
" to some , it was perhaps a bit of nostalgia , losing the only remaining @entity7 that bears a resemblance to the original and other early models			0
