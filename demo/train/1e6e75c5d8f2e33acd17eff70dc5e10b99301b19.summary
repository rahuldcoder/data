-- @entity1 did n't invent what 's on the @entity3			1
it just seems that way			2
in 1977 , @entity1 , his father @entity6 and his sister @entity7 published " @entity8			1
" the compendium of cleverly presented facts , such as " 15 people who became words , " " 10 men who were supported by their wives " and " 6 positions for @entity16 -- in @entity18 , " was n't just simple enumeration			2
it featured detailed explanations about its subjects , proving itself a worthy and entertaining reference work			0
" @entity8 " immediately took its place on another list -- the bestseller list -- and spawned three sequels			1
more than three decades later , in the internet age , its impact is everywhere			0
countless websites , including @entity0 , have turned to lists -- sometimes in the form of galleries -- to help tell stories in a digestible way and boost page views			1
topics range from " @entity39 " to " 13 team names that will make a @entity42 " to " 11 things you did n't know about @entity45			1
" sure , you ca n't copyright an idea that goes back to @entity48 and @entity49 , but one might think that @entity1 might be seething about seeing his child so misused			1
not in the least , says the author , @entity53 historian and creator of the website @entity56			0
" i was thrilled when the @entity3 came around , " he says			0
he understands that the list concept makes it easier to process information , and " i 'm glad to have done what i could			1
" these days , @entity1 , 66 , devotes his time to @entity56 , an attempt to create a different kind of information repository : a site all about the business of government , including details about dozens of government agencies and names of hundreds of government officials			1
currently @entity72 features the @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 ; plans call for it to cover every @entity73 state and every country in the world			1
" we pride ourselves on accuracy , double - checking , " he says			0
" the internet is so full of junk and not - researched material			0
... we try to emphasize policy instead of politics			0
" @entity0 spoke to @entity1 about lists , government and finding himself referenced on @entity90			1
the following is an edited and condensed version of the interview			0
@entity0 : have you ever reflected on the impact of " @entity8 " on the internet as we know it ? @entity1 : oh , sure			1
but i ca n't take credit because i have in my collection a book of lists that goes back to the 17th century			2
certainly the ideas have been there			0
i was thrilled when the @entity3 came around			0
@entity0 : why do you think the @entity3 is so full of lists ? @entity1 : i think we live in an era of over-stimulation -- too much information -- so lists are a way of grasping that information			1
it just makes it easier to do 11 of this or 7 of that			1
it just makes it easier to sort out that overwhelming amount of information			1
@entity0 : what sites using lists do you admire ? @entity1 : i like @entity125			1
i feel like they 've picked up the baton and done a wonderful job			0
they just have great categories			0
i really admire their obscure categories			0
i think the best lists are the ones you ca n't just look up -- you have to really think about and research			2
the ones that are n't easy			0
@entity0 : when " @entity8 " came out in 1977 , it was a huge bestseller			1
did you expect the reaction ? @entity1 : no , not really			1
my father and i had compiled a book , " @entity142 , " and one of the chapters was lists , just list - lists			2
we got a lot of feedback on the list chapter , and my father said , look at all this			0
what if we did a whole book of lists ? so we did it , and we thought , why just do one through 10 , when you can tell a little story behind it			2
i think that 's what really made it a success			2
@entity0 : many websites use lists for clickbait , not for shedding any light on the subject at hand			2
does this bother you ? @entity1 : oh , sure			1
one thing i do n't like is where there 's a list or a gallery and you have to click for no. 2 , click for no. 3 , click for no. 4			2
they 're just trying to get you to have more page views and sell more ads. i do n't want to have to do that			0
i just want to see the list on one page			0
@entity0 : what 's the story behind @entity56 ? @entity1 : i was looking at the budget of the @entity73 and i was overwhelmed by how much i did n't know as someone who follows politics			1
something like 95 % of what the government did does n't get covered			2
i asked ( @entity192 , where @entity1 was a contributing editor ) if i could do this article on where our tax dollars go			1
@entity197 ( also ) did a sidebar on ridiculous projects about to be funded			0
the one i picked out to visit was the @entity201 , which was n't so well known at the time , and it ( became ) the cover story			0
but when all the publicity about this died down , it was the other article i could n't get out of my mind			0
so i made this list of more than 300 agencies in the @entity73 government , their budget , how many people they employ and that 's how i got the idea for @entity72			1
( the site 's been live since 2009			2
) @entity0 : the @entity3 is supposed to be the great leveler , now that there 's all this information out there			2
but are you concerned we get caught up in bread and circuses ? the @entity201 got a lot of attention partly because it had a catchy name			0
@entity1 : yes , certainly that 's the case			1
all i can do with @entity72 is put it out there			1
if people are interested in the @entity234 or the @entity235 , then they will find this , and they will find the only independent view on the internet of it			0
@entity0 : do you think the @entity3 has made us more tribal ? @entity1 : you started to see that with the introduction of cable television			1
it used to be that everybody watched the same news channels and that was it			2
the minute cable came in , you got that breakup of what people were watching			0
the @entity3 is just an extension of that			0
but what makes the @entity3 so great is that it 's interactive			1
you can see opposing sources -- if you know how to use it			0
i 'm so honored it happened my lifetime , just from an information point of view			0
@entity0 : i ca n't be the first person to ask you about creating the @entity3			0
@entity1 : i have n't looked in the last year or two , but at one point on @entity90 it actually mentioned that either " @entity142 " or " @entity8 " was the progenitor of the @entity3			1
( laughs ) i do n't know if it 's still there .			2

@entity1 's " @entity8 " used an *influential* format now all over web
" @entity8 " was a bestseller when it came out in 1977 , spawned three sequels
@entity1 now head of @entity72 , compilation of government news and info
@entity1 : with lists , " it just makes it easier to do 11 of this or 7 of that "
