-- her passion for public speaking and networking have earned @entity5 the moniker " queen of networking " and made her one of the most influential people in the @entity8			1
as the founder of knowledge networking business @entity13 she aims to create more face - to - face meetings and live debates in a digital age where many opinion - formers are far too isolated in their corporate silos			1
to that end , @entity5 founded the @entity22 ideas festival in 2009 to connect people from " different walks of life -- business , culture , media , politics , academia , with each other in a very intensive setting			1
" @entity0 's @entity33 to the @entity34 caught up with @entity5 to talk about the brainstorming retreat she 's created , the rising popularity of ideas conferences and the importance of intellectual stimulation			1
an edited version of the interview follows			2
@entity0 : what is @entity22 ? @entity5 : it 's a mini-festival about ideas -- that 's the best way i can describe it			1
each year , 150 to 200 participants from diverse backgrounds such as business , politics , law , or arts set off on a three days long journey to talk about the things that really matter			1
what makes it attractive to people is that in this environment where everything is busy and rushed , actually slowing down is a counter-intuitively refreshing and rewarding thing to do			2
@entity0 : is your conference aimed at connecting mind , body and soul ? @entity68 : it seems that something happens physically and chemically when you go for a journey			1
when people relax , they give more of themselves			2
rather than just dropping out of the office for an hour and then rushing back , you are with a small family of people for a period of time			0
all sorts of ideas begin to exchange really fruitfully , friendships and business developments form			1
what people really want is to be looked after , as if they were going to a sort of " ideas holiday			0
" @entity0 : why do you think that events like this proved so popular over the past decade ? @entity68 : the " ideas conference " is still relatively young -- the @entity90 conferences celebrate their 30th anniversary this year ; names @entity22 is seven years old			1
i think it is no accident that we see more public and private festivals in the decade that 'd seen @entity99			0
so , as a knowledge networking company , we explore how people crave a face - to - face connection in a @entity99 age			1
whilst technology enables everybody to connect , what actually moves the dial on relationships and connections is that when you speak to someone , you look in their face , you take a read of their body language			0
i think this is why the intensity and the immediacy of an elongated conference work so well			2
@entity0 : names not numbers has been described as an " intellectual @entity122			0
" what does that mean to you ? @entity68 : in a working world , we sometimes forget that people like to be intellectually stimulated			0
many do n't often get the opportunity in their day jobs to use all the bits of their brain and their emotions			2
we hope we allow that to come out a bit			0
@entity0 : do you think that idea conferences may pose a risk of over-stimulation in today 's information age ? @entity68 : i think the age of overload is a real risk for people			2
and one of the benefits of coming away for two or three days of content that other people put together for you is that it actually allows you to relax			0
you do n't have to fervently read and go online , screen a million emails and worry about what you 've missed			0
so , in a curious way , actually having a very rich , immersive period of time is reassuring -- the programming has been done for you			0
