@entity1 acknowledged as one of the finest racehorses to ever jump a fence , @entity0 drew the crowds for his comeback at a wintry @entity9 , saturday			1
the nine - year - old , renowned for his attacking style of spectacular jumping , was back after spending 13 months on the sidelines with a heart murmur			1
on his toes before the race and with a silky sheen of sweat on his skin , this enthusiastic chaser looked in excellent physical condition and seemed eager to do his job on his belated return			0
but his gusto might have proved his undoing given his distinct lack of big race running			0
the nine - year - old was scratchy early in the race and his jumping scruffy , but he traveled powerfully into the straight under jockey @entity31			1
@entity0 looked the winner approaching the second last obstacle before being shot down by the overwhelming run of @entity35			2
" there was no messing about			0
they went a good gallop and it just found him out in the end , " trainer @entity38 told the media at @entity9			1
" i loved the way he traveled			0
only one day matters and he 'll come on plenty for this			0
" the day in question is the @entity51 at the @entity52 in march , the best two mile steeplechase in the @entity55 horse racing calendar and a race which @entity0 won by 19 astonishing lengths in 2013			2
that performance was described by respected ratings organization @entity60 as " the finest performance of the modern era			0
" yet as @entity9 was cloaked in dusk and the crowd began to wend their way home while the bookmakers balanced their books , news broke of @entity0 bleeding from the nose after the race			1
while @entity38 said that this issue could not have affected his comeback performance , questions began to form about further implications for his @entity52 participation			1
despite reasons for hope after his comeback , a heart murmur is not a problem that will immediately wisp away but rather one that will still require vigilance			2
after optimism in defeat , the coming days will prove whether doubt will more sternly shroud one of the greatest horses we are ever likely to see .			0
