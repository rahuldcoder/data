@entity0 -- @entity3 native @entity2 began his music career as a child			1
as an adult , he spends his days blowing the same sad song : taps			1
as the sole bugler for the southern region of @entity0 's @entity11 -- part of the state @entity13 -- @entity2 travels five days a week from cemetery to cemetery , playing at funerals of military servicemen and women and veterans			1
he started three years ago and has n't missed a day since			2
for @entity2 , playing taps at the funerals of men and women who served the country holds significant meaning			1
" it 's an honor and a privilege to help bring closure to a family and help honor the veterans who have paid a price for me to be able to enjoy the fruits of this country , " he said			2
" to come out everyday and play taps and say thank you is a very small price			2
" taps has been played at military funerals since some time during the @entity39 , according to the @entity41 @entity40			1
it was written by maj. gen. @entity43 in july 1862 as a revision to the bugle call signaling " lights out , " which @entity43 felt was too formal to note the day 's end			0
by 1891 , @entity48 regulations required taps to be played at military funerals			1
aware that there was a shortage of buglers because of the large number of funerals a day , @entity2 contacted the military about bugling after he attended his godfather 's funeral , where a recording of taps was played			1
about 1,800 veterans die each day , most of them from @entity61 , according to the @entity62			0
because the military can not provide enough buglers to play at such a large number of funerals , @entity63 passed a law in 2000 to allow a recorded version to be played			1
@entity2 said he has made it his mission to eliminate the recording -- and honor the families and service of veterans -- by playing taps at as many funerals he can attend			1
the most he 's ever done in one day is 26			0
" every veteran has the right to get military honors , and taps , in my opinion , should be played live as opposed to having a recording , " @entity2 said			1
his passion seems to have struck a chord with veterans and other honor guard members			0
" hearing it live sends a more heartfelt symbol that we actually do care about that soldier , that we 're actually there for him , " said spc. @entity87 of the @entity0 honor guard			0
" with mr. @entity2 , you hear the feeling , you hear every note			0
with a recording , it 's just very bland			0
" for a professional trumpet player like @entity2 , taps is technically an easy song to play			2
" it 's sort of like asking a concert pianist to play ' chopsticks , ' " he said			0
" but at the time it needs to be played , when emotions are running high , it 's probably one of the most difficult things to play			2
" very often , @entity2 hears sobs or wails from people at the funeral while he 's playing ; he 's even seen widows collapse as he 's sounded his first note			0
to get through it , he tries to only concentrate on the music			0
" a lot of times , i have to close my eyes and just pay attention to what i 'm doing and just think of it musically , because if i get too emotionally involved in it , i could get to the point where i could n't play , " @entity2 said			0
@entity2 has played his bugle for more than 3,000 veterans and active duty servicemen and women and has no plans to stop			1
" doing this is a great honor , and i plan to do it for as long as i can and for as long as they 'll have me			0
