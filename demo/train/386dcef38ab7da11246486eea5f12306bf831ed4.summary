@entity0 , @entity1 -- an arrest has been made in the investigation of an illegal prescription drug ring connected to actor @entity6 , a spokesman for @entity1 's attorney general said wednesday			1
attorney general @entity9 is not revealing details of the arrest , his office said , but it comes soon after he revealed that pharmacy records show the actor got thousands of dangerous pills from dozens of doctors in the past year			1
the person arrested was not directly connected to @entity6 but is suspected to be part of the drug ring , @entity9 spokeswoman @entity16 said			1
@entity9 said last week that @entity6 's death was linked to an " illegal and massive prescription - drug ring			1
" although the actor 's family said @entity6 had reduced his drug use to near zero , @entity9 said friday on @entity27 's " issues with @entity26 " that he did n't see " any ' zero ' pill consumption			1
" " if he took all the pills that our records show he was prescribed over the last year and three months , he took very damaging assaults on his body , " @entity9 said			0
@entity6 , 38 , had pneumonia , an enlarged heart and water in his lungs when he died march 10 , @entity35 deputy coroner @entity34 said			1
but a drug overdose can not be ruled out until toxicology results are completed , which will probably be in several weeks , @entity34 said			2
state investigators know that @entity6 obtained " massive amounts " of legal drugs " in what looks to me like a questionable manner because of so many doctors , " @entity9 said			2
" how many people go to 10 or 15 or 20 doctors and then run around to 10 , 12 and more pharmacies to go fulfill them and sometimes two different doctors in the same day ? " @entity9 asked			0
@entity6 's most recent prescription was filled march 5 for @entity53 , he said			1
" in the weeks before that , more @entity53 , more valium and other things , " @entity9 said			0
" if you go back to 2009 , you 're talking thousands of pills , " he said			0
" you 're talking many , many doctors			0
i doubt if they know about each other			0
you 're talking about many , many pharmacies			0
" the 1980s teen movie star died after collapsing at the @entity0 apartment he shared with his mother			0
the illegal prescription ring involved the use of stolen identities from doctors to order official prescription pads , @entity9 said			2
" once they get that prescription pad in the doctor 's name , then they can write a prescription , or they can sell it to someone to write a prescription like @entity6 , " @entity9 said			1
" then he can go into the pharmacy and get his legal drugs illegally			0
" the former child actor also obtained @entity83 using one of the counterfeit prescriptions last year , @entity9 said			0
despite @entity9 's statements , @entity6 's manager insists that it was not a drug overdose but a perhaps drug reaction that took the actor 's life			1
just weeks before his death , @entity6 began seeing an addiction specialist to help completely kick his dependence , manager @entity93 said			1
@entity93 and @entity6 's mother suspect that something went wrong with that treatment			1
" there was a prescription that was given to him that he had never taken , and he only took one , and i have a funny feeling that he had a reaction to it , " @entity93 said			2
@entity6 's mother told the specialist not to give her son the pills , he said , and @entity6 fell ill with flu - like symptoms soon after he took just one of the pills			1
on march 9 , hours before his death , @entity6 stayed with his mother in the apartment they shared on the edge of @entity115 , @entity1			1
" it was like he had a flu , but he was slurring like an overdose , " @entity93 said			0
" he was very coherent and talked normal			0
" the loss is harder for family and friends to grasp because it came at a time when @entity6 had much to live for			2
he was helping his mother with her cancer treatments , using income from two recent feature film roles to pay her medical bills , @entity93 said			0
several prescription drug bottles were taken from @entity6 's apartment , deputy coroner @entity34 said friday			1
although the bottles indicated that the drugs included @entity53 , @entity135 and @entity136 , no tests have been done to confirm what they are , he said			0
@entity6 had a prescription for the muscle relaxer @entity136 and the narcotic pain reliever @entity53 filled at a pharmacy february 26 , a source with knowledge of the transaction said			1
two days after @entity6 picked up the drugs , his primary care doctor called the @entity149 pharmacy to ask about the prescriptions , the source said			2
the doctor said " @entity6 was not feeling well " and he needed to know what drugs had been prescribed , the source said			2
the source , who worked at the pharmacy , asked not to be identified because his employer had not authorized him to talk			0
@entity9 said @entity6 got prescriptions from four or five different doctors in the past three months			2
@entity93 said he had talked to @entity157 in recent months about the dangers of easy access to prescription narcotics			0
@entity6 said he wanted @entity1 legislators to pass " @entity6 's law , " which he said should prevent doctors from prescribing more than a three - day supply of addictive drugs at one time , his manager said			1
in recent years , the actor was reunited with longtime friend and frequent co-star @entity169 in a reality show			0
" @entity174 " ran for two seasons on the @entity172 before it was canceled			0
@entity6 's most famous role was in the 1987 movie " @entity177 , " in which he also appeared with @entity169			1
