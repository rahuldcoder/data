@entity0 -- the federal government said monday it is proceeding with a plan to require gun dealers in four @entity6 border states -- @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 -- to report the sales of high - power rifles under certain conditions in an effort to stem the flow of guns to @entity18 drug cartels			1
critics immediately called the move an illegal expansion of gun - control laws and an effort to divert attention from the " @entity26 " gun controversy			1
and the @entity27 said it will file suit to stop the move			1
under the new policy , gun dealers in the four border states will have the same reporting requirements for certain long guns that gun dealers nationwide currently have for hand guns			1
they will be required to give purchaser information to the @entity39 ( @entity39 ) if someone purchases two or more semi-automatic rifles in a five - day period , but only if the guns are greater than .22 caliber and have the ability to accept a detachable magazine			1
if no investigative leads result from the information , the information will be purged in two years			0
deputy attorney general @entity48 said in a statement the new rule is tailored to focus on guns that " are highly sought after " by criminal organizations near the border			2
the rule , he said , " will improve the ability of the ( @entity39 ) to detect and disrupt the illegal weapons transfers " from gun buyers in the @entity57 to drug traffickers in @entity9 and along the border			1
rep. @entity60 , @entity61 , praised the action , saying @entity39 agents testified to @entity64 recently they needed the ability to track weapons to disrupt the cartels			0
@entity69 acting president @entity68 urged president @entity70 " to do all in his power to protect this valuable new initiative from the gun lobby 's inevitable efforts to attack it in @entity64 and the courts			1
" he also called for stricter laws to prevent trafficking in the first place			0
but critics called the action a " diversionary tactic " to take attention away from @entity64 's ongoing investigation into the " @entity26 " program , in which the @entity39 allowed people suspected of being straw - purchasers of weapons to sell their weapons , hoping to build bigger cases against @entity18 criminal organizations			1
" this political maneuver seems designed to protect the careers of political appointees at the @entity96 and not public safety , " rep. @entity91 , @entity7 , said in a statement			2
" this ( @entity26 ) has become a full - blown scandal , and i think they 're trying to change the subject from @entity26 to something else , " said @entity98 vice president @entity98			0
@entity98 said the action defies the clear intent of @entity64 regarding the reporting of gun sales			2
" what you 've got here is the @entity70 administration stepping into the shoes of @entity64 and essentially legislating , " @entity98 said			0
" we are immediately filing lawsuit in federal courts			0
" @entity98 said the @entity27 would file suit as soon as the @entity39 delivers the first " demand letter " requiring a licensee to report the sale of a long gun			1
@entity98 said the new rule is " an attempt to inch president @entity70 's ( anti-gun ) agenda down the road			0
once they get into four states , they 'll expand it to @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132			0
i think it 's a nose in the tent , " he said			0
the long - gun reporting proposal pre-dates disclosures about the " @entity26 " controversy			2
the @entity39 first published the proposal in the @entity139 , seeking public comment , on dec. 17 , 2010 , and published a second notice on april 29 , 2011 , requesting public comments for 30 days			0
but critics said the administration moved forward with the proposal to re-frame the " @entity26 " debate			0
rep. @entity60 , meanwhile , said he plans to introduce legislation with rep. @entity149 , @entity151 - @entity150 , to establish a dedicated firearms trafficking statute " to provide law enforcement with an additional tool to combat gun traffickers			2
" @entity60 issued a report last month that recommended @entity39 collect reports of multiple long gun sales .			1

the policy applies to gun dealers in @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10
gun dealers must report sales of high - power rifles under certain conditions
authorities say it 's an effort to stem the flow of guns to @entity18 drug cartels
critics say it 's an illegal expansion of gun - control laws ; the @entity27 says it will sue
