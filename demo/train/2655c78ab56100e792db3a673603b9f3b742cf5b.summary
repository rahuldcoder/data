-- street food is suddenly hip , but in @entity3 it 's as old as salt on pretzels			1
so we asked a @entity8 vendor for dirt on -- well , how dirty are those carts , anyway ? he wanted to be anonymous			1
we agreed , so long as he gave us extra kraut			2
@entity14 or @entity15 ? i 've worked in a lot of restaurants -- and trust me , these carts are a heck of a lot cleaner			1
the customers can see and smell our whole operation			2
if our chicken and veggies do n't smell fresh , we ca n't hide that and the people walking past are n't going to stop and buy			2
plus , our carts are so tiny , they 're simple to keep clean			1
we just suds them up and hose them down every night			2
in restaurants , customers usually ca n't see how clean the kitchens are , and most of the time , they probably would n't want to			1
@entity34 : confessions of a cruise ship musician bathroom breaks i used to have a fruit cart , and i was the only one who worked there , so bathroom breaks were n't really an option			2
i remember trying so hard to hold it all day long -- not fun			2
sometimes , if i could n't wait any longer , i 'd take the cash from the cart , run as fast as i could to the nearest restroom , and then run as fast as i could right back , hoping and praying no one would steal anything			2
surprisingly , only once did some crazy kids take off with my whole cart			0
leftovers i 've been doing this a long time , so by now i have a pretty good idea how many hot dogs i 'm going to sell each day ( about 80 ) and how many platters of chicken and rice ( 40 )			0
it 's rare that there 's any food left over by closing			1
if there is , we pitch it out			0
yeah , i know i could serve it the next day -- and that might save me $ 10 -- but my customers would taste the difference			0
and then they would n't come back , and maybe they 'd tell their friends or the tourists on the corner not to come to me either			0
and then i 'd be out way more than the $ 10 i saved			0
it 's not worth it			1
i learned that the hard way			0
@entity34 : be a packing genius handouts occasionally , i get a few homeless people who come and ask for a bit of food			1
i ca n't spare the money to feed everyone , but if they 're polite , i always give them a little something			1
what 's a single hot dog to me ? i sell them for 99 ¢ each			1
but to them ... how to treat a celebrity i used to get a lot of big names at my baked - potato cart			1
@entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 -- they all came			0
@entity98 even stopped by once			0
he saw the big line out front at lunchtime , so he came around to the back of my cart and asked if he could buy from me there			0
i told him the line was in the front			0
he asked , " do n't you know who i am ? " i said , " of course , the @entity108 ' to the oldies exercise guy ! but you still got ta wait in line			0
" he had his chauffeur do it			0
he ordered two baked potatoes with a little butter and scallions			0
@entity34 : 6 places germs breed in planes customer service people are distracted at lunchtime , yapping on their cell phones , punching their @entity126			1
i ca n't tell you how many times they 'll ask for one thing -- white sauce and hot sauce on their chicken and rice , for instance -- and then say that 's not what they ordered when i give it to them			2
but it 's not my job to be right			1
it 's my job to make them happy -- and to make them come back			1
i need a steady line			0
nobody trusts a cart without customers lined up			0
