whilst the energy grids we rely on to provide us with cheap and reliable electricity may have been fit for purpose in the 20th century , it is now abundantly clear that the design of 21st century energy networks will have to be very different			1
in @entity10 , the foundations for a secure , flexible and more energy efficient future are already being laid			1
the @entity12 project will transform how electricity is supplied in @entity10			1
instead of centralized power generation , new suppliers will be linked up providing new trading opportunities for businesses and homeowners			1
traditional carbon - based power generators are far from efficient			2
they waste well over half their energy in heat and contribute over a third to total greenhouse emissions			1
it is now widely accepted that continuing to rely so heavily on such polluting systems would not only spark environmental catastrophe but also economic collapse			2
with an aging electricity grid , a drive to lower carbon emissions by 2020 and burgeoning new markets in renewable energy , the time was right for @entity10 's leaders to set about trying to find another way			1
the result is @entity12 -- one of many projects set up under the @entity39 's @entity38 ( @entity38 )			1
combining the expertise of industry , @entity42 's , scientists and regulators , @entity12 is proposing a fundamental shift away from traditional energy supply models			1
work on the vision of the project started in 2005 and was followed up by the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) in 2007			2
this summer will see the publication of the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) which will take the project a step closer to realization			2
@entity56 , vice-chairman of the @entity57 is currently co-editing the @entity52			1
he spoke to @entity58 about how the @entity12 will differ from the old networks and the challenge of replacing the electricity grid across 27 @entity39 states without any loss of power			1
" the grids built in the 1950s and 1960s were designed for power to effectively be poured in at the top -- big central generation			0
this power then went through transmissions systems and then smaller wires for distribution to the home , " @entity56 told @entity58			0
instead of energy just being pumped one - way down wires and into homes , @entity12 envisions a two - way flow of electricity , where customers -- big and small -- not only receive energy but also generate it themselves and , when necessary , make it available to the grid			1
it 's hard enough trying to create a reliable system that is able to manage this complex interaction between power generators			1
but when you throw in the complication of 27 member states , each with their own networks , all at different levels of maturity you start to realize the scale of the task at hand			1
" it takes up to 40 years to completely replace a grid , " @entity56 said			0
" in order to get this right we need to change things at the right pace			0
we 're not changing the grid like for like but with smarter more intelligent bits of kit			0
" an example of this is the automated regional active network management system -- @entity110 for short			1
a collaborative project between engineering company @entity112 -- where @entity56 heads up technology and business development -- @entity115 , @entity116 and seven leading @entity118 universities			0
" @entity110 is trying to take a slightly different view of life , " @entity56 said			0
" if you go back 50 years we used to have local control centers around the networks , with people there telling us what and where a problem was			0
@entity110 is trying to mimic this but also enable microgrids which can be maintained in their own right , away from the main grid			0
" @entity56 wishes to stress that this is a very simplified explanation , but , in a nutshell , the idea is to change from what he describes as a ' passive ' network -- one designed to cope with a peak load -- to an ' active ' network which balances multiple power generation with demand , resulting in vastly improved energy efficiency			1
the push towards more intelligent electricity grids is a global phenomenon			2
the @entity147 is currently researching an @entity148 and @entity56 recently visited @entity149 for an international symposium on the issue			0
@entity152 , president of the @entity152 , is a big supporter of @entity12 and believes that new inter-connected power grids mark the beginning of what he describes as the ' @entity156 '			1
the first @entity10 @entity12 are still a way off			1
but how does @entity56 think you and i might experience the system come 2050			0
" the idea , " @entity56 explains , " would be that instead of having a meter in your house , you would now have a smart gateway which would be programmable			0
" he sites scenarios where consumers might , for example , want to sell some surplus energy from their house back to the grid			2
" the ability to trade will be automated , " says @entity56			2
" you choose what you want to do			0
" at the other end of the stream , wind farm generators for example , instead of being told that they are generating too much energy because the grid can not cope , there will be an arbitration which goes on automatically to maximize their throughput and maybe back off using a high carbon energy source			2
" @entity56 is well placed to offer a balanced assessment of the tasks that lie ahead			0
he combines a business role -- soon to take up a new post as managing director at @entity189 -- with academic duties -- he is a visiting professor at both @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 in @entity194			0
" the business case for a government is different to that of a ceo			0
we are trying to make sure that the right things are in there for each of those audiences , " he said			0
he admits that nobody would be considering @entity12 in usual economic terms , but climate change has changed the game			1
and he 's convinced that advances in renewable energy technology -- a key aspect of the @entity12 vision -- will keep pace with the project			1
" you ca n't limit your imagination by what you have today , " he said			0
" if we are going to get security of supply with low carbon and renewable resources you then have to start looking at how they will be delivered to the end user			0
what are the economics if you do n't do it ? well , you might not have a business , or the lights might go out			0
" watch @entity152 explain about how energy grids of the future will work here .			2

the @entity39 hopes @entity12 will transform @entity10 's electricity network in 21st century
new network will span 27 @entity10 countries aiming to *achieve* ' active ' energy
vice-chair of @entity57 predicts an automated trading of energy
