-- rapid - fire tv news bulletins or getting updates via social - networking tools such as @entity5 could numb our sense of morality and make us indifferent to human suffering , scientists say			1
scientists say updates on networking tools such as @entity5 are often to quick for the brain to fully digest			1
new findings show that the streams of information provided by social networking sites are too fast for the brain 's " moral compass " to process and could harm young people 's emotional development			1
before the brain can fully digest the anguish and suffering of a story , it is being bombarded by the next news bulletin or the latest @entity5 update , according to a @entity29 study			1
" if things are happening too fast , you may not ever fully experience emotions about other people 's psychological states and that would have implications for your morality , " said researcher @entity30			0
the report , published next week in @entity41 , studied how volunteers responded to real - life stories chosen to stimulate admiration for virtue or skill , or compassion for physical or social pain			2
ireport.com : growing pains for @entity5 , @entity51 ? brain scans showed humans can process and respond very quickly to signs of physical pain in others , but took longer to show admiration of compassion			1
" for some kinds of thought , especially moral decision - making about other people 's social and psychological situations , we need to allow for adequate time and refection , " said @entity59			0
she said the study raises questions about the emotional cost , particularly for young people , of heavy reliance on a torrent of news snippets delivered via tv and online feeds such as @entity5			1
she said : " we need to understand how social experience shapes interactions between the body and mind , to produce citizens with a strong moral compass			2
" @entity29 sociologist @entity84 said the study raised more concerns over fast - moving tv than the online environment			1
" in a media culture in which violence and suffering becomes an endless show , be it in fiction or in infotainment , indifference to the vision of human suffering gradually sets in			0
" research leader @entity98 , director of @entity29 's @entity99 , said the findings stressed the need for slower delivery of the news , and highlighted the importance of slow - burn emotions like admiration			2
@entity98 cited the example of @entity109 president @entity108 , who says he was inspired by his father , to show how admiration can be key to cultural success			0
" we actually separate the good from the bad in great part thanks to the feeling of admiration			0
it 's a deep physiological reaction that 's very important to define our humanity			0
" @entity5 , which allows users to swap messages and links of 140 - characters or less , says on its web site that it sees itself as a solution to information overload , rather than a cause of it			0
this function , it says , " means you can step in and out of the flow of information as it suits you and it never queues up with increasing demand of your attention			0

@entity29 study says rapid - fire @entity5 and news updates are too fast for brain
scans show humans respond rapidly to pain , but not compassion , admiration
