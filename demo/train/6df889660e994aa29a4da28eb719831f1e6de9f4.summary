a federal judge has turned aside calls to publicly release video and photographs of the @entity5 military raid and aftermath that left @entity8 leader @entity7 dead			1
@entity9 , a conservative legal group , had asked the @entity10 to comply with a @entity12 request for the material , especially photos of the september 11 mastermind lying dead on the third floor of his @entity18 hideout			1
the group argued it was being " irreparably harmed " by the @entity23 administration 's " unlawful withholding of requested records			2
" but judge @entity24 ruled thursday there were legitimate national security interests to deny disclosure			2
" a picture may be worth a thousand words			0
and perhaps moving pictures bear an even higher value , " said the @entity31 - based judge			2
" yet , in this case , verbal descriptions of the death and burial of @entity7 will have to suffice , for this court will not order the release of anything more			1
" deported @entity7 family members head to @entity42 @entity9 made its initial request the day after the commando assault by @entity45			0
a similar request for material was filed against the @entity48			0
president @entity23 had announced that the @entity5 government would not reveal any photographs of the may 2 , 2011 , military action and @entity7 's subsequent burial at sea			1
some members of @entity55 have been allowed to privately view the materials this week			0
some @entity8 - affiliated leaders , along with domestic and foreign websites and blogs , have questioned whether @entity7 was really killed and whether the details of his death released by the administration were accurate			1
a may 9 , 2011 , letter from the @entity10 to @entity9 -- mentioned in the legal complaint -- stated , " at this time , we are unable to make a release determination on your request within the 20 - day statutory time period " required by federal law			1
the legal group had the option of filing an administrative appeal directly with the @entity10 , rather than going for a lawsuit			1
" the @entity5 people have a right to know , by law , basic information about the killing of @entity7 , " @entity9 president @entity74 said then			1
" incredibly , the @entity23 administration told us that it has no plans to comply with the @entity12 law , so we must now go to court			0
president @entity23 's not wanting to ' spike the football ' is not a lawful basis for withholding government documents			0
this historic lawsuit should remind the @entity23 administration that it is not above the law			0
" @entity23 had barred any public release of photos or video , telling @entity93 , " it is important to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence or as a propaganda tool			1
" he added , " we do n't trot this stuff out as trophies			0
we do n't need to spike the football			0
" @entity9 calls itself a " a conservative , nonpartisan educational foundation ( promoting ) transparency , accountability and integrity in government , politics and the law			0
" the case is @entity9 v. @entity5 @entity10 ( 1:11 - cv - 890 ) .			2
