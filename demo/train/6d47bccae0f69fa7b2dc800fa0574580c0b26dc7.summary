-- retired baseball star @entity1 says he 's looking forward to fighting perjury and other charges brought against him thursday and again denied he ever used performance - enhancing drugs			1
a federal grand jury in @entity7 has charged the seven - time @entity9 winner with perjury , obstruction of @entity12 and making false statements over his insistence to a @entity15 that he never used steroids or human growth hormone			1
" i never took hgh or steroids			0
and i did not lie to @entity12 , " @entity1 said in a statement posted on the website @entity21			1
" i look forward to challenging the government 's accusations , and hope people will keep an open mind until trial			0
i appreciate all the support i have been getting			0
i am happy to finally have my day in court			2
" @entity1 left baseball in 2007 after 24 seasons in the major leagues , during which he played for the @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36			2
he was the first pitcher to win seven @entity9 awards , ranks third in all - time career strikeouts with 4,672 and ninth in all - time wins with 354			0
the charges stem the longtime pitcher 's february 2008 appearance before the @entity43			1
both @entity1 ' former trainer , @entity45 , and a report by former sen. @entity47 stated that @entity1 had used banned substances at points in his career			2
rep. @entity51 , then the committee 's chairman , said perjury and false statements " are serious crimes that undermine the ability of @entity12 to perform its duties			1
" " whether he committed a crime will be up to the judge and jury , " the @entity59 @entity58 said in a written statement			0
but he said the investigation , which @entity51 and then - ranking @entity66 @entity65 requested , " are important actions to protect the integrity of the @entity43 's oversight work in this area and to help end the use of steroids and performance enhancing drugs in professional sports			1
" during the february 2008 hearing , @entity1 vehemently denied using performance - enhancing drugs			1
steroid use " is totally incompatible with who i am and what i stand for , " he told lawmakers , adding , " i can not in good conscience admit to doing something that i did not do , even if it would be easier to do so			0
" the six - count indictment , returned by a grand jury in @entity7 , states that @entity1 " did corruptly endeavor to influence , obstruct , and impede " the congressional investigation into the use of steroids by him and other major league players			1
it includes three counts of making false statements to investigators about the use of human growth hormone , steroids and vitamin @entity100 , and two counts of perjury stemming from his appearance before @entity51 's committee in 2008			1
that testimony put him at odds with @entity45 as well as one - time @entity36 teammate @entity107 , who told a league investigation led by @entity47 that @entity1 admitted using human growth hormone			2
a few weeks later , the committee 's leaders asked the @entity111 to launch a perjury probe of @entity1			1
@entity114 ' lawyer , @entity113 , told reporters thursday that the pitcher expected the indictment			0
" @entity1 has known from the very beginning that if he chose to publicly deny the accusations in the @entity119 , that this day would come , " @entity113 said			2
he said he warned @entity120 he would be called before the @entity15 if he issued that denial , and if he repeated it in front of @entity12 , he would likely face perjury charges if he had used steroids , " all he had to do was just admit he did it and move on like @entity107 , " @entity113 said			1
but he added , " i think people will understand sometimes the government 's wrong			0
" " now that they are ready to move forward , we are too , and we 'll let everything get taken care of in the courts , " he said			0
@entity1 told investigators that @entity107 -- who admitted to using human growth hormone on two occasions himself -- must have " misheard " him , and he accused @entity45 of lying " to save his own skin " as federal authorities began probing the use of steroids in major sports			2
he filed a defamation suit against his ex-trainer in late 2008			0
@entity1 said the shots he recieved from his trainer were vitamin @entity100 , which is an allowed substance			0
but the trainer never had access to @entity100 and never injected him with such supplements , the indictment states .			0

@entity1 denies *allegations* and says he wants his day in court
charges include obstructing @entity12 , false statements and perjury
in 2008 , @entity1 testified that he did *n't* use performance - enhancing drugs
