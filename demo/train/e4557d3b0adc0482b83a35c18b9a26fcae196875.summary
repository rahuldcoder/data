to some , @entity0 marks the start of summer			1
but to veterans and their families , @entity0 is one of the most difficult and hallowed days of the year			1
a time to reflect on our fallen heroes and to think of survivors of wars gone by			0
lost , injured or home safe and sound , our military and veterans communities are facing grave challenges that deserve national attention			2
yet , as this @entity0 approaches , stories about @entity15 , the @entity16 , and the @entity17 's seizing the phone records of @entity19 and @entity21 reporters are taking up almost all of the focus in @entity24			1
after the @entity0 observances conclude and before @entity24 returns to business as usual , we need to ensure we are doing right by those who have served to protect our nation			1
on @entity0 , nearly 900,000 veterans have disability claims pending with the @entity31 , including almost 600,000 veterans who have been waiting for more than 125 days for a response			1
those figures represent a more than 613 % increase since president @entity37 's first inauguration in 2009 , when 85,000 veterans were in the backlog for more than 125 days			1
@entity41 benefits were put in place to support service - disabled veterans who , as a result of their injuries , need health care and financial support			2
but our men and women returning home now are n't getting that support			0
they 're asking for help , but so many are not getting it			0
there 's been some recent movement in the right direction			0
since march , the @entity41 has decreased the backlog by 3.2 percent , according to the @entity59 's analysis of @entity60 reporting			0
that the backlog has been reduced for six consecutive weeks is a positive development and reflects the @entity41 's new urgency to fix the backlog problem with new initiatives			0
yet , to eliminate the backlog by its public goal of 2015 , the @entity41 must do far better			0
veterans need the aggressive leadership and decisive action of @entity37 , who has been silent on the backlog , to bring the backlog down to zero			1
this is something that 67 senators and a bipartisan group in the @entity76 are calling for , along with more than a dozen veterans service organizations			2
the president rightfully displayed prompt leadership in responding to another critical issue for service members : military sexual trauma			1
a @entity86 report released in early may revealed that an estimated 26,000 cases of sexual assault occurred last year , a one third increase over the previous year			1
additionally , during this past month , three officers responsible for leading sexual assault prevention efforts have been embroiled in sexual misconduct cases themselves			1
news interactive : 100 faces , 100 hours -- remembering the fallen these incidents have served as a wake - up call for all @entity97			0
we ca n't ask our fellow citizens to put their lives at risk for us if they 're not safe themselves			0
a group of lawmakers , led by sen. @entity104 of @entity105 , is proposing new legislation to combat this problem			2
the @entity108 would remove oversight of sexual assault cases from the chain of command and allow victims to report their assaults to an independent prosecutor			1
this is an important piece of legislation that is quickly gaining bipartisan support and should be implemented immediately			0
it 's sensible and can help change the military 's culture for the better			0
this @entity0 , we also must continue our work to prevent suicides among those who served			2
the numbers are sobering : according to @entity129 reporting , 109 active - duty and reserve servicemen and women have taken their own lives this year			0
among all veterans , 22 veterans commit suicide every day			1
despite what we know about veterans ' suicides , a recent report from the @entity41 inspector general 's office found that about a third of veterans considered to be at high risk for suicide do n't receive the recommended follow - up care after they 've been discharged from @entity41 inpatient mental health care			1
we must continue to push for an expansion of programs that connect veterans to mental health resources while also fighting to erase the stigma that prevents many veterans from seeking mental health care in the first place			2
ensuring that our service members are thoroughly evaluated and properly diagnosed is crucial to ensuring that they 'll be able to cope with , and overcome , the physical and mental injuries they may have sustained while serving our country			2
we need the country to get behind us if we 're going to take care of these men and women who have taken such good care of our country			2
the president 's leadership is essential , but he needs a battalion to lead			0
# @entity171 with veterans this @entity0 and ask a friend to do the same			1
hold hands with your family at 12:01 p.m. et and teach your kids why you 're doing it			0
thank the next person you see in uniform			0
and when @entity0 is over , join our effort to ensure that our elected officials stand with us and take meaningful steps to support veterans and their families			1
honor our men and women who have paid the ultimate sacrifice by doing right by their brothers and sisters among us .			0
