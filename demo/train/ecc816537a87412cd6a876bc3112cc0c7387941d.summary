-- driven by a hard - line faction of conservatives , @entity1 has done something terribly stupid : shutting down the national government			0
most of @entity7 is aghast			1
but it is also just possible that doing something stupid will help us avoid doing something truly dangerous			0
shutdowns are a lousy way to run a government			1
just for starters , this one has cut off services to women and children in need , furloughed hundreds of thousands , further shaken the confidence of the public , sent a shudder through the financial world and created new storm clouds over the economy			1
and once again the world is wondering about our capacity for leadership			0
but all of this damage pales in comparison with the danger posed by a second , lurking threat : a default on our public finances			1
the @entity7 has had 17 government shutdowns since 1977 and has generally recovered well			1
but we have never had a default			1
experts , while not fully certain , are convinced that it could be hugely destructive -- even leading to a worldwide financial meltdown			1
unless @entity41 and the @entity42 get their act together , we could default in less than three weeks			1
but a shutdown could have a silver lining			1
it could be such an electric shock to the political system that it forces the politicians in @entity1 to settle their squabbles before the default deadline			1
what we know from past shutdowns is that not only citizens -- especially older ones dependent on @entity56 and @entity57 -- start raising hell , but so do business and financial leaders who see damage rippling across their economic interests			2
politicians are increasingly seen as villains			0
pressure tends to grow so unbearable that eventually @entity1 finds a solution			0
most of the pressure this time will be directed toward republicans who have misplayed their hand			0
a new poll by @entity0 / @entity74 shows that 46 % of @entity7 blame the shutdown on @entity71 , seeing them as spoiled children			1
thirty six percent blame president @entity79 , and 13 % point fingers at both			1
seasoned @entity71 leaders across the country know that if the shutdown does serious damage , chances of @entity71 picking up @entity85 seats in 2014 and the @entity42 in 2016 could evaporate			2
those leaders will push intensely for a way out			0
but @entity71 are not the only ones who will come under pressure to find a settlement			0
so will @entity94 , starting with president @entity79			1
we expect our presidents to be leaders of all the people , not a single party or ideology			2
we want them to rise above the squabbling and keep us on track			0
the harsh rhetoric that the president has been directing at @entity71 suggests that he is less interested in settlement than unconditional surrender			0
moreover , as @entity71 make their counterarguments , it is becoming increasingly apparent that they have some valid questions			0
is @entity110 truly ready for prime time ? should n't the two parties work together on the tax code ? when is @entity1 going to get serious about overhauling the entitlement programs so they will survive for coming generations ? yes , conservative hard - liners have chosen the wrong place to fight ; arguments over @entity110 are no excuse to shut down the government			2
yes , hard - liners like sen. @entity123 , @entity124 , are creating deeper partisan divides			0
but @entity94 can ill afford to continue rejecting any talks or negotiations			0
now that the shutdown has happened , @entity79 has a fresh opportunity -- indeed a fresh responsibility -- to seize the mantle of leadership and get us out of this mess			1
instead of just blaming the @entity71 , he should call in the leaders of both parties and in @entity138 fashion , keep ' em talking till they get a deal			2
with the shutdown underway , the president has new leverage to say , " look , we are here to negotiate a settlement so that we can reopen the government			2
we are not here to negotiate over a possible default ; i have said all along that i wo n't do that			2
but those of you who have been listening closely know that i have also been saying that i am open to conversations about settling our policy differences so that we can keep the government running			0
" tax reform , entitlement reform and even some tweaking of the @entity110 are on the table now			0
i have only two conditions : i will not accept a gutting of @entity110 -- we settled that at the ballot box in 2012 -- and any settlement here must include a pledge not to let the country go into default			2
so , let 's get started			0
" would it work ? who knows for sure ? but one thing is clear : if enough @entity7 rise up now and pressure politicians in @entity1 to call off this circus , we could not only end this foolishness over a shutdown , but we could also avoid a truly dangerous default			1
and we could hold our heads up again			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1

@entity183 : shutdown would hurt people in need , the @entity7 economy and *markets*
@entity183 : we *'ve* had shutdowns , but never a default , which may lead to global meltdown
default could happen in three weeks , he says , so it would force parties to solve *problems*
@entity183 : shutdown would give @entity79 chance to take charge and get us out of this mess
