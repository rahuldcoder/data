-- the killing of a young giraffe named @entity3 at @entity4 sparked international outrage this weekend			1
on sunday , he was shot with a bolt gun then publicly dissected before being fed to the lions			0
in its defense , the zoo has argued that @entity3 ' death was necessary to protect the genetic diversity of his species			1
it was claimed that to allow @entity3 to take up space that could be used to house another animal with more desirable genetic make - up may hinder conservation breeding programs			0
contraception which required sedation is dangerous and giraffes might die during the procedure			0
as such , @entity3 ' birth could not have been safely prevented			0
@entity3 could not be rehomed because sending him somewhere other than a zoo which was a member of the @entity26 and @entity27 ( @entity28 ) could result in him being sold into a circus , which would be against @entity28 rules			2
in effect , the zoo 's hands were tied , it was implied			1
none of these arguments appear to stand up to scrutiny			1
as the head of the @entity39 endangered species program for giraffes stated in press , @entity3 was not from a rare sub-species			2
given that zoos claim that animals are kept in order to support the conservation of threatened species , it is therefore unclear why any member of @entity3 ' subspecies should be held captive at all			1
zoo staff get death threats it was further confirmed that a contraceptive for giraffes has been developed in the last few years which allows females to be safely injected at a distance thus suggesting that @entity3 ' birth was not inevitable			2
the director of @entity28 supported the stance that @entity3 had to die and encouraged people to consider the " bigger picture			0
" but @entity28 itself is less than consistent in its approach to inbreeding and , indeed , in its concern for the ultimate fate of animals in its member zoos			1
@entity28 and similar zoo bodies discourage member zoos from deliberately breeding white lions ; a practice which is recognized as involving inbreeding in order to perpetuate the unusual white coloring of the animals involved			1
due to the serious welfare implications and the lack of conservation value of inbred animals , breeding of white lions is theoretically not allowed in @entity28 zoos			2
in practice , both @entity85 and @entity86 in the @entity87 breed white lions			0
both are @entity28 members and yet , despite vociferously supporting the killing of @entity3 to prevent the same problem , a blind eye has been turned by @entity28 to the persistent inbreeding of other species in its zoos			1
white lions are , perhaps tellingly , a great crowd pleaser			0
in 2012 @entity85 were revealed to have sent four white lions to a circus trainer , who sent them on to a @entity102 circus			0
that the safari park remains an @entity28 member means that the rules on sending animals to @entity108 collections are not consistently applied			0
despite this , no exception was made for @entity3			0
in fact , rather than @entity3 being a tragic exception , the killing of animals considered to be surplus to requirements by zoos is something which is common in the industry			1
a 2003 study suggested that there are around 7,500 animals deemed " surplus " in @entity39 zoos at any one time			1
whilst it can not be undone , @entity3 ' death has served an important purpose in shining a spotlight on a practice which is normally kept well - hidden from public view			0
as long as there are zoos , there will be unwanted animals			1
and as long as there are unwanted animals , more like @entity3 will be killed			1
it has long been recognised that conservation success is achieved not in city centre zoos or safari parks , but in natural habitats			2
we would urge anyone with a passion for conservation to support effective in situ efforts which are truly making a positive impact on species conservation			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			2

@entity4 zoo 's defense of killing a giraffe does not stand up to scrutiny , **writes** @entity151
a blind eye has been turned to the inbreeding of other species , she says
@entity163 : killing animals considered a surplus by zoos is common
as long as there are zoos , there will be unwanted animals , she **writes**
