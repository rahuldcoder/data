-- @entity1 voted friday to approve a referendum on constitutional reforms that would weaken the king 's powers and boost those of the government			1
the referendum was approved by 98.49 % of voters , the country 's interior minister said			1
despite a particularly warm day , more than 70 % of the country 's 13 million registered voters turned out to decide on the referendum , interior minister @entity11 said			1
" i voted yes because i agree with the proposed changes , " said @entity15 of @entity16			2
" there is still a lot of work to be done , like appointing of a completely new government , but i am very hopeful			0
" king @entity23 announced the referendum in a rare address to the nation last month , after a series of unprecedented protests swept the @entity30 country			1
under the referendum , voters are empowered to select a prime minister , ending the longstanding practice in which the king has selected his own man for the job			1
the prime minister has tended to take his lead from the sovereign on key matters of state			1
over recent months , thousands of young @entity1 have taken to the streets , inspired by the @entity44			1
the youth - based february 20 movement wants jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies			0
it had urged its supporters to boycott the referendum on the constitution , saying it fails to meet their demands			2
the countries biggest political parties , including the @entity64 ( @entity63 ) , the @entity57 ( @entity58 ) and the conservative @entity60 party , had asked their supporters to vote " yes " to the proposed changes			2
" although this project may seem to some non-revolutionary , it has the advantage to make the parties face their responsibilities			0
it forces them to make their own cultural revolution , " said industry member @entity73 , a member of the @entity57 party			0
the revamped draft constitution will make officials more accountable , the @entity82 in @entity83 more dynamic and will give the government greater powers , the 47 - year - old king said when he announced the referendum on june 17			1
the new prime minister would have new powers in decision - making and in day - to - day management -- relieving the king of a number of duties and aligning the style of management along the lines followed by some @entity98 countries			1
in an example of power sharing , the draft constitution empowers the prime minister to dissolve the @entity102 , and stresses that the king shall consult him before announcing the dissolution of @entity82			1
" it specifies the conditions to be observed in each case in order to ensure the separation of powers as well as balance and cooperation between the branches , " the king said			0
" the idea is to establish democratic institutions where all active parties participate and bring in prosperity			0
" under the reforms , @entity1 will also have an independent judiciary and provide equal rights for women			1
analysts , however , question whether the proposed change will prove sufficient			2
the reforms " appear to be genuine , " wrote @entity125 , an international affairs fellow at the @entity126			0
but " the security apparatus , cabinet positions and religious appointments remain under the finger of the king			0
" " for a country that has been accused of human right abuses in the past , these reforms for some do not go far enough , " he added			0
" the king may well have succeeded in staying ahead of the protest that has led to the demise of the regimes in @entity146 and @entity147 and plunged @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , and @entity151 into turmoil and violence , " said @entity138 , director of the @entity140 program at the @entity141			0
" whether this is just a short - lived victory in the first skirmish of a long battle or a turning point on the road to transforming @entity1 into the @entity161 world 's first constitutional monarchy will depend not only on how the king acts in the coming months , but also on the capacity and willingness of @entity1 political organizations to build on the opportunities the constitution offers them , " @entity138 wrote			2
" it may also depend to some extent on the persistence of a protest movement that has so far not been able to mobilize the huge crowds seen in @entity146 and @entity147 , " she stressed			0
