-- ngos can be funny , at least that 's what @entity2 is banking on			2
as a filmmaker in @entity5 , @entity6 , he was constantly privy to stories of hilarious ineptitude by supposedly do - good organizations			1
" @entity5 has a large development community , and i realized it 's never actually been talked about in the context of comedy			2
i thought it would be good to bring the two worlds together , " he says			2
thus , he was inspired to create " @entity15 , " a mockumentary - style show about the inner workings of the @entity1 world			1
characters include @entity20 , the cocky @entity21 brought in as the new country director at the @entity6 field office for " aid for aid " ( the organization 's mission is a little unclear )			2
there 's the substance - addicted former interim director ( her " usual " consists of " a bottle of 75 % proof vodka , six @entity33 and a crack pipe " ) and a finance director who refers to posting pictures on " the @entity37			1

" a lot of what we have portrayed has actually occurred , but since it 's a comedy , we exaggerated to get good laughs			0
" a good deal of inside knowledge is provided by @entity48 , the actor who plays @entity20			0
in a previous incarnation , @entity48 actually managed an @entity1 , a job , he admits , for which he was under qualified			1
" i 'm not even a good actor , let alone an @entity1 worker , " he jokes			1
making the switch , he says , was easier than one might imagine			0
" there are only about three white actors in @entity6			0
when the role was written for a white guy , i guess i was privileged to be one , " he says			0
in truth , though , @entity60 's non-profit experience has proved useful to the show , especially in developing his character			1
" there are about 20 real - life ' @entity65 ' i 've come across in my time [ in @entity5 ]			1
he 's an amalgamation of different despicable elements , " he says			0
since the episodes have gone live , @entity2 says several @entity1 workers have reached out to share their more ludicrous stories			1
prime examples include the charity that auctioned off a permit to hunt a black rhino in @entity76 for $ 350,000 -- money raised to conserve the black rhino species -- and an ngo that spent money sending a technologically challenged motivational speaker to a @entity82 village to teach the local school children it skills			0

@entity2 used @entity92 to fund the pilot for the show , and is relying on donations through the show 's website ( all pledges enable donors to watch the first two episodes -- the only ones produced at the moment ) to finish the season			1
the show has proved popular			1
so far , the trailer has garnered nearly 92,000 views on @entity107 alone			0
at one point , it was the most popular clip in @entity6			0
somewhat bafflingly , @entity2 has also received funding from an @entity1 , begging the question : what do they get out of it ? " we asked the same question , and they told us they 've been looking for a way to start a dialogue regarding certain ngos that do n't necessarily behave themselves			1
they thought comedy would be a great way to highlight those issues of credibility and accountability , " @entity2 says			0
still , the team point out that ultimately , their goals for making the show are not particularly lofty			1
" i guess the main reason i chose this subject matter was because i thought the stories were absurd , and would make for good television			1
as a producer , my primary goal was entertainment , " notes @entity2			2
" we 're not pushing to make changes ; we 're not qualified for that			0
you can say you recognize the funny part -- whether its ngos that are funny or the people in them -- but i do n't feel anyone doing this had high - minded ideals , " adds @entity48			2
while he is in talks with a pan-african distribution company , ultimately , @entity2 is hoping the show will appeal to an international audience			2
" ideally , we 'd like to be on platforms like @entity156			0
or maybe we could co-produce this with you guys at @entity0 ? " he asks			0
