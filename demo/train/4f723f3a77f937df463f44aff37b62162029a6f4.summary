momentum appears to be building for a breakthrough deal on @entity3 's nuclear program , with top diplomats flocking to the site of ongoing talks			1
hours after a @entity9 official said a deal could be reached " as soon as tonight , " discussions ended friday night , a senior @entity7 said			2
they are set to resume saturday morning			1
by that point , @entity14 secretary of state @entity13 and @entity16 foreign secretary @entity15 should both be in @entity18			1
they 'll have company in the form of @entity23 foreign minister @entity22 , who headed to the @entity25 city friday night according to an @entity27 diplomatic source , and @entity29 foreign minister @entity28 , according to his ministry 's website			1
they all join @entity34 foreign minister @entity33 as well as @entity27 foreign policy chief @entity35 and @entity3 foreign minister @entity36 , who have been the key players in the latest round of discussions			1
together , these diplomats represent all five permanent members of the @entity42 plus @entity43 -- together known as the @entity44 -- which has been negotiating with @entity3 about their nuclear program			2
the hastily rearranged plans indicate that these @entity18 talks are continuing past their scheduled conclusion friday , though the hopes clearly go beyond just talking			2
after talking to @entity55 and the @entity14 negotiating team , @entity13 " made the decision to travel here with the hope that an agreement will be reached , " @entity7 spokeswoman @entity50 said			1
the @entity9 powers have been working toward an agreement to roll back @entity3 's suspected march toward a nuclear weapon			1
on the other side , @entity61 has been looking for loosening of the economic sanctions that are strangling its economy			0
@entity36 said friday there is wide agreement except for a couple of points , the semi-official @entity66 reported			0
" it should become clear today if we want to reach to a conclusion in the ongoing round of talks or further negotiation events are needed , " @entity36 said , according to @entity66			0
" numerically speaking , perhaps 90 % of progress has been made , but there ( are ) one or two issues which are of great significance			0
" a major sticking point to an agreement has been @entity3 's right to enrich uranium , officials involved in the discussions said			1
@entity3 wants the explicit right to do so to be part of the deal -- which would likely extend six months and ideally be a precursor to a more sweeping pact -- diplomats told @entity93			2
western powers , on the other hand , prefer ambiguity on this matter : they do n't want that point written into the agreement , but if @entity3 states its right to enrich uranium , the @entity100 wo n't dispute it , the diplomats said			1
talks in context the latest round of talks comes as a change of leadership in @entity3 has changed that country 's priorities			2
president @entity111 , who was elected earlier this year , has made lifting tough economic sanctions against his country a priority			0
during a visit to the @entity117 in september , @entity111 's moderate diplomatic approach raised hopes in the @entity100 of a thaw in relations with @entity61 and progress in negotiations on its nuclear program			0
despite the sanctions against it , @entity3 today has 19,000 centrifuges and is building more advanced ones , according to @entity128 , a nuclear policy expert at the @entity130			2
at the same time , the sanctions have crippled @entity3 's economy			1
most world powers believe @entity3 is realistically at least a year away from building a nuclear weapon , @entity128 said			2
@entity3 insists it seeks to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes			0
the international community led by @entity138 , the @entity14 , @entity23 and others demands that @entity61 dismantle its ability to enrich uranium and other technology needed to develop nuclear weapons			1
@entity3 recently signed a deal with the @entity145 that agrees to give the @entity42 nuclear watchdog agency access to long - unseen nuclear sites , including a heavy - water reactor in @entity149			0
controversial approach @entity111 's new approach has helped bring the parties back to the table , but any deal will have its critics			0
@entity138 , the @entity14 ' closest ally in the region , staunchly opposes the tentative plan			0
" it 's a bad deal -- an exceedingly bad deal , " prime minister @entity159 told @entity93 this week			0
@entity159 opposes lifting some sanctions now without getting further concessions to ensure @entity3 would be unable to continue with uranium enrichment and other steps			2
some @entity14 lawmakers are n't sold on the new plan			0
on tuesday , a bipartisan group of six senators urged the administration to reject the proposed deal with @entity3 and accept only an agreement that better dismantles @entity3 's ability to develop nuclear weapons			1
but president @entity174 said the current sanctions put in place during his administration had forced @entity3 to the negotiating table because of economic contraction and frozen oil revenue			0
he said the proposed deal would " open up the spigot a little bit " on some of the frozen revenue while leaving in place the bulk of the most effective sanctions involving @entity3 oil exports and banking			0
but @entity174 also stressed that all options , including military strikes on @entity3 's nuclear facilities , remained on the table as far as the @entity14 was concerned			1
@entity14 national security adviser @entity193 said the plan would benefit the global community			0
" the international community would have unprecedented access to @entity3 's nuclear facilities and full transparency into what they 're doing , so they would n't have the ability to sneak out or break out , " @entity196 said .			1

official : talks end for the night , will resume saturday morning
@entity29 , @entity23 , @entity16 , @entity14 , @entity34 , @entity3 foreign ministers head to @entity18
spokeswoman : @entity13 going there " with the hope that an agreement will be reached "
