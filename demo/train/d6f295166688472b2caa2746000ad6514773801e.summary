-- we now live in an age when glamorous , hey - look - at - me belters so dominate the pop - music firmament that you can barely tell who 's doing the shouting			1
so it may be hard for some to remember -- or imagine -- what it was like to behold @entity12 for the first time			1
not even your first taste of snow , your first meaningful kiss , your first encounter with one of the seven natural wonders quite aligns with the experience -- unless as some rough combination of all three			2
as many who grieved over @entity12 's shocking death yesterday at 48 will tell you , this first encounter would have taken place somewhere in the middle of the " @entity29 " years			1
indeed , she seemed destined for greatness even before she released her first eponymous album for @entity33 ' @entity32 in 1985			2
the word was out years before that @entity12 had the presence , the pedigree and -- goodness knows -- the pipes to be something unprecedented , remarkable , even historic			1
daughter of the great soul - and - gospel vocalist @entity42 , cousin to both @entity43 and @entity44 and goddaughter to @entity46 , @entity12 's family background seemed a magically appropriate fusion of both the grit and the glamour of late - 20th - century african - american pop music			1
you could n't find a more auspicious template for great expectations			2
and for a while , she fulfilled those prospects -- and then some			0
remember the insouciant swagger she showed in both the video and the recording of " @entity61 ? " the effortless push - pull command of romantic lyrics she exhibited in " @entity65 " ? the skyscraping , come - to - meeting intensity she brought to " @entity69 " ? they were all on " @entity12 , " the debut album that answered just about every question we could have about her before we could calm down enough to come up with any questions at all			1
here was a singer blessed with both her godmother 's hair - raising vocal agility and @entity81 ' physical magnetism			0
being demure can make you alluring and enigmatic			0
having powerful sounds at your command can make you frightening and fascinating			0
put them together and you had a pop phenomenon capable of breaching all manner of audience boundaries whether of race , age or geographic origin			1
at her peak she had enough confidence to win both the rockers and the disco crowd with the white - lightning rave , " @entity95 ( who loves me )			0
" she covered @entity104 's " @entity108 " with such overpowering force that she all but assumed ownership of the song			0
there seemed nothing she could n't do , even acquit herself more than decently as a movie actress in " @entity112 " ( 1992 ) , " @entity113 " ( 1995 ) and " @entity114 " ( 1997 )			0
when someone can do anything , it 's not unusual for others to wonder if she 's doing too much -- or trying too hard			0
those of us who were mesmerized by her prodigious breakthroughs wondered how long she could keep it up , especially under the glare of multimedia celebrityhood			0
some of us might have preferred that she take a hiatus , a brief withdrawal from the spotlight to protect her voice and , especially , her psyche from gossip , glitz and , yes , controlled substances			2
but when people demand that you deliver a knockout " @entity138 " at a @entity139 while a war 's going on , when your life literally becomes a lowbrow real - life sitcom ( only without the laughs ) and when there are hundreds , thousands and millions of little - girls - with - big - voices who look to you as a role model , there 's not a whole lot of elbow room to turn the dial to " slow " and contemplate ways of adjusting your art and your life to time 's insistent demands			2
we do n't yet know the circumstances surrounding @entity12 's death			1
and we are n't going to dwell on whatever personal trials accumulated over the years and their cumulative effects			0
there 's plenty of time for that -- and a lot of dreary tell - all books to come			2
we 'd rather not think about it			0
we have a simpler need : to remember when there was literally no one else like @entity12 in this world -- and how much poorer the world would have been without her			1
