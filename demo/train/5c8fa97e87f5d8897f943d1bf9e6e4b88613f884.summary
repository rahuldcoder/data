-- last fall , you could typically find my mom teaching , mentoring her students , nagging me to study for the @entity6 , taking my sister to soccer practice or cooking dinner			1
she took on one new responsibility as well : driving another mother and her son to and from the @entity15 hospital , where the son was undergoing treatment for lymphoma			1
@entity19 had never met them before last fall			2
yet , when she heard that they were new to the area , she gave them support and gained friendship			2
this type of behavior is not out of the ordinary for my mom			2
when one of her colleagues in @entity31 got diagnosed with breast cancer , @entity19 organized a food drop - off for the family			2
when she saw that a bright student was failing her class , she took him aside and bought him a textbook after learning he could n't afford them			2
this @entity42 , she learned that a group of students could not go home for the break			2
@entity19 invited them over for a home - cooked dinner			0
the day after that @entity42 dinner , my mom was diagnosed for the second time with acute myelogenus leukemia ( @entity52 ) , a cancer of the blood -- after eight years in remission			1
now , she desperately needs a bone marrow transplant as soon as possible			1
@entity57 found a match , but others likely wo n't be as lucky due to certain genetic markers , her match will almost certainly come from someone from her birthplace -- @entity64 , in southern @entity65			0
but @entity67 donors of @entity65 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 or @entity74 descent are some of the least - represented groups in the @entity76			1
some campaigns recruiting @entity77 suggest that a @entity67 like my mom has a 1 in 20,000 chance of finding a match , while the chance is 1 in 8 for @entity83			1
when the news of my mother 's illness became known , it seemed like everyone we had ever met -- and even people we had n't -- were asking how they could help us			1
our friends in @entity92 set up an internet - based food delivery system			0
our friends in @entity31 flooded us with care packages			0
once we learned that @entity19 needed a transplant , her former students , friends , and colleagues -- even those she did not know personally -- started setting up bone marrow drives around the country			1
on december 27 , we got a belated but incredible @entity103 present -- @entity19 's doctors had found 12 potential bone marrow matches ! the drives stopped , and we breathed a sigh of relief			1
it did n't occur to us that none of the 12 potential matches would work out , or that people would back out of donating their bone marrow			1
so we were shocked when we got the heartbreaking news that half of the potential donors had refused to follow up			1
the other six did , but were ruled out upon further testing			0
why i donated my bone marrow once more , those who care about @entity19 stepped up to bring us hope			1
they launched a campaign site , @entity126 , and a @entity128 site that has been seen by more than 1 million people ( including more than 60,000 in @entity65 ) and received more than 3,500 " likes " so far			0
they also created a video ( @entity126 ) that had 4,500 views in its first three days on @entity135 and more than 100,000 views through the @entity137			0
more than 150 drives targeting @entity77 were organized all over the world , held at colleges , temples , companies and festivals			0
thousands of people signed up to be on the @entity146 registry			0
although we have not yet found a match for my mom , at least six of these people have proved to be potential matches for other people desperately needing a transplant			1
two weeks ago , we found out that @entity19 had a match from @entity65			0
but two days later , we found out that donor , too , was unwilling to donate			0
although donation is generally safe and painless , the chief barriers are psychological and cultural			1
there is a diversity of opinions about biological donation across cultures , with some more traditional ones considering the practice taboo			0
this might be one reason why @entity65 , the world 's second - largest nation , has a bone marrow registry of 39,000 people , according to @entity170 , a nonprofit organization which drives and maintains registries worldwide			1
in comparison , there are 10.5 million donors on the @entity175 ' @entity76			2
of those , only 208,000 , or nearly 2 % , are @entity67			1
in fact , we learned that the potential match two weeks ago -- a young man from @entity65 -- had been talked out of donating by his parents			2
why many would - be bone marrow , blood stem cell donors back out being a bone marrow donor is easy			1
screening is a simple swab of the cheek , and if you are found to be a match , donation is usually a simple outpatient procedure called @entity193 collection			0
the donor receives injections for a few days before the donation to boost their own blood - forming cells			0
these new cells are then collected through an iv and filtered from the rest of the blood			0
my dream is to give @entity19 the gift of life -- in the form of a bone marrow donor			1
sadly , neither my sister nor i are matches			0
so i 'll settle for challenging everyone who reads this to get on the @entity211			0
if you are already a member , i salute you , but i challenge you to spread the word , so that my mom -- or someone else 's mom , dad , sibling , child or friend -- can receive the gift of life			2
you can register at @entity222			0
if you would like to try to donate for @entity19 , please submit the code " nalini " so that your swab kits can be expedited .			0
