-- it was one of those mom moments , one of those " no matter how much you try to plan and do for your children , you ca n't think of everything " realizations			1
( if you have kids , you know exactly what i mean			0
) i received the advisory about @entity14 's " @entity16 " plan , part of the national " @entity16 " scheduled for thursday			1
( @entity14 is @entity0 's parent company			0
) here in @entity18 , children ages 8 to 13 will try their hand at being a television anchor by reading from a teleprompter ; interview @entity0 anchors and reporters and get a tour of @entity0 's studios and newsrooms			0
it would be a dream - come - true kind of day for my oldest daughter , who just turned 8 , and already seems way too comfortable with a microphone in her hand			0
( " what about being a doctor ? " my journalist husband and i joke when we suspect our gal might follow in our footsteps			0
) but then came the realization that i had committed to another event the same day			1
i 'll be moderating a panel of amazing women , which is a wonderful thing to do -- but it means i wo n't be able to take my daughters to work , something i 've tried to do nearly every year			1
i love the whole concept behind the day , giving our children a chance to see what we do when we 're not with them while learning about careers that can help influence their professional paths			1
while my scheduling snafu will likely put me in the doghouse at home for a short time , it does eliminate a challenge i encountered each year , the same one faced by more than 37 million @entity61 who are participating in the 21st annual day of parents taking their children to work : how to make the day fun and interesting for children , yet realistic ? having our kids think every day is a party does n't communicate the career aspect of the event -- and no workplace needs children wreaking havoc on the business day			1
a meltdown in a grocery store is downright cringe - worthy			0
the same such outburst outside your cubicle ? exponentially more uncomfortable			0
you can imagine the eye rolls now and the conversation around the water cooler , " what kind of parent lets their kid do that ? " so , in honor of my fellow parents , i put together five tips , almost a survival guide , to help parents , their sons and daughters get the most out of this special day			1
make it memorable this does n't mean you have to turn your office environment into a middle school dance party or a visit to @entity102 , but you do want to make sure your child gets something out of the experience			1
having your son or daughter sit next to you in your cubicle while you work on a computer and they play video games is not much different than what they could do at home			0
" you do n't bring a child there to babysit , " said @entity115 , a communications specialist with the @entity116			1
" we heard where people bring the children when they 're like 5 and 6 months old			2
i ca n't think of a horror story much worse than having to do a job and babysit " an infant , he said			2
plan , plan , plan many companies will do the planning for you , scheduling a series of events throughout the day to keep the children busy and engaged			2
" whoever is setting up your program has to set it up so the stress is not on the parent to babysit ( and ) there are things for the young people to do throughout the day , " @entity115 said			2
" it 'll make the young people feel better			0
it 'll make the parents feel better too			2
" if no one is doing the planning for you , do it yourself			0
schedule some meaningful events for the day -- introduce your children to your colleagues and have them talk about what they do , have your children attend different meetings with you , show them how you are trying to solve a problem , or have them give you input to help you solve a problem			1
as with all parenting , planning goes a long way			0
do n't lose track of them this sounds obvious , but it 's easy to see how it can happen			0
a parent gets busy with a project or a long conference call , gets distracted and then within minutes their son or daughter is wandering the hallways			0
not a problem if you 've explained to your children what 's expected of them and where they need to be at all times , but somewhat tense if they accidentally walk into a conference room that just happens to be where your boss is holding a big meeting			2
how do you spell stressful ? parents should explain to children that normal business is operating while they are there			2
@entity115 suggests telling them : " we expect you to behave like you would in somebody else 's home			0
this is not a runaway activity			0
" to keep the anxieties in check , have a plan on what your children can do with you and without you , and where they are expected to be throughout the day			1
do n't have your kids do your job if you thought this was your chance to get out of coming up with ideas for the big management meeting , or entering the data for the end of quarter reports , think again ! " this is not a day to put children to work , " @entity115 said			1
the goal , of course , is for them to see what you do , and who you work with , and to get a sense of whether your career is one they 'd like to pursue down the road			0
" the important thing is to make them feel that they 're having not just a free day , but they 're having a learning experience that will be meaningful , yet not too stressful to them			1
snack time putting in a day 's work entitles any child some kind of treat when it 's all over			1
as you enjoy a snack together , ask your child what they liked about the day and what they did n't , and what they learned by going to work with you			1
their answers will not only help you figure out how to make next year 's " @entity16 " even better			1
they might even help you realize what you love about your job and what you do n't			0
are you participating in " @entity16 " ? chime in in the comments below or tell @entity252 on @entity253 and @entity254 on @entity255 .			2

millions are expected to join in " @entity16 "
this is the 21st year for the annual event that asks parents take their children to work
for many parents , the challenge is how to make the day fun and meaningful
