@entity0 -- a day before embarking on a trip to @entity4 , president @entity2 described his planned talks with @entity4 leaders as discussions among equals			1
president @entity2 refuses to criticize @entity4 leaders			1
" times have changed , " @entity2 told @entity9 wednesday			1
referring to his planned meeting later this week with @entity13 president @entity12 , he said , " my relationship with president @entity12 is one of two leaders who both have big countries , that we are trying to solve problems and create opportunities for our people and we should be partners			1
" there 's no senior partner or junior partner			0
" @entity2 and @entity12 are among leaders scheduled to attend the @entity26 in @entity27			1
@entity2 refused to criticize the leaders of @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 , who have taken measures to change their constitutions to extend their holds on power			2
" i think it 's important for the @entity36 not to tell other countries how to structure their democratic practices and what should be contained in their constitutions , " he said			1
" it 's up to the people of those countries to make a decision about how they want to structure their affairs			2
" asked how he plans to interact with @entity29 president @entity46 , a fierce critic of the @entity36 who once described former president @entity47 as the devil , @entity2 offered no criticism			1
" look , he 's the leader of his country and he 'll be one of many people that i will have an opportunity to meet			0
" though he said he believes the @entity36 has a leadership role to play in the region , @entity2 qualified that role , saying , " we also recognize that other countries have important contributions and insights			1
we want to listen and learn as well as talk , and that approach , i think , of mutual respect and finding common interests , is one that ultimately will serve everybody			1
" asked about @entity69 , @entity2 , who recently eased restrictions on travel and sending money to the island , offered a prod and a carrot to @entity77			2
" what we 're looking for is some signal that there are going to be changes in how @entity69 operates that assures that political prisoners are released , that people can speak their minds freely , that they can travel , that they can write and attend church and do the things that people throughout the hemisphere can do and take for granted , " he said			0
" and if there is some sense of movement on those fronts in @entity69 , then i think we can see a further thawing of relations and further changes			0
" @entity2 sought to distance his administration from that of his predecessor , noting that he plans to close the detention center at @entity101 , @entity69 , where " some of the practices of enhanced interrogation techniques , i think ran counter to @entity4 values and @entity4 traditions			1
" he said his team has spoken with the @entity109 government about a @entity109 judge 's call for an investigation into the role of @entity47 administration officials in the detention of five @entity109 at @entity101			0
but he did not dwell on his predecessor 's legacy			0
" i 'm a strong believer that it is important to look forward and not backward and to remind ourselves that we do have very real security threats out there			0
" though the @entity36 image abroad may have suffered in recent years , " there 's a reason why there are consistently so many immigrants to our country from @entity4 , " he said			2
@entity2 lauded @entity131 president @entity130 , with whom he is to meet thursday in @entity132 , as having done " an outstanding and heroic job in dealing with what is a big problem right now along the borders with the drug cartels			2
" he vowed that the @entity36 can be counted on to help			0
" we are going to be dealing not only with drug interdiction coming north , but also working on helping to curb the flow of cash and guns going south , " @entity2 said			0
@entity2 described himself as " a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform , " and said he has met with the @entity145 " to try to shape an agenda that can move through @entity147			0

@entity2 heading to @entity26 this week in @entity27 and @entity149
