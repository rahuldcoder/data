-- even when a drone 's small , turned off , unarmed and resting on a table in a coffee shop , it can make people uneasy			2
that discomfort could change in the next few years as the airborne gadgets become commonplace and more people buy personal drones			1
startups are already popping up with different takes on design , uses and price			0
the latest aerial offering is the @entity15 by @entity16 , a midrange drone for photographers who do n't want to mess around with additional complicated technology			1
@entity21 and unremarkable - looking , the @entity15 is simple to put together -- just snap in the four propellers and two pieces of landing gear			1
it can hold a @entity26 , the drone photographer 's camera of choice because of its light weight , or other lightweight cameras and camcorders			0
" this is not designed to be a toy ; this is a tool for the average person to use , " said @entity33 , founder of @entity15 , who showed off his creation last week in , yes , a coffee shop in @entity36			1
the consumer drone market is still wide open for newcomers due to a combination of tangled @entity45 restrictions , high price tags , privacy concerns and a bad reputation			1
airborne photography is the most popular consumer use for drones , and the @entity53 line from @entity54 currently dominates that field			1
@entity16 wants to take on the slick white and red @entity53 drones with a slightly less expensive design and some quirky features			2
the @entity15 's landing gear can be pulled up in flight so that a camera is able to capture a true 360 - degree view without obstructions			1
pilots can control the device from a smartphone or tablet , pointing to any direction on a map to set a route			0
the apps can also control the camera position and track flight hours			0
when it 's not flying , the @entity15 is programmed to speak when turned on but not in the air			1
it spits out a mixture of warnings ( such as your gps is offline ) , explanations and casual chitchat in a @entity84 accent or voice of your choosing			0
" sometimes it has a little bit of a dry wit and sometimes it has more of a sarcastic sense of humor , " @entity33 said			0
the @entity45 is slowly working on clearing commercial unmanned aerial vehicles , or @entity93 , for use			1
( it 's expected to announce details by the end of this year			0
) last week , the agency issued an exemption that will allow a handful of tv and movie companies to capture aerial footage with drones , but regular people are still on a short leash			1
so to help consumers stay out of trouble , the @entity15 is also programmed to obey the law			1
amateur drone users ca n't go above 400 feet , and the devices ca n't be used for commercial purposes without express permission			2
@entity15 limits use of the device accordingly			1
like many @entity93 entrepreneurs , @entity33 comes from an aerospace background			0
he worked for @entity117 , the company that makes @entity118 , for six years			2
@entity16 now has seven employees , mostly aerospace engineers and one biomedical engineer			0
at its 800 - square - foot office in @entity123 , the company prints out drone prototypes on industrial - grade 3 - d printers and tests them in a 10 - by - 10 - foot cage			2
on wednesday , it kicked off an @entity128 campaign to get attention and funds for the first run of 1,000 drones			2
these early devices go for $ 480 to $ 1,200 and are scheduled to ship in early 2015			0
@entity33 said the @entity134 will cost between $ 800 and $ 1,700 when it becomes more widely available after the first run			0
the @entity15 is meant primarily for photographers , but @entity33 said he hopes to find other uses			1
" we 're working with a researcher who wants to create a metal detection halo			0
he wants to swarm these thing together to find landmines			0
" @entity143 reveals secret drone delivery tests			0

the @entity15 is a new ready - to - fly tool for aerial photographers
*software* ensures the drones do n't break the law by *adhering* to @entity45 regulations
over the next few years , drones could become just another common consumer gadget
