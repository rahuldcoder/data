-- give @entity1 some credit : she 's ridden this ceaseless wave of publicity all the way to @entity6			1
her latest album , " @entity8 , " is at the top of @entity10 in 70 countries , and the expectation is that she 's going to arrive at the top of @entity15 's 200 album chart as well			1
while her success could be brushed off with the industry motto " all publicity is good publicity , " those who 've closely watched the 20 - year - old 's development say that 's not the whole story			1
in @entity0 's " @entity23 of @entity1 , " which examines @entity1 ' music , message and personal journey , insiders who 've intimately come to know the singer / actress say that her transition from a childhood of atvs and cheerleading to adult superstardom was no accident			1
instead , @entity1 has executed her transformation with total control			1
@entity38 , music editor for the @entity39 , tells @entity0 she gives @entity1 " a lot of credit for her own street smarts and her own understanding of what consumers want			1
" after all , @entity38 says , " there was a time when people thought @entity1 would never be on @entity49 , because @entity50 was too squeaky clean			1
well ... she 's certainly turned that around			2
" and how did she do that ? by systematically shedding her reputation as a tween celebrity			0
cyrus herself has never been " squeaky clean " -- even before she turned 18 , her actual image was occasionally at odds with the image those parents paying for tickets to " @entity61 " concerts expected			0
according to @entity62 , the @entity63 writer who went skydiving and to a tattoo shop with @entity1 for @entity63 's recent cover story , believes the beginning of this transition happened at 17 , when @entity1 was filming the comedy " lol " in @entity69 with @entity70			1
" she said that was the first time that she was really ... basically by herself			0
there were other ( s ) -- obviously the rest of the cast and crew was around -- but she was kind of living on her own , " @entity74 said			0
" she would go out to clubs , which she 'd never really done before			0
i think it was probably easier for her to be anonymous or kind of fly under the radar in @entity69 a little bit			0
she said she learned a lot from ( @entity70 ) , and i think she got into hip - hop more up there			2
" while " lol " failed to make a dent in @entity1 ' rep , a certain haircut that same year definitely did			1
in august 2012 , the singer made one of the biggest statements a young celebrity can make : she drastically changed her look with a super-short , platinum blonde haircut , a clear departure from anything she 'd done before			0
according to @entity100 , an executive producer on @entity1 ' old show , " @entity61 , " that sort of risk - taking is nothing new			1
" the thing that makes you wonder , ' what 's she gon na do next , ? ' i 've been asking that about her since the day i met her , " @entity100 said			2
photos : child star transformations when @entity1 was first auditioning for the part , " she was the least likely person to get this job , " @entity100 continued			1
but with her combination of vocal talent and that unpredictability , she wound up winning the creative team over to her side			0
" there was something about her that was so alive and so fearless , and that 's what we all talked about in the room , " @entity100 said			2
" that 's part of who she is			2
and it 's part of , as an artist , what she probably needs to be			2
it means that she 's going to , at times , make mistakes			2
but i think she 's strong enough to get through it all and come out the other side			2
" of course , as @entity1 has peeled off the layers of adolescence -- along with several layers of her actual clothes -- many have " tsked " at her seemingly new image : there are the references to marijuana ( super lemon haze is said to be her strain of choice ) ; the sexually suggestive music videos ; the @entity157 © , semi-nude photos - not to mention her " @entity159 " video - both courtesy of @entity162			1
and then there 's that tongue			2
but , @entity62 suggests , " the things that we see that seem crazy are very calculatedly crazy			0
@entity169 ( @entity170 ) phrased it in a very long text message that he wrote to her : ' you 're not a train wreck , you 're the train pulling everyone else along			0
' ( @entity1 ) seems to be totally together and with it and knows exactly what 's going on			1
" @entity38 agrees , noting that it is n't easy to simply wake up and decide to aim for the top of the hot singles chart			0
" that requires a great deal of planning to say , ' here we are in 2007 , by 2010 - 2011 , we want to be on top 40 radio			0
it takes four years to develop an artist like that , " she said			0
" and that 's what we 've seen			0
we 've seen her development			0
and it 's not an accident ; it is very strategic			1
" in order to build any longevity , @entity38 explains , " we need to see her go through these musical phases and these stylistic changes , too			0
we can look back at any ( act ) -- @entity202 or ' @entity203 -- and laugh at what they wore , what they sang			0
but at the moment , it was perfect for what the audience was looking for			0
( @entity1 ) knows what her audience wants			1
right now , @entity1 knows that her audience wants honesty -- sometimes of the naked variety			1
and with " @entity61 " getting farther in her rear view , frank vulnerability is what the pop star can offer			1
with " @entity8 " and all the changes it has brought , @entity1 told @entity0 that she 's now " able to be just more honest as an artist			1
and that 's really what my record is about			0
