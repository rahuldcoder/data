@entity19 's " @entity20 , " for instance , had 9.2 million viewers ; @entity24 's " revenge " had 6.7 million			1
( all these totals will increase once several days of digital video recorder viewership is factored in			0

but the season four premiere affirms that " @entity1 " is making history for the network			1
