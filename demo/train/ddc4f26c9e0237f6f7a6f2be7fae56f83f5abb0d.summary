-- after months of speculation and rumors , the @entity1 has finally been revealed , and yes it is more powerful that you could have ever imagined			1
likely to be one of " the " phones of the year , the new handset offers just about all the technology you could wish for in a smartphone			1
there 's the face recognition , the large screen , and plenty of other features that you 'll be dying to show off to your friends and colleagues at every opportunity			0
read more : @entity20 unveils @entity1 smartphone with face , voice recognition for @entity20 it means they truly have a flagship device that can be sung about from the top of the mountain			1
it 's a device that has the power and capabilities to take on the @entity31 , the next @entity32 , and pretty much any phone that comes out over the course of the rest of the year			1
things could change , but it 's hard to imagine anyone aside from @entity39 with the capability to create a viable challenger to what @entity20 has produced			0
great news , you might say			0
it will sell by the bucket load , and become the de-facto phone for all replacing the @entity32 and all that get in its way			2
the problem the @entity1 will likely face , stopping it becoming the biggest - selling phone of the year , is that all this power , all this might , all this expertise , is likely to be too much for the people who just want a phone			1
the @entity32 is successful not because it features the best screen - it does n't ; not because it features the best design - it does n't ; and not because it uses any of the latest cutting technology - it does n't do that either , but because it is the perfect phone for everyone			1
give the @entity32 to a 5 year old and they 'll be able to use it			2
give the @entity32 to a grandparent and they 'll be able to use it			0
i am not so sure that can be said about the @entity1 and @entity65 4.0 @entity64			1
there is no doubting that the features are impressive and the phone stunning in what it can do , and @entity20 has created an amazing product			2
nine years ago , @entity20 was making clamshell phones with small mono displays and 10 - key dial - pads			0
today it has made a phone that will be seen as a benchmark for manufacturers			0
just think about that for a moment			0
of course having a phone for everyone does n't need to matter for @entity20			0
unlike @entity39 , @entity20 creates and sells a range of different phones for different people in multiple sizes and shapes			0
this is the phone for the flag bearers , this is the phone for the early adopters and what @entity20 is hoping , will be the phone that its other customers will want to look up to , and eventually have			1
