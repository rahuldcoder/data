amid leaden wintry skies , it may come as a surprise to @entity3 but new figures suggest the city has beaten its arch rival , @entity7 , to become the world 's most popular city for tourists			1
however , a growing spat between the the two cities ' administrations suggests that , when it comes to comparisons between @entity17 and @entity7 , there are only lies , damn lies and statistics			1
figures released this week by the @entity23 's @entity22 show that 4.9 million people visited @entity17 from july to september 2013			1
that was an increase of 20 % on the same period in the previous year -- during which @entity17 hosted the @entity26 -- and a new quarterly record			1
taking a wider view , for the first nine months of 2013 , 12.8 million visitors flocked to the @entity23 capital , an increase of 12 % compared with the previous year			0
the figures prompted the city 's promotional body , @entity17 and partners , to proclaim that @entity17 was " on course to welcome over 16 million visitors in one year			1
" that in turn has led to reports in @entity23 and abroad that @entity17 has trumped @entity7 as the most visited city in the world			1
the two cities have actually swapped the top spot on various lists in recent years			0
according to the @entity46 for 2012 , @entity17 narrowly beat out @entity7 for the top spot with 16.9 million visitors			1
' greatest city on the planet ' for the mayor of @entity17 , @entity53 , the statistics only underlined the obvious			1
" these incredible figures prove that @entity17 is without doubt the greatest city on the planet , " he said			1
" with so many fascinating museums , the best theater scene in the world , more green space than any other @entity63 city , numerous top sporting venues , a low crime rate and much else besides , it 's no wonder that people from all over the globe are flocking to @entity17 in record numbers			2
" a long , hot summer , @entity73 's @entity72 win , the birth of @entity75 and blockbuster @entity76 shows including " @entity78 " were put forward as potential reasons for the surge in tourist numbers , along with the legacy of the @entity26 from the year before			1
@entity85 attractions such as the @entity86 and @entity87 said visitor numbers were " through the roof " last summer , with an increase of 17 % on 2012 , the @entity83 reported			0
@entity87 's welcomed 353,463 visitors between may and august , up by almost half on 2012			0
spat turns nasty all pretty impressive , but it turns out that the source of @entity17 's promotion to top tourist spot was none other than ... @entity99			2
proclaiming " @entity17 dethrones @entity7 , " the conservative daily @entity100 had compared @entity17 's projected 16 million visitors with a 2012 figure of 15.9 million visitors to @entity7			1
things have only got nastier since			0
seizing on the comparison , @entity7 's right wing mayoral candidate , @entity105 , claimed the numbers showed @entity7 's @entity109 administration as failing the city			2
that 's just @entity7 bashing , one of those @entity115 , @entity7 's deputy mayor @entity111 , retorted			2
other figures , her office said , revealed @entity7 still to be beating the sprawling , unsophisticated pretender over @entity120 when it comes to pulling in tourists			1
indeed , @entity17 is in some ways just a " suburb " of the far more attractive @entity99 capital , she told reporters			2
@entity7 ' still no. 1 ' " like it or not , while @entity17 may have attracted more visitors around the @entity26 , @entity7 remains the number one world tourist destination , even if we only include foreign visitors and not national ones , " @entity111 said			1
@entity17 was " boastful " about its strengths , even deceptive , whereas the @entity99 were " rational " in their self assessments			2
" @entity17 aggressively sells itself ... in a way that goes beyond the truth			0
we are more rational in our communication when speaking about @entity7 's strengths , " @entity111 said			0
in 2012 , 29 million domestic and foreign tourists visited the wider city of @entity7 , @entity111 's office said			1
by contrast , @entity17 -- 10 times larger -- pulled in only 27.6 million tourists of all nationalities			2
while clearly superior intellectually to @entity3 , @entity146 could , @entity111 conceded , appear " arrogant			0
" " we could be a bit more amiable , " she said			0
" i often tell people they must smile more			0
" @entity151 weighs in @entity7 spluttering be damned , @entity17 and partners has used its figures to promote a new video campaign , @entity156 , in which well known @entity3 reveal what they most love about the city			1
celebrity chef @entity151 says : " you ca n't beat a good @entity17 curry			0
i 've been to @entity162 but i find curries in @entity164 [ in the @entity165 ] better			0
it 's not just curries			0
" there 's nowhere better in the world to eat than in @entity17 , " says @entity151			0
" a great thing about @entity17 is shopping , " adds @entity171 it girl @entity170			0
" what girl does n't love shopping ? @entity17 is the best -- we 've always been the best in fashion			0

figures show @entity17 beating @entity7 as most visited city by tourists last year
@entity26 legacy , royal baby and " @entity78 " all possible reasons
@entity7 *decries* statistics as " boastful " and misleading
