-- earlier this month @entity1 released its annual supplier responsibility report which detailed alleged workplace health and safety protocol violations by its suppliers			2
one of its chief suppliers , @entity7 , has been at the center of a storm in recent months after workers at some of its plants in @entity14 staged strikes and even threatened mass suicide to win better working conditions			1
who is @entity7 ? @entity7 is part of @entity20 - based @entity7 , one of the world 's largest suppliers of components for the electronics industry			1
much of its manufacturing division is based in mainland @entity14 , where it assembles a range of products including @entity1 's @entity31 and @entity32 , @entity34 's @entity33 and @entity36 's @entity35			1
with 1.2 million employees in @entity14 alone , production takes place at more than 12 factories across the country , including the giant @entity43 plant in the southern city of @entity45 -- the company 's biggest manufacturing facility , and employer of almost half of its @entity14 workforce			1
@entity7 produces an estimated 40 % of the world 's consumer electronics			1
who does it do business with ? @entity7 makes everything from motherboards and gaming consoles to @entity60 players and smartphones for some of the world 's biggest electronics brands , including @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67			1
however @entity1 is its prized partnership			0
the company has seen phenomenal sales growth in mainland @entity14 in particular and opened @entity72 's largest @entity71 in @entity73 in september			1
the company announced in july that its revenue from the @entity76 , which includes @entity77 and @entity20 , reached $ 8.8 billion for the first three quarters of the fiscal year , a more than six-fold increase over the same period a year earlier			0
last week , analysts at investment bank @entity82 predicted the @entity84 tech giant could sell 40 million @entity31 handsets in @entity14 alone in 2013 when it agrees to deals with more @entity14 telecom providers			1
this compares to the 68.5 million iphones @entity1 sold worldwide in 2011			2
what is it accused of ? though @entity7 has a reputation in the technology field for its efficiency and low overhead , critics say workers are treated like machines for low pay in an oppressive military - style environment -- employees typically eat , sleep and work at the giant complexes			1
" they wake up , they have breakfast , they go to work , they work a solid shift , they come back to their dormitories and they sleep ... it 's a very dehumanizing place , and the workers are little more than machines there , " said @entity105 of the @entity106 , a @entity77 based non-profit group that tries to protect workers ' rights across @entity14			1
in 2010 , @entity7 raised workers ' pay twice at its factory in @entity45 after a spate of suicides , @entity14 state media reported at the time			1
in january , @entity36 issued a statement saying it was investigating a report that workers at a plant that manufactures the @entity35 game system had threatened mass suicide in a pay dispute			1
@entity7 would only say that there was a protest at its @entity138 factory in @entity140 province in central @entity14 and that it was over			2
last year , an explosion at a @entity7 plant that produces @entity1 's @entity143 killed four people and injured 18 more			1
@entity14 officials said the blast may have been caused by combustible dust in a polishing workshop			0
the incident , in the southwestern city of @entity150 , followed a report by rights group @entity153 ( @entity155 ) that workers at the same plant do not have adequate training in the use of chemicals and do not have regular on the job health checks			0
a number of workers @entity155 said it spoke to when compiling the report complained of allergies being ignored by @entity7 , poor ventilation and inadequate personal protective equipment			2
what has it said ? though @entity7 maintains its workers are treated well , chairman @entity169 made an unprecedented public apology in 2010 after the suicides			2
@entity7 said it had introduced counselors , started a 24 - hour phone counseling service and opened a stress room where workers can take out frustration on mannequins with bats			0
in january the company published a statement saying it is " committed to honoring and respecting the codes of conduct of our customers , our own policies and practices , and the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where we do business			0
" addressing specific criticisms , the company said all employees were given regular breaks , access to healthcare , a safe environment to work in and the opportunity for promotion to other technical or line management positions			0
the statement concluded by saying @entity7 was " not perfect " but had made " tremendous progress " with the positive impact its programs were having on employees			0
what does @entity1 say ? @entity1 ceo @entity208 recently responded to a report in the @entity210 that described the " human cost " of building an @entity32 at the @entity7 plants			1
in an email to @entity1 employees , he said the company had never turned a blind eye " to the problems in its supply chain and any suggestion it does not care about the plight of workers is " patently false			2
" " we care about every worker in our worldwide supply chain " the company added in a statement issued sunday			0
" we insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions , treat workers with dignity and respect and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever @entity1 products are made			1
our suppliers must live up to these requirements if they want to keep doing business with @entity1			0
" in the 2011 edition of its supplier progress report , @entity1 said @entity208 and other senior company representatives had visited @entity7 's @entity45 plant a year earlier to evaluate conditions there following reports of suicide attempts			2
@entity1 then commissioned an independent review by a team of suicide prevention experts			0
this team was asked to conduct a deeper investigation -- which included speaking with workers and site managers -- evaluate @entity7 's response , and recommend strategies for supporting workers ' mental health in the future			2
according to this year 's supplier progress report , workers in @entity45 now have access to free psychological counseling , including a 24 - hour hotline , to get advice on their personal and professional concerns			0
@entity1 also pointed to the establishment of its employee assistance program ( @entity265 ) , which is focused on social - support networks and " maintaining employee mental health			0
" the 2012 report also provided a list of @entity1 's leading production suppliers for the first time , with each one subject to an audit of safety and the environmental conditions			1
it said one of the most significant improvements had been in clamping down on labor violations -- specifically the use of underage workers			0
the same report also responded to last year 's deadly explosion at @entity7 's @entity150 plant , saying new requirements for handling combustible dust throughout its supply chain had been established			0
these included better ventilation and more comprehensive inspections at production facilities .			0
