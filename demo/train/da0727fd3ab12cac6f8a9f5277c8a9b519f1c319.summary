-- so , just what is @entity2 up to now ? on april 17 , at the same time @entity2 president @entity4 snarled at @entity6 and the @entity7 at a press conference in @entity9 , @entity2 foreign minister @entity3 signed a conciliatory agreement in @entity11 with the @entity12 , the @entity13 and @entity6			1
on the face of it , the foreign minister seemed to repudiate the president and betray the @entity18 terrorists in eastern @entity6			2
whatever @entity4 and @entity3 's game , the statement signed by @entity3 in @entity11 represents a major stand down by @entity2			1
to be sure , given the @entity24 's past mendacity and slipperiness , the agreement is ultimately nothing more than a piece of paper			0
if @entity4 could breach the @entity29 ( wherein the @entity12 , the @entity30 and @entity2 agreed to guarantee @entity6 's security and territorial integrity ) , he could easily tear up the @entity11 statement if and when it suits him			1
in his press conference , true to form , @entity4 denied the existence of @entity6 as a separate nation , reserved to himself the right to intervene in @entity6 , and supported the @entity40 armed commandos who have caused havoc in eastern @entity6			1
here 's @entity4 on @entity6 as really being @entity2 : " the desire to get @entity2 and @entity6 to quarrel , to divide what is essentially a single people has been an object of international politics for centuries			1
@entity4 says the fanatical @entity50 and their reactionary @entity52 opponents agreed on one thing only : that @entity6 and @entity2 were a " part of a common , united space and a single people			1
" and , he adds , " they were absolutely right			0
" @entity6 , naturally , beg to differ			2
if @entity6 has no right to exist as a separate nation , then why should n't @entity4 bring @entity6 " home " whenever he chooses to follow in the footsteps of the @entity50 and the @entity62 ? here 's @entity4 on the right to intervene to " help " @entity2 and " @entity2 - speaking citizens " in @entity6 : " but we know exactly that we ought to do everything to help these people defend their rights and independently determine their fate			1
this is what we will fight for			0
let me remind you that the @entity73 gave the president the right to use armed forces in @entity6			2
i very much hope that i will not have to exercise this right and that , through political and diplomatic means , we will be able to resolve all the acute , if not indeed very acute , problems in @entity6 today			0
" unsurprisingly , @entity4 's insistence that he has a right to aid @entity6 citizens spooks @entity6 , especially as his invocation of that right is coupled with the continued massing of thousands of battle - ready @entity2 troops along @entity6 's borders			1
finally , here 's @entity4 on the @entity18 commandos who have terrorized southeastern @entity6 in the last week and thereby compelled @entity91 to try to regain control of the region : " now we hear of calls ( by the @entity7 ) to the people in the southeast to lay down their arms			1
... but then ( the @entity6 authorities should ) pull back the army from the civilian population			0
... all right , the east will disarm , all right , let 's assume the army will withdraw -- why have the ( @entity6 ) nationalist groups not been disarmed yet ? " one of the central points of the @entity11 statement undermines @entity4 's concerns : " all illegal armed groups must be disarmed ; all illegally seized buildings must be returned to legitimate owners ; all illegally occupied streets , squares and other public places in @entity6 cities and towns must be vacated			1
" @entity11 made it clear that all groups should be disarmed and all buildings and streets be vacated -- immediately			1
there is no talk in the statement of one side 's disarming first and then the other 's disarming next			0
because virtually no @entity6 armed groups are in @entity6 , nor are they occupying buildings -- the groups have been disarmed in the last few weeks -- the statement applies almost exclusively to the @entity2 - supported , @entity2 - funded , and @entity2 - directed commando - terrorists			1
@entity3 also signed the following statement : " @entity129 will be granted to protesters and to those who have left buildings and other public places and surrendered weapons , with the exception of those found guilty of capital crimes			0
" this is , indirectly , a recognition of the @entity6 government 's legitimacy , something that @entity4 repeatedly denied at his press conference			2
after all , who is to capture the terrorists and determine if they committed capital crimes ? the @entity6 @entity145 , the procurator 's office , and the @entity148 , of course			0
if the government is illegitimate , then so , too , they are illegitimate			0
conversely , if they are legitimate , then so , too , is the government			0
president @entity154 was absolutely on the mark to be skeptical of @entity2 intentions			0
" our strong preference would be for mr. @entity4 to follow through on what is a glimmer of hope coming out of these @entity11 talks , " he said			2
" but we 're not going to count on it until we see it			0
and in the meantime , we 're going to prepare what our other options are			0
" even so , the @entity11 document is important			0
it represents a standard against which the reduction of terrorist activities in eastern @entity6 and @entity2 's behavior toward them can be measured			2
thus far , the evidence is neither encouraging nor discouraging			0
@entity2 insists the @entity6 have to move first , the extremists in @entity177 and @entity178 have insisted the agreement does not affect them , and their comrades in @entity181 have seized more buildings			1
on the other hand , extremists in @entity184 abandoned the buildings they had occupied and the @entity178 separatists have promised to vacate two floors and the conference hall of the state province administration building			0
regardless of the desultory response by @entity2 and its supporters , both the @entity12 and @entity6 have , correctly , insisted that @entity2 stick to the agreement and convince its supporters in eastern @entity6 to surrender their arms and abandon the buildings they seized			1
@entity91 has also agreed to an amnesty for those extremists who did not , as the document insists , engage in capital crimes			0
and @entity202 , the former prime minister - turned - political prisoner who is now running for president , has used the agreement as the basis for calling on the extremists to engage in roundtable discussions			0
the next week or two will demonstrate whether @entity2 is or is not serious about the @entity11 agreement			2
if the terrorist groups do not abandon buildings and give up their arms , and if @entity2 does not stop infiltrating @entity2 intelligence agents into @entity6 , then @entity4 and @entity3 will effectively be declaring that they can not be trusted and that their intentions in @entity6 are aggressive			1
alternatively , if they adhere to the agreement , the document could lead to further forms of de-escalation , perhaps even including a permanent withdrawal of @entity2 troops from @entity6 's borders			2
opinion : why @entity11 accord on @entity6 is tactical victory for @entity2 ? are @entity3 and @entity4 playing good cop - bad cop , hoping to convince the @entity12 , the @entity13 , and @entity6 that @entity2 really is reasonable and has no aggressive intentions ? if so , is this just a ploy to win time while war preparations continue ? or is their routine indicative of @entity2 's finally coming to its senses ? has @entity4 realized that invading or destabilizing @entity6 will bring him and @entity2 nothing except painful @entity7 sanctions and the possible arming of @entity6 's military ? whatever the answer , it seems obvious that the @entity7 's consistent expressions of support for @entity6 and condemnation of @entity2 's illegal annexation of @entity245 , along with @entity91 's decision finally to resist @entity2 aggression , played some role in convincing @entity4 to have @entity3 make nice			1
the moral is clear : talk tough and act tough , and @entity4 may just possibly listen .			1

@entity251 : @entity4 belligerent about @entity6 as his minister signs accord
@entity251 : despite @entity4 hard line , @entity11 statement is a major step down by @entity2
@entity259 says illegal armed groups must be disarmed ; illegally seized buildings returned
@entity251 : it seems that if you talk tough and act tough , @entity4 may just possibly listen
