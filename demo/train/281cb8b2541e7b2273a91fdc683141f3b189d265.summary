-- i remember a bleak time in @entity3 when the economy was so maddeningly out of touch with the needs of its people that anyone lucky enough to own a car would remove their windshield wipers at night and take them inside			1
in their command economy -- oblivious to the laws of supply and demand -- some official forgot to order wipers and consequently , they were n't for sale anywhere			1
inspired by a hungry black market , thieves would work late into the night snapping them up			1
@entity25 's main square is pleasant day or night			1
many @entity26 remember @entity3 as bleak and rundown -- full of rusting factories and smoggy cities			1
i remember a time when the air was so polluted it turned my hanky black the day i entered the country			2
glum locals used to stand patiently in line at a soda stand to sip a drink from the same tin cup tethered to the stand by a rusty chain			2
of course , those days are long gone now and many @entity26 visitors are stunned speechless when they step into @entity25 's vibrant main square , @entity44 's lively streets , or @entity46 's colorful @entity45			1
while a new affluence has arrived , visitors can still see a variety of @entity50 : lively and cosmopolitan urban centers ; breathtaking medieval cities showing off a dynamic history ; grimy industrial zones still cleaning up the mess left by the @entity53 ; and hundreds of traditional farm villages in the countryside			2
as i 'm more nostalgic for the humble old days than most locals , i 'm sure to venture into the countryside			1
city dwellers often talk about the " simple people " of @entity3 -- those descended from generations of farmers , working the same plots for centuries and living an uncomplicated , traditional lifestyle			2
spending time with this large contingent of old - fashioned , down - to - earth folks can be a great way to get a true sense of @entity3 's story			1
sometimes my nostalgia for the old times confounds my @entity77 hosts			2
in @entity25 , my friend , @entity78 , wanted to treat me to a fine dinner and asked where i 'd like to eat			2
i said a " milk bar			2
" @entity78 said her mother would never forgive her if i took her @entity26 friend to one of these bleak government - subsidized workers ' diners			2
i begged , promising i 'd never tell , and @entity78 agreed			2
for me , eating at a " bar mleczny " -- or " milk bar " -- is an essential @entity77 sightseeing experience			0
these super-cheap cafeterias , which you 'll see all over the country , are a dirt - cheap way to get a meal , and , with the right attitude , a fun cultural adventure			0
in the communist era , the government subsidized the food at milk bars			0
the idea : to allow lowly workers to afford a meal out			0
the tradition continues , and today @entity3 still foots the bill for most of your milk - bar meal			0
prices remain astoundingly low -- my bill usually comes to about $ 3 -- and , while communist - era fare was less than lively , today 's milk - bar cuisine is tastier			1
milk bars offer many of @entity3 's traditional favorites			1
common items are delicious soups , a variety of cabbage - based salads , fried pork chops , pierogi ( ravioli with various fillings ) , and pancakes			0
at the milk bar , you 'll often see glasses of watery juice and -- of course -- milk , but most milk bars also stock bottles of water and @entity135			0
try a @entity77 pastry , especially the classic paczki , a glazed jelly doughnut typically filled with a wild - rose jam			0
at milk bars , the service is aimed at locals			0
you 're unlikely to find an @entity144 menu			0
if the milk - bar lady asks you any questions , you have three options : nod stupidly until she just gives you something ; repeat one of the things she just said ( assuming she 's asked you to choose between two options , such as meat or cheese in your pierogi ) ; or hope that a kindly @entity144 - speaking person in line will leap to your rescue			1
if nothing else , ordering at a milk bar is a fiesta of gestures			0
smiling seems to slightly extend the patience of milk - bar staffers			0
every milk bar is a little different , but here 's the general procedure : @entity169 to the counter , wait to be acknowledged , and point to what you want			1
two handy words are " to " ( sounds like " toe " and means " that " ) and " i " ( pronounced " ee " and means " and " )			0
my milk - bar dialogue usually goes like this : @entity179 lady says " @entity180 ? " ( can i help you , please ? )			0
i say " to " ( while pointing ) ... " i to " ( pointing again ) ... " i to " ( pointing once more )			0
it means , " that ... and that ... and that			0
" it 's not pretty , but it gets the job done			1
chowing down with the locals you 'll marvel at how you can still eat lunch for $ 3 while experiencing a little bit of nostalgia from @entity3 's communist days			1
