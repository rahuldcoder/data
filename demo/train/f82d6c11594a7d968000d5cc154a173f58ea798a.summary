-- you do n't need to be a teenage boy to realize how scary girls can be			0
@entity5 plays a demonic cheerleader in " @entity7 , " written by @entity8			1
the @entity10 - winning " @entity11 " scribe proves as much in her second screenplay , a horror comedy about @entity14 ( @entity5 ) and @entity15 ( @entity16 )			1
these bosom buddies have a relationship that stretches back to the sandbox			0
they 're inseparable opposites : @entity14 is a babe , head cheerleader and a bit of a snot			1
@entity15 is nerdy , conventional and a soft touch			0
except that when we first meet her , she 's locked up in the local mental hospital , kicking back at the guards and muttering darkly about the murders that put her here			2
looking back , she dates this disastrous turn of events to the day @entity14 talked her into seeing an up - and - coming indie band at the roadhouse			0
the gig ends in a deadly inferno that claims the lives of several schoolmates , then @entity14 drives off with the band for an @entity43 after - party involving satanic rites and virgin sacrifice			0
she survives on a technicality , but shows up later that night at @entity15 's place covered in blood , barfing blue goo and craving fresh flesh			2
in the days after the tragedy the entire school seems to be suffering from post-traumatic stress			0
only @entity14 seems unfazed by the community 's second sucker punch : the gruesome fate of the star quarterback in the woods			2
what 's a girl to do if her best friend turns into a heartless boy - eating demon ? @entity15 cleans up the mess and hopes it 's just a phase			1
the last time a horror flick tried for a distinctly female point of view the result was " twilight , " which was more of a wan gothic romance than a chiller			2
directed by @entity68 , who made " @entity71 " and " @entity72 , " " @entity7 " is n't anything like that			1
it 's a much edgier , snappier , bloodier film , aimed primarily at young hipsters and horror fans -- plus anyone else curious to see @entity5 get nasty			1
( that 's got to include a sizable chunk of the audience , surely ? ) so smoldering hot that at one point she coolly sets fire to her tongue , @entity80 makes a convincing vixen , callously picking up victims whenever her luster begins to fade			2
it 's not hard to imagine she can have anyone who takes her fancy -- even @entity15 is not immune to her charms			2
ironically , though , @entity14 is really the needy one here , while her friend eventually finds the self - possession to stand up to her			0
similarly , you might come for @entity80 , but it 's @entity16 's expressive range and toughness that leaves a more lasting impression			1
the " @entity102 " starlet is destined for good things			0
ireport.com : share your review of " @entity7 " the bitingly smart , funny teen - speak is carried over from " @entity11 , " along with sharp pop culture references and a sassy feminist attitude , but the million - dollar question has to be : is it scary ? only occasionally , i 'm afraid			1
the gore scenes come with weird little flourishes : @entity14 's mounting body count attracts a crowd of curious woodland creatures , sounding a sweetly sick echo of " @entity118 , " and a climactic showdown is set in a spectacularly fetid abandoned swimming pool ( do n't they drain those things ? )			0
but the jokiness does tend to undercut the terror			0
i suspect the film will prove too freaky for " @entity11 " boosters , and could have used more straight - ahead scares and sustained suspense to appease the hardcore horror geeks			1
that said , this entertainingly oddball offering does twist fresh kinks into a genre that 's always crying out for new blood			0
" @entity7 " is rated r and runs 102 minutes .			1

" @entity7 " is a horror winner with doses of comedy , says @entity139
@entity141 stars @entity5 as a cheerleader who turns demonic
@entity16 , playing @entity5 's friend , provides movie 's standout *performance*
" @entity7 " was written by " @entity11 's " @entity8
