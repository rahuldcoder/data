" x-men : @entity7 " has stars aplenty , but does it have what it takes to make it a summer blockbuster ? the reviews are in for the film , which stars @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 and others -- and not everyone agrees on the latest installment of the " x-men " series , a sequel to 2006 's " x-men : @entity19 " and 2011 's " x-men : @entity21			1
" the plot revolves around the group sending @entity24 ( played by @entity10 ) into the past to try to change a calamitous future			1
@entity28 's @entity27 writes , " step up , cynics , and see the summer 2014 blockbuster that gets damn near everything right			2
" ok , maybe ' @entity7 ' is merely a stopgap between ' @entity21 ' and the upcoming ' x-men : @entity34 , ' " @entity27 continues			1
" but it 's also a movie that uses action to define character and has the skills to make you care about outcasts in a society that hews spinelessly to the norm			2
a rousing epic of mind and heart in a summer of craven formula			0
" @entity48 of the @entity49 writes , " in the case of ' @entity7 , ' the plot is as overelaborate and muddled as some of the effects			1
" the logic of the story -- a time - travel pretzel that strains after the brain - teasing power of an old " @entity61 " episode -- requires too many variables , " according to @entity48			0
" the frantic crosscutting of the culminating battles , which take place simultaneously and also a half - century apart , requires too much thought on the part of the audience because it has received too little on the part of the filmmakers			0
" @entity70 of @entity71 also references " the pretzel - logic pop fantasia " but takes a more positive view			0
" i know all of this sounds like a tangled thicket of cosmically @entity76 , " @entity70 writes			0
" but @entity78 's marvelous script makes it all move with a @entity81 jeweler 's precision and hum with internal logic			2
it 's complex without being confusing			2
" the @entity85 's @entity84 cautions fans to not expect some questions from past films to be answered ( like how is @entity90 's professor @entity89 still alive , anyway ? )			0
but , he says , " ' x-men : @entity7 ' is , in itself , as intoxicating as a shot of adrenaline			1
it 's what summer movies are meant to be			0
" have you seen " x-men : @entity7 , " and what did you think ? any plans to see it this weekend ?			1

" x-men : @entity7 " came out this week
it stars @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12
some *critics* say it 's a blockbuster done right ; others question *twisty* plot
