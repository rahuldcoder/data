-- the success of any tightly scripted , live event is certainly measured in ratings , ticket sales , buzz , and -- with regard to quadrennial political nominating conventions -- voting returns			1
but the real yardstick for any major pop - culture event comes down to one simple element : the surprise celebrity cameo			1
recent examples include @entity14 and @entity15 skydiving into the @entity16 ; @entity18 's hologram at @entity19 ; and when @entity20 popped up to say goodbye to @entity21 on " snl			0
" hoping to add itself to that storied list , apparently , is the @entity25			0
the latest @entity27 schedule , released on monday , notes that before presumptive @entity29 presidential nominee @entity28 is introduced by sen. @entity30 , the convention will hear remarks from someone -- or something -- " to be announced			1
" that tantalizing clue led @entity36 today to report via a single unnamed source that actor , filmmaker , and all - around @entity41 icon @entity40 is indeed the surprise guest			1
unless it 's football player @entity44			0
or former president @entity45 arriving via parachute ( the 85 - year - old is quite the skydiver )			0
or , as one aide maybe joked in the story , " a @entity52 hologram			0
" these are all choices with serious potential to stir up some major buzz -- if the remarks were n't preceding the biggest speech of @entity28 's political career			2
that 's the trick of a surprise guest : you want people to be impressed , but you do n't want to overshadow the main event			1
would @entity28 look cooler drafting off of @entity40 or @entity44 ? or by comparison would he seem more like a businessman android than some already claim he is ? see the full article at @entity0			2
