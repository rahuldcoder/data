-- @entity2 football continues to troubled by the scourge of racism , according to a @entity6 report			1
over the last year @entity2 's football authorities -- as well as @entity2 's justice system -- have had to contend with racism cases involving @entity10 of @entity11 and @entity13 's @entity12 as well as @entity15 's @entity14 and @entity16 of @entity17			1
in december , the @entity18 handed @entity12 an eight - match ban and a Â £ 40,000 fine after finding the @entity21 guilty of racially abusing @entity10 , while in july , @entity22 captain @entity14 was cleared of racially abusing fellow footballer @entity16 at @entity23 " much has been done to improve the atmosphere and behaviour at football matches and it has become a much more family - friendly activity , " said chair of the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) committee @entity26 mp			1
" however , recent incidents of racist abuse in the @entity35 , both on and off the pitch , have highlighted the fact that there remain significant problems			0
" it should be a priority for the @entity18 to develop procedures for stewards to follow and regular training opportunities to ensure that all relevant staff at club grounds are capable of reacting swiftly and consistently to incidents of abuse			2
" and the @entity25 committee called on the @entity18 to do more in tackling all forms of abuse in the game : " while the general level of progress in combating racism and racist abuse in the @entity35 is positive and should be applauded , there is much more that can and must be done , and we believe it is for the @entity18 to take the lead and set the example for everyone , from football authorities at all levels to the grassroots groups , to follow			1
" the @entity18 , the @entity66 and the @entity67 issued a joint response to the @entity25 report			2
" we agree with the @entity27 that whilst substantial progress has been made to promote equality and tackle discrimination in the game , challenges remain for all of the football authorities , " said their statement			2
" we remain committed , along with all of our stakeholders , to promoting equality and diversity within the game and to the eradication of all forms of discrimination in football			2
" we will continue to work across the entire breadth of the sport to deliver our inclusion and anti-discrimination agenda			0
in doing so , we will consider in detail how the @entity27 's recommendations can support and influence this work			0
evidence given to the @entity25 suggested that homophobia might now be the biggest problem football is facing			0
" recent research found that 25 % of fans think that football is homophobic while 10 % think that football is racist , " said the @entity25 , which wants the @entity18 to promote a campaign to " highlight the damaging effect of homophobic language and behaviour in around football at every level			0
" as well as identifying homophobic abuse as well as " laddish " behaviour as significant problems , the report demanded a more active response from the authorities to racial abuse at grassroots level			1
the report noted that social media -- such as @entity112 and online forums -- had been used to spread racist and abusive content but suggested the medium could be used more effectively to counteract the problem of abuse			0
" " we believe that the football authorities should be using this developing forum for communication and debate , to spread positive messages about equality and diversity and also to speak out strongly against instances of racist abuse when they occur , " added @entity26			0
there are very few black managers in @entity2 football 's four divisions -- @entity133 is the only one in the @entity66 -- and the @entity25 committee called for improved recruitment processes across all clubs and football authorities			1
" more needs to be done to increase the diversity of the pool of candidates for coaches and referees , to embed the values of equality and diversity at all levels of the game , " said the report			0
although @entity14 was cleared of racially abusing @entity16 in the courts the @entity22 captain faces an @entity18 racial abuse charge on september 24			1
the @entity18 's three - man @entity151 will judge that case " on the balance of probabilities " , a lesser burden of proof than " beyond reasonable doubt " which is used in the courts			2
@entity2 football is not the only sport that is currently facing the issue of racism			1
@entity165 shortstop @entity164 has been suspended for three games by the @entity165 for wearing eye - black displaying a homophobic slur written in @entity169 during a game last weekend against @entity171 .			0
