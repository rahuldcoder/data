-- reports that @entity2 could earn millions of dollars for her first post-jail media interview have triggered howls of protest that crime will have paid for the @entity8 drug trafficker			1
but legal experts say @entity8 's proceeds of crime laws could ultimately make it a challenge for her to hold on to any profits made from selling her story			1
a high - profile breakfast host for @entity8 television network seven -- the broadcaster tipped to be the front - runner to secure the @entity23 interview -- spoke out on - air tuesday voicing his disapproval at unconfirmed reports his bosses were set to pay a $ 2 million ( about $ 1.8 million ) for her story			1
" i reckon we should have nothing to do with her as a network			2
totally disagree with paying a convicted drug smuggler a $ 2 million , " said @entity32 , co-host of the @entity34 program			2
" i know @entity37 's corrupt and all that sort of stuff , but you know , she 's convicted , so why pay the money ? " @entity42 did not respond to @entity0 's request for comment , but in @entity46 , @entity42 journalist @entity45 told reporters outside the luxury compound where @entity23 has been staying with her family that the network was paying for security guards attached to her since her release			2
he said a deal had not yet been struck to secure the interview , but disputed the amounts cited by @entity32			1
@entity23 , 36 , was released on parole from a prison in @entity46 , @entity37 , monday after being convicted almost nine years ago of smuggling 9 pounds ( 4.1 kilograms ) of marijuana into @entity46 's @entity60			2
she has maintained she was the victim of a set - up and many @entity8 sympathize with her cause			1
her case has attracted immense interest from @entity8 media , and on her release she was mobbed by a throng of reporters chasing an interview			1
but @entity70 , senior lecturer in journalism at the @entity72 , said forking out big dollars for the @entity23 interview " could backfire " on the network that successfully bid on her story this time			1
she said there was a long tradition of " checkbook journalism " by @entity8 's highly competitive commercial broadcasters , stretching back to the @entity83 case in the 1980s			1
but while popular sentiment surrounding certain stories , such as the beaconsfield mine collapse survivors , held that subjects were entitled to financially benefit from their experiences , public sympathy for , and interest in , @entity23 appeared to have waned in the years since her conviction			0
" i just do n't think people feel very fondly about @entity2			2
they just do n't , " said @entity70			0
" they did , and then they got bored with her			0
" on social media , many were critical of the reports of an impending big payday for @entity23			0
" i see a line of pot smugglers heading towards @entity46 , thinking ' in 10 years , i 'll be rich ! ' " wrote @entity102 user @ milesb			0
" that 's 200k per year her jail time ... plus other money she 's going to make ... not a bad wage , " wrote @ @entity107			0
checkbook journalism by television networks has been under scrutiny in @entity8 recently , after @entity42 reportedly paid a significant sum for an interview with the partner of @entity115 , subsequently sentenced today to 18 years for having murdered his former girlfriend			1
@entity70 said the negative public response to @entity23 's potential paycheck were in part " a response to being bored to tears " by the saga			0
" the entire time she 's been in prison , every bit of @entity2 's life has been thoroughly explored			2
what more could she possibly tell us ? " she said unimpressive ratings for a telemovie based on @entity23 's story were evidence of the public 's fatigue			0
" it 's staggering to me that @entity42 is doing this because they must have had some indication that the audience was tiring of the story			0
" @entity140 , senior law enforcement lecturer at @entity141 , said @entity23 could find it difficult to hold on to any money earned for an interview , due to @entity8 laws allowing the government to seize assets acquired through the proceeds of criminal activity			1
@entity8 authorities had previously used those provisions to seize @entity23 's earnings from a magazine interview , he said			1
" there 's a real question as to whether there would be an appetite to go after her , because she is so popular here in some sectors , but there are people in @entity37 law enforcement who would very much like to go after her if she 's paid that money , " he said			0
under an agreement between @entity8 and @entity37 , @entity37 authorities could request that their @entity8 counterparts act to recover the funds			1
however , @entity23 could attempt to put the money beyond reach of officials by placing it in an offshore bank account or trust , he said			0
" if she 's smart , she will put the money offshore so it ca n't be touched , " he said			0
the first clear picture of @entity23 since her release appeared in @entity8 media tuesday , a picture of her toasting her freedom with a beer alongside her brother			2
the picture was subsequently removed from websites amid a dispute over who owned , and who had been paid for , the photo .			0
