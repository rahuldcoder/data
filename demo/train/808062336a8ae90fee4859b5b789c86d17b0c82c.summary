-- in a tournament which has produced so many shocks perhaps the only surprise is that it took @entity5 so long to put his legions of fans through the mill. as @entity9 paused , skipped its afternoon tea and instead munched nonchalantly on strawberries and cream , @entity5 threatened to sour an afternoon which had promised so much			1
the stage was set -- gone were the usual suspects			2
there was no @entity17 , no @entity18			0
this was @entity5 's moment			1
but somebody forgot to tell @entity22 - the man who had the audacity to threaten the home favorite 's apparently seamless stroll to the final			1
two sets down and staring elimination in the face , @entity5 produced when it mattered			1
the @entity31 rallied in heroic fashion to win 4 - 6 3 - 6 6 - 1 6 - 4 7 - 5 and seal his place in the semifinal of @entity35 for the fifth time in his career			1
" there 's been a lot of matches where i 've been behind and managed to turn it round , " @entity5 told the @entity38			1
" i do n't know if it is the most emotional match , but it was an unbelievable atmosphere and great to get through			0
" @entity22 served unbelievably well especially when he was behind			1
in the first set he played some really good stuff , in the second set my level dropped and i started rushing a bit			2
" i managed to turn it around			0
i made some poor choices			0
he 's a very , very good player he 's been at the top of the game before and he 's playing well again			0
" i started to play more solid and really took my time when i had the chance			0
" tears last year , @entity5 stood on the @entity59 at @entity35 and captured the hearts of a nation as he cried through a speech just minutes after his final defeat by @entity17			1
weeks later , he exorcised that ghost , defeating @entity17 on the same court to win @entity67 gold and give himself the perfect preparation going into the @entity69			2
@entity5 's heroic victory over @entity71 in @entity72 ended @entity9 's 76 - year wait for a grand slam champion as he finally equaled the achievements of @entity76			1
defeat in the final of the @entity78 deprived him of a second slam , while injury prevented him from competing at @entity81			2
not since @entity76 triumphed in 1936 has the home crowd saluted one of its own -- but @entity22 appeared disinterested by such sentiment			1
the @entity86 , currently the ninth best player in his own country , had never made it past the fourth round of @entity35 before this year			0
ranked 54 in the world , the left - hander was supposed to merely turn up and succumb to the inevitable			2
but this @entity35 tournament has refused to conform with normality -- @entity18 , @entity17 , @entity94 and @entity95 will tell you that			0
instead , it was @entity22 who took the contest to @entity5 , swinging with his prodigious forehand which left the @entity101 chasing hopelessly across court			1
the 29 - year - old took the opening set 6 - 4 to leave @entity5 cursing his luck and silence a partisan crowd			1
while the vocal support roared @entity5 back to the baseline , it was @entity22 who was making all the noise			1
once again he left @entity111 questioning his game as he hit winner after winner to claim the second set 6 - 3 and leave his opponent teetering on the edge			1
@entity118 but then @entity22 blinked			1
from being in control of the contest , @entity22 squandered the initiative and allowed @entity5 to waltz to the third set 6 - 1			1
suddenly the impetus was with the home favorite and backed by the majority of the 10,000 crowd and countless others on ' @entity128 ' , he roared back into the contest			0
whereas an hour earlier it was @entity5 looking at the sky , this time it was @entity22 who was left with more questions than answers			1
now it was @entity5 's turn to dominate , showing that extra level of fitness and rapid cross-court speed as he leveled the match by taking the fourth set 6 - 4			1
having won 14 of his 20 contests which have gone to five sets , @entity5 would have been confident of pulling off the great escape			1
@entity22 proved a stubborn opponent , holding serve with relative ease to take the match to 5 - 5 in the decider			1
but in the 11th game , @entity5 finally made the breakthrough , taking a 6 - 5 lead before serving for the match which he did with aplomb			1
@entity155 @entity5 will play @entity156 's @entity155 in the last four after the 24th seed saw off fellow pole @entity158			2
@entity155 hit 30 aces and 58 winners on the way to becoming his country 's first ever male grand slam semifinalist			0
" really i have not many words to say right now , " he told the @entity38			0
" i 'm just really happy and it does n't matter if i 'm the first or second from @entity156			0
" earlier , six - time grand slam winner @entity71 swatted aside @entity167 7 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 3 to make it through to the semifinal stage			1
the @entity171 star , who defeated @entity18 in the 2011 final , will play @entity174 ' s @entity173 in the last four			1
djokovic , who has now reached 13 consecutive grand slam semifinals , avenged his 2010 defeat by @entity167 -- a contest which propelled the @entity179 into the final on that occasion			2
the 26 - year - old was 3 - 0 down in the second set but wrestled back control of the match before seeing off his disheartened opponent			2
" it was a close match -- it could have gone either way , " @entity71 told reporters			0
" he was a double - break up in the second set			2
i do n't know how i got out of that , but i was serving and returning well			0
" i have a commitment to go far in this tournament			0
i am playing some of my best tennis on grass even though it 's not my preferred surface , " @entity197 revealed his disappointment after his performance tailed off following a promising opening set and a half			2
he said : " i can play better than i played today			0
if you give him too much then it 's a lot			0
" @entity173 meanwhile , @entity173 overcame an injury to his left knee to ease past @entity208 @entity207 6 - 2 6 - 4 7 - 6			1
the @entity174 hit 42 winners and 12 aces after slipping on the @entity59 surface early on during the last eight clash			0
@entity173 , who had not reached the semifinal of a grand slam since winning the @entity69 four years ago , is the second @entity174 to reach the last four following @entity215 in 2002			2
" i was really close , " del @entity173 told reporters after being asked how close he was from retiring			2
" i felt a lot of pain at the beginning of the match			0
it was exactly the same as before			0
" it 's really , really painful			0
i twisted my knee once again , but the doctor gave me some magic pills so i could finish the match			0
i 'm so glad to go through			0
" @entity207 had problems of his own , revealing he was struggling with an ankle injury			1
" i was n't able to warm - up properly but it was fine during the match , " he told reporters			0
" i do n't think his injury affected him			0
he was more focused and aggressive , served really well and deserved to win			0
