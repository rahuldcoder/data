it was a shocking and gruesome discovery : three dead infants found in a @entity3 home so squalid that police officers had to search it in hazmat suits			1
now , days later , as investigators continue to search through what the @entity9 describes as the home 's " deplorable conditions ( such as ) massive insect infestation , mounds of used diapers and feces , " a picture is beginning to emerge of the family that lived inside			1
and it 's a picture so deranged , so unfathomable to a reasonable mind , that even a lawyer for the accused calls the situation " completely inexplicable			1
" @entity24 was arraigned september 12 on a bevy of charges stemming from the discovery of the dead infants at her home the day before , but she has not been charged in their deaths			1
the 31 - year - old pleaded not guilty to charges of concealing an out of wedlock fetal death , two counts of permitting substantial injury to a child , intimidation of a witness , cruelty to an animal and violating an abuse prevention order , according to @entity45 , a district attorney spokesman			2
whether or not @entity46 is the mother is not known by authorities for certain at this point , but her attorney assumes that she is			1
" my expectation is that it will be confirmed that they were indeed hers , " @entity51 told @entity52			0
@entity46 lived in the now - condemned single family home with her longtime boyfriend , @entity58 , and the couple 's children			1
just how many children lived with them in the vermin - infested 1,150 - square - foot home , however , depends on which parent you ask : of the four living children that the state removed from the home on august 28 , @entity46 told investigators that @entity58 , 38 , only knew about two of them			1
the other two -- a 3 year old and an infant , according to @entity51 -- were apparently not only born in secret but lived hidden from their father amid mountains of garbage under the same roof			1
@entity58 also " presumably " did not know about the ones that had died , at least according to the account @entity46 has told authorities , @entity51 said			0
" it is a mystery to me how mr. @entity58 could have failed to notice ( the ) numerous pregnancies ( of ) the woman with whom he shared a bed , " said @entity51			2
" it 's a mystery to me how he could have failed to realize that there were two children living under the same roof as him , and he did n't know about it			2
" @entity52 was unable to reach @entity58 or members of his family sunday evening			0
he has not been charged with any crime , and there is no public record of physical abuse			0
' prisoner of her own fear ' @entity51 said that while his client 's explanation " is not based in reality , " the situation @entity46 came to be in was the result of fear , not malice			0
" she was terrified of the pregnancies being discovered , " said @entity51			2
" she was terrified of the two younger children being discovered			1
why ? i do n't know the answer to that			0
" whether based in reality or not , @entity51 said @entity46 was " a prisoner of her own fear " and suggested it was that fear that explains the three infants found dead in her home			1
" try to imagine the state of mind of a woman who attempts to hide a pregnancy , go into labor and deliver children -- at least twice , but presumably five times -- on her own			1
" " i feel certain that she did not do anything to harm any of these children , " he said			2
" i do n't think there will be a determination that they were killed			0
" though @entity51 said he has yet to consult with a pathologist , he said it is not clear if they were ever alive to begin with or if they were all stillborn			0
abuse suspected in 2007 the state 's removal of the four living children at the home last month was the result of the filing of what 's called a @entity144 report in @entity3 , according to @entity145 , a spokesman for the state 's office of @entity148			1
a @entity149 can be filed by any citizen with reason to believe that a child has been abused or neglected			0
this was not the first time a @entity144 had been filed when it came to that home , according to a @entity3 @entity157 spokeswoman			1
@entity158 said such a report was previously received in 2007 , but that " it was unsupported and therefore no case was opened			0
" for now , @entity158 said @entity157 has @entity46 's four children in its care and is focused on " ensuring ( their ) safety and well - being and providing them with the proper medical care , support and services they need , " she said			2
@entity45 said that the family caring for them has no public statement to make at this time			0
@entity46 's case was adjourned to october 14			0
investigators , meanwhile , remain at the scene digging through the squalor			2
" our investigation will continue for quite some time , " said @entity178 , the @entity179 district attorney			0
@entity181 accused of slaying five kids had history with social services			0
