-- @entity2 's governing body is taking the unusual step of rewriting its own rulebook in the middle of the season in an attempt to end the tire crisis threatening to undermine the sport			1
the @entity10 has acted quickly by deciding to amend two rules which ban race drivers testing and prevent tires being changed during the season			1
the drivers and teams had called for urgent action after a series of dramatic tire blow - outs compromised driver safety at the @entity22 @entity21 sunday			1
@entity33 driver @entity32 , who lost the race lead when his left - rear tire unravelled on lap eight , the @entity23 of @entity24 and @entity25 , @entity27 's @entity26 , @entity29 's @entity28 and @entity31 's @entity30 were all affected by tires failures			0
in response to the chaotic scenes at @entity39 , the @entity10 has proposed that race drivers take part in a tire development test at the @entity22 circuit on july 17 - 19			1
the test had originally been set aside for the teams to trial their young drivers , who are now set to miss out on a rare opportunity to drive an @entity2 car			0
" our priority is to ensure safety for all in @entity2 and we believe the incidents at @entity39 represent a genuine safety concern for the drivers , " said @entity10 president @entity51			1
" we have thus taken the decision to alter the @entity59 in a bid to solve the problems we saw at the @entity22 @entity21			1
i believe it is fitting to carry out this work at the circuit upon which the issues were manifested			0
" the @entity10 's @entity67 now has to give the green light to the rule changes , but that is expected to be a formality			0
@entity2 's sole tire supplier @entity73 is due to announce its response to the chaos at the @entity22 gp later on tuesday			2
the @entity77 manufacturer said at @entity39 it had been looking forward to focusing on the racing after being reprimanded at an @entity10 hearing for organizing a three - day tire test with @entity33 in may -- but instead @entity73 has found itself once again the center of unwanted attention			1
mercedes -- who were also reprimanded by the @entity10 for using race drivers @entity32 and @entity86 and a 2013 car at the controversial @entity89 tire test -- have decided to sit out the @entity39 test for the sake of harmony within the sport			2
the @entity96 team 's " secret " test still riles their rivals -- especially as they have since won races in @entity99 and @entity22 -- but the shocking tire explosions at the @entity21 have underlined the need for @entity73 to find a legitimate solution to the tire failures			2
@entity73 had wanted to introduce a new tire construction at the @entity105 @entity21 in june but failed to get all the teams to agree to the plan at a meeting in @entity99			0
a spate of worryingly delaminations -- where the tire layers separate -- earlier in the season had led to concerns the tires were not safe			0
when @entity73 took over from @entity116 as @entity2 's official tire supplier in 2011 , the rubber was deliberately designed to be less durable so that teams would do more pit stops and the racing would be more unpredictable			0
but subsequent changes to the construction of the 2013 tire , based on the same principles , have now provoked not just unpredictability but chaos on the track .			0
