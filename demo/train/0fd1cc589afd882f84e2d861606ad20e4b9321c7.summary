-- do any of these scenarios sound familiar ? - somebody cuts in front of you in the grocery store line			1
you 're irritated but do n't say anything			1
- your friend asks you to pick her up at the airport			1
you say yes even though you have no time			1
- you disagree with your boss , but say nothing			1
are you nodding yes ? we 've all had moments when we think to ourselves , i 'm confident , i 'm smart , and i know what i want			1
why ca n't i just say it ? being assertive -- standing up for yourself and speaking your mind in a clear yet respectful way -- can be remarkably hard on a good day			1
we worry if we ask for what we need , we 'll put someone out			1
or that we 'll come across as a you - know - what			1
so we just let what we want go unsaid			1
in your defense , it is more of a challenge to state your needs these days			1
the still - shaky economy may make you hesitant to ask for that raise at work ( or disagree with your boss )			1
you may feel worse turning down requests from family , knowing they 're stressed			1
and it 's not just your imagination that more folks are losing it in public -- witness the woman who sprayed mace at fellow shoppers on @entity42			1
a recent survey revealed that 86 percent of @entity44 have been the victims of rude behavior			1
the payoff of having your own back , though , is enormous -- and it 's so much more than simply getting your way			1
" when you say what you want , you live a happier and more authentic life , " says @entity50 , author of " @entity51			1
" that 's true no matter what the outcome , adds @entity57 , @entity58 , director of the cognitive behavioral training program at @entity60 in @entity61			1
those who speak up do better at work , have more time , and have healthier relationships			1
so how do you master this crucial skill ? " the three keys , " explains @entity50 , " are knowing what you want , believing you have a right to it , and finding the courage to express it			1
" you are about to become your own best advocate			1
@entity0 : 29 days to a healthier relationship be assertive ... with friends and family surprisingly , your nearest and dearest can be the toughest to stand up to			1
" they 're the people we want to please the most , " says @entity50			1
" we 'd rather be unhappy ourselves than disappoint them			1
" to complicate matters , we have to fight a lifetime of old ( bad ) habits -- saying " sure " when we really mean " no way			1
" true , standing your ground can be momentarily uncomfortable , but it 's so worth it -- your relationships will be stronger as a result , @entity50 says			2
try these tactics : challenge # 1 : saying " no ! " your sister is always asking you to watch her kids ; your running buddy keeps dragging you to spinning class , which you hate			2
the solution : there is a trick to getting your way when someone does n't pick up subtle hints			2
take a deep breath so you sound calm -- not at all peeved -- and just say , " no , i 'm not able to do that , " @entity57 advises			2
if she pushes back ( which she likely will ) , repeat , minus a word or two			2
" no. i 'm not able			2
" this may go on for several rounds			2
" each time , you shorten the phrase until you eventually just say no , " says @entity57			2
" it 's extremely effective because it allows you to convey what you want without getting upset			2
" challenge # 2 : sticking with your values you need your folks to respect your decisions about your kids ; you want the in - laws to stop breaking the bank on gifts			1
the solution : when you 're broaching a sensitive topic , it 's best to start with the word " i "			2
( this is particularly effective at deflecting arguments over hot button issues			2
) " ' i ' statements are expressions of your own needs , which we all are entitled to have , " explains @entity57			2
using " you " statements , on the other hand , can put the other person on the defensive , which will only escalate an argument			1
keep it simple and own it ( " i feel my kids act crazy when they eat candy , so i do n't want them to have any			2
" ) challenge # 3 : breaking a pattern maybe your friend always picks the restaurants ( and pricey ones ) , or your man chooses your vacation spots every time			2
the solution : this one pops up a lot in close relationships			2
here , too , that " i " statement is key			0
soften it with at least one thing the other person will be happy to hear ( " our date nights are so fun , but i would love to see a movie this time			1
" ) @entity0 : 10 ways to shake up date night be assertive ... at work overdue for a raise ? longing for more interesting assignments ? working with spotlight stealers who are constantly broadcasting their accomplishments ( and taking credit for some of yours ) ? you know what you have to do ! " assertiveness is one of the most crucial tools for success , " says @entity170 , @entity171 , a psychiatrist who specializes in workplace issues			0
" to be able to clarify a thought , make it precise and relevant , and share it at the right moment is an art. " luckily , it 's a learnable art. consider this your cheat sheet for getting your needs met from 9 to 5			0
what you need : to ask for a raise or promotion ( and get it ) how to proceed : show your best stuff is yet to come let 's be honest : even if you feel confident , marching into your boss 's office and rattling off all the reasons you deserve more cash or seniority is n't the way to go			0
that said , " you do need to present your case , citing two or three of the valuable contributions you 've made to the company , " recommends @entity170			0
( timing your request so it comes after a major accomplishment is wise			0
) but equally crucial , @entity170 adds , is to look ahead to the future : " discuss the things you want to do in the future that are in line with your boss 's goals			0
" in so doing , you gain power in the negotiations , because you become more valuable to your manager			0
what if the head honcho flat - out says no ? ask : " can we talk about my performance again in six months ? " you 're not pushing ; you 're just showing that you believe in your skills enough to follow through			0
what you need : to get an idea green - lighted at a meeting how to proceed : do n't go first though you may think it 's always best to get your idea on the table first , it 's actually smarter to listen before you take the floor , @entity170 says			0
" look to see how you can piggyback your idea with someone else 's , " she advises			0
wait for two or three people to speak , then make your case , saying something like , " my idea , which works well with @entity231 's , is ...			0
" the piggyback strategy not only increases the likelihood that you 'll get your idea approved , but it also tends to defuse competition between co-workers and create a more collaborative and creative workplace			0
keep in mind that brevity helps , so make your case in three to five sentences , advises @entity170 : " when people do n't feel confident , they tend to say too little or too much , and their point is n't clear			0
" @entity0 : job killing you ? 8 types of work - related stress be assertive ... in public the @entity248 d ' at a restaurant gives away the table you were next in line for			0
the guy using the treadmill before you leaves it dripping in sweat			0
you 'd think that speaking up with strangers would be easy -- after all , you never have to see them again			0
but some of us actually have more trouble in these situations because we feel like our speak - out skills are on display			0
make it simpler with this advice			0
when you want to register a complaint ... the best strategy : make a complaint sandwich			0
not sure how to ask for a refund on the top you washed once that promptly fell apart ? make what 's called a complaint sandwich , says @entity274 of @entity275 , which manages customer service programs for companies			0
the layers of the sandwich , in order : a statement saying how much you enjoy the product or brand , then a description of the problem , then a statement that you hope the company / store can stand behind its products and fix the issue			0
sample script : " i shop here all the time , but i washed this shirt once and it came apart			0
i 'd like you to replace it or give me a refund			0
" when you want someone to stop doing something annoying ... the best strategy : stick to the facts			1
if you 're not used to speaking your mind , your go - to reaction may be a pointed stare or loud sigh , but these nonverbal expressions of anger are n't going to help you get what you need -- or make you feel good about yourself , notes psychologist @entity306 , @entity307 @entity0 : find your ultimate happiness better bet : state your case in a neutral tone ( think tv newsreader ) and reserve the eye - rolling for when you watch @entity316 marathons			0
when you want to right a wrong the best strategy : find common ground			0
@entity319 , advises @entity320 , president of @entity321 , who consults with companies on customer service and human relations			0
say a fellow shopper snatches a marked - down pair of shoes out of your pile			0
instead of snapping at her , put her move in context			0
a simple " wow , this sale is crazy ! " before pointing out that those heels are yours helps you get what you deserve -- in the most pleasant way possible .			0

a recent survey revealed that 86 percent of @entity44 have been the victims of rude behavior
