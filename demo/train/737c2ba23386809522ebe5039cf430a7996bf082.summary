@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 politicians are currently scrambling for air tickets to @entity6			2
@entity8 's foreign secretary @entity7 rushed to @entity9 soon after @entity10 announced its recognition of @entity12 and @entity13			1
@entity15 vice president @entity14 will follow			0
@entity9 's president @entity16 has made it clear that he would welcome closer ties with the @entity19			2
they want to shore up the @entity4 - leaning president @entity16 , amid fears that his country could become the next frontline in the power struggle between @entity10 and the @entity19			1
it is in part a deliberate signal to an emboldened @entity29 not to overreach			0
but @entity31 nations will only be taking their support so far , for geographical , practical and political reasons			2
conflict between @entity10 and @entity35 , a tiny country of around 5 million citizens , was one thing			0
conflict with the 47 million strong @entity9 would be a different matter , with much wider ramifications			0
what do you think of @entity10 's relationship with the @entity19 ? while @entity35 's president @entity45 , at least for the moment , seems to have the bulk of the @entity35 population behind him , @entity9 is much more divided about relations with @entity29			1
there is a huge energy dependency			0
around 17 percent of @entity9 citizens , according to the census , are ethnic @entity10			1
even the country 's political leadership is divided			0
although they were allies in @entity9 's 2004 @entity57 and both would like to see @entity9 in the @entity31 , prime minister @entity55 has distanced herself from @entity16 's eagerness to enter the embrace of @entity61			1
she has also criticized his presidential decree restricting the movements of @entity10 's @entity9 - based @entity65 fleet , based in @entity9 's @entity67 peninsula , where there is a heavy concentration of ethnic @entity10			1
@entity16 flew to @entity70 to stand shoulder - to - shoulder with @entity45 over the conflict in @entity35 , while @entity55 focused on calls for a cessation of hostilities			0
@entity7 used his visit to @entity6 to insist that @entity10 's re-drawing of the map in the @entity79 was a moment of truth for @entity82 , marking the end of a @entity85 period of geopolitical calm			1
but significantly @entity7 also urged @entity9 to avoid giving @entity10 a pretext to intervene in the @entity67 , where @entity6 accuses @entity10 of trying to stir up trouble -- just as @entity45 had accused @entity29 of doing in @entity12 before launching his military assault			1
the @entity91 port of @entity92 is leased to the @entity10 @entity93 until 2017 and @entity16 has urged that @entity10 should be asked for a higher rent and be subject to more restrictions			0
@entity7 may be making the toughest warning noises he dares to @entity10 , but he also urged that " the @entity9 government should ensure that the letter of the agreements are stuck to until 2017			1
" in recent years @entity9 has sought an uneasy balance between courting the @entity19 and not too overtly angering @entity29			0
but lately @entity16 has grown bolder , offering to co-operate in the @entity15 missile defense shield in @entity82 , despite the chilling threats from @entity29 to @entity103 over its planned participation			0
@entity61 and @entity31 leaders would not want him to get much bolder than that			2
while a majority of @entity9 , according to opinion polls , would like to see their country in the @entity31 , they are sharply divided about joining @entity61			2
only last april @entity111 president @entity110 complained about the country 's lack of political stability ( a key qualification for membership )			0
disputes between president and prime minister over relations with @entity10 , he suggested , were holding up progress			2
there is a regular @entity31 / @entity9 meeting next month and @entity6 will be looking for strong signals that it will meet a favorable response over its membership aims			1
@entity7 declared in @entity6 : " my visit is designed to send a simple message : we have not forgotten our commitments to you			0
" @entity9 allies like @entity103 will be pushing for those words to be reinforced with action , but @entity31 commitments tend to come with rather vague timetables , and to become entangled in wider issues			1
@entity103 's prospects of speeding its membership prospects will depend on who wins the internal @entity31 argument between those who , with an eye to their energy supplies , want to see the conflict with @entity10 cool down and those who want to send a strong signal to @entity10 prime minister @entity149 and president @entity150 , in that order , that they have already gone too far .			1
