@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 was n't looking to become a martyr -- or a victim			1
late last month , the 16 - year - old student was just hanging out with his friends in downtown @entity0 , out of school and having fun			0
they all took a selfie to mark the moment , and never expected that moment would become so momentous			0
the car bombing targeted and killed @entity15 , a former @entity1 ambassador to the @entity16 -- but several others also lost their lives			1
minutes after the blast , @entity3 appeared in another picture			0
in it , he 's seen lying unconscious and bleeding on the pavement			2
he would die later from his wounds			0
as is the custom in @entity1 , hardly any time had passed before @entity3 , an innocent bystander , had been branded a far weightier title			1
all of a sudden , " victim " had morphed into " martyr			1
" and for many younger @entity1 , so sick of recent violence and rising sectarianism throughout the country , that was just too much			1
" i think @entity3 was the straw that broke the camel 's back , " explained prominent @entity1 blogger @entity33			1
" because what he was doing was taking a selfie , which all of us do every day , and it 's in a safe neighborhood , supposedly			1

seeking not only an end to senseless slaughter , but also justice for @entity3 , they began protesting the teenager 's death through a unique online campaign called " not a @entity54			1
" when the movement 's facebook page sprang up soon after @entity3 died , it contained a message that resonated : " we can no longer desensitize ourselves to the constant horror of life in @entity1 , " read a statement from the group			1
" we refuse to become martyrs			2
we refuse to remain victims			0
we refuse to die a collateral death			0
" as a tribute to @entity3 and other civilians who died in recent bombings , supporters of the campaign were encouraged to post photos of themselves in which they 'd write resolutions they sought for @entity1 and include the hashtag # notamartyr			1
dozens have already done so			0
among the pictorial messages posted are the following : the concept of martyrdom is deeply ingrained in @entity1 's war - scarred psychology			1
but a younger generation is now rejecting the idea that anybody who dies as a result of political - or sectarian - motivated bombings or shootings is automatically a martyr			2
" in @entity1 , the word martyr has a lot of gravitas to it , " @entity33 told me			1
" when you say martyr , there 's no questioning that title			1
but it got to a point where it sort of became a way to absolve the government of the duty it has to actually investigate and punish the people doing that ... what you see today is people who are saying , no , we do n't want to be a martyr			1
we are victims if we die when we 're going to work or to school or doing daily life things			0
as we stood in @entity0 's @entity113 , he described " a general sense of helplessness and hopelessness in @entity1 these days			1
" " i think , a lot of people feel like we 're sitting ducks waiting for our politicians to play some kind of sick game , " said @entity117			2
" @entity124 actually requires a kind of self - sacrifice			0
you have to be willing to die for something			0
and a lot of these bystanders that are being killed in these attacks never actually voiced any kind of interest in dying in a certain cause			0
" while many in @entity1 , a tiny country that survived a brutal 15 - year civil war , are accustomed to this kind of violence , there 's no doubt a sadness has set in of late			1
as neighboring @entity143 burns , sectarian divisions in @entity1 have deepened			1
since july , both @entity145 and @entity146 strongholds across @entity1 have been targeted in a wave of bombings			1
dozens have died as a result			0

" i felt like we needed some kind of motivation , " @entity117 said			0
" i felt like most people have given up and i think i 'm pretty to close to giving up as well , and unless something happens , it 's hard to still fall in love with this country and have hopes and dreams about it			1
" adding to the general unease over the spillover of violence from @entity143 's civil war , @entity1 's economy is also in tatters			1
job options , even for @entity1 's best and brightest , are few and far between -- a sentiment reflected in the @entity117 posted			1
" mine says i do n't want to end up in @entity179 , " explained @entity117			0
" i mean , sadly , @entity1 is losing all its youth because there are no opportunities here , it 's not safe			1
if you want to start a family you ca n't really do it here			0
job opportunities are very , very limited			0
" on the " not a martyr " @entity189 page and @entity192 feed , you 'll see many such complaints			2
whether taking on economic woes or bemoaning rampant corruption , the campaign has given voice to a generation seeking to improve life in @entity1			1
@entity1 singer @entity200 is among them			1
" the campaign is really interesting for me , " said @entity204 , " because i think it 's one of those campaigns that stem out of a political event that actually has reachable goals			2
" @entity204 , lead singer of the extremely popular band @entity200 , is , like many others , using the platform to advocate change			0
" we have people talking about animal rights , about the rights of domestic workers , about small stuff like traffic , like everything else			2
and then , the bigger stuff as well , like , you know , national security , safety			0
" @entity204 added : " you have people talking about security , you have people talking about their rights as women , their rights as @entity230 people			2
" @entity204 , who is openly gay , posted a picture of himself holding a sign in @entity235 that read , " i want to hold my boyfriend 's hand without being afraid of the police			2
" " my selfie , " said @entity204 , " was about homophobia with the police and not feeling secure with sort of public displays of affection or public declarations of sexual identity			0
" according to @entity204 , the campaign has also given many @entity1 a much needed space to discuss things they do n't like about @entity1			1
" not that these things are necessarily gon na be resolved when someone posts a selfie , " said @entity204 , " but it 's interesting to sort of see how the bigger political issues in the country actually sediment [ sic ] into people 's daily living experiences			2
" @entity204 and other " not a martyr " supporters are n't the only ones using creativity to combat complacency			2
after the bombing that killed @entity3 , @entity1 artist @entity264 put on a provocative performance by dressing up as a suicide bomber and wandering around @entity0			2
while the costume was cartoonish and bystanders mostly amused , @entity264 told me her display was deadly serious			0
" this is me protesting against the normalization of these bombings , " she said			0
for @entity264 , who lives abroad and visited @entity1 over the holidays , it was an attempt to jolt spectators out a dangerous mindset she fears is setting in			2
during her stay , two bombs went off -- the one that killed @entity3 and another in southern @entity0			0
" i was driving in @entity0 and on each red light , i was looking for a bomb , actually			2
and i was waiting for when the bomb is gon na go off , " explained @entity264			0
" and the fact that i looked outside my car 's window and ( was ) looking at the people and noticing that the people are feeling the same , and they might be as well looking for a bomb , that was kind of the key feeling that i felt i need to do a reaction to in a way , so this is how the idea started basically			1
" before she set out in disguise , @entity264 was quite worried about the reaction she 'd receive			0
while some were scared by her , most were simply amused			0
several folks took pictures - others even posed for selfies with her			0
and while @entity264 's happy she never faced any danger , that has n't diminished her concern for what 's happening in @entity1			1
" feeling that you 're gon na die anytime soon just becomes a process that you go through if you 're walking in the street , " said @entity264			0
" so this is quite worrying			0
" but @entity264 , like the supporters of " @entity316 " , refuses to give up on @entity1			2
for them the point will never be about how to celebrate a death , rather , how to build a life			0
