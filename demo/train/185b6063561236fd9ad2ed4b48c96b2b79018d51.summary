-- it 's all over now			0
@entity2 won the @entity3 , which ca n't have surprised anyone who watched it demolish @entity6 en route to the championship			0
but according to @entity0 's calculations , @entity6 should have taken home the trophy			1
while @entity12 was battling @entity13 to be the tournament 's top goal scorer , while @entity16 and @entity17 were batting away shots on goal , while @entity20 and @entity21 were stalking the sidelines , @entity0 was looking at the bigger picture			1
we started with the @entity26 world ranking for each team going into the @entity3 , starting with @entity28 ranked number one , all the way down to @entity31 at 62			1
then we looked at how much each country was paying its manager			2
@entity34 topped that table , paying @entity21 nearly $ 11.5 million a year , according to @entity36 of @entity37			1
@entity38 came a distant second , with @entity40 , @entity6 and @entity41 rounding out the top five			1
soccer - mad @entity43 came dead last , paying manager @entity44 about $ 214,000			0
next we added in each country 's population size , since bigger countries have larger pools to draw potential soccer stars from			1
the @entity50 was the biggest country to qualify , followed by @entity6 , @entity51 , @entity34 and @entity52			1
@entity53 and @entity54 were the smallest , both with populations under 4 million			0
then we averaged the three measures -- ranking , manager salary and population size -- to come up with our own prediction for how each team would fare in the @entity3			1
our predicted winner : @entity6			0
it was the second - largest country in the tournament , ranked third in the world by @entity26 , and with manager @entity67 's $ 3.8 million salary putting him fourth			1
it fared well enough in the group stages , but once things got serious , the hosts completely fell apart , conceding 10 goals in their last two matches and scoring only 1			0
that left it in 4th place , three below where we predicted it should end up			0
@entity2 , on the other hand , overperformed , but not by much			0
we picked it to come second , and it came first , for a rating of +1			0
our statistics also tell us who the biggest over- and under - achievers of the tournament were			0
the numbers suggest @entity91 should have come 27th overall , but it trounced the big boys in the @entity93 and came out 8th , by @entity26 's official statistics			1
second - place @entity95 also did far better than our predictions			0
yes , it was ranked fifth in the world going into the tournament , but it did n't shell out big money for a manager -- @entity104 was the 22nd - best paid coach -- and @entity95 falls in the middle of the population table			1
of course , having @entity12 be one member of that population makes a difference , even if the @entity109 did n't touch him in the final			0
@entity28 , on the other hand , was a giant dud			2
ranked third in the @entity0 table , it actually came 23rd			1
only one nation came out worse : @entity38			2
ranked 10th in the world , with the second - best paid manager and and the 11th - largest population , we think it should have come fifth			2
@entity40 and @entity34 also suffered in our rankings , partly for paying their managers so handsomely			1
we say @entity40 should have come third , not 22nd , and @entity34 should have tied at sixth place with the @entity50			1
@entity34 actually came 24th , while @entity126 came 15th			2
the numbers also show one remarkable coincidence			0
on paper , @entity129 and @entity130 are almost identical			2
@entity129 was ranked 11th by @entity26			1
both have populations of about 11 million people , and the two nations paid their managers exactly the same salary			0
both teams did better than we predicted			0
we picked @entity130 to come 18th , but it managed 13th			0
@entity129 did even better , coming sixth , nine places higher than our calculations suggested			2
@entity0 's @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 contributed to this report .			2

@entity0 worked up its own rankings for how each team should have done
our table is based on @entity26 ranking , manager salary and population size
@entity38 , @entity28 , @entity40 and @entity34 were the biggest *disappointments*
@entity91 *punched* *farthest* above its *weight* , and @entity129 also shone
