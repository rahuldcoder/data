if you were planning on using a @entity2 - penned phrase on , say , a locket or a jewelry box , think again			1
because you could be trying to shake off a legal bill			2
@entity2 , whose business savvy is rivaled only by her aptitude for earworms , has taken out several trademarks for phrases like " party like it 's 1989 , " " this @entity14 , " " @entity15			1
" this means you 'll need @entity2 's permisison if you want to use any of those phrases on a whole host of stuff : aprons , " non-medicated " toiletries and -- we kid you not -- walking sticks			2
the filings are on top of dozens more she 's held for years			0
they were reported by @entity30 , citing the legal database , @entity32			0
interestingly enough , " @entity34 " is not on the list			0
perhaps because that trademark is already held by a diet company			1
@entity2 took out the trademarks last year on the heels of her fifth studio album , " 1989			1
" given the incredible success of that album , you ca n't blame a girl for wanting to protect her brand			0
and if you 're hate , hate , hating on her for that , well , you know what you can do			0
@entity2 sends epic care package to fan			2
