for @entity2 's @entity1 , the 2007 attack on a minibus in southern @entity2 's @entity5 -- in which suspected @entity7 militants shot eight @entity8 through the head in broad daylight -- was simply further proof of what she 'd been saying for more than three years			1
" we have to help people there to survive			0
if they need to be trained , train them			0
if they need to be armed , arm them , " she was quoted as saying by one of her military staff , according to media reports			0
meanwhile , @entity2 was convulsed by demonstrations condemning the attack			1
her response was to boost her support for the @entity29 or @entity30 , the militia the @entity33 department , under @entity1 @entity1 's direction , established in 2004			0
unlike other militia in the strife - torn region , whose make up reflects the local demographic , the @entity35 is exclusively @entity41 , is often stationed near temple compounds and is tasked with protecting @entity41 communities			1
while @entity8 is associated in the @entity48 mind with pacifism , @entity41 nations such as @entity2 , @entity45 and @entity46 have been engaged in vicious conflicts			1
in @entity2 , state security is now locked in an increasingly bloody civil war with the @entity7 minority near its border with @entity55 , in @entity45 civil strife looms between @entity8 and @entity58 @entity57 in @entity59 and @entity46 has just concluded a protracted civil war with its @entity62 minority			1
cycle of birth and death @entity8 , with its emphasis on karma and samsara -- the idea that the cycle of birth and death is driven by the actions of an individual -- is traditionally deeply averse to killing , believing it creates negative karma that will be revisited on a person in their own lifetime or in subsequent reincarnations			2
so how do the largely @entity41 state security in these countries square their beliefs with the need to fight ? @entity84 , assistant professor of @entity85 at @entity87 's @entity86 and co-editor of the book @entity90 , says that warfare is part of the human condition irrespective of religion			1
" the first thing to remember is that people have a penchant for violence , it just so happens that every religion has people in it , " @entity84 told @entity95			0
history of conflicts he said that while @entity8 has a 1,600 - year well - documented history of monastic - led rebellions and conflicts , the association of @entity8 in the @entity48 mind is with pacifism			1
" @entity8 certainly has a lot within its precepts about pacifism			1
in fact , almost every global religion does , " he said			0
however , @entity8 differs in that the act of killing is less the focus than the " intention " behind the killing , he said			2
" when there are @entity41 monks traveling with soldiers in @entity46 and chanting with them and blessing them , their perspective is that they are not trying to support the violence but ... it 's better to have soldiers with a cool , calm , clear head , with good intentions , than those that are hot headed , " @entity84 said			1
self - immolations he said @entity133 's @entity132 spoke of the same focus on " intention " when asked about the recent spate of self - immolations in @entity133			0
" he pointed out that these people are not on drugs , they do n't seem insane but they 're doing it for a cause - the intention seems to be clear , " he said			0
" this is often used to rationalize violence within @entity41 circles but as we 're seeing now with @entity45 and @entity2 , cool heads are not prevailing now			1
" he said @entity41 states often mesh nationalism with @entity8 , justifying war on the grounds that a fracture in the nation state is a tear in the sacred fabric of a land which represents the well - spring of their belief			1
" @entity46 often speaks about ' the little teardrop island ' as the last true vestige of true @entity8			1
so when the @entity163 , the @entity163 , tried to separate a portion of that ' teardrop island ' it was analogous to attacking the mother , " @entity84 said			0
political rhetoric as with most countries that use violence to solve disputes , @entity84 says the political rhetoric will begin to assume that the means justifies the ends			2
" the rhetoric of violence as a defense , and this is not unique to @entity8 , is the idea of violence for the sake of peace , " he said			1
" that although this is an infraction , although we are gaining negative karma , it 's for the greater good -- prima facie anyway			0
" @entity41 nation states have historically sought to use @entity41 doctrine to justify war			2
during the @entity192 invasion of @entity193 in the 1930s , for instance , soldiers were told not only that they were defending @entity8 but that emptiness in @entity8 is the only true reality , therefore , in the end , nobody was being killed , @entity84 said			2
ultimately , added @entity84 , @entity41 countries battling insurgencies will find that their root problems are economic rather than sectarian			1
" how many strong @entity8 states are we looking at in the world ? how many of them are economically strong ? because with economic strength and vitality comes less likelihood of civil insurrections and wars			2
" of course , we see a lot violence with @entity7 countries now , but we also see a lot of poverty with them too			2
" identity crisis for @entity2 - based security analyst @entity220 the problems in @entity2 's south have less to do with religion than with identity			1
@entity223 : @entity2 's deadly southern insurgency " the fact that the @entity29 is exclusively @entity41 , does n't say anything about @entity8 in ethical terms ; it 's just something that sets them apart from other security units , " @entity220 told @entity95			1
" the issue is not about religion			0
" he said that while there were many factors influencing the insurgency -- economic , historical and the fact , he says , that the violence has migrated from rural areas to the cities -- he had also noticed a generational dimension to the problems			0
" my experience with the older generation is that i still sense a strong fabric of society that still gets along together -- people are still friends whether they are @entity7 or @entity41			2
" but i do n't get that sense very strongly with the younger generation			0
" he said that while older @entity8 generally speak functional @entity252 to communicate with their neighbors , younger people have little interest in learning the language , regarding it as something only their grandparents do			2
the state emphasis on speaking @entity259 at schools has created problems , he said , reinforcing differences between the two communities			0
" and it 's not just @entity259 , but @entity259 -- that 's how ethnocentric the @entity259 nation state can be			0
but they do n't seem to understand that 's a problem ; that we need to accommodate the local identity , " @entity220 said			0
he said the confusion between culture and religion was one of the driving forces behind the violence			0
" it 's like ( groups ) that say they practice correct @entity7 , but what is correct @entity7 ? @entity7 is a religion not a culture , " he said			0
" the problem ( in southern @entity2 ) is that they do n't separate these things ; for them it 's two sides of the same coin			1

@entity8 is strongly associated in the @entity48 mind with pacifism
despite this , increasingly @entity41 countries are mired in insurgent violence
in @entity46 to @entity45 and southern @entity2 , @entity8 have been urged to take up arms
analysts say , as with many religions , @entity8 is seen as a part of a national identity
