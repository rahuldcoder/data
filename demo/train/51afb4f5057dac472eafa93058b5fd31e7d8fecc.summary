the @entity1 is not returning combat troops to @entity3 , president @entity0 insisted again wednesday , despite the suggestion by his top general that option is something the @entity8 could consider			1
speaking at @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity0 said again that @entity1 troops " do not and will not have a combat mission " in @entity3 against the @entity12 in @entity3 and @entity13			1
" after a decade of massive ground deployments , it is more effective to use our unique capabilities in support of partners on the ground so they can secure their own countries ' futures , " he said			1
" and that 's the only solution that will succeed over the long term			0
" " as your commander in chief , i will not commit you and the rest of our armed forces to fighting another ground war in @entity3 , " @entity0 told troops at @entity27 in @entity28			1
rather , the @entity1 forces will support @entity3 forces on the ground as the @entity3 fight @entity38 , he said			1
" when we do things alone and the countries -- the people of those countries -- are n't doing it for themselves , as soon as we leave , we start getting the same problems , " @entity0 said			2
@entity46 : ' we will have enough allies ' @entity0 's position was reiterated by @entity1 secretary of state @entity46 , who testified before the @entity49 about the administration 's plan to defeat @entity38 , the terror group that refers to itself as the @entity12			1
@entity46 also told the senators that a number of countries have agreed to contribute to the fight against the militants			1
asked whether any of the nations agreed to put boots on the ground to fight @entity38 , @entity46 said no. however , @entity46 confirmed that some of the countries have committed to carrying out airstrikes			1
he did not publicly identify the countries			0
" we will have enough allies " for the military action needed to fight @entity38 , he said			2
@entity46 's testimony before the @entity49 committee came at the same time the @entity66 approved @entity0 's request to arm and train @entity13 rebels to fight @entity38			1
the vote was 273 -156 , with significant opposition to the proposal in both parties			0
the proposal would authorize the @entity8 to provide assistance to " appropriately vetted " members of the @entity13 opposition and require the administration to give @entity77 a detailed plan for helping the rebels before that assistance could begin			2
the @entity49 vote on the proposal could come as early as thursday			0
during the sometimes contentious @entity49 committee hearing , which broke mainly on partisan lines , @entity46 defended the @entity1 policy , saying he did not want to " rehash " debates about the @entity85 and the @entity86			1
" the issue that confronts us today is one which ( all should ) be able to agree -- @entity92 must be defeated			0
end of @entity94 , " he said			0
@entity38 is also known as @entity92			0
what that fight will look like is still in question			0
@entity3 prime minister @entity98 told @entity99 on wednesday that foreign troops are " out of the question			1
" " the only contribution the @entity1 forces or the international coalition is going to help us with is from the sky , " @entity98 told the @entity99 " we are not giving any blank check to the international coalition to hit any target in @entity3			2
" gen. @entity110 's recommendation the prime minister 's remarks came a day after gen. @entity110 , chairman of the @entity113 , told members of @entity77 he has n't ruled out recommending @entity1 ground forces deploy to attack @entity38 targets if the current air campaign in @entity3 fails			1
" to be clear , if we reach the point where i believe our advisers should accompany @entity3 troops on attacks against specific @entity92 targets , i will recommend that to the president , " @entity110 said			2
top @entity1 military officer : @entity1 ground troops to fight @entity38 , if necessary the hypothetical remark , which sources say was vetted by the @entity66 beforehand , managed to undercut what @entity0 and his aides have been promising for weeks : that combat troops were out of the question for @entity3			1
the crossed wires come after a concerted @entity66 effort to spell out a plan against @entity38 terrorists , which itself was a response to the president 's frank admission late last month that he lacked a " strategy " for dealing with @entity38 in @entity13			1
the vow to keep @entity1 troops out of combat extends as far back as @entity0 's presidential campaigns , which were run first on the promise to end the @entity86 , and four years later on the assurance that that era of @entity1 warfare was over			1
while three - quarters of @entity1 support airstrikes in @entity13 and @entity3 , a majority still oppose any combat " boots - on - the - ground " scenario			1
@entity0 : training and intelligence - gathering only when @entity0 addressed the nation last week , he made clear the @entity1 military advisers being deployed in @entity3 " will not have a combat mission " and would act in a training and intelligence - gathering capacity only			1
" we will not get dragged into another ground war in @entity3 , " he said in the remarks on september 10			0
officials are adamant that possibility remains out of the question and say @entity110 's suggestion was using a hypothetical situation -- a practice rarely seen at the message - driven @entity66			2
opinion : what an @entity174 strategy should look like while @entity110 could recommend deploying @entity1 combat forces to @entity0 , the president will ultimately make military decisions himself			2
" it 's the responsibility of the president 's military advisers to plan and consider all the wide range of contingencies , " press secretary @entity178 said tuesday			2
" it 's also the responsibility of the commander in chief to set out a clear policy			0
and the president has been clear about what that policy is			0
" a spokesman for @entity110 , col. @entity192 , said the @entity113 chairman " does n't believe there is a military requirement for our advisers to accompany @entity3 forces into combat			0
" " the context of this discussion was focused on how our forces advise the @entity3 and was not a discussion of employing @entity1 ground combat units in @entity3 , " he wrote in a statement			2
strategy questions tuesday is n't the first time the @entity66 's aim for clarity has fallen short			0
@entity0 's frank admission late last month the @entity1 lacked a " strategy " for combating @entity38 in @entity13 drew sharp criticism , leading to his eventual prime - time address announcing the potential for airstrikes in the country			1
the goals cited by the administration in battling @entity38 have similarly drawn some confusion , going from reducing the force to a " manageable problem " to " degrading and ultimately destroying " the terrorists			0
opponents of the president quickly accused the administration of muddying the message			0
" first of all , the president is just flat not telling the truth , " sen. @entity229 , @entity230 , said on @entity233 's " the lead with @entity232			0
" " we already have boots on the ground there			0
he knows we have to have boots on the ground			0
let 's admit we 're in a war			0

@entity66 approves @entity0 's request to train and arm @entity13 rebels to fight @entity38
@entity46 tells @entity49 committee that no countries have agreed to put boots on the ground
*report* : @entity3 's @entity253 says foreign troops are " put of the question "
president : it 's more effective for the @entity1 to support partners on the ground
