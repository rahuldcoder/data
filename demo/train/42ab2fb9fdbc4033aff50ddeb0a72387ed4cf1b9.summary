president @entity0 responded on monday to @entity3 speaker @entity2 's offer to compromise on tax rate increases with his own compromise on both tax increases and spending cuts , according to a source familiar with the discussions			1
@entity0 's latest offer brings the two sides billions of dollars closer to a deal to avert the fiscal cliff , which promises tax increases on income of all levels and across - the - board spending cuts in the new year			1
for the first time , @entity2 this weekend had offered to accept tax rate increases on household income over $ 1 million , sources said			1
@entity0 , who had stood steadfast at the threshold of $ 250,000 , on monday offered @entity2 a package which would raise rates on household income above $ 400,000			1
the president also offered ground on cuts to discretionary federal government spending			2
his initial offers had included no cuts ; his latest offer cuts of $ 200 billion , divided evenly between defense and non-defense programs			1
the two men met face to face at the @entity3 on monday for 45 minutes , their third such meeting in eight days , a sign of an acceleration in the fiscal cliff negotiations			2
neither side favors returning income tax rates to 1990s levels on all income			2
hours before news of the president 's latest offer emerged , @entity3 spokesman @entity46 made it clear that more work needed to be done			0
" the president 's proposal is the only proposal that we have seen that achieves the balance that is so necessary " between revenue and cost - cutting , said @entity46 , who refused to discuss specifics			0
@entity59 had been scheduled to end its work last week , but legislators returned to @entity62 on monday and leaders warned members to be prepared to stay until @entity65 and return after the holiday until year - end			0
" it appears at this stage -- we 'll see if anything changes -- but it appears we 're going to be coming back the day after @entity65 to complete work on the fiscal cliff , " senate majority leader @entity67 , @entity68 , said monday			0
last week , @entity76 rep. @entity75 , @entity77 , said a deal would have to be reached by @entity65 to allow time for the legislative process to approve the required measure or measures by the end of the year			0
the source told @entity85 that @entity0 's latest offer includes $ 1.2 trillion in revenue increases on individual income and $ 1.22 trillion in spending reductions , though @entity2 's office said the math adds up differently			1
" any movement away from the unrealistic offers the president has made previously is a step in the right direction , but a proposal that includes $ 1.3 trillion in revenue for only $ 930 billion in spending cuts can not be considered balanced , " @entity2 spokesman @entity92 said			1
" we hope to continue discussions with the president so we can reach an agreement that is truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem			2
" a senior @entity106 aide posited that one difference in the math is the way the @entity3 and republicans are handling the consumer price index , which takes into account changes in the quantity and prices of products			0
@entity118 aides estimate that the @entity119 would increase tax revenues by an additional $ 95 billion over @entity0 's estimated $ 1.2 trillion , putting the number closer to $ 1.3 trillion			2
they also do not count @entity0 's estimated $ 290 billion in savings on national debt interest accumulation because they do not consider these savings real cuts			1
@entity0 's plan , @entity118 aides said , does not include a 1 - 1 ratio of spending cuts and revenue			1
@entity0 's proposal includes $ 130 billion in spending savings due to changes in the @entity119			2
it is applied to many entitlement benefits , such as @entity135 , to protect participants against rising prices			0
the chained @entity119 includes assumptions on consumer habits with regard to rising prices , such as seeking cheaper alternatives , and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years			0
labor unions and advocacy groups for the elderly are expected to oppose it			0
@entity2 has been under pressure from the @entity3 , @entity149 , the business community and some fellow @entity118 to give up the staunch opposition to any increase in tax rates			1
conservatives trying to shrink the federal government generally oppose increasing tax revenue			0
they are particularly opposed to higher tax rates because history shows that once rates go up , it is difficult to later reduce government revenue by lowering them again			1
@entity0 and @entity149 argue that increased revenue , including higher tax rates on the wealthy , must be part of broader deficit reduction to prevent the middle class from getting hit too hard			1
the president 's plan also includes one of his key demands on the national debt , a two - year extension of the debt ceiling being subject to periodic congressional votes under the so - called @entity178 mechanism			0
that allows the president to notify congress of a debt - ceiling increase			0
@entity59 could then take no action and let it go into effect or vote to deny the increase			0
without that mechanism , @entity59 would have to approve all debt - ceiling increases			0
an aide to @entity2 said earlier any such increase would have to be offset by spending cuts and reforms .			1
