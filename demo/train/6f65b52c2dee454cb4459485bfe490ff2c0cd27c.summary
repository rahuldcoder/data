-- a bill that seeks to increase prison sentences and extend parole terms in @entity4 for certain sex crimes against minors was passed in a unanimous vote by the @entity8 on tuesday			1
" @entity11 " -- named after 17 - year - old @entity12 , who was raped and murdered by a convicted sex offender this year -- will go to the @entity9 next week for a vote			1
if it passes , it will go to the desk of gov. @entity16 , who has already lent support to the legislation formally know as @entity19			0
@entity12 disappeared february 25 during a jog in a suburban @entity22 park , sparking a massive search that ended a few days later with the discovery of her body			0
registered sex offender @entity12 pleaded guilty in april to killing her and another @entity22 - area teen , @entity12 , in a deal that spared him the death penalty			1
the case set off a firestorm of debate over the management of sex offenders in @entity4 , with @entity12 's parents lending their voices to legislative efforts			2
" the heartbreaking loss of @entity11 earlier this year revealed a broken public safety system , and it called our entire community and our entire state to action			2
with the @entity49 's unwavering dedication and with the good faith of many who contributed to shaping this measure , we 've built a solution that will protect children and spare other families from tragedy , " assemblyman @entity44 , the bill 's sponsor , said in a statement			2
but @entity57 's @entity11 also has its detractors			1
they argue it advocates a one - size - fits - all approach to punishing sexual offenses and that its fiscal implications are too much for the cash - strapped state to bear			0
supporters of @entity11 , which include @entity4 attorney general @entity66 and @entity68 sens. @entity67 and @entity69 , say it targets the worst of the worst with provisions such as one - strike life without parole sentencing and lifetime parole for certain sex offenses against children younger than 14			1
among the crimes that could carry potential sentences of life without parole under the proposed legislation : rape , lewd and lascivious acts on a minor , continuous sexual abuse of a child that were committed during a kidnapping , first - degree burglary or that resulted in great bodily injury			1
offenders could also face a true life sentence for inflicting " aggravated mayhem or torture on the victim " in the commission of the offense			0
the bill also requires lifetime parole and gps supervision with no possibility of discharge for crimes including continuous sexual abuse of a child and certain sex crimes on children younger than 14			1
the proposed legislation also would make it a misdemeanor for a registered sex offender who committed a felony offense to enter any park where children regularly gather without written permission from a parole official or chief park official			1
it also calls for a revision of the @entity4 mentally disordered offender laws to provide for continued detention of offenders where evaluation and assessment deem such to be necessary			2
critics of the bill call it a blanket approach that pushes sex offenders further to the fringes of society without addressing the root causes of sexual offenses			1
" we need to seek solutions to this one shoe size fits all policy and target those who are of high risk to re-offend after being assessed by professionals in the field , as well focus our money and resources into prevention and awareness programs on sexual abuse , and preventing the first crime , " said @entity133 , ceo of the @entity134 , a nonprofit resource center on sex offender issues and a support network for registered sex offenders			1
a preliminary analysis of the bill by the state @entity156 completed earlier this year estimated it would increase state prison operating costs by " at least a few tens of millions of dollars annually " as a result of certain offenders remaining in prison for longer periods of time , resulting in a larger prison population			0
parole operations might also be stretched to their limits , the study said			0
the analysis , noted , however , that a number of variables made the findings inconclusive , such as how often district attorneys would choose to prosecute crimes under @entity11 or the possibility that the law could deter future criminal activity			2
" the long - term nature of the fiscal impacts of some of the provisions of @entity182 further means that our forecasts may not fully account for significant potential changes in prison operating costs and in the size of the population of sex offenders that could occur over time , " the @entity156 said in a letter to @entity177 dated may 12			0
in an interview with @entity0 in may , @entity44 said the projected costs of the bill were relatively small compared with the the expense of maintaining a system that does not seem to be working			0
" we 've tried to create a narrowly focused bill that goes after the worst of the worst by improving upon sentencing laws and guidelines that already exist , " he said			0
" the first responsibility of government is public safetyand if we ca n't protect our children from violent sexual predators then nothing else matters			0
this has to be our priority			0
