-- debate over guns continues to inflame the nation , especially after the mass killings in a @entity6 school late last year that prompted president @entity7 to seek new federal restrictions			1
@entity7 's efforts have stalled , but several states are now redefining their own laws for firearms			1
those measures run the gamut			0
on one hand , @entity15 toughed its gun laws			1
but in one extreme , @entity18 sought to effectively obliterate federal gun laws , which eventually failed			1
the state - by - state battles seemingly favor @entity22 adherents , led by the @entity23 , said one analyst who lives in @entity25 , which this week saw a successful recall election against two state politicians supporting gun control			1
so far in these major controversies , " the gun lobby has won the policy victories , " left - leaning commentator and columnist @entity31 of @entity33 told @entity0			1
@entity18 nowhere were federal gun laws under greater attack this month than in @entity18 : lawmakers sought to essentially void federal gun laws in the state			1
the @entity41 - led @entity40 passed a bill that they said would protect the rights of gun owners , but gov. @entity45 , a @entity46 , vetoed the measure			2
state legislators so far have been unable to muster enough votes to override the veto			0
the @entity18 proposal was an eye opener : it would have technically allowed residents to own a machine gun			2
it also would have made it a crime to enforce background checks or publish the name and address of a gun owner			2
and citizens could have taken legal action against police who try to enforce federal gun laws			1
@entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 pursued similar bills as an apparent backlash against federal gun control attempts			1
@entity45 declared he " has consistently signed bills expanding the rights of gun owners in @entity18 , " but the state @entity41 ' measure was just too much -- an " unnecessary and unconstitutional attempt to nullify federal laws , " in his words			1
@entity81 should the blind be shooting guns ? the issue recently arose in @entity81 when the @entity85 exposed how state law allows blind people to receive permits to acquire or carry guns in public			2
@entity81 's definition of blindness is explicit : anyone who is legally or completely blind			2
federal laws do n't prohibit blind people from owning guns , but some states regulate their ability to acquire firearms			1
@entity98 , for example , requires a " proof of vision " before issuing a permit to carry a concealed handgun : that proof can be a driver 's license or an eye doctor 's statement			2
but the @entity81 law -- similar to one in @entity109 -- divides advocates for disabled people and the police			0
blind singer @entity114 found such gun ownership absurd : " imagine me with a gun , " he told @entity0 earlier this year			2
" it 's just crazy			0
" @entity25 in what some view as evidence of the gun lobby 's might , two @entity119 state senators were kicked out of office in a recall election this week			1
the election -- controversial in itself because it was the first - ever at a state level -- was initiated after the two voted in favor of new gun control laws			1
the new laws , effective last july , limit firearm ammunition magazines to 15 rounds and require universal background checks on all firearm sales			0
the recall was viewed as a battleground between gun rights activists and gun control advocates			1
it was just in july 2012 that a mass shooting killed 12 people and wounded 58 others in a movie theater in @entity146 , @entity25			0
the new gun laws polarized @entity25 along party lines : @entity119 voters supported them , but @entity41 voters opposed them , a @entity150 poll said last month			1
in the recall , the powerful gun lobby , the @entity23 , spent between $ 400,000 and $ 500,000 to oust the @entity119 lawmakers			1
the @entity23 denied it initiated a national effort to oust the two lawmakers , saying it was fundamentally " a local effort , " the group told @entity0			0
@entity161 mayor @entity160 , a billionaire and major proponent of gun control , spent $ 350,000 to keep the @entity25 lawmakers in office			2
gun control advocates , however , charged the recall was successful because of " the shadowy maneuvers of the corporate gun lobby and a handful of extremists , " said @entity172 , president of the @entity173 to @entity174			1
@entity70 @entity70 lawmakers pushed a series of bills that would make it easier and cheaper to own and carry a gun in that state			0
the legislators initiated the blitz on the same weekend that the @entity23 held its annual convention in @entity184 last may , @entity0 affiliate @entity185 reported			0
at least two of those measures were signed into law by gov. @entity189 : it 's now easier for a person to renew a license to carry a concealed handgun , and veterans and peace officer now pay a lower fee for concealed handgun licenses			0
one measure that stalled , however , is a @entity18 - like proposal that would prohibit any state employee from enforcing federal gun laws -- such as capacity limitation or registration requirements -- that do n't exist under state law			1
" the @entity22 is the amendment that keeps the people free , " said @entity206 @entity41 state rep. @entity205 , who sponsored that stalled bill , according to @entity185			0
5 things to know about guns @entity15 a month after the @entity6 school mass shooting , @entity15 became the first in the nation to create new laws imposing mental health regulations on firearm ownership			0
the laws fortify @entity15 's existing assault weapons ban , limit ammunition magazines ' capacity to seven bullets rather than 10 and strengthen rules that govern the mentally ill , which includes a requirement to report potentially harmful behavior			2
@entity225 , @entity6 the postcard - worthy town of @entity225 -- devastated last december by the shootings at @entity229 that killed 20 children , all aged 6 or 7 , and six adults -- is now seeing an upswing in gun permits			0
with 27,000 residents , @entity225 issued 171 pistol permits last year and 209 permits so far this year , on pace to double the 2012 figure			0
meanwhile , @entity6 passed this year new gun laws that are among the toughest in the country			2
they add more than 100 guns to its list of banned assault weapons and limit the capacity of magazines to 10 rounds			0
they also mandate the creation of the nation 's first statewide registry of people convicted of crimes involving the use or threat of a dangerous weapon , among other things			0
nevertheless , the new gun controls prompted some residents to get gun permits			0
" @entity267 did not prompt me , " said @entity263 , a widow and grandmother who lived in @entity225 for 28 years before recently moving to the nearby town of @entity266			0
this year , she got a gun permit			0
" when i started to hear all the gun control talk , that 's what prompted me , " @entity269 told @entity0			1
" our rights are being slowly infringed upon and that this whole idea of controlling guns has come to my backdoor			0
" now she wants to own a gun , she said , because " there may be a time when i may never be able to get a firearm			0
" has the moment passed ? why gun control push fizzled @entity0 's @entity283 and @entity284 contributed to this report .			1

with president @entity7 's gun control effort stalled , states address the gun issue
there is a recall election , a call to void federal laws , a toughening of gun laws
overall , the gun lobby is winning " the policy battle , " a liberal commentator says
