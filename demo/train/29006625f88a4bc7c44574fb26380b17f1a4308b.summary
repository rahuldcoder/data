-- mobile devices are only as good as the networks that serve them			2
but too often , a mobile user will purchase a new smartphone with a two - year carrier contract , only then to learn that the phone gets lousy reception at home , work or school			0
that 's why the first -- and obvious -- question consumers should ask themselves when considering a mobile phone is this : which carriers get the best service in the places where i spend most of my time ? the trouble : this is n't always an easy question to answer			0
yes , carriers all provide coverage maps on their websites that show where their networks are supposed to reach -- theoretically , based on cell phone tower locations			1
but , in reality , signal strength and network speed can vary substantially due to terrain , structures , the typical amount of data - hungry wireless devices on the network in a given location , and other factors			1
when looking for a new carrier , some people attempt to gauge the local quality of a network by finding local customers of various carriers and asking them how many signal bars they generally see on their phones			0
however , this is n't necessarily reliable , since ( as i wrote last year ) signal bars are largely meaningless , and they 're sometimes misleading			0
this is where crowdsourcing can help : mobile users can work together to create crowdsourced maps that show how well wireless networks really perform in specific locations			1
here are two projects that you can actually contribute to , by sending data from an app on your smartphone : @entity61 this project , by @entity62 , collects data via an @entity66 application			1
as you are out and about , this application runs in the background , monitoring the signal strength of your carrier 's network			2
if you have data - sharing turned on for the app ( you can turn it off ) , your data are stripped of identifying information and uploaded to @entity62 's servers			1
aggregate user data are displayed on maps on the @entity61 site			1
i 've installed this app on my @entity84 , and it 's interesting and useful			0
in addition to showing the direction and location of the tower my phone is connected to , and signal strength , it allows me to conduct network speed tests			0
this is important because both signal strength and network speed play important roles in the quality of voice calls and data connections			0
according to the @entity61 blog , " a high ( signal strength ) does not guarantee a good connection			1
you can be communicating really well with the tower but the tower might be choked up -- it might be dealing with so much network data that you get terrible speeds			0
" also , being able to easily conduct your own network speed test can indicate whether your carrier might be " throttling " your data connection , as @entity112 recently said it will start doing to the top 5 % of its customers by data usage			0
the coverage maps on the @entity61 site appear to offer data for major and minor carriers in most regions			1
they do n't offer an @entity125 app , because of differences in how the @entity128 operating system captures signal data			1
a @entity131 app is under consideration			1
@entity133 this project collects data via an @entity125 app. @entity66 and @entity131 apps are coming , the site says			1
the maps on the @entity133 site allow you to compare the performance of @entity143 , @entity112 , @entity144 and @entity146 networks			1
smaller carriers , such as @entity148 or @entity149 , are not shown			0
these maps are a bit simpler to interpret than the @entity61 , and they have user - friendly features			1
for example , they express network speed as the number of seconds it takes to upload or download a song			0
@entity133 users also can view their own personal map with a history of signal strength and network speed			2
both of these projects are most useful in major metro areas where lots of people use smartphones			0
they encourage people to use their apps in other locations to help make their maps more complete			0
although people who use feature phones ( the next step down from smartphones , used by nearly 75 % of @entity181 mobile users ) can not run the apps for these projects , the data on these maps still might be useful for selecting a local carrier			2
in the big picture , projects like these could help hold carriers accountable for the network speeds they advertise , an issue that 's likely to become especially contentious in the next few years as carriers struggle to deliver high - speed wireless broadband to a fast - growing number of data - sucking phones			2
as @entity200 notes , " finally , we 'd have a source of real - world information to counteract the questionable maps we see from wireless providers			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			0

company maps of wireless networks can be *inaccurate* or *lacking* *detail*
application *designers* have turned to crowdsourced data
@entity61 maps has an app for @entity66
@entity133 has an app for @entity125 ; @entity66 and @entity131 versions coming
