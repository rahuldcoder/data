-- nearly nine months after it returned to the sky and its battery system was declared safe , new reports surfaced tuesday of smoke aboard a @entity6 at @entity8 's @entity7			1
the incident " appears to have involved the venting of a single battery cell , " aboard a @entity12 787 , @entity6 told @entity0 in a statement			1
a year ago , overheated batteries aboard two @entity15 prompted aviation officials to ground all 50 of the planes worldwide			1
tuesday 's incident " occurred during scheduled maintenance activities with no passengers on board , " the @entity6 statement said			1
" the improvements made to the 787 battery system last year appear to have worked as designed			1
" @entity6 said it was working with @entity12 to return the plane to service			1
@entity12 and the government 's @entity27 told @entity0 tuesday night that the battery unit was removed from the aircraft to be handed over to manufacturers @entity6 / @entity31 for further investigation			1
the airline told @entity34 that the plane sustained no damage			0
@entity12 is monitoring their other 787s as a precautionary measure , @entity34 reported			1
@entity6 's stake in the @entity6 is huge			2
hundreds of millions of dollars are riding on the success of the 787 , which represents a new generation of lighter , more efficient money making planes			0
when it began service in 2011 , the @entity6 boasted a new battery system that used new , lighter lithium - ion batteries			2
after the planes were grounded , @entity6 and the @entity46 collaborated on a new battery compartment			2
the compartment was designed to insulate the batteries in a ventilated armor - plated box to protect the rest of the plane in case of a fire caused by overheating batteries			2

tuesday 's incident comes nearly two months after @entity6 warned airlines about another 787 concern : possible icing problems in its @entity87 engines			1
the aircraft manufacturer alerted 787 operators after instances of " ice crystal icing that resulted in temporary diminished engine performance , " @entity6 said in a statement			0
although it said only a small number of the engines have experienced the ice problems , @entity6 advised pilots to keep planes at least 50 nautical miles from storms that may contain ice crystals until @entity87 can make improvements to the " @entity103 " engines			0
the @entity6 's development was marked by production delays and other problems			0
then , a year ago this month , batteries were blamed for two overheating instances on a @entity12 787 in @entity109 and on an @entity110 787 in @entity62			1
no one was hurt in either case , but concerns about the incidents spurred the @entity46 to ground all @entity71 dreamliners			0
officials around the world followed suit			0
experts say every airliner experiences " teething pains " during its first few years of service , as minor problems are shaken out			0
but the @entity46 's decision to ground the @entity6 put it under intense scrutiny			0
@entity127 is the lone @entity71 operator of @entity128			0
