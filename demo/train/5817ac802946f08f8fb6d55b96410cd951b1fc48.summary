-- this was a not a normal reserve team fixture for @entity4 second - tier club @entity3			1
for a start , a bevvy of teenage girls started arriving ahead of their development squad 's clash with @entity11 around midday			1
and when the teams finally took to the field , a crowd of around 5,000 fans had amassed for a fixture that would usually attract only a handful of diehard supporters			1
but then , it is n't every day that @entity20 -- one fifth of the most popular boy band on the planet -- is the star attraction			1
a mixture of applause and high - pitched screaming greeted the @entity29 singer , who signed a deal with his home - town club last august , when he was introduced as a substitute			2
try as he might , the 22 - year - old could n't break the deadlock as the match petered out into a goalless draw			1
" just pulling on the shirt is just a boyhood dream , " he told the club 's official website after getting 25 minutes of action in the match that helped support a local charity			1
" it 's absolutely amazing , those boys get to do that every week and it really is such an honor to be involved in a club , where i spent most of my childhood going down to the games			0
" @entity29 were formed through @entity53 talent show x-factor in 2010 and have broken record after record since -- their success stateside even being compared to that of the @entity58			0
@entity20 stars alongside @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63 in the band , who are managed by music mogul @entity65			2
they are the only @entity67 band to have had their first two albums reach @entity69 in the @entity70 and have a combined 98 million followers on @entity72			0
@entity20 's hectic schedule with the band had prevented him making his debut before now , and he spent a month training with the club before wednesday 's bow			1
one previous high - profile appearance in an all - star charity match ended prematurely when he was tackled strongly by @entity80 -- leading to a wave of abuse on social media for the @entity85 star			2
" i had to get fit first , because a few people saw what happened last time when @entity80 nobbled me and that was a bit of a mare and i had to try and avoid that , " @entity20 added			2
" i did alright in the end i think			0
i think its really important that when we are lucky enough to be in the position that we are in , to use that for the greater good			0
" it is really important to spread the word about ( children 's hospice ) @entity99 because they are such a great , great charity			0
" so could @entity20 be persuaded to put his pop career on hold in a bid to try and make it full time with @entity3 ? when asked if it was easier being a pop star than a footballer he replied : " physically it is much easier is being on stage and singing because those boys are proper athletes -- football is harder			1
" to get an insight into the football world has been fascinating and to be invited into that is such an honor			0
" i have really enjoyed it and i ca n't thank the people enough at @entity3 for having me			0
