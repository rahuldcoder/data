@entity0 , @entity1 -- visit @entity1 's number one tourist attraction , @entity4 , with the average tour guide and you 'll probably leave the @entity7 with your head swimming in dates , dimensions and unpronounceable names of kings			1
@entity14 - who ? you might also get the impression , as i did when i first visited two years ago , that the magnificent temple complex you scrambled around in sweltering heat is confined within its sturdy walls and scenic moat , and the city ended there			2
turns out that 's not the case			0
a new report released by the @entity29 - based @entity28 ( @entity30 ) highlighting the results of an april 2012 airborne laser survey -- the first of its kind in @entity35 , covering 370 square kilometers of northwest @entity1 's @entity37 archaeological sites -- has revealed a much grander @entity4 landscape , one without parallel in the pre-industrial world			1
even more sensational , the june announcement of the findings confirmed the existence of a huge medieval city buried beneath impenetrable jungle on a remote mountain			0
re-writing @entity1 's history books @entity48 was the capital of the @entity37 , which was founded in 802 ad on @entity50 when @entity51 was declared universal monarch			1
these days the most popular @entity4 sites for tourists are @entity55 , which is home to @entity56 and its massive carved smiling faces ; magnificent @entity4 ; and smaller temples such as @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			2
but the precise data gathered by @entity64 , a remote sensing laser instrument , reveals that @entity4 was actually a monumental , formally planned and low - density mega-city			1
@entity67 visited ruins further afield , such as enchanting @entity69 , 52 kilometers from @entity0 and sprawling @entity70 , some 120 kilometers away , were actually satellite cities within @entity4 's colossal urban network			1
@entity73 , or @entity50 , meanwhile , 48 kilometers north of @entity0 , has been identified as the location of the medieval city of @entity76 , or the @entity77 -- @entity78			2
this makes @entity4 the world 's largest urban conurbation prior to @entity83 's 18th - century @entity82 -- a revelation that completely alters how experts are looking at the area			1
while the ancient urban network 's existence was mentioned in inscriptions and long suspected by @entity92 archaeologists working in @entity1 , it could n't be confirmed due to the remoteness of ruins already discovered on the plateau , the inaccessibility of much of the mountain and the existence of landmines installed by the @entity100			1
10 - step guide to @entity0 one of the authors of the @entity30 report , @entity105 archaeologist dr. @entity104 , is director of the @entity108 's @entity107 in @entity0 and the chief architect behind the costly @entity64 mission			1
he brought together eight different archaeological organizations , including the @entity1 government 's @entity112 , which manages the region 's archaeological sites , to form the @entity116 , which raised funds for the project and shared data			0
the @entity64 mission was conceived to fill in the blank spaces on the map of @entity4 , @entity104 says , as we slip into the jungle just outside the walls of @entity4			1
" nothing on the forest floor is random , not even a termite mound , " @entity104 explains as he points out anthills			0
" while a lot of the city is buried beneath the ground , it impacts the surface in subtle ways			0
the movements , activities and actions of these people hundreds of years ago remain inscribed into the landscape			0
" none of these lumps and bumps and dips made any kind of sense , but once you see the @entity64 imagery , it 's strikingly evident that what you 're looking at are the remains of a city associated with @entity4			1
" using technology to speed things up out of the sight of the one million tourists who visit the temple - city every year , archaeologists are at work on excavation projects			1
they use found remnants of the region 's rich @entity37 history , culture and way of life to piece together a story that 's continually developing , changing visitors ' understanding and experience of @entity4 in the process			1
archaeologists have worked on the ground here since naturalist @entity173 stumbled upon @entity4 in 1860 , excavating temple ruins deep within jungles for visitors to tour , peeling away vines from palaces for us to explore and unearthing riches to be displayed in museums			1
for many archaeologists , a discovery can represent a lifetime 's work			2
the @entity64 technology changes all that , speeding up the process			0
" what @entity64 takes away is a little of the @entity193 stuff of whacking through cactus , spiders , thorny trees and mud puddles , " says @entity29 archaeologist dr. @entity189 , onsite in @entity0			0
" you can still have your spiders , snakes and bugs , and all those rich experiences , but now you know you 're getting somewhere , which is a lot more satisfying			0
" a taste of that @entity193 stuff awaits our party at 492 - meter - high @entity50 , a 90 - minute drive from @entity0			2
near @entity211 , home to a colossal 16th - century reclining @entity214 carved out of solid rock , my photographer husband and i swap our four - wheel - drive vehicle for motorbikes , riding behind local guides for a daylong bone - rattling exploration of the eight - kilometer - wide and 32 - kilometer - long mountain plateau			0
we cling on tight as our guides , familiar with every cave and cranny on the landmine - riddled mountain , tackle muddy trails up hills , bump over log bridges , fly through fast - flowing streams , get stuck in sludgy puddles and go off - road , bouncing along jungle tracks only they can see , every now and again alighting to slash away vines and branches with a scythe to create our own paths			0
we hike to see enormous carved stone statues of an elephant and lions at @entity243 ( @entity244 ) buried deep within the forest and scramble about the ruins of @entity247 , the three - tiered laterite temple where the @entity250 priest made @entity51 a god - king			2
we emerge from thick jungle to gaze at the red brick temple of @entity254 , grass and trees sprouting from its cracks			0
another day we visit beautiful @entity69 , taken captive by tangled roots and a forest that grows within and around the moss - covered temple , and the remote , sprawling @entity70 , where temple after crumbling temple wait to be explored			0
we see a total of four tourists the whole day			0
insider guide : best of @entity1 " digging " for ruins in the air we also board the helicopter that was equipped with the @entity64 instrument to view the area 's splendid temple - cities and grasp the size of the colossal new cityscape that 's been recently uncovered			1
from the air it 's easier to understand how challenging the archaeologists ' job must have been before the device bombarded the ground with laser beams -- a million pulses every four seconds -- to record data that ultimately provided the precise information that has forever changed how archaeologists work			2
at a traditional @entity37 stilted house on @entity0 's riverside that serves as the @entity107 , i meet archeology professor dr. @entity289 , co-director of the @entity290			1
" i like to explain it like this , " begins dr. @entity289			0
" when you came here you landed at the airport and thought of yourself as driving to @entity0 , then driving from @entity0 to @entity4			1
but when you were at the airport you were really 15 kilometers inside the @entity4 city and @entity0 is in the suburbs of @entity4 ... at @entity4 you 'd be right in the middle of the city and everywhere you turned you would be looking across rice fields and see rows and rows of timber houses with smoke rising from them in the morning and the towers of shrines sticking up through the trees ... it must have been an unbelievably beautiful place			1
" it 's still a beautiful place -- as the one million tourists who visited @entity0 and its @entity4 temple - cities in 2012 would no doubt attest			1
and hotel and tour operators are predicting a significant increase in tourist arrivals for 2013			0
it could be some time before more of the " lost city " of @entity76 's sites are excavated and its temples are made more accessible -- there 's still much de-mining to do on the plateau , too			0
in the meantime , however , locals are hoping the new discoveries inspire more travelers to explore remote sites such as @entity70 and @entity69 , and that the intrepid will hop on the backs of motorbikes at @entity50			1
getting there several airlines fly directly to @entity0 in @entity1 and 30 - day tourist visas are available upon arrival for many nationalities for $ 20			2
most visitors employ a local guide or hire a tuk - tuk or bikes to explore the @entity343 ( open daily , 5 a.m. -6 p.m. )			0
an @entity345 can be purchased at the entrance gate : one - day $ 20 , three - day $ 40 and seven - day $ 60			0
@entity347 offers tours of the @entity4 cities			2
@entity350 offers one - day expeditions to @entity50 and day trips @entity70 and @entity69			0
@entity353 offers flights over the @entity4 cities , including to @entity50 and @entity70 , beginning from $ 90			2

a helicopter camera has changed the way travelers will experience @entity4 and other @entity37 temple - cities
*consortium* of archaeologists brought together to fill in the blank spaces on map of @entity4
locals hope discovery will inspire travelers to explore @entity0 's lesser known @entity37 ruins
