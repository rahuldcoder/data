@entity3 , @entity4 -- " your daughter is a walking time bomb			1
" we have been told this more times than i like to remember			1
we have lived every day not knowing if the next breath she takes will be her last			2
after 22 years in the dark , @entity12 is grateful to finally have a name for her condition			1
her illnesses come so quickly			2
it 's a daily battle of fear , worry , misery , faith and hope			1
she has been in the hospital more than 100 times			1
she has suffered one life - threatening infection after another			1
we share her story , our story , in hopes of helping others			2
we make sure that @entity12 knows this is not just her illness			1
it 's our families ' life , our journey			1
she is not in this alone			2
it 's extremely hard living a life so mysterious that doctors and scientists named her rare disease after her			1
it 's our story about " @entity45			1
" @entity12 was a healthy , nine pound , green - eyed beauty -- until the day she was diagnosed with @entity47			1
hours and days crept by , waiting every four hours for our @entity49 visit , 10 minutes of torture			2
" your daughter is very sick			2
her mind is surely in a vegetated state from the seizures she continues to have			2
the stroke that she suffered has caused the left side of her body to be paralyzed , " the doctors said			1
see photos of @entity12 throughout her ordeal » " she is in a coma and we see no way she will wake up			1
we really do n't think she will live through the night			2
it 's time to tell her goodbye , " they continued			1
mind spinning , stomach churning , feeling like i 've had the breath knocked out of me , i whispered , " no. " " no. we wo n't tell her goodbye			2
and you ca n't either			2
she has to know that we want her to fight			2
" at 13 months , her left eye turned red			2
@entity77 , @entity78 , minor infection ? all easily treated , and cured			2
by day five , after six trips to doctors and emergency rooms , when her eye was swollen beyond seeing and looked like a piece of raw meat , we were finally able to beg her doctor for more aggressive testing			1
surgery , biopsies and a diagnosis			2
her eye would be replaced with a glass eye			2
but only if she lived			2
watch @entity12 talk about her illness on @entity98 » at 21 months			1
the same promises of certain death			1
a 106 degree temperature raged			2
" there is no way that she has the strength to fight off another infection of this magnitude			2
it 's time to let go			1
we 're losing her by the minute			0
" after the first bout of meningitis we were told , " no one gets it twice			0
live your life and enjoy your child ! " then , bout two			0
although not the same type of meningitis , it was the same family			1
it 's rare to have it twice			1
but impossible to have it three times			1
but time three did come			0
" you have to find out why this keeps happening			0
she ca n't go through this again			0
what can you do ? " we pleaded with the doctors			1
they told us it could possibly be immune deficiency			0
this was the first time we heard this term			0
@entity12 was discharged and our journey for a reason began			1
our lives were changed forever			0
twice a week for the next two years , we handed her over for blood to be drawn			1
but nothing stopped the madness of these infections			0
one fever blister on her lip turned into hundreds during a nap			0
she was hospitalized on oxygen as the blisters took over her lungs			0
ear infection after ear infection			0
surgically implanted tubes in her ears , infection , tubes out , surgery , tubes in			0
an abscess the size of a cantaloupe in her abdomen			0
the grueling , sometimes gruesome , immune studies continued			0
the only clue continued to be her low white blood count			0
the turmoil in my heart was insane			0
still we had no answers			0
we traveled the country begging for someone to study her			0
" her body is further advanced than medicine			0
the test has n't been invented yet to define her deficiency			0
" this was the standard answer			0
but , someone had to have a new test that could give us our answers			0
and then the time bomb that we had only been warned about exploded			0
a combination not seen since @entity202			0
" she 's fighting to stay alive			1
five percent chance to live , " the doctors said			1
and then , in an attempt to save her life , they began to amputate her leg			0
before they stopped the spreading , her leg and hip were gone			0
as she lay in a coma , we prayed for help			0
our search for a research specialist intensified			0
that 's when we found dr. @entity224 at the @entity225 ( @entity225 ) in @entity226 , @entity227			1
her immune studies began when she was two in 1983			0
and in may 2003 , we received an email that said , " at long last we have discovered the basis of @entity232 's problem			1
" @entity12 has a genetic defect , called @entity234			1
her body does n't recognize infection and does n't produce the cells needed to fight it off			0
she is still studied at the @entity225 in hopes of finding a treatment or cure for her disease			1
and although finding a cure for her would be the ultimate gift , knowing that we have a name for her illness is the prize			1
we searched for a name for twenty years for @entity242			1
we spent weeks and months with her , in hospital after hospital , praying for her to live through her sickness			0
and to know that we have dr. @entity224 and his team in the background working on her behalf is incredible ! dr. @entity224 did what he said he would do and stayed with @entity12 until her diagnosis was made			1
now the journey continues as we search for a treatment or cure			0
but in the meantime , @entity12 is beginning a career in motivational speaking			1
of her doctors at the @entity225 she says : " they are like my family too , and i get excited about seeing them			1
@entity225 , or ' the @entity269 , ' is just that			0
" a place for families to find hope , just like we did			0

for 22 years , @entity12 suffered from a mystery illness , leaving doctors *speechless*
@entity12 's mother recalls how doctors predicted @entity12 's death *countless* times
in 2003 , @entity12 and her family got what they had longed for : a name for her disease
