-- it 's that time of the year when winter sports enthusiasts dust off their skis and snowboards and get ready to hit the slopes in search of perfect powder and fresh adventures			2
the choice of ski resort is key to that enjoyment and a good place to start might be @entity14 in @entity15 where the @entity16 starts next weekend on the treacherous @entity17			2
the courses set for the daredevil professionals might prove a little daunting for the average skier -- but help is at hand from @entity25 legends who forged their reputation at that highest level , yet still appreciate the needs of the less gifted participant			1
step forward @entity31 , whose approach may border on the reckless but who seized his moment to win the blue riband event in alpine skiing			1
@entity31 's gold in the downhill at the @entity40 of 1994 came as a surprise to almost everyone but himself			1
he sensed something special would happen			2
" i thought today 's the day , i will either win or crash , " he told @entity0			2
" you have to have that sort of mentality			2
looking back i was at the peak of my career			0
" he went on to win silver in the super-g to complete a triumphant games			2
his fellow @entity54 @entity53 is another ski aficionado			1
@entity53 was given a precious second chance of life after a liver transplant and grabbed it with both hands to join @entity31 in @entity25 folklore			1
@entity53 spent nearly a decade on a transplant waiting list after being diagnosed with a rare condition , but it did not stop him competing in the parallel giant slalom event at the 1998 @entity52			1
two years later he underwent successful surgery after a perfect donor match was found and within weeks was training again for his demanding sport			0
" i was so glad that my lifestyle had not been compromised , " he told @entity0			0
earning a place in the @entity54 team for a " home " @entity25 in @entity73 , @entity53 achieved the remarkable feat of winning a bronze medal in the parallel giant slalom event			1
" it was the highlight of my life and i certainly received a lot of exposure because of my condition			0
" to this day , @entity53 remains the only transplant recipient to win an @entity25 medal			1
he went on to compete in the 2010 @entity84 to extend his career at the top to nearly 20 years			0
" i 'm proud to share my story and let people know what is possible after a transplant , " said @entity53 who gives inspirational speeches and runs a foundation ? @entity53 also competed on the professional skiing tour where he raced against @entity31 , who naturally is full of admiration for his feats			1
" @entity53 is a great guy , " he said			1
given their backgrounds and love of the mountains , it is no surprise that in retirement both remain close to the sport , acting as expert guides to groups and individuals of all standards			0
having raced all over the world , both also have a unique insight and a particular view of what constitutes their ideal ski resort			1
given their pedigree and knowledge , they were asked to contribute by author @entity120 to his book , " @entity122 to @entity123 and snowboard before you die			0
" @entity120 , who is based in @entity126 , @entity127 , asked experts , both competitive skiers like @entity31 and @entity53 and influential figures in the sport , for their choices and the result is an eclectic mix across several continents			1
@entity31 spends most of his time at his home in @entity138 with his wife @entity139 and two daughters , @entity141 , who is six , and four - year - old @entity142			1
he is also an owner of the @entity143 in the @entity145 wilderness , where he leads skiers of all standards on heli - skiing tours -- the only way to access 1.2 million acres of terrain			0
by confession , @entity120 is not an expert skier , but his own choice is @entity154 after going with @entity31 on one of his expeditions			1
" i looked down where were supposed to go and must admit i had some doubts , but it was brilliant thanks to @entity161 , " he said			0
@entity31 was renowned for his all or nothing approach			1
it was ultimately his undoing after a serious crash in 1995 on the @entity166 course he had won gold on the year before had a detrimental effect on his ambitions at the highest level			0
but skiing with the likes of @entity53 and other @entity173 stars , he extended his career on the @entity54 professional circuit			1
these days , @entity31 is mostly content to take in the views and pass on his expertise to others			1
" i still ski for myself just a little bit , but i 've got a lot smarter			2
i just liking skiing with business friends , or people hire me to ski with them			2
" his two daughters have also taken to the slopes and although @entity31 would be delighted if they followed in his illustrious footsteps , he is wary of the dangers			1
" it is a tough career and as i know only too well you can get injured , " he said			0
not that his daredevil days are behind him just yet			0
" live life on the edge , or you are taking up too much space , " remains @entity31 's mantra at heart			1
he understands why @entity120 chose @entity154 for special mention			0
" it 's pretty special			0
@entity145 is really vast with so many mountain ranges			0
our little area has 1.5 million acres of our own terrain we can access mainly by helicopter			0
" it 's a wilderness and we can go to untouched mountains with a dream landscape at all times of the year			0
" and would it be @entity31 's own top choice ? " it 's definitely in my top three along with my own selection of @entity212 ( which in the southwest of @entity214 , @entity215 's second - largest island ) and probably @entity216 in @entity138			1
" for the 42 - year - old @entity53 , who lives in @entity218 , @entity219 , there is no place like home			1
" maybe i 'm biased but not only do we have incredible terrain , but @entity218 has a unique history so you can come here to find great skiing and snowboarding as well as big city cultural attractions , " he told @entity0			0
however , as @entity120 notes in the foreword to his book , it 's an entirely subjective judgment			0
for some the perfect setting would offer to chance to match legends such as @entity31 and @entity53 on the same pistes			1
" to push your skills to the limit on dizzying steeps or monstrous moguls , " he wrote			0
" to walk in the turns of some of the sports ' most celebrated practitioners ... for others it might be a few gentle runs on the nursery slopes and good ' apres - ski			2
' " but he is keen to stress that you do n't need to travel to the other side of the planet to experience the sheer joy of snowing or snowboarding			0
" a good dump of snow on your modest local hill can make for a great day			0
yet a trip to a dream venue can create memories for a lifetime			0
" for @entity53 , every day is a great day after facing down a life - threatening condition to inspire others with his feats			2
" i stared death in the face for nearly 10 years on a transplant waiting list and went on to win an @entity25 medal , " he says proudly			1
" it 's about not taking a single turn for granted and enjoy the ride			0
" @entity120 hopes his guide will inspire skiers and snowboarders of all standards to take to the slopes , but knows the selection of the top 50 resorts will be open to debate with so many so passionate about the sport .			2
