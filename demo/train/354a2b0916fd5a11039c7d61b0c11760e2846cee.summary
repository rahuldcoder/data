it 's always a question : will the @entity2 telecast feature performances of the @entity5 nominees ? sometimes the answer is no , but this time ... it 's looking like a yes			1
producers have indicated the frontrunner in that category , @entity8 's massively popular theme to the @entity10 thriller @entity11 , will be performed live during the feb. 24 ceremony			1

this ceremony will feature a special tribute to @entity10 , as part of the super-spy film series ' 50th anniversary , and @entity11 also has four other nominations : cinematography , score , sound editing , and sound mixing			1
the @entity2 will mark the first time @entity8 , who co-wrote the @entity11 theme with collaborator @entity60 , has ever performed the song live			2
" it 's an honour to be nominated and terrifyingly wonderful to be singing in front of people who have captured my imagination over and over again , " @entity8 said in a statement			0
" it 's something i 've never experienced and probably only ever will once ! " although @entity70 is nominated as one of the co-writers of everybody needs a friend from @entity75 , it was performed by @entity76 — another potential draw for audiences			0
and suddenly , the new song added to the musical @entity80 , was performed by @entity23 , who has a @entity82 nomination for the role , as well as a history of turning up on the @entity2 stage			0
