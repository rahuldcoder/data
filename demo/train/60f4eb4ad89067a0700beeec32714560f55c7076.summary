@entity0 -- @entity3 humor has humbled me			1
i thought i 'd nailed it , when i wrote what could be the first original @entity3 joke ever here			1
but since this week 's announcement that the @entity3 particle has been found , there 's been a wave of @entity3 humor on @entity15 , a lot of it curated by @entity18 's @entity17 , whose battle with breast cancer led her to tweet : " gon na start calling my post-mastectomy , science - rebuilt cyberboob the " @entity9			1
" to be funny about something you usually have to understand it well			1
but sometimes it 's the difficulty of understanding something that makes it funny			1
from @ pourmecoffee : " @entity29 : it 's like , a particle , man			1
" science writer @ edyong209 tweets : " a higgs boson walks into a bar			1
the barman does n't understand			1
" and " re : @entity39 , some ppl say it 's silly to put so much money in something few people understand			2
presumably those ppl also avoid banks			2
" @ scullymike tweets : " there 's an easy - to - understand video online that explains @entity3 & creation of the universe , but it 's like four minutes long			1
" turns out @entity53 's a ringer -- he used to write for @entity55 and much more			2
the humor can get a little deeper once we understand that the @entity3 particle is responsible for all things having mass. from the astrophysicist with the mass following @ neiltyson : " the @entity3 discovery makes me feel heavier already			1
" he adds : " what we need instead is the anti-higgs			2
a particle that takes mass away			1
" two punchlines in one tweet			2
@entity71 ! this one from from a joke written by @ sciencecomedian , is making the meme rounds big time : " the @entity3 walks into a @entity76			1
@entity77 says " what are you doing here ? " @entity80 says " you ca n't have mass without me			2
" for a little more context , read the @entity85 ' @ doverbye who , best i can tell , has never tweeted so i had to read the whole article where he writes that without @entity3 " all elementary forms of matter would zoom around at the speed of light , flowing through our hands like moonlight			1
" in other words , without @entity3 , all life would be like a tough day of parenting			1
my favorite @entity99 on @entity15 comes from a guy who dared challenge the rule of never telling more than 3 jokes on a single subject			1
@ afrakt tapped into the public exhuberance over the @entity3 discovery : " wow ! people going crazy for @entity3			1
huge parade down @entity109 tonight ! " and then : " oh come on ! @entity110 's to offer 1800 caolorie @entity111			2
blames physics for obestity epidemic			2
" and " @entity115 rail against the @entity3 as the largest taxing of @entity118 ' brains in history			1
" i figured anyone who can do a @entity122 could be worth talking to			2
so i tracked down @ afrakt , aka @entity124 , assistant professor of economics at @entity126 with a specialty in health care policy			2
@entity124 got his undergrad degree in physics from @entity131 and his ph.d. from @entity133 in statistical signal and image processing which , he explains , means " how to make sense of streams of data using statistics and applied mathematics			2
" but " public policy was always in my blood , " he tells me			0
so @entity124 has been applying the scientific method to health care			0
we @entity118 do n't have a single - payer health care system			0
we have so many health plans to choose from			0
have you , professor @entity124 , been able to game the health insurance system and , if so , can you tell our @entity1 audience how ? " i used to choose my health plan based on word of mouth from colleagues , " he confesses to me			0
" last year , i decided i really should put my money where my mouth is and pick a plan more rationally			0
" here 's the short version			0
" the plans are different in dozens of dimensions , " says @entity124			0
" i 'd have to go through all my health records , which doctors did i see , how much did i pay , what were the co-pays , which drugs did we use , did i have to take my kids to the emergency room ...			0
" he 'd have to assess all of it in light of what he predicted his family 's health care needs would be in the coming year			0
and to top it off -- " i would have to do all that by hand			0
" why ? because there is no comprehensive unified system of health records in the @entity118 and so , professor @entity124 reveals : " i could n't even take step one with this process			0
no way could i amass all the key information in a reasonable amount of time			0
" which got @entity124 thinking about @entity3 again			1
maybe , he thought out loud , we need a piece of technology that does n't exist to solve the problem of choosing a health plan			0
just as the world 's great physicists created the multi-billion dollar @entity197 to smash particles until @entity3 was revealed			1
maybe , says @entity124 , " we need a pretty big tool			0
" professor @entity124 could be on to something			0
a @entity202 for crunching the costs and benefits of our health care plans			0
the power of imagination -- applied to one of society 's great challenges			0
and that 's how you develop a big idea from a few little tweets			0
postscript : after this piece first posted , @ sciencecomedian , aka @entity216 , sent us the video of him performing his ' @entity3 walks into a @entity76 ' joke			1
the joke is 16:30 into the video			0
but it 's best to listen to his whole riff , which begins around 13:00			0

new particle fits *description* of elusive @entity3 , scientists say
since then , there has been wave of @entity3 humor on @entity15
difficulty of understanding something is perhaps thing that makes it funny
