-- a leading football agent fined by @entity2 for using social media has taken to @entity4 to question the fairness of soccer 's global governing body			1
in december @entity9 agent @entity8 was handed a two - month suspension and a $ 8,600 fine by @entity2 for breaching its code of professional conduct as well as its disciplinary code for a number of @entity4 postings			1
@entity8 has used his training compensation page on the website to expose what he says is the unequal relationship between @entity22 's leading clubs and smaller clubs in @entity24 and @entity25 in the way teams from developing countries are compensated for discovering and training young talented players			0
unbowed by @entity2 's sanction , @entity8 returned to @entity4 on monday to ask why the disciplinary committee that had handled his case -- involving 215 pages in total of evidence and the decision itself , 80 % in @entity38 -- had comprised four officials , only one of whom speaks @entity38			1
" and in came the judges -- four			0
a @entity43 , an @entity44 , a @entity45 and a @entity46			0
it took a full month to write the 31 - pages long decision , again in @entity38			0
at the end of the day , i had been suspended for two months and fined , " @entity8 posted on @entity4			2
" how could football executives of this caliber -- bosses of their respective associations -- have reached such a decision without having full knowledge of the contents of the case ? " @entity59 was is presented to them in the @entity61 language ... esperanto ? " in a statement to @entity0 , @entity2 insisted : " the members of the @entity64 were aware , took note and understood all the elements of the case , which were available and presented to them in a language they understand , in order to be in a position to take the decision			0
" @entity8 , who once represented former @entity9 international @entity73 , has been using @entity4 to discuss governance issues surrounding sport , but primarily football , after being inspired by the way social media was used by revolutionaries during the @entity80			1
" @entity82 clubs are ready to pay millions on transfer fees , but when it comes to settling training compensation to @entity25 or @entity24 clubs , it becomes a problem , " said @entity8			0
" clubs know that they will have to pay once the cases reach @entity2 , but until then they buy time			0
" his disciplinary action came after two @entity82 powerhouses , @entity92 's @entity91 and @entity93 of @entity94 , complained that @entity8 had defamed them in @entity4 postings when he claimed the clubs failed to pay the true cost of training a player to the development team , based on @entity2 's formula			1
however , advocacy group @entity102 , which seeks greater transparency within the ruling body , suggested the @entity8 case raised important questions			1
" given the serious allegations of @entity8 , it 's odd that @entity2 would target the person making the allegations of impropriety and not address the alleged impropriety itself , " a @entity102 spokesman told @entity0			2
" any sincere search for truth by the @entity64 should involve investigating the allegations themselves and not silencing the person making them			0
" @entity8 is football 's equivalent of a bounty hunter , taking a hefty commission from the teams he represents in cases he takes before @entity2 to claim training compensation from larger clubs			1
he has extensively detailed his disputes with a number of those @entity82 clubs on @entity4 , and when @entity8 was suspended in december , @entity2 released a statement saying " this was the first time a member of the football family has been suspended / fined for using social media			2
