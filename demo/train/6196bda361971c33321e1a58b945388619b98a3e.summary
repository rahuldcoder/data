@entity0 -- the @entity0 is calling on @entity2 to do more to stop the @entity4 opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates @entity4 's economy			1
@entity4 villagers tend to opium poppies in @entity11 - controlled @entity10 in april 2007			1
the report from the @entity0 's @entity13 shows the export value of this year 's poppy harvest stood at around $ 4 billion , a 29 per cent increase over 2006			1
despite @entity4 security forces ' efforts to curb the trade , 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007 , the report said			2
opium is derived from poppies , and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground			0
the report said opium has accounted for more than half of @entity4 's gross domestic product in 2007			1
@entity33 defines gdp as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time , usually a calendar year			0
according to the @entity0 survey , about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers			2
the rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop , to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade			0
@entity55 , executive director of the @entity56 on @entity57 , urged @entity2 to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade , which has increased dramatically since the @entity62 - led invasion to remove the hard - line @entity64 government of the @entity11 in october 2001			1
" since drugs are funding the insurgency , @entity2 has a self - interest in supporting @entity4 forces in destroying drug labs , markets and convoys , " @entity55 said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey			1
" destroy the drug trade and you cut off the @entity11 's main funding source			1
" @entity79 , a @entity2 spokesman , said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade			2
" we share the @entity0 's concerns , " @entity79 told @entity1			2
" drugs not only poison people , but they poison economies and governments , and it is in everyone 's interest to stop this proliferation			0
" he said @entity2 forces were providing assistance to @entity4 police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly			1
" the issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for @entity2 , but at the moment this is a matter for the @entity4 government , " @entity79 said			2
farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country , @entity79 said			0
however , he said , in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the @entity11 stronghold of @entity10 , poppy production was going on largely unchecked			2
according to the report , @entity0 observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes			0
@entity55 said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals , like acetic anhydride , that must be smuggled into the region			0
he called for tighter controls in chemical - producing countries and stronger intelligence - sharing between @entity4 and its neighbors			0
" drug trafficking is a transnational threat , and therefore national initiatives have their limitations , " the @entity0 drug chief said			1
@entity79 said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head - on			0
he also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor @entity4 farmers to encourage them to give up opium production			1
" you can not have eradication in isolation			0
if we do n't give them the support to produce alternative crops , then by wiping out their opium fields , you are only creating enemies for the future , " he said			0
