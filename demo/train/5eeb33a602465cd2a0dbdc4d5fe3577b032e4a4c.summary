the path to @entity1 , as any spiritual seeker will testify , can be long and difficult			2
unless you take a shortcut			2
whether a trip to the @entity6 just above @entity7 in northern @entity8 -- the hometown of the @entity9 -- offers an easy route is open to question			1
for many reaching the seat of the @entity9 and current home of the self - declared @entity13 is part of a quest for true happiness and a more altruistic way of life			1
for some , it 's a journey motivated by political activism			2
and for others , it 's simply a port of call on @entity8 's hippy trail			1
i 'm heading there to witness one of the @entity9 's teaching sessions			1
the @entity31 spiritual leader holds these around the world throughout the year , but to attend one at his own temple in @entity7 is considered by many to be nothing short of a pilgrimage			1
' @entity38 ' leaving @entity40 station on the overnight train from @entity42 , i meet @entity43 , a 27 - year - old exiled @entity31 monk , currently based at @entity44 in @entity8			2
like thousands of others he 's on his way to listen to a three - day teaching on wisdom and compassion			0
we share the two and a half hour taxi ride up through winding hill roads , dense forests and sparsely populated towns			0
as we approach the @entity6 suburb of @entity7 or " @entity58 " as the locals call it , the traditional orange robes of @entity56 stand out in ever - greater numbers along the bustling , narrow streets			1
" @entity66 's compassion teachings give me strength , " @entity43 says as he leans out the window to enjoy the cool mountain air			2
" that is to say i can feel all sentient beings to be the same as me in their desire for happiness and to reduce suffering			0
" with people from more than 60 countries and simultaneous translations in dozens of languages , the event feels like some kind of global congress			1
burning incense during the event , the @entity9 appears each morning at 8 a.m. , led by plain clothes armed policemen and followed by a small entourage of a handful of monks carrying pots of burning incense			1
he makes his way through the temple courtyards , up two flights of stairs and through the back of the main hall			0
those who get to shake his hand -- i 'm one of them -- talk of an overwhelming feeling of peace and calm followed by a giddy , childlike joy			0
@entity104 , a 62 - year - old sculptor from @entity105 describes her brief encounter as " simply divine			0
" speaking in @entity31 and sometimes @entity107 , the @entity9 begins the first day with a recap on the importance of secular ethics , universal human values , inter-religious harmony , climate change and the importance of preserving @entity31 culture			1
young monks quietly weave their way through the solemn crowds with large , metal jugs of butter tea and warm bread			2
" our whole world is interconnected and the global economy is concerned with the whole world and not only individuals , " the @entity9 says , following his comment with by a deep , roaring laugh that brings a smile to everyone 's face			1
the importance of connection or belonging to a greater whole was evident not only at the teachings but throughout the small hilltop communities in the area			2
touring the neighborhoods amid peace poles , sacred cows and rows of vendors selling everything from mala prayer beads to crystals and macrame , the temple crowds dissipate			0
many of the younger travelers make their way back up the rocky paths to nearby hillside communities of @entity151 and @entity152 at the end of the day			0
along the way , it 's almost impossible to walk past a coffee shop , internet cafe or book store without seeing posters of the @entity9 and slogans calling for a free and independent @entity161			1
while the culture of the towns , @entity7 and @entity6 , are predominantly @entity56 , the small surrounding villages are more @entity165 and attract an international hippy crowd			1
in @entity152 , a village so heavily populated by @entity168 even the shop signs and menus are written in @entity171 , there 's a large choice of yoga workshops , dream catcher classes and programs in @entity177 cleansing -- an ancient natural healing technique in @entity8			0
the jewish community organization @entity179 ( @entity152 village , @entity6 ; +91 1892 221005 ) , has one of the largest buildings in town partly to ensure spiritual experimentation does not lead to religious desertion			0
a typical friday night dinner here sees hundred of @entity168 eating and praying together			0
a break from the all the spiritual adventure can be found at the @entity190 ( @entity191 , @entity6 ; +91 98 1686 9144 ) in @entity192 , a little oasis serving the best carrot cake and vegan chocolate cake in the area			0
how to attend the sessions : all visitors must register with the @entity199 in @entity6 near @entity161 or at the temple first			2
registration opens only three days before the teaching			0
travelers are required to bring two passport size photos and copy of their passport			0
@entity207 passes are issued on the spot and cost less than 50 cents each			0
more details can be found here : http://www.dalailama.com/teachings/attending-the-teachings			0
the @entity9 offers teachings at @entity7 a few times every year but also in different places			1
the next public lectures in @entity7 are from november 11 - 13 and december 2 - 5			1
