-- the @entity1 has slapped sanctions on three firms including a major @entity5 oil trader for selling refined oil products to @entity7 , just days after @entity1 treasury secretary @entity8 travelled to @entity9 to press for @entity5 support on @entity7 sanctions			1
the @entity12 announced late thursday night that penalties would be imposed on @entity15 's @entity14 , the @entity17 - based oil trader @entity16 oil , and the @entity21 - based independent oil trader @entity19			1
while the measures are unlikely to have a big immediate impact on these three companies , they send a strong warning signal to energy companies working in @entity7 at a time when the @entity1 has been canvassing @entity30 countries for more support in isolating @entity32			2
the @entity12 called the sanctions against the three firms an " important " step in convincing @entity7 to change its behaviour , and highlighted the " potential connection between @entity7 's revenues derived from its energy sector and the funding of its proliferation [ of ] sensitive nuclear activities			2
" a spokesperson for @entity14 said the company had not sold gasoline to @entity7			0
" we 've never exported a barrel , not even a wee bit of refined fuel to @entity7 , " said @entity46 , director of the public affairs department			0
according to the statement , the three firms violated @entity1 restrictions on supplying @entity7 with refined oil products that were passed in 2010			2
" under the sanctions imposed today , all three companies are barred from receiving @entity1 export licenses , @entity1 @entity60 financing , and loans over $ 10m from @entity1 financial institutions , " the @entity12 said			1
importing refined oil products like petrol and diesel is crucial for @entity7 's economy because the country does n't have sufficient refining infrastructure to process enough of its own crude into products			0
@entity15 is the biggest buyer of @entity7 's crude oil and , according to the @entity12 , is also a significant source of gasoline for @entity7 , but @entity5 companies have until now avoided sanctions from the @entity1			1
@entity15 supported the most recent @entity80 sanctions resolution on @entity7 in 2010 , and some analysts believe that in exchange for that support the @entity1 may have turned a blind eye to @entity5 companies which may have violated @entity1 laws			1
last year the @entity1 placed sanctions on seven companies for selling refined oil products to @entity7 , but none of those were @entity5			1
@entity14 is a state - owned oil trader based in @entity15			1
the company has a special mandate from the @entity94 to do crude trades that offset military trade debt with @entity98 countries , according to their website			0
ms @entity46 , the spokesperson for @entity14 , said the company would continue buying @entity7 crude			0
" @entity14 's trade with @entity7 is carried out under the two governments			2
the trade accords with international law and @entity5 laws and regulations , " she said			0
" what we 've signed with @entity7 are long - term contracts and we import around 12m tonnes of crude from @entity7 each year , " ms @entity46 said			0
" we 've never exported gasoline to @entity7			0
this is out of thin air ! " the @entity12 said @entity14 is @entity7 's largest supplier of refined oil products , brokering sales of gasoline worth more than $ 500m between july 2010 and january 2011			1
the sanctions are likely to have little immediate impact on @entity14 because the company does very little , if any , business in the @entity1			2
