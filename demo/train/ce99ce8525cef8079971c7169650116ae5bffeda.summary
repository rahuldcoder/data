@entity0 -- it 's been less than two months since president @entity3 signed the bill that will eventually lead to repeal of the controversial ban on gay men and lesbians serving openly in the military			0
and the military is already taking steps to implement the repeal of " do n't ask , do n't tell			1
" the @entity13 released a memo friday that finalizes how the department will begin adopting its policy to the new law , how it will train troops with regards to gays and lesbians serving openly and how it all will be communicated to @entity23 and the public			2
the plan focuses on three tiers of training : -- tier one for experts who may frequently deal with " do n't ask , do n't tell " repeal matters , like chaplains and military lawyers			1
-- tier two for senior leaders who will need to oversee education and training of the troops in their command			1
-- tier three for the rank - and - file , active - duty service members , reservists and civilians working for the @entity13			1
on march 1 @entity41 , the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness , will provide a progress report on the preparation for repeal to the @entity48 , the secretary of defense and the chairman of the @entity51			0
the memo says the " do n't ask , do n't tell " law will not be repealed until , among other milestones , the tier one and tier two training is complete and tier three training is underway			2
at that point , the secretary , chairman and the president will certify the department is ready for gay men and lesbians to serve openly			0
after the certification takes place , a 60 - day countdown begins before repeal is officially implemented			0
that date has not been decided yet .			0
