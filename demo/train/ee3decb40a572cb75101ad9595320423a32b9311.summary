-- there is no word more reviled in @entity3 than " @entity4 , " especially since the death of @entity6 , the @entity7 national who had traveled to @entity8			1
but as @entity4 has spread , it has become increasingly clear that if there is to be any chance of stopping the disease -- not only here in @entity3 , but across the world -- then the @entity3 must lead through inspiring example			1
unfortunately , the response of some institutions that should know better has been anything but inspiring			2
@entity19 , this idea of a travel ban			1
amidst numerous calls for a ban on air travel to and from @entity26 , including from @entity28 gov. @entity27 , it is worth noting that @entity26 is not a single country , but a region comprised of 15 nations			1
and while @entity7 , @entity32 and @entity33 have been ravaged by the disease , @entity35 ( 20 cases ) and @entity37 ( one case ) have contained the disease , while @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and the other countries in this subregion of @entity26 have not reported any cases at all			2
should the @entity3 follow the lead of countries , including @entity48 , which have instituted such a travel ban ? the trouble is that doing so would give us a false sense of security , and at a huge cost			1
in spite of the hundreds , if not thousands , of @entity3 that are volunteering on the frontline to fight this disease , only one infected person has so far made it into the @entity3			2
and while it is true that the virus has also been contracted by @entity6 's caregivers , the hospital appears to have had a golden opportunity to halt the disease in its tracks here , when @entity6 reportedly told staff about his symptoms			0
perhaps worse than the heated rhetoric over a travel ban has been the way some of our academic institutions -- supposedly bastions of knowledge against ignorance -- have themselves been overreacting			1
take the widely publicized case of @entity80 , a school in @entity28 , which reportedly rescinded admissions to @entity35 students based on a school policy of " not accepting international students from countries with @entity4 cases			2
" meanwhile , @entity87 in @entity88 recently reportedly withdrew an invitation to @entity90 , @entity91 ' chief health editor , who was scheduled to speak at the university on the need for good communication during health crises , citing his september visit to @entity26			0
@entity97 for its part has also uninvited @entity100 - winning photojournalist @entity99 from participating in its fall workshop for journalism students , despite his having passed the 21 - day @entity4 incubation period without showing any symptoms and having accompanied @entity106 director dr. @entity105 to @entity107			0
these institutions appear to be choosing to err not only on the side of caution , but of fear			0
more encouragingly , president @entity112 has appointed an @entity4 czar , @entity113 , to help the @entity3 tackle the problem			1
but if he is to make a success of his assignment , he will need to enlist the help of @entity26 communities within the @entity3			1
doing so will require reassuring these communities that they will not be stigmatized , but instead will be treated fairly -- even in cases where there are suspected or confirmed @entity4 cases			0
my own experience working with the @entity124 in hiv - ravaged parts of @entity126 in southern @entity26 showed me firsthand the perils of panic and stigmatization in an epidemic , and how these could drive people into the shadows , even if their illness is not actually related to @entity4			1
as with any epidemic , simple , clear and fact - based mass education is important			0
i was part of @entity35 's virtual @entity138 team that leveraged mobile technology and social media to help create mass awareness and respond in real time to questions , concerns , tweets and rumors before @entity35 was able to contain the spread of the disease			0
the @entity3 , with its huge technological advantage , needs to do even better and quickly embark on a social education campaign about the disease and help to allay concerns			0
ultimately , we must remember that we live in a truly global world , and simplistic measures such as banning flights to and from @entity26 wo n't resolve these issues			1
and welcome as their assistance is , the @entity3 will need to do more than just send soldiers to @entity26 to address the immediate crisis			2
the @entity3 should also ensure personnel are available to help develop social infrastructure , especially in @entity7			0
we are all in this together -- and that is the only way we can beat this virus			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169			0

@entity3 response to @entity4 is *key* for setting global example , *writes* @entity169
but too many institutions are overreacting , @entity169 says
travel ban for flights from @entity26 would be *counterproductive* , he says
