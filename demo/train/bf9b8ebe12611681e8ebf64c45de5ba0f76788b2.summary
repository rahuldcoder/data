-- over the course of my career at @entity4 , from trainee to chief executive , i led two separate lives			1
the first one involved being the public face of one of the world 's largest companies			1
the second was my private life as a gay man			1
when i lied in a witness statement to protect my privacy , those two worlds collided , and i lost the career which had structured my entire professional life			0
i wish i had been braver to come out earlier during my tenure as ceo of @entity4			1
i regret it to this day			0
i wrote @entity24 and set up @entity25 to encourage others to avoid my mistakes , and to bring their whole selves to work			0
that can only happen if leaders , and ceos in particular , create a corporate environment in which people feel comfortable coming out			1
here are six things they can do to smash the glass closet			0
follow the leader set a clear direction from the top			0
businesses must proactively make @entity42 inclusion part of the agenda of leaders , rather than delegating it to the human resources department or to a company network			0
leaders should be assessed against their ability to create a sustainably inclusive working environment			0
as i progressed through the ranks at @entity4 , it would have been odd for a chief executive to devote resources to @entity42 inclusion			1
today , it is increasingly noticeable when they do not			0
be authentic ensure positive messages are accompanied by meaningful solutions			0
@entity42 conferences , corporate networks and pride sponsorship are important , but they are not enough , and seldom have a long - term impact in a company			0
it is the job of a ceo to initiate unremitting , uncompromising and sustainable action , with targets , measurement and sanctions			1
that is the test of a true leader			0
remember the hidden cost of hidden lives make an effective business case			1
@entity42 inclusion is first and foremost a human imperative			0
but it is also good for businesses , which suffer when employees are preoccupied by something other than their work			1
@entity83 , the ceo of @entity84 , told me that he worries about the hidden costs of hidden lives			2
he is right to worry			0
people are happier , more productive , and make more money for their company when they can be themselves			2
straight allies matter harness the support of the straight majority			2
most people are straight , and only they can create a safe space for people to come out			2
by creating an environment of acceptance , understanding and inclusion , the straight majority can ensure that coming out is not accompanied by the disastrous consequences which closeted employees fear			1
that should begin by stamping out damaging ' micro-inequalities ' , such as the assumption that every man is married to a woman , or the practice of not asking gay people about their partners in case it makes them feel uncomfortable			1
small changes in behavior can an enormous signal to someone grappling with a hidden life			0
celebrate role models company policies and behavioral change can create the right space for people to come out , but role models prove that it is possible and worthwhile			2
that is why @entity24 is full of stories , and it is why i set up @entity126 , where gay and straight people can share their stories of sexuality in the workplace			1
if closeted employees can identify with someone who has been through the closet door and succeeded , then they are more likely to let go of the fears that hold them back			2
at @entity4 , i did not have an openly gay role model , nor did i have the advantage of looking to another chief executive for precedent			1
without a gay role model , i failed to be one for others			2
go global look beyond your hometown			0
77 countries still outlaw homosexual acts between consenting adults			0
companies that are committed to @entity42 diversity do not bend their policies , even in the most challenging environments			2
@entity154 , for instance , does not allow its non-discrimination policies to be adjusted in any of the 170 countries in which it operates			0
that sends a clear message to governments , who understand the importance of major international companies for their economies			2
companies can not change the law , and @entity42 employees in these countries must be mindful of the dangers they could face			1
but by creating a safe space for people to be open about their sexuality , wherever they are in the world , companies can help those countries to take a step in the right direction			1
