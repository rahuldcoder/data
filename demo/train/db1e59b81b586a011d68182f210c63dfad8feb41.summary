there 's a movement under way among dads in @entity4 that 's changing what you see on tv			1
across the country , more and more are fed up -- and rising up against the stereotype of the inept , clueless father			1
" we 're not the @entity16 or the @entity17 that we 're often portrayed as , " said @entity12 , who runs the @entity14 blog			0
it 's often the chief gripe among the dads i interview about modern fatherhood			1
@entity23 , father of three , rails against " doofus dads " in ads. in his blog @entity27			1
@entity29 , he calls them " @entity31 's go - to guy			0
" during every commercial break , he says , he and his wife " try to see who can be the first one to spot the idiot husband or father			0
" in a sign of their growing power , dads out to end the stereotype recently scored a knockout blow against a pair of tv ads. a @entity47 ad earlier this year said the company put its diapers " to the toughest test imaginable : dads , alone with their babies , in one house , for five days			1
" what exactly made time with dad " the toughest test imaginable ? " the ad showed dads making some unpleasant faces and ended with a woman saying , " good luck , babe			1
" another @entity47 ad featured a group of dads not changing their babies ' diapers while watching an entire game through " double overtime			1
" angry dads and moms responded with complaints , saying fathers are n't incompetent parents who leave their kids in dirty diapers			1
@entity77 took it a step further , creating a petition on change.org			1
" this was n't just that they had created a bumbling dad character or that sort of thing or just excluding dad , " like so many other tv portrayals , he said			1
" they were using language that was really saying dads are terrible at this stuff			1
on @entity95 , the company praised dads and said its intention was to " break out of stereotypes			2
" and @entity47 officials called @entity77 , giving him a list of steps they were taking to show fathers in a better light			1
soon , @entity47 issued new ads featuring dads caring for their toddlers			1
last month , the @entity107 heaped praise on them for " raising the bar " in how a father was portrayed			0
@entity47 is n't the first to run into frustration from consumers rejecting what they view as an outdated , inaccurate trope			1
@entity116 angered some with an ad about a father who somehow could n't wrap his mind around the concept of wireless internet			2
the image of the hapless dad has long roots in @entity4 pop culture			0
a study of comics as far back as the 1940s found " incompetent " fathers and other mocking portrayals resurging at times across the decades			2
but tv did n't start skewering dads frequently until much later , says @entity134 , director of the @entity135 for @entity136 and @entity137 at @entity138			1
while dads in " @entity143 " and " the @entity145 " had flaws , they were close to what was then thought of as " perfect , " part of an idealized white @entity4 family			2
later , shows such as " @entity147 , " " @entity148 , " " @entity149 " and " @entity150 " showcased caring dads of a new generation , @entity134 says			1
but by the late 1980s , more shows wanted to distance themselves " from the corny , syrupy stuff " -- and in stepped shows such as " @entity157 " and " @entity158			0
" it 's only natural that comedies would take on dads , @entity134 says			2
" comedy is about inversion -- taking people who are in authority and control and making them the butt of jokes			0
" so in a society " that has been so dominated by men ... comedy is naturally going to play against that			0
" dads on tv today are presented in so many different ways that it 's impossible to say things are getting better or worse , he says			1
from the stay - at - home dad in " @entity181 " to the lovable dads in " @entity183 , " relatively positive portrayals abound			2
@entity134 says the growing push for " recognizable " dads who reflect today 's realities are probably to credit for these characters			2
meanwhile , dramas such as " @entity189 " and " @entity190 " show such bad fathers that " you 'd beg social services " to put their children in a foster home with @entity196 , he jokes			2
plus , thanks to modern media , people now can always create their own videos about dads and , sometimes , watch them go viral			2
to some , the idea that anyone would be upset over this stereotype is ridiculous			0
@entity47 ' facebook page has hundreds of posts from women and men saying they found the original ads funny			1
" the problem these days is everyone has lost their sense of humor , " @entity210 wrote			0
and every group of people -- including moms -- gets caricatured and stereotyped on tv			2
do some dads just need to lighten up ? no , says @entity77			1
there 's a growing rejection of stereotypes in general -- and that should apply to dads as well , he argues			2
he 's also concerned that boys and men " see the bumbling dad ... and think that 's what 's expected of them , " the stay - at - home father of two told me by phone while baking chips for his kids out of kale from his garden			0
" they 're not expected to be good , so they rise to the low bar that 's set for them			0
" and it can lead girls and women to have low expectations for how their husbands will handle fatherhood , he says			0
part of the problem , @entity77 says , is that a lot of people believe negative stereotypes really apply to far more dads than they do			1
i ran into that myself last year			0
a column on @entity257 by a stay - at - home father complained that " most " dads " just wan na chill in front of @entity260 with a bowl of chips " after work and complain to their stay - at - home wives about how hard they work			2
on his blog , the writer railed against the " millions of dads who view their days at home as recovery from work			0
" i responded with a long list of studies showing how well dads are actually doing , including this from @entity276 : " almost all fathers who live with their children take an active role in their day - to - day lives through activities such as sharing meals , helping with homework and playing			1
" while by far most of the responses i received were positive , some were from angry people insisting the negative depictions must accurately describe the average dad			0
@entity77 says he received hate mail after launching his petition			1
" there are people who are so invested in maintaining these kinds of roles and stereotypes that they felt like they needed to attack me			0
" but he also heard from men thanking him and sharing stories of custody battles and judges who assumed they were n't as good at parenting simply because they 're men			0
while there 's seriousness behind their complaints about the stereotype , these dads insist they can take a joke			0
" by and large , men are willing to laugh at themselves , " says @entity23			0
" but there just becomes a point where you say , ' ok , the first 400 of these were funny			0
' " and @entity134 of the @entity135 , himself a dad , says he enjoys laughing at these depictions , which exaggerate characteristics of some fathers , even today			0
" as long as there are clueless bumbling men there will be clueless bumbling dads , " he says			1
" i 'm sure there were clueless bumbling cavemen			0
actually , his name was @entity323 ! " discuss this article with @entity325 on @entity95 or @entity326 .			0
