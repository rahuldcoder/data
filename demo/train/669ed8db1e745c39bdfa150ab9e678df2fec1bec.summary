-- @entity1 may have bitten off more than he can chew this time			2
already banned twice in his career for biting an opponent , the @entity3 striker was seemingly at it again in his country 's key @entity8 victory over @entity10			1
just before @entity3 's winning goal , the striker was embroiled in an off the ball incident with @entity10 defender @entity13 with both men falling to the floor			1
and he could be facing a lengthy ban -- despite his attempts to play down the incident			2
" the only thing i know is that those are occurrences that happen on the pitch , " @entity1 told reporters			2
" i just collided with his shoulder			2
they are just casual incidences that occur during a soccer game			2
" television pictures showed @entity1 dipping his head towards @entity13 , and when the @entity31 defender eventually got up , he pulled down his shirt and appeared to furiously indicate that he had been bitten on the shoulder			2
" @entity1 is a sneak and he gets away with it because @entity37 want their stars to play in the @entity8 , " @entity13 told @entity34			2
" i 'd love to see if they have the courage to use video evidence against him			2
the referee saw the bite mark too , but he did nothing about it. , " added the @entity44 defender			2
@entity37 has opened proceedings against the forward , for breach of @entity37 disciplinary code			2
@entity37 added that @entity1 and / or his national association are invited to provide their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant , with a 5pm ( @entity57 time ) deadline			2
the 27 - year - old @entity1 will now face a nervous wait to find out if football 's world governing body @entity37 will take action retrospectively -- given it was missed by the match officials - and punish him			1
but @entity37 vice-president @entity66 , who also presides as head of the organizations referees committee , says he has huge concerns over @entity1 's actions			1
" i have watched the incident several times on television , " he told reporters			2
" there is no doubt @entity1 is a fantastic footballer but , once again , his actions have left him open to severe criticism			0
" @entity37 must investigate the incident seriously and take whatever disciplinary action deemed necessary			0
" according to @entity37 's disciplinary code , the forward could face a maximum ban of 24 matches or two years			1
former @entity31 international @entity85 was given an eight - match ban in 1994 , the longest suspension in @entity8 history , after breaking the nose of @entity91 's @entity90			1
@entity92 , the former @entity93 midfielder , was handed a three - match ban for headbutting @entity95 in the 2006 final			1
while @entity37 has yet to make a decision , @entity3 coach @entity97 insists he did not see the incident when he addressed the press in his news conference			1
" i 'd like to see the images , " he said			0
" i did n't see that			0
and if it happened the referee probably did n't see it			0
so no i do n't have any more comments to make			0
we had more important things than this in a football match			0
" there seems there is animosity against this football player , " he added			0
" he just came out of a difficult moment and he has been penalized			0
there are people hiding behind the tree waiting for something to happen			0
" @entity1 was also backed by team captain @entity122 , who instead blamed @entity13 for exaggerating the entire episode			0
when asked by reporters about the incident he said : " you saw this , really ? " you need to show me because i did n't see anything			0
" did you see it today or did you see what happened in other years			0
you could n't have seen it today because nothing happened			0
" the worst of everything is the attitude of @entity13			0
he 's a great player , with an enormous status			1
it does n't correspond with @entity31 football			0
as sportsmen leaving the field , crying and appealing against a rival			0
as a man he disappointed me totally			0
" @entity147 's 81st minute header secured victory for @entity3 against an @entity31 team which played the final half hour with 10 - men after @entity151 was sent off			1
the defeat led to @entity31 coach @entity153 offering his resignation in his news conference after the game -- but all eyes were still on @entity1			1
the @entity158 , who plays his club football with @entity161 , was banned for 10 games in april 2013 after being found guilty of biting @entity164 defender @entity163			0
he was also guilty of biting during his time in the @entity166 with @entity167 where he was banned for seven games after leaving a scar on the collarbone of @entity171			0
@entity1 's rap sheet is lengthy			1
at the @entity173 in @entity174 , he deliberately handled the ball on the goal - line to deny @entity177 a place in the semifinals of the @entity8			1
he was sent off for his troubles but @entity177 missed the penalty and @entity3 went on to finish fourth in the tournament			1
the following year after his move to @entity161 , @entity1 was found guilty of racially abusing @entity185 's @entity184			1
he was fined $ 63,000 and banned for eight matches			0
last week , after scoring both goals in his side 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity190 , @entity1 hit out at the @entity192 media after claiming he had been unfairly treated over his transgressions			1
" before the game people in @entity190 laughed about my attitude over the last few years , " he told reporters following the game			1
" i want to see what they think now			0
i have dreamed of this moment			0
" @entity1 enjoyed a sensational season with @entity161 -- scoring 31 league goals to help his club qualify for the @entity204			0
he was voted @entity205 by his fellow colleagues and also named as the journalists ' @entity205 too -- awards that reflected a feeling that @entity1 had put behind him his troubled past			0
his participation in the @entity8 had looked in danger when he suffered a knee injury in @entity161 's final game of the season			1
he was forced to undergo keyhole surgery and missed @entity3 's opening game defeat by @entity219 before making a near miraculous return in time to face @entity190 just five weeks after his operation , scoring both goals in the @entity225 side 's 2 - 1 win			1
@entity3 's next game will be against @entity227 on saturday in @entity228			1
meanwhile , @entity10 coach @entity153 says he will step down following another @entity8 disappointment			1
@entity153 , who replaced @entity231 as coach in 2010 , also failed to guide @entity10 out of the group stage in @entity174 four years ago			1
" at the end of the match i spoke to the president of the federation , i have told them i am going to resign from my position , " he told reporters			0
" when there is failure , the person in charge must take responsibility , " added @entity153 , who only extended his contract last month			1
@entity247 , the president of the @entity248 , also announced his resignation while stating he hoped to convince @entity153 to stay on			1
in the group 's other game , @entity219 sealed top spot with a goalless draw against @entity190			1
