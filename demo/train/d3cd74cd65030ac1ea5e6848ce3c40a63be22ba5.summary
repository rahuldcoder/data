@entity0 -- the ceiling collapse that injured dozens of people at a @entity0 theater involved " no criminal act , " police said friday in an initial assessment			1
police said the investigation into thursday evening 's collapse of the ceiling of @entity0 's historic @entity15 , in the heart of the capital 's buzzing theater district , will be continued by the @entity16			1
investigators combing through the wreckage want to know what caused part of the century - old structure 's ornate plaster ceiling to tumble onto the crowd who packed the nearly sold - out show			1
nine people were seriously hurt in the collapse , but there were no fatalities , the @entity25 said friday			1
" it could have been a lot worse -- there were about 720 people in the auditorium at the time , and a large area of the ceiling came down , " said @entity32 's @entity31 manager @entity30			1
three injured people were trapped under debris and had to be rescued by firefighters , he said			1
some of the " walking wounded " were treated in neighboring theaters , he added			2
@entity25 said it helped 79 people , 56 of whom were taken to local hospitals			2
some had head and back injuries , while others had breathing problems or cuts and scrapes			0
images from inside the @entity15 , which opened in 1901 , showed planks , plaster and other debris strewn across the dusty , red plush seats			1
the drama unfolded shortly after 8 p.m. thursday , about 40 minutes into the play , " @entity58			0
" " one of the actors said , ' watch out ! ' " said one woman			0
" we thought it was part of the play			0
instead , it was part of the plaster ceiling collapsing and dropping down five stories onto the theatergoers below			1
' somebody screamed ' " we heard a creak , somebody screamed , somebody from over there said , ' look out ! ' and then the ceiling kind of creased in the middle and then just collapsed , " said @entity72 , who with her husband had snagged one of the last pairs of tickets to the performance in the 775 - seat theater			1
though she said she felt " slight panic , " she credited those around her for keeping calm			0
" it was n't every man for himself , " she said , noting that several of her fellow theatergoers checked on those around them			1
" everyone was looking out for each other , and in a couple of minutes , everyone was out			0
" @entity97 , who was with his wife and two children , said he thought the cave - in was part of the show until something very hard hit him on the head and chaos and panic erupted			0
" you could n't see across the room because of the dust , which we were all breathing in , " he told @entity1			0
" it was absolutely horrific and very terrifying			0
i was with my wife and two kids			0
thank @entity115 , we got out			0
" another theatergoer , @entity116 , said : " my view of the stage was immediately obscured by this dust and debris -- some other people have said it was like an avalanche , and that 's probably a better description			1
" no alarm sounded , but it was clear that something serious had happened , he said			0
" everybody knew that something was wrong and the fear was then that more might come down , so everybody immediately dashed for an exit -- people were screaming -- i was fortunately close to an exit , " he said			0
@entity30 , who said the theater had been evacuated in a swift and orderly way , told reporters friday it was too soon to speculate on the cause of the collapse			2
some observers have speculated that heavy rain over @entity0 earlier thursday evening might have played a part			0
the @entity15 is on @entity144 near @entity145 , in @entity0 's @entity147 district , which is usually packed with tourists , shoppers and diners at theater time			1
the area around it was cordoned off after the collapse as bloodied and dust - covered theatergoers stumbled onto the street			1
the local @entity0 authority , @entity16 , said friday morning that the @entity15 's roof is now " secure , " but what led it to give way was not known			1
historic theaters are required to undergo rigorous roof safety checks every three years , the council said			0
' a freak , unusual accident ' many people with tickets for shows over the busy holiday period will want to know that they are not at risk of falling victim to a similar offstage drama			1
there are nearly 50 major theaters in the @entity175 of @entity0 , of which 26 are at least 90 years old			0
the @entity176 , which represents the theater industry in the capital , sought friday to reassure those alarmed by the events			1
" our theatres entertain over 32,000 people in central @entity0 every night and all theatres take the safety of their audience , performers and staff very seriously , " it said in a prepared statement			0
" every theatre undergoes rigorous safety checks and inspections by independent experts , and incidents like last night are extremely rare			0
" the society 's president , @entity195 , told @entity1 on friday there had been no warning of any problem with the @entity15 's ceiling			1
" it was a freak , unusual accident -- we have no idea what caused it , " he said			1
" obviously our sympathies are with anyone who was injured or affected by it			2
" @entity195 said he did not anticipate the incident would affect @entity0 's " booming " theater business			1
" i do n't expect it 's going to change anything , " he said			2
" all of the other theaters are open tonight			0
we are expecting business as usual			0
it 's the holiday season , it 's a very busy time of year and we expect our theaters to be full			2
" @entity0 mayor @entity217 had a similar message			0
" whilst this was a serious incident , @entity0 's world renowned theatreland is open for business , and thousands of theatregoers will rightly be out and about tonight and over the weekend , " he said in a prepared statement			1
" @entity58 , " which was adapted for the stage from the 2003 mystery novel by @entity232 writer @entity231 , is about a 15 - year - old boy 's investigation into the death of a neighborhood dog			2
@entity231 tweeted thursday night of his relief that the situation was no worse			2
" it 's been horrifying sitting here watching what has been happening at the apollo this evening			2
i 'm hugely relieved that no - one has died , " he said			0
performances of the play were canceled through saturday , the @entity176 said			1
it was not clear what would happen for future shows			0
@entity247 , which owns the @entity15 , is " working closely with the relevant authorities to establish exactly what happened , " the society said			1
@entity1 's @entity248 reported in @entity0 ; @entity249 wrote and reported in @entity0 and @entity250 in @entity251			2
