@entity0 -- dozens of @entity6 workers angry over a pay dispute have held their @entity3 boss hostage for five days , the @entity3 businessman said			1
@entity9 , co-founder and president of @entity11 , has been trapped in the company 's suburban @entity0 factory since friday			1
he told @entity1 it 's all because of a misunderstanding about layoffs and severance packages			2
" i tried to leave a day and a half ago , and there was like 60 or 70 of them here inside every entrance , and every exit was barricaded , " @entity9 said tuesday from behind the gates of the factory			1
" i ca n't go anywhere			0
" @entity9 was calm but looked haggard , wearing the same blue jeans and a blue shirt that he said he has been wearing since last week			1
the incident started when the company laid off about 30 workers in its injection molding division			2
he said he transferred workers to another division , but some workers did not want to move			1
so the company gave them severance packages			2
@entity9 said the problem came when workers who already moved to another division also wanted severance packages			1
but workers who spoke to @entity1 from behind the factory gates gave an entirely different account			0
some said they 're owed two months ' worth of back pay and feared everyone at the plant would be laid off , as they claimed no new materials had entered the factory			1
" there are no outstanding balances			0
there is no reason to be doing this other than bad information , " he said			0
" the wrong information got out			0
i am in the process of trying to fix that , but the demands and the amount of money that it is taking to do that puts the company in a bad situation , so there has got to be some compromise			0
" about four police officers at the scene would not comment on the situation			0
@entity3 embassy officials in @entity0 met with @entity75 on monday and confirmed he is safe and is close to reaching an agreement , spokesman @entity73 said			1
he said the executive has access to attorneys			0
@entity9 said the employees have n't caused any physical harm but have disrupted his sleep by banging on doors and windows			1
he has a cot and is receiving three meals a day , said @entity86 , the @entity3 president of @entity11			2
@entity86 said the company has offered protesting employees a lesser severance package if they want to leave			2
but he said the 80 to 100 employees at odds are demanding about $ 500,000 -- which would bankrupt the company			0
@entity1 's @entity94 contributed to this report .			0
