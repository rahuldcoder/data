-- sometimes a number can put a complicated truth in simple terms			0
here 's one : 20 %			0
a child whose family budget is controlled by the mother is 20 % more likely to survive			1
why ? women know what 's best for their families			1
they make health care , nutritious food and education priorities			1
but most women in developing countries do n't control household budgets , and many also do n't control the circumstances of their own lives			1
if women everywhere had the power to determine their futures , the world would be forever transformed			1
this week i will attend the @entity26 conference in @entity27			0
i 'll be joined by more than 3,000 people who have dedicated their careers to empowering women and girls			1
the specifics of our work differ , but we 're all united by a single , powerful idea : empowered women and girls will save lives , make families more prosperous and help the poorest countries in the world build stronger economies			1
once you have a child , your career is over ? absolutely not one key to empowerment — and an issue that 's a personal priority for me — is letting women decide when to have children			2
right now , more than 200 million women around the world say they do n't want to have a child but are not using contraceptives			1
some of these women will die from complications of pregnancy			2
some will give birth to a child who dies			0
many mothers who survive ( and have children who survive ) wo n't have the resources to feed or educate them			2
more : @entity0 's ' girl rising ' take , for example , a girl in @entity66 , where 75 % of girls are married before their 18th birthday			0
of course , @entity66 is small and has the highest rate of child marriage in the world , but there are large countries ( including @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , with a total of 1.5 billion people ) where more than 40 % of girls become brides			2
what happens to a child bride from one of these countries ? if she ca n't use contraceptives , she gets pregnant , leaves school and probably never goes back			2
if she continues having children one after the next — " one on the back and one in the belly , " as women have said to me — her health will deteriorate , along with the health of her babies			1
by the time her children are school age , they are likely to be malnourished and stunted , so even if they go to school , they wo n't be ready to learn			2
unfortunately , there 's a real probability that this very same cycle will start again			2
however , if these girls do n't get pregnant and are able to stay in school , everything changes			2
their children will be healthier			0
because they finished their schooling , they will be able to earn more money			0
that money will stretch further , because they will be supporting a smaller family			2
their children will be set up to lead a better life than they did , which is the goal of every parent i know			0
more : @entity117 's open letter to girls of the world last year , at the @entity120 , the world came together on a goal to reach 120 million more women and girls around the world with the family planning options they want for their families			1
since then , almost two dozen countries have developed plans to make sure women have access to contraceptives			0
family planning is just the start			0
women who have the power to decide when to get pregnant also must have the power to vaccinate their children , feed them healthy food and pay their school fees			1
each of these things is a link in a chain of good health and prosperity			1
the vast majority of the world 's poorest people farm small plots of land to grow their food and earn an income			0
women do the majority of the agricultural work across @entity155 and @entity156 , but they do n't have equal access to information and farm supplies			1
as a result , plots of land worked by women generate lower yields than plots worked by men — as much as 40 % lower			0
if women can get the right training , high - quality seeds and access to irrigation and fertilizer , they will be able to grow more and more nutritious food while producing a surplus they can sell for a profit			1
those are resources they can convert into a better life for their children			0
@entity26 is organized around the conviction that women and girls can start a virtuous cycle of development			1
they just need a little support to get it started			0
they need to be able to plan their pregnancies			0
they need to be able to grow enough food to support their families			0
once these basics are in place , the only limit is women 's ambition for the future			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			1

@entity202 : in developing world most women do n't control home budgets , **reproduction**
she says when they do , kids fare much better on health , education , prosperity .
she says giving women power over **reproduction** , vaccination breaks cycle of *mortality*
gates : proper training gives women edge in agriculture ; this converts to better life for family
