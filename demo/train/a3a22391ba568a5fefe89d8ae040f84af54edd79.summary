a spate of car bombings rocked @entity2 on tuesday , the ninth anniversary of the @entity5 invasion and days before the nation hosts a meeting of @entity9 leaders			1
the violence left at least 45 people dead and 216 wounded , officials said			1
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the blasts that one senior @entity17 official described as " coordinated " and blamed on @entity18 in @entity2			1
the official , who did not want to be named because he 's not authorized to speak to the media , said the attacks were meant to send a message that the militant group -- despite gains made by @entity2 security forces -- is still able to carry out daily attacks			1
attacks took place in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity39 province , @entity40 province , @entity41 and @entity42			0
some of them targeted police or government facilities			0
in central @entity37 , a pregnant woman was killed and her 6 - year - old child wounded by bombs insurgents planted around a house belonging to a police officer , police in the city said			0
in @entity33 , a car bombing outside a school wounded four teachers			0
the attack in @entity32 targeted a juvenile detention center ; two attacks in @entity31 targeted police stations ; an army convoy was attacked in @entity35 ; and a parked car exploded in front of the @entity64 in @entity29 , officials said			2

the minister of state , government spokesman @entity70 announced that the @entity71 has decided that @entity29 will observe a national holiday , @entity69 reported			1
it will begin on sunday , said state tv			0
the violence is the worst since february 23 , when 50 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded in a string of attacks			2
@entity2 officials have expressed concern that the continuing violence could cast a shadow as the country prepares to host the next @entity85 summit on march 29			1
the attacks on tuesday come nine years to the day since a @entity5 - led army invaded @entity2 on march 20 , 2003 , toppling longtime dictator @entity88			1
the @entity5 argued @entity88 's regime had been harboring forbidden stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons , long - range missiles and a nuclear weapons program			2
inspectors later found that @entity29 had attempted to conceal some weapons - related research from the international community , but that @entity2 had been effectively disarmed under @entity100 sanctions in the 1990s			0
the invasion swiftly toppled @entity88 , who was later executed for the massacre of @entity104 villagers following an assassination attempt in the 1980s			0
but years of bloodshed followed the invasion as an insurgency led by @entity88 's allies took root , followed by sectarian warfare between @entity2 's @entity104 majority and its @entity114 minority			2
nearly 4,500 @entity5 and 300 - plus allied troops were killed before the last @entity5 troops left in december , while estimates of the @entity2 toll run well above 100,000 .			1
