-- new details have emerged about a @entity3 immigrant who fled @entity4 as @entity5 was brewing , lived frugally in @entity6 and left an estate whose size -- $ 300,000 -- astounded some			1
@entity9 fled @entity4 in 1938 for the @entity10 and married @entity11 , who earned money performing odd jobs			2
in a story published monday , @entity0 and other news organizations reported neither the woman 's name nor much else about her , except for the fact that she had donated half of her estate to @entity23 in @entity24 , a school with which she had had no known contact			1
since then , @entity0 has contacted two of her friends and a relative , who have identified her as @entity29 , who was born @entity9 in 1911 in @entity30			1
they said she was neither a concentration camp survivor nor had she ever been homeless , as the school originally reported			2
her life story , however , was still remarkable			2
in 1938 , she , her mother , her sister and her sister 's husband fled @entity4 , said @entity38 , a @entity3 collectible coin and banknote wholesaler who lived on @entity42 and befriended @entity29 20 years ago , when she lived a block away			1
the @entity44 made their home in @entity6 , where they had relatives			1
the 5 - foot - 2 - inch immigrant married @entity11 , another @entity4 , who earned money performing odd jobs			2
the couple lived with @entity29 's mother ; @entity29 earned money from a variety of office jobs			1
@entity29 , who was in her mid- 70s when @entity38 met her in the late 1980s , gave the impression that she was just scraping by , he said			1
" she hung around on the street and talked to everybody and people gave her food and clothes , " he said			2
" she was very thrifty			2
" she once traveled with her mother to @entity62 , but did not appear particularly religious , @entity38 said			2
@entity63 , who met @entity29 nearly 40 years ago upon his arrival in the @entity10 from @entity65 by way of @entity67 , disagreed , saying his friend observed all the high holidays			1
" i used to take her to the synagogue , " said the hair colorist who has a shop on the @entity72 and cut @entity29 's hair for free			1
he received 25 percent of her estate			2
" she was a great believer in @entity78			2
" he described her as " a free spirit			0
" " she would say she liked weak men and strong coffee , " he said			0
" she was always being taken out to eat by one person or another ; people bought her things , bought her food , bought her newspapers			0
but she was n't a down - and - out bag lady with a pushcart like the people in the movie			0
she was very neat , clean and she was a decent person			0
" he said her penny pinching was understandable " because she lived through the @entity95			2
" @entity38 said that , throughout the years he knew @entity29 , she lived on east 31st street in a 10th - floor , sparsely furnished one - bedroom apartment in a building for senior citizens			1
her rent -- about $ 145 per month -- was even lower than it would have been because she reported housing code violations in her apartment to authorities , who then declined to approve rent hikes , @entity38 said			1
but @entity29 spent much of her time outside the building , where she sat on a bench dressed in old clothes and carried on a busy social life			1
" everyone knew her , " he said			0
" everybody in the diner on the corner knew her			0
" among her coterie was @entity114 , who played @entity115 on " @entity116 " and lived on the block , he said			2
neighbors would sometimes give her items they no longer wanted			2
@entity29 's frugality was legend : she recycled greeting cards , crossing off the name of the original recipient and replacing it with the new one			1
" she 'd write on the top of it : ' from @entity9 , ' " @entity38 said			0
instead of paying extra to get an unlisted telephone number , she simply listed it under someone else 's name , he said			0
occasionally , @entity38 , now 74 , would treat his neighbor to a meal at the diner or a nearby delicatessen , where her favorite dishes included lox			0
though she was not thin , she would rarely finish what was on her plate			0
" a lot of it , she would take home , " he said			0
" she 'd take all the sugar and all the napkins ; she 'd bring extra jars to take coffee home in			0
" he always picked up the tab			0
" there was never any question , " he said			0
" i do n't think she ever bought anything			0
" @entity38 , who was also born in @entity4 , helped @entity29 increase her monthly pension from the @entity4 government			1
he also helped her augment her income , giving @entity29 $ 5 to sit in his @entity155 on days when the street sweeper went by so that he would not get a parking ticket			1
one day , @entity29 asked @entity38 about a flier she had received offering to help residents write their will for free			1
" i looked into it and i found that this was the @entity164 ; they would send a lawyer who would take two students to people 's houses and do their wills , so i said , ' it 's ok			0
' " @entity29 asked @entity38 to serve as executor and he agreed			1
she also told him that she would leave him money , but @entity38 was unimpressed			0
" i never thought she had any real money , " he said			0
" she was enough of a pest that i told her , ' no , i do n't want it			0
' " she took him at his word			0
instead , she left a quarter of her $ 300,000 estate to @entity38 's wife , @entity182 , a quarter to @entity63 and half to @entity23 , where a spokesman said the school was grateful for the donation , but had no idea what inspired it			1
though @entity29 remained alert until the end , she faltered physically during her final months , when she " very reluctantly " hired a woman to take care of her			1
" she did n't want to pay for it , " @entity38 said			0
@entity29 died in 2007 of heart failure , he said			1
@entity38 said @entity29 had told him she had no relatives , but he discovered after her death that she had not been truthful			1
" it turned out there was a sister and a nephew that she was n't on speaking terms with , " he said			0
even after @entity29 died , @entity38 continued to learn about his friend 's penurious ways			1
when he went to a bank to carry out his duties as executor of the will , a vice president told him @entity29 had taken advantage years before of a promotional offer of a year 's free access to a safe deposit box , @entity38 said			1
but after the year elapsed , she refused to pay the $ 100 annual fee , he said			2
so the banker told him he kept @entity29 's @entity216 savings bonds for $ 60,000 in his desk drawer , @entity38 said			1
though the size of her total savings surprised him , @entity38 said her dogged thrift could have explained it			0
he calculated that -- between her pension from @entity4 and her $ 800 monthly check from @entity225 -- her monthly income was about $ 2,000 , of which she spent only about $ 500			2
@entity29 's sister -- from whom she had long been estranged -- died a few months ago , said @entity29 's nephew , @entity229 , who lives in @entity230 , @entity231			1
he said he last saw his aunt more than three decades ago at a family get - together			0
" she was a live wire , " quick to pound out a waltz on the piano or to dance			0
he was not surprised at the sum of her savings : " she worked all her life and she did n't live high			0
so i do n't think that 's all that unusual			0
" @entity0 's story published monday quoted a spokesman for the school as saying @entity29 had survived a concentration camp and lived homeless on the streets of @entity6			1
her friends and her nephew said neither was true			2
on friday , school spokesman @entity252 said the discrepancies were the result of a miscommunication			0
@entity23 " regrets misinterpreting the facts about @entity9 's amazing and generous story , " he said			1
" what is clear is that @entity9 was a remarkable woman who has made a difference by supporting research and education at the @entity23 , something that will have an impact far beyond the borders of the state of @entity62			1
