-- reputed mob boss @entity1 , visibly annoyed , muttered under his breath " you 're a f --- ing liar " thursday as a disgraced former @entity6 supervisor testified that there was " no question " the @entity10 gangster doubled as an informant for @entity6 @entity12			1
prosecutor @entity13 requested that the judge in @entity1 's federal trial advise @entity1 to " keep his little remarks to himself , " which judge @entity18 advised shortly after			1
both sets of attorneys have spent a remarkable amount of time during the trial of the notorious @entity1 , charged with 19 murders and in court after living in hiding for 16 years , trying to prove whether @entity1 was an informant during a 15 - year period			1
even judge @entity27 is beginning to question the importance of the issue			0
during post-court discussion over motions , as the defense was attempting to further it 's argument that @entity1 's informant records were forged by his @entity6 handler , judge @entity27 questioned , " how does that address that your client is not guilty of crimes here ? " @entity1 's attorney @entity39 danced around the question and responded , " @entity1 was not providing information as an informant , he was providing money so that he 'd get tipped off about wire taps and search warrants			1
" @entity1 's attorneys have been quick to admit to acts of extortion and racketeering -- charges @entity1 is also facing -- to defend their client 's position that he was not another " rat " from @entity12			2
" why ca n't both be true ? " judge @entity27 inquired			0
" the defendant 's position is ( that ) only one is true			0
" why would @entity56 be paying all this money to all these people if the government 's theory is he got all this protection because he was providing information			0
why would he keep paying everybody ? " former @entity6 supervisor @entity64 , an addition to the government 's long list of cooperating witnesses , testified thursday that he took bribes from @entity1 in the amount of $ 7,000 , along with a silver - plated champagne bucket and two cases of imported wine			1
@entity64 said he asked @entity1 if he could " spring " for a plane ticket for his secretary girlfriend to visit him during @entity6 training in @entity77 , and @entity1 obliged			1
@entity64 admitted to his acts of corruption in 1997 in exchange for immunity			0
a sheepish , red - faced @entity64 , though less than six feet away from @entity1 , avoided eye contact with the defendant , who glared steadily at his old confidant throughout his testimony			1
this is the first time the two have seen each other since they cut ties in 1991 after @entity64 leaked @entity1 's informant status to the @entity91			2
@entity64 said he first met @entity1 at a dinner he hosted his @entity95 , @entity94 , home in 1978 along with @entity1 's @entity6 handler @entity96 , whom he characterized as his " best friend			1
" @entity64 said he met @entity1 and later his associate @entity99 " @entity98 eight to 10 times in various places , including @entity64 ' home , @entity64 ' girlfriend 's apartment , a hotel , @entity1 's home and even in @entity109 's mother 's house for dinner			2
the defense has previously argued that @entity1 was not treated like an informant , and thus did not believe that he was			2
@entity64 testified that @entity96 preferred to meet @entity1 in " pleasant surroundings , not the type of surroundings you would meet a normal informant , " like in a hotel or car			2
" he wanted mr. @entity1 to be comfortable , " @entity64 said			2
@entity64 was supervisor to rogue @entity6 agent @entity96 , who is currently serving a 40 - year sentence on second - degree murder charges for leaking the identities of witnesses cooperating against @entity1 's @entity126			1
@entity109 , serving a life sentence , is set to testify against @entity1 later in this trial after agreeing to cooperate with the government to evade the death penalty in 1997			2
all that @entity1 and @entity109 wanted from their handlers in exchange for information was " a head start , " as @entity64 described -- to be tipped off if they were going to be indicted or charged so they could flee			1
the pair , according to @entity64 , knew they were " fair game " and acknowledged that they were engaging in criminal activity and at some point they might get charged			0
if that happened , they did n't want their identity as informants disclosed and would rather " take the risk " @entity64 said			0
@entity64 admitted to tipping his informants off to wire taps , and keeping their names out of a 1975 horse race indictment			0
he testified that the @entity154 , or @entity155 , was the main priority of the @entity6 in @entity12 and that @entity1 and his partner @entity109 were instrumental in the take - down of those mobsters			1
the two provided the agents with a drawing of mafia headquarters , and that was used to take down the @entity154 in a 1983 sting			0
after being tipped off to an indictment , @entity1 went on the run for 16 years and landed himself on the @entity6 's top 10 most wanted list before being arrested in his @entity169			1
@entity170 , home with his girlfriend in 2011			0
@entity64 said that he signed off on reports @entity1 provided to the @entity6 that he knew were false lies to protect himself from being implicated as the person to who leaked sensitive information that may have tipped @entity1 off to witnesses that were cooperating against him			1
those potential witnesses were eventually murdered , @entity64 said , and @entity1 has been charged in their killings			1
while the defense had little time to cross-examine @entity64 , who will be back on the stand friday , defense attorney @entity182 painted @entity64 to be a liar , an adulterer , and a fraud			0
he was able to fire off a question that is likely to resound with the jury			0
" you were corrupt , were n't you mr. @entity64 ? " @entity182 queried			0
" yes , " @entity64 exhaled after a long pause and a deep breath .			0

a former @entity6 agents is asked : " you were corrupt , were n't you ? "
" yes , " comes the answer from agent , who is testifying against " @entity1
reputed mob boss @entity1 is charged with 19 murders
he lived in hiding for 16 years , after a tipoff from an @entity6 source that he faced indictment
