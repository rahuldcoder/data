-- the jury weighing the fate of a white @entity4 man accused of killing a black teen during an argument over loud music concluded its second day of deliberations thursday after asking a judge for details about a letter written in the months after the shooting			1
the jury was scheduled to resume deliberations friday at 9 a.m. et. the question was the latest posed by the jury considering the evidence in the case against @entity18 , who says he acted in self - defense when he opened fire on four teenagers in an suv in @entity23 in november 2012			1
prosecutors contend it was an act of murder			2
@entity18 has been charged with first - degree murder in the killing of 17 - year - old @entity29			1
he also has been charged with three counts of attempted murder			2
if @entity18 is found guilty , he faces up to life in prison			1
the questions came during the second day of deliberations in a case that has drawn parallels to the trial of @entity40 in the killing of teenager @entity42 , which also had racial overtones and claims of self - defense			1
jury questions among the requests from the jury was to see surveillance video from the gas station where @entity18 shot @entity29			1
the video contains 20 minutes of footage from multiple angles , though a shorter version showing only one angle was slated to be shown in court			2
the jurors posed another question later in the day : " can we get that dummy with the sticks ? " -- a reference to a flexible mannequin and three dowels used to demonstrate the angles of the bullets as they entered @entity29 ' body			1
judge @entity68 said he 'd grant the request if both the prosecution and defense agreed , but after examining the dummy , defense attorney @entity72 said he felt the dowels in the body had been repositioned and objected to the jury seeing it again			2
then the jury asked the judge when the letter was written			2
the answer : june 2013			0
in closing arguments wednesday , prosecutors said inconsistencies between @entity18 's words and actions undermined his assertion he acted in self - defense when he fatally shot the teen			1
his attorney countered the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his client was guilty			2
he pleaded with jurors to find @entity18 not guilty			1
in testimony tuesday , @entity18 said he fired in self - defense after the teen threatened him with a gun			1
" my intent was to stop the attack , not necessarily end a life , " he said			2
" it just worked out that way			0
" defendant says he was ' crazy with grief ' ' there was no gun ' but assistant state attorney @entity107 said wednesday that @entity18 's claims do n't add up			1
she noted that @entity18 fired 10 shots at the suv , three of them while the car was fleeing			1
he never took cover -- but instead opened his car door -- even though he would later tell detectives he had seen a weapon , she said			0
" there was no gun , " @entity107 told jurors			0
in addition , she said , he did not tell his fiancee , @entity29 , that he had seen a weapon until more than a month later			0
@entity18 also left the scene of the shooting , went back to a hotel where they were staying and walked his dog , she said			1
and he returned the next day to his house -- more than two hours away -- all without calling 911 , @entity107 said			2
" this defendant did n't tell anyone because he thought he had gotten away with murder , " she said , adding that @entity18 had no idea a witness had taken down his tag number			1
opinion : did @entity4 shooter make his case on the stand ? ' @entity138 ' @entity18 has testified he described the music to his fiancee as " rap crap			1
" in the parking lot , as the music blared , " his blood started to boil ; he did n't like the music that was coming out of the car next to him ; he got angrier and angrier , " @entity107 said			0
@entity18 rolled down his window and asked the youths to turn it down , which they did , but then turned it back up , @entity107 said			1
" he got angry at the fact that a 17 - year - old kid decided not to listen to him , " she said , adding that @entity18 then pulled a 9 mm gun out of his glove box and shot " systematically and methodically " at the suv			1
" nobody denied that @entity29 was talking back			0
but this defendant took it upon himself to silence @entity29 forever			0
" @entity18 testified tuesday that he saw @entity29 reach down and pick something up , and that he saw about " 4 inches of a barrel " from a 12 - or 20 - gauge shotgun above the window			1
opinion : @entity4 shooter saw black , thought ' threat ' ' you 're not going to kill me ' he muttered aloud to himself , " ' you 're not going to kill me , you son of a bitch , ' " as he opened the glove compartment , grabbed his pistol , dropped the holster at his feet , chambered a round and began firing , he said			0
nine of the 10 rounds hit the car , and three of them struck @entity29 , one of them cutting through his liver , his lung and his aorta			0
@entity107 rejected @entity18 's assertion he had been trying to de-escalate the situation and he feared for his life			1
@entity72 , the defense attorney , noted that no witnesses had accused @entity18 of using any hate words and testified that his client had just come from a wedding , where his ex-wife said he had appeared to be in a good mood			1
@entity72 noted that the @entity154 departed the gas station after the shooting and was gone for three minutes before it returned , enough time for the youths to have dumped a gun			0
detectives did not search the area for days after the shooting , he said			0
@entity72 cited testimony from another passenger in the car with @entity29 who acknowledged he may not have heard all the conversation between the two men			0
' you have reasonable doubt ' witnesses testified that child locks on the @entity154 were engaged , and that @entity29 -- who was seated in the rear -- could not have gotten out of the back seat to threaten @entity18			2
but @entity72 said the teen could simply have opened the door by putting his hand out the window , which was open			0
" you have lack of evidence , conflicts of evidence and reasonable doubt , " he told the jurors			0
on rebuttal , assistant state attorney @entity226 appealed to the jurors ' " common sense			0
" " that defendant did n't shoot into a car full of kids to save his life , " he said			2
" he shot into it to preserve his pride			0
that 's why we 're here			0
" though @entity29 may have had a big mouth , he had no weapon , @entity226 said			0
though he acknowledged minor inconsistencies in witness accounts , he said that was to be expected			0
" it 's not like television , " he said			0
" in real life , there are inconsistencies			0
" the court has decided not to release the identifications of the jurors , fearing they could be the subject of threats , but a document obtained by @entity0 affiliate @entity254 in @entity23 showed the makeup of the jury			1
it has four white females , two black females , four white males , an @entity261 female and a @entity263 male , plus four alternates			1
@entity0 's @entity265 and @entity266 contributed to this report .			2
