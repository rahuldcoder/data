@entity0 -- the @entity2 defended the @entity3 and its director tuesday amid an embarrassing investigation into whether several agents brought prostitutes back to their hotel in @entity9 ahead of a presidential visit			1
@entity12 members have been implicated in the investigation , which began thursday after one of the women complained that she had n't been paid			1
in addition , as many as 10 @entity18 military personnel from all branches of the armed forces are being questioned about potential involvement in any misconduct , two military officials told @entity1			2
the @entity18 were in @entity24 to prepare for president @entity26 's weekend visit to the @entity27 , and @entity26 has said he expects a " rigorous " investigation			1
the investigation is being led by @entity3 director @entity30 , who has been briefing members of @entity32			2
a leading senator said tuesday she had been told as many as 21 women had been involved , and questioned whether the incident could have endangered the president			2
" who were these women ? could they have been members of groups hostile to the @entity18 ? could they have planted bugs , disabled weapons , or in any other ( ways ) jeopardized security of the president or our country ? " asked @entity41 's @entity40 , the ranking @entity42 on the @entity43			1
at the @entity2 , presidential spokesman @entity52 said @entity26 " has confidence " in @entity30 , who he said " acted quickly in response to this incident , " and in the agents around him			1
" the work the @entity3 does , the men and women who protect him and his family and those who work with him , is exemplary as a rule , " @entity52 said			1
" they put their lives on the line , and it is a very difficult job , and he acknowledges that and he appreciates it			0
" @entity68 said she believed @entity30 " will fully investigate " the allegations and take " appropriate action " if the allegations bear out			0
but she questioned whether there was any similar misconduct on previous missions , and whether the issue is a sign of a deeper problem within the agency			0
the @entity3 agents and officers involved range in experience from relative newcomers to nearly 20 - year veterans , and all have been interviewed at least once , two government officials with knowledge of the investigation told @entity1 on monday			2
their security clearances have been pulled while the investigation is under way and could be reinstated if they are cleared , the officials said			0

some of the agents and military personnel maintain they did n't know the women were prostitutes , the official told @entity1			1
" even if they were n't ( prostitutes ) , it was totally wrong to take a foreign national back to a hotel when the president is about to arrive , " rep. @entity101 , @entity103 - @entity102 and the chairman of the @entity105 , told @entity1 's " @entity112			1
" @entity114 chairman rep. @entity113 , @entity115 , said he thinks the agents should take the polygraph tests , if they have n't already done so			0

" @entity113 said his level of confidence in @entity30 is " high			0
" the @entity105 's chairman , @entity128 independent @entity127 , said his staff is looking into the accusations and he may call hearings on the matter			2
" history , unfortunately , is full of cases where people in positions of great responsibility , including security , have been compromised by , well , enemies or spies , " @entity127 said			0
" i 'm not saying that happened here , but once you conduct yourself in this way , you open that risk			0
" @entity115 @entity146 sen. @entity146 , who leads the chamber 's intelligence committee , said she was " profoundly disappointed " by the allegations			2
" i 've always respected the @entity3 as kind of numero uno of our law enforcement community , " she said			0
@entity18 government sources have said there was a dispute between at least one @entity3 member and a woman demanding payment			1
at least one of the women brought to the hotel talked with police , and complaints were filed with the @entity18 embassy , the sources said			1
while soliciting prostitution is legal in certain areas of @entity9 , it is considered a breach of the agency 's conduct code , the government sources said			1
military law also bars service members from patronizing prostitutes , displaying conduct unbecoming an officer or , for enlisted personnel , conduct " prejudicial to good order and discipline			0
" the military personnel involved were sent to @entity9 to support the @entity3			1
a military official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the ongoing investigation told @entity1 that two of those being questioned are @entity185 who handle military working dogs			0
@entity190 and @entity191 personnel , some of whom are believed to be explosive disposal experts , also are being questioned , the official said			0
the alleged misconduct occurred before @entity26 arrived in @entity24 , and the @entity3 said the personnel involved were relieved of duty and sent home before the president landed			1
but the news broke while he was there -- and gen. @entity202 , chairman of the @entity203 , told reporters at the @entity205 on monday that the incident distracted attention " from what was a very important regional engagement for our president			0
" " so we let the boss down , because nobody 's talking about what went on in @entity9 other than this incident , " @entity202 said			1
@entity217 chairman @entity216 , @entity218 , said he would consider holding hearings on the conduct of the members of the military involved in the scandal , but wants to learn more first			0
the committee 's top @entity42 , @entity226 sen. @entity225 , said he is sure " the guilty will be punished , " but lamented that a few members of the military and @entity3 " have tarnished the reputations of many			2
" @entity1 's @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 contributed to this report .			0
