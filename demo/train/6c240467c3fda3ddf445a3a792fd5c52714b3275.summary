the @entity1 man suspected in the 2005 disappearance of @entity3 has sued the @entity5 government for more than $ 13 million , alleging his human rights were violated when @entity5 extradited him last year to @entity7 to face charges in the death of a @entity7 woman			1
" the lawsuit is against the @entity5 government , for having violated @entity14 's basic human rights , " his @entity7 lawyer @entity11 told in session			1
the suit was filed september 4 with the @entity16 in @entity17			0
" maybe they wo n't accept my analysis in @entity7 , because they feel this is the way things have always been done , " said @entity11 , who is based in @entity18			2
" but i believe there are universal human rights and we have to respect those rights			0
we ca n't say that because someone is accused of killing a person , you can violate all their rights			0
" @entity11 said van der @entity14 's former attorney , @entity33 , contacted him in july 2010 about the complaint , and the two men met the following month to begin researching grounds for the lawsuit on the basis of their claim that van der @entity14 's human rights had been violated in june 2010 , when @entity5 expelled him to @entity7			1
@entity11 said he expects to complete next week a similar document , to be filed against the government of @entity7			0
@entity14 , 24 , faces a trial on murder and robbery charges that is set to begin january 6 in @entity7			1
he is accused of killing 21 - year - old @entity46 in his @entity48 hotel room last year			1
police say he took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to @entity5 , where he was arrested a few days later			0
the 13 - page lawsuit says an international arrest warrant had not been filed against @entity14 , but he was arrested by @entity5 authorities anyway			2
but documents from @entity7 's @entity58 indicate that the @entity7 police had requested his arrest ; @entity62 authorities in @entity5 and @entity7 were contacted , as was @entity5 's @entity58			2
the lawsuit further alleges that van der @entity14 was not given enough time to appeal his expulsion from @entity5 , and that that failure was a violation of his basic human rights			1
but correspondence between @entity5 's @entity58 and @entity7 's @entity58 indicates that officials from both ministries considered that van der @entity14 's expulsion was legal under the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) treaty , which allows for international cooperation in matters of criminal activity			1
the documents were obtained by @entity79 on @entity79 , which is a sister network to @entity81			0
the resolution to expel @entity14 from @entity5 , which was approved by the @entity5 government , cites a police report as having been filed on may 13 , 2010			0
@entity14 's lawyer points out that his client did not even enter @entity5 until may 31			1
the lawsuit refers to the apparent typo as evidence that @entity5 and @entity7 officials were violating the @entity1 man 's rights			1
the lawsuit adds that @entity5 police did not give van der @entity14 the opportunity to call or use a computer to contact relatives , did not give him legal representation and did not give him a translator -- all putative violations of his rights			1
@entity62 documents obtained by @entity79 indicate that van der @entity14 voluntarily gave a statement in @entity104 to @entity5 police in which he said that he and @entity46 had been attacked in @entity48 and that he fled fearing for his life			0
@entity14 was once the prime suspect in the disappearance of @entity107 , the @entity108 teenager who vanished in may 2005 while on a graduation trip to the @entity111 island of @entity112			2
he was arrested twice but never charged in connection with @entity107 's disappearance , which remains unsolved			0
he also faces extradition charges to the @entity115			0
in june 2010 , a federal grand jury in @entity108 indicted van der @entity14 on charges of wire fraud and extortion after allegations surfaced that he tried to extort $ 250,000 from @entity107 's mother			2
he was given $ 25,000 , and authorities believe he used that money to travel to @entity7 and participate in a poker tournament , where he met @entity46 .			0
