-- where do lonely hearts go ? @entity0 : who is @entity4 ? a @entity5 on the @entity6 @entity7 singer @entity4 , 21 , has written a dissertation on the question with his debut lp			0
@entity4 -- a gifted blue - eyed - soulster with @entity13 's flexible falsetto and @entity15 's ear for throwback grooves -- got noticed last year for his vocals on house duo disclosure 's slow jam " @entity20			1
" @entity0 : @entity4 comes out , says debut is dedicated to unrequited love with in the @entity27 's orchestral flourishes and focus on a single unrealized affair , it seems the baby - faced singer is being positioned as a male @entity31			1
but while the album flirts with a few radiant moments , @entity4 's endless yearning is n't wrapped in as many irresistible packages			1
@entity0 : @entity4 dazzles in ' snl ' debut he rolls deepest on the gospel - powered " @entity37 " -- a spare track with a simple arrangement that matches its bare plea -- and " like i can , " a blissful groove that packs a @entity44 rock - radio punch			1
elsewhere , though he reaches for his upper register with the same eagerness that he grasps for love , his emo hopelessness is a flood drowning everything in sight			0
the album 's team of producers gives @entity4 a mostly blank canvas to showcase his vocals , providing room for soaring riffs over fingerpicked guitars on " not in @entity60 " and " @entity61			2
" but neither leaves as indelible a mark as @entity4 's lost love has left on his heart			2
