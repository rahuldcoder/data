-- the nine young @entity1 thought they were near the end of their long and dangerous journey toward freedom			1
their years - long odyssey had taken them thousands of miles , from @entity1 , one of the world 's most repressive states , to @entity12 , a small , landlocked nation in @entity13			1
from there , they just needed to cross the border into @entity17 and find their way to @entity21 diplomats who would be able to offer them citizenship and a new life			0
orphaned and homeless : surviving the streets of @entity1 but something went wrong in @entity12			1
they were detained by the authorities			0
and rather than transferring the group of young refugees to @entity21 officials , as the people engineering their escape were anticipating , the @entity12 government this week did something unexpected			1
it gave them back to @entity1			1
" this is a horrible , horrible thing that has happened , " said @entity37 , the president of the @entity38 , a @entity39 - based nonprofit group that was involved in the effort to get the young @entity1 to safety			1
analysis : @entity1 diplomacy effort grows , but sides are still far apart the @entity48 ' refugee agency , @entity47 , says @entity12 deported the group of @entity1 to @entity50 on monday			1
and @entity37 said friday that she believes they have already been flown back to @entity1 , where she fears they could face torture or even death			1
human rights advocates and @entity47 have criticized the decision by @entity12 to deport the refugees , who are between 15 and 23 years old , noting that international law gives people the right not to be forced to return to places where they face persecution			1
thousands of @entity1 have fled their country 's @entity66 regime since the @entity68 in the 1950s and settled in @entity21 , which offers them citizenship			2
most of them make their way there through @entity50 and @entity13			0
plucked from the streets until they were detained by @entity12 authorities earlier this month , it appears the group of young @entity1 traced a path similar to that of many other refugees			1
years ago , they slipped through the authoritarian grip of their homeland and crossed the border into @entity50 , most likely with their various parents			0
opinion : what @entity1 could learn from @entity92 @entity37 said that in @entity50 , one or way another , they all ended up fending for themselves on the streets , eating out of trash bins and dodging @entity1 agents			2
she said she did n't know whether their parents had abandoned them , died or been detained and sent back to @entity1			1
they were plucked from that precarious existence by a @entity21 man and his wife who were living in @entity50 , @entity37 said , referring to the man only by the name of " @entity107 " to protect his identity			0

to avoid getting caught , the youngsters had to remain inside at all times			0
" you could liken it to a @entity120 family trying to hide from the @entity121 , " @entity37 said			0
" they had to be invisible			0
" @entity50 does n't treat @entity1 in its territory as refugees and usually sends them back across the border			1
difficult journeys in 2011 , the @entity38 began working with @entity107 and his wife to try get the group of @entity1 out of @entity50 to @entity21 or the @entity39			1
they managed to get the three oldest @entity1 to safety in @entity21 via @entity17 , @entity37 said			2
next , they succeeded in organizing the escape of the two youngest children and one with learning difficulties to the @entity39			2
analysis : what 's @entity135 up to ? nine others remained in @entity50			0
@entity107 and his wife accompanied them on the quest to reach @entity21 via @entity12 and @entity17			2
they reportedly entered @entity12 around may 10 and were detained soon after that			1
at the time , @entity12 authorities assured @entity107 and his wife , who were not being held , that there was nothing to worry about , @entity37 said			2
" we had no reason to believe that the @entity12 were going to cut some deal with @entity1 , " she said , noting that she had helped to get four other @entity1 to the @entity39 from @entity12 in 2009			1
but on monday , she said , @entity107 received word that the group of refugees was being taken to the @entity149			2
by then , it was too late to save them			0
" when i got the call , i was in shock , " @entity37 said			0
an ' alarming case ' other organizations also were surprised by the development			0
@entity12 has been one of the main routes to a safe country for @entity1 defectors , according to @entity161 , a senior program officer with the @entity162 for @entity163 , a nongovernmental organization based in @entity164			1
" we never officially experienced the @entity12 government actually cooperating with the @entity1 government and sending them back to @entity1 , " she said			1
" this is a very surprising , alarming case , especially the fact that the @entity1 government got involved			0

@entity12 government officials in the country 's capital , @entity180 , declined to provide official comment on the matter when contacted by @entity0 on friday			2
but @entity183 , an official at the @entity184 in @entity164 , said that the refugees had been handed over to @entity1 because they did n't have visas and were therefore in @entity12 illegally			1
" we know they are @entity1 , that 's why they were sent back to the @entity149 , " he said			2
" that 's the rule			0
" he said he did n't know where the refugees are now			0
controversy in @entity21 @entity21 officials have been criticized in their country 's news media as having failed to act quickly and decisively enough to get the @entity1 out of @entity12 after their detention			1
but @entity37 said that all those involved in the attempt to recover the refugees had " underestimated " the @entity1 ' determination to get hold of them			2
she noted the efforts of @entity21 in previous successful operations to rescue @entity1			0
" we have n't seen this before , " she said			0

concerns over safety international organizations , meanwhile , are raising concerns about what fate awaits the deported refugees			0
" @entity1 has to come clean on where these nine refugees are and publicly guarantee that they will not be harmed or retaliated against for having fled the country , " said @entity227 , deputy @entity13 director of the advocacy group @entity229			1
" as a result of their return they are at dire risk -- @entity1 criminalizes unauthorized departures and is known to torture those caught trying to escape and those sent back			1
" @entity48 high commissioner for refugees @entity241 expressed deep concern " about the safety and fundamental human rights of these individuals if they are returned " to @entity1			2
@entity107 and his wife , herself a former @entity1 refugee , are now back in @entity21 and remain very upset about what happened , @entity37 says			2
