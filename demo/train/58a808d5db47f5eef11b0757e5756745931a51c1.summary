locked inside the gemstone there appears to be a human face			1
as the jewel is turned it fragments , appearing to be looking in several different directions at once			2
how the disembodied head , which seems to have a life of its own , was spirited into the gem seems to be something of a mystery			2
" it is a sacred thing to create a face , " says @entity13 , 58 , the @entity15 artisan jeweler that produced the piece			1
" it 's like a ghost appearing in the gem as you work			1
the dialogue of gemstone , color and light gives it life			2
" there is a @entity30 saying that every person has many selves , and that inspired me spiritually as i created this work			2
" the work , now and always , is a depiction of @entity37 , the @entity38 goddess of the seasons			2
her dancing was said to move the year from through winter to fall , spring and summer			2
such a multifaceted figure from mythology seemed the perfect inspiration for the jeweler			2
@entity13 's exceptional artistry has caught the eye of a number of high - profile buyers , including @entity50 , chairman of @entity52 's in @entity53 , and prince @entity54			1
carving out his own identity it 's not the first time that @entity13 has " created " a human face in a jewel			1
but now and @entity60 is certainly the finest demonstration of the " @entity13 cut " , a technique that @entity13 invented and perfected over decades			1
rather than cutting into the surface of the jewel , shaping it into a geometric form , @entity13 cuts into it from the back , carving out complex images from inside the gem			1
" every stroke and cut has to consider movement of the light , " he says			2
" it took a lot of practice because i had to learn how to carve in reverse			0
" when you work from the back of the jewel , right is left , top is bottom and deep becomes shallow			0
it is like having to drive a car backwards and forwards at the same time			0
" @entity13 uses a dentist 's drill with a specially adapted blade , which rotates 36,000 times a minute			1
when he started using the tool , he quickly realized that the heat generated would damage the gemstone -- a major problem with material that is this expensive			0
so he developed a technique of working under cold water			1
" it means i ca n't see clearly when i 'm cutting , " he says			0
" it becomes a very repetitive process			0
i make one cut , take it out of the water to check it , dry the stone , check it again , and if it 's fine i put it back in the water and make another cut			1
" this is a painstaking process , but for @entity13 it is also a meditative one			1
he puts his " soul and consciousness into the creation " , he says , and becomes so absorbed that he " forgets [ his ] own existence "			0
" my mind is one with the work , and my physical self is removed from the gemstone , " he explains			0
" it 's quite emotional , because i 'm within in the inner world of gemstone , focused on how the light enters and interacts with the colors			1
" from rags to riches @entity13 's technique is the culmination of many years of development			1
he was born in a poor part of @entity126 in 1958 , and left school at the age of 13			1
in order to support his family , he became an apprentice to a sculptor making @entity15 religious iconography			1
he went on to study @entity135 sculpture , and in 1974 set up his own workshop			0
after being commissioned by a @entity139 art collector to make a jeweled " stupa " , or @entity30 reliquary , @entity13 's focus shifted from sculpture to jewelery and he began to explore innovative techniques			1
he began setting jewels in titanium instead of gold , which allowed him to create " jewelery sculptures " that were still light enough to wear			0
he also experimented with using gems to fix each other in place , rather than metal settings , as well as new methods of cutting jade			0
but his dream was to find an entirely new way of working with gemstones			0
gradually , he refined his ideas until he arrived at the concept of reverse cutting			0
in the @entity161 he began to practice , using cheap crystals			0
but after a year - and - a - half , he realized that the tools he had been using were not equal to the task			0
so he visited factories that produced medical instruments , and after six months of research , came up with the idea of modifying a dentist 's drill			2
" it was the only way to satisfy the standard i wanted to achieve , " he says			0
the height of exclusivity @entity13 was the first @entity53 artist to exhibit his work at the prestigious @entity178 in @entity179			1
in 2012 , he showed " @entity180 " , a necklace made of diamond maple leaves with a central jade stone			0
it sold for $ 73.5 million			1
this year , he showed " @entity185 " , a brooch featuring a deep pink , 64 - carat @entity188 tourmaline surrounded by rubies and colored diamonds			0
these pieces of jewelry carry such an aura of exclusivity that it is rare to find a @entity13 piece on the open market			1
most of his work is sold directly to collectors , who are loath to sell them on			2
when they are put up for sale , they carry hefty price tags			0
two years ago , a small pair of @entity13 earrings sold in @entity204 for $ 555,000			1
" each piece can take me thousands of hours , " he says			0
" it is like going on a journey each time			0
" the future underground : @entity211 's new spaceship - style tube trains did artists eerily predict the @entity214 crisis ? would you eat @entity217 soup ? the lost art of the @entity220 pin - up			2

@entity15 jewelry *designer* @entity13 places human faces inside precious stones

@entity13 's pieces have sold for as much as $ 73.5 million
