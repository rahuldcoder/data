-- in an attack orchestrated by a @entity4 @entity3 commander , around 250 prisoners , most of them militants , were freed this week at the central prison in @entity8 in northwestern @entity4			1
the commander , @entity9 , had been freed a year earlier , this time at the central jail in @entity11 , where 150 @entity3 fighters stormed the facility and released nearly 400 prisoners -- @entity4 's largest jailbreak			1
both prison breaks happened in the stronghold of the @entity4 @entity3 , @entity19 province , which borders @entity20 , and both were conducted with a high degree of sophistication			1
this week 's attack unfolded in multiple stages , beginning with cutting the prison 's electricity , detonating bombs that had been planted around the facility to breach its external wall , and ambushing the security forces that rushed to the scene			2
once the militants overwhelmed the guards , they used loudspeakers to contact and locate specific prisoners , freeing them from their cells with hand grenades			2
at least 13 people died in the attack			0
@entity4 authorities launched a search operation for the missing prisoners , but few have been recaptured			2
the others have simply melted away into the mountains			0
jihadist militants have been breaking people out of prison across the @entity52 and @entity53 for years , some with significant consequences for the @entity56 and its allies			1
militant group claims responsibility for @entity61 prison attacks a 2006 prison break in the @entity64 capital , @entity65 , led to the creation of @entity67 , one of @entity67 's most virulent affiliates , the one that recruited the " underwear bomber " who nearly brought down @entity74 over @entity75 on christmas day 2009			2
during the 2006 prison break , 23 inmates escaped through a 460 - foot tunnel into a nearby mosque			2
two of the escapees went on to become the leader and deputy leader of @entity67			0
in 2008 and again in 2011 , the @entity84 @entity3 led attacks on the @entity86 in @entity87 in southern @entity84 that freed an astounding number of militants , around 1,700			1
like the prison attacks by the @entity3 in @entity4 , the @entity87 plots showed sophisticated planning			1
in the aftermath of the 2011 breach , @entity84 officials discovered an intricate network of tunnels under the jail , equipped with electrical and ventilation systems			0
but perhaps no group has made prison breaks an organizational focus more than @entity67 in @entity61			0
on july 21 , 2012 , @entity103 , @entity67 in @entity61 's leader , announced the " breaking the @entity109 " campaign , a yearlong effort to release his group 's prisoners			0
according to a count by the @entity113 , since @entity111 's announcement , @entity67 in @entity61 has conducted assaults on seven major prisons			0
earlier this month , hundreds of prisoners , including senior members of @entity67 , escaped from @entity61 's @entity119 jail on the outskirts of @entity121 following a military - style assault on the prison			0
@entity125 's @entity61 affiliate claimed responsibility for that attack			0
elsewhere in the @entity52 , a prison riot and an attack launched from outside @entity123 in @entity130 , @entity131 , freed more than 1,000 inmates saturday			1
although it does n't appear that groups such as the @entity3 and @entity67 are coordinating strategies in freeing their fellow militants , it is likely that they are inspiring each other with every successful , and well - publicized , prison break			1
the attacks are generally well - organized and often free significant numbers of inmates , refreshing the militant groups ' ranks , and each successful prison break is a propaganda coup			1
insiders assist in varying degrees in these different prison breaks , but the militants are also exploiting the countries ' inadequate correctional systems			0
many of these prison facilities where convicts have escaped en masse were meant to house criminals , not terrorists , and they often lack the fortification needed to fend off armed assaults			0
1,200 inmates break out of @entity130 prison security concerns regarding prison facilities are part of the reason that 86 @entity167 detainees who were cleared for transfer into the custody of their home countries three years ago still remain in jail at @entity167			1
fifty - six of those men are from @entity64 , which has a notoriously porous prison system			0
the recent prison breaks in @entity4 , @entity61 and @entity131 are reminders that the @entity56 needs to do more to strengthen high security prisons in countries such as @entity64 if there is any hope that prisoners who are cleared for transfer -- but have been languishing at @entity167 for many years -- are ever to return home .			1
