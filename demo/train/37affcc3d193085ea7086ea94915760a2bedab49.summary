the @entity1 government says it is investigating allegations that unauthorized @entity4 gold miners killed dozens of @entity5 in an attack in the @entity1 @entity7			1
the announcement wednesday followed calls for action this week by a @entity12 organization and other indigenous groups			2
the @entity1 government said that two public officials had been asked to carry out the inquiry into the alleged attack from a helicopter			1
@entity20 , a @entity21 - based organization that advocates tribal peoples ' rights worldwide , published online what it said was a declaration from a group of organizations representing indigenous peoples and communities in the @entity7 about the alleged attack			1
the indigenous organization 's declaration said that the number of people killed had yet to be fully established , but that of about 80 @entity5 people who lived in the community , only three survivors had been found			1
the alleged attack on the community of @entity40 in the @entity1 municipality of @entity42 , near the @entity4 border , is believed to have taken place in july			1
@entity20 said in its own report that information is only just beginning to emerge because of the remote location of the community			0
the @entity12 , who live in @entity1 and @entity4 , are considered the largest indigenous group in the @entity50 that remains largely untouched by advances in the outside world			1
anthropologists have described the tribe in a variety of ways , ranging from fierce warmongers to mystics to introspective intellectuals			0
in recent years , the tribe has been under increasing pressure as miners illegally entered their land in the search of profits			0
miners in @entity4 have transmitted diseases such as malaria and flu to the @entity5 , who have little resistance to such diseases , observers say			2
the site where the attack is alleged to have happened is a five - hour helicopter ride , or 15 days on foot , from @entity80 , the main @entity1 city in the @entity7 , the government said			1
the harm caused to indigenous peoples and the environment by @entity4 gold miners working in the border area is a long - standing issue			1
the @entity4 police carried out an operation last month targeting miners operating on the @entity4 side of the border			2
in its report on the situation , @entity20 cited @entity5 people who had spoken to @entity95 who said they had seen burned bodies and bones in the area where the attack is alleged to have happened			2
one of the people it quoted , @entity12 , a leader of the @entity5 organization @entity102 , said he had been told that those who survived had been out hunting when the community 's communal house was set on fire			0
" for three years we have been denouncing the situation , " survival quoted him as saying			0
" there are lots of gold miners working illegally in the forest			2
" both survival and the indigenous organizations referred to an attack in 1993 on the @entity5 community of @entity116 in @entity4 in which they said 16 @entity95 were killed			1
several miners were subsequently convicted for their role in the attack , @entity117 said			0
the organizations called for a criminal investigation into the alleged attack in july , and for measures to clamp down on the illegal activities in the area			0
" this is another appalling tragedy for the @entity5 -- heaping crime upon crime , " said @entity127 , director of survival			0
" all @entity7 governments must stop the rampant illegal mining , logging and settlement in indigenous territories			0
" @entity1 's state - run refineries afflicted by mismanagement			0

indigenous groups say only three survivors have been found from a community of about 80
