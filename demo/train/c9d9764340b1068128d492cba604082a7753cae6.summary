as a proud @entity3 @entity2 , i am grateful that an @entity5 prime minister has been invited to address @entity6 for a third time -- a high honor shared only by sir @entity9			1
yet in the middle of an @entity5 election and with a congressional battle over @entity15 sanctions looming , sometimes an invitation is more political gamesmanship than diplomatic honor			1
@entity5 prime minister @entity18 and @entity21 speaker @entity20 's latest gambit -- arranging an address to a joint session of @entity6 by the prime minister just two weeks before the @entity5 election -- is severely taxing our special relationship			1
with mixed emotions , i find myself empathizing with the @entity29 leader who told @entity5 columnist @entity30 : " i was literally sick to my stomach when i heard about it			2
" @entity21 spokesman @entity33 diplomatically called the invitation " a departure from protocol , " and even staunch @entity3 advocate and @entity39 head @entity37 termed it " ill - advised			0
" sadly , this invitation is glaring evidence that @entity5 is becoming a partisan football , a wedge issue cynically manipulated to grab headlines and seek political gain			1
we saw this dynamic play out in the 2012 presidential race when @entity50 's campaign attempted to peel off @entity29 voters from president @entity52 by insinuating that @entity52 had thrown @entity5 " under the bus			2
" it did n't work then , though the tactic will likely rear its ugly head again in the next race for the @entity21			0
and it 's not likely to work now for @entity20 , who is essentially enlisting the @entity5 leader to help him try to deal the @entity60 a political blow by derailing nuclear negotiations with @entity15 through legislating new sanctions			2
unfortunately , although the @entity67 is clearly hoping to hobble the current president 's agenda , the real impact of the speaker 's political stunt is likely to be a further erosion of the bipartisan nature of support for @entity5 , at a time when @entity5 increasingly needs @entity2 's backing as a bulwark against its growing international isolation			1
secretary of state @entity78 held a lengthy meeting with @entity5 's ambassador to the @entity2 on tuesday , a day before the @entity82 visit was announced , a senior administration official told @entity1			1
the @entity5 government was being accused of assassinating an @entity15 general on the @entity5 - @entity86 border , and the @entity21 was , according to eminent @entity5 journalist @entity87 , exerting significant effort in an attempt to de-escalate the situation with @entity15			0
yet in an example of what @entity87 describes as " ingratitude of the ugliest kind , " the planned visit was not mentioned			0
and when @entity18 arrives in march , he and @entity78 will not meet			0
@entity2 and @entity5 who care about the relationship between the two countries must work quickly to prevent relations from sinking any lower			1
while our militaries are still coordinating as closely as ever , and our special relationship is ultimately built on more than the chemistry between two leaders , key long - term interests of both countries hang in the balance			0
erosion of trust between our governments will damage our ability to work together to defeat the @entity112 , prevent a nuclear - armed @entity15 and establish a @entity114 state alongside @entity5 in peace and security			0
@entity20 would be wise to postpone his invitation until later this spring , when the new @entity5 government has been formed and the next prime minister has a fresh mandate from the @entity5 people			2
and whoever that next leader is should make @entity82 his ( or her ) first visit , and work with the president to confront the serious challenges that our two countries face .			0

invitation to @entity130 to speak to @entity6 has caused *controversy*
