the brother of @entity2 leader @entity1 is proposing to mediate a peace deal between the @entity4 and @entity5			1
in an exclusive interview with @entity8 , @entity6 unveiled his proposal for the first time , saying he is in a unique position to help end the violence and that both sides need to make concessions			1
as the @entity2 leader 's brother , he says they are ideologically inseparable , and that if anyone can talk his brother out of violence it 's him			1
he is like so many former prisoners i 've met -- calm , collected , focused and utterly convinced by long held views examined , tested and reforged in incarceration			0
@entity6 is not a physically imposing man			1
his long beard is shading from gray to white , his features and figure drawn			0
@entity32 is long over but he still fasts until the sun goes down			0
@entity6 spent 14 years in @entity35 jail on charges including terrorism and involvement in the 1981 assassination of president @entity40 1981			1
on 9/11 , @entity2 looks to @entity41 to revive its fortunes for five years he was in solitary confinement in a cell 180 centimeters by 180 centimeters ( 6 feet by 6 feet ) where , locked in with his own thoughts , he had plenty of time to plan what to do when released			1
that day came a few months ago in may			0
he wants peace , he says , between @entity51 and @entity52 and has written a proposal that outlines the terms			1
he says he 's offering to be an intermediary between @entity5 and the @entity56 and the @entity4			1
" i do n't represent a certain group			0
my role is a mediator between the @entity4 and them			1
" a source with direct knowledge of @entity35 government talks with jihadists in the @entity65 says @entity6 is helping negotiations			1
the source says @entity6 has the respect of the @entity5 and the trust of the new government			1
@entity1 says his offer puts him at risk from radical @entity5 , but says he is not acting from weakness or for personal gain			1
his six - page proposal offers a 10 - year truce if the following terms are met			0
in brief they are : @entity56 and @entity4 to stop intervening in @entity51 lands @entity56 to stop interfering in @entity51 education @entity56 to end the war on @entity5 @entity56 to release all @entity82 prisoners			1
the document also calls on @entity5 to change their behavior too : stop attacks on @entity87 and @entity56 interests protect legitimate @entity87 and @entity56 interests in @entity51 lands stop provoking the @entity56 and the @entity4 through his steely determination to get his voice heard and his message out it is hard to gauge how much hope @entity6 is really investing in his initiative			1
is he trying to get back in the jihadist spotlight he once occupied before his incarceration ? @entity2 diminished , but not gone back then he was military commander of @entity98 that would later ally with @entity2			1
back then he reportedly had disagreements with his brother about the way forward for the group			2
then came his came his arrest , long before 9/11 , picked up , he says , by @entity35 authorities in the @entity105			2
he says he told his interrogators he could work a truce with @entity5 but he says his jailers did n't want to know			2
" if this idea had succeeded , september 11 would not have even happened in the first place			0
i hope this opportunity today is not wasted			0
" @entity112 had a similar proposal in 2004			0
it was followed a year later by the deadly 7/7 subway attack in @entity116 killing 52 people			0
@entity1 offers no guarantees that he has some quick fix			2
" this is a very tough mission			0
you have to be logical			0
if you want to live in peace then you must make others feel that they will live in peace			2
" he says his brother will listen to him , but admits he has n't talked to him in long over a decade			2
while he once had standing among his @entity82 peers , the reach of his influence today is hard to judge ; being connected by blood to one of the world 's most wanted men only carries so much weight			0
the cost , he says , of getting out of today 's conflict must be paid			0
" we want to turn this page and forget the past			0
" it would n't be the first time the terms are unacceptably high			0
