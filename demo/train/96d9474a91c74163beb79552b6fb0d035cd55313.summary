@entity0 -- following a year in which " people power " was the rallying cry from the @entity5 to the @entity6 , the annual @entity2 might seem an elitist anomaly			2
never mind the 1 % , this is the 0.00004 % : around 2,600 of the world 's top political and business leaders , coming together to address the big issues -- most pressingly , the eurozone debt crisis -- in the luxurious surrounds of a @entity16 ski resort			1
among those gathering in @entity19 's highest - altitude town from january 25 to 29 will be royalty from @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and the @entity24 , billionaires like philanthropist @entity26 , senior executives from @entity28 , @entity29 and other tech giants , and the leaders of countries including @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , and the world 's youngest nation , @entity38			1
while admission is free for heads of state , civil society or faith leaders and international organizations , among others , those paying will face a $ 20,000 price tag for admission , plus other costs which can easily push the bill to $ 40,000			0
but the true barrier to entry is having the power and influence to secure a " white badge " of invitation , the only means of admission to this most exclusive of clubs			0
as undemocratic as the event may seem , the forum 's architects say that the current global atmosphere of unrest will give discussions an even greater significance			1
this year 's theme is " the great transformation : shaping new models			1
" @entity69 , the @entity33 economist who founded the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) in 1971 , says new decision - making models are needed to account for changed global realities			0
the @entity2 has cautioned that the backlash against rising inequality , seen in the discontent behind the @entity6 and the @entity5 , risks derailing globalization and constitutes a threat to economies worldwide			1
amidst the turmoil of the current economic environment , emphasis needs to be placed on finding new models for assessing the quality of economic growth -- ensuring it is both sustainable and inclusive			0
given rising youth unemployment -- in @entity85 , @entity19 's worst affected country , joblessness among young people stands at about 45 % -- a new model for job creation is also needed			1
" for the first time in generations , many people no longer believe that their children will grow up to enjoy a higher standard of living than theirs , " said @entity91 , the @entity2 managing director behind the @entity2 's @entity92 2012 report			0
the key to avoiding catastrophe , @entity99 argues in a discussion paper , is " to provide young people with the capability to create their own jobs : to move from the pure concept of unemployment to the concept of micro-entrepreneurship			0
" those who dismiss the forum as an ineffectual talk-fest for the wealthy and privileged may point to the thematic similarities with previous years ' forums as evidence that the event does little to actually implement change towards its stated ends			1
it 's certainly true that the problems that have given a more austere tone to proceedings in recent years have only endured , or worsened , since the world 's elite last visited @entity125			1
at least this year 's discussions will not want for a sense of urgency			1
delegates will meet against the backdrop of the eurozone debt crisis , with @entity19 nations bickering over the fiscal compact they hope will be their salvation			1
but ahead of the @entity137 summit which immediately follows @entity125 on january 30 , the situation remains bleak			2
@entity138 and @entity139 recently lost their prized @entity141 credit ratings in a downgrade by @entity143 which affected seven other eurozone nations			0
budget deficit numbers for @entity146 , the country which triggered the current crisis , are getting worse , while crucial talks between the country 's government and its creditors on debt haircuts have struck difficulties			2
the world 's largest economy suffered the same indignity as @entity138 when , in an unprecedented move , the @entity157 stripped of @entity141 status in august			1
this followed of months of uncertainty stemming from the political paralysis over raising the $ 14.3 trillion debt ceiling , the resolution of which meant the country narrowly avoided a potentially calamitous default			0
and , a year on from its outbreak , the failure of the @entity5 to deliver dividends has some questioning whether it really constitutes a new dawn			0
in @entity175 , unemployment is at a decade - long high , tourism is down by a quarter , the @entity173 was 2011 's worst performer and the once celebrated military has been recast as a villain			0
the success of @entity182 parties on the new political landscape of the @entity184 has disappointed some secularists and liberals , and raised concerns about the social changes that could ensue			0
for those in attendance , @entity125 will provide an opportunity not just to air opinions , but perhaps also to build a consensus on how to approach these new realities			2
the real action will be conducted behind the scenes , at exclusive cocktail parties and black - tie events in the town 's most expensive hotels			0
eventually though , from the muted hum of discussions , a better sense of the global agenda for the year ahead will emerge , even for those of us without white badges .			2

the world 's elite will converge on @entity125 with the eurozone crisis at the forefront of discussions
the theme of this year 's event is " the great transformation : shaping new models "
forum organizers say the backlash against rising inequality is *jeopardizing* globalization
*critics* say the event does little to actually implement change towards its stated ends
