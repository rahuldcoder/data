-- @entity1 was too busy bringing sexy back to go to college — which , on the whole , seems to have worked out just fine for him			2
unfortunately , it also means that when @entity1 decided to call his next single " @entity12 , " he apparently had no idea that the name was already trademarked by a sexual assault awareness foundation that 's been holding emotionally - charged campus events since the ' 70s			1
luckily , the @entity13 was there to inform @entity1 of his folly — leading the singer to release the following statement to @entity18 : @entity0 : hear @entity1 's new single ' @entity19 ' here " upon the release of my new single ' @entity19 , ' i was made aware of an organization of the same name called @entity24			2
i wanted to take this opportunity to let all know that neither my song nor its lyrics have any association with the organization			0
as i 've learned more about @entity24 , i 'm moved by its efforts to stop violence against women , create safe communities and encourage respectful relationships for women — something we all should rally around			0
it is my hope that this coincidence will bring more awareness to this cause			0
" @entity1 's words have n't exactly mollified @entity19 's leadership , which was understandably upset once it heard about his song ( not to mention lyrics such as " @entity48 , use me up until there 's nothing left " )			1
@entity0 : @entity1 's racy video for ' @entity52 ' will not be moved " it just shows how far we have to go when @entity12 as a historic movement to end sexual violence in all forms is still not widely enough known , according to mr. @entity1 , that he claims he did n't know that we existed , " @entity54 executive director @entity53 told @entity55 yesterday			1
@entity53 's organization sent a letter to @entity1 threatening legal action over using its name without permission ; its volunteer lawyer is apparently still awaiting a response from @entity1 's team			1
