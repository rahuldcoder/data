@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 family spent the last few days packing up their belongings , moving out furniture , helping relatives and praying for a miracle in the face of the rising , menacing waters of the @entity13 and @entity14 rivers			1
by sunday , they had a few things they still had to do : clear out their trailer home in the @entity20 subdivision of @entity0 , @entity1 , in order to head to higher ground ahead of the 5 p.m. mandatory evacuation deadline , and find a way to celebrate their daughter @entity25 's fourth birthday			1
@entity1 residents rush to get out of flood 's path so , after all the frantic last - minute preparations were complete , @entity4 finally made it to a nearby grocery store to get a cake			1
it was in hopes of giving @entity25 a little bit of sunshine during what her father has described as a terrifying experience			0
" she ca n't swim , and she hears all the stories about the water rising , " @entity4 said			2
" she is scared she wo n't be able to make it out			2
" the @entity46 are n't alone			2
they are among 750 people in low - lying areas around @entity0 who were ordered to leave after the @entity50 authorized the opening of floodgates on the @entity53			1
the aim is to minimize greater devastation further downriver , in cities like @entity57 and @entity58			0
but the consequence is that as many as 4,000 people , according to @entity1 gov. @entity60 , could have their homes submerged as waters are funneled into the @entity64 , between that river and the @entity13			1
that includes the town of @entity0 , about 20 miles southwest of @entity53			1
this area is the first with a significant population seeing the rising water after this past weekend 's opening of four floodgates at the @entity53			2
@entity74 explained @entity4 said sunday that he , his wife and their three children moved into the subdivision two months ago			2
now , they are frantically preparing to move out -- heading to @entity4 's sister 's house until the floodwaters recede			2
" we just moved in here , and now we 're in the process of moving everything out , " said @entity4 , 23			1
" i have no choice			0
if not , i 'm going to lose everything			0
" handling the logistics of a last - minute move is one thing			0
but as challenging is explaining what 's happening , and why , to a young child			0
@entity4 said his daughter @entity25 has " heard the stories of the snakes and the alligators and everything else that 's liable to come up the river			0
" " she does n't really understand , " her father said			0
@entity101 , a @entity0 native , is also trying to come to grips with the @entity50 ' decision that has turned his life upside down			1
stars talk about flooding and the response by day , he 's an inspector at an oil refinery , checking pipes and welding			0
but now he has put that and everything else on hold , as he hitched up his trailer home to his truck in order to head to higher ground			0
asked about the approaching waters , the first words that sprang to @entity101 's mind were " crazy " and " unreal			1
" " it 's a lot of water that 's going to be coming around here , " the 24 - year - old said			0
his great - grandmother was in @entity0 for the great flood of 1927 , which inundated 165 million acres , killed 246 people and left another 600,000 homeless throughout the @entity13 system , according to a @entity130 report			1
that flood , ironically , spurred the creation of the @entity50 , empowering them to create systems to guard against further calamities -- and giving them the authority to let waters flow from some levees to wash away some areas in order to spare others			0
this , of course , is what 's happening with @entity0 , @entity145 and other communities nearby			1
@entity101 recalls his grandfather , too , telling him about the historic 1937 flood			1
the family stuck around the southeastern @entity1 community , but he 's not sure what will happen when the floodwaters finally subside this time around			1
" i do n't know who 's going to come back , who 's going to stay gone , " he said			2
" it wo n't be the same			0
i 'd like to come back , but we 'll have to wait and see what happens			0

*hundreds* in @entity1 's @entity64 basin have been ordered to evacuate
" we just moved in here and now we 're in the process of moving everything out "
@entity0 native @entity101 is n't sure if he or others will return afterward
