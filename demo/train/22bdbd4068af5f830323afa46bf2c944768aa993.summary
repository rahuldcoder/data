editor 's note : as @entity4 's neighboring countries are struggling to accommodate an influx of refugees , no place is less prepared to cope than @entity7			1
@entity9 ceo @entity8 recently returned from a visit to the refugee camps in @entity7 where she saw the conditions firsthand			1
( @entity9 ) -- tiny baby @entity13 sat sleeping peacefully in her car seat , unaware of the hubbub around her			1
her beautiful 2 - month - old face was the picture of calm			0
we sat on an old mattress in the heat and spoke with her parents , who had left @entity4 just one month before			1
they fled the violence and instability in the province of @entity27 in northern @entity4 to come to this teeming , garbage strewn spot near the northern @entity7 mountains			1
her young father spoke of the day they decided to leave @entity4 , when the fighting got to be too much			1
the family of four -- mother , father , 2 - year - old @entity38 and 1 - month - old @entity13 -- left with nothing but what they could carry on the walk to @entity44 camp			1
@entity13 and her family may be some of the lucky ones to get to the relative safety of this northern region of @entity7			2
the border at the crossing they came through was closed during our visit , with thousands of @entity4 refugees , many of them @entity55 , now waiting along the border			1
they are escaping the fighting that has torn @entity4 apart and scattered its people			2
the border points for refugees trying to leave @entity4 can close unpredictably -- just one more piece of uncertainty for a people brutalized by a war that has killed at least 70,000 and driven more than 1.7 million from @entity4 to @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and here in @entity7			1
these refugees may be the most forgotten of this war , with the majority of the attention and funding for relief going to the large populations now living in @entity67 and @entity66			0
but @entity7 now has more than 161,000 refugees -- most of them in northern @entity7 -- and by @entity78 estimates that figure could reach a staggering 350,000 by the end of this year			1
the @entity81 , which leads three northern provinces of @entity7 , has stepped up to try to help those flowing across the @entity4 border , providing basic housing and services like meals and water			1
but the flow is becoming too much , with a camp developed last april for 10,000 now swelling to more than 50,00 , with absolutely no capacity to receive any more of those expected to surge in again once the border reopens			0
the conditions in the camp are tough			2
more than 50,000 people are packed in a dense area outside the city of @entity99 with no sewer systems , insufficient everything , and the threat of screaming wind storms , like the one that tore apart tents the day before our arrival			0
the smell and the heat -- 90 f when we were there , certain to be 110 or more by august -- follow you everywhere and trash is piled high along parts of the rutted dirt and mud pathways			0
@entity13 's parents were doing the best they could , staying in the tent with a neighbor from their old village while they waited for a tent of their own and searched for work in the nearby village			0
the father was a roofer by trade and was trying to find a position that would allow him to get his family out of the camp to a better life			0
when asked if he would go back to @entity4 , he said of course it was his country and he loved it and would go back -- as soon as it was safe			2
as we finished our visit , @entity13 's eyes fluttered open and she blinked awake			0
this little baby is clearly cherished in the midst of the squalor and hardship that is now her family 's life			0
she and her parents and sister should not be forgotten in @entity7			2
it is an urgent and rapidly growing need , and we must all step up and help in a country that now faces yet another major challenge after years of war			0
