-- @entity1 , the @entity2 video - chat application , is not a replacement for real human interaction , especially for children , according to a new study			1
tween girls who spend much of their waking hours switching frantically between @entity9 , @entity10 , television and text messaging are more likely to develop social problems , says a @entity15 study published in a scientific journal on wednesday			1
young girls who spend the most time multitasking between various digital devices , communicating online or watching video are the least likely to develop normal social tendencies , according to the survey of 3,461 @entity23 girls aged 8 to 12 who volunteered responses			1
the study only included girls who responded to a survey in @entity31 , but results should apply to boys , too , @entity25 , a @entity15 professor of communications who worked on the study , said in a phone interview			1
boys ' emotional development is more difficult to analyze because male social development varies widely and over a longer time period , he said			2
" no one had ever looked at this , which really shocked us , " @entity25 said			0
" kids have to learn about emotion , and the way they do that , really , is by paying attention to other people			0
they have to really look them in the eye			0
" the antidote for this hyper - digital phenomenon is for children to spend plenty of time interacting face - to - face with people , the study found			1
tweens in the study who regularly talked in person with friends and family were less likely to display social problems , according to the findings in the publication @entity67			2
" if you eschew face - to - face communication , you do n't learn critical things that you have to learn , " @entity25 said			1
" you have to learn social skills			1
you have to learn about emotion			0
" the @entity15 researchers were not able to determine a magic number of hours that children should spend conversing per week , @entity25 said			2
social skills are typically only learned when children are engaged and making eye contact , rather than fiddling with an @entity79 during a conversation , he said			1
@entity1 and @entity81 are not replacements for actual face time because other studies have found that people tend to multitask while on video calls , @entity25 said			2

a few years ago , @entity25 worked on a study about how multitasking affects adults			0
he found that heavy multitaskers experience cognitive issues , such as difficulty focusing and remembering things			0
they were actually worse at juggling various activities , a skill crucial to many people 's work lives , than those who spent less time multitasking , @entity25 said .			0
