-- you ca n't learn charisma			1
the power of influence is one of the most unique powers that you can have			1
it 's not the power of controlling people			1
it 's developing a certain skill of communicating what you want to accomplish so that people will follow you			1
i did n't get it at first			1
what the f --- is i 'll ? i will be back sounded much stronger in my mind			1
so i argued with @entity21			1
and he said , " look , @entity22 , i do n't tell you how to act			1
please do n't tell me how to write			1
" after i saw it in the movie , i was so thankful to @entity21			1
that was a good lesson to learn			2
if someone is a good writer , stick to the script			2
i would always write down my @entity30 's resolutions and mark them off the way i mark off sets and reps			2
on @entity35 , you can just blabber out : i want to lose twenty pounds and i 'm gon na read more			1
but what does that mean ? there 's too many variables there			2
if you 're really serious about it , then write down when you 're gon na lose the twenty pounds by			1
is it march 1 ? is it june 1 ? make a commitment			2
the day is twenty - four hours			1
that leaves eighteen hours to do something			1
my father was a country police officer			2
all he knew was discipline , performance , and work â € ” not wasting your time			2
he came from an era where everything was scarce , so everything had to be useful			2
that 's why he was so against bodybuilding			2
he saw it as narcissistic			2
his belief was that you build your muscles by chopping wood or shoveling coal , doing something with your body that benefits someone else			2
but it was from him that i got my work ethic			2
the @entity73 in @entity74 in the early days of immigration , they just shortened the foreign name			0
they did whatever they wanted with it			0
but in @entity83 , there was something else : it had to sound cool			0
that sounded @entity74 , powerful			0
. ager ? @entity93 ? @entity94 ? what is this ? no one could pronounce it			0
so early on , they tried to convince me to turn it into @entity102			1
but eventually the idea became : if someone has a difficult time remembering your name , they will also have a difficult time forgetting it			1
let me show you how far we 've come with our fitness crusade : when i came to the @entity74 in the sixties , no one ever thought that one day every hotel would have a gymnasium			1
back then , people thought if you did weights you would get muscle - bound and die of a heart attack or become gay or an idiot			1
people thought weights would always be in dungeons			0
now they 're in hospitals			0
now even golfers use weights			0
when you get older , sex may change a bit			0
when you 're sixty - five , it 's not exactly the same as when you were twenty - five			1
but that does n't mean it 's over			0
it was one of my early goals to be a millionaire			0
in the beginning , i wanted to have a gold @entity141 , a @entity143 , a cheetah â € ” just stupid things that you think of when you 're a kid			1
the @entity143 thing went out the window , because when you get to the level where you can afford one , all of a sudden you say , " it 's a little bit over the top			0
" a cheetah ? i think in @entity155 they got rid of the law that says you can have wild animals			1
having a cheetah is a stupid idea			1
the best dressed men of 2012 in @entity163 , everyone is in your way			0
the government is in your way			0
the law is in your way			0
i mean , when my friend and i wanted to go start a bricklaying business here , we went down to city hall and got a business license			0
no one asked : what kind of school did you go to to learn bricklaying ? do you have any certificates that show you graduated from your trade school ? here , it 's go out and make it			0
just make sure you pay your taxes			1
i always tell my accountant , if you 're in doubt about taxes , pay more			1
i love paying my taxes ! saving money on tips is nonsense			1
give 20 or 25 percent			0
@entity195 investments are where the action is			0
the @entity198 i remember when i went into politics , the legislature wanted to create a blueberry commission			0
who 's gon na say no to a blueberry commission ? well , i said no. i thought they should fix the budget before they do the f --- --- blueberry commission			0
politicians admire the military people who go to @entity211 and risk their lives			0
well , how about having just 10 percent of that courage ? we must teach the future leaders that political courage is not political suicide			0
peace would solve a lot of problems			0
