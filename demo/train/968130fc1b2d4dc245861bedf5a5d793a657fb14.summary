-- by making public her story about how she dealt with the high risk of getting breast cancer , @entity1 has done a real service for women around the world			1
by letting us all know about her decision to get genetic testing for susceptibility to breast cancer -- and then , when the results came back positive , to have a double mastectomy -- she has bravely helped inform women with a history of breast cancer in their families about the need to seek out testing and counseling			1
for a woman whose career is tied to her appearance , her willingness to talk about her decision provides support to women and their partners who may face a similar difficult choice			1
five reasons we love @entity1 there are other lessons to be learned from her example			2
for one , reconstructive surgery is better than it was a few decades ago			0
for another , she chose not to have her ovaries removed , which some women do despite the resulting premature menopause and other hormonal changes			0
just as important is the issue of cost			0
many insurance companies do not cover the cost of genetic testing for cancer and other conditions			2
the cost of the breast cancer test that @entity1 had is prohibitive for many women			2
some insurance companies wo n't pay for elective preventive mastectomy			0
and still others balk at the cost of reconstruction -- denying payment on the grounds that it is merely cosmetic or aesthetic			0
@entity1 's choice carries risks along with benefits women with breast cancer and ovarian cancer in their families should talk to their doctors about the desirability of testing			1
if they are found to be at risk , not all will follow @entity1 's decision , since even radical double mastectomy is not a 100 % guarantee against getting cancer			1
my preventive mastectomy : staying alive for my kids as the @entity78 pushes forward into health reform , @entity1 's story reminds us that we need to adjust our health care system from one that pays for treatment to one that also covers prevention			1
