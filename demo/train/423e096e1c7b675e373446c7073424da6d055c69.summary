@entity0 -- @entity5 's estate never gave an expert it hired permission to help @entity8 defend against the wrongful death lawsuit filed by @entity5 's mother and children , the estate 's top lawyer said thursday			1
the revelation raised questioned about the testimony of entertainment industry consultant @entity14 , who was hired by @entity8 to challenge the @entity16 ' expert opinions concerning damages the concert promoter might owe if found liable in the singer 's death			2
@entity14 told the court this week that his company -- @entity23 -- had gotten a waiver from a @entity5 estate lawyer before agreeing to work on the concert promoter 's defense			1
@entity14 had signed a confidentiality agreement with the @entity5 estate in 2010 when he was hired to determine the value of its biggest asset -- the @entity35 - @entity34 music catalog that includes the @entity37 songs -- for the estate 's tax filings in 2010			1
he was hired by @entity8 lawyers in february to prepare a challenge of the opinion of an expert hired by the @entity5 lawyers to calculate how much money the singer would have earned had he not died while working on his comeback concerts in 2009			0
@entity14 said he -- or someone else in his company -- gained permission from the @entity5 estate lawyer @entity51 to waive any potential conflict of interest			1
" no one from the estate or any lawyers authorized or waived any potential conflict for @entity23 or mr. @entity14 , " @entity5 estate attorney @entity54 wrote in an e-mail read in court thursday			1
such a waiver would be counter to the interests of the estate 's beneficiaries -- @entity5 's mother and three children , a @entity5 lawyer said			0
despite the conflict , the judge ordered @entity14 to answer questions posed by @entity71 's lawyers about the music catalog			2
he said although his valuation placed @entity5 's interest in the catalog at about the same level as @entity5 's debt at the time of his death -- which he said was $ 400 million -- the @entity80 challenged it as low			2
an independent analyst hired by the @entity80 concluded he had undervalued @entity5 's interest in the catalog by up to $ 300 million , @entity14 testified			1
@entity5 lawyers argue it is evidence the singer was not broke when he died , contrary to what @entity14 said in his testimony			0
@entity14 testified this week that it was his opinion that it was speculative that @entity5 would have earned a dime more in his life if he had not died of a propofol overdose on june 25 , 2009			0
he based his opinion the testimony of a doctor who said earlier that he did not think @entity5 would have lived even another week past that date			0
@entity97 , however , pointed out that the doctor 's opinion was based on the assumption that dr. @entity101 would still be giving @entity5 nightly infusions of propofol -- the surgical anesthetic the coroner said killed him -- as a treatment for insomnia			0
the @entity5 's suit contends @entity8 is liable because it negligently hired , retained or supervised @entity101 .			0

@entity8 's consultant testifies @entity5 's estate waived its conflict of interest
a @entity5 estate lawyer *contradicts* testimony of consultant @entity14
the @entity80 is challenging @entity14 ' valuation of @entity5 's *share* of huge music catalog
@entity14 calls *assertions* of @entity5 's potential earnings " speculative "
