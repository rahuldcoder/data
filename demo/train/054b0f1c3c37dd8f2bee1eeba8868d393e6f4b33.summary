-- remember " @entity1 " ? the anti-gun documentary that attempted to politicize the tragic school shooting at @entity4 , @entity5 , was wildly successful , both critically and commercially , and even won its writer / director , @entity6 , an @entity8			1
but while the film was certainly entertaining , and may have even got some folks thinking about gun violence , it did little to move the needle on its presumptive goal : curbing gun ownership and weakening the @entity15			1
that 's because gun owners and the powerful lobby that represents them do n't care what @entity21 thinks of them , a lesson producer @entity16 will learn soon			1
@entity16 " reluctantly " told @entity24 that he 's planning a movie that will make the @entity15 " wish they were n't alive			1
" on friday night , in an exclusive interview pre-taped with @entity28 , he says that none other than @entity30 will star as an anti-gun senator			0
for so many reasons , @entity16 deserves a good , hard reality check			1
for one , there 's the obvious and almost comical hypocrisy			0
@entity16 's profited immensely from portraying graphic gun violence in films such as " @entity38 " and " @entity39			1
" his sudden attack of social conscience is astounding and curiously timed			0
in the same @entity28 interview , he says he 'll stop making movies that glamorize guns			0
but according to @entity46 , " @entity45 " and " @entity47 : a dame to kill for " are in the works			0
maybe he means starting ... now			0
for another thing , overtly ideological films -- think " @entity52 " and " @entity53 " -- bomb at the box office			0
theatergoers do n't want to be lectured by @entity21 for two hours on what they think is wrong with the country			0
opinion : when will @entity61 wake up to gun violence ? if we 're to assume @entity16 is motivated by a deep concern about gun violence ( and not sheer arrogance ) , then it 's also worth pointing out that he 's got the wrong target			1
the @entity15 represents law - abiding gun owners , not criminals			1
a gangbanger in @entity73 does n't care about the @entity15 , is n't motivated or supported by the @entity15 , and may not even know what the @entity15 is			1
in vowing to take down this powerful organization supported by millions of law - abiding citizens , @entity16 will simply end up empowering and emboldening it			1
and lastly , the effort most certainly wo n't rid the country of guns ( a goal he 's admitted to having , unless there 's another @entity83 in which case he very much wants a gun , or something			2
the @entity87 , a trade association for the @entity61 firearms industry , calculates that from 2002 , the year " @entity1 " came out , to 2011 , there 's been a 54.1 % rise in the number of federal background checks , one way of measuring an increase in gun sales			2
and remember , that movie was actually successful			0
proving the nation 's gun owners not only do n't care about @entity21 's dictates but @entity101 's either , in the year since the tragic @entity102 , @entity103 , shooting -- and despite significant efforts from the @entity106 administration and other @entity107 to push increased gun control , gun sales are up 8 %			2
@entity16 may find this lamentable and even reprehensible			2
he 's entitled to his opinion			0
and he 's also entitled to spend @entity21 money on a movie in which @entity30 is paid to rail against a constitutionally protected right and a robust and defensive @entity61 community			0
but i promise , every penny he makes will be multiplied manyfold in @entity15 contributions			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity122 .			2

@entity122 : " @entity1 " was successful film but did n't slow guns ' *spread*
@entity16 is planning @entity129 film , but she says mogul needs reality check
she says his films show *plenty* of gun violence and law - abiding @entity15 members wrongly target
@entity142 : films lecturing on guns do n't work and gun ownership has surged since @entity6 film
