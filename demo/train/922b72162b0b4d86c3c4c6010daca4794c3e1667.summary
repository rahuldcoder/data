-- the drama of an @entity3 woman who unexpectedly found herself in a @entity5 prison has just had a happy ending			1
but the plight of many other @entity3 citizens kept against their will in foreign prisons continues , as anxious relatives desperately seek for a way to gain their release , @entity15 's sudden arrest on by @entity5 authorities -- who alleged she was transporting drugs , a charge she and her family vehemently denied -- sparked a national outcry			1
it helped her case that @entity5 has good relations with the @entity3 other captives , by contrast , have become the victims of complicated political and diplomatic battles between the @entity3 and its foes			1
today , there are a number of @entity3 citizens languishing in prisons , some of them off the map , their survival at the mercy of powerful players with intricate agendas of geopolitical blackmail			1
for their families , the ordeal is emotionally devastating and becomes incalculably complicated as they try to figure out whose advice they can trust , how to avoid saying the wrong thing and how best to proceed to gain their loved ones ' freedom			2
@entity48 , the @entity49 owner of a tour company , was just sentenced to 15 years of hard labor , convicted for " hostile acts " against @entity53			1
his sister , @entity54 , said he was in @entity53 as part of his job			2
" we just pray " she said , asking " leaders of both nations to please , just see him as one man , caught in between			0
" if @entity65 has reason for concern seeing her brother in the hands of a regime with little international accountability , the family of @entity63 , who disappeared in @entity64 six years ago , is not even sure who is holding him			1
@entity73 , a retired @entity74 agent , was working as a private investigator on a cigarette smuggling case when he traveled to the @entity64 resort island @entity79 in march 2007			1
almost immediately , he vanished			0
with tensions running high between @entity83 and @entity84 , the @entity3 government believed @entity64 intelligence took him as a potential bargaining chip			1
but @entity64 denies knowing his whereabouts			1
for years , there were no signs of life ; many thought he 'd died			0
then more than three years after his kidnapping , the family received a wrenching video of the emaciated father of seven , his voice breaking , asking the @entity3 government to acquiesce to his captors ' demands : " please help me get home			1
" his wife and son posted their own video , describing @entity73 as a loving father and grandfather , begging his captors , " please tell us what you want			0
" six years after the kidnapping , secretary of state @entity113 called on @entity64 and other international partners to help , even though during a 2011 congressional hearing , sen. @entity112 said , " we think he is being held by the government of @entity64 in a secret prison			1
" another @entity3 , @entity120 , was arrested by @entity121 in 2009 while working as a subcontractor for the @entity3 government , bringing equipment to allow internet access to members of @entity121 's jewish community			1
diplomatic cables from @entity128 show the arrest came during times of heightened tensions between @entity132 and @entity83			0
@entity132 accused him of working for @entity3 intelligence			1
he was convicted of " acts against the independence and integrity of the state " and sentenced to 15 years in prison			0
a @entity121 @entity141 official explained that " ( t ) o demand that @entity121 unilaterally release mr. @entity120 is not realistic			1
" clearly , @entity120 was a trading commodity			0
@entity132 wants to exchange him for five @entity121 agents convicted in @entity145 in 2001 , one of them in connection with an incident that ended in the deaths of four @entity121 - @entity3 pilots shot down by the @entity121 military			1
the @entity3 rejects the idea			1
@entity113 declared that " @entity120 is wrongly imprisoned , and we 're not going to trade as if it 's a spy for a spy			2
" @entity120 ' family says @entity83 is not doing enough to help			0
the family has sued the contractor he worked for and the @entity158 , charging they sent him on his job without proper preparation , training or protection			0
it 's difficult for families to know how much to rely on the government 's help and how much to reveal to the public			2
the family of @entity169 , a freelance journalist captured in @entity170 in november , initially requested a blackout on the news			0
the fear is that raising a captive 's profile can make him seem more valuable to his captors and harder to free			2
that is a risk , especially in a kidnapping for ransom by nonstate groups			0
but @entity182 , @entity169 's employer , now says it is convinced that @entity169 was taken by the @entity170 government 's @entity185 militia and is being held by @entity188 's forces			2
also in government hands now is a @entity191 filmmaker , @entity190 , arrested by @entity193 authorities			0
his family says he was making a documentary about @entity193 politics			0
the government says he was instigating unrest against the government of president @entity200			0
president @entity201 , during his recent visit to @entity203 , called the accusations , " ridiculous			0
" when a government is involved , a number of possible avenues of release emerge			2
in fact , the release can be used as a sign of respect for humanitarian norms or of good will , aimed at easing diplomatic tensions without losing face			0
these and other family ordeals continue , with little public attention focused on the struggle of people held against their will , pawns in a game in which they wield no influence			2
for those wanting to help , the best approach is to listen to families ' wishes			2
if they want silence , that should be respected			0
otherwise , we should all @entity233 , post , write and talk more loudly about the ordeals of @entity3 held prisoner for political reasons			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			0

@entity242 : @entity244 's plea on @entity48 *reminds* us of @entity3 held *abroad*
she says a number of @entity3 citizens are languishing in prisons as geopolitical pawns
she says they 're held on trumped - up , *dubious* charges in @entity121 , @entity64 and beyond
@entity256 : we must let families take lead on *reaction* but be ready to raise voice for captives ' return
