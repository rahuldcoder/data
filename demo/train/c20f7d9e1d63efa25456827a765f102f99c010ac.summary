-- when 60,000 tinkerers arrive at the @entity3 this weekend for @entity4 @entity3 , kids will see original action figures designed on a @entity7 printer , homemade race cars , robots and a sewing machine turned into a music box			1
teachers will see a chance to reimagine @entity15 science education			1
parents should see a chance to replace the usual after - school and summer routines with activities that captivate kids in positive ways			1
i see a way to get kids to choose tinkering over tv			1
based on 16 years of hearing pitches about the next great thing in education , what jumps out is that demand from young people -- not the education industry 's desire to supply something -- is driving the maker movement			1
high - profile @entity4 events are the leading edge			1
a layer or two beneath , in church basements , children 's museums and public libraries dubbed " makerspaces " -- part high - tech shop class and part @entity50 hangout -- kids are showing up			1
it is this demand from kids like @entity53 , who was " super bored " before her uncle told her about the @entity55			2
@entity56 in @entity57 , that is fueling the maker movement			1
the @entity3 is part of network of disruptive leaders figuring out how to take this burst of maker interest and use it to improve science education			1
in a new book , " @entity66 : growing the @entity74 of @entity75 , " editors @entity68 and @entity70 of the @entity71 describe how traditional classroom approaches have suffocated science			2
schools caught up in the standardized testing sweepstakes tend to reduce classroom time for science			0
when schools do teach science , too often they are " telling students about science " -- and drilling for memorization -- instead of engaging them			0
elementary students receive science education for less than three hours a week			1
these same kids are watching tv nearly 30 hours per week			2
one way to activate student learning , as professor @entity93 has shown through his famous @entity95 experiments , is to give kids the right resources and some motivating content and then get out of the way			0
as with @entity102 's notion of " minimally invasive education , " young people are taking it upon themselves to decide what to make			1
preteens such as @entity107 and @entity108 are delivering classes and producing online shows for peers and adults who want to produce things with their own hands			0
thanks to innovative @entity118 foundations that launched the @entity119 in 2007 , the region is aligning science instruction in schools with the kinds of activities kids are doing on their own time			2
the aim was to set learning on fire , says @entity129 , executive director of @entity118 's @entity130			0
instead of picking off one or two strong projects to support , @entity131 invested in building a network			0
now , more than 100 groups are pulling in the same direction			0
@entity137 , executive director of the @entity138 , built out a 3,000 - square - foot makerspace , what it calls @entity142 , and is creating an additional 5,000 - square - foot @entity142 for kids age 10 and up			0
" museums can be labs for education reform , " @entity144 says			0
" no one can fail at a museum			0
why not experiment with education reform at a museum ? " the @entity151 , south of @entity118 , is integrating the maker movement into the core of its education mission			1
the district is " remaking education , " transforming traditional classrooms and the library into interactive digital learning labs			0
" it helped me learn more , actually , " says @entity161 , a junior			0
this is what @entity164 , one of the maker movement 's founding fathers , wanted all along			1
" what i 'm really interested in is an alternative way of engaging kids and getting them into science and technology , " @entity169 said			2
@entity169 is ceo of @entity175 , founder of make magazine , @entity4 and the @entity178			1
this summer , the @entity178 launched @entity179 , embedding 106 college students and young professionals from science and technology fields in 34 summer youth programs across the country , including the @entity118 children 's museum			2
the initiative expects to have 1,000 corps members working with kids by 2015			0
in 2007 , at the same time the @entity197 emerged , a @entity192 commission set in motion an education reform movement that included 26 states working together on @entity196			2
state by state , education officials are now deciding whether to adopt the standards			0
the question hanging out there is whether the maker movement can help @entity15 students move up the international rankings of science and math performance			1
" everyone is crossing their fingers and hoping there is this connection to be made , " says @entity70			0
" even though it 's hard to prove , we need to prove it			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			2

@entity218 says @entity3 's @entity4 *highlights* opportunity for education
he says teaching science to kids can be reimagined by teaching how to make things
he *argues* that it 's a way to get kids to choose tinkering over watching television
bare : the maker movement is *pioneering* innovation in education in *small* and big ways
