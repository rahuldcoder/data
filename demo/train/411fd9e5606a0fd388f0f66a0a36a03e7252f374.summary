-- @entity1 arrived wednesday in @entity2 as the clear front - runner for the @entity5 presidential nomination , while his rivals campaigned across the state to try to halt the former @entity10 governor 's momentum after his victory the day before in @entity12			1
@entity0 projected that @entity1 's second straight triumph in the first two contests of the nomination process gained him seven of the state 's 12 delegates , based on his first - place support from just over 39 % of primary voters			1
@entity21 rep. @entity20 , who finished second with about 23 % , picked up three delegates , and former @entity24 gov. and @entity26 ambassador to @entity28 @entity27 gained two delegates based on his third - place finish with roughly 17 % of the vote			2
former house speaker @entity32 and former @entity34 sen. @entity33 got no delegates for their support of just under 10 % each , and @entity21 gov. @entity37 also was shut out by trailing with less than 1 % of the vote			2
with 1,144 delegates needed to secure the nomination , the @entity12 haul was more symbolic than substantive , but it further bolstered @entity1 's campaign after his razor - thin victory in last week 's @entity45 caucuses			1
next on the primary calendar is the january 21 primary in @entity2 , where @entity1 's five opponents are counting on the state 's social conservatism and reputation for brass - knuckle political brawls to help their cause			1
the @entity2 has picked the winner of every @entity5 nomination fight since 1980			1
@entity56 told a town hall in @entity58 , @entity2 , that the result of the upcoming primary will be historic			2
" i believe the next 10 days are as important as any 10 days we have seen in modern @entity26 politics , " @entity56 said			0
" i believe that @entity63 are either going to center in and pick one conservative or by default they are going to send a moderate on to the nomination			0
" @entity33 , who lost to @entity1 by eight votes in @entity45 , said wednesday that it was " silly " for anyone to suggest @entity1 has the nomination wrapped up			1
" this is a long process , " @entity33 said while campaigning in @entity71 , @entity2			1
" half the people ( who ) voted yesterday were n't even @entity5			2
" @entity1 is hoping a combination of momentum , campaign cash , growing establishment support and a fractured opposition will lead to a victory not only in @entity2 but also in @entity80 at the end of the month			1
that would be four straight victories for @entity1 after @entity45 and @entity12 , and could bring the @entity5 contest to an early conclusion			1
in a sign of @entity1 's support , his campaign said wednesday it would report fourth - quarter earnings of $ 24 million for a total of $ 56 million in 2011			1
" i have a long way to go before i get the nomination , " @entity1 told @entity0 on wednesday morning			2
the other candidates will " find new attacks			0
( but ) i think in the final analysis people want someone who can lead the country back to strength with good jobs and rising incomes , and all these attacks i think will fall entirely flat			0
" in his victory speech tuesday night , @entity1 sounded like the presumptive @entity5 nominee , calling @entity104 " a failed president " who puts his faith in government while " we put our faith in the @entity26 people			1
" @entity1 is the first non-incumbent @entity5 in modern history to win both @entity45 and @entity12			1
@entity1 leaves @entity12 with wind at back for their part , the other candidates quickly tried to minimize @entity12 's importance and appeal to @entity2 's more conservative electorate			1
in @entity58 , @entity56 said that if elected , " we will not tolerate a speech dictatorship in this country against @entity119			0
" he also questioned @entity122 challenges to @entity5 efforts to require more stringent voter identification efforts in some areas			2
" what does it tell you about the @entity104 administration that they are afraid -- afraid -- to have an honest elections ? " @entity56 said			0
" they are afraid if we only allow legal voters			0
" @entity37 noted the fact that he had all but abandoned @entity12 , focusing his time and energy on @entity2			2
" @entity2 is a winner - take - all state , " @entity37 said on @entity0 's " @entity139			2
" " winning here , i can promise you , wipes out the caucus victory and @entity12			0
so if @entity1 's thinking he 's got it in the bag , i think he 'll be in for a great surprise in @entity2 when he shows up here			1
" are you in @entity2 ? tell us why you 're voting @entity33 , meanwhile , took aim at both @entity1 and @entity37			1
without naming @entity1 , @entity33 said electing a moderate would be little better than having a @entity122 president			1
" that 's not a victory at all , " @entity33 said , adding : " we want a leader that believes in us and is not an establishment candidate who 's going to do more of the same			2
" responding to @entity37 's claim of being the only true political outsider in the race , @entity33 noted that @entity37 " requested 1,200 earmarks as governor of @entity21 , and @entity37 's been in politics in @entity21 for 25 years , so he 's been in public life more than anyone else running for president			1
" @entity33 's campaign said it has raised $ 3 million since the second - place finish in @entity45 , with at least half of that planned for spending on ads in @entity2			1
@entity20 told @entity0 after his second - place finish tuesday that he expects to raise more money , and his campaign chairman said wednesday that @entity20 plans to spend $ 1 million in @entity2 , a significant amount in a state where television advertising is n't all that expensive			1
even if @entity1 is unstoppable as the @entity5 nominee , @entity20 and his aides made clear he intends to keep his campaign going , perhaps all the way to the @entity5 convention			1
the more delegates he can rack up , the more leverage he would have to integrate key messages of his libertarian , anti-interventionist movement into the @entity5 platform			2
" we 're on the move , " @entity20 said wednesday in @entity185 , @entity2			1
" it is n't only because you have a candidate			0
we have an issue , and we have a set of principles that we 're going to defend , and this is what motivates people			0
" @entity20 : only i can stop @entity1 in an interview with @entity0 before tuesday 's results came in , @entity56 acknowledged @entity2 will be vital to his presidential hopes			1
" we 're going to go all out to win @entity2			2
we think that 's a key state for us , " the former speaker said , describing the race there as a contest between himself -- a " @entity207 @entity206 conservative " -- and @entity1 , " a @entity10 moderate			2
" @entity56 has been pounding at @entity1 since @entity45 , complaining about a massive negative ad campaign against him by allies of the former @entity10 governor			2
a @entity56 - allied super @entity211 has already launched its own @entity213 barrage in @entity2 , and @entity56 and others have honed in on @entity1 's years as a financier with @entity216 , accusing him of getting rich by gutting companies and laying off workers			1
" the last thing you want is to nominate somebody who collapses in september because they ca n't answer the questions , " @entity56 said wednesday in an interview to broadcast on @entity0			0
" ... you know , people want to attack me for my past , that 's fine			0
i either will answer it and be ready to be the nominee or i wo n't			0
@entity1 ought to have to meet the same test			0
" @entity56 was n't alone in attacking @entity1 's business record			1
in @entity2 , @entity37 told supporters @entity1 's firm " looted " a photo company in @entity237 and a steel company in @entity239			1
" i would suggest they are just vultures , " @entity37 said			0
" they are vultures that are sitting out there on the tree limb waiting for the company to get sick , then they swoop in , they eat the carcass , they leave with that and they leave the skeleton			0
" democrats have joined the @entity5 criticism , with rep. @entity254 , who chairs the @entity255 , saying wednesday that @entity1 emerged from @entity12 a " wounded candidate			1
" " yesterday 's primary could n't have happened soon enough for him because his support in the state was rapidly eroding , " @entity254 said " as i watched it erode , it seemed to me the more people got to know @entity1 the less they liked him			1
" @entity1 seemed unconcerned in an interview wednesday on @entity0			0
" it 's been brought up every time i 've run , " @entity1 said , adding that @entity122 are trying to put " free enterprise on trial			2
" " but , you know , @entity37 and @entity32 are going to be the witnesses for the prosecution , " he added			0
" i 'm not worried about that			0
... you saw last night that approach did n't work very well for ( them )			0
and so we 'll take it to the next level			0
" at a @entity1 event wednesday night , @entity2 gov. @entity278 chided fellow republicans for making an issue of @entity1 's business past			1
" we have a real problem when we have @entity5 talking like @entity122 against the free market , " she said as the audience cheered			0
" we believe in the free market			0
" a former businesswoman , @entity278 appealed to the audience as fellow executives			0
" we want companies to be able to do what is best for companies , and during tough times you downsize and you make hard decisions and during good times you expand and you help those businesses grow more , " she said in her introduction of @entity1			0
" that 's what he 's done			0
he 's done what every one of us has tried to do			0
" @entity0 's @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 , @entity303 , @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 and @entity308 contributed to this report .			0
