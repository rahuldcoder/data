@entity0 , the owner of a busy graphic design firm , started giving herself -- and her employees -- four - day workweeks after she had knee surgery and found it tough to get around			1
it was meant to be temporary , and @entity0 only made the change because she felt guilty staying home while the others toiled			0
but she quickly realized the shorter week was less a burden than a surprise boon			2
from monday through thursday , her staff got in early to get their work done , and employees seemed genuinely excited to be there			2
people still had fun , but even the office chitchat seemed more efficient			0
and when they were at work , they worked			2
" they were using the extra day off to spend time with their families , do errands and take long weekends away , but also to schedule appointments they might otherwise have taken an afternoon off to attend , " @entity0 said			2
people ended up taking fewer vacations days , and sick days disappeared almost entirely			0
the notion of the four - day work week was introduced in the 1950s by @entity35 labor union leader @entity34 , but workers -- or , more specifically , bosses -- have been slow to buy in			1
by most accounts , the @entity35 workweek is now at its most saturated : nearly 86 % of @entity35 men and 67 % of women work more than 40 hours in any given week , in the name of productivity , financial necessity and , according to at least one study , happiness			1
in her book " @entity49 , " author @entity47 writes about a culture of @entity35 workers being on - call 24 hours a day , seven days a week , even as salaries and benefits decrease			1
that 's because , despite the evidence , we 're programmed to believe that working longer and harder begets great achievement			0
but what if working less is the real key to success ? earlier this year , when @entity63 exec @entity62 was hired as a company vice president , she reportedly negotiated a four - day workweek so she could spend more time with her family			1
much was made of the rumor , which @entity63 would neither confirm nor deny , despite the fact that many working mothers around the country routinely , and increasingly , negotiate four - day workweeks			2
in fact , 44 % of female doctors now work four or fewer days a week , up from 29 % in 2005			2
and yet @entity62 's four - day imperative sparked big debate : critics called the move entitled and questioned its fairness , while working mothers hailed it a victory , naming her a poster child for work - life balance			1
many have argued for the four - day workweek , or flexible hours in general , as a way to retain talented female workers who might otherwise quit altogether in order to have children			1
but a four - day workweek is n't beneficial to mothers alone -- and it is beneficial			1
when @entity95 introduced four - day workweeks for many of its state employees in 2008 , it boosted productivity and worker satisfaction			1
they reverted to the standard five - day week only three years later , because residents complained about not having access to services on fridays			1
in a 2012 op - ed in the @entity108 , software ceo @entity106 reported that the 32 - hour , four - day workweek his company follows from may through october has resulted in an increase in productivity			1
" better work gets done in four days than in five , " he wrote			2
it makes sense : when there 's less time to work , there 's less time to waste			0
and when you have a compressed workweek , you tend to focus on what 's important			0
( like sleep , quality work happens best when uninterrupted			0
) @entity127 also reported that the four - day workweek had made it easier to recruit new talent and retain valuable staff -- male and female			1
though unlikely to affect higher - ups like @entity62 , the four - day week tends to work best when the entire office is involved			1
one reason many employees may feel reluctant to take on a four - day week is because of the fear of " missing out " on access to the boss or to the flow of ideas and information			1
ten weeks after her first daughter was born , @entity145 , an environmental attorney in @entity146 , returned to work , taking the firm up on its offer to let her come in four days a week while everyone else remained at five			2
a month later , @entity145 found herself exhausted , constantly irritable , and nursing a persistent cough			0
" i was happy they wanted to keep me enough to be flexible , " she said			0
" but i always felt that the most important decisions were made when i was home relieving the nanny			0
" instead of providing some relief , the flexible hours that were @entity145 's , and @entity145 's alone , only made her that much more anxious			0
" i became convinced that once out of sight , i was out of mind			0
" putting everyone on the same schedule helps reduce that fear			0
there 's also the simple economics of the four - day week , as seen in @entity95			1
when the lights are on four days instead of five , and employees need to make the commute two fewer times , costs are lowered			0
for all these reasons , many employers who go the four - day route never go back			1
three years later , @entity0 's knee is healed but the four - day workweek remains			1
her firm has grown by 20 %			0
was it the change in schedule ? " i 'm sure that ca n't account for all the growth , " @entity0 said			0
" but it played a role for sure			0
now i joke that blowing out my knee was the best career move i ever made			0

@entity187 : employers find a four - day workweek increases productivity and *job* satisfaction
she says 86 % of @entity35 men , 67 % of women work more than 40 hours a week
@entity187 : it helps retain all talented workers , not just the women who want to be with kids
to make it work , employers should put the whole staff on the four - day week , she says
