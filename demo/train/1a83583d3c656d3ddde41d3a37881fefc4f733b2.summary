@entity4 , who is gravely ill with severe pneumonia , is being cared for at a hospital in @entity15 , eastern @entity0 , where he was moved on tuesday			1
three prison staff who had been assigned to @entity4 ' bedside have been withdrawn following @entity6 justice minister @entity19 's decision to authorize his release , a @entity22 spokesperson told @entity2			1
" the medical evidence clearly shows that mr @entity4 is very ill and that his condition has deteriorated recently , culminating in his re-admission to hospital , " @entity19 said in a statement thursday			1
" his condition is not expected to improve			0
" @entity4 ' son , @entity28 , said his father was " over the moon " that he had been released on the eve of his 80th birthday			2

" @entity4 ' legal advisor @entity40 told journalists that @entity4 was unlikely to ever leave his hospital bed			2
" this man is ill , he 's going to die ... he is going to stay in hospital , " he said			0
saturday also marks the 46th anniversary of the infamous 1963 heist dubbed the " @entity47 " that transformed @entity4 from a petty @entity1 thief into one of the most wanted men in @entity6			1
@entity4 and 14 other professional criminals made off with more than £ 2.5 million ( $ 4.2 million ) in used bank notes -- the equivalent of around £ 40 million ( $ 67 million ) today -- after holding up a mail train from @entity55 to @entity1 in the early hours of the morning			2
in the course of the robbery the train driver was badly beaten with an iron bar			0
most of the gang , including @entity4 , were soon picked up in a massive manhunt after police discovered fingerprints at a farmhouse hideout where the robbers had holed up to split their spoils			2
@entity4 was sentenced to 30 years in prison but escaped over the wall of a @entity1 prison after serving just 15 months -- and spent most of the rest of his life as a celebrity fugitive			1

" but efforts to bring @entity4 home were frustrated because by then he had fathered a @entity82 - born son -- @entity28 -- and authorities rejected @entity6 requests for his extradition			1
@entity4 continued to live openly in @entity12 , trading on his notoriety by entertaining tourists , selling t - shirts and even recording with the @entity99			0
in 1981 he was kidnapped by a gang of @entity6 ex-soldiers and smuggled to @entity102			0

in 2001 he flew back to the @entity6 on a private jet laid on by the @entity110 newspaper			1
he was promptly locked up in a high security prison but then moved to a facility for elderly prisoners			0
since his return @entity4 and his family have campaigned for his parole on compassionate grounds -- an appeal until now rejected by successive justice ministers on the grounds that @entity4 had never shown any remorse for his actions			1
@entity28 said his father had expressed regret for the robbery -- but not for the life he had led in the years since the crime .			0
