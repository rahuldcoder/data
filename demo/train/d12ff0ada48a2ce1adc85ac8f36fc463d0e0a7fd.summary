@entity0 , @entity1 -- almost a month after he was kidnapped , @entity4 's ambassador to @entity5 was freed by his captors on tuesday in an apparent exchange for a @entity5 militant jailed in @entity4			1
@entity9 was met at an airport in @entity11 by a delegation of senior @entity14 officials and emotional family members			1
he was kidnapped in the @entity5 capital on april 15 , when armed men ambushed his vehicle and shot and wounded his @entity20 driver			1
@entity21 appeared to be in good health and spirits as he spoke to reporters outside the airport in the @entity14 capital			1
he said he had been treated in a " humane " and " civilized " way by his captors			1
the ambassador said his kidnapping was an " isolated incident " specifically for the release of @entity31 , the @entity5 @entity32 militant who was serving a life sentence in @entity4 since 2007			1
" the exchange happened in a smooth and civilized way , it ended in a dignified manner " the ambassador told reporters			1
while @entity9 did not provide many details about his 28 days in captivity , he said members of @entity31 's family were involved in his abduction			2
in an interview with @entity46 in his hometown in @entity4 , @entity9 said he met @entity31 on tuesday morning			2
" i met him maybe for a minute this morning in @entity0 after he arrived on a private plane			2
i greeted him ... as was agreed between all parties " @entity9 said			2
" we did embrace and i wished all the best whether he was wrong or right			2
" @entity5 officials confirmed that @entity31 was returned to @entity5 , but refused to comment on whom he was handed over to and whether he was in prison or free			1
the @entity14 government insisted that the release was not a swap			2
" there was no exchange or swap or deal			2
... we dealt directly with the @entity5 government " @entity14 's foreign minister @entity63 said in a press conference in @entity11			2
@entity63 said an agreement to transfer @entity31 to serve the rest of his sentence in @entity5 had been in the works for months and the kidnapping only " expedited " the transfer			0
the @entity5 government on thursday announced that the ministries of justice of both countries signed a " memorandum of understanding " to allow the transfer of prisoners serving " sentences depriving of liberties "			0
analysts and terrorism experts have voiced their concerns over the apparent swap of @entity9 for @entity31 , who was was sentenced to life in prison in @entity4 in 2007 for a bombing plot targeting the country 's main airport			0
" this is clearly a swap deal -- the authorities in @entity4 and @entity5 can claim otherwise , " said @entity91 , a @entity5 analyst and a contributor to @entity94 's " transitions " blog			0
it was " a swap deal between the @entity14 authorities and @entity31 's comdrades and the best the @entity5 authorities could do was to facilitate this deal and set this extremely dangerous precedent , " @entity91 said			0
@entity91 and other @entity5 sources said @entity31 's family is known amongst the ranks of extremist and @entity109 groups like @entity110 in @entity111 and @entity112			1
" his return to @entity5 should raise the alarm bells for the @entity5 authorities and @entity5 's friends in the @entity117 " @entity91 told @entity2			0
@entity118 , vice president of intelligence for the @entity121 - based global intelligence firm @entity120 , echoed @entity91 's concerns			0
" we learned a long time ago that negotiating with terrorists leads to more threats , attacks and kidnappings " @entity118 , who is also a former @entity123 counterterrorism agent told @entity2 via e-mail tuesday			0
" unfortunately the exchange will elevate the kidnapping and threat profile for other diplomats in @entity5 , " @entity118 said			0
there are also concerns this could set a dangerous precedent for @entity4 , a key @entity123 ally that has @entity138 and other @entity139 linked militants in its jails			0
diplomats and officials have been frequently targeted by militias and extremist groups that have grown in size and influence in @entity5 since the 2011 revolution			1
the worst such attack on september 11 , 2012 , was on the @entity123 consulate in @entity112 in which @entity123 ambassador @entity151 and three other @entity123 were killed			1
after a string of attacks before and after the assault on the consulate , most countries closed their diplomatic missions in @entity112 where the almost daily violence in the city is blamed on @entity32 extremist groups			1
there have also been attacks on embassies and kidnappings of diplomats in the capital @entity0 , where even a prime minister was kidnapped for several hours in october			0
so far this year , @entity168 diplomats , a @entity170 official and a @entity172 embassy employee were kidnapped in the @entity5 capital			0
the two @entity172 , a diplomat and a member of staff remain abducted			1
in a video released last month by a @entity109 group , a man said to be one of the two @entity172 , was seen crying and begging the @entity172 government to negotiate with his captors			1
the group is demanding the release of @entity172 @entity32 militants imprisoned by @entity185			0
there are increasing worries about the rising threat posed by extremist groups operating in @entity5			1
a recently released annual report by the @entity191 on global terrorism trends singled out @entity5 as an area of concern and instability			0
" @entity5 's porous borders , the weakness of @entity5 's nascent security institutions , and large amounts of loose small arms create opportunities for violent extremists , " the report said			0
@entity2 's @entity204 and @entity205 in @entity206 and @entity207 in @entity208 contributed to this report .			0
