@entity0 -- president @entity2 on wednesday outlined his foreign policy vision and defended his record to date			1
what caught our experts ' ears was as much about what he did n't address as much as what he did			0
@entity2 lays out foreign policy challenges here are their takeaways : 1			1
partner in @entity15 still has problems : @entity2 's call for a new $ 5 billion counter-terrorism fund to " train , build capacity , and facilitate partner countries on the front lines " may find it tough going to achieve quick results			1
" these resources will give us flexibility to fulfill different missions , including training security forces in @entity15 who have gone on the offensive against @entity32 ; supporting a multinational force to keep the peace in @entity35 ; working with @entity37 allies to train a functioning security force and border patrol in @entity40 ; and facilitating @entity42 operations in @entity43 , " the president said			1
but the challenge in @entity15 alone may be significant			2
some @entity46 officials believe the problem there is that neither the @entity15 forces nor @entity32 operatives have fundamentally changed the territory they hold on the ground			1
both sides are maneuvering , both attack and counterattack , but even with @entity15 military efforts , the basic power on the ground does n't shift for either side			1
the problem with @entity15 's military remains its inability to sustain itself in the field for a long period of time			1
in @entity40 , a training program is running into delays over how to ensure those being trained are not extremists			0
there is a similar challenge in training @entity74 opposition forces			0
and in @entity76 , the @entity46 military is legally banned from working with some @entity76 units because those units have been accused of human rights abuses			1

looking through the right lens ? : the president spoke very little of the three - year civil war in @entity74 , addressing it primarily as a counter-terrorism challenge			2
he referenced support for the moderate opposition , a nod to a plan to increase training for rebels now fighting both forces loyal to president @entity98 and extremists linked to @entity32			2
but @entity2 made scant mention of efforts to strengthen the political opposition and glossed over the year - long effort to bring the regime and opposition to the table for peace talks that broke down months ago and now seem dead in the water			2
@entity40 and @entity109 were also treated mostly as a counter-terrorism challenge			0
the @entity46 helped rid @entity40 of @entity111 , but the country is now in the throes of a political crisis that is driving the current violence , which requires sustained diplomatic engagement			2
the withdrawal of @entity46 troops from @entity109 has also seen a lessening of high - level diplomatic attention while sectarian violence is again on the rise			2
the reduction of the @entity46 military footprint must be matched with a redoubling of @entity46 diplomatic engagement , and such a vision was lacking in the president 's speech by viewing these countries through a terrorism lens			1

what about @entity74 ? @entity74 was going to be the headline today			0
i think what we got was this partnership fund with other nations that needs to be approved by @entity140 and we 'll look for supporting the moderate opposition on the ground more			0
even if that does substantially change the situation down the road , the way it comes across here falls a little flat , especially with some of the buildup we 've seen leading into it			0
" @entity153 " is kind of the word here			0
some of what has tainted or dampened the stance that the administration has taken even in the briefing room day - to - day is that it has been pushed into a defensive stance			0
this was a sweeping speech that kind of covered everything and was a chance for the president to list what seemed like every accomplishment of his administration			0
but it came across at times as a defensive , lawyerly answer to critics			0
-- @entity170 , @entity1 @entity171 correspondent 4			0
military action as a last resort : administration officials were aware that @entity2 's now infamous " singles and doubles " comment during his recent trip to @entity177 struck many critics as small - minded			1
and they intended for his @entity182 address to place his recent foreign policy moves in the context of broader goals and values			1
on that count , the speech fell short of its target			0
the president instead delivered a familiar defense of current strategy with virtually no new policy announcements			1
at the core , he argued that after " costly wars and continuing challenges at home , " military action must be a last resort			0
" i would betray my duty to you and to the country we live in if i sent you into harm 's way simply because i saw a problem that needed fixing , " he said			0
the president 's strategy will instead continue to emphasize international partnerships and institutions			2
and he presented two of his most recent foreign policy challenges -- @entity213 and @entity214 -- as examples of where this strategy has worked , deterring a @entity219 invasion in the first , and bringing @entity220 to the negotiating table in the second			1
-- @entity223 , @entity1 chief national security correspondent			0

@entity46 officials still have questions about the @entity15 military 's ability
an *anti-terrorism* strategy without diplomacy is a short - term fix , president says
