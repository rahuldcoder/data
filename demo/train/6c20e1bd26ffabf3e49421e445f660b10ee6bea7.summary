in horse racing , there 's the trifecta			0
in entertainment , there 's the @entity5 for winners of the @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			0
maybe in the future there will be something called the @entity14 -- for holding down hosting gigs with all four major @entity17 broadcasters			1
the superfecta was trumpeted on tuesday when @entity19 confirmed that @entity14 will host and produce " @entity20 , " a two - hour special that airs on the network in september			2
@entity14 has existing relationships with @entity23 , to host " @entity24 , " with @entity25 , to host " @entity26 , " and with @entity27			2
in other words , @entity19 was the only broadcaster left			0
( unless you count the @entity33 - language @entity32 network ; @entity14 , are you boning up on your @entity33 ? ) @entity14 's new deal with @entity19 , and an extension of his existing deal with @entity27 , were first reported by @entity37			1
@entity27 subsequently confirmed that @entity14 has re-upped for one year			2
" this new deal will include hosting and producing 2015 @entity39 from the @entity41 events for @entity42 , contributing to @entity42 news , as well as hosting and producing specials for @entity42 and @entity27 , " a network spokeswoman said			1
there had been speculation that @entity14 would stop hosting the red carpet shows			0
what 's missing from the extended deal instead are @entity51 and @entity52			0
when the deal was originally struck in 2012 , @entity14 was named a " special correspondent " on the " today " show , which is a part of the news division , and a contributor to @entity27 's prime time coverage of the @entity61 , which is a part of the sports division			1
@entity14 told @entity37 that " he 'd like to try to continue working with both divisions and has already had conversations with @entity52 about collaborating on the @entity61 coverage in @entity68 in 2016 , as he did the @entity70 games in 2012			1
' today ' is less likely , given a morning radio schedule that has him in @entity73 while the @entity27 show broadcasts out of @entity75			0

@entity14 *signed* a new hosting deal with @entity19
that puts him in *business* with all four major @entity17 *tv* networks
he also extended his @entity27 deal and will continue contributing to @entity42
will he take on the sports world next ? he has his *eye* on the @entity61
