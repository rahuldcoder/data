-- " there 's a danger that something that feels easy to do and without risk to yourself , almost antiseptic to the person shooting , does n't feel that way at the point of impact , " general @entity0 , the former @entity1 commander in @entity2 , told the @entity13 when asked about drone strikes earlier this year			1
" there is a perception of helpless people in an area being shot at like thunderbolts from the sky by an entity that is acting as though they have omniscience and omnipotence , and you can create a tremendous amount of resentment inside populations -- even not the people who are themselves being targeted but around -- because of the way it appears and feels			1
" when the former commander of @entity34 forces in @entity2 is making this kind of warning about the drone program , things must be getting bad			2
the latest report by @entity40 @entity39 can only add to these concerns			1
@entity42 cites a whole raft of cases where civilians -- many of them clients of legal charity reprieve -- have been killed or injured by the misguided and shadowy campaign of drone strikes carried out by the @entity49 and the @entity1 @entity50 ( @entity50 )			1
read more : @entity52 investigator calls for more transparency the cases highlighted by @entity42 demonstrate the devastating impact of drone strikes on innocent people from all walks of life in countries such as @entity61 and @entity62 ; and his call for states to publicly respond to the allegations set forth only underlines the total lack of accountability which currently exists for the covert drone campaign			1
' resentment on massive scale ' but perhaps more than anything , these cases give force to the concerns voiced by @entity0 : that the danger of the drone campaign to the @entity1 and its allies is that , far from being the easy , " antiseptic " fix it may appear , it is in fact creating resentment on a massive scale , and making all of us -- whether we live in @entity81 , @entity82 or @entity83 -- less safe			1
perhaps one of the most devastating examples of this is the case of @entity88			0
@entity88 was an imam who locals say was killed along with his nephew in an august 2012 strike in the @entity93 area of @entity62			0
on the friday before he was killed , he had given a sermon in the local mosque denouncing @entity96			0
his nephew , @entity97 , killed alongside him , was a local policeman			0
so what did that strike -- that " thunderbolt from the sky , " in gen @entity0 's words -- achieve for the @entity1 ? it killed the very people it should be supporting in @entity62 : a brave religious leader , prepared to use his pulpit to take on @entity96 ; and a government employee who worked to enforce the law			2
" our family are not your enemy , " wrote @entity110 , @entity88 's brother - in - law and @entity97 's uncle , to president @entity112 ( in a letter sent last year which has yet to receive a response )			0
" in fact , the people you killed had strongly and publicly opposed @entity96 ... our town was no battlefield			0
" @entity110 has been very clear that , while he wants an apology and accountability for the deaths of his loved ones , he " wish [ es ] no vengeance against the @entity1 or @entity62 governments			0
" however , we can not ignore the destabilizing effect the drone campaign is having on those areas it targets			1
@entity62 vote ignored how can the @entity138 credibly encourage @entity62 down the path towards democracy and the rule of law when it ignores both in pursuing its policies inside the country ? both @entity62 's @entity144 and its @entity145 -- which is mapping out the country 's @entity147 future -- have voted overwhelmingly against the @entity1 carrying out drone strikes in the country , yet both have been ignored			2
the @entity1 -- helped by the @entity152 , which shares intelligence and provides communications infrastructure in support of the strikes -- continues to carry out bombing raids with impunity in a country with which it is not at war			0
the covert drone campaign has produced hundreds of stories of personal tragedy -- many of which remain unknown , due to the intense secrecy which surrounds it			1
@entity42 's report helps lift the veil on just some of those stories , but the majority will remain in the shadows -- despite the efforts of human rights investigators and journalists -- until the @entity1 and its allies accept that , at the very least , there should be some accountability and transparency in this deadly campaign			2
yet with the @entity49 still refusing to even publicly acknowledge that any such campaign is taking place , any such accountability seems as far away as ever			0
read more : @entity112 calls for review of drone use in the meantime , politicians and public alike should reflect on the warnings of @entity0 and the story of @entity192 , and demand to know how it is that this secret campaign , which alienates or incinerates the very people we should be trying to support , really makes any of us any safer			1
the views expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			0
