@entity0 -- @entity2 " clearly " suffered from insomnia that could have been caused by @entity4 , a narcotic he was getting frequently from a doctor other than dr. @entity7 , according to a sleep expert testifying thursday in @entity7 's involuntary manslaughter trial			1
@entity7 's defense team contends dr. @entity11 injected @entity2 with 6,500 milligrams of @entity4 during visits to his @entity13 , @entity14 , dermatology clinic in the last three months of his life , and that @entity7 did not know about it			1
@entity2 desperately sought sleep the day he died , worried that without rest he could not rehearse that night , which could force the cancellation of his " @entity22 " comeback concerts , according to @entity7 's interview with police			1
soon after he found sleep , @entity2 suffered respiratory arrest and was later declared dead by an emergency room doctor at @entity28 in @entity0			2
dr. @entity29 , a @entity31 sleep expert testifying for the prosecution , said medical records indicated @entity2 's insomnia could be related to " anxiety for performing , as well as use of drugs , medications such as @entity4			1
" @entity11 was never charged or disciplined for his treatment of @entity2 , but @entity7 's lawyers contend that treatment addicted @entity2 to @entity4 and caused the insomnia that @entity7 was treating when @entity2 died			1
@entity7 claimed the day @entity2 died he was trying to wean @entity2 from using the surgical anesthetic propofol to induce sleep , a treatment he gave him almost every night the previous two months			2
@entity7 told detectives that during the last morning he gave @entity2 a series of three sedatives -- valium , lorazepam and midazolam -- over a 10 - hour period before finally giving in to @entity2 's plea to again use propofol			1
" i 've got to sleep , dr. @entity7 , " @entity7 said @entity2 pleaded to him			1
" i have these rehearsals to perform			0
i must be ready for the show in @entity57			0
tomorrow i will have to cancel my performance , because you know i can not function if i do n't get to sleep			0
" @entity29 said the combination of drugs @entity7 gave @entity2 " was the perfect storm " that killed him			2
" mr. @entity2 was receiving very inappropriate therapy , in the home setting , receiving very potent sedatives , including propofol , lorazepam and midazolam , without monitoring by @entity7 , and ultimately this cocktail was a recipe for disaster , " @entity29 said			2
the trial " will be , in all likelihood , concluding a lot earlier than we expected , " @entity75 judge @entity74 said at the start of the 12th day of testimony thursday			2
lawyers previously estimated it would conclude around october 28			0
while there will be no court friday to allow the prosecution 's expert anesthesiologist , dr. @entity88 , to attend a medical convention , the end of testimony could come next week			1
dr. @entity88 briefly began his testimony thursday morning before the trial was adjourned			1
the judge agreed to let @entity88 leave for the conference in @entity96 where he will present a paper on propofol			2
he is expected to be the next and last witness for the direct presentation of the prosecution 's case against @entity7			1
@entity88 's testimony is expected to echo the opinions of @entity29 and dr. @entity105 , a cardiologist who testified wednesday , that @entity7 's treatment of @entity2 was so grossly negligent that it was criminal			1
@entity7 's delay in calling 911 for help as soon as he realized @entity2 was not breathing may have cost the pop icon his life , @entity105 testified			2
he and @entity29 both presented a long list of what they said were instances of @entity7 's extreme deviation from the standards of medical care , including his failure to immediately call for paramedics			0
" if these deviations would not have happened , mr. @entity2 would be alive , " @entity105 testified			2
the @entity122 coroner ruled that @entity2 's june 25 , 2009 , death was from " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with several sedatives , including lorazepam			1
@entity7 's lawyers contend that @entity2 used a syringe to inject the fatal overdose through a catheter on his left leg while @entity7 was away from his bedside			2
they dropped the theory pushed earlier that @entity2 may have orally ingested the propofol that the coroner says killed him			0
@entity7 's defense also contends that @entity2 swallowed eight tablets of lorazepam , a sedative , in a desperate search for sleep the day he died			1
@entity7 should be found guilty even if jurors accept the theory that @entity2 self - administered the fatal dose because the doctor was reckless in leaving propofol and lorazepam near his patient when he was not around , @entity105 testified			0
" it 's like leaving a baby that 's sleeping on your kitchen countertop , " @entity105 said			0
" there 's a very small chance the baby could fall over , or wake up and grab a knife or something			0
" @entity105 said he based his conclusions on @entity7 's own words to detectives in an interview two days after @entity2 's death			1
that interview was played for jurors in the previous two days of the trial			0
@entity2 would be alive today if @entity7 had called 911 for help within two minutes of realizing @entity2 was not breathing , instead of waiting about 20 minutes before asking a security guard to call , @entity105 said			0
prince @entity2 disputes @entity7 's version of events , family says earlier testimony revealed @entity7 did ask @entity2 's chef to send a security guard upstairs to help him about five minutes after the time prosecutors suggest he realized there was a problem with @entity2			1
the chef , however , testified that she sent @entity2 's 12 - year - old son upstairs instead of security			1
@entity105 said the use of propofol to treat @entity2 's insomnia was another extreme deviation from standards that contributed to @entity2 's death			1
he later acknowledged a recent report from @entity187 that the anesthetic had been successfully used to treat chronic insomnia , but he suggested it needed more study to be accepted			0
@entity29 , the sleep expert , testified that propofol has no therapeutic value in treating insomnia , and to use it is unethical and an extreme deviation from the standards of care			1
" it is beyond comprehension , " @entity29 said			0
" it is frankly disturbing			0
" @entity105 said he based his conclusions on his belief that @entity7 had connected @entity2 to an iv drip of propofol after he gave him an injection of propofol			0
that assumption , he said , was made because @entity7 told police he had used such a drip on most previous nights			0
when @entity213 challenged him to show where in @entity7 's police interview he said he used a drip the day @entity2 died , he eventually said " i will agree with you , it 's not completely clear			2
" @entity7 said he injected a small dose of propofol using a syringe , but the prosecution contends he also used a makeshift iv setup to keep @entity2 medicated and asleep			1
that drip may have malfunctioned while the doctor was not monitoring his patient , they contend			0
the prosecution has been unable to produce the tubing that would be a critical piece of an iv system , although they did show jurors an opened saline bag into which they contend @entity7 placed an opened propofol bottle			0
on the recording , @entity7 insisted he kept a close watch on @entity2 after he finally fell asleep			0
the physician never mentioned the long list of e-mails and calls that cell phone records later revealed			0
@entity7 was hired as @entity2 's personal physician while the singer prepared for his " @entity22 " comeback concerts in @entity242 , planned to start in july 2009			1
if convicted of involuntary manslaughter , @entity7 could spend four years in a @entity14 prison and lose his medical license .			0
