-- it 's the internet 's fault that , if the @entity4 has its way , you wo n't be getting letters delivered to your mailbox on saturdays anymore			2
after all , how many stamps have you bought lately ? but the engine of the @entity4 's demise could also save it			2
after all , how many packages have you received from @entity13 lately ? and would n't you like to get them faster ? @entity4 spokesman @entity15 says that while its letter - carrying business is shrinking , its package - delivery business is growing			1
( note that postal carriers will still be delivering packages on saturdays			0
) in its anxious search to make money any way possible , the agency late last year began testing a same - day delivery service in @entity26 for online purchases			1
while the experiment , called @entity30 , is starting out small , it also comes at a time when the world 's largest online retailer might be looking for a lot of trucks and a lot of drivers who can do same - day delivery cheap			1
@entity13 's strategy for consumer domination includes erecting million - square - foot warehouses near the country 's largest cities			2
the company has played coy on whether its expanding physical infrastructure signals plans to offer same - day delivery on a wide scale			1
if so , it will still need a transportation infrastructure to go along with it			0
and that fleet ca n't just consist of @entity53 trucks that @entity13 tells to go faster			2
same - day delivery requires a fundamentally different logistical framework from its standard system , logistics experts say			1
to get orders delivered even as quickly as overnight , @entity13 pulls together the orders at its distribution centers before turning the packages over to @entity53 or @entity62			0
the carriers then feed those packages into their own logistics operations , which typically means traveling to @entity53 or @entity62 distribution centers and depots before heading out on trucks to people 's houses			0
all of that transit does n't move fast enough for same - day			2
to make same - day work , the orders must travel straight from the distribution centers to customers			2
of course , @entity13 could hatch plans with @entity53 and @entity62 to offer same - day			1
unlike those two companies , however , which both have thriving businesses doing what they already do , the @entity4 has drivers with fewer letters to deliver and a desperate need to innovate			0
according to the optimistic logic of the so - called sharing economy , that seemingly dire scenario does n't look like a problem ; it looks like idle capacity just waiting to be leveraged			0
according to @entity15 , the @entity4 would n't need to hire new drivers or buy more trucks to offer same - day , @entity15 says			1
the agency would simply have to adjust where its drivers were going and when			0
" we already have the existing infrastructure in place , " he says			0
" that 's what sets us apart			0
" the postal service still has miles to go before becoming @entity13 's courier of choice			1
the pilot program is limited to delivering a maximum of 200 packages per day to customers of @entity108 's sister brands , which sell popcorn , cookies , chocolate and gift baskets			1
@entity15 says the @entity4 is planning to add more retailers soon			0
if the test is successful , which he says the agency believes it will be , @entity30 will roll out to other large markets across the country			0
@entity15 declined to speculate on whether the @entity4 ' 214,000 trucks â € ” what the agency calls the world 's largest civilian fleet â € ” could end up in the service of @entity13			1
but he said he believed the @entity4 will start to look increasingly attractive to other companies exploring the same - day option : " we 'd never close the door on ways to expand our revenue			1

@entity137 has hurt the postal service , but could also be its savior
@entity13 could go to same - day shipping , and use @entity143 postal to do it
@entity4 has a pilot program , @entity30 , that does just that
