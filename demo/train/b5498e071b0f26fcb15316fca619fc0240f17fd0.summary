third - placed @entity131 will now drop into the @entity32 regardless of the result of their final match against @entity152			0

@entity165 's 17th - minute penalty was followed by the first of striker @entity168 's two goals , then fellow striker @entity169 netted at the near post at the second attempt and winger @entity172 whipped a deflected effort into the top corner			0
@entity168 rounded the keeper and fired into the roof of the net 10 minutes after halftime before @entity177 converted a low cross at the far post , then @entity181 wrapped up @entity157 's win with 12 minutes left			2
@entity184 club @entity183 went through for the eight successive year despite losing 3 - 0 at @entity185 , who also qualified from @entity187 the @entity42 side led 2 - 0 inside the first 20 minutes through @entity190 midfielder @entity189 and @entity14 striker @entity191 - @entity192 , who capped victory with his second goal with a minute to play			1

@entity183 had key midfielder @entity202 stretchered off with an ankle injury in the second half , then @entity192 's late deflected effort gave @entity185 a perfect home record and put his side a point clear ahead of the december 7 trip to @entity210			1
@entity185 will face a @entity212 side who surprisingly crashed 3 - 0 at bottom club @entity214			1
