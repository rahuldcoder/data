-- the buzz began hours before the start of the race at the @entity4 : would one of the most - elusive records in long distance running set by a legend long dead finally fall ? it 's a question that has been asked at nearly every @entity10 track trials since the brash @entity11 set the meet record for men 's 5,000 meters in 1972			1
sure , there have been runners since who have been more than capable of breaking the record			0
they just always came up short when it counted			0
the record , though , was not the most pressing issue on @entity23 's mind when he stepped up to the starting line on a cool , crisp night last week at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27			1
his goal , he told reporters : a top - three finish that would guarantee him a ticket to the @entity32			0
@entity23 , who had already qualified for the 10,000 meters , was running against the @entity34 - born @entity33 , a favorite			1
unseen , though , was another opponent : @entity37 , whose presence decades after his death on may 30 , 1975 , at the age of 24 , has loomed large over long distance running in the @entity43			2
there are eerie similarities between @entity23 and @entity37 : both were born and reared in @entity27 , trained at the @entity47 and later ran for the @entity48			2
and both matured as runners following their first @entity10 appearance			2
@entity23 finished out of the medals in the 10,000 meters at the @entity53 in 2008			2
pre , as @entity37 was known to fans , was charismatic and brash , predicting wins and sometimes taunting opponents			0
his following was huge by track standards , with thousands attending his races			0
at one point , an opponent donned a " @entity69 " t - shirt to counter fans , dubbed " @entity66 , " wearing " @entity68 " shirts			0
at the 1972 games in @entity71 , @entity11 promised that if it came down to " a pure guts race at the end , " he was the only one who could win			1
he placed fourth in a heartbreaking finish after leading for the last four laps of the 5,000 meters , a race that saw @entity79 's @entity78 win gold in a late surge			2
by most accounts , he was a favorite to medal , if not win gold , at the 1976 games in @entity87			0
@entity11 died in a car accident hours after running his last race at @entity25			0
at the time of his death , he owned every @entity43 record between 2,000 and 10,000 meters and between two miles and six miles , according to stats provided by the @entity47			1
when 26 - year - old @entity23 took to the track for the 5,000 meters thursday at @entity25 , the same track where @entity11 set the meet record in 1972 , he already owned an @entity43 record in the 10,000 meter			1
the crowd of thousands roared with the start of the race , just like they had decades earlier for @entity37 's race			0
" this is the only place in the country , possibly the world , that you 're going to get that kind of reception for the 5,000 , " @entity23 said later			1
it was n't surprising that @entity23 led the last laps			0
the surprise was the finish , after @entity23 was overtaken by @entity33 in the final lap and then surged the final 20 meters to the finish line			0
@entity23 's time : 13:22.67 , less than two - tenths of a second ahead of @entity37 's 13:22.8			1
" to hear i got the record , that 's unreal , " @entity23 told reporters shortly after the race			1
" anytime you 're mentioned in the same breath as @entity11 , it 's a huge compliment			1
" but more than that , @entity23 's record - breaking run opens the door for @entity43 long distance runners to be considered contenders at the @entity32			1
only one @entity43 man has medaled since @entity131 won the gold medal in the marathon in 1972 and a silver medal in 1976 , and that was @entity136 , who won the silver in the marathon at the @entity139 in 2004			2
maybe , just maybe , @entity23 will bring home the medal that eluded @entity37 .			0

@entity11 set the 5,000 meter record at the @entity43 @entity10 trials in 1972
the meet record is one of the most elusive in track and field
@entity23 broke the record by less than two - tenths of a second
" to hear i got the record , that 's unreal , " @entity23 says
