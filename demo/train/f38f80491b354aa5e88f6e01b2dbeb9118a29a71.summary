to @entity7 's governor , a bill that would have allowed businesses to close their doors to gays and lesbians out of religious conviction was wrong for the state			1
so , she vetoed it			2
the buck may have stopped with gov. @entity12 in @entity7 on wednesday , but the fight to pass such laws bannered as religious freedom issues is still on in quite a few other states			1
" right behind it are @entity20 and @entity21 , " said @entity17 , a fellow at @entity18 , a progressive political think tank			1
@entity12 felt @entity22 did not address specific dangers to religious freedom			1
" it could divide @entity7 in ways we can not even imagine , " said @entity12 , who said she tuned out public pressure and made the decision she felt was right			1
attention now turns to the following states : @entity21 the @entity33 has been introduced into @entity21 's @entity34 , and it is similar to the one vetoed in @entity7			1
the measure , which is moving through the state @entity37 , allows a private company to ignore state law that " directly or indirectly constrains , inhibits , curtails or denies " a person 's religious beliefs			1
an almost identical bill has been introduced in the @entity44			2
much like the @entity7 measure , neither @entity21 's @entity37 nor @entity44 bills specifically spell out gays or lesbians as the target			1
the legislation is not on the calendar for monday , or " @entity52 , " the last day for legislation to pass the chamber in which it was introduced and transfer to the other chamber for consideration			2
but @entity59 executive director @entity58 said it could still appear on monday			2
his group opposes the legislation			2
@entity58 does n't rule out the bill moving forward , even if it does n't make the calendar			1
" this could still come up as an amendment to another bill			2
" @entity68 there are two bills being considered			0
@entity71 426 would protect people making decisions out of religious convictions -- including denying service to someone			0
@entity71 427 gives people protection against legal claims made against them in cases involving religious convictions			0
if passed into law , the first bill probably would be vulnerable to constitutional legal challenges			0
both bills could cause many disruptions to everyday life in the state , a state attorney general said in an article in the @entity91			1
@entity71 427 has been sent back to committee			0
@entity93 a bill is being considered to legally protect people against being compelled to take any action against their religion			0
@entity99 2681 does not explicitly mention gays , lesbians or same - sex marriage			0
it has passed the @entity44 and was referred to @entity37 , where it is in a judiciary committee			0
@entity20 a bill that requires the government to show a compelling interest in any attempt to restrict a person 's right to practice religion was introduced this week by @entity114 state sen. @entity113			1
@entity99 916 provides for additional civil protections to the state 's existing " @entity116 , " according to the senator			1
but critics of the law say it 's a way to discriminate against gays			1
@entity123 the @entity37 introduced @entity71 376 in december			0
it also does not single out same - sex relations for discrimination but gives legal protection to individuals acting or making decisions out of religious conviction			0
it 's currently in judiciary committee			1
critics say it 's aimed at discrimination against same - sex couples , @entity131 reported			1
@entity135 the conservative @entity136 is sponsoring a ballot measure -- the " @entity141 " -- that would allow private businesses to deny services that would support same - sex marriage			0
the group , which previously supported the effort to ban same - sex marriage in the state , is pushing to get the measure on the november ballot			1
@entity148 conservative senators introduced one bill that would allow businesses or people to deny " certain wedding services or goods due to the free exercise of religion			0
" but its main sponsor withdrew it			0
but there 's a second one protecting " speech pertaining to views on sexual orientation			2
" it has been deferred to a late legislative day			0
there are also states where proposed bills have already hit a legislative wall : @entity170 a bill that would have allowed people to defend against discrimination allegations on the basis of religious convictions was killed in committee , the @entity171 reported @entity178 state representatives introduced a bill in january that would have explicitly permitted religious business people and government workers to refuse serving same - sex couples			2
it passed the @entity37 , with a vote of 72 to 49 , but failed in the @entity114 - dominated @entity44			0
@entity186 a conservative senator introduced a religious freedom bill that would have protected people making decisions out of religious convictions that other legislators felt interfered with other people 's civil rights			1
the state @entity44 and @entity37 both voted it down , the @entity195 reported			2
@entity197 @entity197 legislators introduced a bill in early february that proponents said would protect businesses if they refused services to gays and lesbians			0
critics called it the " @entity208 " bill			0
the measure has been withdrawn from committee , @entity210 affiliate @entity209 reported			0
@entity213 conservative state sen. @entity215 introduced a bill similar to the @entity7 bill that was vetoed , but it has since been shelved , the @entity214 reported .			1
