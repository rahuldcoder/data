@entity0 -- dr. @entity2 defended his appellate lawyer from " a slew of disparaging remarks " just days before she files the appeal of the doctor 's involuntary manslaughter conviction in @entity10 's death			1
@entity1 has obtained sections of that 300 - page appeal , including the defense argument that the trial judge erred by not allowing the testimony of dr. @entity16 , a dermatologist the defense contended addicted @entity10 to @entity18 in his last weeks			1
@entity2 's appeal , which will be filed monday , also argues that prosecutors never proved @entity10 was hooked up to an iv drip of the drug that killed him			1
the defense theory was that @entity10 had administered the fatal dosage himself while the doctor was away			0
the coroner ruled that @entity10 died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol in combination with sedatives on june 25 , 2009			0
@entity2 told investigators he used propofol to induce sleep because @entity10 was suffering from insomnia			2
@entity2 served as @entity10 's personal physician as the pop icon prepared for 50 shows that were to debut in @entity38 in july 2009 , but his patient was fighting a battle for sleep between rehearsals			1
a wrongful death lawsuit filed by @entity10 's three children and his mother is set for trial next month			2

@entity2 takes a side in lawyer dispute @entity2 -- during a phone call to @entity1 saturday from the @entity0 jail where he 's been held since he was sentenced to four years in prison -- said he was " impelled to stand up for " attorney @entity58 , who has been involved in a personal dispute with @entity2 's trial lawyer @entity60			1
@entity60 was helping @entity61 , who wrote the appeal , until the two lawyers were involved in a jailhouse argument last january			1
@entity60 dropped @entity2 as a client after the incident , but the appeals court later ordered him to respond to requests from @entity70 for case files , which she said he had withheld			1
@entity2 , who witnessed the january incident between his attorneys , issued a strong statement of support for @entity58 in his call from jail			1
" in recent weeks , i became keenly aware that a slew of disparaging remarks and personal information about my appellate attorney , @entity58 , were unjustly released to the media and the public , " @entity2 said			1
" because of this injustice , i am impelled to stand up for this woman , for whom i have the utmost respect and confidence			0
" @entity58 completed work on the appeal even though " with the blink of an eye , all of her promised assistance vanished ; they abandoned ship , " @entity2 said			1
responding to @entity1 on sunday , @entity60 said he had no comment			1
" although she needed help , she did not quit , did not jump ship , nor did she succumb to pressure while others abdicated their responsibilities , " he said			0
" she held steadfastly to her professional and moral conduct , which was bolstered by her amazing mettle of mind and spirit			0
" @entity2 said @entity58 " stood up for me amidst a most arduous and challenging series of obstacles , and whose loyalty remains indisputable			1
it is my belief that she took a personal hit for me , and i want to let her know that i 'll forever be grateful			1
" @entity2 's appeal : @entity10 's @entity18 addiction although @entity2 could be freed in about seven months , he is seeking to clear his name and get his medical license back by having his conviction overturned on appeal			1
the appeal contends that @entity0 superior judge @entity122 wrongly prevented @entity2 's trial lawyers from making their case that @entity10 was going through withdrawal from a @entity18 addiction the day he died			1
" the reason it sought to prove that @entity10 was going through @entity18 withdrawal on june 25th was to show his state of mind -- specifically , that his resulting physiological and psychological state , along with the pressure he was under from preparing for the upcoming tour , rendered him so desperate for sleep that he would take the extraordinary action of self - administering propofol when he was outside the presence of appellant , " @entity58 writes			2
defense experts testified at the trial that @entity10 's insomnia could have been caused by the withdrawal			2
the defense wanted @entity16 and two staff members to testify about @entity10 's 23 visits to their @entity146 clinic in the three months before his death , including five in june 2009			0
@entity10 was given @entity18 during those visits , the last time on june 22 , three days before he died			0
" @entity10 could not sleep because of the @entity18 , " the defense said in pretrial arguments			0
" dr. @entity2 did not know that			2
@entity10 needed sleep because he was withdrawing and addicted , both addicted and withdrawing from @entity18			0
that 's important to our defense			0
in fact , it 's absolutely vital			0
" pastor , however , ruled that testimony from @entity16 and his staff would be a " distraction and divergence " in the trial			0
" the defense was also unable to prove whether @entity10 was addicted to @entity18 and going through withdrawal at the time he died , because experts in the case articulated they could not reach conclusions based only on reviewing @entity16 's records , " @entity58 writes in the appeal			1
if @entity16 or his staff had been allowed to testify at the trial , " it is reasonably probable that at least one juror on the panel would have found appellant not guilty of involuntary manslaughter , " the appeal argues			2
" accordingly , regardless of the applicable standard of review , appellant 's conviction must be reversed			0
" @entity2 's appeal : no proof of @entity183 the prosecution 's theory in the trial was that @entity2 hooked @entity10 up to an unusual makeshift iv drip of propofol and then left him alone to make phone calls in an adjacent room			1
@entity2 was criminally negligent because he did not properly monitor his patient who later died from an overdose , they argued			2
the defense argued that the iv drip only sent saline into @entity10 's leg to hydrate him and that @entity2 used a syringe to slowly push a safe dose of propofol into @entity10 's blood while he watched him fall asleep			1
a frustrated @entity10 could have awakened while @entity2 was away and administered the fatal dose himself , the defense said			2
" the propofol infusion theory offered by the prosecution 's expert was not supported by the evidence , and in fact , was so absurd , improbable and unbelievable that a rational trier of fact could not have concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish that appellant had placed @entity10 on a propofol drip on the day of his death , " the appeal argues			2
the prosecution built the iv drip theory based on testimony of one of @entity10 's guards who said he saw a propofol bottle hanging above @entity10 's death bed when he arrived to help revive him			0
an investigator also found a saline bag with a slit in it , which the prosecution contended was used to hold the bottle on the iv stand			0
defense propofol expert dr. @entity229 testified such an iv drip set up was " befuddling " because a propofol bottle comes with a hanging device			0
the hanging tab on the bottle was not used , both sides agreed			0
" the prosecution concocted the novel and ridiculous method of placing the vial into the bag through the slit , hanging the bottle upside down at an angle using the bag for support , and then hanging the bag from the iv stand , " the appeal argues			0
a piece of tubing key to the iv drip was never found , but the prosecution suggested @entity2 could have slipped it into a pocket before leaving the bedroom to ride to the hospital with @entity10			2
@entity58 argues that is " pure speculation , and the absence of evidence of a long iv line with propofol residue is fatal to the prosecution 's theory			1
" " if an iv line used in a propofol infusion had been placed in appellant 's pocket , it would have been dripping propofol , and resulted in a messy wet pocket , " the appeal argues			2
" such a result is not reflected in any photograph , testimony , or statement of any witness			0
" @entity2 's appeal : @entity10 gave himself fatal dose @entity10 got little sleep the morning he died , despite @entity2 's bedside efforts using sedatives , according to @entity2			1
" it is likely that @entity10 's heightened insomnia on june 25th was exacerbated by his surreptitious @entity18 addiction and the resultant acute withdrawal syndrome therefrom , " the appeal says			2
" @entity10 's last @entity18 injection was on june 22nd , less than 72 hours before his death , which could have been a peak period for the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms			0
" but he did fall asleep at 10:40 a.m after a single dose of propofol , he told investigators			0
after watching him for 15 minutes , @entity2 left him alone , the appeal says			1
" the evidence is consistent with a scenario in which @entity10 quickly self - injected the lethal bolus dose of propofol while appellant was outside the bedroom , " the appeal contends			0
" based on the toxicology results , it appears that the rapid injection lead to cardiac arrest and a quick death			0
" he may have had access to a bottle of propofol without @entity2 knowing , the appeal says			1
" @entity10 was very familiar with propofol , as other doctors had administered propofol to him , " @entity58 writes			2
" it is conceivable that @entity10 had obtained a secondary source for the drug , especially because @entity10 had been receiving nightly infusions from appellant for the previous two months , and appellant had sunday nights off			0
" if @entity10 -- not @entity2 -- administered the final and fatal dose , then it was not the doctor 's fault the patient died , the argument says			1
@entity2 's appeal disputes the prosecution argument that @entity2 was criminally liable even if @entity10 had administered the fatal dose himself because @entity2 should have known that leaving the drugs near @entity10 's bed posed a risk			1
the risk was " not reasonably foreseeable , " it said			0
the prosecution will have a chance to respond to @entity2 's arguments before the @entity336 appeals court makes a decision .			1
