authorities have not yet identified the other five sets of bones but say they might find others			1

he said he hopes family members of those missing could help authorities			2
police are trying to figure out how the bodies got there			2

the names of two dead men have surfaced during the investigation of @entity20 's death , @entity40 said , confirming a news report			0
one was a pimp who died of natural causes			0
the other was killed by a pimp after he killed a prostitute , the report said			2
the last set of remains exhumed at the site was nine or 10 feet deep			2
