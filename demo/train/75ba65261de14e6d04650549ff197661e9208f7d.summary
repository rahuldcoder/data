-- much like president @entity2 , the occupy movement is alive and well and entering its second term , thank you very much			1
it 's no longer about squatting in public parks , getting on the news , or -- in some cases -- getting arrested			0
no , instead this decentralized , bottom - up , @entity10 street effort is taking aim at your medical , student and other loans : it aims to relieve your debt			1
just as @entity2 appears to have left the lofty rhetoric of " being the change " behind him as he confronts the more practical realities of working a financial plan through an intransigent @entity24 , the occupiers have given up on winning media mindshare or public support and have turned instead to direct action that helps real people			2
in its @entity30 , @entity29 is just occupying the space where it 's needed			1
remember , @entity29 does not have leaders , an administration or some central office			1
it 's not a single body with a mission control that makes particular decisions			0
it began as a one - day demonstration in @entity41 , " @entity45 , " spawned by an announcement from the anti-corporate @entity44 magazine , and then mushroomed into similar encampments around the @entity47 and in other parts of the world			0
although police eventually shut down these demonstrations , the social and @entity52 infrastructure of the movement remained intact			2
people met one another over the course of the demonstrations , forged relationships online and continued working in their own ways			2
different members in different places have chosen to concern themselves with particular problems			0
those that resonate with others in the loose collective end up getting support from the various websites and @entity71 pages already associated with the @entity29			1
while there is no " official " occupy movement , when an effort gains support from enough of the trusted occupy networks , it can be considered a de facto occupy action			2
most recently , the movement came to the rescue of hurricane victims with @entity84 - a bottom - up , people - driven recovery effort that rivaled @entity86 for its ability to bring aid to the people who needed it			1
the occupy brand credibility , so to speak , as well as its existing networking infrastructure gave activists a great head start in connecting donors , organizers and providers to victims in the worst - hit areas			0
now , a growing contingent within the greater movement is refocusing on @entity29 's original victims , the hundreds of thousands of people burdened with all sorts of debt			1
many of the debtors owe many times the original amounts they charged up on their credit cards , medical bills or student loans			0
such debt is bought and sold on a debt market for pennies on the dollar by debt collection agencies and others capable of pressuring the debtors most effectively			2
( the reason debt is sold for such a small fraction of its acute value is that most collectors will not be able to recoup the money			1
they might buy $ 10,000 of credit card company from a bank or reseller , but most likely only be able to collect a tiny portion of it from the debtors , who either go bankrupt or simply broke			2
) in the belief that much of this debt is comprised of unjustified fees , inappropriate credit products or even outright fraud , an offshoot of @entity29 called @entity136 is working to erase it all ... by purchasing it , and then forgiving it			1
yes , seems it 's that easy : buy debt for a tiny fraction of its face value in the same way that credit agencies buy debt			1
but then , instead of attempting to collect that money , simply erase it			2
families struggling to pay for the compound interest on their 1990s medical bills , for example , simply find out that it 's been relieved			0
the whole debt - rolling operation , known as @entity156 , begins on november 15 , with a variety show and telethon in @entity41 entitled @entity159			1
occupy - friendly celebrities from comedian @entity161 and @entity163 writer @entity162 to music legends such as @entity166 's @entity165 and @entity168 's @entity167 will perform for a live and -- of course -- streaming audience while the website accepts donations			0
according to their estimates , every $ 25 will abolish an estimated $ 500 worth of debt			2
according to @entity179 , one of the founders of @entity136 and a leading voice in the @entity182 , " as a test run , we spent $ 500 , which bought $ 14,000 of distressed debt			0
we then erased that debt			0
" of course , in a perfect world , debtors would have the opportunity to erase their own debt at this rate			0
or , at the very least , on hearing that their debt has been relieved , the rescued debtors would want to pay back the movement so that more debt could be relieved			1
currently , legal restrictions and privacy policies prevent this sort of traction from developing			0
but if you 're in a tight debt situation and learn that it has been mysteriously and anonymously forgiven , you might want to consider doing the same for someone else by contributing			0
i understand why people might object to this scheme and can already envision the comments forming below this piece as i write			0
is n't this moral hazard ? did n't those people get in their own debt ? why should we bail out people who have gotten into trouble like this ? the best answer , of course , is that we already bailed out the banks and creditors -- with tax money			1
why not bail out the actual people ? and the @entity217 are not focusing on home loans taken out by aggressive real estate speculators , but the personal debt that has already been well documented to be ripe for abuse and fraud by lending institutions and their agents			1
( the easier answer is that if you do n't like this idea , simply do not take part			0
if you find your debt occupied and relieved , you can surely find banks and credit agencies willing to accept your payments			1
) more significant , at least from my perspective , is how actions such as @entity84 and @entity236 reflect a movement coming of age			0
true to form , @entity29 is making no demands of government , of banks or of anyone else			1
the occupiers did not involve themselves in the recent elections -- as if electoral politics were just too many steps removed from getting anything done			0
instead , they simply occupy the space around those in the greatest need and fill in for what 's missing			0
the opinion expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity256 .			1

@entity256 : the @entity29 , in its second term , aims to relieve your debt
he says @entity29 involved itself on the ground with @entity265 , providing needed relief
now , he says , the movement is holding telethon to raise money to buy , and then forgive , debt
@entity256 : banks were bailed out with tax money , @entity29 aims to bail out the people
