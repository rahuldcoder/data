@entity0 -- while the @entity3 was being awarded this week in an ornate hall in @entity0 , a small island nearby was shrouded in a cold mist that made it seem almost haunted			2
@entity7 has dropped from the headlines , but it remains fresh in the memory of many , including one of the @entity12 leaders who received the @entity13 , as the site of @entity16 's worst mass murder since @entity17 , the president of the @entity18 made a point of going to the island the very next day			1
" the attack was an attack on our values , " said @entity20 , president of the @entity18			1
" but our values are stronger than the attack			2
" @entity20 -- along with @entity25 president @entity24 and @entity27 president @entity26 -- accepted the award on the @entity12 's behalf monday , with the massacre of july 2011 already on his mind			2
it started with a deadly blast in downtown @entity0 that killed eight people			0
in confusion that followed , the anti-immigrant extremist who detonated the bomb drove roughly 45 minutes to a ferry that took him to @entity7 , the scene of an annual summer camp for young members of @entity16 's @entity43			1
he methodically gunned down everyone he could find and killed 69 people , most of them teenagers			0
@entity49 admitted carrying out the attacks , boasting that he was a patriot fighting multiculturalism in @entity16			1
he was subjected to intense psychiatric examination , found sane and sentenced to 21 years in prison , although under @entity16 law he could be behind bars for life			1
the @entity12 was honored with the 2012 @entity13 because of its contribution to peace in @entity59 , erasing old borders and animosities			1
it has also contributed to multiculturalism , eliminating some of the barriers to immigration in many corners of the continent			0
in some countries , the debt crisis is fueling anti-immigrant sentiment			0
in @entity74 , for example , the ultra-nationalist @entity71 party is gaining popularity in part because of the country 's changing economic and ethnic landscape			0
@entity16 is hardly an enthusiastic @entity12 supporter , even less a hotbed of xenophobia			0
it has twice rejected @entity12 membership and @entity49 has been regarded as an extremist or a madman			2
but with the @entity13 for the @entity12 and the the massacre at @entity7 , @entity16 finds itself close to both @entity59 's best intentions and some of the worst instincts in @entity59 history			1
@entity20 likened the two faces of his own brief trip to @entity16 to the two faces visible in the history of his own native @entity95			0
" we had a culture of literature and philosophy and mathematics , " he said , " and we had a culture of extermination at @entity103			0
" @entity20 said that @entity16 , a nation proud of its liberal , peaceful and tolerant traditions , offered an avenue of hope " the reaction of the @entity16 society , to say our answer to the gunman is more democracy , more respect and to fight more for our values - that was the right answer , a good example for the whole world			0
" a famous peace prize and an infamous murder scene : two different worlds less than one hour apart .			1
