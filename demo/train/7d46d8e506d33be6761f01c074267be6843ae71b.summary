-- back in 1977 , @entity1 made his directorial debut with a low - budget , high - octane car - crash comedy called " @entity5 " as first impressions go , it did not signal the second coming of @entity9			1
but the freckle - faced former " @entity12 " star radiated an infectious delight in smashing as many roaring muscle cars as he could get away with			0
since then , of course , @entity1 has become one of @entity18 's most consistent and respected filmmakers , crafting well - made crowd - pleasers that tackle more highbrow subjects			1
but judging from his white - knuckle new film , " @entity22 , " he has n't outgrown his youthful sweet tooth for four - wheeled mayhem			2
he still has hot rods and the death - defying men who drive them on his mind			0
based on the real - life rivalry between @entity32 racing legends @entity30 and @entity33 , " @entity22 " is a tale of two opposite personalities eyeing the same checkered - flag goal : winning the 1976 world championship			1
@entity39 draws the flashier role in @entity30 , a fast - burning @entity41 bad boy with flowing blond locks , silk shirts unbuttoned to his navel , and a rakish playboy swagger			1
on and off the track , he 's wild , cocky , and undisciplined — a deadly combination when you 're strapped into a coffin on wheels going 170 miles an hour			2
'' the closer you are to death , the more alive you feel , '' @entity39 's @entity30 says			1
and it 's thanks to the " @entity56 " star 's champagne - spraying charisma that he makes risking your neck look like the coolest job on the planet			2
as @entity33 , " @entity64 ' " @entity61 buries his boyish good looks behind ratlike prosthetic teeth			1
with his clipped @entity69 accent , everything that comes out of his mouth sounds like a brusque insult			0
he may not be a particularly likable fellow , but he 's a methodical grinder with the unshakable conviction of someone who 's calculated the odds on what it takes to win			0
pitted against each other , they 're like @entity81 and the @entity82			0
it 's not just about beating the other guy , it 's about humiliating him in the process			0
@entity0 : ' @entity22 ' : @entity87 , @entity39 in high - octane scene @entity1 's film is at its best when the rubber meets the road			1
" @entity22 " traces the thrilling , neck - and - neck 1976 season from start to finish , hopscotching from @entity96 to @entity97 to @entity98			0
even though the film hurtles from one exotic locale to the next , the speedway sequences never feel repetitive — and they never let up on the gas			0
more than in any racing movie since 1966 's " @entity105 , " the action scenes capture the daredevil kick of sitting in the cramped , claustrophobic cockpit of a @entity108 , zipping around hairpin turns as tires squeal and engines roar			1
things are n't quite as thrilling off the track			0
when they 're not putting the pedal to the metal , @entity33 and @entity30 are painted as broad archetypes — the bad and the beautiful			1
it does n't help that both men are given a perfunctory love interest ( @entity87 for @entity39 and @entity121 ) , neither of whom feels fleshed out or is given much to do other than look worried			2
they 're as much spectators as the fans in the stands			0
it 's only in the last third of the film that @entity30 and @entity33 become flesh - and - blood human beings instead of videogame avatars			1
jockeying with each other to become the leader in the standings , the two men arrive at @entity138 's @entity137 track , where drizzly conditions prove why the harrowing course is called the @entity141			2
@entity33 , ahead in points , argues that it 's too dangerous to race and that the event should be canceled , while @entity30 uses his back - slapping charm to get the other drivers to vote @entity33 down			1
naturally , disaster follows as @entity33 , barely able to see through his rain - soaked visor , crashes in a grisly fireball , horrifically burning his face and lungs			1
as he struggles to recover in the hospital , @entity30 closes in on first place , which in turn fuels his enemy to rehabilitate faster and return to battle			2
the thought of a man covered in monstrous third - degree scars wincing in agony as he pulls his racing helmet over his head so that he can get back behind the wheel may sound insane			0
but as both @entity1 and millions of racing fans around the world know , it 's also compelling human drama			1
" @entity22 " hits a few potholes , but in the end it reveals the psyches of two men who only feel alive when they 're cheating death			0
