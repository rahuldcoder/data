gov. @entity9 , who suspended their sentences , said wednesday that @entity12 , 36 , must donate a kidney to her sister , @entity14 , 38			1
each of the @entity1 got two life sentences after they were convicted by a jury of robbing two people near the town of @entity20			1
although they would be eligible for parole in 2014 , the @entity30 " believes the sisters no longer pose a threat to society " and their incarceration is no longer necessary for rehabilitation , @entity9 said in a statement			1
@entity32 's kidney dialysis treatment creates a substantial cost to the state , said @entity9			1
@entity2 corrections commissioner @entity35 , who agreed with the decision to suspend the sentences , said @entity32 's three - times - a - week dialysis costs the state about $ 190,000 a year			1
the @entity40 ' attorney , @entity39 , said @entity12 previously offered to make the kidney donation			2
the announcement pleased the @entity43 and other civil rights advocates , who have pressed for the sisters ' release in rallies and at other forums			1
" we need more days like this in @entity2 , " @entity43 president @entity50 said at a news conference thursday at the @entity53 building in @entity54			1
" we need more days like this in our country			2
" @entity50 said he hoped @entity9 's decision served notice to governors in other states where incarcerations are being challenged " that they have a big role to play in advancing justice			1
" @entity39 praised the decision but said he believed it was the medical situation that brought the sisters ' story to the media 's attention , rather than the injustice of their conviction			2
he said he hoped this case would bring further attention to " the story of a lot our people who are in jail who ought not be			0
" " it was bad when they were convicted in the first place , " the attorney said of the @entity40			0
" it was bad when they were sentenced to two life terms ( for a crime ) for which most people would n't serve a day in jail for			2
" @entity39 said that while he believes @entity9 suspended the sentences " for political reasons , " he said the act nonetheless " bespoke a sense of humanity " and thanked him for doing it			1
@entity39 contends the sisters were not involved in the robbery and that there were discrepancies in testimony			2
the convictions and sentences were upheld in 1996 by the @entity106			2
in 1993 , @entity12 and @entity32 were arrested and charged with leading two men into an ambush in @entity109 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity110			0
court records show the men were robbed by three teenagers who hit them with a shotgun and took their wallets			0
according to @entity117 , in @entity54 , @entity2 , the sisters had pleaded not guilty as accessories but were convicted of armed robbery , while the three accomplices received lesser sentences and since have been released			1
" regardless of what you think of the convictions , they have served more time than they should have served , " @entity39 said			0
both of the sisters say they would like to go to @entity128 to be with their mother and their children , but details must be worked out by corrections officials , @entity39 said			2
they are housed in different parts of a prison in @entity135 , just outside @entity54			0
their mother , @entity136 , said thursday she was driving when she got the news			1
" i just went hysterical			0
i had to stop the car , " she said			2
" i got so emotional , thanking @entity140 that finally this has come to an end			0
" it was not clear when the release may occur			2
@entity39 told @entity0 it may take about seven days , but @entity145 said it will be closer to 45 days			0
@entity2 officials will work with counterparts in @entity128 to ensure certain conditions are met , said @entity145 , adding the women would then have to report to a @entity128 probation and parole officer			1
@entity9 said the state @entity152 reviewed the sisters ' request for a pardon and " recommended that i neither pardon them , nor commute their sentence			1
" at my request , the @entity152 subsequently reviewed whether the sisters should be granted an indefinite suspension of sentence , which is tantamount to parole , and have concurred with my decision to suspend their sentences indefinitely			1
" the kidney donation " should be scheduled with urgency , " @entity9 said			1
@entity39 , who called the situation a human rights case , said the dialysis equipment at the prison was sometimes faulty and infections were an issue			0
but @entity145 said " we have provided quality care " and complications in dialysis sometimes occur			0
the state spent about $ 50 million in inmate medical care in 2010 , he said			0
neither of the @entity1 had a previous record , @entity39 said			0
@entity145 said each have some rules violations reports while serving in prison , but not for anything serious			0

the governor " brought closure to this issue , " @entity191 said			0
