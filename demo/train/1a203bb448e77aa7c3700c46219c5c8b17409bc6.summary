@entity0 -- after centuries buried beneath the @entity9 , and decades hidden away inside the @entity10 , the bones of a man long believed to be @entity4 , one of the founding fathers of the @entity7 , are on display for the first time			1
the controversial remains were revealed to the public on sunday at a mass in @entity16 marking the conclusion of the @entity19 's " @entity18			1
" writing in @entity21 , the semi-official @entity10 newspaper , archbishop @entity20 said the " relics which tradition recognizes as those of the apostle who gave his life for the lord " would be exhibited as part of the service			0
@entity21 reports that 8.5 million pilgrims have venerated the relics over the course of the year			0
but whether the bones , normally kept in an urn housed in the private chapel of the @entity36 's own @entity9 apartments , really are those of @entity4 , the fisherman - turned - disciple who became the first pope , is open to question			1
tradition has it that @entity4 was martyred -- by being crucified , upside down -- in @entity42 in a.d. 64			2
before being buried in the city			0
in his book " the @entity49 , " @entity44 wrote that " @entity4 's tomb in the cemetery on the @entity52 became ... a popular pilgrimage site , " prompting the emperor @entity46 to build a basilica in his honor in the 4th century			2
the remains which will be revealed on sunday were among those discovered during an archaeological dig begun on the site in 1939 ; in 1968 the then pope , @entity58 , declared that they had been identified " in a manner which we believe convincing			1
" but with no dna evidence to conclusively prove their identity , whether they belong to @entity4 is likely to remain an enduring mystery			2
@entity1 's @entity10 analyst @entity65 says that like so much concerning religion , the belief that the bones are those of the disciple comes down to faith			0
" like other famous relics , such as the @entity74 or the @entity75 , they evoke awe and devotion regardless of their actual provenance , " @entity65 writes in an @entity71 for @entity1			0
" @entity82 , as the @entity80 puts it , lies in ' the evidence of things not seen			0
' " read more : the bones of @entity4 and the eyes of faith read more : would the @entity89 target @entity90 ? read more : new , popular pope , but same old church ? read more : @entity36 embraces severely disfigured man			1
