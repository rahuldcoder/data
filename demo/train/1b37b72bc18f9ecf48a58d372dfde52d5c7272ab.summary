attorneys and a federal judge are expected to meet in a @entity3 courtroom friday afternoon for a status hearing regarding the pending criminal trial of @entity6 , the former presidential candidate and @entity8 senator			1
the hearing comes after attorneys on both sides filed several motions , many of them sealed from the public			0
in december , attorneys for @entity6 asked again to delay his criminal trial , saying @entity6 had an unspecified medical issue			1
last year , the @entity18 charged @entity6 with conspiracy , issuing false statements and violating campaign contribution laws			0
he has pleaded not guilty			0
last september , the trial was delayed until january 30 after @entity6 ' attorneys said he needed more time , in part due to his position as the sole caretaker of his two youngest children , ages 11 and 13 , after his wife , @entity29 , passed away in december 2010			1
the motion to continue the trial for 60 days filed on december 22 said @entity6 ' " unexpected " medical issue is explained in a sealed exhibit			1
the issue will " prevent a trial of this matter during the january 2012 criminal term , " according to the motion , and can not be resolved before the end of the term			0
attorneys for @entity6 , who was the @entity41 vice-presidential nominee in 2004 alongside @entity42 , also say in the motion a january trial would not give them enough time to prepare , especially given the " unusual and complex " prosecution			1
" since this trial date was set , the government has produced as part of the discovery process an additional 103,102 pages of material including more than 91,000 e-mails as well as 26 voicemails received by cooperating witnesses between 2007 and 2010 , " the motion says			0
in addition , both the government and @entity6 are seeking evidence from @entity3 state courts			1
" absent a continuance , mr. @entity6 ' counsel will not be able to effectively use the evidence the government was obligated to provide him ... and this , in turn , threatens mr. @entity6 ' right to effective counsel and a fair trial , " according to the motion			1
" this is not hyperbole			0
mr. @entity6 ' counsel are experienced trial lawyers and they are and have been working hard -- long hours , late nights and weekends -- and they have not made it their practice to seek unwarranted continuances			2
" it is unclear if a decision has been made on whether the trial has been delayed			0
a chief issue in the upcoming trial is whether money given to support @entity6 ' mistress , @entity82 , by the then - candidate 's benefactors should have been considered campaign donations , a contention @entity6 ' team has disputed			2
they maintain the money was a gift to @entity91			0
if convicted on all counts , @entity6 could face 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 1.5 million .			2

the trial was set to start january 30 after a delay in september
@entity6 ' attorneys are asking for 60 more days
they say they need time to review evidence provided by prosecutors
