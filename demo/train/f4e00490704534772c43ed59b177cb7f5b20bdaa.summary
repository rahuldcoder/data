@entity0 -- furniture made infamous by crime scene photos shown in the trial of @entity6 's doctor go on the auction block in @entity8 saturday			1
the table where @entity6 's sedatives sat and the rug on which paramedics tried to revive him are among more than 500 pieces of fine art and home furnishings that filled @entity6 's rented mansion , the house where he died on june 25 , 2009			1
@entity19 has been careful not to call it a @entity6 auction out of legal and public relations concerns , instead marketing it as by the mansion 's now - famous address -- 100 @entity26			1
@entity6 did not own the beds , chairs , clocks , paintings , dishes and other items , but their value may skyrocket because of the personal touch added by the pop icon and his children in the months before he died			2
without the connection to @entity6 , the property might bring $ 400,000 , @entity37 said			0
but with it " the sky 's the limit , " @entity40 's executive director @entity37 said			2
a chalkboard left behind in @entity6 's kitchen may have cost a few hundred dollars , but what his children wrote on it makes it a very valuable object , @entity37 said			1
the note , handwritten on the black board attached to a 26 - inch - tall ceramic rooster , reads " love @entity53 / i ( heart ) @entity53 / smile it 's for free			2
" it sat in the kitchen where , according to testimony in the trial of dr. @entity61 , @entity6 would eat lunch each day with @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
it was not known which child wrote the chalk note , but @entity37 said his research suggested it was from @entity64 , who was 11 when her father died			0
another striking piece is @entity74 revival style armoire from the @entity6 's master bedroom			2
on the mirror , presumably where @entity6 looked each day as he dressed , is a handwritten message of inspiration : " train , perfection march april full out may			0
" the wax - pencil note is significant , considering that @entity6 was battling the calendar as he prepared for his " @entity86 " concerts set to premiere in @entity85 in july 2009			0
dr. @entity61 's defense lawyers argued during the trial that the intense pressure on @entity6 to rehearse for the 50 shows put him in a desperate fight for sleep , which led to dr. @entity61 administering the surgical anesthetic propofol nearly every night in the last two months of his life			0
@entity19 backed away from selling the bed in which @entity6 received the fatal dose of the propofol after a personal request from his mother , @entity100 , @entity40 's executive director @entity37 said			1
the auction house 's recreation of the bedroom where @entity6 died -- euphemistically called " the medicine room " by the company -- features a bed - sized memorial covered with love notes from @entity6 fans instead of the death bed			1
the nightstand seen next to the death bed in coroner 's photos , bearing numerous bottles of sedatives and other drugs , is for sale			0
the " @entity119 occasional table " is listed for between $ 300 and $ 500			0
the room - size oriental rug that covered the floor where @entity6 was placed when paramedics tried to revive him is listed in the auction catalogue for between $ 400 and $ 600			1
the couch and chairs where @entity6 likely sat with show producers worried about his health in the days before his death are for sale			0
one chair in @entity6 's bedroom has a stain which @entity37 suggested was make up spilled by the star as he sat in front of a mirror			2
none of @entity6 's relatives have expressed an interest in any of the items , @entity37 said			2
he pointed out that they had a chance to take whatever they wanted from the house in the months after his death			0
the notes and posters brought to the auction house by @entity6 fans and placed on the " medicine room " memorial will be sent to @entity6 's mother and children , he said			1
@entity6 's relationship with @entity40 's turned sour in the last months of his life when he filed a lawsuit to stop the sale of furnishings from his neverland ranch			1
the singer sued the auction company , claiming he did not authorize the sale of items that were removed from @entity157 after he sold the ranch			0
the suit was settled in april 2009 when @entity40 's canceled the auction and later returned the items to @entity6 .			1

auction *includes* a chalkboard love note from @entity6 's children
the bed he died in will not be sold at @entity6 's mother 's request
the rug on which paramedics tried to revive @entity6 is on the auction list
@entity40 's will auction more than 500 items from 100 @entity26 on saturday
