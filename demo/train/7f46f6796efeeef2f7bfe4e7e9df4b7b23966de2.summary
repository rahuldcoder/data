for a while , @entity0 faded from the collective consciousness			1
but what 's happening there should make people sit up and take notice			2
extremist militants have overrun @entity8 , the country 's second - largest city			2
as many as half a million civilians have fled their homes to escape the violence , and the brazen incursion has highlighted all the weaknesses of the government 's ability to maintain security			1
here 's how things got to this point			2
so , what happened ? monday night into tuesday , militants seized @entity8 's airport , its tv stations and the governor 's office			2
they freed up to 1,000 prisoners			0
police and soldiers ran from their posts rather than put up a fight , abandoning their weapons as they went			0
the militants took their place in the city 's boulevards and buildings			2
" there was no presence of any government forces on the streets , the majority of their posts destroyed and manned by ( @entity46 militants ) , " resident @entity38 said			0
an audio recording purportedly from the @entity48 in @entity0 and @entity49 promises more fighting in more @entity0 cities , including @entity52			1
" continue your march as the battle is not yet raging , " a voice said to be that of @entity56 spokesman @entity55 says			0
why is this significant ? @entity8 is the nation 's second - largest city			0
what 's happening here does n't bode well for prime minister @entity65 's administration			0
it calls into question whether he has a handle on the country			0
the devastating militant advance , which had been building for some time , is proving an object lesson of much that is wrong in @entity0 and the region -- growing sectarian tensions at home and a festering civil war over the border in @entity49			1
it also shows that the extremists are seeking to extend their influence and can strike swiftly and effectively against @entity0 's @entity83 - trained security forces			1
who are the militants ? they 're part of the @entity48 in @entity0 and @entity49 , or @entity56 , an @entity87 splinter group			1
here 's how extreme the militant group is : even @entity87 has disowned it			1
the @entity8 siege has made isis the single most dangerous , destabilizing radical group in the region			0
the group is also known by some as the @entity56			0
its members include @entity97 as well as @entity98 , @entity99 and many fighters from other @entity102 countries , some attracted by the conflict in @entity49			1
how to respond to the @entity56 threat what do they want ? they want to establish an @entity56 caliphate , or state , stretching across the region			0
@entity56 has begun imposing @entity112 law in @entity49 towns it controls , like @entity114 , forcing women to wear the full veil , or niqab , in public and banning music			1
have they made such incursions before ? yes			0
in past months , they 've wrested control of @entity0 cities like @entity123 and parts of @entity125 from authorities , just as they 've done with @entity49 towns over the border			1
militants believed to be from @entity56 have also taken control of two villages in @entity0 's @entity134 province and seized parts of the oil town of @entity137 in @entity139 province , authorities said			1
have they been able to keep their control ? not really			0
despite the territorial advances it has made in @entity147 - dominated @entity145 and @entity146 provinces , @entity56 still has " significant weaknesses , " a @entity83 counterterrorism official says			0
" it has shown little ability to govern effectively , is generally unpopular , and has no sway outside the @entity147 community in either @entity0 or @entity49			1
" how is all this tied to @entity49 ? @entity56 grew out of @entity87 in @entity0			1
in the west of @entity0 , its militants were responsible for killing and maiming many @entity83 troops			2
in 2006 , their commander -- the bloodthirsty @entity156 -- was killed in a @entity83 strike			0
in the years afterward , with @entity83 help , @entity0 tribal militias put the @entity87 upstart on the defensive			1
but when @entity83 troops left , the extremist militants found new leadership , went to @entity49 , grew stronger and returned to @entity0 , making military gains often off the backs of the foreign fighters drawn to @entity49 's conflict			1
now the group has footholds in both countries and is blamed for destabilizing both			0
in @entity49 , where its forces have clashed with other @entity46 groups , observers say the internecine fighting has played into the hands of @entity178 's regime by distracting rival factions from their campaign against the @entity49 military			1
what 's the situation in @entity8 right now ? more than 500,000 civilians have fled since the fighting started over the weekend , according to the @entity186			2
the northern city 's four main hospitals are inaccessible because of fighting , and some mosques have been converted to clinics , the @entity186 said			0
there 's a lack of drinking water in the western part of the city since the main water station for the area has been destroyed by bombing			0
food is running low and few areas are receiving electricity , while fuel for generators is also running out			0
what does this mean for @entity0 ? while @entity0 is plagued by multiple daily car bombings and suicide attacks , the sheer scale of the attack on @entity8 -- and the brewing humanitarian crisis tied to it -- bodes ill for the country 's stability			1
according to the @entity214 , last year was @entity0 's most violent in five years , with more than 8,800 people killed , most of them civilians			1
already this year , almost half a million people have been displaced from their homes in central @entity145 province by fighting between the same extremist group and government forces			1
one major reason @entity8 made headlines is how swiftly the city , to all intents and purposes , fell			0
what does this mean for the @entity83 and the @entity229 ? the last @entity83 military forces left @entity0 at the end of 2011 , after nearly nine years of deadly and divisive war in the country			2
talks that might have allowed a continued major military presence broke down amid disputes about whether @entity83 troops would be immune to prosecution by @entity0 authorities			2
@entity0 's security forces , trained by the @entity83 at a cost of billions of dollars , have proved unable to dislodge the militants from strongholds in @entity145 province and have now been routed in @entity8			1
the result seems likely to be continued or growing instability in @entity0 and the wider region			2
@entity250 , at a time when the global economy is recovering , could have an unwelcome impact on oil markets			0
there 's also concern that foreign fighters with @entity56 may go back to their native countries , in @entity97 and elsewhere , and carry out terror attacks there			0
that worry was heightened last month by the shooting deaths of four people at a @entity261 in @entity262 ; the suspect , according to @entity265 officials , recently spent a year in @entity49 and is a radicalized @entity46 .			2

as many as half a million civilians have been forced from their homes
the advance is proving an object lesson of much that 's wrong in @entity0
the @entity48 in @entity0 and @entity49 is so extreme that even @entity87 has *disavowed* it
