@entity0 -- the growing outcry over how the @entity3 and commissioner @entity4 deal with incidents of domestic violence has reached the nation 's highest office			1
even president @entity9 has seen the footage of @entity11 running back @entity12 punching his then - fiancee			1
" the president was shocked by what he saw			1
let 's put it that way , " @entity16 chief of staff @entity15 said told @entity18 's " @entity17 " on sunday			1
the incident involving @entity12 is one of several high - profile scandals involving @entity3 players that have spurred complaints that the @entity3 is too lenient on players			1
a few months after the @entity12 incident , @entity4 suspended him without pay and fined him an additional game check			0
however , after the @entity33 video so clearly showed the forceful nature of the punch , @entity4 suspended @entity12 indefinitely			1
last week , the @entity16 addressed the suspension with a statement saying the president believes domestic violence " contemptible and unacceptable in a civilized society , " but it was n't clear whether he had seen the video of the incident from inside the elevator			1
@entity15 said the @entity16 would n't at this point try to characterize how the @entity3 is handling the @entity12 case			1
but he did speak generally about @entity12 's indefinite suspension			2
" we all know that @entity12 being suspended indefinitely seems to be exactly the right thing , " @entity15 said			0
other lawmakers sunday were far more critical of @entity4 and the league			1
" i have a feeling there 's a lot of people that know stuff , what went on here , " @entity52 sen. @entity51 of @entity53 told @entity1 's " @entity61			2
" " i 'm waiting to see if there is a major cover - up , if it shows [ @entity4 ] lies , there could be many factual situations where , in fact , he should step down			1
" @entity51 , a former prosecutor , is one of 16 female senators who sent a letter to @entity4 calling on the football league to institute a " real zero - tolerance policy " in such cases			1
the @entity3 announced late wednesday that former fbi director @entity73 will lead an independent inquiry into the league 's investigation and how it gathered evidence in the case			1
" @entity73 's integrity is on the line here , and hopefully he 'll get the facts out , " @entity51 said of the investigation			2
" the fact that ( the @entity3 ) gave only a two - game suspension and then turn around and after the evidence goes public say , ' oh , oh , we made a mistake			1
now we 're going to let him go			0
' i think that 's problematic for the @entity3 and deeply concerning about how they handle these kinds of cases			1
" sen. @entity95 of @entity96 , who also signed the letter to @entity4 , had scathing words for the @entity3			1
" i think the way the @entity3 handled this was awful			1
it was outrageous , " @entity95 told @entity103 's " @entity102			2
" " they had all the facts they needed			0
they had a player who admitted to beating his wife			0
they had video of him dragging her out an elevator			2
there was nothing left to determine			0
that player should 've been fired immediately			0
so we are now looking to the commissioner to enforce a zero - tolerance policy			1
" @entity95 also said that if @entity4 has covered up what he knew about the @entity12 incident , he should be benched			0
" initially , i want him to lead the reform to actually create and enforce a zero - tolerance policy			2
but , given the recent debate , you know , if he lied , if he lied to the @entity129 people , then he has to step down , " she said , " because he wo n't have the force of authority to change how they address these issues			0
" @entity95 said the bipartisan letter from lawmakers to @entity4 may be merely the beginning of a broader congressional push for more accountability in the @entity3			1
" if the @entity3 does n't police themselves , then , you know , we will be looking more into it , " she said			1
" i would n't be surprised if we have hearings			0
" sen. @entity144 , @entity145 , recently told @entity1 that he would not " rule out " congressional action to force the @entity3 's hand on domestic abuse			1
in the past , members of @entity150 have leveraged their titles and hearing rooms to press major @entity129 sports leagues to face difficult issues			2
in 2007 , the @entity155 released the landmark @entity156 on steroid use in @entity159			0
household names such as @entity161 and @entity162 were named , and @entity159 commissioner @entity163 responded that the report was a " a call to action , and i will act			2
" baseball fans would eventually see both @entity163 and @entity161 , along with baseball titans @entity167 , @entity169 , @entity170 and @entity171 , testify before @entity150			0
outcry over the @entity3 's response to the @entity12 incident has been compounded by two more recent incidents of domestic violence allegedly involving @entity3 players			1
@entity178 of the @entity179 was indicted last week by a grand jury in @entity181 on a child abuse charge			0
shortly afterward , he was placed on the inactive list for his team			0
the @entity185 placed defensive end @entity186 on the team 's inactive list in a surprise announcement sunday , months after he was convicted of a domestic violence charge			2
authorities say @entity186 choked his then - girlfriend , threw her around , dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her			2
@entity186 -- 6 - foot - 4 and 275 pounds -- says he is innocent , and he has appealed a july guilty verdict rendered by a @entity196 judge in @entity197			2
beyond the @entity200 , @entity199 's second most powerful government official has called on the @entity201 to bench one of its own players involved in a domestic violence investigation			0
@entity205 , a starting defensive end , was arrested on felony domestic violence charges last month			0
" the 49ers ' continued insistence on playing @entity205 during his ongoing criminal investigation is a painful affront to every victim of domestic violence and sends a troubling message to our community , " lt. gov. @entity207 and his wife said in a statement			0
" we strongly urge the 49er organization we grew up revering to do the right thing -- right now -- and bench @entity205 , pending the outcome of his felony domestic violence investigation by @entity225 law enforcement			0
" @entity205 told @entity1 affiliate @entity226 last month that he could n't say much about what happened			0
" the truth will come out , " he said			0
" everybody knows what kind of person i am ... a good - hearted person			0
" @entity1 's @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			0
