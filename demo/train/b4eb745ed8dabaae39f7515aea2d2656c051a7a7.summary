-- the designs painted on planes help distinguish one airline from another , using colors that promote and represent the brands			1
but with frequent mergers and acquisitions in the industry over recent years , traffic in and out of paint shops has increased to keep planes updated with new airline identities			1
the latest to emerge from a respray , covering the remnants of bankruptcy , is @entity17			1
@entity18 and @entity17 will form the largest airline in the world by passenger numbers , worth an estimated $ 11 billion			1
the new company will retain the @entity17 name , but it will have up to 73 aircraft repainted by the end of this year to reflect its new branding			1
the former look of its planes features a silver , bare - metal finish with a red , white and blue stripe running along the body , its iconic logo of an eagle and double a adorning the tailfins			1
the new design covers the planes in silver paint and puts stripes on the tail			1
" it brings @entity47 into the @entity49 age with its nice reflective coating , " says @entity42 , a strategist with @entity44 , and airline management consulting firm			0
" i think where there are challenges are perhaps some of the brand mark elements that have been left behind , which have been around for 40 years , " @entity42 says , referring to the airline 's logo , which has been radically changed			1
in recent years , the six major @entity47 carriers have consolidated into three			0
@entity58 was completely absorbed when it merged with @entity59 in 2008			1
two years later , @entity60 merged with @entity61			2
with each merger , airlines must choose carefully which parts of brands to hold onto			1
in the case of @entity60 and @entity61 , the newly formed company kept @entity60 's distinctive logo of a yellow globe			2
" they did a very sensible thing , actually			0
they retained the @entity61 name -- the more recognized name worldwide -- with the @entity60 logo , " says @entity72 , the ceo of @entity73 , the parent company of @entity74			2
" and i think that was meant to bring the @entity60 people into the business			0
there 's a sense of inclusiveness , which i think was a smart move			0
" there are instances of companies getting the rebranding wrong , @entity90 says , like the unpopular tailfin designs on @entity74 planes in the late 1990s			0
" but out of that came something fantastic : the @entity97 flag , the livery that we have on our aircraft today , " he says			0
acquisitions and the new coats of paint that often follow have been cropping up across @entity104 , too			2
after @entity73 bought the airline @entity106 from @entity107 last year , dozens of @entity106 's planes needed to be repainted to reflect its new branding , a process that used around 750 liters of spray paint per plane			1
meanwhile , @entity107 is getting ready to relaunch @entity112 , a low - cost airline that it acquired in 2009			0
part of the preparations involves repainting the fleet in the new @entity112 livery , which incorporates colors that signify @entity107 's ownership			2
" we decided we needed a fresh approach			0
and what you see in our new livery is @entity107 's yellow colors and our raspberry colors , " says @entity122 , the ceo of @entity112			0
and passengers can expect more fresh paint jobs ahead , as the flailing airline industry continues to see mergers as a way to strengthen businesses			0
" it happens on a slow - drip basis , " @entity90 said , " but i think we 'll see more consolidation , and i think the industry recognizes that it is a positive development			0

consolidation of airlines has led to name and logo changes
