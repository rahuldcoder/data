-- they are tall , powerful and capable of serving a tennis ball at over 150 mph ( 241 kph )			1
they are the rocket men of tennis , and they 're getting faster			2
leading the race is @entity6 , the 6 ft 10 in @entity7 they call the " @entity9 , " who was clocked at 156 mph ( 251 kph ) during a @entity12 tie in @entity13 last month			1
the 32 - year - old 's world record is unlikely to go unchallenged for long			1
@entity15 has twice hit the 155 mph ( 249 kph ) mark , and 20 - year - old @entity18 @entity17 is already firing at 153 mph ( 246 kph )			1
but as serves continue to get faster , tennis is staring down a difficult problem -- what to do when rallies become a rarity , and every other point is an ace			2
" players like @entity17 and @entity6 combine great technique with height and long arms to generate racket speed , " said former @entity28 champion @entity27 , of @entity0 's @entity29			1
" it seems the only way to slow the serves down is to limit the size of players , cut some of their arms off , or make them stand in a hole			0
" but there may be an alternative			0
in 2002 , the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) included a new , larger tennis ball in its official rules			1
while its primary purpose is for recreational players and use at high altitude , the @entity48 ball is also intended to " help curb where necessary the dominance of the serve and corresponding lack of rallies in the professional game			0
" the graphic above demonstrates how			0
the 6 % increase in diameter means the ball travels more slowly due to greater drag , and also bounces higher			1
put simply , it makes the game easier			0
" that 's why we 've got them			0
we 're waiting in the wings for a time when there are too many aces in professional tournaments , " said @entity68 , @entity69 at the @entity44			1
" for the moment our research suggests reaction times are keeping up with the increases in serve speed , because the number of aces has not really increased since 2002			1
but when we see evidence that aces are going up , that 's when the bigger balls will come into play			1
" @entity44 research suggests it 's a matter of when , and not if			1
the mean average of men 's serving speed in the four grand slams rose from 130 mph ( 209 kph ) to 137 mph ( 221 kph ) , between 2002 and 2010			1
the world record stood at @entity92 's mark of 149 mph ( 240 kph ) in 2001			1
just 10 years later , and the 160 mph ( 257 kph ) barrier is very much within reach			2
bigger , stronger players , along with advancements in racket technology , are pushing the envelope			0
but if the rocket men keep serving faster , they might not like what 's coming next			0
" the @entity102 seniors used those bigger balls for a couple of years , and they were soundly voted down			2
not one player like them , " @entity27 said			0
" it was impossible to hit a winning volley and the ball dipped severely -- making it easier to keep the ball in court			0
" introducing them would be a move in the wrong direction			0
@entity116 is becoming like a video game as it is , with the lack of variety on the shot - making front			0
taking the volley out of the game with larger balls will ruin the game			0
bring your caffeine pills to keep you awake			0
" @entity68 admits the bigger balls wo n't be to everyone 's liking : " players will feel like they have to hit the ball harder to gain the same power with their shots , and some of our research suggests they could tire more easily			2
" when the alternative could be a sport where the giant serve is all - powerful , and matches could effectively be over in half the time , the @entity44 may be left with little choice			2
reaction times have a ceiling , and when that 's reached a glut of aces will likely prompt the @entity44 to act			1
forget " new balls , please " -- the call for the next generation could well be , " bigger balls , please			2

@entity6 broke the world record for the fastest serve in a @entity12 match in march
the @entity154 was clocked at 155 mph ( 251 kph ) to beat @entity15 's previous mark
type 3 tennis balls were introduced by the @entity44 in 2002 , and are 6 % bigger in diameter
they are seen as a potential *solution* if the number of aces begins to increase
