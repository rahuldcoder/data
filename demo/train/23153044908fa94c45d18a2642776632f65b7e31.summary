@entity0 , @entity1 -- three men have been sent to prison for the acid attack that nearly blinded @entity6			1
but the artistic director of the @entity8 says that nothing can give him back what he has lost			0
in an exclusive interview with @entity2 in @entity0 , @entity1 , on the day his attackers were sentenced in a @entity14 court , @entity6 said the attack had dented his spirit as well as leaving him in agony and partially disfigured			1
" it 's not just a problem with my eyes , it 's a problem with my heart , " he said			1
@entity6 now wears dark glasses much of the time and has undergone numerous surgeries in @entity1 since the attack in a @entity14 street last january			1
and he bears the pain of knowing that it was one of the dancers in his own world - renowned company who masterminded the attack , star soloist @entity35			1
@entity35 was sent to prison for six years tuesday , while accomplice @entity37 was sentenced to 10 years and driver @entity38 got four years			0
@entity6 said he accepts the court 's verdict and sentencing -- but he is not prepared to forgive and forget			1
" of course not , i can not forgive them because there is no sentence nor punishment today that would enable me to recover my eyesight , the eyesight that i once had , " he said			2
" what will happen in the course of my future treatment , nobody knows			0
whatever is ahead , it will be a struggle			0
" so far doctors have managed to restore some of @entity6 's vision , but his sight remains impaired			1
' it hurt all over my skin ' as a dancer , @entity6 was one of @entity62 's brightest stars			1
now 43 , he took up the key role of artistic director at the storied @entity8 in 2011 , after three years directing @entity14 's @entity66 and @entity65 , amid what was reported to be fierce rivalry			2
he won the position but his artistic leadership of @entity62 's most prominent cultural icon has been marred by scandal , not least the horrific attack he suffered outside his @entity14 home			1
@entity6 recalls what happened on that fateful january day , when a masked assailant tossed sulfuric acid into his face			2
" what i felt was unbearable agony			0
it hurt all over my skin and i immediately felt an atrocious pain in my eyes , " he said			1
" there was lots of snow around and i slid and fell several times			0
but i felt the cold snow was relieving the pain , so i started covering my face with it			2
" he was eventually helped by passersby			0
but the damage was already done -- and the next time he was seen in public , it was with his head swathed in bandages and third - degree burns to his face and eyes			0
when it emerged that @entity35 was behind the attack , the dark rivalries and score - settling at the heart of the @entity8 were laid bare , amid allegations of affairs , corruption and jealousy			2
@entity6 does not believe that different actions on his part might have resulted in a different outcome			2
" those accusations that we have heard have not been underpinned by any evidence , " he said			0
" they are all lies aimed at lessening the degree of guilt or punishment for this crime			0
" @entity2 's @entity119 reported from @entity0 and @entity120 wrote in @entity121 .			0
