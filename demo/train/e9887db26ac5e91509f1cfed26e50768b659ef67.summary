@entity0 -- @entity3 presidential candidate @entity2 faced a new claim of sexually inappropriate behavior monday as a @entity7 woman told reporters the former head of the @entity10 groped her after a dinner together in 1997			1
@entity12 , who worked at the restaurant group 's education foundation until shortly before the alleged groping incident , said @entity2 unexpectedly put his hand on her leg beneath her skirt " toward my genitals			1
" she also said he pushed her head toward his crotch			0
@entity2 stopped when she protested , @entity12 told a news conference			1
looking into the television cameras , @entity12 said : " i want you , mr. @entity2 , to come clean			1
just admit what you did			0
" @entity26 a girl 's best friend the accusation follows the disclosure last week that the restaurant association provided payments to two women who left the group after alleging sexual harassment by @entity2 , also in the late 1990s			1
@entity2 has denied all accusations of sexual harassment , and his campaign put out a fresh denial after @entity12 made her accusations on monday			1
" all allegations of harassment against mr. @entity2 are completely false , " a campaign statement said			1
" mr. @entity2 has never harassed anyone			2
" earlier accuser 's attorney talks to @entity1 since becoming public on october 30 in a report by @entity48 , the sexual harassment accusations have overwhelmed the bid by the former pizza company executive to win the @entity3 presidential nomination			1
@entity2 , a favorite of tea party conservatives , has risen to the top of the polls following strong performances in several debates and the release of his " 9 - 9 - 9 " tax plan that sets flat 9 % rates for corporate and income taxes and also creates a 9 % national sales tax			2
however , @entity12 's accusation raises fresh questions about whether @entity2 has been candid about the allegations that he sexually harassed women at the restaurant association when he headed the group from 1996 - 99			1
@entity12 said she started to work at the group 's foundation in 1996 but was laid off in 1997			1
the association confirmed @entity12 's employment dates as december 30 , 1996 , to june 20 , 1997			1
shortly after getting let go , @entity12 said , she contacted @entity2 -- whom she had met at the group 's @entity7 convention -- to seek help in finding a job			1
she traveled to @entity0 , where @entity2 worked , and found he had upgraded her hotel room to a luxury suite without telling her			2
they had dinner at an @entity82 restaurant , she said , and then @entity2 asked if she had been to the association offices in the capital			2
@entity2 made his advances on the way , according to @entity12			1
" he said , ' you want a job , right ? ' " she told reporters at the news conference organized by celebrity attorney @entity26			0
@entity12 took no questions from reporters , but @entity26 said @entity12 had told two people at the time about what happened			0
@entity12 filed no complaint with the restaurant association because she no longer worked there , @entity26 said			0
asked why @entity12 was coming forward now , @entity26 said it was in solidarity with @entity2 's other accusers and harassed women everywhere			1
@entity2 has previously complained the sexual harassment allegations amount to a baseless media onslaught against his campaign			1
polls have yet to indicate any significant effect on his support -- in fact , the campaign reported a spike in donations monday			0
cain spokesman @entity113 told @entity1 the campaign raked in $ 2 million during the past week			1
by comparison , @entity2 raised $ 2.8 million between june and october			2
on sunday , one of @entity2 's rivals called for keeping the issue alive , saying the necessary scrutiny of presidential candidates requires @entity2 to answer all questions about what happened			1
on saturday , @entity2 scolded reporters who asked about the issue following a debate with fellow conservative @entity125 in @entity127			0
" do n't even go there , " @entity2 told one questioner who 'd asked about the allegations			2
asked again later , he responded : " what i 'm saying is this -- we are getting back on message , end of story			0
read all of the other accounts , where everything has been answered -- end of story			0
" on friday , a lawyer for one of the accusers reported by @entity48 released a statement saying she stood by her claims against @entity2			0
however , the woman has so far refused to allow her identity or specifics of her allegations to be made public			2
in response to the new allegation monday , the attorney , @entity147 , said he believes it corroborates his client 's story and called it " similar conduct by the same person			0
" he refused to provide further details			0
@entity2 supporters have said the anonymous allegations and lack of details showed the political nature of the accusations reported by @entity48			2
@entity12 is the first woman to publicly accuse @entity2 and provide specifics about what allegedly happened			1
" it 's up to @entity2 to get the information out and get it out in total , " @entity163 , the former @entity164 governor running far behind @entity2 in polls so far , told @entity167 's " @entity168 " program			2
" that 's important because we 've got some real issues to discuss in this campaign , and this is taking all the bandwidth out of the discussion			0
so we 're not able to talk about jobs			0
we 're not able to talk about our position in the world			0
" conservatives , angered by the media attention to the potentially fatal accusations for the @entity188 favorite 's campaign , argued that the lack of specifics -- with no public disclosure yet of an accuser 's name or specific offense alleged -- showed it was all more circus than substance			2
legitimate issue or political drama ? " until something comes out that 's concrete , i think it is politics as usual , " retiring sen. @entity203 , @entity204 , told @entity1 's " @entity205			0
" to rep. @entity206 , a @entity207 @entity3 backing former @entity209 gov. @entity208 in the @entity3 race , @entity2 is undergoing a difficult transition from private business figure to public politician			0
" to go directly from being a businessman , without substantial time in the government arena , both the vetting and the knowledge of it , is really hard , " @entity206 told @entity167			0
" it 's virtually impossible " and in @entity2 's presidential quest , may be " a bridge too far			1
" former @entity223 gov. @entity222 , a strong @entity225 voice , suggested @entity2 's troubles were only part of the problem for @entity3 on women 's issues			1
" i think what you 're seeing is a huge assault on women 's rights in the @entity3 parties , and an extreme right - wing that has taken over that is going to make it very difficult for anybody in a general election in the @entity3 to be a centrist , " @entity222 said on @entity167			0
@entity1 's @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0
