-- for some , @entity1 is a social media platform that enables you to keep up with breaking news , raise political issues or offer amusing thoughts			1
but for many others , including myself , @entity1 has become the new " @entity9			1
" it has in essence become the cyber version of the basement of " @entity13 " from that 1999 classic film			0
to those who have not made it onto @entity1 yet , let 's make something clear : @entity1 is not @entity19			1
@entity19 is as dangerous as visiting a @entity20 's			2
@entity1 , on the other hand , is the @entity22 in the 1800s -- it 's new , unsettled and often savage			1
in " @entity9 , " people from all walks of life -- from professionals to blue collar workers -- would nightly shrug off their mundane existence to experience a visceral rush by beating the crap out of each other in the basement of a neighborhood bar			0
" @entity9 " celebrated the duality of life			0
by day , actor @entity37 played a mild - mannered , timid insurance adjuster leading the quintessential life " of quiet desperation			0
" but by night , @entity37 became his brash and bold alter ego , @entity9 , portrayed by @entity42			0
the difference between these two characters was succinctly summed up by @entity9 while talking to his more staid alter ego : " i am free in all the ways that you are not			0
" this is what @entity1 is to many			1
a place to be free			0
a place where people from all walks of life are on equal footing to battle each other -- from the rich and powerful to the poor and angry			0
and on @entity1 , you 're not required to be polite like you are in the real world			2
in fact , cutting and snarky remarks are not only accepted , they are glorified			0
but there 's an increasingly dark underbelly to these @entity1 fights			1
what might start out as a disagreement about a political or social issue , at times can escalate into racist , sexist or homophobic rants			1
in fact , @entity70 recently created a map entitled " @entity73 " which charted the hate filled comments being spewed on @entity1			1
i 've experienced it firsthand			0
some i 've fought with on @entity1 have called me ethnic slurs like " towel head " because i 'm of @entity82 heritage or a " stupid guinea " because i 'm also of @entity85 descent			2
but these comments are tame when compared to the far more hateful comments launched on @entity1 against @entity88 , latinos , gays , and the disabled as noted by the @entity93 study			2
i know some reading this are asking : why do you fight at all on @entity1 ? why not just ignore those people who challenge you ? sure , you can do that , but as @entity9 instructively told us in " @entity9 " : " how much can you know about yourself if you 've never been in a fight			1
" so many engage in these battles to test their mettle			0
there 's nothing wrong with the great percentage of @entity1 fights			1
you get a chance to test your opinions on issues of the day			0
in today 's hyperpartisan climate , many just associate with like - minded people and consequently their views on political issues are never challenged			2
but @entity1 provides a forum to debate with others who passionately hold opposing views			2
true , these battles can become heated and include nasty comments , but for the most part they remain issue - oriented and avoid bigotry			0
more than once , i 've engaged in a fiery battle over an issue and then found common ground on an unrelated subject that has led to a @entity1 friendship			2
after one intense argument with a conservative over president @entity134 's policies , we both discovered our mutual dislike of @entity137 quarterback @entity136			0
( i 'm a @entity138 fan and he 's a @entity140 fan			0
) that 's not to excuse the alarming rise of racist , sexist , homophobic and other hate filled comments on @entity1			1
and while the @entity70 report does n't indicate how many of these comments were made during @entity1 fights , i can assure you that is where i have seen them rear their ugly face most often			1
here 's my plea to my fellow @entity1 users : we need to make it clear that there 's simply no place for that type of hate on @entity1			1
you can win a battle on substance -- or even with cutting remarks --- without descending into the realm of racism and bigotry			0
and the best people to police this are my fellow @entity1 users			1
if enough of us collectively speak out , @entity1 can become a social media platform where users share info , joke around and even fight with each other , but all without being subject to hate			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			2

@entity177 says @entity1 has become a home to sharp *exchanges* , fights
he says the social *network* allows people to release *aggression*
@entity177 : it 's *inexcusable* when people engage in racist , sexist , homophobic rants
he says @entity1 users must unite in declaring there 's no room for hate
