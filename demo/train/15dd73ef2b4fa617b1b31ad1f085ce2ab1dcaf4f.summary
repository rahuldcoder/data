-- a new @entity0 poll confirms that we 're witnessing a quiet reversal in the character of our two major parties			1
traditionally , @entity6 have always coalesced around the conventional wisdom front - runner for president			1
conservatives respect structure , order and party brand names			0
not for nothing was the name @entity15 , @entity16 or @entity17 on the @entity6 presidential ticket from 1952 to 2004			1
in contrast , @entity19 have favored the presidential candidate with the hot hand , rising from obscurity to the @entity24 -- think @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
but a fresh - out - of - the - oven @entity0 presidential poll shows a fractured @entity6 field of newcomers with no clear front - runner while the @entity19 have given an unprecedented lead to a brand name of their own : @entity34			1
opinion : @entity6 strategy on shutdown courts doom yes , it is pathetically early to be projecting on the 2016 presidential campaign			1
predictive capacity hovers somewhere near zero , and time fixated on polls would be productively used thinking about the 2014 midterms or the fights over the debt ceiling looming over our divided , dysfunctional @entity47			0
but as a snapshot of the underlying dynamics driving the two parties , this new poll is worth a look			2
on the @entity6 side of the aisle , @entity55 gov. @entity54 narrowly leads the fractured field at 17 % , one point above rep. @entity60 , best known as @entity62 's vice presidential running mate			1
in the old days , the previous vice presidential nominee would be the future favorite			0
but that does n't seem to be the case for @entity60 , who emerged from the 2012 presidential race arguably damaged by his association with the @entity62 campaign			0
traditionally , the governor of blue state @entity55 would n't be on the @entity6 radar at all , but @entity54 -- cruising to a landslide re-election -- seems to be the exception to this and other rules			1
next on the list is @entity77 , the scion of an outsider libertarian movement sparked by his dad 's multiple runs for president			0
but the compelling and controversial one - time eye doctor is a first - term senator from @entity84 , far from your typical presidential timber			2
perhaps most interesting is the second tier of @entity6 candidates			1
@entity16 seems settled in at 10 % , despite brand name and legendary brand loyalty			0
two @entity93 senate @entity6 , @entity90 and @entity91 , come in next at 9 % and 7 % respectively			2
and then , at the bottom of the barrel , come two 2012 aspirants : @entity98 gov. @entity97 and former @entity100 sen. @entity99			0
far from being strengthened by their 2012 campaigns , these two candidates seem weakened by the experience			0
@entity97 's " oops " heard round the world still resonates while @entity99 's strident social conservatism does n't seem to be taken seriously by 95 % of the party faithful			0
@entity27 pressures conservative @entity6 over possible shutdown the real news is on the @entity19 side			1
@entity34 has accumulated a towering 55 percentage point lead over her next closest competitor , vice president @entity114 , who is at 10 % and does n't exactly lack name recognition			2
below @entity114 are first - term @entity117 sen. @entity116 at 7 % , @entity119 gov. @entity118 at 6 % and @entity121 gov. @entity120 -- perhaps the most openly ambitious of the bunch -- at 2 %			0
@entity26 's dominance illustrates an interesting dynamic			2
six years ago , she was a far more polarizing figure among @entity19 ( and independents )			0
today , after her service as secretary of state , she seems more qualified and less polarizing , transcending her association with the culture of wars concurrent with @entity26 's two terms in office			0
tough and experienced , @entity26 is now positioned as a candidate who rivals @entity27 's 2007 surge			2
she will also be positioned as the candidate of the 51 % , compelling to women of all ages and even possibly competitive among @entity6 women in this incarnation			2
@entity142 is well liked by the rank and file , but there does n't seem to be much of a stampede to put him on the top of the ticket			0
@entity151 's strength comes from fascination with the new and represents the growing strength of the liberal base in the party			0
and while successful governors like @entity118 and @entity120 have earned the right to be taken seriously as presidential candidates , the party faithful do n't seem to be much interested in buying what they are selling at the moment			1
if @entity26 does not run for some reason , @entity19 will quickly wake up to the awkward fact that they have almost no depth of the bench after two @entity27 terms			1
so there you have it : @entity19 are behaving like @entity6 , falling in line behind the big brand name dominating a race that is still three years away			1
and @entity6 are behaving like @entity19 , putting forward a fractured field with no clear front - runners but elevating a @entity55 governor , a @entity179 congressman and a @entity84 senator to the front of the pack			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

@entity185 : a new @entity0 poll shows a reversal in the character of two major parties
@entity185 : traditionally , @entity6 coalesce around a front - runner ; @entity19 root for newcomers
now , @entity6 has an *eclectic* pool of presidential candidates ; @entity19 have @entity34
@entity185 : if @entity26 does not run , @entity19 will have almost no strong candidate
