@entity0 , @entity1 -- deliberations were suspended for the night thursday in the court - martial of the @entity6 psychiatrist charged with massacring soldiers at @entity0			1
the jury will continue weighing the fate friday morning of maj. @entity10 , who is charged with 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder in the november 5 , 2009 , shooting rampage			1
the only real question likely facing the jury is @entity10 's degree of guilt , given that he told the court during opening arguments that the evidence would clearly show he was the shooter			1
@entity24 reconvened briefly thursday evening after the jury said it had two questions			1
jurors asked to have police officer @entity29 's testimony read back to them and asked to see a map of buildings at @entity0			1
the jury of 13 military officers began deliberations after @entity10 declined to make a statement during closing arguments			1
the prosecution urged the jury to convict , saying the evidence showed he believed he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible			0
" the defense chooses not to make a closing statement , " @entity10 told the court , refusing to challenge any of the evidence presented during 13 days of testimony in the court - martial			1
if the jury of 13 senior officers unanimously convicts @entity10 of two or more counts of premeditated murder , he faces a possible death sentence in the penalty phase			1
" there is no doubt , as i said in the beginning , the accused is the shooter , " the prosecutor , col. @entity54 , told the jury			0
" the only question for you is ... is this a premeditated design to kill ? " for more than 90 minutes , the prosecutor took the jury methodically through the evidence in the case , meticulously piecing together how they say @entity10 prepared and planned for an attack at a deployment processing center for soldiers deploying to @entity69 and @entity70			1
prosecutors have maintained the @entity73 - born @entity72 underwent a progressive radicalization that led to the massacre at the sprawling central @entity1 base			0
" he did not want to deploy , and he came to believe he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible , " @entity54 told the jury			0
@entity10 picked the day -- november 5 , 2009 -- because it was when the units he was scheduled to deploy with to @entity69 were scheduled to go through the processing center , he said			1
@entity10 , who has been acting as his own attorney , rested his case without calling a single witness or taking the stand to testify on his own behalf			1
his decision not to offer a defense was an anticlimactic end to the trial in which prosecution witnesses , primarily survivors , painted a horrific picture of what unfolded inside a processing center during the attack			0
during closing arguments , prosecutors showed a graphic @entity100 video of the crime scene hours after the rampage , where bodies , blood and bullets still covered the floor			0
as the video was shown to the jury , some of the family members of those killed fought back tears			0
one woman laid her head on her husband 's shoulder , tears pouring down her cheeks , while another woman -- a wife of a victim -- left the courtroom			0
for his part , @entity10 watched the video , appearing to pay close attention			2
@entity10 , who has insisted that the jury not be allowed to consider lesser charges against him , said his attack on soldiers at @entity0 was not an act of " sudden passion			1
" there was " adequate provocation " for the attack because the soldiers were going to participate in " an illegal war " in @entity69 , @entity10 told the military judge wednesday , arguing against the jury being allowed to consider voluntary manslaughter or unpremeditated murder			1
prosecutors argued against the inclusion of lesser charges , saying the attack was n't carried out in " the heat of sudden passion , " and @entity10 said he agreed			2
@entity10 rests case , calls no witnesses much has been made of @entity10 's defense or , as his stand - by attorneys have said , the lack of it			2
judge @entity148 declined a request by @entity10 's attorneys to drop out of the case			2
the attorneys argued that @entity10 was helping the prosecution put him to death			2
there may be something to that claim			0
@entity10 took credit for the shooting rampage at the outset of the trial , telling the jury during opening statements that the evidence will show " i was the shooter			1
" the judge barred @entity10 from pleading guilty at the start of the court - martial			1
under military law , defendants can not enter guilty pleas in capital punishment cases			0
@entity148 has refused to allow @entity10 to argue " defense of others , " a claim that he carried out the shootings to protect the @entity69 @entity174 and its leaders from @entity73 soldiers			2
@entity10 challenges witness account of shooting perhaps as a way around that ruling , @entity10 in recent days has leaked documents through his civilian attorney to the @entity185 and @entity186 that offer a glimpse of his justification for carrying out the attack			2
among the documents was a mental health evaluation conducted by a military panel to determine whether @entity10 was fit to stand trial			2
" i do n't think what i did was wrong because it was for the greater cause of helping my @entity72 brothers , " he told the panel , according to pages of the report published by @entity185			0
he also said , according to the documents : " i 'm paraplegic and could be in jail for the rest of my life			0
however , if i died by lethal injection , i would still be a martyr			0
" military prosecutors called 89 witnesses and submitted more than 700 pieces of evidence before resting their case , hoping to show that the @entity73 - born @entity72 had undergone what they described as a progressive radicalization			0
they have argued to the jury that @entity10 , who was scheduled to deploy to @entity69 , did not want to fight other @entity72 and believed he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible			1
the judge excluded much of the evidence that the prosecution contends goes to the heart of the motive for the attack , including e-mail communications between @entity10 and @entity223 , the @entity73 - born cleric who officials say became a key member of @entity226			2
he was killed in a @entity73 drone strike in 2011			0
she also declined to allow prosecutors to use materials they maintain showed @entity10 's interest in the actions of @entity6 sgt. @entity233 , the @entity73 soldier sentenced to death for killing two soldiers and wounding more than a dozen others at the start of the @entity70 war , an attack he said he carried out to stop soldiers from killing @entity72			1
along with the e-mails and the material related to @entity233 , @entity148 also declined to allow the use of @entity10 's academic presentation on suicide bombings , saying " motive is not an element of the crime			0
" the final witness called by the prosecution , dr. @entity249 , testified tuesday about what @entity10 told her would happen to the @entity6 if he were deployed			1
" the last thing he said ... ' they will pay , ' " @entity249 said			0
@entity10 's defense strategy martyrdom ? @entity2 's @entity255 and @entity256 contributed to this report .			0
