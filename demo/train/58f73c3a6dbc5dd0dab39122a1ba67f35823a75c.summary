-- the @entity1 has nationalised @entity2 , the fourth - largest systemically important bank in the @entity1 , at a cost to @entity1 taxpayers of € 3.7bn			1
the bank had spent the past several weeks in a desperate search for private capital to compensate for heavy losses in its real estate holdings , particularly in @entity11 assets			0
@entity12 , the @entity1 ' finance minister , said in a statement he had " looked at every alternative involving private parties " , but found none that could guarantee the stability of the @entity1 banking system			1
with @entity20 still in government hands after it was nationalised in 2009 , the nationalisation of @entity2 means two of the @entity1 ' four systemically important banks are state - owned			2
the nationalisation , carried out under the @entity1 ' 2012 law on bank intervention , will mean shareholders of the bank and subordinated debt holders will see their stakes wiped out			2
the state will inject € 2.2bn in new capital , while forgiving € 800m the bank still owed from its earlier bailout during the financial crisis			1
it will also write off € 700m in the value of the bank 's real estate assets			1
" i can sympathise easily with the resistance many will feel because we again will need to use a large amount of public money , " mr @entity12 said			0
" this is why i want the private sector to pay as large a share as possible of the rescue of @entity2			0
" in addition , the government will levy a one - time tariff of € 1bn on @entity1 banks in 2014 as a contribution to restoring the health of the financial sector			2
" politically speaking , that 's very important , " said @entity55 , a professor of finance at @entity57			0
@entity59 , @entity2 's chief executive , as well as the bank 's chief financial officer and chairman of the board of directors , tendered their resignations			1
@entity2 announced they " could not take responsibility for the nationalisation scenario "			0
the finance ministry said the bank 's management would receive no bonuses , and that salary cuts were to be expected			1
the nationalisation comes after the @entity72 blocked an earlier plan that would have seen the country 's other large banks , @entity74 , @entity76 and @entity20 , contribute capital to a so - called " bad bank " to house @entity2 's distressed property assets			0
in a blogpost on @entity0 on thursday , economist @entity80 noted that rating agency @entity82 has warned it may downgrade the debt of other @entity1 and @entity85 banks if a government rescue of @entity2 wipes out ordinary bondholders .			0
