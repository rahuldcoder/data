-- from the mid- 1980s , @entity3 - born investor and philanthropist @entity1 pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into foundations in @entity5 dedicated to promoting the idea of the " open society " and challenging the region 's @entity9 - backed regimes			1
here , writing exclusively for @entity0 , he describes how the work of his foundations ultimately contributed to the collapse of communism			1
a @entity9 tank rolls through @entity16 during the failed 1956 @entity3 uprising against communist domination			1
i set up my first foundation in @entity3 in 1984			1
the idea behind it was simple			2
the state dogma , promoted by the ruling communists , was false and by providing an alternative we could expose its falsehood			2
accordingly we supported every cultural initiative that was not an expression of the established dogma			2
i was guided by the concept of the " open society , " which i adopted from the philosopher @entity33			2
i saw the open society as a more sophisticated form of social organization than the totalitarian closed societies of the @entity9 bloc			2
the latter were trying to implement central plans ; in an open society every individual or organization was supposed to implement their own plan			2
to make the transition from a closed to an open society would require outside help and that was what my foundations sought to provide			1
in @entity3 the authorities insisted on having a controlling presence on the foundation 's board			1
we eventually agreed to appoint two chief executives , one nominated by them and one by me			2
the project succeeded beyond my expectations			2
with very small amounts of money people could engage in a wide variety of civic initiatives ranging from self - governing student colleges to zither clubs			2
one of our first projects was to offer photocopying machines to cultural and scientific institutions in exchange for local currency			0
we used the money to give out local grants and support all kinds of unofficial initiatives , but the photocopying machines also did a lot of good			0
up until then , the few existing copy machines were literally held under lock and key -- as more and more became available , the @entity76 apparatus lost control of the machines and the dissemination of information			0
we did not have to exercise direct control			0
civil society watched over the foundation			1
for instance , we were warned that a blind association , to whom we gave a grant for talking books , was stealing some of the money			0
with a budget of $ 3 million , the foundation had more influence on the cultural life of @entity3 than the @entity97			1
carried away my success in @entity3 , by 1988 i had set up foundations in @entity101 , @entity102 and the @entity9			1
i think that i could have influenced @entity103 in @entity101 to change his attitude toward the opposition and to see that dissidents such as @entity107 and @entity108 were also patriots despite their criticism of the ruling party			0
as the @entity9 empire collapsed , and eventually the @entity9 and also @entity112 disintegrated , we continued to expand			0
by 1992 there were foundations in 22 countries and expenditure had reached $ 53 million			1
a year later we were spending nearly $ 184 million			0
right at the beginning , i had a disagreement with the @entity101 board about the way the foundation should be run			1
but that taught me a lesson			0
they were right and i was wrong			0
i realized that the people living there understood their country better than i did and i deferred to their judgment			0
it did not always work			0
in @entity133 , a board member who made his name as a human rights activist turned out to be a racist			0
a @entity136 businessman sought to hijack the foundation for nationalist purposes			1
it was the @entity140 foundation that gave us the most trouble ; we had to reorganize it twice			1
but the foundations were the first out of the gate everywhere			1
i remembered the lesson my father who had lived through the @entity148 in @entity149 taught me : in revolutionary times things that are normally impossible become possible			1
in @entity151 , we set up the @entity152 before @entity151 became independent			1
in @entity153 , we persevered with the foundation during the five - year civil war although we had no way of controlling its activities			1
our impact was the greatest during that turbulent period			0
when i set up the foundations in @entity5 i hoped the open societies of the @entity162 would follow in my footsteps , but in that regard i was disappointed			1
unwilling to burden their own budgets , they gave the job to the @entity169 , which was ill suited to the task			0
the @entity169 was accustomed to signing letters of intent with governments , making the continuation of their programs conditional on the governments fulfilling their obligations			0
the countries of @entity5 fared better , but in the former @entity9 states one after another , the programs largely failed			1
@entity182 was the exception : @entity184 was willing to make the sacrifices that were necessary to integrate it			0
eventually , the countries of @entity5 , including the @entity188 , also made the grade when the @entity190 gave them accession			2
but the rest of the @entity193 in the @entity194 and @entity195 never succeeded in making the transition			0
this has left a bitter legacy			0
rightly or wrongly , both the rulers and the people of @entity140 harbor a deep resentment against the @entity162 , which the @entity162 has not come to grips with			1
the new order in @entity204 that has emerged out of the chaos of the 1990s is very far from an open society			0
it is an authoritarian regime that preserves the outward appearances of democracy but derives its power from its control of @entity140 's national resources			1
it uses those resources to maintain itself in power , to personally enrich the rulers , and to exercise influence over its neighborhood , both in @entity5 and in the former @entity9 sphere			0
but the ideal of an open society is difficult to suppress and i have not given up hope .			0
