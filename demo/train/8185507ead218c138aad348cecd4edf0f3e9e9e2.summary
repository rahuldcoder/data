one of the odder , funnier moments of " @entity1 " came recently when two head honchos , @entity3 and @entity4 , duked it out in a conference room			1
the fight lasted only moments , but according to @entity10 , who plays @entity4 , it was one of those rare moments that creator @entity13 had a vision that aligned with what fans had clamored for over the years			1
@entity10 's portrayal of the young go - getter is an excellent study in how to make an audience despise a character			1
he 's slimy and cruel and will step right over you , sometimes even on you , just to climb the corporate ladder			1
and while it 's easy to cast @entity4 as one of " @entity1 " s villains , still , there 's something sympathetic and likeable about him underneath it all			1
@entity30 spoke with @entity10 about staging fights and social change on " @entity1 " and why there 's a little @entity4 in all of us			1
@entity30 : this recent episode featured a fist fight between @entity4 and @entity3			1
does a small part of you wish he knocked @entity3 out ? @entity10 : well , no , not really			1
the reason is , i stopped wishing for things with my character because i 'm very aware that ( creator ) @entity13 has a plan for how this story should go			1
i trust him like i 've never trusted any writer or creator that i 've worked with			2
he knows what the audience wants and he rarely gives it to them			2
but in a rare case , the audience wanted this , very badly , for many a year			2
it 's one of the few times that @entity13 's plans happened to coincide with what the general population of " @entity1 " wanted			1
so i 'm kinda glad to give the people a little something that they 've been longing for			2
to be honest , i take a hit much better than i give one			2
@entity30 : when you get a script with @entity4 in a fight , what 's your reaction ? do you research how a guy in the ' 60s would fight			1
@entity10 : most fights that i saw growing up in high school and most fights i 've seen as an adult at bars are pretty stupid			1
they look ridiculous and rarely do they look two guys who know what they 're doing			2
so , i did n't do any research			2
we have a team of people who are very good at researching that stuff			2
we showed up a week before the fight and had stunt coordinators and had been schooled in the research of the era and what @entity13 wanted			2
i 've done a lot of shows where there 's fighting and often times the stunt coordinators can get carried away , throwing in fancy moves and special punches			2
i love @entity13 because he comes in and says " no , that 's not real , that would never happen			2
take three punches out and make it real			2
" i think most people who have seen a fight in real life would be like " @entity104 , that 's about right : two guys who should never be throwing down are taking crazy swings at each other and one guy gets plunked in the nose and that 's game			2
" @entity30 : punches aside , one of the interesting aspects that we 're still seeing evolve with this show is @entity4 's relationship with @entity120			1
in a recent episode he was so giddy that his boss was coming to his house			2
you never see him that happy			0
@entity10 : well , it 's a rite of passage			1
@entity120 is finally accepting him as a friend , as an equal ! making the trek out to @entity129 on the weekend , it seems like he 's going out his way for @entity4			1
and @entity4 really seems like he needs that kind of attention			1
@entity133 said , " in this scene , you 're basically like ' aw , shucks , boss			0
you came on down to @entity129			0
' that whole idea of " aw , shucks , " it really helped me in that scene in hitting the right tone			0
@entity30 : the show over the years and certainly now hints at these socio - political changes that are happening outside of the office and might be trickling in now			1
is that a big thing for this season ? @entity10 : the times are a-changing and in the first few episodes we 've seen it make its way into @entity156			1
times have been changing for the last few years			0
there 's been riots and integration and things have been changing but it has n't affected the lives of these people as profoundly as we maybe the history books would want you to believe			0
let 's take something huge , like the war in @entity170			0
it 's huge and in 30 years we 'll look back and think that everybody 's life was inundated with this war but for most of the people i know , including myself , it had very little effect on us			0
it has an effect , but we ca n't quite see it yet			0
it 's the same with the 1960s , and we look back and say : " oh , there were these great changes , everyone must 've felt it			0
" it takes a while for these things to take effect in the exclusive , upper - and middle - class office buildings			1
we 're just starting to see it now			0
it 's ' 66 and it 's starting to hit home			0
@entity30 : the show has a handful of directors that are used frequently			0
are there stylistic differences that each have that you 're seeing shape different aspects of your performance ? @entity10 : every director brings a little taste of themselves			1
at the end of the day , @entity13 has final cut			0
at the end of the day , @entity13 will re-shoot a scene if it does n't fit into the look of the show			0
everyone has stylistic differences and he wants them to express those things , but he wants to make sure that there 's a consistency to the look of the show , to the tone of the show			0
that being said , i absolutely love @entity133 as a director			0
he loves the art form of it			0
@entity30 : do you relate to @entity4 at all at this stage in the show in any way ? @entity10 : all sorts of times			1
something that @entity13 does wonderfully , is that he writes for his actors			0
he says : " what do these people deal with in real life ? " @entity4 feels emasculated , he feels a bit insecure about his place among the men of the world			1
... he does n't have that machismo or the elegance of the men that surround him			1
i think i can relate to some of those things and some of the way @entity4 hates himself and worries that the world hates him for those things too			1
now , granted , i 'm not trying to say i 'm @entity4			1
those issues reside in me as deeply as they do as him			0
but i have understood those through my life			0
i think most people can			0
i think if people took a fearless look at themselves , they 'd see a lot more @entity4 than they 'd want to believe			1
@entity30 : there 's a great line in this @entity258 interview where you said people are always asking you about highbrow stuff , but sometimes you 're just a lowbrow dude			0
i picture you sitting around listening to @entity262 and enjoying whoopee cushions			0
@entity10 : ( @entity264 ) no , i do n't think i 'm a lowbrow dude , feeding off @entity265 and watching @entity266 all afternoon			1
i enjoy reading literature and learning about the world			0
this show deals with some complex issues -- every episode contains a theme and they come from the minds of some really intelligent people			0
i 'm just saying i do n't know if i 'm the best person to answer those types of questions			0
as much as i do n't think i 'm an idiot , those ideas are very profound .			0

@entity10 plays @entity4 , a young go - getter on " @entity1 "
@entity4 is slimy and cruel and will step right over you to climb the corporate ladder
@entity10 : " i can relate to ... some of the way @entity4 hates himself "
