@entity0 -- we 're getting to the point where even good news comes wrapped in bad news			2
good news : despite the terrible june job numbers ( 125,000 jobs lost as the @entity10 finished its work ) , one sector continues to gain -- manufacturing			1
factories added 9,000 workers in june , for a total of 136,000 hires since december 2009			2
so that 's something , yes ? maybe not			0
despite millions of unemployed , despite 2 million job losses in manufacturing between the end of 2007 and the end of 2009 , factory employers apparently can not find the workers they need			2
here 's what the @entity24 reported friday : " the problem , the companies say , is a mismatch between the kind of skilled workers needed and the ranks of the unemployed			1
" during the recession , domestic manufacturers appear to have accelerated the long - term move toward greater automation , laying off more of their lowest - skilled workers and replacing them with cheaper labor abroad			1
" now they are looking to hire people who can operate sophisticated computerized machinery , follow complex blueprints and demonstrate higher math proficiency than was previously required of the typical assembly line worker			0
" it may sound like manufacturers are being too fussy			2
but they face a real problem			0
as manufacturing work gets more taxing , manufacturers are looking at a work force that is actually becoming less literate and less skilled			1
in 2007 , @entity52 -- the people who run the country 's standardized tests -- compiled a battery of scores of basic literacy conducted over the previous 15 years and arrived at a startling warning : on present trends , the country 's average score on basic literacy tests will drop by 5 percent by 2030 as compared to 1992			0
that 's a disturbing headline			0
behind the headline is even worse news			0
not everybody 's scores are dropping			0
in fact , @entity52 estimates that the percentage of @entity70 who can read at the very highest levels will actually rise slightly by 2030 as compared to 1992 -- a special national " thank you " to all those parents who read to their kids at bedtime ! but that small rise at the top is overbalanced by a collapse of literacy at the bottom			1
in 1992 , 17 percent of @entity70 scored at the very lowest literacy level			1
on present trends , 27 percent of @entity70 will score at the very lowest level in 2030			1
what 's driving the deterioration ? an immigration policy that favors the unskilled			1
immigrants to @entity90 and @entity91 typically arrive with very high skills , including @entity94 - language competence			2
but the @entity70 has taken a different course			1
since 2000 , the @entity70 has received some 10 million migrants , approximately half of them illegal			1
migrants to the @entity70 arrive with much less formal schooling than migrants to @entity90 and @entity91 and very poor @entity94 - language skills			1
more than 80 percent of @entity103 adult migrants to the @entity70 score below what @entity52 deems a minimum level of literacy necessary for success in the @entity70 labor market			1
let 's put this in concrete terms			0
imagine a migrant to the @entity70			1
he 's hard - working , strong , energetic , determined to get ahead			0
he speaks almost zero @entity94 , and can barely read or write even in @entity114			0
he completed his last year of formal schooling at age 13 and has been working with his hands ever since			0
he 's an impressive , even admirable human being			0
maybe he reminds some @entity70 of their grandfather			1
and had he arrived in this country in 1920 , there would have been many , many jobs for him to do that would have paid him a living wage , enabling him to better himself over time -- backbreaking jobs , but jobs that did not pay too much less than what a fully literate @entity94 - speaking worker could earn			2
during the debt - happy 2000s , that same worker might earn a living assembling houses or landscaping hotels and resorts			0
but with the @entity138 , the bottom has fallen out of his world			0
and even when the recession ends , we 're not going to be building houses like we used to , or spending money on vacations either			0
we may hope that over time the children and grandchildren of @entity147 's immigrants of the 1990s and 2000s will do better than their parents and grandparents			2
for now , the indicators are not good : @entity70 - born @entity151 drop out of high school at very high rates			1
over time , yes , they 'll probably catch up -- by the 2060s , they 'll probably be doing fine			0
but over the intervening half century , we are going to face a big problem			2
we talk a lot about retraining workers , but we do n't really know how to do it very well -- particularly workers who can not read fluently			2
our schools are not doing a brilliant job training the native - born less advantaged : even now , a half - century into the civil rights era , still one - third of black @entity70 read at the lowest level of literacy			1
just as we made bad decisions about physical capital in the 2000s -- overinvesting in houses , underinvesting in airports , roads , trains , and bridges -- so we also made fateful decisions about our human capital : accepting too many unskilled workers from @entity147 , too few highly skilled workers from @entity177 and @entity178			1
we have been operating a human capital policy for the world of 1910 , not 2010			2
and now the @entity138 is exposing the true costs of this malinvestment in human capital			0
it has wiped away the jobs that less - skilled immigrants can do , that offered them a livelihood and a future			1
who knows when or if such jobs will return ? meanwhile the immigrants fitted for success in the 21st century economy were locating in @entity90 and @entity91			1
@entity70 do not believe in problems that can not be quickly or easily solved			1
they place their faith in education and re-education			0
they do not like to remember that it took two and three generations for their own families to acquire the skills necessary to succeed in a technological society			0
they hate to imagine that their country might be less affluent , more unequal , and less globally competitive in the future because of decisions they are making now			0
yet all these things are true			0
we can not predict in advance which skills precisely will be needed by the @entity70 economy of a decade hence			1
nor should we try , for we 'll certainly guess wrong			0
what we can know is this : immigrants who arrive with language and math skills , with professional or graduate degrees , will adapt better to whatever the future economy throws at them			2
even more important , their children are much more likely to find a secure footing in the ultratechnological economy of the mid- 21st century			2
and by reducing the flow of very unskilled foreign workers into the @entity70 , we will tighten labor supply in ways that will induce @entity70 employers to recruit , train and retain the less - skilled native born , especially african - americans -- the group hit hardest by the great recession of 2008 - 2010			1
in the short term , we need policies to fight the recession			0
we need monetary stimulus , a cheaper dollar , and lower taxes			0
but none of these policies can fix the skills mismatch that occurs when an advanced industrial economy must find work for people who can not read very well , and whose children are not reading much better			0
the @entity70 needs a human capital policy that emphasizes skilled immigration and halts unskilled immigration			1
it needed that policy 15 years ago , but it 's not too late to start now			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity253 .			1

some jobs remain *unfilled* because not enough skilled workers , manufacturers say
@entity253 : immigration policy has created *influx* of unskilled labor
he says pool of new workers more suited to needs of last century
@entity268 : @entity70 policy should emphasize admitting highly skilled immigrants
