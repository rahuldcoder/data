@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the movie " @entity5 , " @entity3 plays a man who loses his family when his wife and daughter are raped and murdered			2
after the main culprit receives a light sentence as part of a plea bargain and gets released from prison much sooner than he should have , our hero goes all " @entity18 " on the creep			2
he kidnaps him , drugs him and surgically dissects him into two - dozen pieces			0
vengeance is wrong and ca n't be condoned			1
but when you 're caught up in the tension of the film , it looks like something else : justice			0
in any case , i would n't be surprised if , throughout @entity32 , video stores are having trouble keeping that movie on the shelf			1
for the last 10 days , 3.2 million people have been working through a collective sense of fury and sorrow and more fury over two gruesome discoveries and one depressing revelation			0
the discoveries came when authorities found -- within days of each other -- the bodies of two teenage girls , 17 - year - old @entity48 of @entity49 , @entity1 , and 14 - year - old @entity48 of @entity50 , @entity1			0
@entity48 had gone for an afternoon run in a local park a few days earlier			0
@entity48 had vanished a year earlier while walking to school			0
@entity48 , a convicted sex offender , is charged with murdering @entity48			1
a preliminary hearing for @entity48 , who is also " a focus of the investigation " into the death of @entity48 , has been scheduled for august 4			0
@entity32 district attorney @entity58 has said that @entity48 is eligible for the death penalty but she has n't decided if she will seek it			1
the revelation , as more details surface about @entity48 and his history with the criminal justice system , is that the system for dealing with repeat sex offenders and child predators is , in @entity1 and probably other states as well , beyond broken			1
a wounded and grieving community wants to know why someone like @entity48 , a known sex offender , was not still sitting in a jail cell after an earlier offense or at least under some kind of monitored electronic supervision			1
people want to know how it is that @entity48 -- who was sentenced to six years in prison in 2000 for molesting , beating and falsely imprisoning a 13 - year - old girl but eventually served only five years and three years on parole -- was apparently able to move freely and do as he pleased			1
supposedly , @entity48 was being monitored by the state @entity81 , for whatever that 's worth , and it might not be worth all that much			1
the @entity83 reported yesterday that @entity48 violated his parole by moving too close to a school but was allowed to remain free , according to parole records obtained by the news agency			1
the records also show several other violations			0
had @entity48 been returned to prison , he would have been evaluated for commitment to a state mental hospital as a sexually violent predator and qualified for wearing an electronic tracking device for the rest of his life			2
we may never know what parole officers observed and concluded when they observed @entity48 on the outside			2
corrections officials claim that his " field file " was destroyed under a department policy that requires documents be destroyed within one year after a person 's release from parole			1
here you have a state agency known for backlogs and inefficiency and , yet , in this case , it miraculously managed to summon the efficiency to destroy a file just when it was authorized to do so			1
the media should keep digging until it finds out exactly when the file was destroyed , by whom , and under what authority			1
and if it comes out that the file was destroyed after the girls ' bodies were found and @entity48 was arrested , then watch out			1
yet , even if corrections officials are telling the truth , this policy is a bad fit for repeat sex offenders who tend to , by definition , repeat their crimes			1
in most cases , according to the research , it 's only a matter of time			2
so why destroy the file ? chances are that you 're going to need it again sooner or later			2
to his credit , gov. @entity143 , upon learning of this outrageous practice , got the chance to be a real - life action hero when he ordered the @entity147 to stop destroying the field files			0
score one for the good guys			0
there will be more victories to come			0
reform activists -- under the leadership of assemblyman @entity154 , who represents the cities where @entity48 and @entity48 lived -- have started what could turn out to be a national crusade to change the sex offender laws , close the loopholes and increase penalties in order to keep our children safe			1
maybe where we 're headed is something like " one and @entity168 " where , if you 're convicted of sexually assaulting a child , you go away for 25 years			0
or maybe those on parole should wear an electronic bracelet for life that is programmed to sound an alarm when the parolee goes near a park or a school			2
everything is on the table , @entity154 said at a news conference this week			0
because we remain a compassionate society , there will always be those who say that sexual predators are sick and that what they really need is treatment			0
monsters like @entity48 who prey on children are sick			0
but they ca n't be cured			2
so what they need , on the first offense , is to be put away for a long time -- or , if subject to the death penalty , to be put down			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202			1

sex offender charged in a teen 's murder and *suspected* in another murder
@entity202 : why was n't he in *custody* or being monitored ?
he says laws should be changed to prevent similar crimes
offender 's parole file was destroyed by a state agency
