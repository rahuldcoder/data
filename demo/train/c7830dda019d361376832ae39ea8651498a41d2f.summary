editor 's note : @entity2 is a film , television and web producer , an adjunct professor at the @entity7 at the @entity8 , and a gay rights activist			1
@entity2 says there 's growing support for recognition of gay unions and gay marriage			1
@entity15 ( @entity16 ) -- my battle for marriage equality began in 1990 , after my partner , @entity20 , and i had a commitment ceremony			1
the ceremony was held at the end of a conference for parents and @entity26 and was attended by more than 300 friends and members of both our families			0
we were featured in a couple of books on gay marriage because the concept was so new at the time			1
we also registered as domestic partners and entered into every possible form of legal recognition available at the time			0
a few years later , @entity20 was visiting his parents in @entity40 to inform them that he was giving up his battle with @entity42			0
something went horribly wrong , and he was rushed to the hospital			0
as his caretaker , i knew his medical condition and had been involved in every medical decision			0
we had shared the joy of making a commitment to one another and the pain and suffering of a horrible disease			0
but when i arrived , i was told i could not see him because i was not " family " and because my legal documents were valid only in @entity59			0
even as i heard him calling out my name , they refused to let me see him because we were not married			0
in 1995 , i helped organize the first @entity64 to marry march in @entity15			0
ten years later , the idea for @entity66 was conceived			0
ireport.com : are you taking part in " @entity66 ? " i was discussing same - sex marriage with @entity71 , my colleague at the @entity72			1
i proposed a gay version of @entity74 , an ancient @entity76 satire about @entity78 women who withheld sex from their husbands until they agreed to stop going to war			2
she replied , " what if gays went on strike instead ? " and the idea was born			2
we convinced @entity72 to produce a movie based on the idea , which became a romantic comedy called " @entity92 " that aired on the network in 2006			0
critics compared the film to " @entity97 , " which led to the one - day protest by the @entity100 community called @entity96			1
in the wake of the passage of @entity103 in @entity59 , which banned same - sex marriage , i posted the event on @entity106			2
my fellow organizer , @entity107 , inspired by the @entity100 protests , suggested we call it @entity66			0
we soon discovered that other organizers had conceived of the same idea simultaneously , and we all agreed to schedule the protest for december 10 , which is @entity114			1
a week later , @entity115 , the group that organized @entity117 rallies nationwide november 14 , joined forces with us			2
our goal is to raise awareness that marriage is a " basic human right " as declared by the @entity124 @entity123 in loving v. @entity125 , the case that ended race - based restrictions on marriage			2
we believe that to deny gays and lesbians that right , and the 1,400 state and federal legal and economic benefits of marriage , is discrimination and in violation of the 14th amendment			1
we are asking people who support us to " call in gay " to their workplace by taking the day off or to shut down their businesses			1
our goal is to raise awareness that we are gay and lesbian @entity124 who work , own businesses , pay our taxes and support the economy to the tune of $ 712 billion a year , according to an analysis by @entity149 , a public relations agency that specializes in the gay and lesbian consumer market			1
this is a declaration that we take our rights seriously and demand full equality			1
our @entity106 site has had a million visitors , and more than 225,000 people indicate that they will or might participate			0
there are also more than 17,000 postings from participants who have taken the time to debate , support and / or deride these issues			2
there is still much to do			0
thirty states have passed bans on same - sex marriage			2
thirty states allow employers to fire someone based on sexual orientation , according to the @entity173			0
some states have instituted or are considering bans that directly or indirectly prevent gays and lesbians from adopting or fostering children			2
in addition , the passage of the @entity178 by @entity179 in 1996 denies civil unions what @entity183 's campaign described as the more than 1,100 benefits of marriage including immigration , taxation , @entity189 and veteran 's benefits			1
a recent @entity193 poll reflects that , for the first time , a majority of @entity124 now believe that gay and lesbian couples deserve recognition , with 55 percent supporting legally sanctioned unions			1
it found increased backing for inheritance and other rights and found that 39 percent favor gay marriage			1
the tide is clearly turning in our favor , and i believe that love , equality and support for all families will triumph			1
in the words of @entity213 , " we will be citizens			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : i *'ve* been battling for marriage equality for gays since 1990
he says civil unions do *n't* provide same level of rights and benefits as marriage
@entity2 is part of a group organizing " day without gays " protest for december 10
@entity2 : poll shows growing support for gay unions and for gay marriage
