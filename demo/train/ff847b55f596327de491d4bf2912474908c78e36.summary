@entity1 forty - three elite police commandos were killed by @entity4 insurgents in the southern @entity5 sunday , when they were ambushed while pursuing " high value " terrorist bomb makers			1
the commandos , members of the elite @entity11 ( @entity10 ) unit of the @entity12 , were killed in a firefight that raged for 12 hours in @entity16 town , @entity17 , said police deputy director general @entity18			1
eleven police commandos had also been wounded in the firefight , he told a press conference in @entity22 monday			1
members of both the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) , with whom the government has signed a peace agreement , and the @entity32 ( @entity32 ) , with whom it has not , were involved in the firefight , officials and rebel groups said			1
grisly footage purporting to be of the aftermath of the battle was circulated online , showing uniformed bodies strewn in a rice field			2
" this is the single largest loss of life in recent memory , " secretary of the @entity38 told the press conference , calling for a moment of silence from assembled reporters			2
" these @entity10 operatives are fallen heroes			2
they were just doing their job ... that is why we salute them			2
" @entity51 said that 392 @entity10 commandos been engaged to hunt @entity54 bomb - maker and @entity56 leader @entity55 , known as @entity57 , and @entity5 bomb maker @entity58			1
the @entity59 says that @entity57 , who is suspected of having conducted bomb making training for @entity61 and has a $ 5 million @entity63 bounty for information leading to his arrest , is believed to have been hiding in the country 's south since 2003			1
the @entity69 government is also offering a reward of up to $ 1 million for information leading to @entity72 's arrest			0
@entity51 said the commandos were retreating from the assault on their targets when they came under fire from members of the @entity32			1
in maneuvering away from the @entity32 assault , they strayed into territory controlled by the @entity28 several kilometers away , and a " misencounter " ensued			0
the government had not been seeking to sabotage the peace agreement with the @entity28 by carrying out the operation without their knowledge , he said			0
" we are hopeful and confident that this will not derail the peace talks , " he said			0
" this was not directed against @entity28 , but this is directed against a very , very specific high - profile terrorist bomber who was in the area			0
" @entity18 said that it was " most highly likely " that @entity57 has been killed in the @entity10 assault , and dna testing was being carried out to confirm this			1
but initial reports suggested that @entity72 had fled			1
a board of inquiry would conduct an investigation into the operation , including looking into the apparent lack of coordination with @entity28 forces in the area , said @entity18			0
@entity105 , chief negotiator for the @entity28 , said in an interview with @entity5 radio station @entity107 that a lack of coordination between the @entity28 ceasefire committee and the government was to blame for the outbreak of violence			1
it was a standard operating procedure that one side should notify the other before they began an operation , he said , describing the incident as self defense			0
while the area where the fighting occurred was mostly under @entity28 control , he said , @entity32 , which was also involved in the firefight , was a mobile group , moving throughout the region			1
" chances are they were just there when it happened , " he said			0
he said his group was doing everything it could to ease tensions over the fighting , and that the incident would not have an effect on the ongoing peace process			0
the @entity5 signed an agreement with the @entity28 , the largest rebel group in the south , in march last year			1
the deal offered greater autonomy , economic and political power in return for the rebels surrendering their weapons and ending a decades - long insurgency			2
but hardline rebel groups opposed to the peace process , such as the @entity32 , remain active			2
lieutenant colonel @entity146 , public affairs office chief for the @entity147 , appealed to the hardline @entity32 group monday to return any personnel under their control			0
" we are also calling on our brothers in the @entity32 that if indeed they are still holding some of the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) personnel , they must respect their rights and they must be returned to their mother units and ultimately to their family members , " he told reporters			0
@entity158 , chair of the government panel responsible for overseeing the peace process with @entity4 insurgents , said in a statement monday that the violence highlighted the " challenges that confound the peace process			1
" but the outbreak only strengthened the resolve of the peace panel to implement the " @entity169 " -- the bill , currently being heard by politicians , that seeks to implement the peace deal between the government and the @entity28			0
hearings of the bill were suspended monday following the violence			0
" with better cooperation , we will be able to prevent these kinds of incidents , " she said .			0
