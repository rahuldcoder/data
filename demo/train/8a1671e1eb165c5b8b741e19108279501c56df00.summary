they said they 're working to contain the outbreak there and prevent its spread to the densely populated capital			1
chaos reigned acrooss the @entity26 and @entity27 regions friday , as hospitals overflowed with people rushing to get help from the fast - moving cholera outbreak			1

a person can get cholera by drinking water or eating food contaminated with the bacteria			2

" so far , we 've been able to manage it , " @entity155 said , noting that new patients were now coming in via pick - up trucks about every 10 minutes			0
temperatures in the mid- 90s exacerbated the dual concerns about dehydration and people contracting cholera by drinking tainted water			2
people lined roadsides in and around villages with buckets , according to @entity43 , hoping that passerby might have clean water			0
he said that his organization on thursday helped install one water filtration unit , capable of providing 10,000 gallons of clean drinking water , and planned to install another two friday			0

whatever the cause , @entity43 said the scene this week at hospitals in and around @entity40 eerily resembled what happened in @entity28 after the colossal quake			1
