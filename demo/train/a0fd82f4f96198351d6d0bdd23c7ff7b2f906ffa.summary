-- @entity1 has issued an apology for spoiling the results of teen swimmer @entity5 's gold medal - winning race			1
in the latest controversy during the network 's highly rated @entity8 coverage , @entity1 ran a " today " show promo on monday night that revealed the outcome of the heavily anticipated 100 - meter backstroke before the event was actually telecast			1
now @entity1 's sports division , which has been pretty adamant about the merits of its tape - delay strategy as public criticism mounts , has issued a statement admitting the network screwed up			1
" clearly that promo should not have aired at that time , " said an @entity20 spokesperson in a statement			2
" we have a process in place and this will not happen again			0
we apologize to viewers who were watching and did n't know the result of the race			0
" @entity1 's today show ad announced last night , " when you 're 17 years old and win your first gold medal , there 's nobody you 'd rather share it with , " and showed footage of @entity32 holding the gold medal and with her parents			1

meanwhile one vocal critic of @entity1 whose @entity61 account was suspended after he tweeted a network executive 's email address has been given his account back			1
