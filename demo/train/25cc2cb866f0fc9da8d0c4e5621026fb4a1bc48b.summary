before saturday 's police shooting of an @entity5 teenager , @entity0 , @entity1 , was known as one of hundreds of municipalities designated by a national nonprofit as a " @entity9 , " a place where children are supposed to have access to more opportunities to play in their communities			1
but the shooting death of @entity16 , a college - bound 18 - year - old , by a police officer has brought national attention to the mostly black community for another reason			1
witnesses and residents say the young man was unarmed			0
police say he tried to take an officer 's gun			1
authorities , citing threats and safety issues , have refused to identify the officer			0
tensions remain high after isolated looting incidents and dozens of arrests in the @entity38 suburb of 22,400			0
to locals and longtime observers , the tension has been brewing since the 1970s , when @entity0 underwent a racial transformation			1
once predominantly white , the city became overwhelmingly black as white families moved out during the racial integration of public schools			1
at the same time , many @entity5 - @entity5 families started to move to @entity0 from @entity38 and surrounding communities			1
" this whole situation has been boiling for a while , " said @entity49 , a @entity38 alderman who lives five miles from @entity0			1
" it 's not just the death of @entity16 but the way it 's been handled by the local government and the response to the community 's outrage that forced this to boil over			1
" a white man 's response to @entity0 on thursday , @entity1 gov. @entity62 acknowledged long - simmering tensions between the community and police			1
" this feels a little like an old wound that has been hit again , " he said			0
" the key to this is ... ultimately getting to some of these deeper problems			0
these are deep and existing problems not only in @entity1 but in @entity73			1
this has clearly touched a nerve , and that nerve is not merely from this horrific incident that happened just a few short days ago			0
" advocates for effective policing contend that law enforcement should reflect the diversity of the community it polices			0
when that is out of balance , however , an incident such as the @entity16 shooting can cause tensions to boil over			1
what 's happening in @entity0 today is a perfect example , said @entity91 , a history professor at @entity92 in @entity93			1
" this is what happens when you have massive racial change in a community and the power structure remains in the hands of whites and the police force acts as this sort of mediating force between the white power structure and what is now a black community and has very little empathy or knowledge about that community			1
" racial disparity two - thirds of @entity0 's population is black , and yet the mayor is white , and so are five of the six city council members			1
the police chief is also white			1
there are only three african - americans on the 53 - person police force			1
" this all gets back to segregation , " @entity91 said			0
" the school boards , the police force , the juvenile courts remain the same			2
the population changes before the power structure changes			2
... it happened across the country when there was very rapid resegregation of a town , a neighborhood or a city			2
" @entity0 police chief @entity135 admitted wednesday that diversity on the force was a " constant struggle " but said race relations were a top priority for his department			1
he also said the officer who shot @entity16 was assaulted before opening fire on the young man			1
according to a 2013 report released by the @entity1 attorney general , african - americans are not under - represented in crime statistics			1
they accounted for 93 % of arrests after traffic stops , 92 % of searches and 86 % of traffic stops			2
the @entity38 area has always been one of the most racially segregated regions in the country , according to @entity91 and other experts			0
it was in @entity38 that a federal judge in 1847 returned @entity160 to slavery in a decision upheld by the @entity73 @entity163 , which ruled that african - americans were not @entity5 citizens and could not sue in federal court			1
deadly race riots erupted in @entity168 in the early 1900s			0
the looting and angry protests that followed @entity16 's death , @entity91 said , are part of the " historical lineage of violence and segregation			1
" while all the facts surrounding the @entity16 shooting have yet to come out , @entity91 said , the disconnect between the community and law enforcement can have lasting effects			1
" it 's just a terrible spiral of oppression , " she said			2
" the reaction of rioting in response to police brutality is classic			2
other kinds of oppression that black people face , say in the school or other places , it 's not on your body			2
it 's not as personally invasive			2
but police brutality hurts in a sharper , more profound and immediate way			2
people can relate to what happened to this boy			0
" racial profiling training @entity135 told @entity205 this week that he was working to improve the diversity of the force			0
racial profiling , he said , was " strictly forbidden			0
" " we actually have mandatory racial profiling training that we have to take to be certified , " he said			0
" racial profiling is against our policies			0
" @entity215 , a criminal justice professor at the @entity216 and a former @entity218 police officer , said that a more diverse police force does n't always translate into better police relations with a community			0
" if the cops are not treating the citizens appropriately , is it a question of the cops not doing their job right because they 're not trained well or they 're knuckleheads or they hold racial animus ? " he said			0
" who knows ? but if you bore down and it turns out that there 's racial animus , then you have a real big problem on top of the lack of professionalism , because that 's a flashpoint in our society			0
we have a rough history in @entity73 regarding race relations			0
and the police , unfortunately , have been on the wrong side of that			0
" @entity247 , retired chief of police in @entity38 and a criminal justice professor at the @entity216 , said the diversity of the police rank and file and command definitely affects community relations			0
" when you look across the nation , it 's not uncommon for police departments to have a racial makeup that is not consistent with the community , " he said			2
" you do n't have a political or community push for improvement until something like the @entity16 shooting happens			1
" according to the @entity265 , about a quarter of police officers across the nation were ethnic minorities in 2007 , compared with a sixth of officers in 1987			2
@entity247 hopes the tragedy leads to change			0
" there are so many questions to be asked beyond just the shooting , " @entity247 said			0
" certainly , the police department 's makeup , the relationship with the community			2
hopefully , this brings a bigger conversation : why does this happen in the @entity5 - @entity5 community ? what are the deeper issues we have to resolve between communities and police ? " other factors about @entity0 need to be considered , observers said			1
according to the 2010 census , community residents are mostly young ; the average age is 31			0
median household income is $ 37,000 : about $ 10,000 less than @entity1 as a whole			2
about one - fifth of @entity0 residents live in poverty			1
african - americans are much worse off economically than whites , with a 25 % poverty rate that 's more than twice that of whites , according to the most recent government estimates from two years ago			1
their median income is only about 60 % that of their white counterparts			2
" @entity0 's black community is a very transient community , living in rental housing , " said @entity49 , the @entity38 alderman			1
" not many people register to vote , and even less participate in elections			0
... people are living day to day out there , and part of their daily existence is negative encounters with the police			0
they want to be heard			0
they want their frustration to be recognized			0
" complete coverage on @entity16 's shooting @entity0 police slammed for ' escalating the situation ' opinion : why @entity0 is your town			1

@entity0 , @entity1 , was one of hundreds of municipalities designated a " @entity9 "
the shooting death of @entity16 , 18 , by police has put it in the national *spotlight*
three of the city 's 53 officers are african - american
63 % of @entity0 's population is black ; *34* % is white
