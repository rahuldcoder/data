-- we do a lot for -- and to -- our children in the name of parenting			1
i know when i get it kinda right , i know when i get it mostly wrong , and i know when i 've been lucky			0
i will tell you that giving my teenage son a debit check card last summer was the best thing i 've ever done for him			1
i will also tell you that move was pure luck			0
i did n't plan to give him the card in order to teach him some grand lesson about life			1
i 'm not that clever			0
truth is , i was dropping him off at a monthlong summer camp and wanted to make sure he had some money in his pocket for pizza			1
so when i picked him up and he told me he had money left over , i was confused			1
" whose child is this and where is mine ? " this could n't be my son because my son claims he can barely get by with $ 50 on a night out with his friends			1
clearly i had picked up @entity37 's kid by mistake			1
intrigued , i decided to see if he was really frugal or if he had just misplaced his card for a couple of weeks and did n't want to tell me			1
so i deposited the money i had set aside for shopping for his school clothes into his account and told him to make it work			1
and man , did he ever			0
my son was comparing prices -- hitting the sale racks -- and he even returned items he later deemed too expensive or unnecessary			1
it was like the @entity53 in a mall			0
since then , pizzas only need one topping , chai lattes are few and far between and he packs his own lunch instead of hitting the fast food places down the street from school			0
" the first few times i blew it , " my 15 - year - old told me			0
" i 'd have all of this stuff and the cashier would be , like , ' i 'm sorry , sir , your card has been declined			1
' i 'd stand there and look surprised , my response was normally something like ' @entity72 ? or ' really ? hmm , one moment			0
i need to call my dad			0
' but you would n't always pick up , so i 'd have to take stuff back			1
now i 've learned to keep up with my balance so i can save myself the embarrassment			0
" in other words , he 's gotten cheap			2
and not because i made him do anything , but because he 's figuring life out for himself			2
it was the first time in my life i knew i was doing a good job			2
grades , opening door for strangers , saying thank you , those are all signs that he listens to me			0
making good decisions as an independent free thinker , that 's a sign that he gets it			1
seeing my son 's relationship with money transform in less than a year provided me with a snapshot of what his behavior might look like when he 's an adult , and all i could do was smile and exhale , thinking " he 's going to be all right			1
" growing up , i did n't know anything about money other than we did n't have any			2
in retrospect , it would 've been helpful if my parents had told me why			2
but as the research shows , most parents have the money talk in the same way they have the sex talk , and that is to say , they do n't			1
@entity117 released a study last month that found 77 % of parents do n't always tell their kids the truth about money matters , and nearly a third of parents surveyed said they do n't talk to their kids about family finances at all			1
i guess part of the reason is that the picture is n't always very pretty			0
in 2007 , @entity131 household debt was equal to the gdp			2
but just because the money talk is n't comfortable does n't mean we should avoid it , and a debit check card is a good way to bring it up			1
i have found since my son has started to feel the pain firsthand , when i talk to him about the bills around the house , he listens with empathy			2
when i remind him to turn the lights off when he leaves a room , he has an understanding of why that goes beyond " because i said so			0
" i still run him to track practice , the movies , anywhere he wants to go , but he gets why i plot out the errands ahead of time so i can use the least amount of gas possible			0
best of all , when he asks for something i think is unreasonable , i do n't lie and tell him we ca n't afford it -- as nearly 33 % of parents do			2
rather i tell him the truth : it 's not worth it			2
and i tell him why			0
you know for years , i 've heard financial experts stress the importance of teaching your kids about money , but it was n't until i saw my own son 's perspective change that i became a true believer			1
so , i encourage all parents out there to give it a try with their kids			1
i promise , even if you open a checking account for them and only deposit $ 10 , the return in their lives will come back a hundredfold in wisdom			0
over spring break i read him the story about @entity187 , the former @entity188 star who recently filed for bankruptcy			0
i did n't mean to laugh at someone else 's misfortune , but we both could n't help but crack up when i told him among @entity187 's listed " assets " were 240 pairs of @entity197 athletic shoes worth an estimated $ 6,500			2
" how is that an asset ? " my son asked			0
" it 's not , " i said			0
and then we started laughing again -- him because the story was funny , me because i know i just got lucky			0

@entity205 *accidentally* engaged in good parenting by giving his son a debit card
@entity212 's son , in control of his money , compared prices , went to sales , returned stuff
now @entity212 's son understands how you must *conserve* money and spend wisely
@entity212 says parents need to speak truthfully to their kids about household finances , money
