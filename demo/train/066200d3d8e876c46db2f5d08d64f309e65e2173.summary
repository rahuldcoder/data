@entity0 -- turns out the " gotcha " moment in thursday 's @entity6 debate was n't so clear cut			1
@entity9 @entity8 , who is vying for sen. @entity11 's seat , appeared to botch a question on @entity6 geography during the final debate in the contentious race			1
but after some post-debate map - checking , the former senator from @entity17 , who moved back to @entity6 after losing his @entity20 seat in 2013 , actually got an apology from the reporter who questioned the candidate 's familiarity with state geography			1
so did @entity8 get it right and @entity29 's @entity28 got it wrong ? turns out , both were partly right			0
poll : dead heat in @entity6 @entity20 race first , the incident : @entity28 , one of the state 's top political reporters , had his sights set on @entity8 's relative lack of in - state credentials and asked @entity8 to talk specifically about economic conditions in @entity41 -- one of 10 counties in the state			1
@entity8 did n't get into the specifics of @entity41 , but talked about the economic conditions " up @entity47			2
" " we 're talking about @entity41 , and i think you were talking about the north country , " @entity28 interjected , referring to the northern tier of the state that does n't include @entity41			0
" i 'm talking about any place past @entity54 , actually , " @entity8 retorted			2
@entity28 stuck to his line , explaining that @entity41 is " west of @entity54 , it 's not north of @entity54 , sen. @entity8			1
" that changed after the debate when @entity28 apologized on air and said " @entity8 was right , i was wrong			0
" now , the fact check : most of @entity41 is in fact north of the capital city of @entity54 , but @entity41 is also further west of the city than it is north			1
and a sliver of the county is even south of @entity54 , according to several maps			0
so in truth , the vast majority @entity41 is northwest of @entity54 , and even @entity8 conceded in a post-debate press conference that he " should have been more specific			2
" " i 've visited every county and i 'm going to continue to take that message of independence to every county , " he said			0
the nuance did n't keep @entity11 's campaign from pouncing on the opportunity to highlight @entity8 's outsider status			0
@entity11 's campaign even announced after the debate that she would head to @entity41 on friday .			0

@entity8 appeared to botch a question on @entity6 geography in the final @entity20 debate
but it 's not so clear he did , and the reporter who asked the question even apologized
most of @entity41 is north of @entity54 , but it 's further west of the capital city
