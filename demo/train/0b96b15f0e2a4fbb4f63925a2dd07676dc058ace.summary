-- the @entity1 is one step closer to retiring its nickname and mascot , but changing the school 's 90 - year - old @entity6 moniker -- the @entity8 -- has not been without complications			1
the school faces a monday deadline to comply with the @entity13 's policy on mascots " deemed hostile or abusive toward @entity15			1
" school officials were in the process of coming up with a new name and mascot this year until @entity20 legislators passed a law ordering them to stop , according to @entity1 spokesman @entity22			1
the rock and the hard place the school finds itself between marks the last gasp of a decades - long fight not just in @entity20 , but in all of college sports -- the climax ( or nadir , depending on some people 's perspective ) of a nostalgia - imbued resistance to political correctness on the playing field			0
the kerfuffle at hand dates to 2007 , when the @entity39 agreed to retire the @entity8 nickname by august 15 , 2011 , in accordance with the @entity13 's then - 2 - year - old policy on @entity6 mascots			1
if they ultimately chose not to do so , costly @entity13 sanctions were promised , including the inability to host any championships and a ban on the use of the school 's logo or nickname at any championship events			1
after gov. @entity54 signed @entity55 into law this year , the school was left with the dilemma of having to either disobey the government that controls its purse - strings or to flout the rules of the @entity13 , the entity that controls the arguably mightier purse - strings of college football			1
the nickname controversy appeared to be closer to a resolution friday when @entity54 and other state officials traveled to @entity66 to meet with @entity13 officials in a last - ditch effort to resolve the matter			1
" it 's our understanding coming out of this meeting that the @entity8 nickname and logo will be dropped , " the @entity13 quoted its vice president for communications @entity71 as saying friday			1
" the contingent from @entity20 made it clear that they were committed to changing the legislative action that would require retention of the @entity8 nickname and logo			1
however , our settlement agreement remains in effect , and , as a result , the @entity1 will be subject to the policy effective aug. 15			2
" @entity87 will be paying close attention to what happens monday			0
as commissioner of the @entity91 , he is overseeing @entity20 's ascent from @entity94 obscurity to the far more lucrative stage of @entity97 football			0
" when we invited ( @entity20 's football team ) into the ( @entity91 ) conference this was not an issue , " he said			0
citing the conference 's " close , close ties to native american tribes " and the promise of boycotts from other @entity97 schools if the name goes unchanged , he says the school 's membership in the conference " could be in jeopardy			0
" the school is set to join the conference july 1 , 2012			0
according to an @entity13 press release , @entity54 said at the friday meeting that he would appeal to the state legislature " to allow legislation to be introduced during a special session on nov. 7 that will transfer the responsibility for the logo and nickname from the legislature back to the @entity39			1
" " i have come to the conclusion that the cost of retaining the @entity8 logo is too great , " the @entity13 press release quoted @entity54 as saying			1
" there 's no question that the settlement agreement will stand according to the @entity13 , and there will be no further negotiations			2
" the usage of @entity6 imagery in college athletics has been a long - simmering controversy			2
such schools as @entity135 and @entity137 's @entity136 , elected to drop their nicknames ( the @entity139 became the @entity140 in 1972 , then the @entity141 in 1981 ; the @entity143 's @entity142 became the @entity144 in the mid- ' 90s ) , while others , like the @entity1 , balked			0
in 2000 , for example , then - @entity1 president @entity146 tried to retire the @entity8 until a wealthy alum threatened to withhold a $ 100 million donation for a new hockey arena , an episode chronicled by author @entity152 in her book " @entity154 : philanthropy and @entity155			2
" today , the school 's state - of - the - art rink not only bears that donor 's name , it 's decorated with more than 2,000 @entity8 logos			2
in 2005 , the @entity13 sought to end the controversy surrounding @entity6 mascots once and for all by ordering nearly 20 schools whose nicknames and mascots they deemed " abusive in terms of race , ethnicity or national origin " to either get @entity6 permission to use their name and likeness , or to come up with a new one			1
the resulting actions among the targeted schools were varied			0
the @entity178 became the @entity179 ; the @entity180 became the @entity181			0
other schools satisfied the mandate by tweaking their name , like @entity185 , where the @entity186 are now known as the @entity187			0
others , like the @entity189 , whose name does not affiliate with a specific tribe , were allowed to keep their name so long as @entity6 logos and imagery were eschewed			0
schools with higher - profile athletic programs fared better			0
the @entity197 , @entity198 and the @entity199 each obtained permission from their respective namesake tribes to stay the course			0
but the @entity8 of the @entity1 -- winners of seven national championships in men 's ice hockey -- was denied such an endorsement from the @entity208 of the @entity209 .			2

@entity1 faces a monday deadline to change its @entity8 nickname
the state legislature passed a law this year ordering the school to continue using the name
the school faces @entity13 sanctions if it continues to use the @entity6 mascot
governor has indicated he will comply with @entity13 , ask legislature to change law
