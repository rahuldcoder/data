an estimated 16 % of @entity9 adults are infected with herpes simplex virus type 2 ( @entity11 ) , which can cause bumps , blisters , or sores on the genitals and surrounding areas , along with pain and itching			1
but only about 10 % to 25 % of these people know they carry the virus			1
while some infected people have frequent outbreaks , most never have symptoms and others have just one or two flare - ups			2
previous research has shown that people infected with @entity11 can pass the virus to someone else through genital contact even if they do n't have symptoms			1
the new study -- the largest of its kind to date -- helps quantify that risk , says @entity34 , @entity35 , one of the study 's authors and an acting assistant professor of medicine at the @entity41 , in @entity42			0
" a lot of times people are diagnosed with @entity11 by an antibody test and they do n't know what to do with that information , " @entity43 says			1

the symptom - free people released the same amount of virus when they were shedding as the symptomatic people did when they were n't experiencing an outbreak			2
( the amount of virus increased if symptoms were present			0
) the 10 % figure is an average , @entity43 notes ; some people will shed the virus more frequently , while others will shed it less often			1
" people will interpret the risk very differently , " she adds			0
" some people will feel like 10 % is a lot and some people will feel like 10 % is a little			2

@entity0 : what to do if your partner refuses to wear a condom people with @entity11 can protect their partners from contracting the virus by using male or female condoms during sex , and by taking virus - suppressing drugs			1
