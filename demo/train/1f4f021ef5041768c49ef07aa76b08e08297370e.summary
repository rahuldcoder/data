@entity0 -- the government wasted billions of dollars this year by allowing questionable tax breaks and paying for unnecessary programs even as the economy faltered , a @entity7 senator charged in a report released monday			1
in his " @entity12 " report , sen. @entity9 of @entity10 pointed to 100 items including tax breaks to highly profitable sports leagues like the @entity16 , @entity18 funding to develop meals for a @entity21 mission that may not take place for decades and thousands of dollars for scientists to build a " robosquirrel " to see if rattlesnakes would try to eat it			1
@entity9 , a longtime crusader against waste , said better prioritizing and oversight could have saved taxpayers $ 18.9 billion on the programs included in the report , which was based largely on existing government studies , inspector generals ' findings and media reports			1
the @entity39 's @entity38 " share ( s ) sen. @entity9 's commitment to cutting out waste and will continue to fight to prevent such spending wherever we find it , " agency spokeswoman @entity37 said			1
" between 2010 and 2012 , the president proposed to @entity46 to eliminate , cut or save money in 228 government programs and the administration has already been successful in more than half of those , " she added			1
" where @entity46 has not acted , the president has moved aggressively through executive action to tackle unnecessary or excess spending			1
" declaring that he works alongside " compulsive spenders " on @entity57 , @entity9 in his report writes that with the struggling economy and the uncertainty of the looming fiscal cliff , it is imperative lawmakers reduce wasteful spending			1
" some try to rationalize the excessive borrowing and spending as necessary until the economy gets back on track , " the second term @entity7 said			2
" but the increased demand for help is precisely why @entity0 must be more careful how tax dollars are spent to ensure we can care for those who are truly in need			0
" the report includes a @entity78 grant for $ 325,000 for university researchers in @entity80 to develop a robotic squirrel to observe how rattlesnakes react , to study the interaction between predators and prey			0
the snakes appeared to accept the " robosquirrel " as real with one snake even biting off its head , @entity1 reported about the study in april			0
the report cites $ 27 million spent by the @entity93 to train @entity94 to make and sell pottery around the world			0
but the report , which cited a @entity93 inspector general report , says the program was riddled with problems , including having a translator at classes who was not fluent in @entity104 , and by using dyes and clay not available in that country			0
the study is critical of the continued production of the copper penny , which now costs more than two cents to make			0
it complains about $ 516,000 spent on a video game that simulates the social experience of attending a prom , $ 31,000 for @entity116 balloons to make appearances at balloon festivals , $ 300,000 to promote domestically produced caviar , and $ 268 million spent on a loophole for paper manufacturers that allows them to claim a waste byproduct is an alternative energy source			2
the report is critical of what it calls a professional sports loophole that allows leagues to be treated like trade or association groups and be exempt from federal income taxes on earnings			0
" hardworking taxpayers should not be forced to provide funding to offset tax giveaways to lucrative professional sports teams and leagues , " says the report , which estimates getting rid of the loophole would bring $ 91 million into the treasury			2
@entity141 , a spokesman for the @entity16 , said the league office itself " is classified as a not - for - profit under the tax code because the league office makes no profit			0
" he said the teams make the profits and they are taxed			0
@entity9 put much of the blame for the wasteful spending on @entity46 , which he described as deeply ineffectual and disliked by the @entity153 people			1
