free @entity9 rebels traded gunfire for mortar rounds from president @entity13 's troops along a critical fault line separating the suburb of @entity16 from @entity17 itself , said @entity18 , a spokesman for the local @entity19 , who gave only his first name for safety reasons			1
" there are heavy ongoing clashes at @entity24			0
if we capture the area it means we have reached the heart of the capital			0
it means we can cross into @entity17 , " @entity18 told @entity0			1
rebels appear to be inching closer to a decisive battle for the capital , @entity13 's stronghold , but after nearly two years of fighting the opposition remains wary			1
" we are still several hundred meters away and there are many snipers positioned on the buildings and tanks in the area			0
we expect very intense fighting over the next several days , " @entity18 said			2
the @entity41 is embroiled in near - constant clashes along three front lines on the western edge of the suburb of @entity16 -- the @entity24 entrance , a military air force building , and the vital 6 tishreen road dividing the government - controlled suburb of @entity50 from @entity16			1
western powers set to increase aid for @entity5 rebels reinforcements are arriving from eastern @entity55 and other suburbs , @entity18 said , and are being dispersed evenly to all three front lines			1
the opposition @entity58 told @entity0 on saturday that the @entity41 was now in control of a majority of @entity16			1
clashes are constant along a thin line leading to the edges of @entity64 , it said			0
the regime has stepped up its offensive using fighter jets and missiles to shell the suburb , it said			2
for civilians pinned down by the heavy fighting , survival is a daily struggle and escape a distant possibility			0
" there are still civilians here and they tell us , where can we go ? all of @entity79 is a battle ground -- there is nowhere to hide , " @entity18 said			2
historically , the suburb of @entity16 has been a holy site for @entity84 , drawing pilgrims to one of the oldest standing synagogues in the world			1
now bodies line the streets toward the central @entity64 , @entity18 claimed , and the 2,000 - year - old @entity91 sustains artillery attacks			0
" just as the homes and mosques are being struck , the synagogue was struck , too			0
the regime 's random shelling does not distinguish between buildings -- it can hit anything , " @entity18 said			0
@entity5 state media reported fighting in the @entity17 suburbs , claiming government armed forces were pursuing armed terrorist groups in the area and had inflicted heavy losses after a string of operations			1
@entity0 can not confirm opposition and government accounts of death tolls as access by international journalists is severely restricted			0
' chess game ' @entity5 foreign minister @entity115 held talks saturday with his @entity118 counterpart , @entity117 , in @entity119			1
@entity118 has been a constant ally of the embattled @entity13 regime			0
in a joint news conference on @entity118 's state - run @entity123 , @entity115 said the @entity5 army was acting to defend the people and was doing so within the framework of the law			1
@entity79 must " eliminate the sources of terrorism " and defend its sovereignty , he said			2
@entity79 will not turn into a " chess game " for the international community , he added , reiterating the government 's rejection of what it views as foreign interference in its affairs			1
both @entity115 and @entity117 questioned @entity139 support for rebel groups , saying such fighters were the cause of bloodshed in @entity79			2
@entity117 said @entity118 believes dialogue is needed to bring an end to the violence			0
the @entity5 government is ready to talk , he said			2
their remarks come two days after the @entity150 promised to send food and medical supplies -- but not weapons -- to rebels in the first such move since the conflict began nearly two years ago			2
at the same time , @entity158 nations began to explore how to strengthen rebel fighters short of arming them after a @entity161 decision allowing aid for civilian protection			0
@entity150 secretary of state @entity167 , speaking after meeting opposition leaders at a @entity79 conference in @entity166 , said the aid would help fighters in their effort to topple @entity13			1
he did not say how much aid , but did announce that the @entity150 would separately give $ 60 million to local groups working with the opposition @entity173 to provide political administration and basic services in rebel - controlled areas of @entity79			1
that 's on top of $ 50 million in similar aid the @entity150 has previously pledged to the council , as well as $ 385 million in humanitarian assistance , @entity167 said			0
