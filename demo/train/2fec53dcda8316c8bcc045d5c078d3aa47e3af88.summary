-- the mission is anything but a @entity4 task : navigate the world 's most treacherous seas , crossing 73,000 nautical kilometers in a confined space with stressed - out , sleep - deprived crewmates			1
that 's the challenge facing two sailors -- @entity11 and @entity12 -- who met on the set of a @entity15 movie			1
" when they say this is the hardest race in the world , that 's true , " @entity12 tells @entity0 as he reflects on the @entity16 , a grueling feat of endurance where competitors will face 30 - meter waves in the @entity21 and winds of 110 kph ( 68 mph )			1
with such conditions , tragedy is always a risk -- @entity31 sailor @entity30 died in the 2005 - 06 race when he was swept overboard			0
the nine - month event begins in @entity34 , @entity35 , on saturday			0
its eventual finish in june in @entity38 , @entity39 , will mark the longest route in the event 's 42 - year history			0
not surprisingly @entity12 , general manager of @entity43 , describes the buildup as the " calm before the storm , " while @entity11 admits it is impossible to predict what lies ahead in the coming months away from family and friends			1
to add a further twist in the marathon journey ahead , the @entity52 pair 's crew is the youngest in the race -- skipper @entity11 is 30 while @entity12 is just 25			1
they are reunited seven years after meeting on the set of @entity58 -- the brainchild of @entity60 , a nephew of the company 's legendary founder @entity62			0
@entity64 , who died in 2009 a year after its release , came up with the idea of getting a crew of aged 18 to 23 to compete in the @entity69 from @entity70 in @entity71 to @entity72 in @entity73			0
hundreds applied but just 15 were selected , among them @entity12 and @entity11			1
" i just put my application in at the last minute as my flatmates did it , " says @entity11			2
" i loved every minute			0
" from day one , despite the five - year age gap and differing backgrounds , the pair struck up a friendship that 's still going strong			0
@entity11 hails from @entity82 , a state awash with sailors , while @entity12 , from @entity73 , was the first in his family to take an interest in sailing			1
" they would n't know what the boom or the spinnaker pole was but they 're my biggest supporters , " says @entity12 , who followed his newfound friend to @entity91 university @entity89 where they studied and sailed			2
coached by @entity16 sailors , they took on board every nugget of information they could about offshore racing before signing up in 2011 to the race 's development program , learning the business side of getting together a team and the finances required			1
they worked tirelessly to get sponsors before @entity111 , a medical technologies company that had already been liaising with race organizers , became a financial backer			0
both parties ' involvement was made possible by a cost - cutting rule for the 2014 - 15 race which meant teams would no longer make their own boats but use a centrally built @entity16 65 one - design vessel by @entity122			1
it brought down the price of entering a team from $ 70 million to $ 21 million			1
" it 's a fairytale story , " says @entity12 , recalling the surprisingly swift sealing of the deal			2
" @entity111 is a young company growing rapidly and we are a young team , so it was the perfect fit with @entity52 sailors -- and @entity52 's a big market for them			0
" that sole meeting spilled over to dinner , followed by a night out which eventually ended at 1 a.m. with a handshake to confirm the partnership			0
@entity11 and @entity12 needed to be up at 6 a.m. for a flight home but snuck out for another drink on their own to celebrate what they had achieved			1
for @entity11 , it was the realization of a lifelong ambition			2
he recalls in grade two at school putting together a project on the @entity150 race , set up in 1972 and by which it was known until @entity16 became the title sponsor in 2001			1
" it 's the pinnacle of offshore racing , which is what i like most , and it just became a natural ambition , " he says			0
as skipper , he knows the buck stops with him on the water and he admits he thrives on both the pressure and responsibility of seven other sailors relying on him for their direction and personal safety			0
throughout the race , he will work closely with @entity12 as always , who he calls the yin to his yang , both with the shared aim " to keep each other honest			1
" @entity12 admits to having gone into hibernation in the buildup to the race , knowing that there will only be snippets of sleep in the next nine months , and he expects their friendship will be tested			1
" i 'd be lying if i said it was going to be peachy all the time , " says @entity12 , who turned down a job in renewable energy in @entity180 to follow his sailing ambitions			2
" there 's eight guys on a boat with not much space , stress and a lack of sleep			0
the dynamic of how we are as a group is important			0
" amid the young guns on board , @entity195 navigator @entity194 will provide experience			0
by the end of the race , the @entity16 veteran will have turned 50 and sailed competitively more than the distance to the moon during an impressive career			1
@entity194 's advice to @entity11 has been to " keep it all in perspective			2
" the two young sailors and their crew will also be hoping for a @entity15 ending			2
