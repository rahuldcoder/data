@entity0 -- keep your kids away from these @entity4 ! bar - goers dressed in christmas - themed costumes descended upon hundreds of cities worldwide saturday for the annual bar crawl known as @entity9			1
in @entity0 , thousands took to the streets dressed as elves , santas and holiday - themed characters , as they have since 1997			2
in recent years , the debauchery of some of its participants has become too much -- even for some who take part in it			1
" it was just terrible , they were throwing up in the streets			2
it was really just disgusting			0
i just put a red suit on and have a good time , " @entity25 , who participated in the event last year , told @entity27			2
" i think @entity0 generally are extremely tolerant of visitors , but when they come in such droves , and then combine that with public intoxication , it has a negative impact in our neighborhoods , " state sen. @entity30 said to @entity27			0
despite the controversy , city officials are supporting the event			0
" it 's what makes @entity47 , " police commissioner @entity43 said at a press conference friday			1
" there has been some rowdy activity by a small handful of people			0
" however , @entity53 officers were handing out fliers stressing that they would stop revelers who publicly consume alcohol			0
@entity57 is vowing to clean up its act			0
" @entity9 has had growing pains , " the event 's organizers said in a press release on the @entity63 website			1
" with a little elbow - grease from the elves , a little patience from the community , and just a pinch of holiday magic , @entity9 can spread joy			1
" @entity72 , a website that attempts to keep up with @entity74 wherever they are -- and assist organizers in publicizing them -- maintains a list that on saturday showed 146 locations where events will be taking place this weekend and next , from @entity80 , @entity81 , to @entity82 , @entity83 .			1
