-- last month , two political scientists published one of those rare op - eds that gets the political community talking			1
the thesis of the piece was contained in the title : " let 's just say it : the republicans are the problem			1
" in case that was not clear enough , the authors elaborated : " we have been studying @entity15 politics and @entity16 for more than 40 years , and never have we seen them this dysfunctional			1
" in our past writings , we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted			0
today , however , we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the @entity22			1
" the @entity23 has become an insurgent outlier in @entity26 politics			1
it is ideologically extreme ; scornful of compromise ; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts , evidence and science ; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition			1
" when one party moves this far from the mainstream , it makes it nearly impossible for the political system to deal constructively with the country 's challenges			1
" the piece drew its authority from the authors ' identity : @entity47 and @entity48 , two of @entity15 's most veteran watchers of @entity16			2
both men have hard - earned reputations for nonideological independence of mind despite their institutional affiliations : @entity47 works at the liberal @entity56 , @entity48 at the conservative @entity57			2
( @entity48 is a friend of mine , and was a colleague until i was given the heave - ho from @entity57 in march 2010			2
) now they have backed their provocative op - ed with a new book , " it 's even worse than it looks : how the @entity26 constitutional system collided with the @entity66			1
" the book backs the arresting op - ed with a battery of depressing research , substantiating their charge that congressional @entity22 now act in a uniquely irresponsible way			1
the debt showdown last summer was the ultimate case : congressional republicans nearly forcing a default on the obligations of the @entity26 to get their way on a budget agreement			0
but the pattern manifests itself in almost all the business of government , down to the most mundane			2
for example : because @entity86 rules often require unanimous consent to move to the next order of business , a determined minority can force delay on almost any action it opposes			0
since 2009 , @entity22 have used this power of delay hyper - aggressively			2
compare and contrast the treatment of executive - branch nominees			2
sixteen months into the @entity99 administration , @entity100 2002 , only 13 executive - branch nominations awaited confirmation by the @entity86			2
at the corresponding moment in the @entity105 administration , @entity100 2010 , 108 nominees were awaiting action by the @entity86			0
this comparison is supported by another academic study			0
the confirmation process got gradually slower between the 1960s and the 1990s			0
then , suddenly , in the second @entity113 administration , the confirmation process seized up			0
under the elder @entity99 , a @entity22 president facing a @entity115 senate , 92 % of nominees were confirmed within an average of 57 days			0
in the second @entity113 administration , facing a @entity22 senate , only 74 % of nominees were confirmed , taking an average of 110 days			0
@entity48 and @entity47 offer a convincing array of explanations for the trend toward radicalism within the @entity23 , including changes in campaign finance and in the electorate itself			1
they offer too a range of proposals to work around @entity23 radicalism and restore the effective functioning of @entity16			1
if those proposals have a faint wistful air to them , blame the inherent difficulty of the problem , not @entity47 and @entity48			2
but one thing is missing from their powerful and important book , and it 's a thought i 'd like to enter here into the record : the radicalization of the @entity23 is a function of changes , not only in @entity26 politics , but also in the @entity26 economy			1
@entity26 are living through an era of disappointment			0
it 's becoming obvious that the @entity26 government can not meet all the expectations that built up in better times			1
the tax status quo , the @entity157 status quo , the social safety net status quo , the defense status quo -- they ca n't all be sustained			0
something must give , and almost everybody senses it			0
in good times , we debate whether government should expand programs or cut taxes -- new benefits in either case			0
in these times , we are debating whether government should impose large reductions in programs or impose big increases in taxes -- taking from people benefits that they now enjoy			0
human beings will typically fight much more ferociously to keep what they possess than to gain something new			0
and the constituencies that vote @entity22 happen to possess the most and thus to be exposed to the worst risks of loss			0
the @entity22 voting base includes not only the wealthy with the most to fear from tax increases , but also the elderly and the rural , the two constituencies that benefit the most from federal spending and thus have the most to lose from spending cuts			1
all those constituencies together fear that almost any conceivable change will be change for the worse from their point of view : higher taxes , less @entity157 , or possibly both			1
any attempt to do more for other constituencies -- the unemployed , the young -- represents an extra , urgent threat to them			0
that sense of threat radicalizes voters and donors -- and has built a huge reservoir of votes and money for politicians and activists who speak as radically as the donors and voters feel			0
which means the solution to the problems so astutely diagnosed by @entity47 and @entity48 must ultimately be found outside the @entity26 political system -- and will not be solved until @entity26 's rich and @entity26 's elderly become either less fearful or more generous			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			1

@entity219 - ed from *respected* political *observers* says the core problem with government is @entity23
it says @entity23 is extreme , wo n't compromise , is irresponsible , ignores evidence
@entity217 : @entity23 's radicalization is the result of changes in politics and economy
@entity233 : @entity23 voters could lose the most , others fear change in their lives
