-- having established itself as @entity4 's top tablet competitor by going smaller and cheaper , @entity1 will now go head to head with the category - defining @entity7 on its own turf			1
even as @entity13 's new @entity12 challenges the @entity14 for dominance in the small - tablet category , @entity1 ceo @entity10 on thursday introduced a new , 8.9 - inch @entity17			1
that pits the new device , which will ship in late november , against a device with which @entity4 has , thus far , squashed all direct competition			0
no tablet that has tried to match the @entity7 feature - for - feature has gained more than a token foothold in the market			1
so , how do the latest version of the @entity7 and the @entity17 stack up ? because only a few people have gotten their hands on the new device , some questions ca n't be answered yet			2
but here 's a look at what we do know so far : price the @entity14 comes out way ahead on this one , as is to be expected from @entity1 , which has targeted customers looking for the basic features of a tablet but not willing to pay @entity4 's heftier price tag			1
for $ 499 , the cost of the lowest - end @entity7 ( the @entity41 , @entity42 - only model ) , a buyer can get a @entity44 version of the @entity17 with a @entity46 connection on an upgraded cellular network			1
the @entity41 version of the @entity14 comes in at $ 299 , or $ 200 less than the comparable @entity7			1
size while @entity1 obviously closed the gap significantly , the @entity7 still has a bigger screen than the @entity14			1
@entity4 's @entity7 screen measures 9.7 inches diagonally , while the @entity14 is at 8.9 inches			1
that 's less than the difference between the screen sizes on the @entity56 and the larger @entity58 smartphones			0
( there 's speculation the @entity61 will have a larger screen )			0
but competition between @entity4 and @entity1 could heat up on another front if rumors that @entity4 plans to release an " @entity66 " turn out to be true			2
display both tablets feature high - definition screens , although the details vary			1
the @entity7 's " retina display " featured a total of 3.1 million pixels , with a resolution of 2,048 by 1,536			2
by contrast , the @entity14 hd measures 1,920 x 1,200 pixels , with custom features designed to reduce glare and improve color saturation			2
both @entity4 and @entity1 boast that the resolution on their tablet is so sharp that it 's impossible for the human eye to discern individual pixels			1
data plans until now , the @entity14 has been a @entity42 - only device , and some of its new models remain that way			2
but @entity10 announced that the top - end version of the @entity14 hd is available in @entity46			2
the plan is offered at an attractive price of $ 50 a year			0
but that price gets you 250 @entity94 of data per month -- not a lot for a device designed in large part to stream movies and other media			0
it was unclear thursday what the charges will be for going over the allotted data			0
the $ 50 is well under what @entity106 and @entity107 charge for a year of data on the @entity7			0
when the first @entity7 launched , @entity106 offered data plans starting at $ 15 per month , or $ 180 per year , for 250 megabytes of data			0
currently , @entity107 offers a variety of plans , from @entity114 of data per month for $ 20 ( or $ 240 per year ) all the way up to a massive @entity116 per month for $ 80 ( $ 960 )			0
@entity106 offers a @entity117 per month plan ( the same as the @entity14 ) for $ 15 , or $ 180 per year			0
for $ 5 more , customers can get up to @entity120 per month			0
there are obviously lots of permutations of plans customers can seek out for @entity7 , based on carrier and special offers			0
it 's safe to say @entity1 's is going to be less expensive , although it offers a minimal amount of data			1
apps it 's hard to compete with @entity4 's @entity131			1
there are more than 225,000 apps designed specifically for the @entity7			1
many work to take advantage of its display and screen size			0
add the more than a half - million apps that run on mobile devices and you 've got a lot from which to choose			0
@entity1 , of course , likes to play up the movies and books that make up its universe of content ( and the sale of which make @entity14 prices possible )			2
@entity10 lumped together more than 22 million movies , tv shows , songs , apps , games , books , audiobooks and magazines available from @entity1 's store			1
he showcased a few , nice - looking new apps			0
but while the @entity14 runs a modified version of @entity13 's @entity162 operating system , it only runs apps available from @entity1			1
that cuts the number available down to several thousand -- more than enough for many users , but nowhere near what the @entity7 offers .			0

@entity1 's @entity17 goes head - to - head with the @entity7
the @entity14 wins on price , coming in $ 200 less than @entity4 's cheapest tablet
but there are 225,000 apps designed for the @entity7 , a dominating number
both tablets offer high - definition displays
