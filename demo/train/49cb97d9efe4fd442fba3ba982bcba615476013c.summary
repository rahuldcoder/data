@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity0 police have arrested the captain of a @entity6 ship whose passengers and crew had hoped to help lead a @entity10 - bound flotilla aimed at challenging @entity12 's maritime blockade of the @entity14 territory			1
@entity15 , an @entity6 citizen and captain of @entity17 , was asked to report to a police station saturday morning , said @entity19 , an @entity6 who is one of the flotilla organizers			1
a spokesperson with the @entity23 , who was not named per custom , confirmed @entity15 's arrest			0
the reason given was that he had left the mainland without permission and put passengers in danger			0
he will appear before @entity0 prosecutors on tuesday			2
@entity19 added that , in addition to disobeying a police order , @entity15 is being charged with disturbing sea traffic			0
" this is intimidation , " she said			0
" they 're making an example of our captain to stop other boats in the flotilla from trying to sail			0
" his vessel -- which carried 36 @entity6 passengers , four crew members and several journalists , including @entity2 reporter @entity47 -- was intercepted friday by a @entity0 @entity49 patrol vessel roughly 10 minutes after it had departed @entity50			1
the @entity0 authorities were in a standoff with the crew for about three hours , during which activists sang , chanted and waved signs in support of their mission			1
the ordeal took a turn , however , when an inflatable boat carrying an armed @entity0 military commando team told the activists to follow them back to port or face being boarded			0
eventually , the ship returned to @entity0 , where it is now tied up at a @entity0 naval facility			2
four other crew members have been ordered by @entity0 authorities to stay aboard the ship , @entity19 said			1
many other activist passengers have remained on the vessel as well , in a show of solidarity			0
the @entity17 is one of 10 ships that organizers hope to unite to form a flotilla heading toward the @entity78			1
the trip is partially meant to commemorate a may 2010 incident in which @entity12 troops boarded @entity82 , a @entity83 ship filled with humanitarian aid and 700 activists from various countries			2
nine people died in subsequent clashes with @entity12 @entity90 commandos			0
the @entity0 government said friday that it wo n't allow any of the nine other boats in the flotilla to sail to @entity10 because their mission is too dangerous			1
flotilla members accuse the @entity0 government of buckling to pressure from @entity12 's government			1
for their part , the @entity12 have said they are mounting a diplomatic offensive to try to stop the flotilla from setting sail at all			2
on tuesday , the @entity12 government said flotilla participants had threatened to kill @entity12 military personnel should their boats be boarded			2
they alleged that the participants were stockpiling sacks of sulfuric acid on boats to be used in the event of any attacks on @entity12 commandos			0
flotilla organizer @entity113 dismissed the allegations as ludicrous , saying : " they see this nonviolent , rag - tag group of ships as such a threat they 're using their entire propaganda apparatus , and their diplomatic and economic clout to try to stop 300 peace activists			0
" the @entity125 -- composed of officials from the @entity6 , @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 -- on saturday issued a joint statement asking " all governments concerned to use their influence to discourage additional flotillas , which risk the safety of their participants and carry the potential for escalation			1
" the quartet added in its statement that it " strongly urges all those wishing to deliver goods to the people of @entity10 to do so through established channels , so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via established land crossings			2
" doing so , the group contends , is the best way to both help @entity14 and address @entity12 's " legitimate security concerns			1
" journalist @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
