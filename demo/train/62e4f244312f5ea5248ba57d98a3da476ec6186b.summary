-- @entity1 , 28 , works at a preschool in @entity3 , where she has lived for the last two years			1
she first moved to the city seven years ago from her home in @entity6 , when she and a friend decided to travel to @entity9 's cultural capital to enroll as students			1
" once you have seen the @entity12 and some of the old buildings you ca n't really compare it to anywhere else			0
" while there she fell in love , and over the following years she was either in the city or planning her next trip there			2
what were your initial impressions on coming to @entity3 ? @entity1 : it 's a very beautiful city , it 's very young and there are always things to do : there 's always a party ; there 's always something going on			1
and that was very different from @entity6 for me -- @entity6 is a very small place and there 's not much going on , but in @entity3 there is so much energy			1
i was expecting something a lot more like @entity37 , a lot bigger			0
@entity3 is one of those places that is not too big , but it 's still a city , so wherever you go you meet different people , it 's not that everyone knows everything about you			1
but it 's small enough so that you can walk everywhere			2
i do n't have a car , and walk everywhere			2
i have been totally immersed in the @entity3 way of life : i 'm married to a @entity3 , i spend all my time with his friends			1
i did n't even know there was an @entity52 newspaper in @entity3 until very recently			2
@entity0 : what has made the city so special to you ? @entity1 : that would have to be all the historic buildings and the architecture , because once you have seen the @entity12 and some of the old buildings you ca n't really compare it to anywhere else			1
when you see the @entity12 , it 's breathtaking			0
and there are various places in the city , such as the @entity67 , from where you can see the whole of the city , and it 's beautiful			2
you can just spend ages there , especially if you are an art enthusiast			0
@entity0 : if @entity3 were a person , what would they be like ? @entity1 : they would be a really fun , enthusiastic , very lively and cheerful person			1
@entity0 : is @entity3 a stylish place ? @entity1 : yes , of course			1
all the @entity9 kit themselves out when they go around the center of @entity3 , everyone is wearing the latest fashion -- even the mothers of 50 - and 60 - years old have all got them			1
you get taken along with the current , even though in the beginning you think , " no , i 'm not going to be like them , i 'm not			0
" but in the end you just get taken along with the flow			0
otherwise you just feel underdressed			0
a lot of @entity93 students who come to @entity3 -- and there are lots and lots of students in the center , most of whom are @entity93 -- are a lot less dressy than the @entity9 , and the @entity9 can spot them a mile away			1
@entity0 : is it hard to find places away from the tourists ? @entity1 : oh no. the center is very touristy , but if you travel about a kilometer outside of the center it is actually hard to find someone to who speaks @entity52			1
i live about three kilometers from the center of the city and round there it 's really tough to find someone who speaks @entity52			2
you walk into a bakery and everything has to be said in @entity9			1
also , some of the clubs 10 minutes ' drive from the center are a lot less touristy than the clubs in the center			2
@entity0 : where do you shop ? @entity1 : obviously there are lots of shops in the city , but there are also lots of markets , and many people shop at them			1
i definitely shop at markets because the shops in town are so much more expensive , especially for clothes			0
and they 're not just in the center , they 're also on the outskirts as well , which tend to be cheaper , because the ones in the center can rip you off if you 're a tourist , or if you look like one			0
@entity0 : could you describe a typical @entity3 's weekend ? @entity1 : on saturday morning they would go for a walk into town and have a look at all the shops in the center			1
and then the @entity9 are very fond of aperitifs before they go out , and lots of the bars have these aperitifs put out			1
one of the bars in town is called @entity157 and a lot of people go there and have their cocktail and their little things to eat , sausage rolls , crisps and all the different little things			0
then they would go onto a club , a really good one is called @entity168 , it 's in the south of @entity3 , a ten minute drive from the center , and it 's a really nice club			2
you can have dinner , watch a show with comedians , live singing and dancing , and then it turns into a club after about 12.30			0
on sundays , lots of the @entity9 people , if it 's nice weather , like to go for a drive in the @entity185 region : it 's beautiful			2
they might stop for lunch in one of these very quaint little restaurants			0
if it 's terrible weather they can go to the big shopping center , which is called @entity195			0
sunday nights are very popular nights to have an aperitif , as well			0
it 's a big student town , and thursday night is a big night to go out as well			0
well , in the city center any night you can find people going out			0
there is constantly something going on			0
