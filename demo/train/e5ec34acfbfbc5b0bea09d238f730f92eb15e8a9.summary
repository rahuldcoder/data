-- for some time , sugary soft drinks have been under attack as a major contributor to the obesity epidemic plaguing the nation , if not the world			0
as a result , sales of regular soft drinks have been dropping			1
apparently , sales of diet soft drinks have taken even more of a hit			1
so it comes as no surprise that @entity15 is planning to launch a new ad campaign defending -- and promoting -- its diet soft drinks			1
the ads are going to focus on the safety of artificial sweeteners , or aspartame , in diet soda			1
@entity15 must believe that some of the fall in sales is due to concerns over the health effects of artificial sweeteners			1
here 's the thing : there 's a lot of science out there , and it 's hard to say that aspartame holds much of a health risk			1
@entity37 was first approved for use in 1981 , but it was n't until 15 years later that health concerns showed up			2
in 1996 , a research paper showed that there had been a recent increase in brain tumors and hypothesized that this might be due to aspartame			0
mind you , it did n't prove that was so			0
but the potential link was all the media needed to go crazy			0
tv shows , magazine articles , and newspapers all questioned whether the artificial sweetener was safe			2
further work using data from the @entity57 showed that the increase in brain tumors really began in 1973 , long before aspartame was introduced			0
moreover , the increases in incidence of cancer were seen primarily in the elderly , which as a group , was not the major consumer of diet soda			1
a randomized , double - blind , placebo controlled trial showed that aspartame did n't affect memory , behavior or mood			2
and a study published in 2006 followed more than 285,000 men and almost 190,000 women and could n't detect any relationship between aspartame and brain or blood cancer			0
some research has shown that drinking artificially sweetened beverages does n't promote weight loss , or even promotes weight gain			0
more often than not , this is because people wind up overcompensating for the calorie savings they think they 're getting by switching beverages ( think of the person who orders dessert as a reward for having diet soda )			1
but in those cases it 's not the diet beverage that caused weight gain ; it 's dieters ' behavior			1
you can even find people who postulate that artificially sweetened beverages trick the brain into wanting more calories			0
there 's really no proof of that			2
finally , some will claim that diet drinks will cause the brain to release insulin , which can change your metabolism and make you hungry			2
that 's a bit hard to swallow			2
that 's like saying if you ate sugar - dense food that tasted terrible , it would trick your brain into not releasing insulin			1
it 's the pancreas that releases insulin anyway , not the brain			0
the bottom line is that artificially sweetened beverages are safe			0
that does n't mean you should drink tons of them			0
my wife and i limit our kids ' consumption of soda to caffeine - free , diet types			1
but we do n't let our children drink them every day			0
we stress moderation in everything			0
the fact that @entity15 and other companies are seeing sales drop across the board is likely to create a backlash against artificial beverages in general			1
it 's hard to get too upset about that , since our consumption of them was likely too high to begin with			0
but we should n't make the perfect the enemy of the good			0
given a choice between a sugared soda and a sugar - free soda , i 'd rather see my kids choose the latter every time			1
there 's an abundance of evidence that the sugar is contributing to health problems ; there 's not much conclusive evidence that artificial sweeteners in diet sodas are doing the same			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			2

@entity15 is launching a new ad campaign to defend artificial sweeteners in diet soda
@entity169 : it 's no surprise , since sales of diet soda is dropping more than regular soda
he says there 's little evidence to support the idea that artificial sweeteners pose health risk
@entity169 : given a choice , it 's still better to choose sugar - free soda over sugared soda
