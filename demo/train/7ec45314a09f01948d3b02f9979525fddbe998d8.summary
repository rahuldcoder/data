-- it 's supposed to be known as the " @entity2 " but the ugly face of racism returned to haunt @entity6 football once again wednesday			2
@entity8 's @entity7 , the @entity9 midfielder , was subjected to " monkey chants " during his side 's 2 - 1 @entity12 win against @entity14 in @entity15			1
@entity8 is expected to make a formal complaint to @entity17 , the game 's @entity6 governing body , with @entity7 urging for action to be taken following his side 's victory courtesy of two goals from @entity23			1
" a couple of months ago , a friend was playing at @entity29 and he had the same problem , and today with me again , it 's always the same , " he told the club 's official website			1
" i hope they will change it , i hope they will get big sanctions			0
they have to ban them at some stage , they have to ban a club for a couple of years			2
" they do n't know			0
they have to do something about it or they will always continue with it			0
i do n't know why we just have this in football -- in volleyball or rugby , we do n't have it			0
" a few times when i went to the goal and tried to score , i missed it , some of the fans reacted badly			0
it 's always the same - what they say about racism , but they have to stop it now			2
we have to act , i hope that @entity17 will take action			1
i want it to stop			0
" if uefa do n't take action about that , it will continue			2
we always have some guy saying ' we will have it , blah blah blah '			0
" @entity7 went on @entity71 to thanks fans for their support following the incident with thousands retweeting his sentiments			1
he tweeted : " thank you for your support ! hate or racism can not affect me when so many people are showing me love and support on a daily basis ! " i believe in football institutions , i know decision makers will take their responsibilities and show a red card to racism			2
" @entity8 captain @entity89 , who is of @entity91 descent , took to @entity71 to hit out at the abuse and sent a message to @entity17 and the @entity15 government			1
" @entity95 chants again in @entity96 today			0
. we 've all said enough			0
@ @entity17 , @ @entity99 , @entity14 , all eyes are on you now			1
. " @entity17 has vowed to crack down harder on fans which continue to partake in racial abuse			1
in may , the body 's executive committee ratified a 10 - match minimum ban for racial abuse by players or officials			0
at the time , @entity17 general secretary @entity110 stated that the organization 's 53 members should adopt the same measures			1
according to the new regulations , the first sanction for a club whose fans are found guilty of racist abuse will be a partial stadium closure			2
if the abuse persists , then there will be a full stadium closure and a $ 65,000 fine handed out			0
" an association should adopt the same or similar measures , " @entity110 said in may			0
" @entity17 has always acted in a way to try to convince people rather than impose			1
i do n't think you measure the way of fighting against racism in one simple measure and sanction			2
" in august , @entity133 club @entity132 was fined $ 41,000 and ordered to close the north stand of its stadium following racist behavior by supporters during a @entity12 second qualifying round tie			2
@entity17 has been heavily criticized in the past for the way it has punished those found guilty of racial abuse compared with other offenses			2
during @entity147 , @entity146 striker @entity145 was handed a $ 125,800 fine for revealing a betting company 's logo on his underwear after lifting his shirt while celebrating a goal			0
@entity17 also handed out a larger fine to @entity154 following its semifinal defeat by @entity156 in 2009 after @entity157 confronted referee @entity158 after his failure to award the @entity161 club several penalties			1
when it comes to punishment for racism , @entity17 has imposed relatively small fines , which has left the governing body open to extreme criticism			1
back in 2002 , the @entity169 was hit with a $ 29,000 fine after fans abused @entity172 duo @entity171 and @entity173			0
a year later , @entity171 , @entity173 and @entity174 were abused while on @entity172 duty in @entity176 with the host @entity177 being forced to pay a fine of $ 27,000			0
in june 2007 , the @entity180 was punished with a $ 27,000 fine after its fans racially abused @entity172 players during the under - 21 championship finals in @entity184			1
the @entity185 fa was made to pay just $ 16,000 after its fans were found guilty of " displaying a racist banner and showing racist conduct " during the @entity189 quarterfinal tie with @entity190			0
in 2011 , @entity191 's @entity177 was hit with a $ 54,000 fine after @entity172 's @entity192 , @entity171 and @entity193 were racially abused during a @entity147 qualifier in @entity195			1
@entity196 was fined $ 27,000 after its fans racially abused @entity8 's @entity197 during a @entity199 game last april			1
that decision came a full six weeks after the incident and was then frowned upon further , after @entity17 fined @entity8 $ 40,000 for coming out late ahead of the second - half of their last - 16 @entity199 game at @entity204			1
both @entity15 ( $ 39,000 ) and @entity205 ( $ 26,000 ) were fined at @entity147 following problems of racism , but neither country was hit as hard in the pocket as @entity146 striker @entity145 .			0
