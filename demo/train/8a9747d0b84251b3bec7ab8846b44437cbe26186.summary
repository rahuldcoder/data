-- a man who survived the april 2007 massacre at @entity3 says not enough is being done to keep guns out of the hands of people like the shooter even as a jury found the university failed to warn students earlier that a gunman was on campus			1
" as someone who lost a teacher and many friends as a result of the @entity3 massacre , i am gratified by the verdict , " said @entity13 , who was shot four times during the rampage by @entity16			1
a jury wednesday awarded $ 4 million to the families of @entity25 and @entity26 after finding the university should have notified the student body earlier after discovering two people had been found shot to death in a dormitory room on the morning of april 16			1
@entity16 went on to kill 30 more people at @entity34 , home to the university 's @entity35 and @entity37 , after chaining the doors closed			2
he also wounded 17 people , including @entity13 , before killing himself			1
two years before the shooting rampage , a judge deemed @entity16 a danger to himself due to mental illness , which should have disqualified him from buying a handgun under federal law			1
" we have @entity48 representatives and many state legislators who have failed since @entity3 to keep the mentally ill and other dangerous people from easy access to guns , " @entity13 said			2
in the aftermath of the shooting , @entity13 went to work as a gun control advocate , calling for among other things stronger measures that keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. " it 's outrageous that in @entity63 people sell guns without background checks and with no questions asked			2
" @entity16 's mental health status should have been noted in the @entity68 , a database of people disqualified from gun purchases			0
but , in @entity16 's case , his mental status never went in the system			0
the reason : the federal government relied on @entity77 to provide the information , and @entity77 law disqualifies someone from buying firearms only if he has been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital			0
@entity16 was ordered to undergo outpatient treatment , but he was never committed			0
@entity16 bought one of the guns he used in the massacre online from an out - of - state dealer , picking it up after background checks were complete from a @entity91 , @entity77 , pawn shop			0
he bought his other pistol from a @entity94 gun dealer a month before the shooting .			0

@entity13 was one of 17 people wounded in the shooting rampage
a jury found the university was *negligent* in the shooting rampage
the jury awarded $ 4 million each to two of the families of those killed
@entity13 says he is " gratified by the verdict "
