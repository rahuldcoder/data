@entity0 -- we live in a three - speed economic world , according to the @entity4			1
nations that enjoy the fastest growth include @entity7 , @entity8 and other emerging countries			1
moving at a moderate pace are the @entity11 , finally seeing the light at the end of the 2008 financial crisis tunnel , and @entity15 , riding a resurgence thanks to prime minister @entity18 's vow for a 2 % inflation target			1
but economic growth across most of @entity21 is still growing at a crawl			1
earlier this month , @entity4 managing director @entity23 , said this current three - speed world is setting up financial imbalances that could pave the way for future crises			2
and just this week , against this backdrop of divergent growth rates , the @entity4 cut world economic growth for 2013 from 3.5 % to 3.3 %			1
but @entity32 , @entity4 chief economist , told @entity1 's @entity33 that there is reason to be hopeful			1
" the reason to be optimistic is to look at what has happened in the @entity11 for a while , the question was ' where is growth going to come from ? '			2
and what you see is nearly 100 flowers blooming , " @entity32 said			0
" people are becoming more optimistic			0
the fact that there was no housing construction means that we do n't have enough houses , so housing is doing well			0
" a recent report by @entity57 says @entity11 home prices are slowly returning to normal , with a prediction that average home prices will rise an average of 3.3 % through september 2017			1
@entity11 unemployment fell to 7.6 % in march , its lowest since december 2008 , although much of the fall that month was attributed to attrition in the number of people looking for jobs			2
the question , adds @entity32 , is how @entity21 can stage a @entity11 - style recovery despite a crisis in confidence across much of the continent			2
record unemployment in the eurozone -- at 12 % in february -- means about 19 million people are jobless			0
nearly one in four of those unemployed are under 25			0
" if you look in @entity21 -- in particular core @entity21 -- what you see is people do n't have any hope and so what they do is they do n't spend , and firms do n't invest and banks do n't lend , " said @entity32			2
" and it just feeds on itself			0
now if they had confidence , they would spend more , firms would invest more , banks would do more and we could have growth			0
it can happen but the point is how do we make it happen ? " @entity32 says the only tool that remains is monetary policy -- a cut to interest rates			1
yet , despite warnings from @entity4 chief @entity23 and prominent @entity11 economist @entity99 , the @entity97 has left rates unchanged since july 2012 , with the benchmark rate standing pat at 0.75 %			1
" we have to use all the tools we have , " said @entity32			0
" the tool which remains is monetary policy			1
has it gone too far ? i do n't think it 's too far			0
there are some risks associated ... but my sense is the benefits far exceed the risks or the cost			0

@entity4 says world economies are separating into three different speeds
@entity7 , @entity8 growing fastest , @entity11 and @entity15 have moderate growth , @entity21 slowest
in april , @entity4 cut global growth forecast from 3.5 % to 3.3 % for 2013
@entity4 chief economist still hopeful , says best tool for @entity21 is monetary policy
