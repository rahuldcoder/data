@entity0 -- a bipartisan group of senators announced an agreement on a student loans package thursday that would cap rates , ending a standoff that lasted months and broke through a july 1 deadline for finding a solution			1
under the compromise measure , undergraduate students would pay a rate of 3.85 % next year on subsidized and unsubsidized @entity14 loans			0
the plan would cap rates on loans to undergrads at 8.25 % , for graduate students at 9.5 % and parents at 10.5 %			1
" while this is not the agreement that any of us would have written , and many of us would like to have seen something quite different , i believe we have come a very long way on reaching common ground , " sen. @entity21 of @entity22 , the @entity24 whip in the @entity25 , said at a press conference thursday			1
sen. @entity33 , the @entity24 chairman of the committee that oversees federal education programs , also was present in announcing the deal			1
the @entity38 senator had resisted for weeks agreeing to a plan unless it included caps on how high the interest rates on the loans could rise			1
rude awakening for grads speaking after thursday 's news conference , @entity33 said lawmakers may revisit the student loans issue when his committee wades into altering the @entity50 in the next several months			1
even as @entity33 praised the deal , he said he might reopen it as early as next year			2
" can we change it ? sure we can change it , " @entity33 told reporters			2
" this is not the @entity58 written in stone for @entity61 's sake			0
" " if we do n't pass a @entity50 at least there is certainty in the future			0
if we pass a @entity50 , we might want to leave it the same we might want to change it a little bit			0
i do n't know , " he continued			0
sen. @entity70 of @entity71 called it a " win - win for both students and taxpayers			0
" " tying interest rates to the market allows students to take advantage of historically low rates while ensuring taxpayers will not have to foot the bill for arbitrary rates set by @entity84 , " he said			0
student loan rates doubled july 1 from 3.4 % to 6.8 % after @entity84 failed to reach a deal averting the increase			2
the agreement , if approved by the full @entity25 , would tie interest rates on a variety of government - backed loans to 10 - year treasury notes and would lock in surcharges paid to the government for administrative costs			1
senate majority leader @entity95 said the upper chamber would vote on the deal " as quickly as possible			1
" the @entity99 , which has been heavily involved in negotiations , backs the agreement , a @entity25 @entity24 leadership aide said			2
opinion : @entity102 repeats strategy in student loan fight			0
