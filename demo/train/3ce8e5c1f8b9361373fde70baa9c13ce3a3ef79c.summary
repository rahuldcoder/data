@entity0 -- when he won re-election by a landslide last year , @entity3 's calling card became the @entity6 who can get @entity9 votes			1
this week , the @entity11 governor travels to three blue states -- @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 -- to show @entity6 gubernatorial candidates how it 's done			1
it 's a busy travel schedule that comes as government sources say they have no evidence so far that @entity3 was personally involved in last year 's @entity21 scandal			2
the governor has long said he had no previous knowledge of the plot to close down access lanes to the country 's busiest bridge out of apparent political retribution			0
" you 're always grateful to hear that the things that i said appear like they 're going to be confirmed , if these reports are accurate , " he said during an " ask the governor " radio program on thursday			0
the @entity35 of the @entity6 historically is to have an establishment candidate in waiting -- someone who came close before but lost , like @entity38 and @entity39 , or someone who captures the money and momentum early on , like @entity43			0
that has n't happened so far in the 2016 presidential cycle , which has allowed @entity3 to remain viable			2
still , it 's not as if the bridge scandal ever stopped him from preparing a potential 2016 @entity50 run			1
he 's been getting in better shape since he had lap - band surgery in february 2013			0
@entity6 sources confirm to @entity1 that @entity3 has lost 85 pounds			1
he revealed that at a private fundraiser hosted by key @entity6 donors including @entity57 , the @entity54 first reported			2
in fact , @entity1 is told @entity3 discussed his weight in response to a donor 's question about his health			0
@entity3 has largely taken questions and jokes about his health in stride			0
at an event in @entity11 with @entity39 earlier this month , @entity3 played along as the 2012 @entity6 nominee recalled a story about how he prepared a large meal for @entity3 recently , only to realize the governor was trying to lose weight			1
" i brought out all this food and put it out in front of the table , " @entity39 said			0
" and @entity3 sat there and picked at a couple pieces of lettuce			0
" still , it 's @entity3 's political prep that is most telling			0
he has been using his platform as chairman of the @entity84 to travel around the country and campaign for candidates on the ballot this year			1
it 's a job that also lets him meet people who could be helpful in any presidential run , especially the early contest states of @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			2
despite the bridge scandal making headlines not long after @entity3 became chairman , the governor has still raised a whopping $ 75 million for the organization			1
how to campaign without campaigning he 's also going to key swing states such as @entity104 and @entity105 , as well as some red states such as @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 -- where the @entity11 governor could use some get - to - know - ya time			1
but along the way , he has seen firsthand evidence of conservative skepticism about the @entity11 governor 's ideology			1
the group @entity119 , for example , spent money on negative ads in @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 as @entity3 was visiting the states			2
the ads blasted @entity3 for appointing liberal judges to the @entity124			0
another potential problem for @entity3 - especially among the fiscal conservatives in his party , is that @entity11 's credit rating has been downgraded eight times since he became governor in 2010			1
@entity3 aides argue the reasons for the downgrading go back to fiscal decisions made before he was elected governor five years ago			2
but for fiscal conservatives looking for a presidential candidate who can get the country out of debt , it could be a deal breaker politically .			0

@entity3 has lost 85 pounds as he gears up for a possible @entity50 run
the @entity11 governor has traveled to *28* states in the past year
