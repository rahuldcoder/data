the @entity9 began shadowing the @entity14 - flagged vessel may 19 before the @entity8 reversed course and began heading toward the @entity6 coast			1
" we can not be sure what the pirates ' plan was if they had not been interrupted , " said rear adm. @entity17 , commander of the @entity11 task force			2
" the vessel may have been on its way to either assist other pirates in distress , or look for another merchant vessel to attack , " he said			0
the @entity8 was last been seen off the coast of the @entity6 town of @entity30 , a known pirate haven , but its exact location was unknown until @entity9 positively identified it			1

the @entity9 had initially requested to board the ship to check on the crew			0
the @entity8 denied it had been taken over , saying it was having mechanical difficulties			0
eventually , crew members radioed back saying they had been taken hostage by heavily armed pirates , officials said			0
the @entity8 has a crew of 24 from @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and the @entity54 , officials said			1
@entity56 , @entity57 , commanding officer of @entity9 , said he tried to ensure the safety of the crew first			0
