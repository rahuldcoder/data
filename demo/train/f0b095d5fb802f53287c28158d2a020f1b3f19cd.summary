-- the @entity1 is holding a summit this week in @entity3 on global sustainable development , but , incredibly , family planning is not on the agenda			1
how can the summit ignore this elephant in the room ? when the world 's population hit 7 billion in october , experts warned that if nothing is done , the global population could grow by another 3.5 billion by 2050			0
still , many of the world 's women are without the resources to plan their families ' growth effectively -- a major factor in stemming the tide of global population expansion			1
clearly , the world 's growing population and the significant challenges it poses must be central to any discussion of sustainable development at the @entity1 @entity29 , also called @entity30 , taking place wednesday , thursday and friday			1
negotiators hammering out the terms for discussion in @entity30 failed to link the summit 's sustainable development goals to the concerns , needs and desires of women worldwide -- particularly to the role that family planning could play in easing the burdens posed by population growth			1
we know that when women have access to voluntary family planning services , supplies and information , society sees enormous gains in each of the three pillars of sustainable development -- human development , economic growth and environmental sustainability			1
without it , families , communities and natural resources are extraordinarily burdened			0
experts estimate that more than 215 million women around the world want to delay or space childbirth but are not using modern contraception			1
in fact , meeting this need would cost $ 3.6 billion per year , a small amount when you consider the enormous benefits			0
providing modern contraception also has the potential to stem population growth and relieve human pressure on the environment and natural resources			2
we urge governments and global agencies at @entity30 to make this a priority			0
we are at a moment in history where we still have time to make a difference			0
it is essential that the global discussion in @entity30 not be blind to the potential solutions that access to voluntary family planning could offer to many of the world 's problems			1
our goal is not to control the population : it is to empower women and families , giving them a say over when they will bring another child into this world			2
we know that when a woman can plan the size of her family , she is healthier , more likely to finish her education , join the labor force , become more economically productive and engage in politics , thus more effectively shaping the future of her family and her country			0
we also know that when governments invest simultaneously in voluntary family planning , public health and education , countries can benefit from the " demographic dividend " seen in the @entity117 countries			2
frustratingly , instead of recognizing these links , @entity30 negotiators so far have sidelined them			0
every second , every day , every year we fail to address demand for reproductive health and family planning services			2
lives are lost and girls ' opportunities to thrive and contribute to their country 's development shrink			0
we know that universal access to voluntary family planning services would prevent 150,000 maternal deaths and 25 million abortions every year			1
this is an issue all governments and negotiators should agree upon if we are serious about sustainable development			2
today , opposition to voluntary family planning can only be attributed at best to outdated thinking , and at worst to a desire to undermine women 's rights			1
if the motto of the @entity30 conference is to be realized , that is , to build " the future we want , " leaders must step up and call for universal access to reproductive health and voluntary family planning for women everywhere who are denied this right			1
consider the wider benefits to our planet			0
providing women with the desired cost - effective , low - tech family planning services would not only dramatically reduce pressure on natural resources , increase supplies of food and water , decrease the risk of conflict over other scarce resources and improve ecological health , but scientists estimate such services would cut carbon emissions by up to one - quarter of what 's needed to slow climate change -- an outcome equal to ending deforestation around the world , or increasing 40-fold our reliance on wind power			1
my 15 colleagues and i on the @entity180 , most of us former national leaders , call on our fellow leaders and negotiators not to ignore the elephant in the room			0
they must find the political will to make reproductive health fundamental to implementing sustainable development as a major outcome at @entity30			2
at stake are the very goals the conference is meant to embrace			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity196 .			0
