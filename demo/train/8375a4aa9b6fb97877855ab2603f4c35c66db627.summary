-- " rethinking grid dependence in new climate reality			0
" that was my sole tweet in the aftermath of @entity7 , sent after four long nights with my wife and daughter in our cold , dark living room , cut off from the infrastructure -- and the people -- that normally keep us going			1
indeed , in a reality where charging a cell phone requires finding a friend who not only admits to having power but also agrees to let you come over and plug into it , the relationship of self - sufficiency to community resources takes on a whole new meaning			1
and it reflects not only the core themes of the election , but also the main conceptual challenges facing our society at the dawn of the digital age : do i depend on the collective , or do i go it alone ? ' insane , ' ' inspiring ' @entity36 polling places in @entity7 's wake in the hard - hit areas of @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and the unlucky suburbs , people who had their own generators , supplies , and wood stoves fared better than those of us depending on downed wires , closed supermarkets , and electrically ignited furnaces for power , food , and heat -- at least for a while			1
some offered extension cords from their homes , or even a spot on the floor to sleep			0
others nodded in acknowledgment when they heard of our misfortune , but offered no help -- as if they did n't understand that we were suffering from more than the inconvenience of no cable tv			1
their quizzical looks seemed to say , why should their own success -- but for the grace of @entity71 , in many cases -- obligate them to help others ? @entity75 : @entity76 still fighting for those who are hurting this all changed soon enough , when they lost the ability to find gasoline to power those generators , ice to keep the food cool , or dry firewood to burn			1
then they were out scavenging for resources like the rest of us			2
in my little world of media and technology , self - sufficiency had more to do with having chosen to keep copies of all of my work files , computer programs , and entertainment right on my own devices rather than depending entirely on the miracle of cloud computing			0
this meant that when my family finally evacuated our frigid home ( turns out fireplaces do n't make much heat ) , we could bring my book drafts and my daughter 's @entity110 movies along with us			1
i 'm no doomsday prepper , but i have always had reservations about relegating my files to the servers of others			0
when we finally arrived at the closest open hotel room to our home in @entity36 's suburbs -- it was downtown @entity121 -- we did n't bother with any of our technology , anyway			1
my daughter was excited to see and play with other kids -- families relocated by @entity125 from devastated parts of @entity45 , arriving at the hotel with dogs , hotel vouchers , and printed @entity131 maps			0
now that i was in a hotel lounge with working @entity133 , i really did n't care anymore about whether my work was getting done , or whether i could dazzle my @entity136 followers with any insights or witticisms about this whole mess			2
i did n't care about the election or about the @entity141 , or least of all about e-mails about work			1
@entity144 says help @entity36 restaurants : eat out , tip big instead , i sat in a hotel lounge with working @entity133 , and along with a half dozen dads my age , watched our childhood rock ' n ' roll heroes -- @entity151 , @entity152 , and @entity153 -- perform at a telethon over images that may as well have been our own neighborhoods : fallen trees , crushed homes , families wading through the floods			0
@entity161 came on and did a strange , acoustic version of @entity163			0
there with my fellow displaced @entity7 victims , i realized that i , for the first time , was on the other side of the telethon			1
i was the one " sending out an @entity170 " although i had fared a lot better than the poor denizens of @entity173 or the @entity174 and i was n't going to be seeking a @entity125 reimbursement or need help rebuilding my home , i was still on the victim 's end of the equation			1
i was the person looking to be shared with rather than looking how to share ( or hoard ) what i had			0
with found time to rethink my approach to life and its inevitable disasters , zombie apocalypse scenarios playing out in my head , it became clear to me that the ideological divide @entity190 seems to be facing is a false one			2
those of us needing help were n't lazy or weak , and those in a position to provide it were able to do so only by virtue of collective resources			1
opinion : @entity200 , i 'll miss you the only home generators that worked all week , for example , irrespective of the long lines at the pump , were the ones that used natural gas , itself the product of the energy grid			0
the men getting in fights over the few available gasoline generators being sold out of the back of trucks at the local @entity216 ( as a 125 - pound intellectual , i did n't stand a chance ) may have proven their muscle , but ended up with at best three hours of heat before they went in search of nonexistent fuel			2
see , what we used to call the commons -- the resources and technologies used by everyone -- are what make individual success even possible			1
a shared resource like the @entity232 may allow great entrepreneurs to break from the pack to achieve wild success , but they need to continue to invest in the commons , not as a form of charity or penance but as a self - interested strategy for their own sustainability			2
or , put another way , the family that shares its electricity and living room with less fortunate storm victims will have more friends collecting firewood when the lights go out the next day			0
those of us who got hit hard will remember who was there with an open hand , and who was n't			2
as the checkout lady at the @entity263 said to me this morning , " it takes something like this for people to show their true colors			0
" then she added , with a smile , " at least now you know			0
" @entity45 lets @entity7 victims vote via e-mail people who managed to succeed in the crisis employed mixed strategies			1
they did make wise personal preparations -- such as wood stoves instead of ineffectual fireplaces , natural gas generators instead of gasoline ones , a good supply of stored food and water			2
but they also employed ones that showed an awareness of the need for infrastructure , the importance of longer term thinking , and the strength of community			0
our political parties make it out to be an irreconcilable distinction , as if @entity190 had to choose between one path or the other : greed or compassion , liberty or communism			0
but there is no choice			0
we do not choose between our personal success and our collective welfare			1
we do n't get one without the other			0
the storm that broke records -- and hearts the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity308 .			1

@entity308 : @entity7 's aftermath points up something about election issues
" do i depend on others , or go it alone ? " is false *dichotomy* , he says
he says those needing help were n't lazy ; those providing it did it from collective resources
@entity308 : personal success needs concern for collective welfare
