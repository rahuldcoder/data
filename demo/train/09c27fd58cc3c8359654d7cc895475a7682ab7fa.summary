yet 10 years after his death , he 's survived by the internal frustration and outward animosity that 's long defined relations among and between @entity5 and @entity6			1
so , too , has the violence that 's marred the region for decades			0
recent incidents have stirred fears in @entity5 of a return to 2002 , then in the midst of a second intifada , or armed uprising , when the @entity5 government reported 452 people died in suicide bombings and other attacks			1
on one day alone last week , an @entity5 soldier was stabbed to death on a @entity22 street while three @entity5 were stabbed -- one fatally -- at the same @entity24 hitchhiking post where three @entity5 teens were kidnapped earlier this year			1
this followed several incidents in which drivers ran their vehicles into crowds on busy streets			0
then came tuesday , when two knife - and ax - wielding @entity6 cousins killed four @entity5 worshiping inside a @entity34 synagogue			1
' @entity36 attack ' at @entity34 synagogue so does this all mean a third intifada is coming , if it 's not already here ? no -- or , at least , not yet , according to experts			0
much has changed , they point out , since @entity0 's death			0
it 's harder than ever to get from the @entity24 into @entity5 , especially with explosives and such			1
there has been no call to arms by the @entity6 leadership in the @entity24 ; instead , analysts say , there has been significant cooperation with @entity5 authorities to ferret out potential attackers			1
and there have n't been anything close yet to the coordinated , large - scale attacks in @entity5 like those of the early 2000s			1
as retired former @entity5 national security adviser maj. gen. @entity56 pointed out last week , what 's happening now " falls far from " the first two intifadas , as far as the overall threat to @entity5			1
but one thing that has n't changed is the deep frustration among @entity6			1
now , as was the case over a decade ago , many still harbor steep distrust of @entity5 authorities and diminishing hopes for a political breakthrough			1
" the nature of these movements is that a spark could ignite the tinder , " said @entity67 , the head of the @entity70 ' @entity69 program			0
" ... and once it starts moving , you have no idea where it 's going to go			0
" @entity5 troop kill @entity6 man in @entity24 clashes voids in @entity6 hope , leadership @entity0 is still considered a hero among many @entity6 , as the scenes around the @entity24 commemorating his death november 11 showed			1
this was a man , according to his supporters , who stood up to @entity5			1
this was a man who rallied @entity6 to fight			1
this was a man who got leaders around the world to buy into the idea of an independent @entity6 state			1
@entity99 cancels @entity0 memorials after bombings , blames @entity102 not only is there no more @entity0 , but the idea of a unified @entity6 front is a thing of the past as well			2
@entity0 's former group , @entity99 , now controls the @entity24 under @entity109 president @entity108 , while rival @entity102 is in charge of @entity112			0
" you have an unprecedented division , " said the @entity114 's @entity113 , contrasting that to what he views as @entity5 leadership that 's become more conservative and less willing to compromise			2
" it 's a much weaker leadership than we 've ever seen			0
" the lack of a unifying figure , like @entity0 , has led to a " complete alienation of the people from leadership , " said @entity127 of the @entity128 in @entity34			0
not only do n't they have a person to rally around , there 's no clear sense of a workable exit strategy that will end the cycle that makes life difficult for many @entity6			1
" people really have no expectation , no hope , no perspective in terms of there being any chance that comes through a political initiative , " @entity127 told @entity136 from her home in @entity138			0
" so what we have is an outburst of frustration			0
" what there is not , however , is any clear organization in the recent efforts to lash out against @entity5 -- which was unlike , many say , what happened during the second intifada			2
in some ways , that may be more frightening -- because instead of dealing with a known threat or plot you can unravel , only the attacker may know what will happen next			0
" this is a huge problem because there is no intelligence , " @entity56 told reporters on a call coordinated by the @entity167			0
" someone is getting up in the morning or going out of the mosque at noon and saying , ' today , i 'll kill some @entity5			2
' " there is no organization behind it , " the former @entity5 national security adviser said , noting that all someone has to do is take a knife from their kitchen and attack			1
" ... i do n't see any measures that can be taken to stop an individual ( like that )			2
" 2 killed , 2 wounded in stabbing attacks on @entity5 @entity5 policies have an impact what 's happening and what 's not happening , if you 're talking about major attacks , is a testament to @entity5 's policies as well			2
a lot has changed since what @entity5 called the " @entity196 massacre , " when a man walked into a seaside hotel in 2002 and blew himself up , killing 30 civilians			2
for one , a wall -- or a fence , depending on where you are along the border -- has been erected between the @entity24 and @entity5 , making it harder for anyone intent on attacking to cross over with explosives or weapons			2
also , @entity5 has a renowned intelligence apparatus that 's had years of practice in rooting out potential attackers			2
this is on top of other policies , like stringent measures restricting citizens ' ownership of firearms			0
and even as it pushes for independence , the @entity109 has quietly become a working security partner with @entity5 authorities			1
behind the scenes , the two sides have coordinated efforts to preemptively go after those who might carry out attacks , not to mention common foes from @entity102			0
" the two have worked together , and it has prevented many terror attacks inside @entity5 , " said the @entity167 's @entity227 , predicting both sides will continue to coordinate even if they are publicly at odds			2
" and it has also brought much more calm			0
" yet as clashes in the @entity24 last week showed , it sometimes does n't take much for things to turn violent and get out of hand			0
and @entity6 do n't live only there and in @entity112			1
many live in @entity5 , including some 300,000 in @entity34 , where there has been recent unrest centered around what @entity242 know as the @entity244 and @entity245 call the @entity244			1
" the fear for @entity5 is that the new terrorists ( will be ) on this side of the fence , " said @entity227			2
violence , bad feelings never went away even then , discontent among so - called @entity252 is not a new thing either			0
in fact , experts say -- from a security situation -- @entity5 appears safer from prospective terrorist attacks than it was 10 to 15 years ago			1
the measures it 's instituted in that time have made it harder for armed attackers to get across its borders and inflict mass violence			2
but according to @entity127 , @entity6 ' frustrations " have become worse and worse over time for a lot of reasons			2
" she says that many feel that @entity5 -- whether through increased settlement activity or clamping down on borders and what she calls collective punishment following attacks -- are putting up obstacle after obstacle in their quest for " normal lives			0
" " people want to take care of their families , get their kids to school , have enough income to live off of , " she said			0
" and then the pressure just builds up			0
that 's why we have these repeated eruptions of anger and frustration			0
" @entity113 , from @entity114 , said more forceful responses by @entity5 to attacks can backfire , reasoning , " when you respond to violence with more repression , you 're going to get more violence			1
" the " primitive assault tactics " now being used against @entity5 -- knives and cars , rather than rockets and bombs -- could help further the @entity6 ' storyline , especially if @entity5 security forces respond " with a heavy hand " as prime minister @entity306 's office promised after tuesday 's synagogue attack , expert @entity297 said			1
" ( such tactics ) help portray the perpetrators ... as people of desperation ; they can claim ' we do n't have better means of disposal , ' " said @entity297 , from the @entity5 - based @entity316			1
" it 's an asymmetric battle militarily of a weaker party against a stronger party			0
" it 's the lack of an end game -- a result that will bring peace , security and happiness to both @entity5 and @entity6 -- that has some especially worried			1
if there 's no political end in sight , what 's to prevent those frustrations from continuing to build ? " it 's probably not going to get a lot worse , and it 's almost certainly not going to get a lot better , " said @entity331 , the director of the @entity333 's @entity332			0
" the best you can say , on both sides , is , ' well , at least we 're not like @entity340 and @entity341			0

stabbings , assailants driving into crowds have *unnerved* some in @entity5
yet experts note that the level of violence does n't compare to a decade ago
@entity5 has taken several measures to *bolster* its security since then
some warn that a lack of hope among @entity6 could spur unrest
