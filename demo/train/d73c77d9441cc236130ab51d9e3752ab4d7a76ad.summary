-- despite the tough economic times , you ca n't just expect to stop lusting after those @entity3 riding boots you 've had your eye on forever , or that your longtime trusted hair stylist is going to suddenly start cutting her prices			1
from hobbies to bake sales to your own web site , there are ways to make extra money in your spare time			1
the fact is no matter how frugally you learn to live , there are still going to be some things you 'll want to splurge on , and that 's okay			0
i mean , this is a recession , after all , not a potato famine			0
you do n't have to give up all your luxuries or switch to low - cost everything ; you just have to get savvier about making extra money for those treats you enjoy			1
but i 'm not talking about getting a second job or really working that much harder ; a true recessionista knows how to make extra cash for little luxuries while leaving plenty of free time to enjoy them , too			1
after the jump , seven ways to make more money without taking a second job ... 1			1
become a focus group participant : an old co-worker turned me on to focus groups about 8 years ago and after i made 75 bucks giving my opinion on a series of coffee ads , i immediately went home , opened the phone book ( remember those ? ) , and called dozens of market research companies to get my name added to their databases for future groups			1
over the years i 've made thousands of dollars telling people what i think about ads , product concepts , packaging , services , and the taste of food and beverages			0
once , i even made $ 200 tasting vodka for an hour			0
talk about easy money ! check the " @entity65 " section of @entity64 for current focus groups in your area , or do an online search for market research recruiting companies and then can call and have your name added to their databases			1
use your blog : if you have a blog -- and who does n't these days ? -- you 're sitting on valuable real estate			1
depending on the size of your readership , you could make anywhere from enough money to buy a magazine and a latte to enough to support your entire family ( á la @entity84 )			2
there are lots of different ways to make money on a blog , from virtual tip jars to product reviews , but the most popular is through running ads. in the past , i 've recruited sponsors directly for a niche blog i used to write , but i currently use an advertising program on my personal blog that basically takes care of everything so all i have to do is post regularly and collect my check at the end of the month			1
free money for writing about my cats and boyfriend and favorite tv shows ! what could be easier ? there are a host of ad programs open to anyone , so do your research to find one that 's right for you			0
sell the stuff you no longer want : when i moved to @entity114 from @entity115 a year ago to be with my long - distance boyfriend , i used the opportunity to unload all the crap i no longer wanted or needed			2
i sold furniture , home goods , clothes , accessories , and my car ( no need for one in @entity125 ! )			0
in addition to hosting a yard sale where i made about 200 bucks for candles , pots and pans and old @entity132 costumes , i used the hell out of @entity64 and @entity134 , both before my move and after i arrived when i realized i still needed to unload quite a bit to fit into my boyfriend 's one - bedroom apartment			1
i honestly do n't miss anything i got rid of ( and ca n't remember what most of it even was ) , and the money from the sales paid a big chunk of my moving costs			2
now that i 'm settled in , i like to go through my belongings each season , selling a few items and making room and money for new stuff , like dresses and cute shoes			2
make money from your hobbies : from hawking your crafts on @entity159 , and selling produce from your garden , to playing piano once a week at a local restaurant , or reading tarot cards at a party , there are innumerable ways to make cash doing the activities you love			0
the key here is to convince yourself you have a product or skill someone else wants and then search out those people or companies who can pay you for them			0
host a bake sale : remember when we were kids and our parents used to make cookies and brownies and stuff for school bake sales to raise money for a new flagpole or air conditioning in the gym ? well , why not do the same thing now that we 're grown - ups and need to raise money for our vacations to @entity193 ? i say get a few friends together , bake up a storm , and then sell your goods at a local market , a festival , or even online at a place like @entity159			1
if you love baking , this is another great way to make money from a hobby ... without inhaling all the extra calories eating the goods yourself ! 6			2
shop and sell : what recessionista does n't like shopping , right ? so instead of giving it up or cutting back , start making money off your great eye and awesome buying skills			2
whether you live in an area with fantastic sample sales , or a town with the best thrift and antique stores , chances are you 're able to score stuff your recessionista sisters in other parts of the country ca n't			0
so make your next shopping spree a moneymaking one and sell your finds for a profit on @entity134 , or open a vintage shop on @entity159 ( can you tell i 'm a fan of the site ? )			1
pet sit : if you know people with pets , volunteer to watch them -- for a small fee , of course -- the next time they leave town for a few days			0
sure , they could kennel them or hire a professional , but most people feel better when they leave their beloved pets ( not to mention their house keys ) in the hands of someone they know and trust			0
and , hey , if they have cable and throw in a bottle of wine for your trouble , you 'll score a bit of a vacation yourself ... and make money for a pedicure , to boot			0
