@entity0 -- the death of a sixth patient from a @entity5 - like virus comes on the week that marks 10 years since the deadly outbreak hit @entity0			1
reports of the new virus ' spread remind me of a phone call i received a decade ago : " @entity12 , we 're hearing that there might be a case of @entity5 on @entity15 , " said my boss , referring to the tiny island off @entity0 where i live			1
back then i was working for @entity18 , and my colleagues and i had been reporting on the outbreak for weeks from our homes			0
like many businesses at the height of the outbreak of @entity5 , or @entity5 , employees were encouraged to stay away from the office , or any other places where large numbers of people gather			1
still , i remember thinking : what do i do with this information ? how do i defend against what is unknown and unseen ? and is the sniffle i have more than just a runny nose ? when the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) issued its global alert on march 12 , 2003 -- an ominous warning of a " world - wide health threat " due the outbreak of an unknown form of severe pneumonia -- @entity0 became a city under siege			1
those of us living in the city in the months following that alert watched as the disease spread daily , growing from 150 confirmed cases in 10 nations to 8,096 cases in 30 nations -- killing 774 people -- by july , according to @entity36			1
hospitals were overrun , an apartment complex was quarantined , and restaurants and bars in one of the most crowded cities in the world were deserted			2
the disease decimated social conventions : a public service announcement suggested @entity66 - like bows rather than handshakes at business meetings ; signs offered instruction on how to wash hands and proper spitting etiquette			0
money changing hands suddenly took on a new scrutiny			0
catholic priests were forbidden from offering sacramental wine and placing communion wafers in the mouths of the faithful			0
many in this city of seven million turned to wearing masks , a prophylactic against panic yet an unnerving reminder of the life - and - death fights in the city 's medical centers			2
we now know @entity5 started in november 2002 across the border in mainland @entity93 's @entity92 , percolating there until 10 years ago today			1
on february 21 , 2003 , a @entity93 doctor who treated patients with atypical pneumonia in @entity92 in @entity93 checked into @entity0 's @entity97 to attend a wedding			1
the next day , the doctor was admitted to a @entity0 hospital for respiratory failure			1
disease detectives say @entity5 then spread to other travelers at the hotel , who then hopped on jumbo jets and spread the illness around the world			1
at the time , more was unknown than known , which ratcheted fears			0
statistics offered comfort : the numbers were relatively small , we told ourselves , and noted that tens of thousands of people die each year of pneumonia in the @entity116 alone			2
but our emotional lives are n't lived in a realm of statistical truth , as the casino and lottery industries can attest			0
you can tell yourself the odds are far against infection , and farther still against death , and yet -- what 's that tickle in my throat ? @entity131 was driven by the novelty of the disease			0
epidemiologists had a number of false starts on the origin of the disease -- it 's chlammydia penuemoniae ; no , it 's a paramyxovirus -- until it was revealed to be a new strain of coronavirus , the same family of disease as the common cold			0
this did little to salve public nerves , because who has n't come down with a cold ? one day during the height of the outbreak i went to a movie with a friend , and i choked on my drink			0
as i coughed uncontrollably , a couple sitting behind us -- the only other people in the theater -- got up and left			2
the economic and political backdrop of the disease did n't help			0
the @entity36 announcement came just days before the @entity163 began			1
the september 11 terrorist attacks were still fresh in the public psyche , and before the disease was identified many serious questions were being asked whether it was bioterrorist attack			0
@entity0 was already dealing with record high employment , which @entity5 further raised to an unprecedented 8.6 % by june			1
" it 's a general emotional backdrop ; life is not safe , the world is not safe , even the ground under my feet i ca n't count on , " a local counselor told me at the time			2
" people are very , very tired and very insecure			2
" rumors spread faster than the disease			2
the suspected outbreak on my island proved false			0
after the outbreak at @entity184 , an apartment complex where 329 people were infected and 42 killed , city officials went into overdrive to stop a rumor going viral on the internet that entire city was poised to be quarantined			1
a 14 - year - old boy was later arrested for creating a fake news page creating the story			0
most of the sick and dying were city medical professionals -- which made sense , considering they were the ones at the frontline treating the illness -- but that only added to our worries : if doctors and nurses ca n't protect themselves , how can we ? the cost to business was high			2
conventions shut down , tourists stayed away			0
a friend of mine nearly lost his consulting business as he paid office rental space and salaries for three people with no income for three months as clients canceled training sessions			2
the @entity218 estimated @entity5 cost @entity219 and @entity222 economies $ 60 billion in lost demand and business revenue			1
but as the months passed , so did the malady			0
you could see the green sprouts of recovery in the early weeks as people turned masks into fashion statements , embroidering surgical masks with sequins ; other entrepreneurs started selling masks with @entity236 or other cartoon characters			0
on july 1 , 2003 , half a million of the city 's residents took to the streets on the sixth anniversary of the handover of the former @entity244 colony to @entity93			1
ostensibly , the protests were against a controversial new security measure , but the outpouring of support was fueled by frustrations with public officials over @entity5			1
the city 's property market was leveled by fallout from the disease , but anyone who lived in @entity0 at the time ( this author included ) is now kicking themselves for not purchasing an apartment during @entity5 -- the city 's property is now among the most expensive in the world			1
in retrospect , it can be argued that the paranoia of the first few months paid off : @entity5 was identified and stopped with unprecedented speed			1
" it was rapidly contained within less than four months of the initial alert , as a result of an unprecedented level of international cooperation designed to prevent it from becoming established in people , as hiv / aids had done during the 20th century , " professor @entity266 , head of the @entity267 on @entity268 at @entity244 think tank @entity269 , recently wrote			0
still others argue lessons from @entity5 remain unlearned			2
" once the initial dilly - dallying gave way to decisive and swift state action , resources were effectively mobilized against the epidemic and policy coordination was significantly improved , " @entity279 , a senior fellow on global health for the @entity281 , wrote earlier this month			0
" yet many of the measures widely credited for stopping the spread of the virus , such as isolation and quarantine , were only implemented after the virus " had dissipated , he said			0
the cases of a new sars - like virus hitting a handful of people in @entity299 , @entity300 and the @entity244 serves as reminder of the strange days that we in @entity0 lived through a decade ago , and the hope that early detection of these cases will prevent other cities from living through a similar siege .			1

a decade ago on february 21 , the first victim of @entity5 came to @entity0
@entity312 quickly spread around the world , killing 774 people by july 2003
there were 8,096 confirmed cases of @entity5 in 30 nations , according to @entity36
the city of @entity0 was *transformed* as the epidemic unraveled in the city
