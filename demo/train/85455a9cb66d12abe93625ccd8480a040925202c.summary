-- no , some guy named @entity2 on @entity3 did n't win the @entity5 lottery			1
and , no , he 's not really giving anyone $ 1 million of his winnings			1
but that did n't stop a doctored photo claiming just that from becoming possibly the most - shared image in the site 's history			1
in the photo , posted on the social - media ubersite thursday night , a grinning man identified as @entity2 holds up a @entity5 ticket with the correct numbers for the massive $ 588 million jackpot awarded wednesday			1
the caption that went along with it was the stuff of get - rich - quick daydreams : " looks like i wo n't be going to work ever ! ! ! ! share this photo and i will give a random person 1 million dollars ! " and share they did			1
by monday morning , more than 2 million people had clicked in hopes of a windfall			1
the problem , of course , being that the numbers on the ticket were out of sequence -- a tip - off that the image had been doctored			0
and it did n't help when the two holders of actual winning tickets were found			0
neither ticket belonged to @entity2 , although one winner , like @entity2 , is from the @entity43 area			0
the photo , which is the only publicly shared item on @entity2 ' page , had gotten more than 27,000 comments by monday morning			1
more than three days after the original post , some commenters were still oblivious to the hoax			0
" you have given a lot of people hope at a wonderful time of year , what a kind and generous thing to do ! " one user wrote			2
" @entity58 to you and your family ! " but most had taken a harsher turn , ranging from " @entity62 ! @entity62 ! you got us " to angrier fare			0
" what a jerk ... this is fake ! ! ! ! " someone wrote			0
" all i can say is @entity71 ! ! ! ! " the story first gained traction on social media , then took off when the @entity75 published an article friday on the activity surrounding @entity2 ' facebook page			0
a man claiming to be @entity2 ' brother then left a comment on the @entity75 ' site , discrediting the accuracy of the photo			1
" even though most knew it was fake , people hang onto the most slim opportunities for some luck , some hope ... , " wrote @entity85 in the post			0
" i hope people were able to shake it off			0
i 'm sure the vast majority did			0
the idea of someone winning and then sharing in a second lottery is touching			2
too bad ... this was n't the case			0
" @entity100 contacted @entity85 , who told the newspaper his brother @entity102 is a 35 - year - old software engineer			1
he thinks his brother was just seeking attention , according to the paper			0
" i think he craves the love from people , " he said saturday in a follow - up article published by the newspaper			1
" he did this to make himself feel better			0
" @entity2 did not immediately respond to a message on @entity3 on monday seeking comment for this report			2
among the comments on his @entity3 photo were at least dozens that recounted stories of personal hardship , from people with disabilities to tales of children diagnosed with terminal diseases			1
that , @entity85 said in his post , may be where a prank went too far			0
with 2 million - plus shares , the image may be the most - shared item in the eight - year history of @entity3			1
a photo of president @entity133 hugging his wife , @entity134 , posted after his re-election victory last month , received 581,000 shares			2
and @entity3 's most - shared item last year was a @entity139 photo gallery of the @entity141 earthquake and tsunami			1
it was shared about 600,000 times			2
a @entity3 representative did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment .			2

bogus lottery photo shared 2 million times on @entity3
man claimed he had won $ 588 million @entity5 and would share
@entity155 's brother to newspaper : " i think he craves love "
