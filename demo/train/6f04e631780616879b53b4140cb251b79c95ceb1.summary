@entity0 , @entity1 -- as @entity5 gazed down on one of his experiments in what has come to be known as the " holy grail " of energy research , his response was to shrug : " oh , that ca n't be right			1
" it was a glass of tap water with a thumb - sized strip of silicon floating in it			1
when he held the glass up to the light , the strip began to gently bubble			0
it seemed to be splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen			2
but this would mean you could take any tub of water and -- with no more than a few cheap materials and a little light from the sun -- produce two incredibly powerful fuels			2
it could n't be right			2
professor @entity5 went back and , for 8 months , tried to prove himself wrong			1
the artificial leaf : better than nature scientists had split water before			1
by 1870 , electrolysis using platinum electrodes and vast electrical currents could achieve the feat. in the 20th century , too , simpler methods had been developed which used sunlight to power the reaction -- but these , too , relied on prohibitively costly metals			2
@entity5 's " artificial leaf " is different			1
on either side , the silicone strip is coated with inexpensive metallic compounds -- a cobalt phosphate catalyst that spurs the creation of oxygen gas , and a nickel - zinc alloy that does the same for hydrogen			2
the process only uses as much energy as it can pick up from sunlight : in the lab , @entity59 flicks off the light , and the bubbles disappear			1
the reaction was inefficient when first demonstrated in 2008 -- with little of the sunlight being locked up in the fuels -- but today it beats nature at its own game			0
in natural photosynthesis , the process by which all plants take in energy -- and which ultimately provides the fuel for all life on earth -- only very small amounts of solar energy are converted to fuel			0
" the best stuff that grows in the field , a plant , it only fixes 1 % of the light , " explains @entity5			1
" we 're already on 7 %			0
" freedom from the grid " my vision of the world is : if you see some sun , you will be in control of your own energy supply , " says @entity5 , now professor of energy at @entity86			1
first , he 's looking to the developing world where , he says , two drinking bottles of water could provide a household with a steady 100 watt power supply the water would n't even need to be clean : " you find some water on the ground , you put it in , the water circulates over this thing that 's collecting the light just like a solar panel and then it 's splitting into hydrogen and oxygen			1
" anyone could have an artificial leaf device -- which he predicts " will look like dishwashers " -- and produce enough bottled hydrogen and oxygen to power the house through the day and night			1
in the developed world , colossal investment in power stations , pylons and other infrastructure over the last century has guaranteed inexpensive electrical supply for all from the grid -- and he says there 's therefore currently little demand for this kind of personal power station			0
but in the developing world , where many are without connection to such infrastructure , there is a real desire -- if it can be made cheap			0
that 's why @entity5 sees his mission -- now focused on driving down costs -- as more than just an act charity : " you can say i 'm trying to help the poor -- i always say : ' no , the poor are helping me , ' because they can be much more nimble			1
" " they can be the early adopters and teach the world what the future energy system will look like			0
" why it wo n't happen soon today , @entity139 knows he 's not wrong about what he saw in the glass			1
he 's sure he has found the key to turning water and sunlight into high - power fuels , without high costs			1
" i 've found the solution , there 's no question			0
you can take sunlight and water , drop this thing in , and simply split hydrogen and oxygen			1
you ca n't get simpler			0
" so when will we see his remarkable creation on the ground ? " not very quickly , " says @entity5			1
" i tell you what i do n't like about my invention ? i make hydrogen			0
" " @entity164 is the most powerful fuel , but it 's a gas			0
if i gave you hydrogen right now you would n't know what to do with it			0
" for now , he says , he 'll have to work on convincing people to find ways to make hydrogen " fuel cell " technology easy - to - use			2
that , or combine hydrogen with @entity174 to produce the type of liquid fuels we 're more familiar with -- gasoline or diesel -- a process which has seen big advances in recent years			0
still he refuses to get disheartened , and believes it will happen one day : " when you are trying to make a new energy infrastructure -- you better understand that this is n't going to happen overnight			2
" there 's nothing any scientist is going to invent in a lab that will displace hundreds of trillions of dollars ' worth of investment in an energy infrastructure			0
" " it 's got to be a mind - set -- everyone 's got to want it			0

@entity5 has created the " artificial leaf "
the low - cost device can turn water and sunlight into *stored* energy
it has long been *dubbed* the " holy grail " of energy research
find out why you wo n't be getting your hands on it *anytime* soon
