if you have your heart set on white flowers , gardenias make attractive holiday decorations			1
a single stem can run about $ 10 , so buy the entire plant , which could have 10 to 12 blooms , from a nursery for around $ 25			0
if you 're feeling crafty , head to a nursery that sells @entity88 trees			1

@entity0 : spend money to save money save on a tree tips from an anonymous @entity88 - tree seller yes , you may be in a hurry to start decorating your @entity107 fir , but do n't forget to negotiate a good price first			1

if it arrived before december 10 , that evergreen might not make it through @entity117 's			0

also consider buying bottles from somewhat less prestigious wine - growing regions , such as @entity161 ; @entity162 , @entity163 ; and @entity47 's @entity164			2
these wines are priced up to 50 percent less than their more famous counterparts			0

send it ground -- it still might arrive on the following day			1
