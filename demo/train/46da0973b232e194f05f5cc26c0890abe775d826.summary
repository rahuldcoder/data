@entity0 -- his party got its clock cleaned in tuesday 's midterm elections , but president @entity6 still remains competitive in some hypothetical 2012 presidential election matchups , especially against @entity8 , a new poll shows			1
a @entity11 survey released thursday also indicates that at the unofficial start of the race for the @entity15 presidential nomination , the field of possible contenders appears wide open with no front - runner			1
twenty - one percent of @entity15 say they would most likely support 2008 @entity15 @entity20 candidate and former @entity23 gov. @entity22 for their party 's 2012 presidential nomination , according to the poll			1
the number is 20 percent for another 2008 @entity15 presidential hopeful , former @entity29 gov. @entity28			1
fourteen percent say they support @entity8 , the former @entity31 governor and 2008 @entity15 vice presidential nominee , with 12 percent backing former house speaker @entity33 of @entity34			2
the remaining candidates , whose names were all in single digits , are led by rep. @entity38 of @entity39 , who also ran for the @entity15 presidential nomination the last time around , followed by @entity42 gov. @entity41 , @entity44 gov. @entity43 , rep. @entity45 of @entity46 , and former sen. @entity47 of @entity48			1
the poll 's release comes as @entity47 visits @entity51 to give a speech about the midterm election results and the future of the @entity15			0
no one has yet to announce a bid for the @entity15 nomination			2
in a possible general election showdown , @entity6 leads @entity8 52 - 44 percent among all registered voters			2
" looking ahead to 2012 , it may be too early to count @entity6 out , particularly if @entity8 is his opponent , " said @entity1 polling director @entity60			2
" the former @entity31 governor gets a lot of attention , but she is in third place when republicans are asked to pick a presidential nominee , and in a hypothetical matchup with @entity6 she is arguably the weakest candidate of the top - tier @entity15 hopefuls			1
" in a hypothetical 2012 matchup , @entity22 leads @entity6 52 - 44 percent , while @entity28 has a 50 - 45 point advantage , which is within the poll 's sampling error			1
@entity6 holds a 49 - 47 percent margin over @entity75			0
the poll indicates that four in 10 have a favorable opinion of @entity8 , with nearly half saying they have an unfavorable view			0
@entity28 has a 36 percent favorable rating and a 29 percent unfavorable rating , with 35 percent unsure			0
forty - two percent say they see @entity22 in a positive light , with 26 percent saying they hold a negative view and just over three in 10 are unsure			0
@entity75 has 32 percent favorable rating , with four in 10 saying they have an unfavorable view , and 28 percent unsure			0
on the @entity90 side , nearly three - quarters of @entity90 say they want to see the party renominate @entity6 in 2012			1
why does that matter ? " no incumbent president has faced a significant primary challenge and gone on to win re-election in november , @entity60 added			0
" contested primaries make incumbents look weak and overly - political , and prevent the incumbent from building up goodwill while the opposition party candidates are fighting among themselves			0
" avoiding a primary challenge wo n't guarantee @entity6 victory in november 2012 , but the fact that 73 percent of @entity90 want to see the party renominate @entity6 may scare off any democrats who are contemplating a run against him , and that gets him one step closer to a second term			1
the poll of 1,006 adult @entity113 , of which 921 were registered voters , was conducted by phone october 27 - 30 , before the midterm elections			0
the sample also included 500 respondents who describe themselves as @entity15 or independents who lean @entity15 , and 453 respondents who describe themselves as @entity90 or independents who lean @entity90			2
