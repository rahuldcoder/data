-- there once was a time -- like , oh , the late 1990s -- when the box set loomed over the music world like a just reward			1
with dazzling presentations -- 3 - d brains ! lucite cubes ! portable faux - phonographs ! -- and equally unrestrained liner notes , these @entity9 collections were the ultimate capstone to an artist 's career or the last word in genre compilations			1
and then , they faded away			0
not entirely , of course			0
but in an @entity22 - dominated @entity21 world faced with declining cd sales -- and fewer artists and genres left to mine -- the box set ( or boxed set , if you prefer ) now takes a back seat to ipods and singles			1
who has time to get immersed in a 6 - cd collection of greatest hits , choice cuts and outtakes ? it 's almost as quaint as reading a book , for @entity41 's sake			2
but the box set is n't dead yet , and each year brings a number that are as lovingly prepared and painstakingly presented as the classics of yore			1
here are seven that are worth your while this season			0
" @entity49 , " @entity51 ( @entity50 , 5 cds , 2 lps , 2 45s ) it was 1966 and @entity55 was going to outdo " @entity57 , " the @entity51 classic released in may of that year			1
he had a vision of an album that would summarize the @entity61 journey			0
with lyrics provided by @entity63 , @entity55 worked over his songs endlessly , trying to harness the sounds running through his head			0
in the end , it was too much ; around may 1967 , he pulled the plug			0
the end of " smile " was the end of a chapter for @entity55 and the @entity51 : they would never attempt to scale such musical heights again			1
but the album refused to go away			0
@entity76 put out versions , and @entity50 released about 30 minutes on the @entity51 ' 1993 box set			1
@entity55 himself revisited it for a 2004 solo album			0
now comes the original recordings , showcasing song progressions , studio chatter and those gorgeous @entity51 harmonies on such songs as " @entity87 , " " @entity88 " and " @entity89			1
" the deluxe box includes vinyl , archival photographs and other " smile " - related material			1
the greatest unreleased album of all time ? you be the judge			0
" @entity98 presents the @entity99 , " @entity100 ( @entity102 / @entity101 , 7 cds ) what sound was @entity55 pursuing ? it was @entity98 's @entity106 , that echo - y , mighty mass of music that spilled through am radios like the voice of heaven itself			2
undergirding it all was the @entity113 , the band of @entity115 session kings ( including drummer @entity116 , guitarist @entity117 and saxophonist @entity118 ) who never let up on the beat			0
this set presents the original albums from the @entity122 , the @entity123 and @entity124 and the @entity125 , with an extra disc of label sides for good measure			0
" nevermind " @entity130 edition , @entity131 ( @entity132 , 4 cds , 1 dvd ) sometimes the changing of the guard is as obvious as the progressions of no. 1 singles on the billboard charts			2
in early 1964 , @entity141 's " there ! i said it again " gave way to the @entity143 ' " @entity145 " on the singles chart and , just like that , the @entity142 dawned			2
similarly , on january 11 , 1992 , @entity153 's " @entity152 " was knocked out of the top spot on the album chart by three scruffy lads from @entity150 , and the indie - grunge gold rush was on			2
the @entity130 edition of @entity131 's 1991 classic includes the original album as well as studio outtakes , live cuts and -- most interesting of all -- @entity160 's original mix. " @entity161 , " @entity162 ( @entity163 , 8 cds ) stop me if you think you 've heard this one before : an amusingly morose lyricist / singer joins forces with a jangly , riff - minded guitarist and a crack rhythm section			1
the four produce several singles with titles such as " @entity176 , " " @entity181 , " and " @entity182 , " top the @entity179 charts for a few years , and then go their separate ways			2
that was the story of the @entity162 , and their four studio albums -- along with three compilations and a live album -- have been remastered by the guitarist , @entity187 , for this box set			2
for the true diehards , @entity163 also has a limited - edition version with cds , lps , singles , posters and wallpaper , yours for $ 499.98			1
" the @entity196 , " @entity197 ( @entity198 , 7 cds , 1 dvd ) the man who helped create jazz with his @entity204 and @entity206 groups has been the subject of several box sets , but considering his career spanned five decades , there 's always more to uncover			1
@entity198 has compiled live performances from 1947 to 1967 , including " 's wonderful , " " @entity211 " and several versions of " when it 's @entity214			0
" ( for those who want an @entity197 primer , @entity215 recommends the import " ambassador of @entity220 , " a 10 - disc collection packaged in a miniature suitcase			2
) " @entity223 : the @entity227 1951 - 1960 , " @entity225 ( @entity226 , 4 cds ) if you want to know where rock ' n ' roll starts , you could easily find yourself at 2120 s. @entity231 in @entity232 , the longtime home of @entity233			1
( it 's now the site of @entity237 's @entity236			0
) among @entity233 ' stars was bluesman @entity225 , better known as @entity225 , who set the place afire with the songs " @entity241 , " " spoonful " and , of course , " @entity223 , " many written and / or produced by @entity237 -- and cornerstones for any self - respecting blues or rock band			1
he was 41 when he first started recording for @entity233 , and he helped make the label the legend it is			0
" this may be my last @entity249 : @entity252 on 45 rpm 1957 - 1982 , " @entity100 ( @entity250 , 3 cds ) so much of the most interesting @entity61 music was done for small labels on the fly ; after all , it 's not as though every artist could afford endless hours of studio time , paid for with big major - label advances			0
some of this material has come in for a ribbing in the cd / internet age -- think about those sites devoted to ugly album covers , never mind the music within -- but several labels have devoted themselves to searching out and mastering these long - lost recordings			1
" this may be my last @entity249 " is a follow - up to " @entity269 in my bones , " a 2009 collection also put together by @entity271 , featuring music straight from the soul .			0
