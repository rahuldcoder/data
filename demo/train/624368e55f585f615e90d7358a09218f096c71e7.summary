seventy - five years after its premiere at @entity4 's @entity3 on december 15 , 1939 , " @entity0 " retains its hold on the popular imagination			1
tourists to @entity4 long to see @entity8			1
( sorry , it does n't exist , though there is a road to @entity12 south of town , not to mention the @entity14 , which showcases the apartment where @entity16 wrote the book			2
) its lines -- " fiddle - dee - dee , " " frankly , my dear , i do n't give a damn , " " tomorrow is another day " -- are still widely repeated and parodied			2
and , in its monumental @entity24 - ness , it 's often held up as the pinnacle of one of the finest years in film history , 1939			1
but the film is also incredibly divisive , partly because of the era it represents -- the @entity31 in the @entity32 -- and partly because of its sheer , over-the - top bulk			1
its racism is particularly unnerving in 2014 , a year in which @entity36 society has grappled with racial unrest over police treatment of african - americans and other issues			1
frankly , we still give a damn here are some reasons to love and hate " gwtw " : love : it 's incredibly faithful to the book this is not a small point			2
the 1936 book -- all 1,037 pages of it -- was a phenomenon of @entity56 proportions and audiences damn well wanted to see every last detail on screen			2
" it is the picture for which mr. @entity65 's @entity64 has reported a palpitantly waiting audience of 56,500,000 persons , a few of whom may find encouragement in our opinion that they wo n't be disappointed in @entity75 's @entity74 , @entity77 's @entity76 or , for that matter , in mr. @entity79 's @entity16 , " wrote the @entity60 in a contemporary review			2
@entity80 : how ' @entity47 ' became @entity36 's biggest blockbuster hate : it 's incredibly faithful to the book the book may have been a huge best - seller , but it was not universally loved			1
other writers disparaged it ; in a 1937 meeting of the @entity36 writers @entity92 , the rank and file voted overwhelmingly for @entity95 ' " @entity94 " as the best book of 1936			2
" @entity47 " got one vote			1
why ? it is sprawling and messy , traffics in clich√©s and is " unforgivingly racist , " @entity98 noted in 2011			2
hate : it 's , well , racist the black characters in " @entity47 " are walking stereotypes of slaves and maids			1
black dramatist @entity105 compared it with " @entity107 , " noting that " @entity47 " was just a quieter vilification of african - americans : a " rear attack " compared with " birth 's " direct approach			1
a " weapon of terror against black @entity36 , " added the @entity112			2
there were demonstrations against the film in some cities , and @entity119 , who won an @entity120 for her performance , could n't even attend the @entity4 premiere with other celebrities because of segregation laws			2
the film 's portrayal of african - americans still troubles -- partly , says @entity129 's @entity128 , because they 're still evident today			2
" there are good blacks and insolent blacks			0
there are house blacks and there are field blacks			0
whenever @entity140 - @entity36 characters are articulate , it is always meant as a comic surprise , " he writes			0
" these are still the prejudices that bedevil representations of african - americans on screen			0
" love : it showcases a modern woman @entity149 may live in the 1860s , but as many critics have observed , in her determination and independent spirit , she 's still relatable today -- and she was exceptional in 1939			0
after all , this was a passionate woman who married three times , had her own business and -- despite being left alone at the end of the film -- refuses to wallow in her abandonment			0
" tomorrow is another day , " indeed			0
watch rare footage from the premiere love : it 's the peak of @entity24 filmmaking with its gorgeous photography , scene - grabbing acting , swelling @entity170 score and overall operatic pitch , few films are as @entity172 brilliant as " @entity47 , " and perhaps nothing has matched it since			1
one scene that continues to be talked about decades later is the famous burning of @entity4			0
not only was it one of the most expensive scenes ever shot -- $ 25,000 , an enormous sum at the time -- but it also destroyed the sets for some previous movies , notably " @entity183 , " and prompted some area residents to call the fire department			0
but what emerges is a sense of the grand , tragic scale of the war			0
you can thank inventive production designer @entity192 for much of its success ; he had the idea to burn old sets for the @entity4 fire scene , he used color filters to highlight mood and he storyboarded the entire film in advance			0
moreover , there 's the passionate but turbulent love story between @entity149 ( @entity75 ) and @entity76 ( @entity77 ) that drives the movie forward			1
" as few @entity36 films have , ' @entity0 ' succeeds both as historical epic and as intimate drama , " wrote the @entity206 ' @entity205 in 1989			1
hate : it was n't even the best film of 1939 the year of " @entity0 " is often touted as the greatest year in @entity24 history , when no fewer than 10 films were nominated for best picture , including " @entity215 , " " @entity216 , " " @entity217 " and " @entity218			1
" of those , " gwtw " took home the @entity120 , but many critics would put the influential " @entity216 , " @entity222 's " @entity223 " or even " @entity224 " ahead of it			0
moreover , though " gwtw " has topped polls of @entity36 ' popular films in the past , including a 1977 @entity229 survey , its popularity may be slipping			0
the epic is currently ranked no. 157 on the @entity232 's top 250 list , surpassed by " @entity233 , " " @entity234 " and " @entity235 " -- and even " @entity236 , " " @entity237 " and , uh , " snatch			0
" ( yes , the @entity239 film			0
) " no one i know of has yet solved the secret of this 1939 film 's apparently timeless appeal , though i 'd guess it has something to do with the elaborate mechanisms of fate , history and sex brought to bear on @entity74 , whose overweening libido must be punished as magnificently as it has been celebrated , " wrote film critic @entity240			1
love : length " @entity0 " lasts 222 minutes -- that 's three hours and 42 minutes -- and many fans wish it were longer			1
when it had its premiere on commercial tv in 1976 , @entity256 ran it over two nights -- and received blockbuster ratings for both broadcasts , with almost two - thirds of the viewing public watching			0
hate : length 222 minutes ? and that does n't include the intermission			0
hate : its effect on history thanks to its enormous popularity , " @entity47 " has been hard to escape -- especially in @entity4 , where @entity16 lived and died			1
and yet its glorification of the antebellum @entity31 is troubling to many critics , who believe it has hampered views of race			0
" we like to think 1939 was a different world , a world divided from our own by a supposedly vast span of progressive enlightenment			0
unfortunately , while 75 years in @entity36 life is enough to constitute several distinct epochs , it 's not long enough to kill off the country 's enduring prejudices , " wrote @entity129 's @entity128			1
" the movie is , in many ways , a repository of the originals that have shaped @entity36 culture 's tortured descriptions of race since			1
" love : it 's still a powerful movie if you depend on movies for a clean , uncluttered and accurate view of history , you 'll be disappointed every time			1
leave the history to the historians ; movies are storytelling , and few stories are as well told as " @entity0			1
" as @entity309 noted in 1998 , " it is still a towering landmark of film , quite simply because it tells a good story , and tells it wonderfully well			0

" @entity0 " opened 75 years *ago* monday
the movie is criticized for racism , celebrated for its filmmaking *bravado*
" @entity47 " remains representative of golden era of @entity24 filmmaking
