@entity0 -- diehard supporters , tourists and the curious swamped pockets of left - wing protesters to bid farewell to former @entity8 prime minister @entity7 in @entity0 wednesday			1
in scenes that echoed the divisions @entity13 drove through @entity8 as she transformed the economy and society during the 1980s , people of all social classes lined the route from the @entity18 to @entity19 's , some to pay tribute , some to condemn and many just to get up close to a spectacular state occasion			1
hours before the ceremony began , the crowds were already five or six deep in some places ; thousands crammed onto the sidewalk alongside souvenir shops and cafes opposite the cathedral -- for centuries a symbol of @entity0 and the site of historic moments in the life of the city , from the @entity38 to the @entity39 of @entity40 and @entity41 to the occupy protests			1
many of the onlookers were smartly dressed , their dark outfits echoing the formal suits of the " official " mourners ; others carried @entity49 , photographs of the " @entity50 " and fold - up picnic chairs , giving the somber occasion a somewhat festive air			1
follow live updates of the funeral of former @entity8 pm @entity7 " i had to be here , " said @entity56 , a child of the @entity13 era , originally from @entity58 in eastern @entity59 , who traveled from his home in @entity61 especially for the funeral			1
he typified the sort of person for whom @entity13 's legacy of free - market economics and individuality had the greatest impact			1
" i was a boy in the 1980s			0
rightly or wrongly , she changed the landscape of the @entity8 forever , and she made me feel i could do anything , " said @entity56			2
" we have n't seen anybody like her since -- on either side of the @entity77			0
" for @entity79 , from @entity0 , who met @entity13 several times in the 1980s while working as a photographer on the local paper in her constituency , @entity8 's first female pm was a huge influence			1
" she was a real inspiration for women -- she made us feel we could achieve anything we wanted to , " @entity85 said			0
fellow @entity0 @entity89 agreed : " she did so much to show women that there is n't a glass ceiling			2
" while the majority of those in the crowds were old enough to remember @entity13 's era well , younger mourners were also on hand to pay tribute			1
" she had a really good attitude and did n't let anything stand in her way , " said @entity99 , who was just four years old when @entity13 left @entity100 for the last time , " i think she 's quite inspirational to people			1
" rewriting history : how @entity8 might have been without @entity13 @entity108 , from @entity109 , said @entity13 " showed the value , the power of ideas			1
she changed the lives of tens of millions of people for the better , she defeated @entity116			0
she changed the world , not down the barrel of a gun but through ideas			0
" but others in the crowd felt @entity13 's 11 years in power had left the @entity8 a less positive legacy			1
at @entity125 on the approach to @entity19 's , a crowd of about 100 protesters waved placards , rainbow - hued " peace " flags and signs reading " @entity132 , " " @entity13 " and " respect is earned in life , not death " as the @entity137 - draped coffin , topped with an opulent arrangement of cream roses , passed by on a gun carriage			1
@entity141 , from @entity0 , was among those waving @entity144 placards reading : " we remember : the miners , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149			2
now bury @entity150 , " a summing up of the coal battles , the @entity152 , a hated tax based on homes and an @entity156 convict who died on hunger strike			0
" i 'm not here to celebrate @entity13 's death , which i think some are , " he insisted			1
" i 'm here because this should n't have been a state funeral			0
@entity164 and others have tried to present this as a moment of state unity , but she 's not a unifying figure -- the ideas she represents are continuing to do great harm to the country			0
" @entity0 's police , well used to running security in a city where the pomp and ceremony of royal and state occasions is a feature of life , had warned protesters to exercise carefully their right to object to what @entity13 stood for			1
turning their backs on the military procession carrying @entity13 's casket was acceptable ; yelling obscenities and throwing objects was not			1
even some of the protesters were of a very @entity8 kind : polite to a fault			1
" @entity195 , but @entity196 is better than @entity197 , " read one sign , carried by @entity194 , from @entity0			2
' hurt and anger ' from @entity13 policies still felt " it 's a protest , but a mild one , " he explained			1
" i really wanted to see the spectacle , i admit that , but i thought if i came , i had to show that i 'm no fan of @entity7			2
i did n't think she warranted such an occasion			0
" many of those who lined the streets in tribute to the @entity210 said they understood that she was a polarizing figure			0
" whether you like someone or not , and whether you like what they did or not , you have to be respectful , " said @entity212 , an activist in the @entity213 that the " @entity50 " led to three election victories			2
" we 're here out of respect -- to us , she was wonderful			0
i accept that not everyone sees it the same way , but it 's the same if @entity224 died			0
i would n't necessarily come , but i 'd expect him to be treated with respect , and i 'd want him to rest in peace			0
" @entity224 led the reformed @entity229 to victory over the @entity213 in 1997 , seven years after @entity13 was unceremoniously bundled out of office in a political coup by her colleagues			2
he was among the mourners at the funeral , a reminder that she saw the adoption of free market economic policies by the rival @entity229 as perhaps her greatest achievement -- an orthodoxy few in the political mainstream challenge despite the banking crisis and a lengthy recession			0
" people have a right to have their say , and they did that on saturday at their protests , but i do n't think you should interrupt people 's grief -- this is a family which has lost their mother , their grandmother , " said @entity56			0
others were clearly angered by the presence of what they saw as an " obnoxious and tasteless " protest , with mutterings of " no respect , " and " put them on the front line ! " spreading through the crowd			0
but one of those demonstrating against @entity13 's legacy , @entity270 , from @entity0 , said he had thought carefully about the wording of his banner : " rip : regulated finance industry , fair taxes , communities , the great @entity8 mining industry , free milk for schoolkids , " because " i did n't want to be insulting or disrespectful			1
" @entity13 : revered and reviled , in death as in life and for the most part , the boos and chants were drowned out by ordinary members of the public who came to bid farewell to a woman who transformed @entity8 and , in some cases , their own lives			1
" we know what the @entity8 was like before 1979 and it was n't pleasant , " said @entity212			2
" i started my own business in the 1970s , and it thrived in the ' 80s -- i credit @entity7 for that			2
" that was a sentiment echoed by @entity296 , a " great admirer " of @entity13 , who moved to the @entity8 from his native @entity297 in 1957			1
" she was just what this country needed			0
before she came along , in the 1970s , it was awful here , they used to call it ' the sick man of @entity306 , ' but she changed all that			0
" the funeral -- officially ceremonial rather than a state occasion in a distinction invisible to all but the most pedantic royal watcher -- was the first for a former prime minister and war leader since @entity316 's body was borne along the same route a generation ago			1
in recognition of her role in the @entity147 conflict with @entity326 in the early 1980s , pall - bearers from each of the @entity8 's armed services carried @entity13 's coffin into the cathedral , having escorted it from the official church of the @entity330			1
retired @entity330 serviceman @entity331 , from @entity332 in southeastern @entity59 , was one of many former armed forces personnel there " to pay my respects to a lady i thought was the greatest prime minister since @entity316			2
" while for many the day was a somber one , for @entity340 , from @entity0 , it was a positive occasion			2
" i do n't really do funerals , but for her , i thought i should come along			0
it feels like a celebration , " she said			0
" it 's like the changing of the guard ; we 've moved into a different season with her passing			0
it 's not a sad occasion -- she had had an amazing life			0
" @entity1 's @entity356 contributed to this report .			0
