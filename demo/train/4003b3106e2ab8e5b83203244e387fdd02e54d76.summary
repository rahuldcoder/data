@entity0 -- the @entity4 administration is working on a substantial sanctions package against @entity6 in case current diplomatic efforts to curb its nuclear program fail , top officials told @entity10 on tuesday			2
treasury under secretary @entity11 also developed some of the existing financial sanctions against @entity6			2
under secretary of the treasury @entity11 , who developed some of the existing financial sanctions against @entity6 under the @entity17 administration , said at a @entity19 hearing that the " comprehensive " plan would target " key vulnerabilities and fissures " in @entity6 to show @entity21 that it would face " serious costs " for thwarting international demands			1
" it takes into account that no single sanction is a ' silver bullet ' ; we will need to impose measures simultaneously in many different forms in order to be effective , " @entity11 said			0
he stressed , however , that the @entity34 would be mindful of actions that would harm the @entity6 people or undercut the opposition battling the @entity6 government			1
the hearing comes as some members of @entity10 push for tougher @entity34 sanctions on the @entity6 regime in light of the recent revelation that @entity6 was building a second uranium enrichment facility near @entity46 , a dramatic development that jacked up tension between @entity6 and international powers			1
during talks last week in @entity51 , @entity52 , between @entity6 officials and representatives of the so - called @entity55 -- the @entity34 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 -- @entity6 agreed to admit inspectors from the @entity62 to the @entity46 facility			1
@entity21 also agreed " in principle " to ship its low - enriched uranium produced in @entity6 to third countries for further enrichment for a nuclear reactor used for medical research			0
deputy secretary of state @entity70 told the panel tuesday that one reason for the @entity4 administration 's engagement toward @entity6 was to secure international support for sanctions if @entity6 continued to defy international demands			2
last week 's talks , he said , shined a " spotlight " on @entity6 that makes inaction more costly			0
@entity11 also stressed that an international coalition was key to keeping pressure on @entity6			1
" because financial measures are most effective when imposed as part of a broad - based effort with support of the largest possible international coalition , we are working closely with our allies as we put together this strategy , " he said			1
" the less united we are in applying pressure , the greater the risk our measures will not have the impact we seek			0
" several lawmakers expressed doubt that @entity6 would negotiate in good faith and threatened legislation to impose tough new sanctions against @entity21			0
committee chairman @entity100 , @entity101 , said he planned to move forward this month on a proposal to expand financial restrictions , impose new sanctions on @entity6 's oil and gas sectors and ban both the export of refined gasoline products to @entity6 and the import of @entity6 goods			0
@entity70 said the @entity34 and its allies will judge @entity6 's seriousness about the talks by whether it makes good on its commitments to ship the uranium out of the country and admit the @entity62 inspectors , who are expected to visit the @entity46 facility october 25			2
" by the end of the month , we will have some very clear indications of what their intentions are , " he said .			0

" @entity126 " plan would target " key vulnerabilities , " official says
but @entity34 would be mindful of actions that would harm @entity6 people , he says
international coalition is key to keeping pressure up , diplomat says
