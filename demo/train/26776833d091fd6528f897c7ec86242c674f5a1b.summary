-- it 's too late to stop @entity2 from publishing thousands more classified documents , nabbed from the @entity5 's secret network			1
but the @entity7 military is telling its troops to stop using cds , dvds , thumb drives and every other form of removable media -- or risk a court martial			1
maj. gen. @entity15 , commander of @entity16 , issued the december 3 " @entity17 " -- obtained by @entity18 -- which directs airmen to " immediately cease use of removable media on all systems , servers , and stand alone machines residing on @entity25 , " the @entity5 's secret network			1
similar directives have gone out to the military 's other branches			1
" unauthorized data transfers routinely occur on classified networks using removable media and are a method the insider threat uses to exploit classified information			2
to mitigate the activity , all @entity16 organizations must immediately suspend all @entity25 data transfer activities on removable media , " the order adds			0
it 's one of a number of moves the @entity5 is making to prevent further disclosures of secret information in the wake of the @entity2 document dumps			1
@entity49 says he downloaded hundreds of thousands of files from @entity25 to a cd marked " @entity53 " before giving the files to @entity2			0
to stop that from happening again , an august internal review suggested that the @entity5 disable all classified computers ' ability to write to removable media			1
about 60 percent of military machines are now connected to a @entity60 , which looks for anomalous behavior			2
and now there 's this disk - banning order			0
one military source who works on these networks says it will make the job harder ; classified computers are often disconnected from the network , or are in low - bandwidth areas			1
a dvd or a thumb drive is often the easiest way to get information from one machine to the next			2
" they were asking us to build homes before , " the source says			2
" now they 're taking away our hammers			0
" the order acknowledges that the ban will make life trickier for some troops			1
" users will experience difficulty with transferring data for operational needs which could impede timeliness on mission execution , " the document admits			0
but " military personnel who do not comply ... may be punished under @entity95 of the @entity96			2
" @entity95 92 is the armed forces ' regulation covering failure to obey orders and dereliction of duty , and it stipulates that violators " shall be punished as a court - martial may direct			0
" but to several @entity5 insiders , the steps taken so far to prevent another big secret data dump have been surprisingly small			1
" after all the churn ...			0
the general perception is business as usual			0
i 'm not kidding , " one of those insiders says			0
" we have n't turned a brain cell on it			0
" tape and disk backups , as well as hard drive removals , will continue as normal in the military 's @entity117 , where top - secret information is discussed and handled			1
and removable drives have been banned on @entity25 before			2
two years ago , the @entity5 forbade the media 's use after the drives and disks helped spread a relatively unsophisticated worm onto hundreds of thousands of computers			1
the ban was lifted this february , after the worm cleanup effort , dubbed " @entity129 , " was finally completed			0
shortly thereafter , @entity49 says he started passing information to @entity2			0
specialists at the @entity132 are looking for additional technical ways to limit , disable or audit military users ' actions			2
@entity136 , the @entity5 's leading - edge research arm , has launched an effort to " greatly increase the accuracy , rate and speed with which insider threats are detected ... within government and military interest networks			1
" but , like all @entity136 projects , this one wo n't be ready to deploy for years -- if ever			0
for now , the @entity5 is stuck with more conventional methods to @entity2 - proof its networks			1
