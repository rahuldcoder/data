editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			2
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- several events converged recently that conspired to take me back to the summer of 2006 , the summer i snuck into @entity22			1
the first event was the @entity22 elections			1
the second was the @entity26			2
the third was a concert at a little bar tucked into a hip corner of the hippest neighborhood in the world -- @entity33 , @entity7			2
these events all brought me a little closer to that time , a little closer to recalling the way things were back then			2
and i realized how much i had forgotten			2
the summer / fall of 2006 had a name -- at least it did in @entity22			1
it was called the @entity41			0
it was one of the most bloody periods of the war			0
the moment just before the surge where hundreds of people -- hundreds of @entity22 -- were dying every day			1
i say we snuck into the country because we did			1
we had been trying to obtain permission to get into the country legally , but it was proving very difficult			1
we heard through a friend that you could fly into @entity55 through @entity56			0
without any papers we bought one - way tickets in cash from @entity55 to @entity60			0
to me it was a really bad sign : who was in charge of the ( expletive ) show down there ? there was a real feeling of desperation in the air when my friend @entity70 and i landed at the @entity71			0
someone in @entity22 even told us that there was a rumor floating around that the @entity76 forces were seriously considering building a moat around the city			1
once inside , we aligned to our mission : to find and interview the only heavy metal band in the country , @entity82			1
it was n't easy , but we found the guys -- @entity85 and @entity86 -- and spent a week interviewing them in locations that would keep them safe from accusations of collaboration with the enemy			0
we met two of the nicest , warmest , funniest dudes , and through them our perspective on this war , and all war , was fundamentally changed			0
for the first time , i saw the war through the eyes of the oppressed , and saw it for what it was : ( expletive ) stupid			0
it was a stupid , stupid war			0
and the old men that conducted it , on both sides , were essentially the same ugly evil idiots ; the same ideologues that championed their own particular visions of a new world order under the banner of their chosen gods -- money , freedom , oil , @entity118 -- take your pick			0
see the rest of @entity122 in @entity60 at @entity9 the recent elections saw a flare in the random violence that characterized the hottest periods of the war and reminded me that the desire to kill is still very much alive in @entity22			1
that the cost of life is still very low			0
the recent @entity26 proved to me how myopic we still are about that war , about our role in it			0
( @entity137 ) @entity136 's champions film of champions ( " the @entity139 " ) shows the @entity76 as the heroes , addicted to comradeship and the thrill of battle , and the @entity22 as the faceless aggressors resorting to cheap tactics and foul play			1
a rather disgusting narrative point of view , especially unnerving when you consider how determined @entity136 et screaming actors @entity150 were to create an apolitical discursive cocoon around their film			2
it 's as though they were being willfully , culturally stupid , which is strange from a director that is considered , buy most accounts , to be an intelligent filmmaker			0
last night , i made my way to a little event at a little bar in @entity7			0
almost four years since my trip to @entity22 , and those awesome dudes -- @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity165 and @entity166 -- now live in @entity8			1
they made it out of @entity22 , out of exile in @entity170 , out of the limbo of their refugee existences in @entity174 , and they made it to the stage			1
last night @entity82 rocked out			1
they are alive and well , and growing their hair long in peace			1
as they played i could n't help thinking that behind these four guys stands an entire generation of young @entity22 who had their lives torn apart for a truly stupid war that was built on lies and sustained by our inability to empathize			1
the first decade of the century was a shame			0
i just hope we learn something from it .			0
