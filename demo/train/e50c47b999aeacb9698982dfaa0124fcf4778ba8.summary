five years ago , when i traveled to @entity4 to take photographs and film a documentary about @entity3 's work in @entity8			0
today , i continue to be inspired by the mothers , health workers , volunteers and government officials i met during my travels who remain dedicated to stopping this deadly virus from infecting another generation			0
but more than an inspiration , my trip to @entity4 was an education			0
i learned that not only is pediatric @entity20 almost 100 % preventable , but that we have tools available to achieve an @entity24 - free generation within this lifetime			1
by giving an hiv - positive pregnant woman access to antiretroviral therapy ( @entity28 ) during pregnancy and breastfeeding , we can almost ensure that her baby will be born and remain @entity20 - free			1
sadly , many of the women and children who need these crucial services still do n't receive them			0
according to the 2013 @entity38 , 700 children are infected with @entity20 every day			1
most contract the virus from their mothers during pregnancy , childbirth or breastfeeding			0
and only one third of those children currently have access to the medications that will help them remain healthy			0
another @entity38 report from 2012 says without @entity28 , half of all hiv - positive children wo n't live past the age of 2 and 80 % of them will die before their 5th birthday			0
while these numbers are staggering , so is progress that has been made since @entity58 first started her fight to help children with pediatric hiv more than 25 years ago			0
@entity20 has been virtually eliminated in the @entity61 and @entity62 and thanks to programs such as the @entity61 president 's @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , we are closer than ever before to ending pediatric @entity20 in @entity8 and other resource - limited regions around the world			1
we can see evidence of @entity66 's positive impact firsthand in stories like that of @entity75 , a woman i met during my trip to @entity4			0
@entity75 discovered she was @entity20 - positive after becoming pregnant with her daughter , @entity79 , in 2004 -- when @entity20 / @entity24 was killing millions of people each year and resources to treat and prevent the virus in @entity8 were very limited			1
but , thanks to @entity66 , @entity75 received the medicine she needed to prevent transmitting @entity20 to her child			2
today , almost 10 years later , @entity79 is happy , healthy and @entity20 - negative			2
@entity75 was so inspired by @entity66 and @entity3 's work to help hiv - positive mothers and their children that she went back to school to become a nurse and now works at a clinic in @entity93			2
this past june , @entity75 and @entity79 joined @entity61 secretary of state @entity94 in @entity95 to celebrate the fact that since @entity66 began in 2003 , 1 million babies , just like @entity79 , have been born @entity20 - free			1
preventing mother - to - child transmission of @entity20 is the first step toward achieving an aids - free generation			1
i encourage everyone to take a few moments out of your day to learn more about the fight for an aids - free future			1
tweet , post to @entity109 , or even just talk to someone you know about pediatric @entity20 and what each of us can do to make sure that this generation is the last one to face this devastating epidemic .			2

photographer @entity117 is an *ambassador* for the @entity2
@entity2 's mission is to create an aids - free generation
more than 700 children are infected with @entity20 every day , most as a result of mother - to - child transmission
