@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 accused @entity1 of launching ground and aerial attacks inside @entity1 's territory sunday			1
" there have been bombings since 9 this morning , and at 1 o'clock they launched a ground attack , " said @entity6 , @entity1 's minister of information			1
the clashes came after the southern army said it withdrew troops from a contested , oil - rich border region			0
a spokesman for the @entity1 military could not be immediately reached for comment			1
claims from both sides are difficult to confirm , as journalists and independent observers do not have access to the front lines			0
@entity1 announced friday that it would comply with a request from the @entity26 @entity25 to pull troops out of the disputed oil - rich region of @entity30 , which it had occupied since april 10			1
@entity1 claimed its forces had forced southern troops out and captured the area			2
@entity6 said his country 's army withdrew to bases near the border and inside @entity1			1
@entity1 forces crossed the border and attacked them there , he said			2
" they are trying to drag us back into a war , and that 's what the @entity25 did n't want , " he said			1
" they must tell them to stop these attacks			0
" @entity6 said the bases near the border have been repeatedly attacked in the past by @entity1 troops based in @entity30 , and those previous attacks prompted @entity1 to occupy the area			2
@entity30 is on the border created last year when the two countries split			0
@entity1 president @entity58 had vowed to " never give up " the disputed region			0
while both countries claim @entity30 , @entity1 continued administering the region after @entity1 declared independence last july following a two - decade civil war			2
the south took with it three quarters of the formerly united country 's oil reserves , a loss that sent @entity1 's economy reeling			1

the @entity81 released images sunday that suggest a critical part of the oil pipeline infrastructure was destroyed			2
the collection manifold , which allows oil flows to be separated or combined without interrupting the flow , appears to have been damaged by an explosion			0
" the evident destruction of the collection manifold is a big deal in that this by itself is likely to result in immediate cessation of oil flow from the area , " said @entity89 , a spokesman for the project , which is led by the @entity91			0
@entity89 said analysts could not determine whether the destruction was the result of ground fighting or aerial bombardment			0
on friday , @entity1 's military spokesman , @entity104 , told reporters in @entity0 that @entity1 had bombed @entity30 's central processing facility the previous day and that it continued to burn			1
serious damage to the facility would prevent companies from resuming production and would require substantial investment to repair or rebuild			0
