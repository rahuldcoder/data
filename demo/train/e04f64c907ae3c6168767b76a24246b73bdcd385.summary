-- an advocate for the family of @entity3 , executed six years ago after a fire killed three of his daughters , is sharply questioning the objectivity of the head of the @entity9 commission looking into whether the man was rightly convicted			1
@entity11 , the policy director of the nonprofit legal advocacy group the @entity12 , brought up a comment attributed last week to @entity14 , chairman of the @entity15 , during the public comments portion of that panel 's meeting friday			2
according to the published report , @entity14 said that anti-death penalty groups wanted to hold up @entity3 -- convicted in 1992 after a jury determined he deliberately set the fire that killed his three girls -- as a " poster boy " for their cause			1
@entity14 questioned that approach , calling @entity3 " a guilty monster			0
" " this is a very clear statement , ' @entity3 is a guilty monster , ' that brings into question the reliability of your chairman , " said @entity11			2
@entity14 downplayed the criticism as " @entity37 lawyers " making " personal attacks , rather than legal arguments			1
" founded by @entity40 and @entity41 , the @entity12 is a @entity37 - based nonprofit that pursues legal challenges and push policy reforms aimed at exonerating people wrongfully convicted of crimes and preventing future injustices			2
death - penalty opponents have said an impartial review of @entity3 's case could lead to the unprecedented admission that the state executed an innocent man			1
@entity3 's daughters -- 2 - year - old @entity54 and 1 - year - old twins @entity56 and @entity57 -- died when their @entity59 , @entity9 , home went up in flames in 1991			1
the state 's fire marshal , @entity61 , told jurors in @entity3 's trial that the fire was set intentionally and spread quickly due to an inflammable liquid			1
while a jury convicted @entity3 of murder , three reviews of evidence by outside experts found the arson determination was based on outdated or faulty science			1
the first of those reports was sent to gov. @entity77 's office and submitted to appeals courts before @entity3 's execution , while the other two came after his death			2
the last of those was ordered in 2008 by the @entity15 , itself authorized in 2005 by an act of the @entity9 state legislature			0
in that report , @entity86 - based fire science expert @entity85 concluded that the arson finding " could not be sustained " -- based on current - day investigative standards , as well as those in place in 1991			0
but two days before the panel was set to hear from @entity85 , gov. @entity77 shook up the commission with three appointments , including one to replace the panel 's chairman			1
@entity77 later called the move " pretty normal protocol , " since the departing members ' terms had expired			0
as governor , he had signed off on @entity3 's execution , and critics have accused him of trying to derail a review of that case			2
@entity77 has said he 's confident @entity3 was guilty , while police in @entity59 say other evidence beyond the arson testimony supports the prosecution			0
the @entity15 's movement on the investigation has slowed as the board 's new chairman , @entity14 , urged a review of the panel 's operating rules			1
@entity14 , who was appointed to his current job as @entity118 district attorney in 2001 ahead of his election one year later , said this summer that the @entity3 probe " absolutely " will continue , though he would not say when			0
in july , the @entity15 found that arson investigators used flawed science in their probe of the @entity3 matter , but were not negligent and did not commit misconduct			0
at friday 's hearing , @entity11 noted " concerns " about several moves that @entity14 had made and questioned whether it was necessary to " revisit everything " that the commission had done prior to @entity14 's appointment			0
" it 's pretty clear that the commission was going along pretty swimmingly until gov. @entity77 ... appointed @entity14 as the new commissioner , " added @entity133 in a phone interview with @entity0			0
" since he has been part of the new commission , he 's tried to stop the commission from doing what we believe that it should be doing			0
" later in the hearing , several of the @entity147 's members engaged in a heated exchange over the @entity3 case and the panel 's role			1
dr. @entity153 , for instance , said " it is important to maintain credibility " given the intense media spotlight on the case , while fellow members @entity158 and dr. @entity160 also questioned the validity of @entity3 's conviction			1
but @entity14 said that much of the debate over @entity3 's case was being fanned by the media and other outside influences			0
he also noted that authorities , ranging from parole boards to the @entity169 @entity168 , had looked into the trial and conviction ahead of @entity3 's execution			0
" we 're being used , and we should recognize that , " @entity14 said			0
on thursday in @entity9 , district court judge @entity176 rebuffed a request by @entity179 district attorney @entity178 that he step aside as he opened a hearing into whether @entity3 's name should be cleared six years after his execution			1
members of @entity3 's family pushed for the hearing , claiming that " junk science " led to a wrongful conviction and execution .			2
