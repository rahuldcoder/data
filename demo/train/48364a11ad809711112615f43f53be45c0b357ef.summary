were " wave " elections in which one party won a sweeping victory			1
they elect a president of one party , then two years later almost inevitably give the other party a huge victory in the midterm election			0
why do they expect things to change ? good question			2
it 's always dangerous to speak of a country of 319 million as having a singular will , or of an election expressing that will			2
that 's particularly true when only about 40 % of eligible voters show up for midterm elections			1
like every party that wins , the @entity29 will claim that " the @entity3 people " have endorsed its agenda in full , and therefore if president @entity32 stands in its way , then he 's thwarting the public 's desires			1
we 've established that the public is fed up with a @entity39 seemingly incapable of getting anything done			0
the trouble is that the voters -- unanimous in their abhorrence of gridlock -- just delivered a result almost guaranteed to produce more gridlock			2
to be fair , there was one party assuring them that their votes would do just the opposite			0
@entity29 candidates promised voters that they 'd stand in @entity32 's way , and also promised that they 'd " get things done , " sometimes in the same sentence			1
as the @entity62 's @entity61 reported last week , " these two seemingly contradictory messages are at the heart of @entity29 @entity59 campaigns across the country			1
i 've heard them from candidate after candidate			0
" it 's one thing to vote @entity29 because it 's the party that reflects your beliefs			1
but if you 're voting @entity29 because you want to see @entity39 become more conciliatory and productive , you really should have been paying closer attention the last six years			2
that 's because obstructionism has n't been an accident , or a reaction to moves on @entity32 's part that @entity29 found objectionable			1
it was a strategy they employed from the outset			0
literally on the day @entity32 was inaugurated , @entity29 leaders gathered over dinner and made a decision to oppose everything he proposed , to deny him both substantive progress and whatever political benefits might accrue to a president who looks like he 's accomplishing things			1
in 2010 , @entity90 explained to the @entity91 how important it was to present a unified front of opposition to the president 's proposals , because then the public would dismiss the debate as just partisan bickering			0
" mr. @entity90 spent hours listening to the worries and ideas of @entity29 , " the paper reported , " urging them not to be seduced by the attention - grabbing possibilities of cutting a bipartisan deal			2
" as political strategy , it was extremely astute and executed to near perfection			0
@entity108 understood well that the president gets credit when @entity111 works and blame when it does n't -- whether he deserves it in either case			0
so @entity29 could pour sand in the gears of government and watch @entity32 suffer for it			1
what was the result of six years of unprecedented filibusters , debt ceiling crises , a government shutdown , 50 futile @entity126 repeal votes , endless conspiracy theorizing and a dramatic increase in general buffoonery ? republicans took back the @entity131 in 2010 , and have now taken the @entity59			0
voters rewarded their misdeeds by returning them to power			0
and now politicians in both parties are saying they want to come together to accomplish things for the public			0
the problem is that they do n't agree on the things they 'd like to accomplish			1
the argument is n't over means ; it 's over ends			2
that 'll be even truer when the new @entity39 is inaugurated in january than it is now			0
the new class of freshman republicans in both the @entity131 and @entity59 is even more conservative than the existing @entity29 caucus ( if you thought such a thing was possible ) , and to them , " getting things done " means slashing environmental protections , taking away health coverage from the millions who have obtained it through the @entity126 and cutting taxes on the wealthy			1
if those new representatives actually managed to turn those beliefs into law , the public would say , " hey , we did n't vote for that ! " and they did n't , even in this @entity29 - leaning year			1
voters in four deep - red states -- @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167 -- used ballot initiatives to approve one of the @entity171 's highest economic priorities , increasing the minimum wage			2
" @entity175 " initiatives that would ban abortion failed , not only in the swing state of @entity177 but in conservative @entity178 as well			0
in other words , where voters had the chance to decide policy issues , they chose the @entity171 position even as they were voting for @entity29 candidates			1
so what do the @entity3 people want ? they want to have their cake and eat it , too			1
as political scientists have known for decades , @entity3 are " symbolic conservatives " but " operational liberals " -- they like things like small government in the abstract , but they also like all the things government does			2
they elect @entity171 who try to accomplish complex policy goals , then turn around and elect @entity29 when things do n't work perfectly			1
they say they hate gridlock , then elect people who will give them more of it			0
and two years from now , a whole new crop of candidates will barnstorm the country , saying , " elect me , and we 'll clean up this mess			0
" and the voters ( or at least enough of them ) will , despite all evidence and experience , actually buy it .			0

@entity214 : in recent " wave " elections , @entity3 voters ca n't seem to make up their minds
he says they abhor gridlock but have elected @entity29 *lawmakers* committed to that very thing
he says @entity29 winners said they 'd " get things done " and stand in @entity32 's way
@entity3 want to have their cake and eat it , too , @entity214 says
