@entity0 , @entity1 -- a rodeo cowboy with a bum shoulder , a middle - aged woman who has trouble sleeping and a handful of snowboarders are all crowded around a shiny aluminum trailer on a sunny winter day			2
some clutch x-rays , others look around nervously hoping a neighbor wo n't spot them as they wait in line for a medical marijuana prescription			1
if this all seems a little weird , you probably do n't live in @entity1 , where medical marijuana is the new normal			1
state - sanctioned marijuana dispensaries now outnumber @entity20 in @entity1			1
but outside @entity22 and @entity23 , few doctors are comfortable dealing with medical marijuana			1
now , residents in rural @entity1 towns like @entity0 can see a doctor who are willing to prescribe medical marijuana aboard two shiny aluminum vintage airstream trailers , which have been converted into mobile doctors ' offices			1
the trailers criss - cross the state , providing exams for new patients and access to medical marijuana for those deemed eligible			1
it 's all part of the @entity38 , the brainchild of @entity37 , a 37 - year - old entrepreneur			2
" the doctors are the gatekeepers to make sure the patients have access to the medicine , " he said			2
" we want to be sure no patient is left behind and it starts with the rural communities			2
" a doctor must first examine would - be patients and , if the physician signs off , the state of @entity1 will issue a card allowing these patients to buy marijuana from dispensaries around the state			1
an exam costs $ 100 , but @entity37 said he operates on a sliding scale for patients who ca n't afford to pay the full price			0
" right now our doctors will see 10 % of our patients for free and we can provide a 30 to 50 % discount to disabled veterans as well as other folks in need in programs like @entity67 and @entity68 , " said @entity37			2
@entity69 , a 52 - year - old tree - cutter , is one of those waiting in line to see if he qualifies for a prescription			0
he says the ibuprofen he 's been using to treat his chronic pain just is n't enough			0
" i just hope to deaden the pain and help my quality of life , " he said			0
the mobile clinic has saved him a 300 - mile round trip drive to @entity22 , the nearest place where he could find a doctor willing to write a recommendation for medical marijuana			1
ten years ago , @entity1 voters passed a constitutional amendment allowing for the medical use of marijuana , but it remains against federal law			1
two years ago , the @entity91 administration signaled that it would no longer go after medical marijuana in states that have legalized it			1
so , like a modern day gold rush , hundreds of marijuana dispensaries have sprung up in storefronts across the state			1
once - vacant warehouses now house elaborate growing operations			0
medical marijuana is @entity1 's ' green rush ' millions of dollars in taxes have been collected and more than 115,000 people have received medical marijuana cards			1
as the industry grows , @entity37 -- a former real estate property manager -- said he " felt like the patient was being lost in all this			2
" that sentiment was echoed by dr. @entity109 , one of the doctors with the @entity38 who is seeing patients in @entity0			2
she now works exclusively with medical marijuana patients			1
after just a year of writing medical marijuana recommendations , she already has 1,500 patients			1
" in the last couple of years or so i became aware of what was happening with medical marijuana in @entity1 and i looked at marijuana as a medication and was very surprised at how beneficial it was , " she said			1
but moving into this new industry has been risky for established doctors			0
they face the potential of being shunned in the medical community and many fear running afoul of federal law			0
" it 's been very difficult talking about it , " @entity109 said			0
" i do n't think my parents even know , so there is a stigma			0
but i did make a decision that it was important to talk about this so patients have access			0
" she believes the situation is changing quickly , and soon she thinks medical marijuana will be widely accepted across the country			1
" in @entity1 it 's much [ more ] accepted and people are learning the benefits			2
so many people either have a family member or a friend or have heard about it or themselves have a card so there 's more understanding here			0
" @entity109 says marijuana is particularly effective at dealing with chronic pain for patients like @entity69			0
after asking him a series of questions about his pain and examining his mri , she approves him			0
he is eager to try some marijuana , and may even try to grown his own			0
the tree cutter says hopes the drug will " help me get through my labor everyday with a little less pain and maybe sleep a little better at night			0
" " ca n't hurt , " he says , as he climbs back into his battered pickup truck and drives off .			0

there are more medical marijuana dispensaries in @entity1 than @entity20
rural residents still have *limited* access to doctors who can prescribe medical marijuana
now , mobile clinics cross the state , *brining* doctors who can provide access to the drug
" we want to be sure no patient is left behind , " says mobile clinic entrepreneur
