-- on october 12 , 2000 , a suicide bomber attacked the @entity2 as it refueled in @entity4 , @entity5			1
a rubber boat packed with explosives detonated , killing 17 and wounding at least 37 more			2
ten years later the destroyer -- also known as @entity2 -- is in port at @entity10 , @entity11 , after returning just a month ago from a mission in the @entity13 , according to @entity15 lt. @entity14			1
the ship 's crew and others commemorated the 10 - year anniversary tuesday at @entity10			1
" we lost 17 of our shipmates that terrible morning 10 years ago , but they were far more than just our sailors , " said adm. @entity20 , commander of @entity21			2
" they were your fathers , your sons and daughters , your sisters and brothers			0
they loved to work on cars			0
they ran track and played football			0
they acted in high school plays			0
they loved life , they loved living and they loved you			0
" they were proud to serve , " he said			0
" ... we remember them here in this special place , where we can keep them close			0
" @entity20 and current @entity2 crew members laid a wreath before a memorial honoring those who died , after their names , rank and hometowns were read			1
guests were asked to rise and " taps " was played			0
@entity20 also spoke of the heroism of the @entity2 crew who worked for three days to save the ship and tend their injured crewmates following the explosion			1
they acted with no electrical power and no shipboard communication system to coordinate efforts , he said			2
" the first 48 hours provided no opportunity for rest , and when they did find a moment to lay down , it was on a hot steel deck under a blazing sun , " he said			0
" ... they were on their own , and what help there was , was far away			0
" " ask any of our @entity2 sailors today about their actions during the fight to save the ship and i believe they 'll all tell you the same thing -- ' we were @entity89 sailors , and we did what we had to do			1
we just did our jobs			0
' " no greater testament exists to the courage and tenacity of the @entity2 crew of october 2000 than the @entity2 today , " he said			1
" we brought @entity2 back , healed her wounds and made her ready to serve once again , just as we did with so many of the @entity2 sailors who were also so grievously wounded that day			1
" the @entity89 has made changes in the decade since the incident , he said			1
recruits must now undergo a drill on the same type of boat as the @entity2 , where they must put out fires , battle flooding and tend to wounded people -- very like what the @entity2 crew did following the blast			1
the bomb blast 10 years ago ripped a 40 - by - 60 - foot hole in the side of the ship , according to the @entity89			1
over 14 months , shipyard workers in @entity120 , @entity121 , replaced 550 tons of steel plate and 275 miles of cable			0
after $ 250 million of repairs and updates , the @entity2 returned to duty in april 2002			1
glass cases on board the @entity2 display three @entity130 flags to commemorate the terrorist attack , according to the @entity89			1
the first is the flag that was flying when the attack occurred			0
another draped the coffin of a fallen crew member			2
the third was flown upon the ship 's first return to the @entity13 after the attack			2
a plaque commemorates the victims , and the deck is inlaid with 17 stars to serve as reminders of those who died			1
" i used to play a little game with myself : say all their names every time i stepped on a star , " said @entity147 , one of 40 sailors who were on board during the attack and served with the renovated vessel 's crew of 350			2
" i think it sends a message of what kind of country we have and what we 're willing to do to keep our ships back at sea , " @entity147 told @entity0 in 2002 when the ship redeployed			2
in december 2000 , an investigation found that the @entity2 had not fully implemented its security plan the day of the attack			1
" they did n't do everything they said they were going to do , " a @entity170 official familiar with the investigation told @entity0 then			0
the @entity2 was operating under an alert level that warns of " an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist activity " but with no particular target			1
that threat condition calls for a standard list of anti-terrorism measures , including one that requires that " unauthorized craft should be kept away from the ship			1
" the blast occurred when a small boat that appeared to be friendly pulled up alongside the @entity2 and exploded			2
in an online video , " @entity2 10 years later , " the @entity89 touts improved security measures resulting from the @entity2 attack			1
" the attack of the @entity2 prompted a shift in damage control training throughout the @entity89 , " the narration reads			1
and when recruits train in " mass casualty , " clocks are set at 11:18 , time the @entity2 was attacked			2
meanwhile , the @entity2 's legacy can still be felt on board today , said @entity14 , who had just joined the @entity89 at the time of the attack but was not yet stationed on the @entity2			1
" we 're just more situation - aware on the anti-terrorism portion of it , " he said			0
@entity14 recalled his feelings when the @entity89 assigned him to the @entity207 : " it was a surreal feeling knowing what it had gone through			2
" in his latest deployment aboard the ship , @entity14 helped rout out pirates in the @entity13 , which bears the name of the port in the attack			0
" initially it was kind of unusual , " @entity14 said			0
" but once we got down to business , it ( the attack ) was not on the forefront			0
" terrorism emanating from @entity5 remains a major threat to the @entity130 , according to a recent assessment by the @entity225			0
" @entity130 analysts now consider @entity230 's affiliate organization in @entity5 a more pressing threat to @entity130 national security than the central leadership as the @entity5 - based outfit is increasingly agile and looking for opportunities to strike abroad , " the report said .			0
