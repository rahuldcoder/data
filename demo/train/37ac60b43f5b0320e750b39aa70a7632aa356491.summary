it happens every summer : a certain song lyric , a momentous movie scene or a fresh - looking fashion colors every memory of the season , even years and decades later			1
this summer , @entity6 takes a look back at summers past to explore the stuff of summer that still speaks to us			1
we 'll start 50 years ago , in 1964 , when temperatures hit 95 degrees in @entity12 , 104 in @entity13 , @entity14 , and 106 in @entity15			1
the @entity16 passed and was signed into law			0
the @entity18 concluded for the first time that warnings should be printed on cigarette packages			0
@entity22 was sentenced to life in prison			0
race riots exploded in @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 , while the " @entity30 " swept through the @entity29			0
the @entity32 in @entity31 were n't quite the talk of the dinner table ; the " summer " games did n't begin until october that year			2
the sights and sounds of that summer were unforgettable to those who were around -- and had an impact on summers future , too			1
here 's a look back at summer of 50 years ago , and the little memories that made it			1
songs of summer : @entity45 goes big every summer seems to have a breakout hit , but they do n't always age so well			1
think about it : fifteen years ago , summer radio was dominated by @entity51 's " @entity50 " -- chorus : " i like girls that wear @entity56 " -- and " @entity57 , " a ( @entity58 - winning ! really ! ) single by @entity59			1
consider the better times : in the summer of 1964 , the @entity61 were touring in the @entity62			1
the @entity63 played their first @entity62 gig			0
the songs topping the charts became classics of the era , by musicians who are still household names : the @entity72 ' " i get around , " the @entity74 ' " @entity73 , " the @entity61 ' " @entity75 , " @entity77 's " people " and the @entity78 " @entity79			1
" big screen blockbusters : sing - alongs on screen @entity62 was still more than a decade away from a true summer blockbuster -- " @entity88 " set that standard in 1975 -- but there were hits on the big screen 50 years ago			2
summer 1964 was a season of musicals , with @entity93 's " @entity97 " opening that may , and " @entity98 , " " @entity99 " and " @entity75 " passing through theaters throughout the rest of the season			1
there was a bit of summer drama too , notably , " @entity103			2
" the film , based on a @entity106 play , starred @entity107 , @entity108 and @entity109			2
the film might as well have starred @entity111 , @entity107 's future wife , given the attention she drew by joining her beau on set			2
@entity115 reads : spy vs. spy in the summer of 1964 , @entity62 did plenty of not - exactly - beachy summer reading			1
@entity120 's memoir of his life in 1920s @entity122 , " a @entity123 , " was among the bestsellers			0
so was @entity126 's " @entity125 , " an analysis of racial oppression in the @entity62			0
but filling far more spaces on bestseller lists were spy stories , and lots of ' em. @entity135 's @entity134 tale , " @entity143 , " @entity137 ' " @entity138 " and @entity139 's " @entity140 " were all among the top books of the season			0
spy stories were n't beholden to the page , either : bond tales " @entity146 " and " @entity147 " were among the top films for the year , too			0
summer style : short dresses and swimwear maybe the realities of 1960s fashion ca n't live up to our imaginations -- thanks , " @entity157 " -- but the buzzed - about looks of summer 1964 were , um , eye - catching			1
that was the summer that bore the discotheque dress -- a short , sleeveless number that gave a gal plenty of room to move			2
within a few years , it would be a staple of the swingin ' ' 60s closet			0
the season also saw the introduction of the @entity172 sandal			0
they would n't arrive stateside for a few more years , but those clunky , cork - soles shoes have now comforted generations of feet ... and haunted picky fashionistas let us not forget 1964 's most jarring fashion : the monokini			2
not familiar ? it was a topless , one - piece women 's bathing suit designed by @entity182			0
shock of shocks : @entity186 breasts at the beach generated a bit of controversy			2
the suit took off among the avant - garde , if not the broader beach - going public			2
stuff of summer : skating and @entity195 in summer 1964 , skateboards were just beginning a slow roll from @entity198 to the rest of the country			1
onetime lifeguard @entity201 had perfected a small surfboard - on - wheels that made skating a lot more daring , and naturally , popular			0
for those not willing to hop on a board , there was the @entity208 , a banana - seated , high - handle barred beast of a bike that had been introduced the year before , and appeared in the @entity208 catalog for the first time in 1964			1
for $ 49.95 , folks could take one home in flamboyant lime , red , radiant coppertone , sky blue or violet			0
a version " for mother , daughter or even grandmother " called the @entity224 sold in radiant blue , violet , or white with rose			0
for a little more flash and a few more bucks , people could pick up a version with chrome fenders and whitewall tires			0
however you rolled , there was a new tool to make the memories of summer 1964 a bit clearer			1
the @entity239 was introduced in 1963 , and millions of the ultra-easy cameras were in circulation within a few years			0
what better way could there be to remember ? @entity244 : my love - in with @entity62 was it really a simpler time ? your ' 60s family photos what are your favorite summer memories , from music to fashion ? share in the comments on , @entity255 @ @entity256 or on @entity6 's @entity258 page !			1

decades later , summer memories are wrapped up in the songs , movies and beach reads
fifty summers ago , the @entity61 , @entity72 and @entity74 dominated the charts
" @entity98 " and " @entity99 " were summer film favorites in 1964
the stuff of summer in 1964 : the @entity208 and @entity271
