@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 told his lawyers that he whispered " punks , " not a racial slur , in the moments before he shot @entity8 , his attorneys told @entity2 on thursday			1
some people interpreted the police recording of @entity4 's call to 911 as evidence the fatal shooting was racially motivated			1
@entity4 attorneys @entity16 and @entity17 told @entity2 their client told them that he said , " f --- ing punks			1
" forensic audio expert @entity21 , who analyzed 911 recordings , agreed the garbled word that raised controversy was " punks , " not the racial slur some people said they heard when @entity21 , chairman emeritus of the @entity27 , used a computer application to remove cell phone interference , the word became clearer , he said			1
after discussions with linguists , he said he became convinced that @entity4 said " punks			2
" he provided @entity2 with a copy of the newly processed audio			1
@entity2 also enhanced the sound of the 911 call , and several members of @entity2 's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether @entity4 used a slur			1
@entity8 's family and supporters say @entity4 , who is @entity44 , profiled @entity8 , who was black , as " suspicious " and ignored a police dispatcher 's request not to follow him			0
@entity8 did not live in @entity0 , @entity1 , but he was there with his father , whose fiancee lives in @entity4 's neighborhood			0
@entity4 , 28 , fatally shot @entity8 , 17 , on february 26			0
the case has triggered a nationwide debate about @entity1 's " @entity55 " law , race and racial profiling			0
while @entity4 's attorneys may welcome @entity21 's analysis of their client 's 911 call , they disagree with his conclusions about what is heard on another 911 recording			1
@entity4 has said he was yelling for help , according to his family members and his account to authorities , as first reported by the @entity68 and later confirmed by @entity0 police			2
but @entity8 's relatives , including his cousin @entity73 , have said they are certain the voice heard on the 911 call is @entity8 's			2
@entity21 and another audio expert , @entity75 , analyzed the recording for the @entity68 using different techniques , and they said they do n't believe it is @entity4 who is heard yelling in the background of one 911 call			1
they compared the screams with @entity4 's voice , as recorded in a 911 call he made minutes earlier describing a " suspicious " black male			1
" there 's a huge chance that this is not @entity4 's voice , " said @entity75 , a longtime audio engineer who is listed as an expert in recorded evidence by the @entity90			2
" after 28 years of doing this , i would put my reputation on the line and say this is not @entity4 screaming			0
" @entity21 also said he does not believe the screams came from @entity4			2
he does not have a sample of @entity8 's voice for comparison , he said			0
he cited software that is widely used in @entity102 and has become recently accepted in the @entity103 that examines characteristics such as pitch and the space between spoken words to analyze voices			0
using it , he found a 48 % likelihood the voice is @entity4 's			0
at least 60 % is necessary to feel confident that two samples are from the same source , he told @entity2 on monday -- meaning it 's unlikely it was @entity4 who can be heard yelling			1
the experts , both of whom said they have testified in cases involving audio analysis , stressed that they can not say who was screaming			0
@entity2 's @entity122 and @entity123 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 said , " f --- ing punks " in 911 call , his attorneys say
forensic audio expert @entity21 agrees the word was " punks , " not a racial slur
@entity21 provided @entity2 with a copy of the processed audio revealing " punks " comment
@entity21 also *disputes* that it was @entity4 yelling on another 911 recording
