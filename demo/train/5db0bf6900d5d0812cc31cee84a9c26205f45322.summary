-- @entity1 will have to wait another day -- at least -- to learn his fate			1
he is charged with first - degree murder in the november 2012 death of 17 - year - old @entity5 , one of four black teenagers who were in an suv shot by @entity1 -- who is white -- in violence that flared from an argument over loud music			1
the @entity14 , @entity15 , jury in @entity1 's case deliberated all day friday , only to send a message to the judge shortly before 7 p.m. that they had " reached a wall for the evening			1
" in other words , for the second straight day they had n't reached a decision			0
with that , judge @entity23 gave them the ok to head back to their hotel so that they could return for deliberations around 9 a.m. saturday			1
" this is one admirable group , " @entity23 told the court shortly before dismissing the jury			2
" they are clearly taking this thing as seriously as they should			0
and i could n't be more proud of them for how hard they are working			0
" this announcement capped a relatively uneventful day friday , after what had been an emotional and eventful trial			0
the closest thing to news came shortly before 5 p.m. , when @entity42 answered a question from the jury : is it possible to not reach a verdict on one count and reach a verdict on other counts ? to which @entity23 responded : yes			2
prosecutors contend that @entity1 's firing into the suv equates to an act of murder			1
in addition to that count , @entity1 also has been charged with three counts of attempted murder			1
if found guilty , he faces up to life in prison			1
a " comprehensive public safety plan " has been established ahead of a verdict in the case , according to the @entity65 joint information center handling the @entity1 trial			1
" all contingencies have been planned for , " the @entity65 statement said			0
" we will not discuss the specifics of any security plan			0
we will continue to protect the rights of those who choose to peaceably demonstrate			0
" trial draws comparisons to another @entity15 case the @entity1 case has drawn parallels to the trial of @entity81 in the killing of teenager @entity83 , which like the current trial had racial overtones and claims of self - defense			1
@entity1 defense attorney @entity89 told @entity0 's @entity90 on friday that the @entity81 and @entity1 cases are n't so similar in his mind			1
there was a physical confrontation between @entity81 and @entity83 , and police gave @entity81 the benefit of the doubt about defending himself , @entity89 said			0
" my client did not wait to become that victim ; my client did not wait to either get assaulted by a weapon or have someone potentially pull a trigger , " he said			0
unlike the @entity81 case , police rushed to charge @entity1 with murder , the defense attorney said			1
" they already made up their mind before they even had the evidence basically looked at and put together , " he said			0
even though a weapon was never found , @entity89 maintains the youths could have had one			0
@entity1 felt threatened and acted to defend himself , he said			1
" now , does it sound irrational ? of course it sounds irrational			0
but have you ever been in that situation ? " @entity89 said			0
jurors on thursday asked to see surveillance video from the gas station where @entity1 shot @entity5			1
the video contains 20 minutes of footage from multiple angles , though a shorter version showing only one angle was slated to be shown in court			0
in closing arguments wednesday , prosecutors said inconsistencies between @entity1 's words and actions undermined his assertion he acted in self - defense when he fatally shot the teen			1
his attorney countered the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his client was guilty			0
he pleaded with jurors to find @entity1 not guilty			1
in testimony tuesday , @entity1 said he fired in self - defense after the teen threatened him with a gun			1
" my intent was to stop the attack , not necessarily end a life , " he said			2
" it just worked out that way			0
" defendant says he was ' crazy with grief ' ' there was no gun ' but assistant state attorney @entity155 said wednesday that @entity1 's claims do n't add up			1
she noted that @entity1 fired 10 shots at the suv , three of them while the car was fleeing			1
he never took cover -- but instead opened his car door -- even though he would later tell detectives he had seen a weapon , she said			2
" there was no gun , " @entity155 told jurors			0
in addition , she said , he did not tell his fiancee , @entity5 , that he had seen a weapon until more than a month later			2
@entity1 also left the scene of the shooting , went back to a hotel where they were staying and walked his dog , she said			2
and he returned the next day to his house -- more than two hours away -- all without calling 911 , @entity155 said			0
opinion : did @entity15 shooter make his case on the stand ? ' @entity180 ' @entity1 has testified he described the music to his fiancee as " rap crap			2
" in the parking lot , as the music blared , " his blood started to boil ; he did n't like the music that was coming out of the car next to him ; he got angrier and angrier , " @entity155 said			0
@entity1 rolled down his window and asked the youths to turn it down , which they did , but then turned it back up , @entity155 said			2
" he got angry at the fact that a 17 - year - old kid decided not to listen to him , " she said , adding that @entity1 then pulled a 9 mm gun out of his glove box and shot " systematically and methodically " at the suv			1
" nobody denied that @entity5 was talking back			2
but this defendant took it upon himself to silence @entity5 forever			2
" @entity1 testified tuesday that he saw @entity5 reach down and pick something up , and that he saw about " 4 inches of a barrel " from a 12 - or 20 - gauge shotgun above the window			1
opinion : @entity15 shooter saw black , thought ' threat ' ' you 're not going to kill me ' he muttered aloud to himself , " ' you 're not going to kill me , you son of a bitch , ' " as he opened the glove compartment , grabbed his pistol , dropped the holster at his feet , chambered a round and began firing , he said			2
nine of the 10 rounds hit the car , and three of them struck @entity5 , one of them cutting through his liver , his lung and his aorta			2
@entity155 rejected @entity1 's assertion he had been trying to de-escalate the situation and he feared for his life			1
@entity89 , the defense attorney , noted that no witnesses had accused @entity1 of using any hate words and testified that his client had just come from a wedding , where his ex-wife said he had appeared to be in a good mood			1
@entity89 noted that the @entity196 departed the gas station after the shooting and was gone for three minutes before it returned , enough time for the youths to have dumped a gun			0
detectives did not search the area for days after the shooting , he said			0
the court has decided not to release the identifications of the jurors , fearing they could be the subject of threats , but a court document shows the jury is made up of four white females , two black females , four white males , an @entity258 female and a @entity260 male , plus four alternates			0
@entity0 's @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
