three people washed off their crippled ship and engulfed by @entity3 waters roiled by @entity4 scrambled for help on monday , the @entity6 said , but only one of them made it to safety			1
when the @entity11 's crew members realized their lives were in danger off the @entity15 coast in the dark morning hours , they made a short journey they hoped they 'd never have to take -- to two waiting life rafts			1
but only 13 of the 16 people aboard got off the ship safely , initially , and only one of the three washed overboard made it into a raft , coast guard vice adm. @entity19 told @entity25			0
that left rescuers scrambling to find them in the frenzied ocean , @entity19 said			0
one of them -- the @entity11 's longtime captain , @entity31 -- remained missing as night approached monday , said lt. @entity32 , a @entity32 spokesman			1
the body of the second , deckhand @entity35 , was found monday evening , the @entity6 announced			1
@entity36 partially collapses , dangles over @entity38 street the 180 - foot , three - masted ship , a replica of the famous @entity42 vessel , foundered about 90 miles off @entity15 as @entity4 's fury churned the @entity3 into 18 - foot seas , its owner , @entity45 , told @entity25 affilliate @entity47			1
@entity45 said @entity31 was attempting to head east , away from the hurricane , when the ship began taking on water			0
" at that time it was n't considered an emergency , even though they had several feet of water inside the boat , " @entity45 said			0
" she 's a very large ship , and that little bit of water really does not do anything to her			2
but somehow we lost power in our generator and in our main engines , and as a result , we could not pump any water out of the boat			0
" as the waves continued to batter the ship , " it just got to the point where she could n't stay afloat anymore			0
" @entity25 meteorologists say the water temperature varies greatly in that part of the ocean because of the gulf stream			0
so the water could be anywhere from 50 to 64 degrees @entity80			0
all of the crew members were wearing orange survival suits with strobe lights designed to keep them afloat , warm and easy to find			1
" but in these conditions , it 's very problematic , " @entity19 said , adding that a timely deployment of search - and - rescue aircraft and ships gives the missing a chance			2
a c - 130 aircraft and a helicopter have been monitoring the area around the shipwreck			0
two @entity6 cutters were en route to the scene to help with search - and - rescue , with one expected to arrive later on monday and the other expected on tuesday , @entity19 said			1
@entity6 helicopters plucked 14 people out of two lifeboats around 6:30 a.m. , petty officer @entity99 said			1
" the first guy we pulled up , he was really happy to see us			0
that 's for sure , " said @entity105 2 @entity6 , a @entity6 rescue swimmer			1
" we got him up there , and he was all excited and saying , ' that 's a good job , ' and everything was great			2
he was just a little cold , but he was good to go			2
" the life boats were designed to hold 25 people and had canopies for shelter against pelting rain and winds			0
all of those rescued arrived at the @entity6 air station in @entity118 , @entity15 , and were in good health , @entity19 said			1
initial reports said 17 crew members were aboard , but the @entity6 later corrected that number			1
the @entity6 said it has " diminished search - and - rescue capabilities " as category 1 @entity4 batters the @entity126 @entity125			2
more sea rescues prompted by @entity4 were reported in @entity128			0
the ship was built for the 1962 film version of " @entity131 , " starring @entity132 , and appeared in the 2006 blockbuster " @entity133 : @entity135			0
" it was once owned by @entity138 winner and @entity25 founder @entity137 , who acquired it in 1986 along with the rights to the @entity143 film library			2
" among the many troubling reports on the devastating impact of @entity4 , i am deeply saddened to hear that the @entity11 was overtaken by the storm , " @entity137 said in a statement monday night			1
" as a sailor and former owner of the @entity11 , my heart goes out to the families of the missing crew members , and i am truly hopeful for their safe recovery			1
" the ship departed @entity155 , @entity156 , for @entity157 , @entity158 , on october 25 , according to the ship 's facebook page			1
@entity162 postings bearing that date say things such as " i 'm sure that @entity4 will be a major consideration when @entity11 leaves for @entity157 later today , " and " @entity11 will be sailing @entity125 out to sea before heading @entity167 to avoid the brunt of @entity4			1
" the ship was scheduled to arrive at the @entity170 in @entity157 as early as november 7 for a public display on november 10 and 11 , the @entity170 's general manager , @entity169 , said monday			1
the @entity157 / @entity173 is promoting " the @entity175 " on its website			2
@entity176 said it 's hard to believe the @entity11 , which has docked in @entity157 for long stretches since the 1970s , is buried under the ocean			1
streets turn to rivers , residents trapped in homes " it had such a history , not only because of ' @entity131 , ' but it 's been a great part of @entity157 for so many years			1
it 's going to be missed , " @entity176 said			2
" it had a majestic look with its tall masts			0
it had an aura about it			0
" while following the ship 's @entity162 timeline , you can read a mixture of trepidation and attempts at soothing fears			2
on saturday , this post appeared : " @entity11 's current voyage is a calculated decision ... not at all ... irresponsible or with a lack of foresight as some have suggested			1
the fact of the matter is ... a ship is @entity211 ! " no one responded to the contact e-mail or phone number listed on the ship 's website and @entity162 account			2
@entity4 is evoking memories of the " nor'easter " that struck off @entity220 in 1991 and inspired the best - selling book and movie " @entity223			0
" @entity224 , who survived that storm on his sailboat before the @entity6 rescued him , said being besieged by high winds and waves can be exhausting , but sometimes sailors just have to deal with that physical discomfort			1
" you do n't really have time to think about much outside , because there 's always about six jobs that need doing , " @entity224 said monday			0
@entity224 said he never felt terribly vulnerable in ' 91			0
however , he said , @entity4 's immensity poses more of a quandary for sailors			0
" the one i was in was different , because you could do something			0
in @entity4 , you ca n't do much , " @entity224 said			0

former owner @entity137 says he 's " deeply saddened " by the @entity11 's loss
a deckhand 's body has been found and the captain is missing
the @entity6 says 14 rescued crew members are " in good health "
the @entity11 was en route to @entity157 , @entity158 , when it sank in heavy seas
