-- the phrase " small soy latte liberalism " deserves to become the defining symbol of the failure of the @entity5			1
the @entity7 reference came from @entity9 's new mayor , @entity8			1
as his party 's putative presidential front - runner and her husband looked on , @entity8 put the incoherence of the modern left on full display in his inaugural address wednesday			1
after a mayoral campaign which emphasized boldness , radicalism , populism and the " new progressive " commitment to fighting income inequality , he revealed that after the rhetoric comes timidity , incoherence , and absurdity			0
mayor @entity8 promised to change @entity9 for the daily price of a small soy latte from @entity7			1
" we will ask the very wealthy to pay a little more in taxes so that we can offer full - day universal pre-k and after - school programs for every middle school student , " he said			0
" and when we say ' a little more , ' we can rightly emphasize the ' little			0
' " " those earning between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million a year , " the new mayor continued , " ... would see their taxes increase by an average of $ 973 a year			2
that 's less than three bucks a day -- about the cost of a small soy latte at your local @entity7			1
" it was sadly symbolic that mayor de @entity8 was speaking one week before the 50th anniversary of president @entity49 's declaration of a " @entity50			1
" look at the contrast between the mayor 's reassurance about tiny sacrifices and @entity49 's bold declaration in his @entity56 on january 8 , 1964			2
" it will not be a short or easy struggle , no single weapon or strategy will suffice , but we shall not rest until that war is won , " @entity49 pledged			0
" the richest nation on earth can afford to win it			0
we can not afford to lose it			0
" fifty years after the @entity50 began , the boldest declaration our new champion of liberalism can muster is that his own expansion of the welfare bureaucracy will cost the @entity9 elite no more than their daily dose of caffeine			1
oh , how the price to ease their consciences has fallen in half a century			2
and yet the poor are still impoverished			0
here are the facts : after 50 years and trillions of dollars , bureaucratic government has lost the war on poverty			0
each year , we spend $ 17,000 per person in poverty on means - tested welfare programs alone , as @entity88 points out			2
that adds up to more than $ 16 trillion since 1965			0
yet today , left - wing leaders like mayor @entity8 and president @entity91 still call inequality " the defining issue of our time			1
" what does this say about their welfare bureaucracies ? like @entity91 's small , recycled proposals to help poor @entity101 , @entity8 's " small soy latte " liberalism will grow bureaucracy and please bureaucratic unions but will not help win the war on poverty			1
their minor tinkering with the current welfare state will clearly fail , just as it has failed for decades , and yet minor tinkering is all that the chiefs of modern liberalism have to offer			1
as if to reassure us , they pledge that continuing the charade will cost just a little more			0
poor and disadvantaged @entity101 deserve a completely new approach to poverty -- one which has the courage to analyze the failures of the past 50 years			0
a focus on incentives , economic growth , and on helping the least well - off learn the skills they need to leave poverty would be a good start			1
poor @entity101 need a fundamental break from a system which has trapped so many in dependency			0
ironically , @entity8 has done us all a favor by being so clear about the small , timid , and ultimately hopeless efforts to use big bureaucracies to solve the real problems of impoverished @entity101			2
let 's say no to " small soy latte liberalism " and yes to profoundly rethinking the best way of helping our fellow citizens			1

@entity9 mayor proposes slight tax hike on high earners to fund *pre-school*
@entity8 said tax hike would equal daily price of a small soy latte
@entity139 : @entity149 tinkering with the welfare state has failed for decades
