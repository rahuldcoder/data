-- the three friends pointed the nose of their 31 - foot boat in the direction of the best fishing , near the oil rigs off the @entity8 coast			1
it was april 20 , a beautiful , calm morning			1
at around 9:45 p.m. , they looked out and saw what appeared , at first , like a flare			1
" man , this does n't look right , " he said to his buddies @entity18 and @entity20			1
@entity16 then reached for the boat 's radio to phone another rig			1
but then , over the airwaves : " @entity27 , @entity27 , @entity27 ! this is the @entity30 ! we are on fire ! we are abandoning the rig ! " then a boom , an explosion			1
the fishermen were 18 miles away			1
" it hit your chest , " @entity20 recalled			2
" it was like a plane flying real low , really fast , " said @entity18			2
" it shook the boat			2
i mean , we knew it was bad			2
" @entity16 radioed the @entity47			1
" ' please , how many people can you hold on [ your ] boat ? ' " he was asked			2
" ' we do n't know , you know , maybe 20 - 25 , we 've never , basically ... this is a fishing boat			1
i mean , we 've never put that many people on it ... they 're like ' please , please help ! ' @entity16 threw the throttle down			1
as the @entity59 sped toward the flames , they stowed their fishing gear and pulled out life jackets , floating pillows and rope			1
they put on life jackets			2
" we knew people were in the water , " @entity18 recalled			2
" we had to be ready to jump			2
" mayday calls crackled on the radio			2
the 20 minutes it took the fishermen get to the rig felt like forever			1
what are we going to see when we get there ? @entity16 thought			2
the men kept communicating with the @entity47 , describing their coordinates and what they were hearing over their radio as they closed in on @entity30			1
for a second , just a second , disbelief gripped them			2
@entity82 blazed across the water 's surface , jumping 500 feet			2
people were flailing in the current , hurt , screaming			2
others clung to life boats			2
" we 've got friends that are missing , " someone shouted			1
" please go search ! " the @entity30 was enormous , its destruction so vast that the friends had to keep using their binoculars			1
" you 'd see something floating in the water and we 'd go up and try to find out what it was			0
you know , is it a person ? " @entity16 recalled			0
it would turn out to be debris			0
the fire was so loud			0
they worried there was something under the boat			0
@entity16 thought : is the rig gon na explode some more and send debris our way ? @entity18 stood on the bow , and shouted to a man in a life boat			1
" who 's in charge ? what do we need to do ? we 're trying to help			0
we 've got to have some direction			1
" he got no answer			0
the @entity47 was still not there			1
was it hours later ? it was			0
crew and supply boats eventually arrived			1
when their job was done , the fishermen , wordless , exhausted , returned to shore			0
months after the explosion , @entity20 is haunted by what he saw			0
a veteran deck hand , he had once experienced a fire on a charter boat			0
by comparison , @entity138 's was like an inferno			1
" you do n't know the chills that went through me when i heard a @entity27 ... a vessel in distress working on the water is bad enough , a @entity27 -- that 's life and death , " he said			0
" could we have done more ? " @entity20 asks himself			0
" there 's a sense of guilt even though we did all we could			0
" when he got home after that night -- some 36 or 40 hours later -- he said he needed his wife			0
she 's all he wanted			0
he fell asleep crying in her arms			0
@entity20 , who is now working to clean up the oil , constantly thinks about those frantic hours			0
he wonders , what if they had chosen to fish closer to the @entity30 ? " we could have been sitting under that rig , " @entity20 said			1
" we could have been on the victims ' list			0
" he said he 's taking anti-anxiety medications and though he rarely fought with his wife , he says he 's gotten short with her lately			0
only adding to the stress , @entity20 said , the @entity168 oil spill has destroyed his charter ship business			1
all the friends are weary , just as anyone in the @entity172 , added @entity16			1
" we 've gone through @entity173 , @entity174 and failing economies , from collapsing real estate markets , and , you know , you 've got to deal with this ? " he said			1
" how much more do you have to put up with ? ... it really angers you , it really makes you just sick to your damn stomach			0
" even more insulting , the friends say , is that they have not received a reply from @entity168 or @entity184 after numerous attempts -- as early as three days after their heroic efforts -- to share what they witnessed with the companies			1
they have left messages with @entity168 and @entity184 's hot lines and claims departments and sent e-mails to the companies , @entity16 said			1
" ' hey guys , we were there			0
can we tell ya what we saw ? can we , you know ... i may have information that can help ya 'll out , ' " @entity16 said , describing his messages			0
no one 's ever called us back			0
" the men say they plan to sue @entity168 for emotional distress			1
@entity168 did not respond to attempts by " @entity208 " to get a comment for this story			1
" you know , those guys out there that night on the ... on the rig ... , " said @entity18			0
" they thanked us , " @entity20 said			0
the three men who have made their life in the @entity172 , who know rig workers , want this : no one should forget the men who were killed that day			1
" there 's 11 families that i assume do n't have a father , do n't have a husband ... " said @entity20			0
" [ that 's ] not supposed to happen when you go to work			0
" " @entity208 " producer @entity229 contributed to this report			0
