-- a former communist - era naval base in east @entity2 could soon become the most important new @entity4 superyacht hub in decades			1
@entity6 marina is being developed in the @entity7 in southern @entity6 , the tiny former - yugoslav nation , a region with the lowest gdp in @entity2			1
it is the brainchild of multi-millionaire gold miner @entity10 who hopes his plans will turn this area into a glamorous and economically thriving hotspot to rival the likes of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
to this end , the bay , with its picturesque mountains , is undergoing a transformation that will leave it decorated with luxury penthouses , upmarket shopping boulevards and the capacity to hold 600 yachts in its harbor			2
but despite the grandness of the development , it was not so long ago that 82 - year - old @entity33 , thought the scheme an impossible dream			1
" i never thought i 'd have the opportunity to put all this into practice , " said @entity36 , who is ceo of @entity37 , the world 's largest gold mining company			2
" where would i get the chance to create the perfect port in @entity2 , somewhere that 's large and protected , where the water is deep and where the government is co-operating ? it would be a chance in a million , " he said			2
so how did he get from notions of a " fantasy port " to the very real @entity6 development ? it was some chance comments that piqued his interest back in 2000 , in his former role as chairman and ceo of the largest @entity63 / @entity62 real - estate firm @entity61 , which had interests throughout @entity2			1
advisors recommended having a look at @entity6 , in those days part of the rump of former @entity69			1
" the @entity63 ambassador in @entity71 also recommended it to me			2
he said i should have a look next time i 'm in @entity2 , " he says			2
in 2003 , he was flown in a government helicopter over the @entity7			2
this huge , mountain - fringed harbor had been hidden from view for decades , during its time housing the @entity81 naval base , home of the @entity69 navy			1
foreign charts were out of date and there had been a 30 - mile no - fly zone over the bay			1
the location was for many years , quite literally , off the radar			0
when @entity36 saw the bay he was gobsmacked			0
i 'd never seen anywhere as beautiful in my life , " he said			0
this was the virgin territory he had been waiting for and he met with @entity98 prime minister , @entity97 , who told him that they were keen to privatize some military assets , including the base at @entity81			1
@entity102 came the money : " that was easy			0
i just got some friends involved			0
" today , @entity6 is making strides , with phase one complete and over 85 boats of all sizes in place			1
" our investment is a transformational investment , not just of the base , but of the country , " says @entity33			1
the first fruits of this can be seen with a range of developments in the region -- hotels -- built to planning restrictions that mean this will hopefully not become yet another concrete jungle -- a golf course , and international flights to @entity125			1
" people have seen that if we can attract hundreds of yachts it will open up the whole country			0
they see the wealth that comes from the big yachts , which provide the employment , the foreign currency , the purchasing power			0
" he adds : " we 're not taking a dollar out			0
we 're putting in an infrastructure , we 're educating , we 're attracting other investors			0
we 're creating roads , buildings , pure water , an image			0
" we 're investing hundreds of millions of dollars			0
in the meantime 60 to 70 @entity98 can work for us directly at an income level unknown under communism			0
