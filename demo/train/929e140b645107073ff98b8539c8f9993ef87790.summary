the greatest sports franchises in the world all share one thing in common : superfans so passionate they will travel far and wide to watch their teams exult in victory			1
@entity7 has experienced all of the travel and exactly none of the joy			1
when the 32 - year - old @entity13 lifer first drummed up the plan to follow his beloved @entity16 team at every stop -- including @entity18 -- for an entire season , he had no idea it would be a historic one			1
sadly for him , it was historic for all the wrong reasons			0
" this is the worst basketball that i 've seen this season , " says @entity7 , while exiting the @entity25 after the @entity13 were blown out by the @entity26 for their 16th loss in a row			1
@entity7 arrived in @entity18 ( via @entity31 ) on saturday to watch the @entity13 as part of the @entity16 's @entity34 initiative			1
" i was hoping they would win close to 40 games , sneak into the playoffs and see what could happen , " he says			0
instead , the @entity13 are on course to have their worst season in franchise history with a 5 -- 36 record at the halfway mark			1
the failure is extreme , even for a team that has battled a revolving door of personnel changes and off - court controversy for well over a decade			0
during the off season , the @entity13 hired @entity50 to run its front office -- unchartered territory for the legendary former coach			1
his first move was to appoint his long - serving @entity56 point - guard @entity55 as a rookie head coach			0
both , it appears , are learning on the job at the expense of fans who pay the highest ticket prices in the league			0
for @entity7 , however , supporting the @entity13 is practically out of his hands			1
" if it were possible i would have left the team about 10 years ago , " he says , referring to an era that included crippling player contracts along with an in - house sexual harassment charge against then - coach and general manager @entity69			0
" so i 've given up trying to get a divorce , we 're stuck together ... unfortunately			0
" in @entity18 , he will attend his first @entity76 football match at his adopted team of @entity78 on saturday			0
" i ended up choosing the team most like the @entity13 , " @entity7 explains			1
" they are from a big city , but have a history of disappointment			0
there 's something that resonated with me in that			0
" rather than sport a lucky jersey like most super fans , @entity7 wears an unlucky jersey , @entity91 's number 7 , which he bought after the third game of the season when the @entity13 had a record of 2 - 1			1
they have won only three games and lost 35 since			0
" it 's a tough season , so we really appreciate his effort of trying to see all of our games , " says @entity96 , the @entity13 @entity97 point guard and @entity7 's favorite current player			1
" you know i feel a little bit sad , not only for him , but for all @entity13 fans around the world , " @entity96 explains			1
" because of course we never expected this kind of season ; but by now we are in the middle of deep changes , so i think in the future the team will be much better			0
" @entity7 , who went to law school at @entity114 , received a pink slip from his law firm on the same day the @entity13 announced @entity50 's hire			1
he took it as a sign			0
after talking it over with his sister @entity121 , a life coach in @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity7 paid $ 3,500 for a season 's worth of middle - tier corner seats at @entity127 and began plotting his six month odyssey			1
including away tickets , which he paid for in advance -- " i probably could have gotten a discount if i had waited to see how bad they are , " he laments -- along with flights and accommodation , the experience has set him back $ 25,000			1
" it 's a crazy amount of money , i understand that , " he says , between sips of @entity141 at an oak - infused pub in @entity144 , west @entity18			0
" but a lot of people in my position will travel the world			0
lawyers burn themselves out , they take a year off , and spend a good deal of money			0
this is my version of that			0
" @entity7 , who says there was " an element of relief " in getting fired , is using the time off to hone his writing skills on his travel blog and has already signed with a book agent			2
a great fan of @entity163 's " @entity162 , " he intends to write a memoir about the @entity13 ' season in the same vein , minus the trophy ending			1
in some ways he sees the @entity13 ' moribund season as a perverse blessing in disguise			2
" i think it is infinitely more interesting to write about a really , really bad team then to write about a mediocre team , or even a really good team			0
" right away there is a certain interest , a morbid curiosity			1
" although the @entity13 often trail by double figures early ( the @entity26 took a 14 - 0 lead on thursday , and were ahead by 20 points in the second quarter ) , @entity7 says he tries to remain focused at least until the end of the third quarter			1
sometimes , however , the losing is just too hard to take			2
" at a certain point , it 's like watching a small animal get tortured and there 's no reason to continue to subject myself to that kind of pain , " he says			1
outside of the arenas , he resists the psychological pull of returning to life as a lawyer , sometimes from the most unexpected places			0
in @entity198 , prominent personal injury attorney @entity197 invited @entity7 to sit courtside with him , but on one condition			2
" i had to sit and listen to him explain why i was making a mistake by leaving the practice of law , " says @entity7 , who became aware that the vip experience was a subtle recruiting effort			2
even other extreme fans find @entity7 's mission unattainable			2
" that 's a lot more hardcore than i am , " says @entity207 , a 35 - year - old @entity26 faithful , who flew in from @entity208 and spent $ 750 on a floor seat to see the @entity18 game			2
" he got fired , he spent his savings watching a horrible team lose			2
that 's a diehard fan			2
" nevertheless , @entity7 admits that he 'll be relieved once the season is over , and doubts he 'll renew his season ticket even though he thinks the @entity13 can become a playoff team next season			1
" i do n't think i 'll be able to afford it , " he shrugs			0
there 's one more reason why he 's not renewing			0
" i miss watching it on tv , " he says .			2

fan spends $ 25,000 to watch @entity13 ' epic losing streak
traveling far and wide , @entity7 gets no respite
only " morbid curiosity " keeps him coming back for more
run of losses " like watching a small animal get tortured , " says @entity7
