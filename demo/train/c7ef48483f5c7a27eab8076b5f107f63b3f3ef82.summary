-- two @entity2 crew members will head out saturday morning for a spacewalk to address an ammonia leak in the orbiter 's cooling system , an emergency that forced @entity9 officials to work round - the - clock to hatch a plan			1
first detected early thursday morning , the leak was causing ammonia to enter space -- which could be seen in the form of " flakes of snow " -- at a rate of 5 pounds per day , said @entity19 , @entity9 's space station program manager			1
ammonia is used to cool each of the solar arrays that provide electricity to station systems			2
the discovery spurred teams at @entity9 , over a busy 24 - hour stretch , to go into " a full - court press to understand what the failure is " and how to address it , @entity9 flight director @entity26 said at a friday news conference			0
the space station 's six - man crew is in " good spirits " in anticipation of the spacewalk , added @entity26 , a sentiment echoed by a tweet friday afternoon by its commander			1
" this type of event is what the years of training were for , " wrote @entity43			1
" a happy , busy crew , working hard , loving life in space			0
" hours earlier , @entity48 wrote on @entity53 that his crew was planning for a saturday spacewalk to be conducted by @entity9 astronauts @entity57 and @entity58			1
@entity48 -- who is with the @entity59 -- spent friday preparing for his role as choreographer of the spacewalk , while @entity57 and @entity58 worked in an airlock to check out the spacesuits they will wear in space , among other tasks			0
@entity57 and @entity58 have done two spacewalks apiece , working together both times in 2009 while on a space shuttle @entity70 to the space station			2
" since the crew is prepared and our ops team is ready to go , we 're going to try to get them outside , " said @entity19			0
scheduled to wake up at 2 a.m. et , the astronauts will begin their formal preparations about 1 hour and 15 minutes later , @entity26 said			0
a hatch will open around 8:15 a.m. , sometime after which @entity57 and @entity58 will start moving along a truss the 150 feet out to the site of the leak on the space station 's @entity85 segment			1
once there , @entity26 explained , the astronauts will do a " visual inspection " of the leak -- the location of which space agency officials have " narrowed down " thanks to imagery , though @entity19 notes any cracks may be " very , very small			0
" they will also check and possibly replace a pump controller box on the truss , which @entity9 explains is " the oldest component of the station 's backbone			2
" the entire walk is expected to take about 6Â½ hours			2
the space station 's crew , which also includes three @entity104 cosmonauts , is not in danger from the leak , @entity9 has said			1
moreover , the agency has said the rest of the orbiter is otherwise operating normally			0
the leak is in a cooling loop in a solar array that has leaked before			1
@entity9 said crew members tried to fix a leak in november			0
it 's unclear whether this is the same leak or a new one			0
the ammonia coolant for the power channel , one of eight used to supply electricity to the station , is likely to run out by late friday morning and it will be shut down , @entity9 said			1
" it is a serious situation , but between crew and experts on the ground , it appears to have been stabilized , " @entity48 tweeted thursday			0
in the friday news conference , @entity9 's @entity19 said the spacewalk and ammonia leak wo n't affect the departure -- scheduled for monday at 7:08 p.m. et -- of @entity131 , @entity58 and @entity104 cosmonaut @entity132			1
three crew members , @entity57 and @entity104 cosmonauts @entity135 and @entity136 , will remain on the space station when the others leave			2
they will be joined at the end of the month by three new crew members : @entity9 astronaut @entity142 , @entity104 cosmonaut @entity143 and @entity144 astronaut @entity141 , who are due to launch aboard a @entity104 soyuz spacecraft on may 28 .			0

new : @entity9 says the spacewalk will start saturday morning and last 6Â½ hours
ammonia is leaking from a cooling loop on a solar array on the space station
it was *spotted* thursday , and officials have worked round - the - clock since to devise a plan
