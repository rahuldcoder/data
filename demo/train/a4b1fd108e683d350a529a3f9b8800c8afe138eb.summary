-- when @entity2 pick up their prescriptions from the pharmacy or reach for a prescription bottle from their medicine cabinet , they probably do n't think much about where the drugs were made or whether they are safe			1
what most @entity2 do n't realize is the staggering fact that the number of drug products manufactured outside the @entity2 has doubled between 2001 and 2008			2
nearly 40 % of all drugs taken by @entity2 come from overseas , and nearly 80 % of the active pharmaceutical ingredients used to make these drugs also come from foreign countries -- mainly @entity17 and @entity18			1
i support the global marketplace , but we must be aware that without the proper enforcement of quality standards , the trust we put in the safety of the prescriptions we take can be broken at any time by a supplier in @entity17 , a counterfeiter in @entity18 or an importer from @entity31			1
too many people believe incorrectly that the @entity33 has the authority to properly monitor our drug supply system for safety			1
under current law , the @entity33 does not have the authority to require a manufacturer to notify the agency if a drug has been corrupted , to recall pharmaceuticals that the @entity33 believes are unsafe , to refuse imported pharmaceuticals that are counterfeited at the border or to ensure that drug manufacturers are responsible for quality controls throughout their supply chain			1
these are authorities we must give to @entity33 if we are to truly oversee the safety of our drug supply			2
even more worrisome is the inability of the @entity33 to conduct comparable inspections of domestic and foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers			2
it lacks the necessary funding and personnel			2
domestic pharmaceutical facilities are inspected , on average , every two years by the @entity33 , whereas foreign drug facilities are inspected only every nine years			0
according to the @entity60 , some of the 3,765 foreign drug establishments in the @entity33 's database may never have been inspected			0
an increasing demand , coupled with an expanding globalized drug market , blatantly calls for a more globalized and fully equipped @entity33			0
a globalized @entity33 not only would ensure safety ; it would also level the playing field for our manufacturers			1
@entity33 approval is the gold standard in the world marketplace : domestic pharmaceutical and ingredient manufacturers in the @entity2 are held to that high standard			1
their foreign counterparts should be , too			0
these competitors are from countries like @entity18 and @entity17 , nations that are home to 70 % of the world 's drug manufacturing sites , up from just 49 % in 2004			1
now , more than ever , @entity2 manufacturing facilities should be rewarded , not penalized , for retaining jobs in the @entity2			0
it is not only fair and the right thing to do to protect @entity2 competitiveness , it 's critically important for the health of @entity2 consumers			0
although improved drug safety authorities for the @entity33 are important , they will be ineffective without a reliable funding stream , free from political whims , to implement them			1
a chronically underfunded agency , like the @entity33 , can not successfully oversee our drug supply 's safety without a stable funding source that will allow the agency to hire the staff it needs to conduct inspections overseas or to monitor pharmaceuticals that are entering our country			1
the re-authorization of the @entity104 , which expires in october , offers an opportunity to remedy these problems			0
as we begin debate and negotiations around the @entity104 , we have a responsibility to ensure that we are equipping the @entity33 with the resources , personnel and authorities to assure the pharmaceuticals @entity2 take every day are neither contaminated , counterfeited , corrupted nor mislabeled			1
it is hard to believe that it already has been three years since the contaminated blood thinner heparin , which authorities believe originated in @entity17 , killed several people and caused multiple cases of serious illness			2
although fears generated by this crisis may have subsided , the reality that it can happen again should be fresh in the minds of those of us on the @entity127 as we reauthorize the @entity104 , and give the @entity33 more authority in the process			2
this is not and should not be a partisan issue			0
we must focus not only on making , and ensuring timely access to , the latest innovative drug treatments , but on establishing one quality standard for every drug sold in the @entity2			0
@entity2 consumers , and their families , deserve no less			0
join the conversation on @entity139			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity142 .			0

@entity142 : 40 % of drugs , 80 % of ingredients are from overseas , mainly @entity17 , @entity18
we have no monitoring system to *prevent* counterfeit or contaminated drugs , he writes
@entity142 : the @entity33 lacks the authorization to ensure these drugs meet @entity2 standards
we need to pass *legislation* that gives @entity33 proper funding and authority , he says
