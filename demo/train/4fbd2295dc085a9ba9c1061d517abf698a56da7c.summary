" @entity5 ! " exclaimed sister @entity0 , as she described @entity2 's new museum dedicated to its revered hometown boy , pope @entity4 his enthusiasm for his faith and his country radiates through this rural town in southern @entity10			1
and in the spring sunshine @entity11 reminds me of how and why @entity10 has defied historical odds and emerged as a stable , dynamic country in the heart of @entity17			1
sister @entity18 tells me @entity4 made patriotism part and parcel of the fourth commandment , honor and love thy parents			2
she says the pope encouraged @entity10 people to love their country and believe in its potential			1
there is much debate both inside and outside @entity10 on whether the pope 's influence was ever political or revolutionary			1
but listening to @entity18 , the debate softens and blurs and what emerges is pure gratitude			0
many people here say they are thankful history bestowed them a @entity10 pope that embodied their aspirations			2
a quarter century ago , the solidarity movement led a bold , brave path to independence and yet it was a movement so nuanced and profound , it 's perhaps better appreciated with hindsight			0
or maybe on a stroll through the main square in @entity2			0
the square has been rebuilt , the church where the pope worshipped has been restored and renewed			0
a papal museum dedicated to the life of @entity4 sits prominently on the square , packed with visitors from all over the world			0
we speak with @entity10 families on a sunday stroll , @entity60 tourists on a pilgrimage to the former pope 's homeland and tourists from the @entity65 eager to learn more about the pope 's early life			2
all comment on @entity10 's independence and prosperity and how @entity4 seems still to be the guardian of their freedom			1
with one of the fastest growing economies in @entity17 , a stable democracy and a dynamic workforce , @entity10 has indeed made revolution look easy , even inevitable			0
but the chaotic and violent revolutions around the world in recent years are a reminder of how difficult political change can be and why @entity10 's has been so extraordinary			1
to be sure , @entity10 has been guided by the steady hand of @entity84 and more importantly , its economic aid			0
but it 's the voices of @entity88 leaders 25 years ago that still resonate			1
pope @entity4 was not always vocal or strident about the situation in @entity10 or how it should change , but his return to his homeland in 1979 as pope seemed to summon the confidence @entity10 people always knew they had			1
even those not yet born in 1979 tell us his visit was a catalyst giving @entity10 the courage and faith to push ahead with its protest and the peoples ' demand for freedom and independence			2
all these details have been written and rewritten in modern history countless times , but it is on our visit to @entity10 that we really saw their significance			0
in @entity2 's sunny square , in @entity116 's modern football stadium , in @entity114 's renewed skyline , we have found an emboldened country humbled by its historical leaders and thankful for the future they 've inspired			2
what do you like the most about @entity10 ? read more : unearthed ! but is it a vampire ?			0
