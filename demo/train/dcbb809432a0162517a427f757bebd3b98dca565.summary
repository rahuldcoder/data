-- the mother of one of two men accused of shooting and killing three african - americans in @entity5 , @entity6 , earlier this month said tuesday her son was " a very good kid			1
" " i 'm still devastated from the news			0
i ca n't wrap my head around that , " @entity9 told @entity0 from the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity6			0
she 's serving an 18 - year sentence on an arson conviction			2
@entity17 's son , @entity18 , and his friend , @entity19 , are accused of first - degree murder and other charges in the april 6 shooting spree , which came a day after he posted a message lamenting his father 's death two years earlier " at the hands of a f -- king n --- - r. " a judge on monday entered not guilty pleas for the men and ordered them held without bond pending a may 30 preliminary hearing			1
@entity35 's attorney , @entity34 , reiterated tuesday that @entity35 , 19 , is not a racist , despite the posting			1
" the fact that he uses that term and is comfortable in using that term in describing in a real derogatory fashion one person does not make him a racist , " @entity34 said			0
" he used the most derogatory term he could in describing the person who shot his dad in the heart			0
" @entity34 took the case after @entity35 's mother wrote an impassioned plea for her son 's defense from prison			1
his office released a jailhouse interview monday recorded by the legal team in which @entity35 spoke of the trauma of seeing his father killed and his girlfriend commit suicide in front of him , as well as troubles with depression			2
in the video , @entity35 also talked of growing up and living in @entity5 , which has a large @entity68 - @entity68 community , and said he had friends of all races			1
" i always got along with everybody , " he said in the video , which was recorded last friday			0
" it did n't matter what color he was			0
" the language in the @entity77 post was used " just to express how i was upset at the guy who shot my dad , " @entity35 said in the interview , adding that was the only time he had used the derogatory term to describe someone			1
that view is starkly different from the portrayal of @entity35 and @entity19 , 33 , that has been offered by authorities			1
authorities say the two went into a largely @entity68 section of @entity5 after midnight april 6 , killing three people and wounding two others			1
police have said the two confessed to the killings shortly after their arrest			0
all the shooting victims were black			0
police have identified @entity19 and @entity35 as white , though the probable cause affidavit released friday noted @entity35 was a co-owner of a truck that had @entity102 license plates			1
three @entity104 tips helped lead authorities to the men , according to the affidavit			0
in the first , made last saturday , a caller described @entity35 as " a racist ( who ) hates black males " and said he had " bragged about other shootings			2
" another person phoned to say that @entity35 had gone off to burn his truck , which was similar to the vehicle seen by several people -- including one of the survivors -- in and around the area where the shootings took place			2
sheriff deputies soon after found a 1989 @entity123 truck with the @entity102 tag on fire in @entity5			2
the third caller to contact @entity104 on april 7 said @entity35 had " made several comments about killing black people " and wanted " justice " for his father 's killing			1
this person added that @entity35 " uses drugs and will not go down without a fight			2
" in addition to the first - degree murder charges , @entity19 and @entity35 also face two counts of shooting with intent to kill and five counts of malicious harassment -- the equivalent of a hate crime under @entity6 law			1
the law makes it illegal to " maliciously and with the specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person 's race , color , religion , ancestry , national origin or disability			0
" prosecutors have not yet announced if they plan to seek the death penalty on the murder charges			1
the @entity157 is investigating the shootings to determine if federal civil rights laws were violated			0
@entity0 's @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
