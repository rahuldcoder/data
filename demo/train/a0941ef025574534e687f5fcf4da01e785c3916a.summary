-- the good news is that you 'll still be allowed to look out the window			0
the melancholy news is that you probably wo n't want to			0
both @entity6 and @entity7 are in the midst of aggressive programs to install and expand free @entity11 service on their trains and buses			1
according to figures provided by officials of both companies , @entity6 and @entity7 , between them , carry around 50 million passengers a year on intercity routes			1
" our passengers tell us that they love to be able to use their computers for free as they travel , " said @entity6 spokeswoman @entity19			1
" our passengers enjoy it a lot , " said @entity7 spokesman @entity23			1
@entity19 and @entity23 undoubtedly are being truthful			0
for generations , it was taken as an article of faith that baseball was the national pastime			0
but several decades ago a wise social observer noted that baseball was n't the national pastime at all ; watching television had become the national pastime			0
and now -- it 's difficult to argue with this -- gazing at computer ( or mobile telephone ) screens has become the national pastime , whether we want it to be or not			2
it 's how we pass the time			2
" all of our new coaches have @entity11 , and it 's our plan to make it systemwide , " said @entity7 's @entity23			1
( @entity51 discount - priced bus lines have featured @entity11 for some time			1
) @entity6 's @entity19 said the @entity61 trains on the @entity62 already have free @entity11 , as do the downeaster trains ( between @entity64 , @entity65 , and @entity66 , @entity67 ) , the @entity59 ( between @entity52 , @entity53 , and @entity54 , @entity55 ) and the @entity56 ( between @entity57 , @entity55 , and @entity58 , @entity55 )			1
" it is @entity6 's vision to outfit all of its services with @entity11 over the next few years as funding becomes available , " she said			1
there is an undeniable logic to that			0
jet airliners are a much faster way to get from one part of the @entity78 to another ; trains and buses take considerably longer , and passengers can grow weary and bored			1
allowing them to connect to the internet , especially when it 's free , would seem to be a way to make the miles zip by			2
so what will be lost ? journeys on @entity6 and @entity7 have , by default , been the last , best way to really look at @entity78 block by block , neighborhood by neighborhood , mile by mile			1
if you were driving your own car on a long trip , you mostly had your eyes on the highway ahead ; if you were flying , you were above the clouds			0
but on the train or on the bus you had little choice but to look out the window and take in the country as it rolled by			0
you could read a magazine or work on a crossword puzzle or knit , but those were things you could just as easily do at home			0
moving from state to state at ground level felt different			0
on @entity6 especially , if you booked a compartment in one of the sleeper cars , your window had the approximate relative dimensions of a television screen : you could lean back and let the nation unfurl in front of you			1
it was like a visual novel , a freeform silent movie ; it was like passing through @entity78 's endless backyard			1
it was the @entity78 in a way you had allowed yourself to almost forget about			2
the one - of - a - kind storefronts , the people talking on small - town corners , the meticulously tended gardens , the lights in the windows waiting for someone to come home at the end of an evening -- they have always been there , but in our hurried daily lives we sometimes cease to pay attention			0
on the train or on the bus , paying attention was often the ideal option , the best way to deal with the tedium , and the whole thing could be unexpectedly lovely			0
it was the nicest traveler 's perk of all			2
it still can be , of course ; as @entity7 's @entity23 said , " you always have the choice			1
" but if recent social history has taught us anything , it 's that the actual world around us is frequently no match for the seductiveness of a screen			0
if you need proof of that , it 's right in front of you on any city street , as people stroll along oblivious to their immediate surroundings , their eyes locked on the information being delivered to them on their phones and handheld devices			1
we seem to have become hopelessly addicted			0
so you can bet that , as the trains and interstate buses eventually are all fitted for complimentary @entity11 , and as the technical kinks are worked out and the connectivity becomes close to seamless , passengers will become accustomed to logging on to the internet from before they even pull out of the station until the moment they arrive at their destination			1
there 's no disputing that , in a fundamental way , this is progress ; it will make the miles and hours seem to go by more quickly , it will allow passengers to feel they have not really left the world from which they have just departed , it will keep them tethered and productive			2
it will give the welcome illusion of shortening the journey			0
and maybe once in a while , as they look up from the computer for a moment and glance out the window -- at a friday night football game in a town they 've never passed through before and will never pass through again , at a diner whose owner is unlocking and opening the front door as the first tentative rays of one more dawn have just begun to glow , at the tired expression on the face of a motorist alone in his car at a railroad crossing , waiting patiently for the @entity6 train to speed by so he can get to wherever he needs to be			2
... maybe , once in a while , the people on the train or on the bus will gratefully take in the greatest free show of all , the one that is n't delivered out of the ether and onto a screen , the one that once was referred to as life			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity237 .			2

@entity237 says @entity6 and @entity7 are bringing @entity11 to their 50 million passengers
trains and buses need a way to compete with planes ; @entity11 may be an answer , writes @entity237
trains and buses were a way to experience " @entity78 's backyard , " writes @entity237
he says we have become oblivious to our surroundings *due* to *technology*
