-- the heady days of @entity1 epitomized by @entity3 excess and rampant wealth may seem a far - flung memory , but the city still retains its buzz , its high - octane spirit that is the essence of its magical personality as a place where anything can happen			1
the original 24 hour city , but still the best ? you can turn a trip to @entity1 into anything you want it to be			1
@entity1 remains firmly in first place as the world 's 24 hour city , with nearly anything accessible at any hour			1
there is a frustratingly vast number of sights to see , places to eat , shopping , partying and serious cultural gems dotted throughout the place			1
so many films , books , television shows and musicians have personified @entity1 that it 's hard not to feel you already know it before you arrive			1
while many of those stereotypes ring true , entering the city -- whether the first or twentieth time -- with an open mind will make each visit seem an adventure			1
at first , the glittering , noisy and even rude aspect of the city may send timid visitors running			1
look below the surface and you may see more than just shimmering skyscrapers and neatly manicured inhabitants but a multifarious bunch of people somehow co-existing astonishing well within the city 's grid structure			2
despite their sometimes alarming candor , @entity1 are as much a part of the city 's entertainment as catching a @entity58 show			1
a starting point for 24 hours in the city should begin with breakfast or brunch @entity1 style : eggs ( however you 'd like ) and some good strong coffee to charge you up for the day			1
almost every corner of @entity67 has a local diner , otherwise head downtown to breakfast stalwarts @entity71 in @entity72 , or more recent favorite new @entity73 in the @entity74			1
continue south to @entity67 , with an excursion on the free , 25 - minute ( each way ) @entity78 ferry			1
the views of downtown , the @entity79 , and @entity80 give a closer glimpse of what it must have been like to arrive in the city as an immigrant in days past			0
next head up to lively @entity87 to shop and bargain for knock - off designer handbags and various tat around @entity92			1
if feeling peckish , have dim sum at @entity94 , known for its no - frills decor and delicious dumplings			0
or continue on to @entity97 ( via @entity98 ) to lunch at cool , low - key @entity100 , or in @entity101 at the beautiful @entity73 restaurant @entity103 ( often a hangout of celebs )			0
shoppers will want to save time for the boutiques of @entity97 and the higher - end designer shops in @entity101			1
if strolling is your thing , do n't miss the opportunity to wander the leafy , village - like streets of the @entity74			0
loads of tiny boutiques ( many of which have gone high - end in years past ) , inviting sidewalk cafes and the general laid - back style of the place seem the perfect antidote to otherwise hectic areas of town			0
art enthusiasts should head straight to @entity128 next , where there are enough galleries to spend several days			0
the @entity131 is home to @entity1 's contemporary art scene and sits over near the @entity134 , spanning several streets going north			2
outdoor lovers will also be enticed to the @entity138 neighborhood as the @entity139 is opening in june 2009			0
the former elevated railroad has been converted into a park including floating ponds , sundecks and lookout spots over the @entity134 and @entity67			2
one of the city 's most exciting recent projects , the public park will span 22 blocks ( once it 's all open in 2010 ) , a huge accomplishment after many locals fought for years to turn it into green space			0
after a rest in the park , take in @entity154 for its neck - wrenching skyscrapers			0
admire the @entity156 , the city 's homage to art deco , and gape up at the city 's tallest building , the @entity162			0
stop in @entity163 , taking note of its @entity166 beauty and its constellation - inspired ceiling , where you may have time to sneak a drink in the tucked away , wood - paneled @entity172 bar			2
then admire the nineteen buildings comprising @entity174 , before glimpsing at @entity175 across the street			0
( shoppers beware : the temptations of @entity180 shops and department stores may pull you off schedule here )			0
if your feet can still keep up the pace , stroll up to @entity188 , for a glimpse of @entity1 oasis of green			2
a variety of activities in the park will amuse you , from sporty rollerbladers dancing around to the peaceful @entity196 where you can rest			0
cultural buffs should head up the park 's east side to the @entity200 it could easily command several hours if not days , but if short on time choose one section			2
all nearby , the @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 are each possible on their own in an hour or two			0
time for a tea or coffee break ? visit the pretty @entity208 inside the @entity209 , or stop in for a chi - chi cocktail at the @entity211 nearby			2
for a classic @entity1 dining experience in an elegant setting , end the perfect @entity1 day at @entity214 before retiring to a nearby bar for a nightcap			1
otherwise , if a @entity58 show is on the agenda , visit @entity219 by night , taking in the dazzling lights and mayhem of @entity1 's entertainment district			2
for cheap theater tickets , visit either the tkts booth in @entity219 at @entity225 and @entity58 , or call ahead to the selected theater to see if last - minute " rush " tickets are available			0
another option , head downtown to hear some jazz in @entity232 at the @entity233 or the @entity234 , or take in some drinks in one of many of @entity1 's watering holes			1
a few favorites include @entity239 in the @entity240 , @entity241 in the @entity242 or @entity243 in @entity97 .			0

the original 24 - hour city has plenty of offer for first - or tenth - time visitors
fuel up for the day with a typical @entity1 breakfast and head to lower @entity67
*mid-town* sights and shopping can *provide* plenty to delight and distract
it remains an *international* city where you can make your own adventures
