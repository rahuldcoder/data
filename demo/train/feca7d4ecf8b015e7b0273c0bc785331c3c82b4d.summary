@entity2 the terrorist attacks in @entity1 last week have revealed serious breaches and lapses in the @entity1 system of intelligence , surveillance and security , according to numerous counterterrorism experts , including former government officials			1
the rips in the so - called intelligence " net " reveal gaps that led directly to the tragic events that have gripped @entity2 and the rest of @entity1 for days and also raise serious security concerns for the future here and abroad , more than a half dozen experts on security and terrorism told @entity3			1
and it could n't come at a worse time			2
the brazen murders of 17 innocent people , in three separate attacks in as many days , has led to a fabled city shaken , shocked and in mourning			2
the new concerns raise the serious possibility that national security and surveillance of suspected terrorists in @entity1 will need to be increased or totally reviewed and revamped to provide better safety for the nation as a whole , some experts told @entity3			1
and with one of the suspected terrorists still on the loose of as sunday night and new reports of " sleeper cells " being activated , the security concerns are only amplified			2
on saturday , @entity1 police were told in a briefing that sleeper cells have been activated over the past 24 hours inside @entity1 , terror expert @entity45 said he had been told by a police source			1
he said officers were told to erase all visible online presence on social media and keep their weapons on themselves at all times , he said			2
" there is a huge security failure those people were all considered as extremely dangerous , " said @entity45 , a @entity1 expert who has written several books on terror groups , their actions and jihadism			1
" they were all supposed to be monitored			2
in the @entity64 , they were on a no - fly list			1
so we can ask the question whether the @entity64 is more able to monitor @entity1 jihadis on @entity1 territory than the @entity1 intelligence itself , " said @entity45			1
one of the most common complaints heard by experts : simple math showing aspiring terrorists in @entity1 having the upper hand			1
one former director of a @entity1 counterterrorism unit put it in these terms : " there are far too many of them , and far too few of us , " he said , asking to speak anonymously because he did not have permission to speak to reporters			1
" we can not possibly keep track of them all , and we are seriously outnumbered , " he said			2
two other former @entity1 terrorist officials agreed			1
@entity88 , head of the @entity89 , put it like this : " to put someone under surveillance , you need two things			2
you need a good reason -- you need to believe someone is going to be radicalized , that someone is going to become violent			2
" the second thing you need is resources			0
you need 25 agents ... to survey them physically , his phone , his laptops , @entity105 whatever			0
it is virtually impossible to put surveillance on 3,000 to 5,000 people in @entity1 who we know now are radicalized , " he said			1
beyond concerns about the state of simple surveillance , experts point out other issues in the fight against terrorism			0
they 're worried about the proliferation of jihadi videos on social media , the growth of radical jihadi preaching and the relative ease with which citizens of @entity1 can get into @entity126 and across the @entity128 border			1
the week of terror began at the offices of @entity131 , where 12 journalists and others were murdered in close quarters , leaving a gruesome and violent crime scene behind the likes of which @entity2 has not seen in years			0
the attackers were two brothers who were well - known to authorities and who would seemingly call out for increased surveillance and scrutiny			2
@entity142 and @entity143 were orphans and had criminal records			0
the younger brother , @entity142 , was actually prosecuted and jailed for his ties to a jihadist recruitment ring in the northeast quadrant of @entity2			0
the ring , known by name for a park where they met , the @entity150 , was recruiting young disaffected @entity2 @entity155 to join in the @entity156 as jihadis against @entity64 forces			1
three of the young recruits wound up in @entity161 , where @entity64 forces died in numerous fierce battles			1
@entity163 was arrested in 2005 when he was about to leave for @entity164			0
he was sentenced to three years in prison in 2008			0
but @entity142 did n't serve any time after the conviction -- the judge ruled that his pretrial detention had been enough			0
still , his radicalization was well - known to officials , spelled out in detailed court documents back in 2007			0
the documents , obtained in conjunction with @entity174 , show @entity142 had a long history of jihadist aspirations , including going to @entity164 to " combat the @entity64 " for the " injustices " they had " inflicted on @entity164			1
" in 2010 , @entity142 was connected with a foiled plot to help a convicted terrorist escape from jail , though there was not enough evidence to send him back to jail			0
during his stint behind bars , @entity142 met @entity187 , a jihadi who was jailed for plotting to bomb the @entity190 in @entity2			0
@entity187 , a known @entity191 recruiter , was also connected to @entity192 , who died the same day as the two brothers after he killed several hostages at a kosher grocery store in eastern @entity2			0
at times before and after his stint in jail , @entity163 was under surveillance by @entity1 authorities			1
but several former top @entity1 government officials told @entity3 he had " dropped off " priority lists this past summer and was less carefully monitored			1
@entity142 's older brother , @entity202 , traveled to @entity203 in 2011 , according to a @entity64 official for three or more months and is believed to have trained with @entity191 while he was there			1
@entity192 was also known by @entity1 authorities			1
he , too , had a criminal past with jihadi links			0
like @entity142 , he was connected to the plot to free a convicted terrorist from jail			0
a @entity212 intelligence source told @entity3 that @entity192 was arrested in connection with the plot known as @entity215 in may of 2010			1
he was in possession of 240 rounds of ammo for a kalishnikov			0
while he was awaiting trial for the foiled plot , @entity142 visited @entity192 , according to the @entity212 intelligence source			0
despite all these well - known links to terror concerns , and even the links between @entity192 and @entity142 , all three attackers seem to have largely dropped from @entity1 surveillance priorities up to the moment they were linked to the ongoing attacks			1
" we know that the level of alert has been lowered in 2014 , " said @entity45			0
but he said the level of alert could and should have been raised			0
speaking just about the @entity143 brothers and @entity192 , @entity45 said : " actually , they could not be considered as a lower - level threat			0
those people were extremely dangerous , they were very motivated and the @entity1 have made a huge mistake by letting them off the radar or allowing them such a level of freedom in terms of operating , finance and preparing this attack , " he said			1
@entity88 , head of the @entity89 for the @entity245 , agreed			0
@entity192 had made several phone calls to target police in @entity1			1
@entity192 is believed to have killed a @entity1 policewoman on thursday			1
he was killed during the hostage attack on the kosher market on friday			0
while not known previously , it is now believed the @entity143 brothers ' jihadism extended beyond @entity164 , to @entity203 and @entity254			0
during their rampage , the @entity143 brothers had told witnesses they were " avenging the @entity258			0
" on the day of their final shootout and deaths , @entity1 station @entity259 says it spoke with both @entity163 and @entity192			1
the men both gave details of their jihadist @entity203 ties			0
they said , independently , that they were financed and supported by @entity267 , the @entity64 - born cleric who became the a key jihadi leader in @entity203 and was killed by @entity64 several years ago			1
the ties to @entity203 and @entity191 prompted many of the experts speaking to @entity3 to raise even more security concerns for the future			1
@entity143 is suspected of slipping off for terror training in @entity203 in july 2011 during a trip he made with another @entity1 national to @entity278 in july 2011 , according to multiple @entity1 officials who spoke to @entity174 national security reporter , @entity280			1
@entity280 shared the details of his reporting with @entity3			2
@entity64 intelligence agencies developed intelligence suggesting a high probability he slipped across to @entity203 during the trip to @entity278 , and informed their @entity1 counterparts , according to @entity280 's @entity1 sources			1
the @entity1 responded by placing @entity143 under surveillance in november 2011 by issuing a " @entity293 " notice , multiple @entity1 officials told @entity280			2
the surveillance was conducted by both @entity295 , @entity1 's domestic security service and later by the judicial police			2
wiretaps were authorized for his cell phones and that of his brother @entity142			0
but the surveillance of @entity202 was terminated in june 2014 because @entity1 security services judged him no longer dangerous , @entity280 was told			2
the surveillance of his brother @entity142 stopped earlier -- at the end of 2013			0
@entity142 's phone calls suggested he had disengaged with violent extremism and was focusing on counterfeiting clothing and shoes			0
" the fact that @entity315 's affiliate in @entity203 pulled off the most deadly terrorist attack in @entity317 in a decade speaks for itself , " said @entity3 national security analyst @entity311 , an expert on @entity191 and @entity312			1
" groups like @entity191 in @entity203 , as well as @entity320 and other jihadist groups in the @entity322 , are likely to continue to be a problem in @entity317 for the foreseeable future			0
" " hindsight is , of course , always 20/20			0
in the case of a large - scale terrorist attack , there is often intelligence in the system that was overlooked before the event , " said @entity311			0
" the @entity334 , for instance , knew that two men associated with @entity191 were living in the @entity64 who later turned out to be among the hijackers of the flight that crashed into the @entity339 on 9/11 ; the lead bomber in the @entity342 bombings of 2005 was known to @entity344 law enforcement , and the @entity346 shooter , @entity347 , had come to the attention of the @entity349 because of emails he exchanged before the attack with @entity352 , an @entity191 leader based in @entity203			2
" this time it 's the @entity1 that dropped the ball , but this is not a problem particular to @entity1			2

@entity358 will need to be increased or totally reviewed , expert and analysts tell @entity3
author : is the @entity64 is more able than @entity1 to monitor @entity1 jihadis on @entity1 territory ?
another expert says sheer numbers favor the jihadis at the moment
