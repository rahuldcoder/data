-- @entity2 's top security official has linked the deadly vehicle crash this week in @entity5 's @entity4 , which killed five people and is being described by @entity2 authorities as a terrorist attack , to an @entity10 separatist group			1
" the terrorist attack in @entity5 was organized and premeditated , " said @entity11 , the secretary of the @entity12 of the @entity13			0
" the instigator behind the scenes is the terrorist group the @entity17 that operates in central and west @entity18			1
" @entity11 was speaking thursday in @entity19 , the capital of the central @entity18 country @entity21			0
his brief comments were carried by the broadcaster @entity23 , which is based in @entity24			0
@entity2 officials have blamed the @entity17 in the past for fomenting unrest in @entity28 , the western @entity2 region that is home to the largely @entity30 ethnic group			1
the @entity4 crash -- which took place monday in the politically sensitive heart of the @entity2 capital underneath a giant portrait of @entity36 -- would be the most high - profile attack in recent years			1
no group has claimed responsibility for the crash so far			2
five suspects arrested the @entity42 listed the @entity17 as a terrorist organization in 2002 during a period of increased cooperation with @entity2 on security matters after the september 11 attacks			1
but details on the group 's activities and capacity are scarce			0
@entity2 authorities said this week that they worked with police in @entity28 to arrest five suspects in the @entity4 case			1
and they identified the three people inside the vehicle , which plowed through crowds of people before hitting the rail of a pedestrian bridge in front of the @entity65 and bursting into flames , as members of the same family with @entity30 - sounding names			0
the vehicle killed two tourists and injured 40 other people			1
authorities say its occupants died when they set light to gasoline inside the vehicle			0
as well as the gasoline , police say they found two knives , steel sticks and a flag " with extremist religious content " in the vehicle			0
questions over transparency the @entity84 , a diaspora group , has urged caution about the @entity2 government 's account of the @entity4 crash			1
" the @entity2 government will not hesitate to concoct a version of the incident in @entity5 , so as to further impose repressive measures on the uyghur people , " it said in a statement earlier this week , citing a lack of transparency over the investigation			1
state media inside @entity2 have given relatively limited coverage to the story			2
images posted immediately after the incident on @entity103 , @entity2 's version of @entity104 , which showed black smoke and a vehicle engulfed in flames , were largely deleted			2
searches combining the words " @entity110 , " " terrorism " and " car crash " were also blocked			0
@entity0 broadcasts about the subject were initially blacked out inside @entity2			2
simmering tensions tensions have run high in @entity28 between @entity116 and the millions of @entity118 people who have migrated to the large , resource - rich region over the past several decades			2
@entity116 complain of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces , despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony			0
activists say that a campaign is being waged to weaken the @entity116 ' religious and cultural traditions and that the education system undermines use of the @entity132			0
the simmering tensions have periodically boiled over into deadly violence , most notably in july 2009 , when rioting in @entity133 , the regional capital , killed around 200 people and wounded 1,700			1
that unrest was followed by a heavy crackdown by @entity2 security forces			1
@entity5 exaggerates the threat from @entity142 groups , @entity143 , an associate professor at the @entity144 for @entity145 at @entity146 , said this week			0
little of the violence that has occurred inside @entity28 should be considered terrorism , according to @entity143			0
" most of it looks like spontaneous civil unrest or isolated revenge violence carried out by individuals or small groups of local citizens , rather than by an organized militant group , " he said			2
however , @entity30 groups claimed responsibility for bus bombs in @entity161 and @entity162 prior to the @entity163 in 2008			0
the @entity2 government blamed an attempted hijacking of a flight in 2012 on @entity116 .			1
