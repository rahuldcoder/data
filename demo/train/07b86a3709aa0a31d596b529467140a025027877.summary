among @entity3 insiders , @entity0 , governor of @entity1 , is n't considered a leading presidential contender			1
@entity5 , @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 have all garnered more attention			0
the more interesting question has been -- until this week , at least -- why that is the case			0
@entity0 has the virtue of not only having won a gubernatorial race in one of @entity17 's most important swing states but of having remained relatively popular			1
a new @entity19 survey found that @entity0 had an approval rating of 53 % and a disapproval rating of 28 %			2
and though @entity1 bars its governors from seeking a consecutive second term , there is a better than even chance that @entity0 would defeat @entity26 , the presumptive @entity27 gubernatorial nominee , if he were allowed to run in 2013			2
the same ca n't be said of tea party stalwart @entity28 , the @entity3 attorney general who is running to succeed @entity0			1
moreover , @entity0 's 2009 campaign was in many respects an excellent template for a national @entity3 campaign , as it focused on job creation and energy development while largely avoiding ideological bromides			1
part of the reason @entity0 was able to run as jobs - centric pragmatist is that his socially conservative convictions were not in serious dispute			2
indeed , democrats in 2009 sought to highlight @entity0 's anti-abortion views , but to no avail			1
just one year after @entity45 had rallied moderate voters in @entity1 's affluent northern counties , @entity0 managed to win many of them back			1
he aggressively courted @entity49 - @entity17 and @entity50 voters , an effort that helped blunt the growing @entity27 advantage in these constituencies			0
one would think @entity3 would be beating down @entity0 's door			1
but recently , many conservative activists have soured on @entity0			0
for much of 2012 , the @entity1 governor has struggled to make progress on his policy agenda			0
progress in some areas , like k - 12 education , has been overshadowed by inaction in others , like the privatization of @entity1 's state - owned liquor stores or the all - important issue of alleviating traffic congestion			0
last week , however , @entity0 finally brokered a deal with the @entity70 to finance a sharp increase in new transportation spending with new taxes			2
this is despite the fact that @entity0 had pledged to resist any and all tax increases in his 2009 campaign			1
@entity0 has touted the potential benefits of the deal , emphasizing the economic costs of traffic congestion and the enormous gains that would flow from reducing it			0
but the tax increases have met with strong opposition from @entity28 , whom @entity0 has endorsed , and @entity84 , head of @entity85 and guardian of its @entity87			0
this reaction is hardly surprising			0
@entity1 's new transportation plan scraps the commonwealth 's $ 0.175 - per - gallon tax on gasoline , the value of which has eroded with inflation since it was first set at that rate in 1987 , and replaces it with a 3.5 % whole tax on motor fuel that will grow with the economy and the price level			0
it also raises @entity1 's retail sales tax on most items from 5 % to 5.3 % , with a further increase to 6 % in the most traffic - congested regions to pay for local transportation projects			0
all told , these new revenue measures will raise as much as $ 880 million per year , with an additional $ 200 million to be shifted to transportation from other spending priorities			0
not everyone is furious about @entity0 's measure that would increase taxes			1
some prominent voices , including @entity115 conservative commentator @entity114 and @entity115 columnist @entity116 , have praised the governor for addressing @entity1 's transportation woes			2
one wonders whether @entity0 might somehow be able to turn a liability -- having reneged on his tax pledge -- into a strength by presenting himself as a pragmatic , bipartisan problem - solver			2
it 's a long shot , given that primaries tend to be dominated by highly ideological voters			1
but it might be worth a shot all the same , particularly if the @entity3 presidential field proves thinner than expected in 2016 .			1

@entity130 : gov. @entity0 is n't a leading @entity3 presidential contender
@entity130 : @entity0 's 2009 campaign is a great template for a national @entity3 campaign
he says the governor , popular and pragmatic , pushed for an important transportation bill
@entity130 : it may be a long shot , but @entity0 should be included in @entity3 presidential field
