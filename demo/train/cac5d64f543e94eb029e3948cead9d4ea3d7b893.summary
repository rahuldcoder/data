-- trafficking of children and human organs is occurring in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated parts of @entity7 , killed more than 150,000 people , and left many children orphans , @entity7 prime minister @entity10 said wednesday			1
" there is organ trafficking for children and other persons also , because they need all types of organs , " @entity10 said in an exclusive interview with @entity0 's @entity12			1

" @entity7 is trying to locate displaced children and register them so they can either be reunited with other family members or put up for adoption , @entity10 said			1
but , he said , illegal child trafficking is " one of the biggest problems that we have			0
" many groups appear to be legitimate , " but a lot of organizations -- they come and they say there were children on the streets			2
they 're going to bring them to the [ @entity40 ] @entity39 , " he said			0
@entity10 said he 's trying to work with embassies in @entity42 to protect @entity7 's children from traffickers			1
" any child that is leaving the country has to be validated by the embassy under a list that they give me , with all the reports , " he said			2
speaking at his temporary headquarters in a police station near the @entity54 , @entity10 said the first thing @entity7 officials seek to confirm is whether the children have adoption papers before they leave the country			1
in @entity61 , the @entity60 said wednesday it is moving cautiously on the issue of adoptions from @entity7			1
" we want to be sure that when a child has been identified , that due diligence has been done to make sure that this is truly an orphan child and not a child that actually has family , " said @entity60 spokesman @entity64			2
" sometimes if you push too hard , too fast there can be unintended consequences			0
so we are being very , very careful			0
" " we respect the sovereignty of @entity7 and their right to control the departure of @entity7 children			1
so we think the system that has been established is working effectively			2
i know there is a perception out there of ' cut through the red tape			0
' but there are very good reasons we want to make sure this process works well , " @entity64 said			0
on the broader issue of @entity7 children , @entity10 told @entity12 the government will reopen schools monday in most of the country			1
he said there were particular problems in @entity42			0
" we can not open one school and not the other			0
but some of the schools want to operate right now			2
they say if there are tents -- if there are facilities and we can help them -- they are willing to open very rapidly			0
" @entity10 also highlighted the critical importance of getting enough tents and shelters to @entity7 before the rainy season begins in may			1
he said he did n't know where all the tents promised by aid agencies and governments are			0
" we have reports that they 've already sent 20,000 tents maybe , and 20,000 more are on the way			0
but yesterday , when we did n't see the tents and we did n't see any action to organize the shelters , the president himself asked to see the storage place and we only counted 3,500 tents			0
" @entity10 said president @entity122 asked for 200,000 tents to house between 400,000 and 500,000 people			1
" we are very preoccupied about the consequences of all those people on the street , if it starts to rain			2
" the prime minister also rejected criticism from within @entity7 and overseas that his government needs to be more visible to the @entity7 people			1
" we are in charge			0
frankly i do n't understand what that position is that we are not visible , " he said			2
" i almost feel that i spend more time talking to radio , television , than i am working			2
" " i know it 's part of my job and i have to communicate			0
but i really feel that i have spent too much time doing that			0
" @entity10 also said he does not believe it 's necessary to relocate the capital to another part of @entity7			1
" i have to wait for technical and scientific evaluation , but from what i 've heard until now , @entity42 will stay there			0
" " @entity148 is still there , @entity149 is still there			0
we just have to prepare a better constructed @entity42 , a safer @entity42 , " he said			0
he also acknowledged the need for more transparency and new procedures to prevent corruption in @entity7			1
but he said 70 to 80 percent of the aid coming to the country right now does not go through the @entity7 government			1
@entity10 said about 90 percent of @entity160 aid , for example , goes through non-governmental organizations			1
" they are accountable to the @entity160 government , but not to the @entity7 government , " he said			1
the prime minister told @entity12 that he does not believe people overseas are helping @entity7 out of a moral obligation			1
" i believe it 's a more pragmatic responsibility , " he said			0
" i believe @entity7 could be an interesting market in the midterm			2
we are 10 million [ people ] here and it 's a market			2
