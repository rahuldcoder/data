-- the @entity1 once again demonstrates how easily organizations , facing bad news that is not yet public , adopt a " circle the wagons " strategy to protect the institution , and convince themselves -- contrary to all evidence -- that the problem is not really very serious			1
it is an unavoidable fact that institutions act this way			1
it 's a rare organization that has the integrity or the confidence to deal openly with embarrassment or scandal			2
it is much easier for leaders -- and crowds of disillusioned students in the @entity22 case -- to flatly say the accusations are untrue			1
" i ca n't believe @entity26 would do such a thing , " they say			2
" the media has always wanted to bring down @entity22 football			2
" in the nearly 40 years i have been counseling organizations and their leaders about such incidents , their first reaction is almost always surprise and disbelief			1
these leaders often believe , naively , that everyone in their organization is ethical			1
faced with allegations of wrongdoing among their co-workers or employees , they adopt denial as an institutional and psychological defense			1
if evidence piles up that the charges are true , too many leaders , recognizing their own failure to create and sustain an ethical environment , conclude there was no way to prevent the events			1
" this was an aberration , " some leaders argue , " i am certain this person will never do anything like this again			1
" " he only did it because he had serious financial troubles at home " or " she was going through a divorce			2
" this can lead to the decision to ignore or sweep this case under the rug			0
other leaders conclude that although the misbehavior is true , the media frenzy or the government response will be so overblown that they have a twisted sort of obligation to hide it			1
" you ca n't stop the occasional bad apple , " one chief executive told me			0
" i would not be doing my organization any favors by revealing every one of these			0
the public would completely overreact			0
" once the initial decision is made that it 's best not to come clean , it becomes much harder to come clean later			0
the original charges are compounded by accusations of a cover - up			0
many leaders decide they have no alternative but to hunker down and hope the incident never comes to public attention			1
when it does , of course , the institution and all involved suffer much more damage than they would have by addressing the original charge			0
looking back , we ask how they could have had so little regard for the victims of the behavior -- be they children who were raped or the community whose water supply was poisoned			1
the sad reality is that leaders , swept up in denial and concern about embarrassing themselves and their organizations , do n't think first about the victims or the future victims -- they think about how to contain the damage			1
@entity22 is neither the first nor will it be the last organization to demonstrate this pattern			0
in just the past few months we have at least three other tragic examples of allegations of abuse left unreported by respected organizations : the esteemed @entity115 , and the @entity116 of @entity117 and @entity118 , @entity119			1
stories of businesses that stonewall are too numerous to count			0
the tobacco industry and its leaders have been pilloried for denying the harmful effects of cigarettes for decades			1
chemical companies -- including @entity127 , which was portrayed in the book and movie " @entity130 " -- denied and covered up the health effects of chemical spills			0
banks today , particularly @entity134 , are assailed for not admitting how badly they handled mortgage modifications			0
i wish we had more positive examples to cite , but even now we have to reach back 30 years for a role model : @entity141 's decision in the 1980s to tell the public everything it knew about the poisonings of @entity146 capsules , a case study we still hail and teach today			0
there are legal and other mechanisms that try to force better reporting : states with " mandated reporter " laws ; @entity155 and @entity156 laws for business gatekeepers ; even @entity158 , where offending companies get credit for having strong reporting or investigative policies			0
and we hope that in a few cases at least , enlightened leadership will create a culture where incidents are openly investigated			2
none of this eliminates the need for individuals in organizations to exercise the basic moral obligation to report abusive behavior			0
@entity174 and @entity175 at @entity22 have been accused of moral failure in the case of @entity178 because they allegedly failed to follow up sufficiently to prevent more children from being harmed			0
although it may satisfy a legal obligation to report a suspicion to a supervisor , the more fundamental moral duty is to prevent harm to others , even if an institution decides to withhold information			0
this can take great moral courage and a healthy dose of independent perspective			2
but we all have a stake in the moral integrity of our organizations , and a sacred duty to protect the vulnerable			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			1

@entity199 : institutions initially deny , hush up scandals to protect themselves
@entity199 : denial , *secrecy* is an institutional and psychological defense that *backfires*
@entity210 makes it seem victims come last , he says : think @entity212 , @entity115
@entity214 takes courage , he says , and enlightened leaders *foster* openness
