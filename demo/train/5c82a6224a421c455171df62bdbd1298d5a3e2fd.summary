@entity0 -- every morning at the crack of dawn , residents of a @entity0 slum gather by the railway tracks to do what most would only do in private -- go to the toilet			1
one by one , they arrive with water bottles in hand			0
some try to hide , while others are less coy			0
many seem unfazed by the trains that rumble past , blaring their horns , warning people to move off the tracks			0
this has been shop owner @entity18 's morning routine for the past 40 years			0
" i guess i do get embarrassed but what can i do ? " @entity18 asked with a shy grin			0
@entity22 's vast railways system , which carries some 11 million passengers a day , is often called the lifeline of @entity22			1
but one government official has dubbed it something else			0
" the @entity22 railway is really the world 's biggest open toilet , " said @entity28 , minister of rural development , at a recent bio-lavatory launch			1
" nearly 60 % of the people in the world who defecate in the open belong to @entity22 , we should be ashamed of this , " he said			1
@entity39 , 24 , was embarrassed to talk about it			0
in search of a better life , she left her village in southern @entity22 and moved to @entity0 a year ago			1
little did she know she 'd be struggling to find the most basic of facilities in the country 's capital			1
' not a single toilet here , " she said			1
" i really feel very ashamed , men and women ( go ) nearby , it 's really difficult conditions			0
" she said she only goes before sunrise at 4 a.m. and then after sunset at 7 or 8 p.m. both @entity18 and @entity39 live in a settlement colony with 3,000 people , just minutes away from @entity0 's @entity60 and a major five - star hotel			0
the neighborhood is typical of most @entity22 slums , small , one - room houses crammed with all the trimmings of modernity -- satellite television , refrigerators and air coolers -- but not a single household has a toilet			1
according to the @entity73 , open areas are the only toilet option for an estimated 625 million @entity22			1
a recent government census showed nearly half of @entity22 's households do not have a toilet , but more people own a mobile phone -- 53.2 % of @entity22 have a mobile phone compared to 46.9 % with lavatories			1
@entity39 could n't build a toilet even if she wanted to ; there are no sewage drainage lines at her area			2
" out of 7,935 towns in @entity22 , only 162 have sewage treatment plants , " said @entity88 , founder of @entity89 -- an ngo working to provide low - cost environmentally friendly toilets to @entity22 's poor for more than 40 years			1
now @entity88 has an innovative and simple solution that has helped transform the lives of millions of @entity22			1
it 's called the @entity98 , or @entity100 toilet , and it 's based on a two - pit system			2
both pits are attached to one latrine , but when one pit is being used , the other does the composting			0
no concrete is used and the soil naturally turns waste into fertilizer over time			0
it can be set up for as little as us $ 15 and it also only requires one liter of water to flush , while normal septic tank latrines require some seven to 10 liters of water			0
@entity89 has built some 1.2 million household toilets and 8,000 public toilets across @entity22			1
@entity88 says the @entity22 government has made 50 million toilets based on the two - pit design			1
he 's also taken the technology to 14 other countries in @entity123			0
in a village in the @entity127 district of @entity128 , just under 62 miles ( 100km ) from @entity0 , @entity124 has built a two - pit toilet in every household			2
" before we used to go to the jungles and we used to get bitten by mosquitoes and flies and get sick			0
since the toilets arrived , everything has changed , it 's much cleaner and a lot better , said @entity138 , a local resident			2
it 's something the villagers of @entity127 take pride in -- they keep their toilets clean and say they feel like they have finally progressed			2
" mobiles phones are very useful , but with a toilet i feel we have more dignity			2
i only have one mobile phone but i have two toilets now , " @entity138 said proudly .			2

@entity73 : open areas the only toilet option for millions in @entity22
most @entity22 slum housing lacks basic facilities such as toilets
@entity89 working to provide cheap , *sustainable* toilets for millions
