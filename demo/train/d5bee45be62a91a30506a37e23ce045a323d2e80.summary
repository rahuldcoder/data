-- there used to be a bookstore -- i think it was the @entity5 on 46th street -- where you 'd find a yellowing map of @entity9 's @entity8 : a listing of the locations the writer and director had made famous in such films as " @entity15 , " " @entity16 " and " @entity17			1
" that was the thing about @entity9 -- the map did n't have to venture far from the five boroughs			1
( or , frankly , from what another @entity9 -- @entity21 -- called " the @entity8 island			1
" ) starting sometime in the late ' 80s , @entity9 started expanding his geographical footprint considerably			1
well , at least to @entity25			1
his new film , " @entity27 , " is set in -- you guessed it -- @entity29			1
it opens in the @entity31 on june 22			1
it 's already opened in @entity33 , where it took in $ 3.7 million its opening weekend and was the country 's no. 1 grossing film , beating even the crowd - pleasing " @entity37			2
" @entity9 's latest follows a sequence of films set in @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
what does @entity9 see in these cultural capitals ? take a tour with the bespectacled filmmaker and the fine reference site www.movie-locations.com and find out			1
the @entity41 of " @entity49 " ( 2005 ) " @entity49 , " a hitchcockian crime drama that followed a series of middling comedies ( " @entity55 , " " @entity56 , " " @entity57 " ) was intended for @entity9 's native @entity8 but moved to @entity41 for the most practical of reasons : that 's where the financing was			1
nevertheless , @entity9 made the most of the trip , and it shows in the settings			1
the film , about social - climbing tennis player @entity65 ( @entity66 ) and his fraught affair with @entity31 actress @entity68 ( @entity69 ) , makes the city , at times , look as lush as @entity9 's @entity16 -- no small trick			1

among the works on display are @entity83 's " @entity82 , " @entity85 's " pharmacy " and @entity87 's " @entity86			2

perhaps the most famous of @entity41 's recent wave of @entity31 - style skyscrapers , architect @entity96 's tube - like high - rise is the site of @entity65 's post-tennis job			1

if you can afford it , @entity101 is @entity41 's luxury shopping and residential district , home to the custom tailors of @entity109 ( the street where the @entity111 once made their headquarters ) , the jewelers of @entity114 and what 's soon to be the former @entity31 embassy at @entity117			1
at the least , have a drink			0
that 's what @entity120 and @entity121 do			2
the @entity43 of " @entity123 " ( 2011 ) @entity9 's whimsical tale of an @entity31 writer ( @entity125 ) in the @entity43 is his most successful box office hit			1
it also won @entity9 his fourth @entity128			1
in the film , @entity125 's @entity129 , a troubled screenwriter trying to write a novel , longs for the @entity43 of the ' 20s , a period he sees as a golden era			2
he learns that nostalgia is in the mind of the beholder , but he certainly sees the city at its most dazzling			0

it 's here , near the steps of this 15th - century church , that @entity129 is strolling when the mysterious car pulls up and takes him back to the 1920s			2
also worth a look : the area around @entity162 in @entity163 ( 18ème ) , the highest point in @entity43 , full of beautiful vistas and steep stairways , where @entity129 finds himself late in the film			0
shop in : @entity169 ( 37 @entity168 , 5ème )			0
the original @entity169 , a bookstore that opened in 1919 , was a regular stop for @entity31 and @entity173 expatriates			1
the current shop dates from 1951 and was named after the first bookstore in 1964			0
the location on the @entity177 is close by the @entity178 , which connects the @entity177 with the @entity179 , home of @entity180			0
the @entity42 of " @entity181 " ( 2008 ) this romantic comedy , which starred @entity69 and @entity183 as two @entity31 students who get mixed up with a @entity186 artist ( @entity187 ) and his mentally unbalanced ex-wife ( @entity188 ) , won a @entity189 for best musical or comedy film			1
@entity192 won an @entity128 for best supporting actress			0

the century - old amusement park , located on a mountain overlooking the city , was where @entity199 , @entity200 and their boyfriends spent an afternoon			0
do n't want to go to an amusement park ? there 's always @entity206 , the turn - of - the - century hilltop development created by @entity208 , or @entity209 ( 401 @entity210 ) , @entity208 's amazing church , which has been under construction for more than 100 years			2

architect @entity217 's giant fish was commissioned for the @entity218			2
the @entity220 area was built up for the @entity221 and was the site of scenes featuring @entity199 and @entity200			0
the famed promenade may be less than a mile long , but it 's the place to be for people watching , window shopping and taking in some of @entity42 's most notable attractions , including the city 's opera house and the @entity232			2
@entity9 's protagonists certainly took advantage , shooting photographs and making assignations			1
the @entity29 of " @entity27 " ( 2012 ) ok , so the film is barely out , but based on the trailer and the cast , this looks like one of @entity9 's episodic turns -- there 's an older couple ( @entity9 and @entity245 ) , a set of confused young adults ( @entity248 , @entity249 , @entity250 ) and a couple of @entity25 adding color ( @entity253 , @entity188 )			1
the local press has criticized it for presenting a tourist 's view of the city , but moviegoers might not be so put off			2
visit : the @entity260 ( @entity261 , near the intersection of @entity263 and @entity264 )			0
@entity9 's characters would be remiss if they did n't drop a coin in the @entity261 , the ornate watering hole that was completed in 1762 , though its origins date back to the @entity269			1
the fountain has been featured in " @entity271 " and " @entity279 , " the latter of which pays tribute to the legend that a person who throws a coin in the fountain is destined to return to @entity29			2
photos : ireporters in @entity33 view : @entity29 was built on seven hills , so there 's plenty of spectacular views			2
one of the best is from the @entity287 of @entity288 in @entity289			0
you can take an elevator to the top , but climbing the 320 steps is well worth it			0
( be sure to dress properly , though : no shorts or miniskirts			0
) the @entity297 , where @entity192 's character cracks a lewd joke , is a short walk			0
shop in : @entity302 ( 1 @entity301 and surrounding area )			0
@entity9 may not be a fashion plate , but his upscale characters would certainly want to take advantage of the best @entity33 clothiers -- and it 's here , at the @entity309 , that many of them have their flagship stores			1
what if @entity25 is n't in your plans ? do n't worry			1
there 's always @entity16 , where the vast majority of @entity9 's 40 - plus films have been made			1
and if you want to really get off the map , take a trip to the @entity322			0
just remember : change your underwear every half - hour , and please wear it on the outside so authorities can check .			0
