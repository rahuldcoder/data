-- it was n't often @entity2 was caught out by a barrage of volleys on the court -- but the tennis great says he was stunned by the level of criticism he received after being appointed as @entity11 's coach			1
eyebrows were raised when @entity2 , a six - time grand slam winner , swapped his seat in the television commentary box to take up a role with the @entity18 star in december 2013			1
@entity2 , who won 64 @entity20 titles and three @entity21 crowns during a stellar 15 - year career , is one of the most popular faces in the sport			1
but he says the level of negative attention the move attracted from both inside and outside of the game was " all part of being @entity2			2
" " it was a little bit strange and i was a little bit surprised , " the @entity30 told @entity0 's @entity31 ahead of the @entity32 starting on monday			1
" i was n't aware i had that many doubters			0
i must have stepped on many toes in my life for all of them to beat the bushes and raise their opinion			0
" we live in a free world and everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but i was a little bit surprised			0
" @entity2 , who ended his playing days in 1999 , had never coached a top player on tour before joining forces with @entity11			1
" i like to think that i 'm very comfortable within the tennis community so i was surprised by some of the doubters , but this is sometimes a part of being @entity2 , " the 46 - year - old said			2
" you 're in the front row of life and in the headlines all the time , so a lot of people feel they 're entitled to their opinion , even though they do n't know anything about me			0
" @entity2 took on the challenge of restoring @entity11 to the top of the game , having lost his edge in the big matches			2
he had started 2013 in confident mood by winning a third consecutive @entity65 , but the rest of the year was disappointing , losing to @entity67 in the semis of the @entity69 and the final of the @entity32 either side of defeat in the @entity21 final against @entity74			1
@entity2 was introduced to the @entity11 camp ahead of the @entity76 but could only watch from the sidelines as his man relinquished his grip on the title at @entity81 , losing to eventual champion @entity82 9 - 7 in the fifth set of their quarterfinal clash			1
that setback brought about fresh criticism of @entity11 's relationship with @entity2 -- though the @entity30 says that defeat provided the springboard which culminated in the 27 - year - old winning his second @entity21 title in july and reclaiming the no. 1 ranking			1
a five - set victory over @entity95 gave @entity11 a seventh grand slam and went a long way to vindicating @entity2 's decision			1
" i think it made our relationship stronger , " said @entity2 of january 's @entity65 defeat , after which @entity11 reached the final at @entity69 but again lost to @entity67			1
" it made us realize that the only way out was up			0
the only way to quiet everybody down was to start winning again and that 's what he did			0
" if you coach a player like @entity11 , you expect perfection			2
" you expect the best			0
obviously , the locker room was full of skepticism and critics who do n't want this relationship to work , so we had to move up a gear			0
" fortunately , after his @entity21 triumph , the discussion was ended			2
" djokovic and world no. 3 @entity95 will be the top two seeds in @entity123 , with second - ranked @entity67 having withdrawn due to wrist problems			0
@entity11 has reached the final at @entity126 four years in a row , but his only victory was in 2011			0
@entity95 , meanwhile , will be seeking to extend his record of 17 grand slam titles -- but he has not triumphed in the @entity131 since the fifth of his consecutive wins in 2008			0
