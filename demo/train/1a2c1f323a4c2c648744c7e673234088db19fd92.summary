-- so the rumors were true			0
just a day after we reported on the implications of @entity5 's flexible display technology , we have images of the first fruits of its labors			1
announced in @entity11 today , @entity5 's @entity10 sports a 5.7 " 1080p flexible display that 's mounted on a gentle curve along its short side			1
the latitudinal curve is contrary to the expectations that the curve would be along the long axis , so as to better conform to the face during conversations			0
never one to skimp on the features , @entity5 is adding some new usage models , enabled by the curved design			1
dubbed " @entity30 , " one technique makes use of the curve as a way to provide glanceable information by simply rolling one edge down when the @entity28 is lying on its back			0
the time , notifications and other useful information fades into view and fades out when released			0
though not a member of the @entity37 family , the @entity28 does sport the note 3 's internal hardware , complete with a @entity41 800 processor , @entity42 of @entity43 , and a @entity45 camera			2
other interface tweaks are reportedly enabled by the design and revolve around rotating the device to either side			0
@entity5 is no stranger to motion control in its interfaces , but it 's been met with varying success			1
the aesthetics match the @entity37 , as well and it has the same plastic faux - leather back			0
the in - hand feel is reportedly improved by the arc of the phone			1
no word on a @entity61 release , though it will be available to our @entity11 readers through @entity64 tomorrow for around 1.09 million won ( about $ 1014 )			2
report : next @entity66 could have curved screen copyright 2011 @entity68			2

first result of @entity5 's new flexible screen technology is on the new @entity73 round
the phone has 5.7 - inch curved display screen
the round is only available in @entity11 , at least for now
