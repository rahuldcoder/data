-- manned space missions bring with them a plethora of challenges to keep astronauts alive and healthy , especially on long - duration space missions			1
astronauts need to breathe , eat , drink , excrete their food and drink , and be kept free of infections to stay healthy enough to do their job			1
the key to an astronauts ' wellbeing has been found , somewhat contradictorily , to be a group of tiny organisms -- bacteria			1
you might think of space as a germ - free environment , but microbes can be carried to space inside human gut flora as well as in food and water and once up there , can be expelled by humans in their breath			1
according to @entity28 , immune systems weaken during space flight , making the impact of infection even greater			2
what 's more , the weightless microgravity environment of space can alter bacteria as they grow			1
recent work by @entity37 and her team from @entity39 and her @entity28 collaborators discovered that certain bacteria become more virulent in space , meaning they become better at causing disease			1
" @entity45 bacteria become more potent , virulent and are more able to cause disease , " says @entity37			1
" they also become more resistant to factors such as the acid in your stomach			0
" @entity37 's group is investigating a range of bacteria found in food , water and our gut flora , including @entity45 typhimurium , a common cause of food poisoning and diarrhea , and @entity63 , which is a known water contaminant			1
' war with microorganisms ' as astronauts spend longer periods of time in space , their increased exposure to recycled air and water is likely to affect their risk of infection			2
@entity74 is one the people in charge of crew health at @entity28 and focuses on keeping microbes at bay			2
" we 're at a constant war with microorganisms because they adapt , " he says			0
" the stressful environment of spaceflight affects them and under stress your immune system also functions less effectively and we have to take precautions for this			0
" reduced immunity can cause some bacteria , such as @entity63 , to cause illness despite normally being carried by many of us with no effect			0
" however , not all microorganisms are bad and so the key is to understand how they change and impact us , " explains @entity74 , who also found that the infectious bacteria @entity99 , which causes a range of symptoms from boils to food poisoning , may not increase in virulence like @entity45 in microgravity			1
by understanding the changes in @entity45 and other disease - causing bacteria in microgravity , @entity37 hopes to not only keep crew healthy but also help humans down on @entity115 through the development of drugs and vaccines			1
" infections are becoming harder to treat ; we have no vaccine for @entity45 food poisoning and it remains [ one of ] the leading cause of bacterial food - borne illness worldwide , " states @entity37			1
spaceflight opens up a new world of research that ca n't take place on @entity115 and @entity37 has unmasked key changes in the behavior of genes in the bacteria which are n't usually seen under gravity			2
" vaccines are about identifying targets and in microgravity the bacteria have unmasked themselves and revealed secrets to help develop therapeutics			1
" sustaining life in space the research is in its early stages but it 's just one example of how bacteria are being investigated by space agencies			2
far from just a health hazard , bacteria could be used to help sustain astronauts in space , as a source of food and oxygen			1
" the major advantage to using bacteria is the size of them , " explains @entity154 , coordinator of life support research and development at the @entity156 ( @entity156 )			0
" for space missions the mass of oxygen , food , and water is high and not compatible with current launch technologies			1
a crew of six to @entity168 would need over 30 tons			0
" @entity154 directs the @entity170 programme at @entity156 , which aims to develop a regenerative life - support ecosystem for use on board spacecraft			1
" we need to recycle everything for an ecosystem that can sustain human life , " says @entity154			0
the team wants to recycle 80 % of all mass on board , including carbon dioxide , which can become toxic if allowed to build up			0
key algae and bacteria can mop up carbon dioxide and in turn release oxygen to enable astronauts to breathe			1
" we have approached this molecule by molecule , first oxygen , then water and now food , which is more complex , " says @entity154			2
the chosen range of bacteria not only utilize carbon dioxide but can also harness other human waste products , such as urine and feces -- a win - win given their growth results in food for the astronauts			2
eating bacteria grown on urine may not sound like a delicacy , and it is n't , which is why psychology also comes into play			0
" our most advanced work is using spirulina as this has been used as a protein source for many centuries and in many countries , making it much more psychologically acceptable , " explains @entity154			0
@entity212 is a cyanobacterium found in many salt water lakes and is consumed readily by lake communities			0
the edible bacterium is also marketed as a health supplement			0
in the search for bacteria that feed on our food waste , @entity154 's team discovered a hidden gem that has an additional medical benefit -- helping to fight cholesterol			2
" we were looking for bacteria which use a lot of carbon and nitrogen as there 's a lot of this in waste disposal , " states @entity154			0
the resulting use of @entity236 led to a nutritious product found to produce significantly lower levels of cholesterol in mice and will soon be marketed by spin - off company @entity241 , which is in talks with big pharma			0
this bacterium has been by - passed in favor of more nutritious alternatives for consumption by astronauts but the research to get there has borne beneficial fruit for those of us not venturing up into space			0
as for the astronauts , @entity168 missions could be a reality in the , albeit distant , future			0
and when the day comes , crews could depart feeling confident of reaching the red planet well fed , watered and free of infection .			0

a key challenge of manned space missions is keeping crews healthy
bacteria such as @entity45 become more virulent infections in space
the properties of bacteria in space can be harnessed to develop vaccines against them
bacteria could provide food , drink and oxygen on board spacecraft
