@entity10 's death was first reported by her daughter , @entity11 , on @entity12			2

she could change calm waters into a raging storm with a look and the lift of a finger , " @entity11 told @entity0 in an email			2
" my heart is a hole without her , but that hole will definitely be filled with incredible memories , sweet , salty and funny			2
i want her memory to linger with those who knew her and be given to those who did not			0
" @entity10 , who was born in @entity36 , @entity37 , in 1910 , was a well - known @entity39 actress when she was brought to @entity41 by @entity42 in 1935 in the belief she could be the next @entity44			1
she immediately came through on their investment with her star turn in 1936 's " @entity4 , " winning a best actress @entity2			1
she repeated the achievement with 1937 's " @entity5 , " based on @entity51 's novel , in which she played @entity52 , the wife of protagonist @entity54			0
with that prize , she became the first actress to win consecutive best actress @entity2 -- a feat not equaled until @entity59 pulled off the trick for 1967 's " @entity61 " and 1968 's " @entity62			1
" to date , they are the only actresses to have done so			0
both @entity64 and @entity65 have done so in the best actor category , and @entity67 won two straight supporting actor @entity2			1
but unlike @entity59 , who enjoyed a long career in movies despite the vagaries of fame , @entity10 's life as a @entity6 star was short - lived -- by her own choice			1
she had frequent battles with @entity42 boss @entity77 and did n't like the roles she was offered			1
" all kinds of nonsense , " she told the @entity81 's @entity80 news site in 2009			0
" i did n't want to do it , and i walked out			0
@entity77 said , ' that girl is a @entity86 , she 's going to ruin our whole firm			0
' he said , ' we made you and we are going to destroy you			1
' " instead , @entity10 turned the tables and left @entity42			1
her marriage , to playwright @entity91 , had fallen apart ( partly over his envy of her friendship with @entity96 , who " liked my vivaciousness , " she said ) and she returned to @entity39			1
she married @entity99 , a publisher , in 1945			0
the two were married for more than 40 years , until his death in 1989			0
she made a film for @entity103 , " hostages , " in 1943 , but that was it until 1997 , when she appeared in a @entity81 production of @entity108 's " @entity107			1
" she had other opportunities -- @entity111 asked her to appear in 1960 's " @entity112 , " but she had a falling - out with the @entity115 director before filming -- though she did n't lament leaving movies			2
her life was quite full , with famous friends -- @entity119 and @entity120 among them -- and plenty of activity , including a few plays and tv roles			1
she was n't easily impressed , by @entity6 or fame			0
asked about the @entity129 - winning @entity128 author @entity127 , who stayed with her and @entity130 in @entity131 once , she told the @entity80 that he was " terrible			2
" '' you could not talk to him about anything except his own work , you know ? he was so conceited , and demanding ! " she said			0
despite her long life , she told the @entity80 that she felt that there was so much more she wished to know			1
nothing ! " she said			0
" my @entity145 , one 's lifespan is so very short			0
" at the time , she was just shy of 100			0
@entity10 is survived by her daughter , two granddaughters and two great - grandchildren			2
people we 've lost in 2014			0

@entity1 was first actress to win back - to - back @entity2
