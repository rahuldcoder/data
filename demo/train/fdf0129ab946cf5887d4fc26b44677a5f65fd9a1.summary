@entity0 -- the problem - plagued @entity2 took part in its first combat mission monday night , hitting @entity6 targets in @entity7			1
the price tag for those jets , which were in development for decades , is a staggering $ 412 million each -- triple its expected cost , according to the @entity12 ( @entity12 )			1
originally designed and built to replace other fighter and ground attack aircraft in the @entity18 military 's arsenal , the radar - evading @entity2 is an evolutionary dead end			2

@entity28 : @entity7 strikes show ' this is not @entity18 's fight alone ' the @entity19 is confident it solved the problem , but some top pilots still refused to fly the plane , citing safety concerns			0
today , the @entity19 has 187 of the fighters after one crashed in 2010 , killing the pilot			0
