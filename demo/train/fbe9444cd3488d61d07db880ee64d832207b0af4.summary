@entity0 -- @entity3 's mother says she 's hoping dr. @entity4 will get the harshest sentence possible , four years in a state prison , in the death of her son			1
" i do n't believe that he intended for @entity3 to die , " @entity9 told @entity1 monday			2
" he was just taking a chance			0
" a jury found @entity4 guilty of involuntary manslaughter three weeks ago , and @entity15 judge @entity14 set tuesday for his sentencing			1
pastor , who sent @entity4 directly to jail after he was convicted this month , has a choice ranging between probation and up to four years in a state prison			1
but measures to relieve @entity24 prison and jail crowding could significantly shorten his time locked up			0
prosecutors successfully argued that @entity4 's reckless use of the surgical anesthetic propofol to help @entity3 sleep , without proper monitoring equipment , led to the pop icon 's death			1
testimony during his trial revealed that @entity4 gave propofol nearly every night in the two months before the singer 's death on june 25 , 2009 , as @entity3 prepared for his comeback concerts set for @entity40 the next month			1
@entity9 and several of her children will be in court for the sentencing tuesday , but her grandchildren @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 will not			1
they 'll be at school , she said			0
she was uncertain whether anyone from the family would speak in court , but she was interviewed by a probation officer who will include her thoughts in the report to the judge , @entity3 said			1
@entity4 's elderly mother , @entity57 , wrote a letter to the judge asking for mercy , saying " his compassion and his soft heartedness for others led to this dilemma			1
" prosecutors are asking for the maximum four years behind bars , and they want @entity4 to pay @entity3 's children more than $ 100 million in restitution			1
defense lawyers want probation , not prison time			2
each side will have a chance to present oral arguments tuesday , but their positions were detailed in sentencing memos filed with the judge last week			2
@entity4 has " displayed a complete lack of remorse " about @entity3 's death , and is , " even worse , failing to accept even the slightest level of responsibility , " deputy district attorneys @entity78 and @entity80 wrote			1
the prosecutors cited @entity4 's decision not to testify in his own defense , even while he was giving interviews for a documentary that aired days after the verdict			1
" in each of these interviews , the defendant has very clearly stated that he bears no responsibility for @entity3 's death , " the prosecutors said			0
" moreover , the defendant has continued to express concern only for his individual plight and portrays himself , not the decedent , as the victim			0
" " i do n't feel guilty because i did not do anything wrong , " @entity4 said in the documentary quoted by the prosecution			2
" finally , the defendant consistently blames the victim for his own death , even going so far as to characterize himself as being ' entrapped ' by the victim and as someone who suffered a ' betrayal ' at the hands of the victim , " the prosecutors said			0
@entity3 's death came as he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts in @entity40 , which the defense argued pressured the singer to seek sleep or risk having the concerts canceled			0
the prosecutors contend in their sentencing memo that @entity4 should be ordered to pay @entity3 's three children restitution for the subsequent " wage and profits lost , " as provided under @entity24 's " victim 's bill of rights " law			2
the singer 's " estate estimates @entity3 's projected earnings for the 50 - show @entity133 concert series to be $ 100,000,000 , " the prosecutors said			0
with nearly $ 2 million in funeral expenses and 10 % interest added each year , the prosecution is asking pastor to order @entity4 to pay @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity138 more than $ 120 million in restitution			2
while it is doubtful that @entity4 , who is unlikely to ever practice medicine again , could pay much of that sum , it could prevent him from reaping financial benefits from any books , interviews or film projects in the future			2
defense lawyers , in their sentencing memo , said @entity4 is suffering " manifold collateral consequences " because of the felony conviction			2
the memo included a biography of @entity4 that described him as " a self - made man of humble origins , " who paid his own way through medical school without scholarships or family funds			0
" he was raised in a home that lacked indoor plumbing or electricity , and he walked to school barefoot for his first couple years of school , " the defense said			0
he worked as a doctor for 20 years , with " no prior contacts with the law , " and many of his patients were elderly in low - income , underserved communities , the defense said			0
" it seems reasonable that the transgression for which he is to be judged should be viewed within the context of the larger life of which it is a part , " it said			0
the defense challenges the prosecution 's contention that @entity4 is not remorseful			2
" dr. @entity4 wishes to make it unmistakenly clear to everyone that he deeply mourns the loss of @entity3 's life , and he profoundly regrets any mistakes or oversights on his part that may have contributed to it , " the defense said			1
the judge should also consider " the manifold collateral consequences that dr. @entity4 has sustained as a result of his mistake , " the defense said , including the loss of his medical career , the public disgrace and loss of privacy			1
" dr. @entity4 has been described as a changed , grief - stricken man , who walks around under a pall of sadness since the loss of his patient , mr. @entity3 , " the defense said			1
the defense memo included a letter from @entity4 's elderly mother , @entity57			1
she sat in court for much of her son 's trial , just a few feet away from @entity3 's mother			1
" i sympathize with mrs. @entity9 as a mother , " @entity211 wrote in a letter to the judge			1
" i sense she was very close to her son			0
i really wanted to approach her personally and tell her i am sorry for the loss of her son , but i was unsure if she would be receptive , and i did not want to take the chance of violating court rules			0
i am sorry for all her loss			0
" while @entity4 's mother told the judge her son is " saddened and remorseful " about @entity3 's death , she said " his compassion and his soft heartedness for others led to this dilemma			1
" the defense contends that @entity4 was trying to help @entity3 , who was desperate for sleep so he could be ready for rehearsals			0
" his compassionate intentions should not be overlooked , " it said			0
" the victim was a willing recipient of the medications administered , " the defense said			0
" in fact , mr. @entity3 had repeatedly begged dr. @entity4 for propofol to overcome his insomnia so that he could sleep			1
" @entity4 does not pose a safety threat to the public , it said			0
" the likelihood of recurrence is essentially nonexistent since @entity4 's medical license has been suspended			1
" aside from the arguments of what @entity4 deserves , the defense contends that @entity24 's prison and jail crowding mean that " neither the space nor the public funds exist to continue imprisoning nonviolent , nondangerous offenders who do not need to be incapacitated for the sake of public safety			1
" " dr. @entity4 is clearly such a defendant , " the defense said			1
" he is an individual who remained free on bond for more than two years prior to the jury verdict , adhering assiduously to all of the bond conditions that had been imposed			0
" if @entity4 takes up a state prison or county jail cell , it " may mean that someone else with higher potential for violence will be released , " the defense said			2
instead , the defense proposed that @entity4 could be sentenced to community service along with probation			2
" though he will perhaps not again be a doctor qualified to make diagnoses , he could educate and counsel patients about heart care and disease prevention , " it said			0
" there are many nonprofit clinics and organizations that would benefit from his participation , if ordered to perform community service as a condition of his sentence and a means of ' putting some water back into the public well			0

@entity9 's thoughts on dr. @entity4 are in a report prepared for the judge
@entity4 's " compassion and his soft heartedness " led to his troubles , the doctor 's mother says
@entity4 could get anything from probation to four years in prison tuesday
