@entity0 -- it may be the most overlooked mega-bill of the past 12 months			0
the nearly $ 1 trillion farm bill received final approval on tuesday from the @entity6 , which sent the compromise already passed by the @entity8 to president @entity9 to be signed into law			1
while it 's called the farm bill , in truth , it 's more of a food bill			1
it sets five years of eating and farming policy in the @entity17 , including what we grow , what you know about your dinner and how much government spends in the process			1
it cuts the food stamp program and increases spending on farmers markets			1
whatever you think of @entity32 , this is a bill that deserves some attention			2
@entity35 : food stamp cuts to hit profits here 's five lesser - known things the farm bill could mean to you : 1			1
you will know a lot more about your meat : how much do you know about the chicken breast you just bought ? or that ribeye ? this farm bill marks a major decision in the fierce fight over product labeling , by backing a new requirement that pork , chicken or beef sold in the @entity17 must include details on where the animal was born , slaughtered and processed			1
take a look at a package of meat in the store tonight and you 'll see it			0
that information has been on labels since the fall			0
but @entity64 and @entity65 meat producers have fought the new @entity17 labeling rule in world courts and furiously tried to have it reversed by the farm bill			1
in the final days of negotiations , lawmakers decided to keep the meat labeling rule			0
so if your meat is from the @entity17 or if it was ever handled in @entity65 , @entity64 or @entity75 , you 'll know			1
farmers will see less risk ; federal government takes on more : the bill dramatically changes 82 years of agricultural subsidies , ending guaranteed payments that farmers receive regardless of their harvest quality or crop prices			1
but , because those " direct payments " have been in place for generations , many farm values became based on the expectation of government dollars			2
ending them could have wide - ranging effects			0
to try and mitigate the hit , the farm bill beefs up a different kind of subsidy -- a subsidy for crop insurance			1
this is complex , but in short , the government will make crop insurance cheaper and it will pay out some benefits at lower levels than previously			0
that will make farming less risky for some			2
but it transfers that risk to the federal government , which could be even more on tap if crop prices plummet or if a disaster hits			0
good for farmers , risky for the deficit			0
lawmakers are n't disclosing something : just like any farmer , members of @entity32 who own farmland can receive the crop insurance subsidies we talked about above			0
this can significantly cut premiums and save a bundle of money			0
the @entity125 @entity8 initially thought it was a good idea to know who in @entity32 would benefit from those subsidies and the original version of the bill included a requirement that lawmakers disclose if they or anyone in their immediate family receive the government help			1
but the @entity6 did not include the provision and in the end the @entity8 and @entity6 agreed to drop it			2
lawmakers could have opted for a higher standard of transparency either for themselves or for everyone receiving these subsidies , but instead the public will have no way of discovering where this money flows			0
@entity147 trims $ 90 a month from food stamps 4			2
we have land problems : the race to scoop up recent farming profits , especially in corn , has led to increased plowing of virgin lands in the @entity17			1
at the same time , rural areas face more soil erosion and other issues from land that has been worked for generations			0
the farm bill does something new on both issues			1
it forces farmers who want subsidies to follow a series of conservation practices			2
and it aims to protect more prairie land by cutting subsidies in half for people who farm on some virgin sod			2
environmentalists have applauded the provisions , but are n't doing back flips			0
they note that the bill cuts direct spending on government conservation programs overall			1
what goes in your body -- corn and sushi : the farm bill decides which crops the @entity17 government wants to encourage or protect			1
it gives incentives to grow more of them			0
the most subsidized crops in this ( and in most farm bills of the past ) are the so - called " row crops , " things like wheat , soy , and the king of @entity17 agriculture , corn			1
these subsidies are one reason corn will remain one of the country 's most reliable sources of food , from cattle feed to soda sweetener			1
the green and yellow vegetable will be a major part of your life for the foreseeable future			0
at the same time , this bill adds a few new winners to the list of subsidized row crops , among them sushi rice			0
if sushi rice prices fall too low , the government will now make up the difference			0
the possible result of that ? more farmers will consider planting the crop			0
and there will likely be more @entity17 sushi rice to go around .			2

new : the @entity6 passes the nearly $ 1 trillion farm bill on tuesday
it sets five years of eating and farming policy in the @entity17
it cuts the food stamp program and increases spending on farmers markets
continued subsidies ensure corn remains one of the country 's most reliable sources of food
