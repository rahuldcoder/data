" i would say that my work is sinister , but it 's also imbued with a dark humor , " said the 32 - year - old , originally from " the wilds of northern @entity15			0
" " at the racetrack there is a certain energy in the air , it is very magical , even if there is a seedy and dark side to it as well			1
" @entity27 's unnerving images could be scenes from a 1960s murder mystery , rather than a sports arena usually filled with stampeding horses and screaming punters			1
just who is this glamorous young woman , pictured on an eerily empty race course ? in fact it is @entity27 herself , who donned thrift store costumes for the surreal photo shoot at stadiums across @entity42			1
the cinematic series -- called " @entity44 " or " they already think i 'm @entity47 " -- was named the winner of a competition exploring gambling , and exhibited at @entity52 photography center in the @entity54 capital			1
" during the shoot , people saw what appeared to be a mad woman in a wig throwing her legs up in the air and generally enacting acrobatic poses for the camera , " she said			1
" but i found that it added a certain ambiguity and uncanniness to the scene when i was partially hidden or when my face was unseen			1
" romance of the racetrack growing up in rural @entity12 , @entity27 discovered the joys of the racetrack later in life , describing being " raised by a family of lumberjacks and spending my youth trapping and taming wolves			1

from @entity102 's 19th century paintings depicting jockeys in luminous color , to @entity105 in the 1964 musical " @entity106 " and recent @entity109 series " luck " starring @entity110 , what makes the racetrack such a ripe backdrop for artists ? " it 's got that mystique of people knowing more than you do , " said @entity114 of @entity115 , a company which promotes @entity117 horseracing around the world			1
" it 's a sport of intrigue			0
it 's one man betting his judgment against another			0
one horse trainer or one jockey trying to win against a load of other guys			2
" spooky stadium ? and it 's a different intrigue altogether once the stadium is empty			2
" i 've been to racecourses before which are quite empty and they 're sad places in comparison to the joy , pleasure , and buzz you get when there 's racing , " said @entity114			0
" it 's slightly spooky			2
