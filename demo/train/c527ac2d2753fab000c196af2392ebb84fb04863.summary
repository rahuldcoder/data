@entity0 , @entity1 -- the stakes in the current budget battles are enormous			1
as the super-committee deliberates over how to reduce the deficit and other congressional committees struggle to cut spending , the fate of important programs hangs in the balance			1
while the @entity13 public tends to focus on the highest profile issues such as @entity15 and defense , some of the smaller , off - radar issues are also vital and ca n't be ignored			1
the combination of rising deficits , hyper - partisanship , and tea party conservatism has put numerous policies at risk			2
one of the programs that could suffer is the president 's @entity26 , otherwise known as @entity26			1
it is one of the less well known creations of president @entity31			1
started in 2003 , the program began by providing $ 15 billion over five years to combat @entity33 around the globe through testing , counseling and medical treatment			1
the amount initially spent was over three times what the nation had spent on this cause before			0
president @entity31 , who believed the idea was like the @entity45 , a @entity13 program in 1948 that provided economic assistance to @entity49 to help in reconstructing the continent after @entity51 and prevent the spread of communism , said : " when we see a plague leaving graves and orphans across a continent , we must act			1
when we see the wounded on the road to @entity61 , we will not -- @entity13 will not -- pass to the other side of the road			0
" some , including democrats who do n't care for the rest of his record , believe that it is his greatest accomplishment			0
though the @entity13 foreign aid program , where @entity26 is housed , constitutes less than 1 % of the federal budget , it has helped to save the lives of millions of people and helped to contain a disease that was ravaging the @entity77 continent			1
by 2009 , a study in the @entity79 reported that in @entity77 countries receiving @entity26 funding there had been a 10.5 % reduction in the @entity33 death rate			1
the program has been extended under president @entity86			2
to be sure , it has not been without controversy			0
some liberals complained the program pushed for ineffective abstinence measures , to please the religious right , while some conservatives viewed it as a an unneeded expenditure			2
but in general , it has been considered an example of policy success in an era when @entity13 love to criticize government			2
what happens next is uncertain			0
with @entity63 and @entity103 focusing on massive foreign aid cuts as part of a deficit deal , with some estimates upward of $ 60 billion , the @entity102 would be unlikely to continue with humanitarian programs such as these for very long			2
proposals to cut this humanitarian spending , noted @entity112 , the president of the @entity113 , are " very , very concerning and comes at exactly the wrong time			0
" @entity112 added that the program has been a " game changer			2
" in august , the @entity13 government announced that anti-retroviral @entity33 medicines could reduce the transmission of the disease from infected to non-infected partners by 96 %			1
moreover , the @entity123 program on @entity33 announced a plan to eliminate pediatric @entity33 infections by 2015			1
the plan explains that , " it is possible to stop new hiv infections among children and keep their mothers alive if pregnant women living with @entity132 and their children have timely access to quality life - saving anti-retroviral drugs			2
" the moral weight behind the program becomes clearer in a riveting new documentary by first - time filmmaker @entity140 , whose movie , " @entity142 , " premiered at the @entity143			1
the movie follows the struggles of a @entity147 woman named @entity148 who has become pregnant			0
@entity148 , who was trapped in a polygamous marriage , learns that she has @entity33			1
the film follows her effort to protect her child from acquiring the disease as well			0
one of the most striking aspects of the film is the network of health care workers who come into her life , providing counsel and medicine , seeking to prevent the transfer of the disease to the children			0
now , @entity165 will have to make a decision about whether to increase funds for @entity26 , whether to reduce its funds or even keep the program alive			2
although this program is one of the longest lasting creations of president @entity31 , many younger republicans are not supportive of it			1
@entity176 , moved to the right by the tea party , have little appetite for spending on anything that does not seem to be absolutely essential to the nation			0
in 2008 , when she voted against the re-authorization of @entity26 , @entity182 said , " the @entity13 is the most generous nation on earth			0
we have to have a balancing act between our benevolence and our prosperity			0
and our prosperity today is at risk			0
we will not survive if our benevolence allows the treasury to not only be empty -- but to have us be a debtor nation greater than we have ever been before			0
" but before @entity165 takes action , @entity13 would do well to consider the kinds of transformative impact that government can have			0
when a program does work , as the evidence suggests that @entity26 has , and is desperately needed , there should be some kind of security for its future			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			1

@entity206 : @entity209 's budget - cutting *endangers* some worthy programs
he says a @entity31 administration program that provides billions to fight @entity33 is in jeopardy
@entity206 : the program saves lives and is an example of government that works
