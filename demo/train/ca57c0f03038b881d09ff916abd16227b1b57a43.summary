-- @entity1 was nowhere in the tavern , either in person or on record			0
but inside my head i was hearing his voice : " drop the coin right into the slot / you 've got ta hear something that 's really hot			0
... " @entity12 was n't in the place , either			0
not the man , not his music			0
yet i was hearing his voice , too : " hey , mister , that 's me up on the jukebox / i 'm the one that 's singing this sad song / well , i 'll cry every time that you slip in one more dime ... " there was no mystery to what was bringing on this private reverie			1
i had stopped into an @entity28 tavern for a cheeseburger the other night , and when i looked across the room i saw an ultra-slim , touchscreen - enabled , digital - music - only jukebox displaying a backlit message			1
the message was an invitation to try something called @entity37			0
to do that , customers would download an app to their smartphones			0
this would allow them -- in the words of the official announcement from @entity45 -- to " play music right from your seat			1
there 's no more waiting in line to select songs			0
" digital jukeboxes have , of course , been around for quite a while			2
the more recent app - enabled jukeboxes -- there is competition in the field ; @entity45 is not alone -- are based upon a perceived desire : that customers in bars and restaurants are eager to pull out their smartphones , gaze at the little screens , see a full selection of the songs on the jukebox that 's across the room , then , in @entity45 's words , take advantage of " a greatly improved user interface and a variety of new features , including automatic check - ins , better search capabilities , and a more secure purchasing process			1
" in other words : play a song			0
now ... ingenuity on the part of companies is to be applauded , and it 's certainly easy to see how the jukebox industry feels the need to keep modernizing			2
every person with a smartphone already has , in essence , a personal jukebox in his or her pocket -- what 's the need for real jukeboxes if everyone has an infinite and portable selection of music available at all times ? so , on the surface , it makes sense that jukebox manufacturers would try to do all they could do to appeal to the smartphone generation			1
however , something feels slightly amiss			0
for starters , is it really such a burden to stand up and walk the few feet to a jukebox ? it 's a hallowed part of the @entity110 experience -- that jukebox stroll , and then standing there thinking about what to play next , has always been kind of a kick			1
and besides , people can use the exercise			2
also : is there truly a hankering among people to find yet another reason to stare at their phones instead of at their actual surroundings ? it 's not as if music summoned from phone screens is a rarity , some exotic trick destined to fascinate			2
people do it all day , every day			2
jukeboxes , though ... well , jukeboxes were never meant to be regarded from a distance			2
they glowed and bubbled , they flashed and blinked , their come - hither wink said : you really want to walk over here			1
you wo n't be sorry			0
what could be simpler : @entity142 over to the jukebox , commune with its list of songs , feed it some money , listen to the music you 've chosen			2
well , perhaps this is simpler , although it 's difficult to imagine			0
according to @entity45 , " using the app is easy : just search for a venue with the app 's built - in location finder , sign in with a @entity153 account , and start playing your favorite songs ! if you do n't have a @entity153 account , you can create one from within the app. ... once a user selects a song , funds are pulled from the user 's @entity162 and sent directly to the machine			1
" ( and , for those who are accustomed to vip lounges and skyboxes , users of the app can , from many feet away , ditch in line , according to @entity45 : " they can even bump their songs to the front of the queue by selecting the @entity176 option for an additional charge			0
" ) lovers of jukeboxes have long known , through word of mouth , where the best ones in every city are			2
there was an exceptional one in the first - floor bar of a long - gone @entity186 in @entity187 , where @entity191 's " @entity190 , " when it first came out , sounded almost as good as hearing the band play the song live ; a jukebox in a bowling alley called @entity195 's @entity194 in @entity196 , @entity197 , had an especially crisp - sounding version of @entity200 's twang - and - power - chord remake of " @entity201			1
" you may have your own nominees ; a good jukebox is worth traveling many miles to visit			1
it 's certainly worth getting up from your seat			1
at @entity209 , a restaurant and bar in @entity212 that has for decades been reputed to have one of the finest jukebox selections in the @entity110 , @entity1 himself is still a regular , in - the - flesh presence			1
in the early @entity218 movie " loving you , " a jukebox even plays a key role as @entity218 ' ally in a fight with a local tough guy			2
here : take a look for yourself			0
there is , at least symbolically , a throwback aspect to the app plan : @entity110 who are old enough may remember the little wall - box jukeboxes that were mounted next to booths in some restaurants , for the convenience of customers in mid-meal			1
so perhaps it will turn out to be a brilliant business decision to adapt jukeboxes to the smartphone era			1
but there 's another school of business thought : when everyone else zigs , that 's the time for you to zag			0
let people , at their homes , in their cars , at their offices play personal music on their phones to their hearts ' content			0
they 're doing it anyway			0
but when they go out at night , give them something they do n't have at home : an old @entity254 , or @entity255 , or @entity256			0
a classic jukebox stocked with vinyl , with records the customers can actually watch being played behind the glass			1
on astonishing - looking turntables			0
now , that would be something worth getting out of your seat to see			1
but , a word of caution , from @entity270 : " please , mister , please / do n't play @entity271 ... " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity274 .			1

new smartphone apps let people control jukeboxes from their seats
@entity274 says the classic jukebox experience includes the stroll to the machine
@entity274 : jukeboxes glowed and bubbled , flashed and blinked , gave a come - hither wink
a good jukebox is certainly worth getting up from your seat , he says
