for a company that has n't attended @entity2 since 1992 , @entity0 dominates the show			1
you ca n't walk more than a dozen feet here at the @entity6 without seeing an @entity7 or @entity8 of some kind			0
@entity0 's overwhelming presence by proxy is impressive , and underscores the immense place the company occupies in the consumer electronics sector			1
of the 3,000 or so exhibitors here at @entity2 , nearly 500 reside in the @entity16 pavilion , a section dedicated specifically to @entity0 - related products			1
and then there are the hundreds of audio , automotive , health , gaming , and accessory companies hawking @entity26 and @entity27 peripherals			0
there are more @entity30 and @entity31 adaptors , docks and dongles than you could possibly imagine			0
vendors are showing off @entity31 camera rigs , solar - powered @entity27 batteries and even an @entity30 - connected plant sensor			0
and then there 's the sea of bedazzled and bedecked @entity30 and @entity31 cases			0
the biggest reason for this is , of course , @entity0 's dominating presence in the consumer electronic space			1
it 's a lot easier for startups and established players alike to ride @entity0 's coattails than those of , say , @entity52 or @entity53			1
" we know that @entity0 is doing well , " said @entity54 , @entity55 's director of operations			2
" we know that it 's better to make @entity0 products than anything else			2
" another advantage to going down the @entity61 is @entity0 's tight focus on a few products and form factors			2
it 's far easier to tailor accessories to @entity0 than anyone else			2
" accessory makers can reach virtually the entire installed base of @entity30 , @entity31 , and ipod touch owners with two products , determined by the connector , " the 30 pin or @entity68 , said @entity69 , an industry analyst with @entity70			1
" similarly , a case maker must create many skus for the @entity79 market , but essentially only three ( @entity80 , 4 , and 5 ) for the entire @entity30 market			0
" the relative ease with which companies can develop peripherals for @entity0 is made all the more appealing by the fact @entity0 customers have proven themselves only too happy to shell out money to accessorize their @entity88			1
" @entity0 owners have a demonstrated willingness to spend for accessories , cases , and other customizations , " @entity69 said			1
" essentially , the potential return on investment is more promising for @entity0 - related products			2
" @entity2 also shows just how willing people are to build on @entity0 's iconic " i " branding			1
there 's @entity16 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and even @entity104 all within a few feet of each other on the show floor			0
spend five minutes walking the floor and it becomes clear there 's no need for @entity0 to be here			1
hundreds of companies are only too happy to carry @entity113 's banner			0
@entity0 's presence here has grown rapidly			1
in the three years since the @entity117 launched , the space has quadrupled to 120,000 square feet , all but taking over an entire hall and pushing the automotive industry into another space			2
but does anyone wish @entity0 were actually here ? not really			2
" i do n't care , " said @entity123 , president of @entity124			0
his company is releasing an @entity30 - controlled home alarm system , which @entity123 says was inspired by the burglary of @entity129 ' house this summer			0
@entity123 said that it does n't matter that @entity0 is n't at @entity2 with a booth or keynote , because @entity2 is already the most successful and popular show for companies like his			1
@entity54 , from @entity55 , agrees			0
" at this point , i do n't think @entity0 needs to be here , " he said			1
" they have their own events and that works for them			0
" @entity55 already has eight products in the @entity143 and uses @entity2 to expand into the international market and meet clients			2
as for meetings with @entity0 , " we visit them at their campus , " @entity54 said			2
of course , @entity2 could be a much hotter destination if it had the hottest tech company involved			0
with @entity53 dropping out , @entity2 is losing even more of its sizzle			1
but the @entity154 , the organization that puts on the show , says that @entity0 skipping out is n't a big deal			1
" @entity0 is a @entity154 member			0
it 's just there prerogative to not exhibit and they 've found it more cost effective to host their own events , " @entity154 spokeswoman @entity158 said			0
" they 've never keynoted or exhibited at @entity2 , so them not being here is n't really a loss for us			1
" that 's not entirely true , since @entity0 did introduce the @entity168 at @entity2 in 1992 , but perhaps the @entity154 wants to forget this fact			1
but the fact remains that @entity0 and its products are the widely seen , and discussed , at @entity2			1
it 's here , even if it is n't			0
" they have employees that attend the show , so in that way , @entity0 sort of is here , " @entity172 said			0
follow : @entity179 's live coverage of @entity2 follow : @entity181 's live coverage of @entity2			0

*absent* from @entity2 , @entity0 still is a major presence
five hundred exhibitors are in the " @entity117 " for @entity0 accessory makers
one reason ? @entity0 customers have shown they *'re* willing to spend for *extras*
@entity0 has n't attended since 1992 ; @entity53 dropped out last year
