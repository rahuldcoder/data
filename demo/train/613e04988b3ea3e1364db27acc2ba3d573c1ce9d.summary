-- as @entity2 held a bogus referendum on independence under the watchful eye of @entity7 occupation force on march 16 , i confess that my mind and heart were elsewhere			1
i have never experienced war or the threat of annihilation			2
but now , thanks to the @entity16 , like thousands of other @entity14 - @entity13 i am living at the edge of an existential abyss			1
the violence — the war — that threatens @entity14 does not threaten me			1
i am in @entity22 and @entity14 is thousands of miles away			1
but war will threaten my friends , colleagues and family in @entity14			1
we @entity14 - @entity13 must now live with the very real possibility that their lives could be extinguished if @entity7 president @entity30 chooses to do so			1
indeed , @entity14 could even disappear as a state , if he chooses to make it disappear			1
the @entity16 has inserted the reality and possibility of mass death into our lives			0
we watch events unfold in real time			0
and we watch these events unfold all day , every day			0
ukrainians in @entity14 must live with the tangible threat of physical annihilation			1
we must live with the virtual threat			0
the consequences for them of war and violence are real : destruction and death			2
the consequences for us are virtual : we are witnesses to tragedy and mass killings			0
we watch , our eyes glued to our computer screens , and we imagine the horror			0
our empathy is not abstract : our friends , colleagues and relatives are real people			1
neither is our feeling of impotence abstract : it gnaws at our insides and reminds us that we , too , are dying , albeit spiritually			0
for three months , starting in late november , when the mass pro-democracy demonstrations began in downtown @entity71 , and ending on february 21 , when @entity14 's version of @entity73 , @entity74 , fled and people power triumphed , we had been witnessing daily regime violence punctuated by a few killings in january and mass killings just before the regime collapsed			1
every morning , turning on my computer , i wondered whether this was the day the criminal @entity74 regime would crack down , as it continually threatened to do			2
if all that happened that night was a disappearance or two , a few savage beatings and fire - bombings of cars , we @entity14 - @entity13 breathed a sigh of relief			1
you see , we had actually gotten used to daily terror			0
we , like the demonstrators in @entity14 , could live with that			2
after all , they had been living with the violence and predations of the @entity74 regime since 2010			2
what we feared above all was mass violence			0
on tuesday , february 18 , about 16 demonstrators and 10 police officers were killed			0
we were shocked and mourned their deaths , while hoping and expecting the violence to ebb			0
on wednesday , february 19 , nothing happened and our hopes appeared to be justified			0
on thursday , february 20 , the regime ordered snipers to shoot randomly at demonstrators			0
and , thanks to the @entity16 , we saw them being mowed down			0
the violence had come home			0
the criminal regime had insinuated itself into our lives			0
after @entity74 fled and a democratic government assumed power , we rejoiced			2
finally , we thought , @entity14 would be able to become " normal " -- free , democratic , liberal and @entity121			2
the death of the country had been averted			0
except that , exactly one week later , on friday , february 28 , that euphoria was replaced with the deepest of fears			0
@entity127 invaded and occupied @entity2			2
far worse was yet to come			0
on saturday , march 1 , @entity30 claimed to have the right to " defend " " @entity7 citizens " anywhere in @entity14 , thereby giving himself carte blanche to invade any part of @entity14 he chooses			1
which province would be next ? on tuesday , march 4 , our existential angst got worse			0
at a revealing press conference , @entity30 claimed he had the right to go to war with @entity14 in defense of " @entity14 citizens			1
" @entity30 also said if he made the decision to go to war , " women and children " would act as a shield for @entity7 troops			1
many @entity14 in @entity14 now believe that a @entity7 invasion of mainland @entity14 is inevitable			1
if it happens , war will break out and thousands will die			0
it 's hard to believe that @entity30 will stop with @entity2			1
@entity30 's former economic adviser @entity150 , who resigned in protest after a bloody hostage crisis , believes @entity7 armies will march on @entity71			1
@entity30 's ideological mentor , @entity154 , insists that @entity7 's goals go beyond @entity14 into @entity156 -- a reunification of the slavic peoples			1
meanwhile , @entity7 troops and tanks are massing on @entity14 's borders			1
terrified realists that we have become , we suspect the worst : that they will soon be attacking a country that dared say no to @entity30			2
as the clouds of a massive land war appear to approach @entity14 , we watch our screens with horror and hope against hope that @entity7 bombs will not begin to fall on our friends , colleagues , and family in @entity14			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178			2

@entity178 : @entity2 vote a joke : many believe war with @entity7 inevitable
he says when @entity74 was *overthrown* , @entity14 - @entity13 were euphoric
@entity178 : then @entity30 made threats ; @entity7 stole @entity2 and massed troops at border
@entity178 : @entity14 - @entity13 fear for friends and relatives in @entity14
