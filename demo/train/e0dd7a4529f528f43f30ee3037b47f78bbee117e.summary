@entity0 -- more than a decade after the @entity5 war , when one million people took to the streets to protest against intervention , @entity3 lawmakers have again been grappling with their consciences			1
in 2003 , then - prime minister @entity10 won a vote authorizing the use of force as part of a @entity16 - led coalition to overthrow @entity5 president @entity17 , but the war 's chaotic aftermath left a bitter legacy			1
last year @entity3 prime minister @entity21 lost a vote to bomb the @entity24 regime in @entity25 amid public opposition to another war			1
political commentators said the failed vote by @entity31 's long - standing ally put a brake on president @entity34 's plans to punish the @entity25 leader for allegedly using chemical weapons on his own people			1
however , the task of @entity34 in building a coalition is likely to be made easier after @entity21 easily won friday 's vote , by 524 votes to 43 , authorizing the airstrikes against @entity44 targets in @entity5			1
the opposition @entity45 supported the action against the @entity48 militant group , despite doubts of some lawmakers on both sides of the @entity52			2
opinion polls also suggest backing for action has grown following the release of videos showing the beheadings of western hostages			1
in august opinion was evenly split ( 37 - 36 % ) , according to one @entity61 poll , but is now markedly more in favor ( 53 - 26 % )			0
polling by @entity64 conducted before the death of @entity3 hostage @entity66 also found similar backing for airstrikes : more than half of those who took part in the survey backed action -- a rise of 5 % in a month			1
@entity21 recalled @entity75 after @entity5 's prime minister @entity76 requested @entity3 military support in its battle against @entity44			1
fighter planes from @entity80 and the @entity16 have already started bombing in @entity5 , but unlike in those countries the convention in @entity3 is for lawmakers to vote in @entity75 before action is taken			1
veteran political commentator @entity86 said mps were more in tune with the public than a year ago			0
" the degree of @entity44 ' brutality has changed a considerable number of minds			2
" people who previously had doubts are now convinced that there is no alternative but force			0
voices will be raised : some mps believe that bombing @entity44 may radicalize the population in areas that it controls			2
local people who never liked the @entity106 government and who may have been suffering @entity44 may now offer it their support			2
" @entity86 said it was the brutal videos that had likely won over lawmakers -- in contrast to the @entity25 vote			2
" last year @entity45 could n't support the action because mps felt there was no conclusive evidence that @entity24 had used chemical weapons against his own people			0
" mps will worry about ' mission creep ' when there is no obvious aim apart from to eradicate @entity44			2
military action may destroy the leaders but it can not eradicate ideas -- so the fear among lawmakers is that this intervention could be counter-productive			1
" outside @entity75 , there were also doubts about the military action			0
protests took place in central @entity0 on thursday , organized by @entity136			0
the group 's spokesman @entity137 said that while it was important to listen to public opinion , " once people start to see the results and start to reflect , i believe support will fall			0
" " public support for military interventions in @entity146 collapsed after the results of the bombing became clear			0
bombing increases sectarian hatred of the west , and it 's obvious that military intervention does n't work			0
you ca n't destroy terrorism by bombing infrastructure			0
it just brings more terrorism			0

@entity161 's chaotic aftermath left bitter political legacy in @entity3
@entity3 lawmakers vote to launch airstrikes on @entity44 militants
opinion polls suggest backing for action has grown in recent weeks
fear among lawmakers is that this intervention could be counter-productive
