-- @entity1 is using his masonry skills to save lives			1
since 1997 , he has built 45 footbridges over @entity6 's perilous rivers , protecting people from flash floods and predatory animals			1
the bridges also connect isolated communities with valuable resources			1
below are @entity1 's thoughts on being named a @entity14			1
@entity0 : where were you when you got the call that you 'd been selected as a @entity14 @entity14 ? @entity1 : i was in a grass - roof banda in @entity20 , where i 'd been working on a new bridge project			1
i was staring at a bat hanging from the ceiling and listening to a rat run around on the floor , trying to fall asleep			2
it was at that moment , 10:18 p.m. , when my cell phone rang			2
it 's very interesting because i normally do not have cell phone reception in this area			0
... i thought it might be my wife , so i answered the phone			0
i was surprised to hear a man 's voice			0
he introduced himself and said he wanted to share some news with me , so i said , " fire away			0
" he then told me he was happy to say that the @entity38 had selected me to be one of the @entity40 for 2010			0
to say i was excited does n't begin to describe my first reaction			0
my heart was pumping hard from the adrenaline rush , and i found myself repeating , " you have to be kidding , you have to be kidding ! " so there i was , alone , in the middle of the @entity48 bush , and a very nice gentleman from @entity50 is telling me that bridging the @entity52 's story was going to be aired on the @entity40 tribute in [ @entity54 , @entity55 ] on @entity56 evening			0
@entity57 eluded me for the rest of the night , but who needs sleep when you 've just been told that you 're a @entity62 ? to be honest , i 'm still processing it all			0
i keep thinking , " @entity1 , this is @entity0 for heaven 's sake ; you know , @entity68 , @entity69 and all the others			1
sorry for the clich√© , but i am incredibly humbled and honored by this recognition			0
i have only seen one @entity40 tribute show , and i was very moved by the amazing people who were being honored			2
to think i will soon join this prestigious family of heroes is beyond my wildest dreams			0
@entity0 : what will this recognition mean to @entity81 ? @entity1 : this recognition will be a venue to tell the story of the millions of marginalized people around the world who suffer greatly due to the dangers that rivers pose			1
i hope this story will inspire other people and organizations to start bridge - building programs like i have done			1
i also hope this will increase our financial resources so that bridging the gap can hire more staff and be even more effective			0
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity1 : i want people to know that my work is saving lives by providing safe access over perilous rivers			1
our simple bridges are incredibly effective and helping poor communities in so many ways			2
bridges are vital for health , education and commerce			0
bridges are beautiful ! i am writing from a bridge site in @entity20 where four people , sadly , drowned earlier this year			1
i wish all of you could see this setting , hear the sounds of rural @entity48 and meet this very happy community that i 'm serving			2
i can see children mirrored in my computer screen standing behind my chair as i type under the shade of an @entity130 tree -- children who will no longer have to worry about drowning in the river they paradoxically depend on as a source of life			0
when i arrived at the bridge site four days ago , i was surprised to be welcomed by more than 300 people , dressed in their bright traditional attire , singing and dancing as though it was the bridge - opening ceremony			1
this is another first for me ! in all the years i 've been building bridges , i have never been received with such enthusiasm that stems from grateful hearts			2
the 42 - meter bridge that the community and i are building together will link schools , medical clinics , churches and a market center			1
i was told by an mzee ( old man ) that more than 150 people have drowned at this crossing since 1965			2
my typical motivational speeches to work hard were not necessary in light of this community 's history and the memories of loved ones lost			0
i ca n't describe how much this simple bridge means to these people			1
it 's their @entity163 .			1

@entity1 is *transforming* @entity6 communities by building footbridges over perilous rivers
many people in rural @entity6 still fall *victim* to flash floods and predatory animals
@entity1 on his *current* bridge project : " this is their @entity163 "
