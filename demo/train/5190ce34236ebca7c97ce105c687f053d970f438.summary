@entity1 , @entity0 -- nothing says true love like releasing a caged butterfly , do n't you think ? @entity7 and @entity8 are to be paid $ 5 million for the picture rights to their wedding			1
the butterflies are reported to be the piece - de - resistance of @entity0 's most anticipated celebrity wedding of the year			1
@entity7 , the best @entity0 footballer of his generation , and @entity8 , his @entity16 sweetheart , were to marry in an estimated $ 10 million ceremony in @entity18 thursday			1
as they kiss , guests are apparently meant to open boxes and release the butterflies			0
the moment has been pilloried widely in the @entity24 media , tacky and over the top they all think , but is it just sour grapes ? it has been a long and , at times , bumpy road for the couple to the altar			1
one littered with fierce criticism from the @entity24 press , which has enjoyed nothing more than lampooning @entity7 and @entity8 for being ' common			1
' the @entity37 once even asked : " is this @entity24 's ghastliest couple ? " @entity7 has been dubbed " @entity45 " and " mr @entity46 " due to his looks and his background as the son of a school dinner lady who grew up on a council estate is often referred to in a disparaging way			1
@entity8 , meanwhile , has been subjected to page upon page of bitter stories about her weight , shopping sprees and her lack of closeness to @entity54			2
there has also been fierce criticism over the fact she has managed to become a millionaire in her own right			0
it 's all down to @entity7 apparently , and nothing to do with her appearing to be quite a decent person , who did well at school and has cleverly managed to parlay some of her fame into various media and advertising projects			1
anyone who has seen her television show -- @entity8 's @entity71 -- can see she is a decent , bubbly person , who is very good at putting people at ease			0
much to the media 's fury , the couple have sold the rights to cover the wedding to ok magazine for a record $ 5 million			2
however they 're not pocketing all the cash themselves , with an undisclosed sum from the fee to be donated to the @entity85 in @entity86 -- where @entity8 's disabled foster sister @entity87 is cared for			0
the queen 's grandson , @entity88 and his bride @entity90 , recently received $ 1m from @entity79 to cover their wedding but they did n't receive an eighth of the opprobrium now directed at the more generous , but lower class , @entity7 and @entity8			1
moreover , in lieu of presents , @entity7 and @entity8 have also asked guests to donate money to the @entity99 in @entity100			2
the wedding might be over the top , with a private yacht and luxury jet for guests ( they are covering the guests ' costs ) , expensive plonk and a $ 200,000 wedding dress , but at least the couple have worked hard for what they have			0
their success despite a working - class background appears to be the greatest source of frustration for critics			1
it 's just not on that someone who was n't born into privilege and did n't go to a posh school can enjoy their wealth			0
if anything , the couple 's relationship and success is a triumph over adversity			0
they have known each other since @entity8 was 12 , but she spent two years fending off @entity7 's entreaties to go out on a date			2
he finally got his chance when he saw her struggling to fix a broken bicycle chain			0
he rode over to help , popped the question again and got a yes			0
surely they should be congratulated for creating their own modern fairytale complete with butterflies ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0
