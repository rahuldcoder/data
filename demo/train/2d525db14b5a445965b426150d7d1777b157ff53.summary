@entity3 @entity2 gov. @entity1 's political brand is built almost entirely around a single personality trait : authenticity			1
he 's a self - styled what - you - see - is - what - you - get kind of politician , unapologetic that his blunt style can come across as brash			1
the approach has earned @entity1 plenty of love for being himself and sets him apart from other potential 2016 presidential contenders such as @entity18 and @entity19 , who often come across as stiffer and more disciplined			1
@entity1 's authenticity was on full display this week when he stood by his beloved @entity22			1
in the face of @entity25 bullies who shunned his love for @entity28 or mocked his bear hug with @entity30 , @entity1 brazenly defended his lifelong loyalty for an out - of - state team that 's either the most loved or most hated franchise in the @entity33			1
" you are who you are as a fan , " the @entity34 said in a radio interview on monday			0
while he faced scrutiny for his long - distance affair with the @entity22 , he won some admiration for not pandering all these years by switching to a local team			1
former @entity45 campaign manager @entity44 tweeted that it " takes guts " for @entity1 to back the rival @entity22 when he 's " surrounded by @entity48 , @entity49 & @entity50 fans			1
" but @entity1 's insistence on remaining true to himself is the same quality that has gotten him in trouble over the years and , if left unchecked , could run the risk of being seen as more schtick than authentic			1
it was just a few months ago when @entity1 shouted at a heckler who was interrupting an event to " sit down and shut up ! " the moment became instant fuel for critics to push a narrative of @entity1 as a bully and paint the governor as a loose cannon who 's not ready for the presidential stage			1
in an interview with @entity72 's @entity71 , @entity1 argued that he never lost control and knew exactly what he was doing when he gave the heckler a verbal beat down			1
" i 'm not going to change , @entity77 is who i am , " he said			0
asked whether @entity1 can learn to hide that part of his personality , the governor said " there 's no hope in that			1
" trying to get it just right voters often say they 're looking for real , genuine candidates			0
but striking that perfect balance of authenticity without being too hot or too cold is " one of the most difficult lines to navigate " for a politician , said @entity34 strategist @entity93			1
it 's a tough cycle to break out of , experts say			1
no one is perfect and if a candidate tries to be himself or herself entirely , flaws will eventually be exposed			1
but those flaws could result in criticism or negative media coverage , which then prompts politicians to be more guarded			1
there 's no steadfast rule to finding just the right middle ground			1
" and that balance is different for every candidate because you do n't know what the candidate is going to do until you shine the spotlight on them , " @entity93 said			0
@entity114 , a presidential historian who 's written two books on @entity116 , says the authenticity factor for voters dates back to president @entity119 and has seen periods of popularity off and on ever since			1
its most recent resurgence started with @entity124 in 1976 , not long after @entity125 resigned amid the @entity126			0
" the @entity128 people had had it with all the corruption in @entity3 , " he said			0
@entity124 frequently used the word " trust " in his campaign and invoked his @entity135 and farmer roots as a way to build a populist reputation			0
" people were just hungry for something different			0
" previous elections during the 2012 @entity34 primaries , @entity141 was often accused of being too robotic and not showing his true cards			1
@entity144 called him out on a primary debate stage once , telling him to cut the " pious baloney			0
" the rebuke came after @entity141 answered a question about why he did n't run for re-election as governor of @entity151			1
@entity141 said he simply wanted to help the state get into good shape , then return to the private sector			0
" for me , politics is not a career , " @entity141 said			0
yet in reality , @entity141 ran for president shortly thereafter in 2007 , and in addition to his successful 2002 bid for governor , he ran for @entity162 in a failed 1994 attempt			1
similarly , @entity164 was noted for having difficulty appearing comfortable in his own skin and was criticized for trying to adopt a regular guy persona			0
in @entity169 in presidential campaigns , author @entity168 notes that voters in 2000 sided with @entity164 on nearly every issue in the polls , but fell well behind @entity174 on questions about character , honesty and personality			0
whether voters consider a candidate authentic is also heavily dependent on how successful opponents are at defining them			0
president @entity45 's campaign and allies , for example , spent millions trying to craft @entity141 as greedy and out - of - touch because of his background in private equity			1
@entity188 also been accused of struggling with authenticity , particularly during her 2000 @entity162 campaign in @entity192 when she said she was a lifelong @entity193 fan despite having grown up as a fan of her hometown team , the @entity195			2
@entity188 struggled to connect with voters during much of her 2008 campaign			0
@entity188 's supporters argue she was in fact a @entity193 fan as a child and photos from 1992 published in her 2003 memoir " @entity206 " show her in a @entity192 hat			2
still , @entity1 mentioned the @entity188 example in a 2013 radio interview defending his adoration of the @entity22			1
" i 'm not going to be @entity18 , ok ? i 'm not going to , you know , be a @entity195 fan my whole life , and then when i go to run for office in another state , pretend i 'm a @entity193 fan , " he said " i do n't think there 's anything -- in sports -- more reprehensible than that			2
" a challenging cycle on the flip side , when politicians try to be themselves in the public eye , they may wind up saying or doing something that people find politically incorrect , offensive or careless			1
vice president @entity228 has gotten in trouble for being too candid at times , or as some like to say , @entity228 just being @entity228			2
he took his freewheeling approach to the @entity162 this week , where he joked around -- sometimes awkwardly -- with senators and their families as he swore in lawmakers for a new term			0
one of @entity228 's most memorable moments was when he endorsed same - sex marriage in may 2012 , before president @entity45 had officially evolved on the issue			2
@entity228 has frequently tried to clarify his off - the - cuff remarks with a go - to line : " no one ever doubts i mean what i say , but sometimes i say all that i mean			2
" renowned surgeon and conservative activist @entity247 , who 's known for making controversial comments , is also sometimes too honest for his own good , his spokesman acknowledged last month			2
" if i could create the @entity254 's dictionary of words dr. @entity247 could use in the campaign , there would be some words i 'd leave out , " @entity250 told the @entity251			2
" like ' @entity258 ' or ' @entity259			0
' " @entity260 , a @entity34 strategist and pollster , said a good politician is almost by definition careful with what they say and how they say it			0
" that does n't mean they ca n't be candid or they ca n't be clear or they ca n't say what they mean , but it does mean that they ca n't say the first words that come into their brains without thinking about the consequences , " he said			0
@entity1 is certainly aware that he has to tone himself down at times			1
when he was in @entity281 last september , reporters noticed the governor was acting more guarded and restrained than his normal @entity284 self			2
in an interview with the @entity286 , he acknowledged that he can be " flamboyant " at times			0
" but it does n't mean that 's the way i am all of the time , " he added			2
being able to adjust to different contexts is an important perquisite for leadership , he continued			0
" you know , i have more than one club in the bag , and i 've demonstrated that over time , " he said			0
it 's unclear whether voters in @entity299 or @entity300 will buy @entity1 's explanation , or whether it will break past opposition ads and attacks against his personality			1
@entity1 has dismissed such skepticism as " garbage " and forcefully defended his style in a radio interview this summer			1
" yeah there are some ... regional differences in our country			0
but in the end , people like people who are genuine , who are real , " he continued			0
" people who are real do well			0
and they 're happy , too			0
" " i would rather lose than try to pretend to be somebody else , " he added			0
@entity93 , the @entity34 strategist , acknowledges there 's always a risk in being too much of yourself on the campaign trail			2
but at the end of the day , he argued , " it 's better to be too authentic than to be too plastic			2
" @entity4 's @entity327 and @entity328 contributed to this report .			2

@entity1 's *fierce* loyalty to the @entity22 demonstrates the governor 's authenticity
but that quality of staying true to himself has gotten him in trouble in other aspects
experts say it 's hard for politicians to find that fine line of being themselves without exposing flaws
