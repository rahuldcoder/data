this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity12 , @entity13 : i 'm @entity15 , and fridays are awesome , especially when they start with a former @entity18 star			1
@entity19 , @entity18 running back : what 's up ! i 'm @entity19 , and this is @entity0			1
check it out ! first up : @entity4 in crisis @entity25 : scenes of celebration turn to shouts of anger as the crisis in @entity4 takes a new turn			1
this political unrest in the @entity34 nation started late last month			1
thousands of protesters marching in the streets , calling for a change in leadership			1
their main target : long - time president @entity40			1
these protesters want him out of office now			1
yesterday , a huge crowd showed up in the downtown square where a lot of these protests have been going on			1
the people there were cheering , getting ready for a speech that president @entity40 was scheduled to make , and the rumors were that he was going to step down			1
during his speech , @entity40 said that he will keep his promise to leave office in the fall after new elections			1
he said that he 's delegating power to the vice president			1
and he said that he will respond to protesters ' demands			1
what he did not say was that he would immediately leave office			1
the response from the crowd in the square was immediate , and it was angry			1
crowds began chanting " get out " as the president spoke			1
this is a dynamic situation ; things are changing ; they 're developing all the time			1
we want you to go to @entity73 for the latest updates			2
is this legit ? @entity75 , @entity13 : is this legit ? the next @entity77 presidential election takes place on november 6 , 2011			1
not true ! it 's exactly one year after that , on november 6 , 2012			2
2012 contenders @entity25 : the election might be 21 months away , but the lines are forming for people who may want to get into the race			2
and a convention happening right now in @entity5 may offer some ideas about who will be on the ballot			2
it 's @entity91 , the @entity91			2
thousands of conservatives from across the country are spending three days in the nation 's capital			2
they 'll hear speeches from some big names in the @entity99 , and they 'll take part in a straw poll			2
it 's an unofficial vote , and this one includes 15 candidates			2
some analysts use these polls to make predictions about who might end up running for president			1
@entity110 is @entity73 's senior @entity111 correspondent ; no stranger to the presidential campaign trail			2
he 's here to help explain some of the pros and cons of running for the country 's highest political office			1
( begin video ) @entity110 , @entity73 sr. @entity120 : when we take a close look at the contenders for 2012 , we obviously need to include the sitting president of the @entity77			1
but while incumbency has its privileges , it also clearly brings some challenges as well			1
call it the power of the presidency			1
especially that 416 - ton , taxpayer - financed jet that helps you rally voters , rake in millions , and grab headlines from coast to coast			2
@entity137 , @entity139 strategist : when he goes into local markets -- you 've been all over with him -- he sucks all the oxygen out of the air			2
@entity143 : allowing president @entity144 to road - test a potential 2012 campaign slogan popping up on new t - shirts that say " we do big things			1
" @entity144 , @entity150 : we can do what this moment demands and focus on what 's necessary for @entity77 to win the future			1
@entity143 : but incumbency also has a downside			2
@entity158 , @entity160 chairman : they do bad things , and the policies that they 've imposed have not helped us get unemployment down to where it ought to be			2
@entity143 : the candidate of hope and change in 2008 was largely a blank slate			2
now , he has to defend a controversial record , which is why he tried to hit the reset button and focus on jobs in his @entity176			2
but the crisis in @entity4 is a reminder : sometimes incumbents set the agenda , other times it gets set for them			1
so far , there 's no sign of a serious primary challenge to the president			2
and he may also be helped by the @entity99 ' muddled field so far			2
but @entity158 argues that tough competition could help the @entity99 , just like the @entity139 primary of 2008			2
@entity192 , secretary of state : shame on you , @entity144 ! @entity143 : while the pundits warned that the long drama of @entity198 v. @entity144 would hurt the party , just the opposite happened			2
@entity200 : it made @entity144 better when he emerged as the nominee			0
he was a stronger nominee for it			0
@entity143 : by 2012 , the president will have had four years of hand - to - hand combat , this time with @entity99			0
the big question now is whether those battles have , once again , made him a stronger nominee			0
( @entity210 ) @entity211 @entity212 , @entity13 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity215 's 6th grade social studies students in @entity217 , @entity218 ! which @entity77 president is known as the " @entity220 " ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity5 , @entity224 or @entity225 ) @entity226 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! president @entity220 , or @entity220 , is also known as the @entity220			1
