a murder weapon is n't the only thing missing as prosecutors try to convince jurors that former @entity6 @entity5 orchestrated the execution of @entity8			1
the shoes prosecutors say @entity5 was wearing at the industrial park where @entity8 was killed also have seemingly vanished into thin air			1
" the shoes and footprints caused by the shoes ( are ) a big deal , " says @entity1 legal analyst @entity13 , a former homicide prosecutor			0
a big deal because connecting an athletic shoe impression found near @entity8 's body to @entity5 could help prove he directly participated in @entity8 's death			1
@entity8 , 27 , was shot once in the back and six times in the front in june 2013 -- the final two bullets fired as he lay face up , according to the medical examiner			2
@entity5 has pleaded not guilty			1
@entity5 's downward spiral the sneakers prosecutors believe @entity5 wore the night of @entity8 's death were within the grasp of investigators who visited the ex-football star 's home , but it appears no one knew it at the time			1
investigators photographed a pair of @entity42 @entity41 brand sneakers during one of their first searches of @entity5 's home , according to court papers , but did not take them in as evidence			1
when @entity8 's body was discovered , crime scene investigators singled out one of two footwear impressions early on because one did n't match the " lugged sole " shoes of police , nor the shoes of first responders or civilian witnesses who found @entity8 's body , according to court documents			1
when police began executing search warrants for weapons and clothing at @entity5 's home on june 18 and june 22 , 2013 , they also were looking for shoes that could match that print in the dirt , according to court files and testimony			1
so far , jurors have not been told that somehow three other sets of sneakers neatly lined up side by side along a bedroom wall in the basement were overlooked , and " appeared to be in good condition , " according to an affidavit			0
the basement is where @entity5 's man cave is located and is complete with bar , a screening room , a pool table with a @entity6 's logo , and a trophy room			1
that affidavit dated november 14 , 2014 , says that after studying images and home security video and having " consulted with @entity42 , " investigators believe those three pairs of shoes are " believed to be produced by @entity42 and @entity91			0
" they are the white and black @entity94 , the red @entity96 low tops ; and the brown @entity42 winterized spike sneakers allegedly worn by @entity5 , @entity98 and @entity99 , respectively			2
@entity98 and @entity99 are also charged with the murder of @entity8			2
they have pleaded not guilty and are going to be tried separately			2
@entity98 and @entity99 are seen on home security video entering the house and going into the basement after getting out of a car minutes after @entity8 was fatally shot in a nearby industrial park			0
prosecutors say the cable connecting the basement security camera , labeled " man cave , " was unplugged after the three men went downstairs			0
authorities say the " outsole pattern , " of the @entity114 @entity41 's allegedly worn by @entity5 is " similar to and consistent with the unidentified shoe impression ... in close proximity to the body of @entity8 , " according to the affidavit			1
it also states the @entity120 became available for public sale only three weeks before @entity8 's murder			1
yet , it was n't until almost a year and a half later , when investigators were making final trial preparations last november , that they " noted " the three pairs of shoes in photographs and realized they could still be at @entity5 's home , a search warrant affidavit states			1
in court papers , investigators said the sneakers appear to match shoe prints found at the scene where @entity8 was fatally shot			2
in order to look again , police asked a court to approve another search warrant			0
the application also points out home surveillance video showing @entity98 and @entity99 leaving the home after the shooting -- wearing sandals			0
trying to make the case for another search , investigators also quote a jailhouse phone call dated december 25 , 2013 , between @entity5 and his fiancee @entity148			2
@entity5 told @entity148 , " you still got my , my clothes at the house and s â€” ? " @entity148 responded , " i really do n't understand			0
i mean , where do you think your clothes are ? ... your clothes are exactly where they 're supposed to be ...			0
. i mean , you 've only been gone for what , six months ? " " yeah , " @entity5 said			0
" you act like you 're gon na be gone for like , 20 years , " @entity148 replied			0
but when police searched the home again on november 24 , they did n't find the shoes			0
details about the missing @entity42 sneakers have not yet come up at trial			0
how might it play with the jury ? " jurors will wonder why did n't investigators seize the shoes at the same time they seized many other pieces of evidence from @entity5 's home , " says @entity168 law professor @entity167 , who 's closely monitoring the trial			1
" if jurors determine investigators and prosecutors simply made a mistake in not seizing the shoes , it could damage the jurors ' confidence in the case			2
it 's possible prosecutors could try to mollify this concern by noting that rules of evidence and pretrial discovery limit the types of evidence they can be taken from a person 's home			0

shoes prosecutors say @entity5 wore on night of @entity8 's death are missing
@entity5 is on trial for murder of @entity8 and has pleaded not guilty
linking shoes to impressions at crime scene would help prosecution with its case
