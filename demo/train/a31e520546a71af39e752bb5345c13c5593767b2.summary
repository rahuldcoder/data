artists tend to occupy the front lines against repression			0
so it comes as no surprise that the occupation of @entity7 's @entity6 protesting the " @entity10 " of the ministry under the leadership of @entity9 has helped drive the planned massive demonstrations against @entity13 on sunday			1
once again , the @entity15 government appears to be on the fence in @entity7 , with ambassador @entity17 expressing skepticism about " street action " that could result in violent protests			1
" people realize that this is about the identity of @entity7 , " said @entity21 , a scholar active in the culture of @entity6 occupation			2
with @entity27 ( militant soccer fans ) standing by to protect the growing crowds , nightly performances are held outside the ministry , ranging from ballet to an impromptu concert by pop star @entity33 that even had the police dancing			0
artists of @entity37 's famed @entity36 -- on strike since @entity9 fired its head , @entity40 -- have been performing , too			0
their repertoire ? excerpts from " zorba the @entity43 , " including scenes of defiance			0
expressing a sentiment increasingly heard in taxis and on the streets of @entity37 , the actress @entity47 said , " our protest at the @entity6 is just part and parcel of the struggle of the @entity7 against the colonization of the @entity57			1
" the @entity57 is as an international organization with loyalty to its members , not to @entity7			2
she speaks for many , including people who voted for @entity13 in the last election			2
however , @entity65 , the @entity15 ambassador , recently equated protests with " violence on the streets " and urged @entity7 to " get organized ... to join or start a political party that reflects your values and aspirations			1
" what revolution has ever succeeded in the short term ( and 2Â½ years is a short term ) without taking to the streets ? yes , @entity7 need to become better organized politically , but at this early tumultuous stage , that is a long - term goal			1
@entity65 's condescending comments ignore history , as well as the specific situation in @entity7			1
for example , recently a court sentenced employees of nongovernmental organizations to jail , effectively curtailed activities of these groups that provide advice and support for the kind of political activities for which the ambassador advocated			2
@entity65 's dismissal of " street action " as likely only to " add new names to the lists of martyrs " not only insults the millions of @entity7 who have marched in the streets to change their country for the better , but it also stands at odds with president @entity103 's words of praise for the @entity7 revolution of 2011 : " we stand for universal values , including the rights of the @entity7 people to freedom of assembly , freedom of speech			1
... " what was the @entity7 revolution if not " street action " ? it was left to another @entity15 " ambassador " to lend support to @entity7			1
on june 21 , @entity116 appeared on @entity7 satirist @entity118 's popular show , " @entity119 , " and told the audience : " @entity118 is showing that satire ... can carve out a space in a country for people to express themselves			2
because that is all democracy is ... the ability to express yourself and be heard			0
" ironically , in targeting cultural leaders , including @entity118 , the @entity57 has helped unify its opposition			0
for the artists are the canaries in the coal mine , who lead the way in questioning authority and in holding up a mirror to society			0
as fate would have it , the sit - ins at the @entity6 and the nightly performances of dance , music and street theater coincided with the growth of the grass - roots @entity147 movement , which says it has collected more than 15 million signatures in order to force @entity13 to call for early elections			1
just as with the 2011 revolution , this " second revolution " began with youth activists , many of them artists , and now has spread like wildfire through the population			0
stories abound of traffic stopping in @entity37 to accommodate @entity147 volunteers weaving through cars to gather signatures , often to spontaneous applause			0
reflecting the mood of revolution in the air , @entity118 recently hosted an @entity168 version of " @entity169 " on his show			0
as the studio audience joined the singing group @entity175 in a rousing finale of " do you hear the @entity181 ? " to inspire @entity7 with " the music of the people who will not be slaves again , " artists and activists outside continued their vigil for freedom of expression at the @entity6			2
no one knows what will happen sunday			0
feelings of excitement mix with anxiety about the potential for violence , which the recent thug attack on protesters in @entity194 forebodes			0
but the energy of the young activists behind @entity147 , the passion of the artists inside and outside the @entity6 , and the unified opposition to @entity13 's rule show that the @entity7 revolution is far from over			1
" street action " is the kernel of revolution .			1

@entity206 : @entity7 plan sunday protest against president @entity13
@entity206 : @entity15 ambassador to @entity7 ignores history by being skeptical about " street action "
@entity206 asks : what revolution has succeeded in the short term without taking to the streets ?
the opposition to @entity13 shows that the @entity7 revolution is not over , she says
