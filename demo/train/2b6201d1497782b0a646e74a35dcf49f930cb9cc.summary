-- look , up in the sky ! it 's a bird ! it 's a plane ! it 's @entity5 ! what the heck was that flaming thing streaking across @entity9 skies ? @entity9 in cities from @entity11 to @entity12 reported -- and , in some cases , filmed -- a large , burning object crossing the sky last week			1
unlike the meteor that hit @entity18 in february 2013 , this sky phenomenon was manmade			1
scientists quickly realized that it was the third stage of a @entity18 soyuz rocket used to launch a weather satellite july 8			1
some , like @entity23 ( @ planet4589 ) of the @entity24 and @entity25 - winning @entity9 astronomer @entity26 ( @ cosmicpinot ) , spread the news on @entity28			1
although the @entity31 fireworks were spectacular enough to be alarming , most space debris falls harmlessly to @entity32 , completely unnoticed			1
some spacecraft parts fall within days of launch but most over considerably longer time scales			2
in the nearly six decades since @entity37 became the first satellite to orbit the @entity32 in 1957 , humans have launched 7,500 satellites into orbit , according to @entity23			1
those in low @entity41 -- about 300 miles up -- travel through a very thin atmosphere that acts as a gradual brake on the satellite trajectory			2
absent any human intervention , those satellites slowly spiral toward @entity32 over 10 or 20 years , depending on their exact orbit and the spacecraft shape			2
the @entity49 has been in low @entity41 for 24 years and counting only because astronauts boosted it back to a higher orbit at every space shuttle servicing visit			0
more than a thousand active satellites are orbiting the @entity32 right now			2
slightly more than half are in low @entity32 orbit , including @entity49 and the space station			1
almost all the rest are in geosynchronous orbit , meaning they circle the @entity32 at the same rate it rotates			2
for a telecommunications company serving the @entity65 , it 's obviously a big advantage to have a satellite hovering above the country all the time			1
a geosynchronous 24 - hour orbital period requires a very high - altitude orbit			0
according to @entity73 's 400 - year - old law of gravity , orbital speed depends only on the mass of the body being orbited ( in this case , the @entity32 ) and the radius of the orbit ( the radius of the @entity32 plus the height of the satellite above the @entity32 )			1
that 's why @entity49 , the much larger space station , the much smaller early satellites like @entity37 and @entity85 , and any other low @entity32 - orbit satellite take only 90 minutes to circle the globe			1
geosynchronous satellites are way , way up there			0
those orbits wo n't decay anytime soon			0
it 's the low @entity32 orbit satellites that will fall down			1
or rather , the dead satellite and related debris that ca n't be controlled by engineers at space agencies			2
active satellites can be controlled from the ground ; for example , @entity49 is continually repointed from one part of the sky to another as it observes this galaxy or that star			0
as the blockbuster movie " gravity " showed us , uncontrolled space debris can be very dangerous			1
in the movie , a @entity18 missile destroys a defunct satellite , starting a destructive and deadly chain reaction of debris destroying other satellites destroying still more satellites -- and , ultimately , destroying the space station in which the astronauts were based			1
in 1985 , the @entity65 demonstrated anti-missile @entity121 capabilities by blowing up a solar observatory named @entity123			0
not only did this halt the science , it created a swarm of tiny pieces of debris			0
@entity129 did a similar thing in 2007			0
as physics tells us , blowing something up does n't make it vanish ; it just makes lots of tiny pieces moving more quickly			0
and smaller pieces are much harder to spot and track			0
the @entity137 tracks space objects			0
its @entity139 has catalogued more than 39,000 manmade objects in orbit			0
about 60 % have re-entered the atmosphere ; 16,000 remain in orbit today			0
of these , only about 5 % are functioning satellites or payloads that can be controlled , while 95 % is inactive space junk , including rocket bodies			1
@entity148 estimates that there are half a million pieces of space junk floating around the @entity32 , most too small to be tracked			1
but even bits of debris no bigger than a gumdrop can cause serious damage			0
satellite technology has made it easy to phone around the globe , to a metropolis or even to @entity161			0
the downside is , pieces of satellites are going to fall back onto @entity32			2
thankfully , only the largest solid hunks fail to burn up before reaching the ground			0
in 1979 , @entity148 's @entity167 ( a much earlier version of the space station ) famously fell to @entity32 amid nail - biting worry			1
a few scraps were recovered in @entity9 ( poor @entity9 , again ! )			2
bits of @entity173 ( a @entity175 x-ray astronomy observatory ) and other satellites have also fallen to @entity32			2
it is easy to calculate the path of the re-entering spacecraft because it is along the track of the orbit			0
but how quickly it descends depends on details that are much harder to predict			0
it makes a big difference how the structure burns and how it falls apart			2
bigger pieces continue to hurtle downward while smaller pieces burn completely high up in the atmosphere			0
that 's why predictions of where space debris will land are notoriously uncertain			1
the good news is that only one - quarter of the surface of the @entity32 is land , and most of that is uninhabited			1
so damage to people and property is rare			0
most falling space debris lands harmlessly and with no witnesses			1
the likelihood of serious damage is very low			0
but a big hunk of metal -- or a large asteroid -- falling in the wrong place could be catastrophic			1
it 's definitely a good idea to keep the @entity167 - sized space junk controllable and to catalog asteroids that will pass near the @entity32			1
but in the end , whether we go the way of the dinosaurs might just be down to luck .			0

a piece of space junk from a @entity18 rocket flew through the @entity9 sky
@entity226 : space debris falls to @entity32 all the time ; most is harmless
but a big hunk of metal -- or a large asteroid -- could be catastrophic , she says
@entity226 : it 's definitely a good idea to keep the @entity167 - sized space junk controllable
