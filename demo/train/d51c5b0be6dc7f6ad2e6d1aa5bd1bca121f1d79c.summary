@entity0 -- @entity2 is one step away from golfing immortality , but it did n't come easily			1
perhaps that is the way it should be , given the 25 - year - old 's two - shot victory at the @entity10 has elevated him into exalted company			1
only two players have completed three legs of a grand slam by that age -- @entity16 and @entity17 -- a potent pair with 32 majors between them			2
sunday 's victory at @entity0 means it is only the @entity23 masters that eludes him , a tournament which inflicted such a cruel fate back in 2011			2
when @entity2 wins majors , he usually wins big			1
his previous pair -- the @entity30 in 2011 , and the @entity31 in 2013 -- had both been secured at a canter , eight shots the margin to second best			0
out in front by six shots at the start of the day @entity2 stumbled round the links , scrapping and clawing away at the course to maintain his advantage			1
his main challenger was n't playing partner @entity42 but friend and @entity45 comrade @entity44 , of @entity46 , who charged round the first 10 holes in five - under par. at one stage , @entity2 's lead had been whittled to a mere two shots , but while the @entity53 's nerve wobbled , @entity2 's held			1
@entity44 took two shots to get out of a green side bunker on the 15th and @entity2 made a birdie on the 16th to stretch his lead to three			1
he could even afford to find a bunker on the last for a par - five to finish on 17 - under for the championship			2
@entity44 and @entity42 finished tied for second on 15 - under			1
" there was a better player , " @entity44 said after shooting an impressive 66			2
" it 's as simple as that			0
" perhaps this leg of the hat - trick is the one that will give @entity2 greatest satisfaction , given he had to grind his way to the finish line amid the constant strain of pressure and expectation			1
his celebration was one that betrayed the relief he felt at getting the job done			0
now all that is left is to conquer those demons at @entity80			0
after being presented with his prize , @entity2 told reporters : " it feels absolutely incredible			2
" i 'm happy i gave myself a cushion because there were a lot of guys coming at me especially @entity44 and @entity42			1
" just to be sitting here and looking at this thing and having my name on it , is a great feeling			0
" it has n't sunk in yet and i 'm going to enjoy it and let it sink in tonight in the company of my friends and family			0
" as the 25 - year - old himself acknowledged on saturday , there will be a mountain of hype when he heads to @entity80 next april , but for now it is all about @entity2 's transformation on the links			1
his @entity108 @entity10 career was locked in reverse -- finishes of 25 and 60 were followed by a missed cut at @entity111 last year -- but all it took to arrest the decline was a spell of intense practice back at the place he learned the game			1
he told @entity1 prior to the tournament he had been honing his game on the links courses of his native @entity121 in preparation for an assault on golf 's oldest major			1
two opening rounds of 66 were followed by a 68 on saturday when a scintillating salvo -- two eagles in his closing three holes -- had broken the back of the field and opened up a six - shot lead			0
unless one of those within clawing distance could tear up the course and induce panic , @entity2 could cruise home on the banks of the @entity139			2
it turns out , pretty much everyone did			0
his sunday score was the worst of the top 13 finishers			0
while @entity42 never managed to get within striking distance -- three late birdies helping him clamber back into joint - second -- @entity44 ensured the threat of @entity2 running aground remained constant			1
both birdied the opening hole as thunderous applause followed them down the first , ten minutes apart			0
bogeys on five and six opened the door , and from the galleries following the group up ahead cheers were thick and frequent			0
@entity44 , a long - standing crowd favorite , had three birdies to his name as he strolled off the fifth green , and the deficit stood at three			2
when @entity2 's approach from the rough at seven pitched on the brow of the bunker and dropped back into the sand , a heavy groan from the gallery told its own story			2
he recovered to make his par then sunk a birdie chance at nine to balance his nerves			0
@entity172 was , a monstrous roar up ahead signaled a @entity44 eagle on 10 , and the clutch of @entity46 who had made the trip started to believe			2
two fierce blows offered @entity2 the chance to hit straight back , and he duly did			0
by this stage @entity0 crackled with tension , as those following the final two groups relayed information to those around them while listening intently to their radios			0
a sea of @entity188 voices that had made their way across the narrow strait between the @entity191 and @entity192 became a little more desperate in their pleas			0
@entity2 offered further encouragement with a dropped stroke at 14 but a run of four consecutive pars , albeit on a tricky stretch of the course , frustrated @entity44 -- still searching for his first major at the 63rd time of asking			1
his hopes expired on the par three 15th as he found a bunker and took two to emerge			0
@entity2 , watching from the tee , could breathe a little easier			0
@entity44 duly birdied the par five 16th , little more than a gim me with a helpful wind blowing off the @entity208 , but @entity2 answered straight back with one of his own			1
by that stage the questions marks were slowly evaporating			0
a par back into the wind on the 17th was secured with a delicate chip from right of the green and though @entity44 duly made birdie on the final hole , @entity2 knew the @entity10 was all but his			1
despite firing his approach on 18 into the bunker , he duly carved out his ball and rolled his birdie putt close , tapping in as some 7,000 people surrounding the green hailed their champion			0
it was the final shot of a day marked by more low scoring , with 64 - year - old @entity23 @entity45 captain @entity226 shooting a four - under 68 to finish one one - over			1
by contrast , former world number one @entity17 closed the tournament on six - over - par and in 69th , his worst ever finish at the oldest major .			1

@entity2 wins @entity10 at @entity0
@entity2 finishes two shots clear of @entity44 and @entity42
third major title for 25 - year - old from @entity121
@entity17 records worst finish at @entity10
