@entity0 -- thursday 's opening of the @entity4 september 11 @entity3 in @entity0 was 13 years in the making			1
museum officials consulted hundreds of people -- survivors , relatives of the victims , rescue workers , community leaders and others -- as they determined what should be included in the exhibits occupying the halls beneath the footprints of the @entity18			2
while that effort has been applauded by many for being a fitting , emotional telling of one of the darkest days in @entity25 history , it is not without its controversies			0
among them is a seven - minute film entitled " @entity29 of @entity30			1
" the documentary tells the story of the growth of a worldwide terrorist organization			0
the film , which features video of @entity30 training camps and previous attacks , plays next to a room where photos of the 9/11 attackers are on display			1
the inclusion of that story is not the problem			0
but the use of words like " jihad " and " @entity49 " in the narration prompted some @entity51 and others to call for edits			1
" we feel that there is unfortunate messaging in referencing to @entity59 , " said @entity54 of the @entity55			0
his wife was a first responder who aided in the search - and - rescue effort after the attacks			2
@entity65 fears that millions of visitors will walk away from the documentary believing that @entity59 is to blame for 9/11			0
the rev. @entity68 , executive director of the @entity69 , was part of a museum advisory council that was given an opportunity to view the documentary			2
" the film loosely and without sufficient definition or context describes the rise of @entity30 and uses terms that are confusing and controversial , " she said			1
@entity68 said the the film is the only museum display that appears to assign blame			1
" it 's the one thing in there that suggests who to blame , " she said			0
" and to do that , it requires the kind of depth and nuance and sophistication that the rest of the museum has			2
it 's a very delicate and difficult complex question , and they do n't go anywhere near addressing it			0
" she said interfaith leaders unsuccessfully recommended a " contextual statement at the very beginning that says this video is about the historical rise of @entity30 and does not relate to the history of @entity59			1
" @entity65 and @entity68 belong to a group of interfaith leaders who claim the museum 's leadership has turned a deaf ear to their concerns			2
" no one will come through this exhibit and , in any way , think that we are indicting an entire religion , which we in no way are , " said @entity111 , president of the @entity4 september 11 @entity3			1
in a statement , museum officials said : " a major part of preserving the history of september 11 is to show who was responsible for the monstrous attack on @entity25 that led to the deaths of thousands of innocent people of various ethnicities and religious beliefs			1
this brief film , within the context of surrounding exhibits , focuses on the roots of @entity30 with the express purpose of helping visitors understand who perpetrated the 9/11 terrorist attacks			1
it does not purport to be a film about @entity59 or in any way generalize that @entity139 are terrorists			0
" national security expert @entity140 , a fellow at the @entity141 , a think tank , said the film needs a more nuanced approach to telling the story of the terrorists			1
" they acted in the name of their religion			0
i do n't dispute that , " said @entity140			0
" i want that when an @entity25 or anyone else goes through the museum , that when they watch the movie , they leave more informed			0
" 9/11 museum : tragedy turns the mundane into memorial			0
