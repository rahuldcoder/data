-- as many as 225,000 children in @entity4 live and work as unpaid domestic servants , the first study to closely examine the issue concluded			1
the existence of these arrangements are not new , but the scope is larger than previously thought , a new study by the @entity8 found			0
the foundation conducted the largest field survey of human rights violations in @entity4			0
known as restaveks , these extremely poor children are sent by their families to other homes			1
" in principle , parental placement of a restavek child involves turning over child - rearing responsibility to another household in exchange for the child 's unpaid domestic service , " the study says			1
the majority , two - thirds , of restaveks are female , and all are prone to abuse and rape by their host families , the study says			1
the movement of the children is from poor homes to less poor homes , sometimes within the same family			2
in addition to boarding , families often send their children to become restaveks because of schooling opportunities in their new homes			2
to determine how widespread this practice is , the foundation conducted 1,458 door - to - door surveys in some of the more troubled neighborhoods in @entity4 , the poorest nation in the @entity52			2

the study 's aim was to answer the question : " what is the scale of the victimization ? " what researchers found was that 22 percent of children surveyed were living away from home , and that 30 percent of households had restavek children			0
using census projections for 2010 , the study extrapolated that as many as 225,000 children in @entity4 's urban areas could be living as restaveks			1
the recruitment of such children is " intimately linked " with poverty , said the study , which recommended that the government and foreign aid be used in poverty alleviation programs and more widely available education services , especially in rural areas			0
the placement of restavek children has traditionally been a movement from rural @entity4 to urban areas			0
another key find to the study is that they are increasingly coming from other urban areas , the study found			0
in many cases , children are placed in homes of relatives , but kinship ties did not guarantee better treatment , according to the study .			0
