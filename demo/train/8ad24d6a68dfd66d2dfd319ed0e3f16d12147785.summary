@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a country road in eastern @entity1 , a scene of bucolic tranquility was suddenly interrupted by the aftermath of carnage			1
a burned - out tank tilted into a ditch , its turret blown some 20 meters away by a direct hit			1
unexploded ammunition of every caliber lay everywhere			2
a troop transport vehicle was shot to pieces ; a short distance away a simple grave was marked by a cross hastily made from branches			2
amid the fields of sunflowers and grazing cows , the smell of burned metal hung in the air			2
the road , running south from @entity0 , was the escape route for @entity1 soldiers when the town finally fell to @entity31 separatists after a three - week siege			1
except that many of those soldiers , at least 70 according to army medics and probably more , did not escape			0
whether they were ambushed or killed making a final stand , or rebels reneged on a deal to grant them safe passage , is unclear			0
but their chaotic retreat marked one of the bloodiest defeats for @entity1 security forces in their war to reclaim the east			1
it was also the latest evidence of a resurgence in the fortunes of the rebels			0
after being penned back into a shrinking corner of eastern @entity1 -- around the cities of @entity54 and @entity55 -- for much of july and august , they are now advancing on several fronts			1
last week the army of @entity58 , as it now calls itself , seized @entity59 , a town on the coast a few miles from the @entity63 border			0
those fighters have begun to push west and north , while others have captured more territory south and east of the city of @entity54			0
the rebels have established a corridor from the city all the way to the coast in which there is no sign of @entity1 forces			1
in an interview with @entity2 tuesday , the youthful commander of rebel forces in @entity0 , who gave his name as @entity81 , was contemptuous of @entity1 troops , who he claimed vastly outnumbered his men			1
" i proposed to them a million times to give up and get out , " he said			0
" but many of their officers are fighting for money , and the regular soldiers are forced into it			0
they died with tears in their eyes because they have no experience , and do n't know who their enemy is			0
" asked to show the rebels ' front lines on a map of @entity1 , he leaned across the cot that takes up half his tiny office and drew a line beyond @entity106 -- and further west			1
" but you do n't control @entity106 , " we countered			0
" it is next , " he said with confidence			0
@entity106 is @entity1 's fourth - largest city with a population of more than 400,000 , an uneasy mixture of @entity117 and @entity31 viewpoints that has exploded into violence several times since the unrest began			1
it could only be occupied by a substantial force			0
but on tuesday the rebels stationed a t - 72 tank and troop carrier on the main highway just 40 miles ( 70 kilometers ) from the city			2
a nearby @entity1 checkpoint that was manned just last week is deserted			1
there is little evidence of the @entity1 army around the city ; just a few trenches , hastily dug by volunteers , on the outskirts			1
in @entity0 , @entity81 has certainly amassed an impressive store of weapons and ammunition			1
all were seized from the @entity1 , he insisted , showing us their markings			1
boxes of mortars and shells were stacked high in a garage ; outside his men were trying to repair an armored personnel carrier			0
but his forces also boasted at least two @entity150 tanks flying the flag of @entity58 -- a blue diagonal cross on a red background -- that looked virtually new			2
asked where they came from , he said he did n't really care			0
then he embraced and kissed a blonde female fighter carrying a @entity159 sniper rifle and walked off			0
nearby , almost every window in a four - story school has been shattered			2
mortar impacts have thrown up dirt and paving and demolished a wall in what was the playground			0
an anti-tank mine lay in the grass			0
in the road outside , a rocket was embedded in the tarmac ; a @entity1 flag lay twisted and dirty on the floor of a bus the troops were using			1
the school was the headquarters in @entity0 for the @entity178 detachment sent to hold the town			1
they were targeted by mortar fire of an accuracy rarely seen from separatist forces			0
so were the blackened tanks --- a dozen or more --- that lay across the road south of @entity0			1
whether the separatists have had training in @entity63 or been joined by reinforcements from across the border is at the heart of the dispute that has drawn @entity193 into its worst crisis since the @entity195			2
what is beyond dispute is that the weaponry they now have -- and their ability to use it -- is far more advanced than two or three months ago			1
but identifying who is using what hardware in this conflict , and where it came from , is at best an imprecise science			0
in a burned field south of @entity0 , on what was the frontline of combat a few days ago , we found a large green tube amid bushes and trees			1
military experts have identified it as the rocket motor section of a @entity63 - made @entity217 " ballistic missile			1
but both the @entity1 and @entity63 militaries have the @entity220			1
the same dilemma applies in identifying the separatists			2
most of the fighters at @entity81 's base appeared to be from the @entity54 area			0
further south , men manning a checkpoint near @entity229 had distinctly @entity63 accents			0
but the presence of active - duty @entity63 soldiers -- and in what numbers -- is impossible to know			1
the civilians who have remained in @entity0 , a town without water or electricity , seemed largely supportive of the new authorities			1
few had anything good to say about the @entity178 soldiers ; some villagers claimed they had harassed and stolen from locals , claims that were impossible to verify			0
one man said the separatists had shot dead his 23 - year old grandson when he was caught looting -- but at least they had helped arrange the funeral			1
in small towns and villages in this corner of @entity1 , it is increasingly rare to come across @entity253 sentiment			1
while identifying themselves as @entity1 , many people have family links to @entity63			1
they accuse the @entity1 armed forces of being undisciplined , or indiscriminate in their targeting			1
anecdotal evidence after two days in @entity54 suggests a similar feeling there			0
wherever the shelling is coming from ( and it is sporadic and seems largely indiscriminate ) , people seemed to blame the @entity1 forces surrounding the city			2
tens of thousands of people have abandoned @entity54 over the last few months , and the streets are eerily quiet			2
stores and restaurants are boarded up ; playgrounds deserted			0
most professionals have left ; most of those still in the city tend to be older and poorer , with nowhere to go			0
among them are the store - owners at a street market by the railway station , an area hit by several shells at the weekend			2
as they swept away the shattered glass and gazed at their ruined livelihoods on monday morning , one woman , on the verge of tears , said she had just brought $ 700 of clothing from @entity288 to sell			0
now it was gone in the fire ignited by the shelling			0
a grizzled middle - aged man wandered up			2
he had a unique prescription for @entity1 's troubles			2
" peace , freedom , @entity298 , " he said with a toothless grin			0

in eastern @entity1 , burned - out military vehicles , used armaments litter the *countryside*
in @entity0 , one rebel commander tells @entity2 he is confident of *victory*
@entity308 : it is increasingly rare to come across @entity253 sentiment in the small towns , villages of this region
separatists ' weaponry -- and their ability to use it -- are far more advanced than two or three months ago , says @entity308
