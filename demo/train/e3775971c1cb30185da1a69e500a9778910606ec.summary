-- @entity1 , the reporter who broke the news about secret @entity4 surveillance programs , said the authorities who took his partner into custody at @entity12 's @entity11 " are going to regret what they did			1
" " i am going to write my stories a lot more aggressively now , " the @entity14 reporter told @entity16 's @entity15 on monday in @entity17			2
" i am going to publish many more documents now			2
i am going to publish a lot about @entity22 , too , i have a lot of documents about the espionage system in @entity22			1
now my focus is going to be that as well			1
" @entity1 's partner , 28 - year - old @entity27 , was held for nearly nine hours			1
he was reportedly passing through the airport on his way home to @entity16 after leaving @entity31			1

the @entity36 knew the move was coming			1
" there was a heads up that was provided by the @entity42 government , " @entity36 spokesman @entity38 said monday			1
so the @entity4 knew it " was likely to occur , but it 's not something that we 've requested and it 's something that was done specifically by the @entity42 law enforcement officials there , " he said			1
he would not comment on whether the @entity4 has obtained material from @entity49 's laptop -- and would not say whether president @entity50 condemns the detention			1
agents asked ' about my entire life ' @entity49 , also speaking to @entity15 in @entity17 , said agents were asking him questions " about my entire life			2
" " i was in a room , there were six different agents coming in and out and talking to me , " he said			1
" they took my computer , video games , cell phone , everything			2
" the detention was reported by @entity14			2
before releasing him , authorities seized @entity49 's laptop , cell phone , video game consoles and usb sticks , @entity1 wrote for @entity14			1
" this is obviously a rather profound escalation of their attacks on the news - gathering process and journalism , " he said			0
" it 's bad enough to prosecute and imprison sources			0
it 's worse still to imprison journalists who report the truth			0
but to start detaining the family members and loved ones of journalists is simply despotic			0
even the @entity85 had ethical rules against targeting the family members of people they felt threatened by			0
" a @entity90 spokesman confirmed that a 28 - year - old man was detained sunday at @entity11			1
the spokesman said the man was held for close to nine hours under schedule 7 of the @entity94			1
' grave concern ' @entity16 's foreign ministry issued a statement sunday expressing " grave concern " over the incident			0
@entity100 had erupted in @entity16 when citizens learned of @entity102 spying on @entity16			0
" this measure is without justification since it involves an individual against whom there are no charges that can legitimate the use of that legislation			0

" @entity49 is not a @entity14 employee but often assists @entity1 in his work , " the newspaper said			1
@entity14 editor @entity127 , in an editorial , wrote that " @entity49 is not a journalist , but he still plays a valuable role in helping his partner do his journalistic work			0
" he added that @entity1 's work on the reams of material provided by @entity135 has been " immensely complicated by the certainty that it would be highly unadvisable for @entity1 ( or any other journalist ) to regard any electronic means of communication as safe			1
the @entity14 's work on the @entity135 story has involved many individuals taking a huge number of flights in order to have face - to - face meetings			2

but i do n't have a role			0
i do n't look at documents			0
i do n't even know if it was documents that i was carrying			0
it could have been for the movie that @entity120 is working on			0
" " if the @entity42 and @entity4 governments believe that tactics like this are going to deter or intimidate us in any way from continuing to report aggressively on what these documents reveal , they are beyond deluded , " said @entity1			1
" if anything , it will have only the opposite effect : to embolden us even further			0
