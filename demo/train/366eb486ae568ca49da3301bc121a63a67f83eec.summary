-- we 're in the midst of a bionic revolution , yet most of us do n't know it			1
around 220,000 people worldwide already walk around with cochlear implants -- devices worn around the ear that turn sound waves into electrical impulses shunted directly into the auditory nerve			1
tens of thousands of people have been implanted with deep brain stimulators , devices that send an electrode tunneling several inches in the brain			1
deep brain stimulators are used to control parkinson 's disease , though lately they 've also been tested -- with encouraging results -- in use against severe depression and obsessive compulsive disorder			1
the most obvious bionics are those that replace limbs			0
olympian " @entity28 " @entity28 , now awaiting trial for the alleged murder of his girlfriend , made a splash with his @entity35 carbon fiber prostheses			0
yet those are a relatively simple technology -- a curved piece of slightly springy , super-strong material			1
in the digital age , we 're seeing more sophisticated limbs			1
explore the bionic body consider the thought - controlled bionic leg that @entity45 used to climb all 103 floors of @entity48 's @entity47			1
or the nerve - controlled bionic hand that @entity52 war veteran @entity51 had attached after the loss of his original hand			1
or the even more sophisticated i - limb @entity55 , an artificial hand with five independently articulating artificial fingers			1
those limbs do n't just react mechanically to pressure			0
they actually respond to the thoughts and intentions of their owners , flexing , extending , gripping , and releasing on mental command			0
the age when prostheses were largely inert pieces of wood , metal , and plastic is passing			0
advances in microprocessors , in techniques to interface digital technology with the human nervous system , and in battery technology to allow prostheses to pack more power with less weight are turning replacement limbs into active parts of the human body			1
in some cases , they 're not even part of the body at all			2
consider the case of @entity89			0
in 1997 , @entity89 had a stroke , leaving her without control of her arms			1
@entity89 volunteered for an experimental procedure that could one day help millions of people with partial or complete paralysis			0
she let researchers implant a small device in the part of her brain responsible for motor control			1
with that device , she is able to control an external robotic arm by thinking about it			1
that , in turn , brings up an interesting question : if the arm is n't physically attached to her body , how far away could she be and still control it ? the answer is at least thousands of miles			1
in animal studies , scientists have shown that a monkey with a brain implant can control a robot arm 7,000 miles away			1
the monkey 's mental signals were sent over the internet , from @entity119 in @entity120 , to the robot arm in @entity122			0
in this day and age , distance is almost irrelevant			2
the superhuman frontier the 7,000 - mile - away prosthetic arm makes an important point : these new prostheses are n't just going to restore missing human abilities			1
they 're going to enhance our abilities , giving us powers we never had before , and augmenting other capabilities we have			2
while the current generation of prostheses is still primitive , we can already see this taking shape when a monkey moves a robotic arm on the other side of the planet just by thinking about it			2
other research is pointing to enhancements to memory and decision making			0
the hippocampus is a small , seahorse - shaped part of the brain that 's essential in forming new memories			1
if it 's damaged -- by an injury to the head , for example -- people start having difficulty forming new long - term memories			2
in the most extreme cases , this can lead to the complete inability to form new long - term memories , as in the film @entity162			2
working to find a way to repair this sort of brain damage , researchers in 2011 created a " hippocampus chip " that can replace damaged brain tissue			2
when they implanted it in rats with a damaged hippocampus , they found that not only could their chip repair damaged memory -- it could improve the rats ' ability to learn new things			0
nor is memory the end of it			0
another study , in 2012 , demonstrated that we can boost intelligence -- at least one sort -- in monkeys			2
scientists at @entity187 implanted specialized brain chips in a set of monkeys and trained those monkeys to perform a picture - matching game			1
when the implant was activated , it raised their scores by an average of 10 points on a 100 - point scale			2
the implant makes monkeys smarter			2
from disabled to super-capable both of those technologies for boosting memory and intelligence are in very early stages , in small animal studies only , and years ( or possibly decades ) away from wide use in humans			0
still , they make us wonder -- what happens when it 's possible to improve on the human body and mind ? read this : snake arms and crystal legs : amazing artificial limbs the debate has started already , of course			1
@entity28 had to fight hard for inclusion in the @entity220			0
many objected that his carbon fiber prostheses gave him a competitive advantage			0
he was able -- with the help of doctors and biomedical engineers -- to make a compelling case that his @entity35 blades did n't give him any advantage on the field			0
but how long will that be true ? how long until we have prostheses ( not to mention drugs and genetic therapies ) that make athletes better in their sports ? but the issue is much , much wider than professional sports			0
we may care passionately about the integrity of the @entity220 or professional cycling or so on , but they only directly affect a very small number of us			0
in other areas of life -- in the workforce in particular -- enhancement technology might affect all of us			0
when it 's possible to make humans smarter , sharper , and faster , how will that affect us ? will the effect be mostly positive , boosting our productivity and the rate of human innovation ? or will it be just another pressure to compete at work ? who will be able to afford these technologies ? will anyone be able to have their body , and more importantly , their brain upgraded ? or will only the rich have access to these enhancements ? we have a little while to consider these questions , but we ought to start			1
the technology will sneak its way into our lives , starting with people with disabilities , the injured , and the ill. it 'll improve their lives in ways that are unquestionably good			0
and then , one day , we 'll wake up and realize that we 're doing more than restoring lost function			0
superhuman technology is on the horizon			0
time to start thinking about what that means for us			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity288 .			1

" we 're in the midst of a bionic revolution , " says *author* @entity288
thought - controlled bionic legs and arms are already reality
brain implants allowed monkeys to control robotic arms from a distance of 7,000 miles
these advances raise moral question over who will have access to this technology
