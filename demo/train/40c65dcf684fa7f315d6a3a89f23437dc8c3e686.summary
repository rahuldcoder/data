" trust needs to be rebuilt			0
" that 's what @entity3 chancellor @entity2 firmly asserted early friday -- as she had the previous day -- in the wake of reports the @entity7 had eavesdropped on her cell phone			1
this claim and others that she and other world leaders have been spied on had " severely shaken " relationships between @entity15 and the @entity16 , the @entity3 leader said			1
" obviously , words will not be sufficient , " @entity2 said in the wee hours friday at a summit of @entity19 leaders			2
" true change is necessary			1
" talk of the @entity7 's reported spying on @entity3 and other allies dominated @entity2 's news conference in @entity26 , @entity27			1
it illustrated the anger over this story in @entity15 and the challenges facing @entity32 because of it			0
the chancellor insisted she is n't the only one concerned ; other @entity15 leaders , she said , voiced similar sentiments during the first day of the summit thursday			0
her comments echoed some she 'd made upon arriving thursday in @entity27 , when she said that discussions of " what sort of data protection do we need and what transparency is there " should now be on @entity15 leaders ' agenda			0
" we need trust , ... " she said			0
" spying among friends is never acceptable			0
" @entity3 : @entity16 might have monitored @entity2 's phone @entity16 president @entity50 understands it 's a " necessity " for change from his nation 's perspective , according to @entity2 , who spoke with the @entity16 leader on wednesday after @entity3 's government said it had information the @entity16 might have monitored her phone			1
she told @entity50 that eavesdropping among friends is " never acceptable , no matter in what situation , " she said			0
on thursday , @entity63 spokesman @entity62 repeated what he said wednesday -- that @entity50 assured @entity2 that the @entity16 is not monitoring and will not monitor her communications			1
and in a @entity69 op - ed published online thursday night , @entity50 's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser @entity66 conceded that recent " disclosures have created significant challenges in our relationships			0
" to address them , the president has ordered a " review ( of ) our surveillance capabilities , including with our foreign partners , " she wrote			1
" we want to ensure we are collecting information because we need it and not because we can , " said @entity66			0
the @entity3 allegation comes in the same week that @entity82 daily newspaper @entity81 reported claims the @entity7 intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in @entity82 over 30 days			1
and the @entity86 newspaper -- citing a document obtained from @entity16 government contractor - turned - whistleblower @entity88 -- reported thursday that the @entity7 monitored phone conversations of 35 world leaders			1
the confidential memo is from 2006 , which is before @entity50 became president			0
none of the monitored world leaders is identified			0
the phone numbers were among 200 handed over to the @entity7 by a @entity16 official , the memo states			1
others were encouraged to share their " rolodexes " with the agency , according to the document , even though tracking until then had yielded " little reportable intelligence			0
" like @entity62 , @entity7 spokeswoman @entity104 refused " to comment publicly on every specific intelligence activity			2
" " as we have made clear , " she added , " ... the @entity16 gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations			1
" @entity15 leaders push for data protection it 's not clear how well such explanations will be received by @entity32 's allies in @entity15 elsewhere , or how significantly it has and will continue to affect the @entity116 meeting			0
the two - day summit was supposed to focus on the digital economy and economic and social policy issues , as well as concerns about @entity19 migration after a recent shipwreck off an @entity124 island in which hundreds of migrants from @entity126 died			0
but @entity82 prime minister @entity127 told the @entity128 on tuesday that @entity82 would ask for the question of electronic surveillance to be added to the agenda			2
the @entity19 leaders were expected to discuss data protection issues as part of their debate on the digital economy			0
@entity136 , vice president of the @entity137 , called for @entity19 nations to commit to adopting a data protection law in light of the recent spying scandals			0
" data protection must apply to everyone -- whether we are talking about citizens ' e-mails or @entity2 's mobile phone , " she said			1
" we now need big @entity15 rules to counter big fears of surveillance			0
" at the summit today , @entity15 's heads of state and government must follow words with action : they should commit to adopting the @entity156 by spring 2014			0
this would be @entity15 's declaration of independence			0
only then can @entity15 credibly face the @entity16			2
" ' completely unacceptable ' even before the latest allegations , @entity3 and other nations had expressed concerns about alleged @entity16 spying after @entity88 -- a former @entity7 contractor -- leaked classified information about @entity16 surveillance programs			1
spy chief : reports of @entity7 logging @entity82 phone calls are false @entity3 news magazine @entity169 reported in june that leaks from @entity88 detailed how the agency bugged @entity19 offices in @entity32 and @entity173 , and conducted an " electronic eavesdropping operation " that tapped into an @entity19 building in @entity26			1
@entity2 spoke with @entity50 by phone in july about allegations that the @entity16 was conducting surveillance on its @entity15 allies			1
@entity2 made it clear that if the information about the @entity16 having monitored her phone were true , it would be " completely unacceptable , " spokesman @entity180 said of wednesday 's call with @entity50			1
a spokesman for @entity187 declined to answer questions thursday about whether the @entity191 prime minister 's phone had been tapped by the @entity16 , following @entity3 's suspicion about @entity16 monitoring of @entity2 's cell phone			1
" i am not going to comment on matters of security or intelligence , " the spokesman told reporters at a regular briefing			0
@entity127 : ' shocking ' claims @entity127 described the report of widespread spying by the @entity7 on @entity82 calls as " worrying " and " shocking , " saying that security should not be guaranteed at the price of a loss of freedom			1
report : @entity16 intercepts @entity82 phone calls on a ' massive scale ' however , @entity16 director of national intelligence @entity211 suggested that the claims made by @entity81 were false			1
the articles " contain inaccurate and misleading information regarding @entity16 foreign intelligence activities , " a written statement from his office said tuesday			2
it added that the @entity16 does gather intelligence of " the type gathered by all nations			2
" nonetheless , the allegations prompted a flurry of diplomatic activity this week between the @entity16 and @entity82			1
@entity50 and @entity82 president @entity227 spoke about the claims monday			2
" the president and president @entity227 discussed recent disclosures in the press -- some of which have distorted our activities and some of which raise legitimate questions for our friends and allies about how these capabilities are employed , " a @entity63 statement said			2
" the president made clear that the @entity16 has begun to review the way that we gather intelligence , so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share			2
" @entity227 's office said the president expressed his " deep disapproval with regard to these practices " to @entity50 and that such alleged activities would be unacceptable between allies and friends			0
the two presidents agreed that @entity82 and @entity16 intelligence services would cooperate on investigating the report , according to the statement from the @entity82 president 's office			1
@entity82 foreign minister @entity266 and @entity16 secretary of state @entity267 also met tuesday to discuss the claims			1
the @entity16 ambassador to @entity82 , @entity269 , was summoned to the @entity270 in @entity271 on monday to discuss the alleged spying			2
claims of @entity16 spying , resulting from leaks by @entity88 , have also soured @entity16 relations with @entity277 and @entity278			2
@entity169 recently published allegations , citing @entity88 as its source , that the @entity7 " systematically " eavesdropped on the @entity277 government and hacked the public e-mail account of former @entity277 president @entity283			0
@entity277 to summon @entity16 ambassador over spying allegations			0

@entity16 official : " surveillance capabilities , including with ... foreign partners " under review
@entity3 leader : " true change is necessary " on part of the @entity16
@entity16 is n't monitoring @entity2 's communications , @entity63 insists
@entity82 is angry about claims the @entity7 intercepted millions of phone calls in @entity82
