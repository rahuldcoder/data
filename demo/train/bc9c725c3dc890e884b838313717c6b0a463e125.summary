-- perhaps @entity2 ' invitation back to " @entity3 " got lost in the mail			1
the actor , who appeared on " snl " from 1991 to 2000 , initially seemed upset to see the show bring back its @entity8 sketch without him on saturday			1
written by " snl " alums @entity11 and @entity12 , the sketch revolved around guys recalling the daring feats of legendary businessman @entity8			1
at the heart of it was @entity11 who , with teeth too large and a drunken slur , would join his compatriots in toasting @entity8 's awesomeness			1
with @entity11 back on the show saturday , " snl " resurrected the sketch and tapped his " anchorman 2 " co-stars @entity25 and @entity26 , host of the night 's episode , to join him			1
most viewers were probably thrilled to see the sketch return , but @entity2 apparently was shocked			1
" they did @entity8 without me ... , " he posted on his @entity31 page			2
" not even a ' hey would you want to come to do one line and bring your kids to see ( @entity37 ) ... ? ' nothing ... wow ... i guess i know my place			0
" @entity2 said he 's " grateful for what they did for me " but it " stings a little to not even be considered as someone they would like to come back around			2
... sorry ( ' @entity44 ' ) bombed			0
... ( i ) f it would have done better they would n't treat me like a red - headed stepchild			2
" other @entity50 sketch regulars from the old days , such as @entity51 and @entity52 , were also missing in action , and @entity2 suggested the bit appeared to double as an " @entity55 " promo			1
" i 'm sure it 's economics and budget , " he said sunday morning			0
" i 'm not in ' anchorman ' and i 'm not promoting a show so who would want to pay for me to fly to @entity62			0
" later , after encouraging words from fans ( " @entity44 " may not have done well at the box office , but at least one person considers the 2000 movie a classic ) and learning the sketch was a last - minute deal , @entity2 seemed to have made peace with being left out			1
" thanks everyone for all your kind comments			0
i 'm not mad at the show , " he shared			0
" i know what it takes to produce those sketches in a short amount of time			0
i talked to a friend on the show who said it was a last - minute sketch			1
i acted like a baby			0
i 'm happy for all of my friends ' success and will always be grateful and proud to have been a part of ' snl			2
' that being said do n't forget to see ' anchorman 2 ' coming soon to a ( theater ) near you			0
