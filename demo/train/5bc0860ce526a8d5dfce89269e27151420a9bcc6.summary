at a gray church on the outskirts of @entity4 in eastern @entity5 , @entity0 from across the county keep a nervous watch			1
some stand behind the iron gate ; others sit just inside the church door			0
for more than two months they 've waited , preparing themselves to protect the cross on top of their church			1
" if i have to , i am going to hold it in my arms and protect it , " one elderly man says			0
" they have no right to tear it down , that is why we have to defend our church			0
" like many here , it 's too risky for him to give his name			0
@entity4 is known as the " @entity29 " and throughout this year the local @entity31 authorities have demolished scores of churches and forcibly removed more than 300 church crosses			1
@entity5 church leaders say it 's the worst anti-christian crackdown in decades			1
" what the government here is doing is so barbaric , they 're like bandits and we are furious with them , " says @entity37 , a respected church leader in the @entity4 area			1
" today we 've seen the fundamental symbol of our faith violated and it hurts us deep inside our hearts			0
" crackdown the local authorities are mostly targeting state - sanctioned churches , long tolerated by the ruling @entity31 and often touted as a sign of religious freedom in the officially atheist country			1
scores have been injured in the crackdown , as congregations throughout the region try to stop the government teams			0
in late july , hundreds of police tried to storm the gates of the @entity59 in @entity60 in @entity4			1
like other attempted demolitions , they moved in in the middle of the night , and scenes of extraordinary defiance unfolded on the church 's @entity67 video as club - wielding police beat their way in			1
they appear to lose their resolve when an older man is rushed away by ambulance			0
a blow to the head fractured his skull , say church activists			0
but several weeks later , they came back with reinforcements and tore down the cross			0
it now lies under a cheap plastic shroud at the foot of the church 's stairs			1
" they wanted to drag it away , " says a church caretaker who would n't give his name			0
now it is too big for us to move			0
" illegal structures ? the local government denies the crackdown on @entity96			1
they say the demolitions are part of a broader campaign to target illegal structures in the province			1
they say church demolitions represent only a tiny fraction of their work			2
but leaked party documents single out churches and folk religious sites in the so - called " three rectifications and one demolition " campaign			2
and church leaders like @entity37 say that the demolition campaign is merely a front for a crackdown to curtail @entity96 's influence in the region			1
church leaders say that the central government has ignored all their complaints and petitions			1
they fear that the @entity4 demolitions could be a test case for the party , an opening salvo in what could become a wider national campaign			1
" the leaders think @entity96 is a foreign religion and it is part of a foreign culture , which they define as ' western ' culture , " says @entity37			2
" they see our growth as an invasion of western culture into @entity5			2
" since chairman @entity139 's death in 1976 , @entity96 has taken hold in @entity5			1
though it is still a minority religion			0
" @entity96 has been growing very rapidly in @entity5 in the last several decades , " says @entity143 of @entity144 in @entity145			1
" there is very little sign that it is slowing down			0
" " it moved from a largely rural religion , came into the cities and became very popular with entrepreneurs			0
many converts are now the youth			0
" he estimates that in a few years @entity5 will have more christians than @entity31 members , which stood at more than 85 million in the last count			2
and in just 15 years , @entity5 could overtake the @entity158 as the country with largest @entity0 population in the world			1
@entity5 state media have disputed those claims			2
' social glue ' back at the gray church , the @entity0 have managed to keep the demolition crews away for now			1
their striking red cross sits above the church 's spire			1
they often sing hymns to steel their resolve			0
" @entity174 " by a @entity176 composer has become a rallying cry in @entity4			2
the congregation do n't look like typical @entity5 activists			2
there are elderly faithful with their grandchildren , wealthy - looking businessmen and clean - cut students			0
@entity37 says , far from hurting the party , @entity96 has been a refuge and social glue for many @entity5 as income gaps rise and @entity5 look for meaning			2
" we help promote social harmony , " he says			0
but @entity37 has a warning			0
" if they keep doing things this way , there is a saying ' those who play with fire will get burned , ' " he says .			0
