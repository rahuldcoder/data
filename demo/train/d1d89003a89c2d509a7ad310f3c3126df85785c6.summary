-- with @entity2 , a new quest to cure death and driverless cars , it can be easy to forget what @entity6 's primary business is : search			1
the largest search engine in the world is getting a few updates , the company announced on thursday			1
@entity6 tied the news to its 15th birthday and held the announcement in the original @entity16			1
the overall design has been updated and borrows the " card " look from @entity19 , lumping relevant information into rectangles and carousels and placing it above any links to websites			2
answers will now be " richer " and include comparisons , filters and sorting			0
for example , if you ask @entity6 to compare two foods , it will return a chart of their nutritional values			1
there are new results for song and music searches , and push notifications will soon come to the @entity42 app. the company is continuing to focus heavily on voice search , improving its conversational skills on the @entity46 and in search apps			1
" we believe that voice will be fundamental to building interactions with future devices that we will see , " said @entity48 , @entity6 's senior vice president of search			1
devices such as smartwatches and @entity2 forgo traditional input devices in favor of voice interactions			0
no corporate birthday party is complete without a trip down memory lane and balloons and birthday cake , both of which were also present at the event			2
in september 1998 , @entity6 founders @entity66 and @entity67 started their company in @entity71 's home garage in @entity72			1
the space remains largely unchanged and still has the same sky blue carpet @entity71 had installed as a perk to persuade @entity67 and page to rent the space			0
@entity71 , now a senior vice president at @entity6 , kicked off the event			1
" even though a lot of thing are different at @entity6 , the core is still the same , " she said , citing the company 's commitment to improving search , being a global company and thinking big			1
the original @entity6 was indexing pages on the @entity88 , returning links to 10 web pages that had a high probability of containing information that matched a query			2
the system was imperfect , easily flummoxed by synonyms , misspelled words and sites that gamed the system			0
over the years , @entity6 has launched various changes to the search engine to improve results			1
it added spell check , grasped the concept of synonyms and rolled out auto - complete			0
in 2007 , it moved on from just links and started including other types of relevant content such as images , news articles and maps as part of its " universal search			0
" a subtle update happened in 2010			0
@entity116 shaved fractions of seconds off each @entity6 search by predicting your search terms as you type them			1
" @entity6 gives me back an hour of my life every month , " said @entity48 of @entity116			2
" that 's not small , that 's huge			0
" more recent changes have focused on how @entity6 understands information			2
the @entity126 debuted in 2012 and connects search terms with real objects , places and people			0
now the company is indexing information			0
instead of the top 10 pages about @entity135 , you will get information on the painter directly from @entity6 at the top of your search results , including background , images of famous paintings and related artists			1
people who use @entity6 might not notice one of the bigger changes			2
the company has updated its under - the - hood search algorithms to something called " @entity150 , " which will affect 90 % of searches worldwide			2
the changes will make a difference in how results are ranked			0
" finding relationships between concepts is a very , very hard problem			0
and you have to balance the meaning of what that query is looking for with what the document is saying , " said @entity48 .			0
