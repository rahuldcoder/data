-- dear @entity1 , there are more than 7 billion people in the world			1
half of them are women and girls			1
just imagine the whole world rising , as it will , when all women and girls are empowered			1
it has to start with education			1
all the number crunchers have it right on this one : education = empowerment , from here in the @entity17 to @entity18 and @entity19			1
the @entity20 , the @entity21 and any organization you can think of say that an educated girl is a girl who can get a job , become a breadwinner and raise herself , her family , her village , her community and eventually her whole country			0
all the stories and statistics show that a healthy society is one whose women are healthy and productive			0
look at what women and girls are achieving for @entity38 , 19 years after the genocide there			1
the country leads the way in @entity42 in every way : education , health , the economy , the environment and in elected politics , powered by the force of its women			1
it is an amazing story			0
in contrast , the @entity54 world , which is so rich in natural resources such as oil and gas , is way behind in all development indicators , because half their populations , their women , are denied basic rights			1
it 's why the @entity65 must liberate and fully empower women , for the good of those countries			0
write your own open letter to girls of the world did you know that if female employment were to match male employment in the @entity17 , gross domestic product would rise by 5 %			1
and in developing countries that figure soars by double digits -- for instance , gdp would rise 34 % in @entity80 if women and men had equal employment opportunities			0
and this is where education comes in			2
according to a 2004 report co-authored by @entity89 ( now a senior economic aide to president @entity91 ) , a woman can expect a 10 % to 20 % rise in earning power with every additional year of primary education beyond average			2
another economist , @entity96 , found that number increased to 15 % to 25 % higher earning power with each additional year of secondary school			2
so educate our girls if you want to reduce infant mortality , stabilize population growth and reduce cases of hiv / aids			2
in rural areas , the @entity20 says wages , agriculture income and productivity all improve when the female workers are educated			0
it is time to end the discrimination against girls in education			1
according to the @entity20 , around 35 million girls are not enrolled in primary school and that has to end			2
almost 800 million people worldwide are illiterate ; two - thirds of them are women and girls			2
imagine a world where they could actually read and write and do basic math for accounting -- that is how the world will change			0
women are much more likely than men to use their earnings for the good of the family , rather than spending it on alcohol or other things for themselves			0
just ask the great microfinance pioneer @entity137 of @entity139 's @entity138 -- women are the best bet			0
you lend them a little , and they pay back in spades			0
he has known this for 30 years			0
it 's high time the rest of the world caught on			0
go girls ! power the world ! we can do it			1
