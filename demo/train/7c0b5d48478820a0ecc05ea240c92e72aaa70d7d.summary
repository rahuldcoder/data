-- @entity2 could dead - lift a washing machine and carry it across the street			1
he could swim miles on end and run a marathon on one day 's notice			2
the former @entity8 stayed in top shape because his life -- and the lives of his teammates -- depended on it			1
but when his physical strength deteriorated in a fight against cancer , @entity2 had to rely on his mental fortitude to carry him through four years of excruciating pain , a bone marrow transplant and two collapsed lungs			1
finally back on his feet , @entity2 now has a new mission			1
he 's relearning to run , one step at a time , in honor of the 19 - year - old boy who saved his life			1
newlywed nightmare the pain started in his ribs			2
@entity2 brushed it off , figuring a martial arts fight had gotten the best of him			1
he and his new wife , @entity32 , were enjoying their first few months of marital bliss in @entity35			2
he was rebuilding their house -- the one that @entity39 had destroyed -- in between training at a military base in @entity42			2
but the pain persisted and his workouts soon started to suffer			2
" for me it was pretty easy to run 10 , 15 miles , " @entity2 says			1
" suddenly i could n't run five			2
i got to three and my legs just ground to a halt			2
" in june 2006 , shortly before his 28th birthday , @entity2 's doctor called and told him that his white blood cell count was elevated			1
the military sent @entity2 to the @entity52 in @entity53 , @entity54 , to get checked out			1
the diagnosis : acute lymphoblastic leukemia			1
" my first question was , ' can i still be a seal ? ' " @entity2 remembers			1
still in shock , @entity32 was ticked off : " not ' my new bride ' or ' what 's our new life going to be like ? ' but ' am i going to be able to roll in the dirt with my friends and blow up things ? ' my whole world in front of me just went black			2
" doctors immediately started @entity70 on eight straight days of chemotherapy			2
the drugs had no mercy -- attacking healthy and unhealthy cells alike , weakening his entire body			2
" they tell you to take your iv pole and walk a lap around the floor each day to avoid clots , " @entity2 says			1
" i remember leaning on that iv pole , just draping my arms over top of it just to get around the ward once			2
" that did n't stop him from doing lunges in the hospital library , using books as weights			2
in addition to leukemia , doctors discovered @entity2 had the @entity96 , an abnormality in his genes that caused cancerous cells to duplicate 80 times faster than in other patients			1
chemotherapy was n't going to be enough ; he needed a bone marrow transplant			1
husband walks streets in search of kidney donor attacked from within like many @entity8 , @entity2 is a little " twisted , " @entity32 says			1
" if you tell him , ' there 's a very low chance that you 'll get through this , ' well , he knows he can			2
if you tell him , ' you ca n't , ' he loves to prove you wrong			2
that 's the little cherry on top for him			0
" she believes that attitude saved him			0
@entity2 developed graft - versus - host disease shortly after receiving a bone marrow transplant from a @entity121 donor			1
with graft - vs. - host disease , the new cells attack the recipient 's body because they see it as a foreign entity			2
" for the first two months i was throwing up every day because my stomach was getting beat up so bad , " @entity2 says			1
he also developed a severe skin condition			0
anytime he got warm , hives would break out all over his body			0
for months , @entity2 worked out with a mouth guard so he could get through the pain without screaming			1
in 2007 , @entity2 went back to work and rejoined the @entity8 as a platoon commander			1
he knew his struggle was n't over , but he was managing the disease			0
managing it , that is , until a doctor made a mistake with his medication , causing his symptoms to flare up again			0
his hands and feet itched like crazy			0
a mouth full of sores caused any crunchy food to hurt like a razor blade			0
cause for more concern was his liver and lungs , which were failing rapidly			0
by february 2009 , it had gotten so bad that he had to resign from his seal team			0
" that crushed me , " he says			0
" that was everything i had worked for since i was 14 or 15 years old			0
" and the worst was yet to come			0
" i remember the day my lungs collapsed			0
i remember them putting me on a gurney , calling a code blue , rushing me through the hospital			0
" @entity2 slipped into a coma			1
" the doctors told me how sick he was , how close to death he was , " @entity32 says			0
" i was just thinking ... there is no way @entity168 can die like this			0
he will be so po - ed. " after two weeks , @entity2 awakened from his coma			1
for a while , his body seemed ok , but doctors were worried about his chest scans			0
after everything he had been through , the news that he would need a double lung transplant barely fazed him			1
" @entity178 was n't an option , " @entity2 says			1
" in my mind , i 've always thought that i have the ability to prevent this from happening			0
i have the ability to fight it off			0
" he had the operation on july 22 , 2010			0
back on his feet just eight months after his transplant , @entity2 completed a half marathon			1
in september 2012 , he half - ran , half - walked his second			1
working with @entity189 , a fundraising program with the @entity191 , @entity2 has collected more than $ 39,000 this year for cancer research			1
he hopes to raise another $ 11,000 by running the @entity194 half marathon in november			1
if he reaches his fundraising goal before the end of the year , he 'll be allowed to name a research project after his lung donor , 19 - year - old @entity199			1
" @entity199 abruptly ended his life on july 20 , 2010 , without knowing what an incredible person he was , " his mother , @entity200 , told @entity0 in an e-mail			0
" @entity199 died believing that he did n't matter , that no one would remember his name ... @entity168 and @entity199 are now joined together -- a brotherhood -- on a mission to help others			0
they endure training together , go on adventures together			0
my son still lives and breathes			0
" @entity2 hopes to meet @entity200 in @entity215 after the november race			1
he is reminded every day that he would n't be alive if it were n't for her son			0
follow @entity2 's journey on @entity221 donate to his cause @entity2 still struggles to do simple tasks , like mow the lawn or climb stairs			1
most lung transplant patients die from complications within five years , a statistic that 's always in the back of @entity32 's mind			1
" i constantly ask him , ' are you ok ? are you breathing ? ' that drives him crazy , " she says with a laugh			0
" ( but ) if there 's one person that can live for 25 years with a new set of lungs , it 's going to be him			0
" for now , the couple is focusing on taking things one step at a time -- all the way to the finish line			0
@entity2 strives to follow his seal team 's motto : @entity251			1
" you must do something to improve yourself each day , " he wrote on his blog			0
" that does n't mean just doing what is required			0
that means stretch your limits a little bit farther than the day before			0
" for team in @entity262 , the race is n't about running			2
