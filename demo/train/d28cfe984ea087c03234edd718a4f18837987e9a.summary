-- @entity1 has played down comments made by @entity4 golfing legend @entity3 that his emergence as the world 's most dominant golfer is intimidating @entity8			1
@entity3 's comments have led to @entity8 jokingly referring to the @entity10 as " @entity11 , " says @entity1			1
but it 's a nickname he neither deserves , nor takes seriously , he says			2
" no. how can i intimidate @entity8 ? i mean , the guy 's got 75 or whatever @entity14 wins , 14 majors			1
he 's been the biggest thing ever in our sport , " he added			2
" how could some little 23 - year - old from @entity21 with a few wins come up and intimidate him			0
it 's just not possible			2
i do n't know where he got that from , but it 's not true , " he added			2
but @entity3 , a two - time major winner , believes a changing of the golfing guard is underway			1
" when have you ever seen him intimidated by another player ? never			2
i think [ @entity8 ] knows his time 's up and that 's normal ; these things tend to go in 15 - year cycles , " @entity3 told @entity34			1
woods and @entity1 have been paired together in the opening round of the @entity41 -- the final playoff in this year 's @entity43 -- which starts at @entity44 , @entity45 on thursday			1
@entity1 will guarantee himself $ 10 million if he wins the tournament and has a good chance of taking the prize with a top - five finish , according to @entity50			1
@entity51 winning scenarios victory in the @entity41 would also see @entity1 complete four wins from his five most recent tournaments on the @entity14 -- a sequence which began at the @entity57			1
" it would just cap off a great year , " @entity1 said			1
" it 's hard to compare [ the playoffs ] to a major championship because it 's a year -- long thing and it 's about being consistent			0
" you have to play well at the right time like i have the last couple of weeks			0
it would be nice to have something to recognise that you have played the best golf the whole way throughout the year			0
" " if i win [ the @entity41 ] , i win [ the @entity43 ] , " he said			1
" that 's the mindset i 'm coming in with			1
i feel like i 'm playing well enough to win			0
i know if i do that , everything else takes care of itself			0
" meanwhile , @entity1 has revealed he will reconsider his decision to compete for @entity77 at the 2016 @entity78 in @entity79			2
@entity80 , who was born in @entity21 , received funding from the @entity82 before turning professional in 2007			0
his comments that he would rather represent @entity77 were criticized in some quarters , but @entity1 says he will make a decision nearer the time			1
" after everything that happened last week it definitely makes me reconsider my position and reconsider a lot of things , " he added			0
" i think it just really hit home with me how important it is for a lot of people and how important my success has been to them			0
" " obviously , i 've had a lot of support from all sides - from people that call themselves @entity21 , from @entity21 , to the whole of the @entity104 , to people over here in the @entity107			0
" it just hit home with me at how my success is welcomed by everyone			0
it would be terrible for me to nearly segregate myself from one of those group that supports me so much			0
" it 's four years away - i still have a bit of time to decide			2
but , i 'm very , very appreciative and very grateful of the support that i get from everyone			0
