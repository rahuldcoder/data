@entity0 -- it 's a life experience nobody would want to endure -- attending your child 's funeral			1
but that 's what some parents have had to do in @entity10 in recent days , as the country 's anti-government unrest has taken an increasingly ugly , more violent turn with children killed or injured , their tiny bodies maimed and turned lifeless by shrapnel or gunshots			1
a six - year - old - girl , a four - year - old boy and a woman of about 40 died when a grenade detonated at an anti-government rally outside a shopping mall in the @entity25 area of @entity0			1
a five - year - old girl was killed by a stray bullet when attackers opened fire on an anti-government demonstration in eastern @entity32 province			1
the two youngsters in the capital were siblings , the children of a working - class family			1
the father , @entity37 , works as a personal assistant and driver -- he told me he spent every single night with his children and would never leave them alone			1
in one of the photographs at his children 's funeral , the little girl , nicknamed by her family as " cake , " ( the brother was known as " @entity50 " ) is wearing a t - shirt that says " i love @entity52			1
" " she asked me to buy it for her to wear on @entity58 , " he told me , tears rolling down his face			0
special day out the day they were caught in the attack was a special day out because their aunt was visiting from out of town			2
she had brought cake , @entity50 and her son out for a treat to the local shopping mall			1
they were waiting for a tuk - tuk -- a rickshaw taxi -- when a grenade was thrown into the crowds close to an anti-government rally outside the mall			1
@entity75 and @entity50 died from their injuries			0
their cousin , who is 8 - years old , is in critical condition in a hospital			0
we found his small , blood - drenched baseball cap at the scene			0
i have been covering the @entity10 unrest story from various protest sites , especially outside government buildings , but this time it was at the funeral of two young children			1
as we looked on and filmed , i questioned if we should be there -- if we should be filming their grief			0
but the family invited the cameras in			0
they did n't stop us and all spoke to my team			0
despite my moment of doubt , i knew this was an important aspect of this whole story that needs to be shown to those involved			0
as @entity37 so clearly put it : " my kids were just children , sweet children			2
they were too young , they should not have done this to them ... they were just innocent children , they had nothing to do with this ( political issue )			1
" what 's behind the @entity10 unrest ? their mother seated towards the back , was unable to bring herself to lift her head , wipe away her tears or talk to those sitting beside her			1
i watched as she was helped to her feet by family members , helping her take each shaky step towards her children 's bodies			2
" these are not my children , " she cried			2
" they do n't look like that			0
" children 's bodies her children were laid out with their bodies bandaged and stitched together , their faces without expression , without the joy and happiness their father described to me			1
" they were happy , innocent and sensitive kids , " said @entity37			2
" they loved to be around us -- their mum and dad all the time			0
" this was a @entity147 ceremony			0
during the last rites , family members pour water through the person 's hands to symbolize the return of the body to the elements			0
but these hands were far too tiny , far too angelic , delicate and innocent to be there			2
i watched as the mother struggled to perform the ceremony			0
she could n't look at their faces -- she would n't look -- unable to accept or bear the burden of this loss			0
even the @entity147 monk appeared lost for words as he looked on			0
i have been told that @entity147 funerals in @entity10 are often somber events , with little emotion and outward shows of grief			1
but the passing of two innocent children in such circumstances was too much for all in attendance			1
family members and friends were so distraught they could not utter words of condolence or comfort to ease the mother and father 's pain			2
and when the father came to perform the rituals -- he dropped to his knees , talking to his children			1
crying out in disbelief : " you were too young to die			0
" in this corner of the capital , at least one family had paid too high a price for the political turmoil sweeping across the country .			2
