-- @entity1 is a busy man , what with budget negotiations , gun control issues , international crises and the ever - present back - and - forth political foolery of @entity7			1
so why should he send out tweets on @entity9 ? according to an article on the @entity11 , he does n't anymore			1
" all of the president 's named social media accounts have been handed over to a non-partisan , not - for - profit group that is n't overly concerned if you did n't notice the transition , " @entity12 wrote in the article , published monday			1
some of this is , of course , @entity7 hairsplitting			0
though @ @entity1 has existed since his candidate days in 2007 , most of the posts have been handled by his staff			2
( occasionally , the president has posted something himself , tweets denoted by his " - bo " signature in the tweet			0
) the account , which has 29 million followers , has now been handed over to @entity32 , an offshoot of the president 's 2012 campaign operation			1
it 's as if , @entity12 wrote , " the president , mid-conversation , handed his phone to a telemarketer who does a great @entity1 impression			1
or , to be more accurate , one telemarketer -- the campaign -- handed the phone to another one			2
" there are legal issues involved -- the presidential campaign was set up according to one set of guidelines , and @entity32 functions under another -- but there 's a larger ethical point as well : should we believe that tweets are actually coming from the person who owns the @entity9 account ? after all , even though @entity9 takes pains to classify some accounts as " verified " -- a service they do proactively , according to the @entity9 website -- who knows who 's really on the other end ? it 's an old @entity68 conundrum , best described by the classic @entity70 cartoon caption : " on the internet , nobody knows you 're a dog			1
" transparency is best @entity75 , a journalism professor at @entity76 in @entity77 , puts it simply : honesty -- or , at least , transparency -- is the best policy			2
" if you 're transparent you 're off the hook , " he says			0
if the @entity1 administration is up front that the account has been farmed out , then it 's up to the public to decide if they want to follow @ @entity1			1
however , @entity89 , director of the @entity90 at the @entity91 , adds that it 's " reasonable to assume " that the views of @ @entity1 are those of the president , and not some affiliated activist group			1
" we 'd presume that the message is ' from him ' in the sense that someone discussed / cleared with him the kind of content that would be communicated through that channel , " he says			0
it 's " much like the @entity106 press secretary : that person speaks on behalf of the @entity106			2
" it can be difficult to tell whether the real person or some pr rep is behind the @entity9 account of some public figures			1
all @entity9 offers is their " verified " symbol			2
but judging by their tone , some of the most popular feeds appear to come straight from the mouths of the famous , including @entity118 ( @ shaq ) , @entity119 ( @ lenadunham ) and @entity120 ( @ @entity121 )			0
of course , @entity9 transparency comes at many levels			2
many public figures ' accounts have millions of followers , and followers can be purchased inexpensively if someone wants to run up the numbers			1
other accounts are " bots " -- computer - generated -- inactive , or downright fake			2
celebrities have been slammed for these practices , and some accusations of @entity138 fakery flew during last year 's presidential campaign			2
pranksters have also spoofed many well - known @entity9 accounts			1
over the weekend , megachurch pastor @entity142 was the victim of an elaborate hoax that included a fake website , phony headlines and sham @entity9 account , all maintaining he had renounced his faith			1
@entity142 's staff actually responded to the hoax on his real @entity9 account			1
@entity9 allows parody accounts , as long as the joke is clear			1
but @entity9 's impersonation policy states that " accounts portraying another person in a confusing or deceptive manner may be permanently suspended			1
" ' you never really know who you 're dealing with ' it 's yet another sign that the @entity68 remains the @entity160 , despite moves to civilize it			0
in 1992 , the @entity163 , a @entity7 - based public policy organization , actually released a " @entity164 , " many of which lend themselves to @entity9 users			1
among them : " thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people , " " thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness " and " thou shalt always use a computer in ways that insure consideration and respect for your fellow humans			0
" however , like the 1.0 version handed down to @entity179 on @entity180 , they 've been frequently abused			0
which is why , cautions @entity75 , it always pays to be skeptical			0
" we live in ( an @entity68 ) world that 's both instantaneous and a mirage , " he says			0
" you never really know who you 're dealing with			0
" perhaps another president should take heed			0
in an interview that aired monday night , @entity191 convinced @entity193 to take up @entity194			0
the 42nd president 's handle ? " @entity197			0
" ( " president @entity193 " and " @entity193 " were taken , @entity191 maintained			0
) @entity191 helped @entity193 dictate his first tweet to the account , which already has more than 60,000 followers			2
but since then , three other tweets , humorous posts on @entity203 and " @entity204 , " have been published -- and deleted			0
watch your back , mr. president .			0

@entity1 's @entity9 account is now *overseen* by @entity210
@entity9 verifies accounts of public figures , but it 's hard to know for sure who 's tweeting
accounts can be *padded* with followers -- and spoofed by pranksters
