-- @entity1 missed the halfway cut for the first time in his career after failing to shine at the rain - delayed @entity5			1
@entity1 recorded rounds of 73 and 74 , leaving him three shots off the cut mark after enduring troubles with his putter			1
but the @entity11 , who is still seeking his first @entity13 title , is confident he will be back on form for the @entity15 at @entity16 next month			2
" i 've got a couple of weeks off to get ready for @entity16 and i 'll obviously be very diligent in my preparation , " @entity1 told reporters			1
" i would have loved to go back home in form , but in golf you just never know			2
we 've seen it many times before when people go into tournaments with very little form and win , including majors			0
so you just have to keep plugging away and hope it 's your turn			2
" the greens here are very different from what i play on			0
they are a little slower than what i 'm used to and i just did n't adjust or adapt to them			0
" i just could n't read them for the life of me			0
i 'd think it was right to left and it went the other way			0
i got @entity43 ( his caddie ) to read a few too and we were seeing the same things			0
" tee to green i was n't that far off			0
but it 's the first time i 've missed the cut in a regular @entity51 event since i 've been a pro. " so i 'm very disappointed for myself and disappointed for the fans who have come out to watch me			1
" at the top of the leaderboard , @entity54 's @entity53 currently heads the field by one shot from @entity60 's @entity59			1
but with the rain playing havoc with the playing schedule , organizers announced that play would begin early sunday with the tournament reduced to 54 - holes			1
tournament director @entity68 told the @entity51 website : " we 've had another very large storm this afternoon , so suspended play for the day and after further discussions with our major sponsor @entity74 the tournament has been reduced to 54 holes			1
" we want to wrap it all up with the crowd and everyone here tomorrow			0
