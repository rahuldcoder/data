-- as @entity2 , then 21 , was driving home from college last year into the southeast @entity6 city of @entity7 , he was focused more on texting a friend than he was on the road			1
" i need to stop before i have a wreck and kill myself " was the message he sent shortly before his truck tumbled down a 20 - foot ravine , his father said			1
@entity15 , 57 , got a call at @entity17 , where he works , and thus began what turned into a months - long , multimillion - dollar recuperation for his son			2
at the hospital , he ran into a friend 's daughter , a nurse			2
" i told her , ' i do n't know what to do , ' and she said , ' you pray			2
his son had suffered a compound broken leg , broken ankles , broken ribs , a punctured lung , a broken sternum , a broken neck , a broken nose , crushed eye sockets , a crushed forehead and a fractured skull , @entity2 said			2
" they told us he would n't make it , they said he 'd be blind , he 'd never walk again			2
" after more than three weeks in a coma , @entity2 regained consciousness but initially recognized neither of his parents , @entity2 said			2
@entity2 knows that many parents of young drivers are not so lucky			1
that was underscored by three crashes in three days this week in which 15 teenagers were killed			2
in @entity54 , four @entity53 - area teenagers died tuesday morning when their car plunged into a creek			2
they were students at @entity58 , the school superintendent said			0
in @entity60 on sunday , a sport utility vehicle veered off a two - lane road into a pond , killing six of eight teenage occupants			0
the vehicle was meant to carry five people			0
in @entity6 , an suv carrying five teenagers collided with a gas tanker sunday			1
all five young people were killed , and the tanker driver was seriously injured			1
the teen driver failed to stop at a stop sign , authorities said			1
for survivors , recovery can be long			0
with such severe injuries , @entity2 was hospitalized for seven months			0
now , the 22 - year - old man has plastic eye sockets , metal rods in his legs and a rebuilt nose			1
" he 's a little bit slower than he was " but is working on a ranch , attending online classes from home and planning to take his message of survival to high schools around the state , @entity15 said			0
it 's a message the father supports			0
" i do n't want no parent to ever go through this , " he said			0
" you got ta know , my son is everything to me			0
" 6 teens killed , 2 injured when overcrowded suv flips into pond teen tragedy : 5 die in fiery collision with tanker truck in @entity6 though traffic fatalities have seen a historic drop in recent decades , young drivers remain at highest risk			1
motor - vehicle crashes are the top cause of death for people ages 15 to 20 , according to 2007 figures from the @entity112			0
in 2010 , crashes killed about 2,700 people ages 16 to 19 -- more than seven per day -- and resulted in nearly 282,000 others being treated for injuries , according to the @entity117			1
and drivers ages 16 to 19 are three times more likely than older drivers to be involved in a fatal crash , the agency says			1
the weekend crashes in @entity60 and @entity6 fit even higher - risk profiles : -- both suvs were packed with other teenagers , which in itself is a risk factor			1
the more teenage passengers , the more likely a crash will occur			0
-- none of the six teens who died in the @entity60 wreck was wearing a seat belt			1
in 2011 , 54 % of high school students said they always wore seat belts , the lowest rate of any age group , according to the @entity117			1
-- failure to focus on the task at hand also may have played a role with the 19 - year - old driver in @entity60			1
" the lady driving was playing around when she was driving , " said @entity144 , one of the two survivors of the crash , according to his account in the traffic crash report			1
" she was swaying and speeding			0
i think she was driving on purpose like that but i 'm not sure why			1
it felt like she was driving like 80 mph			2
" teen drivers are more likely than their older counterparts to speed , the @entity117 says			1
-- the @entity6 driver 's age -- 16 -- put him and his passengers at heightened risk			1
accidents are more likely to occur during the first few months after a teenager has received a driver 's license			0
-- the @entity6 driver was male : in 2010 , the death rate for male drivers and passengers ages 16 to 19 was nearly twice that of females			1
-- both wrecks occurred on the weekend : more than half ( 55 % ) of teen deaths from motor - vehicle crashes occur on friday , saturday or sunday , the @entity117 says			1
@entity6 holds a dubious distinction related to crashes			1
according to the @entity178 , young drivers were involved in 187 fatal crashes in 2010 in the @entity6 ; the next highest number was 113 , in @entity181			1
still , the trend for younger drivers -- as with drivers overall -- is toward safety			1
the 1,963 drivers ages 15 to 20 who died in motor - vehicle crashes in 2010 represented a 46 % drop from the 3,617 who died in 2001 , according to @entity178			2
there are proven ways to limit the carnage , according to the @entity117			1
it cites graduated driver licensing systems in which teens ' abilities to drive are expanded over time from the initial stages , when driving is restricted to low - risk conditions			1
some parents are equipping their vehicles with tracking technology , which they can use to monitor their children 's driving habits in real time			2
" parents are very nervous , " @entity205 , a spokesman for @entity206 , said in a telephone interview			0
" our agents hear it every day			0
putting a 16 - year - old behind the wheel on their own is a very frightening thing for a parent			0
" the company offers parents the option of installing a webcam on the rear - view mirror of the car used by new drivers			2
the camera records what happens inside and outside the vehicle but saves the recording only when it senses a sudden movement such as hard braking or a sharp turn , @entity205 said			0
the video is provided to the parents on a secure website , the equivalent of a driving report card for their kids , he said			2
" they can sit and review what happened in that incident and use it as a learning tool , " said @entity205			0
he noted that the service is free for a year , and the insurance company is not privy to the information collected			0
@entity205 credited the program for reducing risky driving behavior and said teens tend to embrace the technology after using it			2
" they develop trust with their parents , become better drivers and get more driving privileges			1
" @entity254 , director of technology research at @entity256 , noted that the insurer set up a website last fall to aid beginning drivers and their parents			2
one of its programs -- road aware -- helps drivers learn to recognize and anticipate road hazards in front of a video screen rather than on the road			1
" this is not a skill that 's automatic , " @entity254 said in a telephone interview			0
" it has to be learned			0
" forty - three percent of teen driver crashes are due to a failure to recognize hazards , she said			0
in another example of help from technology , a teenager can activate an app on his or her cellular phone and then put it in their vehicle 's cupholder , where it will score the driver 's abilities based on acceleration , cornering and braking , she said			0
" it gives you feedback on the drive you just took and allows you to score it , " she said			0
@entity2 's near - fatal texting is common , according to @entity117 statistics			1
in 2009 , distracted driving was linked to more than 5,400 deaths and about 448,000 injuries			1
cell phone use was cited as the major distraction in nearly 1,000 of the deaths and 24,000 injuries			0
nine percent of @entity306 drivers said they texted or e-mailed " regularly or fairly often " while driving			1
not all of those messages may be worth sending			0
" it was just a curve coming into town , " @entity15 said			0
" and he never curved			0
if the creek would have had water in it , he would have drowned			0
" three of my buddies seen it happen ; they went to him and they drug him out of the truck and the truck was on fire and it blew up as soon as they got him out , " he said .			0

" i need to stop before i have a wreck , " @entity6 man , 21 , texted shortly before a serious wreck
traffic fatalities have dropped , but young drivers remain at highest risk , studies show
distracted driving -- *including* texting -- is more common , @entity117 says
