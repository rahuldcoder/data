@entity21 , @entity22 : on @entity24 , online , on @entity25 ; here , there and everywhere , this is @entity0 ! thank you for spending part of your thursday with us			2
from the @entity31 , i 'm @entity32			2
first up : health care address @entity35 : first up , health care reform reclaims the spotlight as president @entity38 takes up the issue in a speech to @entity41			1
this debate has been heating up for months , with politicians and citizens weighing in with their opinions			1
it 's an incredibly complicated issue , so we 're gon na look at some of the main points right now			2
some people think the country 's health care system is fine the way it is			1
others think it 's broken , but what they do n't agree on is how to fix it			2
for example , how much would it cost to reform the system , and where would that money come from ? should there be a government - run health insurance program ? and if so , how might that impact private insurance companies ? those are just a few of the questions facing lawmakers			1
president @entity38 says he is n't the first president to take on health care , but he hopes to be the last			1
he 's been pushing for reform since he took office , and he believes the time for action is now			1
@entity6 president @entity38 : the time for bickering is over			1
the time for games has passed			2
now is the season for action			2
now is when we must bring the best ideas of both parties together and show the @entity6 people that we can still do what we were sent here to do			1
now is the time to deliver on health care			1
@entity92 @entity35 : after the president wrapped up his address to @entity41 , the @entity93 offered a response from @entity6 representative @entity97			1
the @entity99 representative , who has more than 20 years of experience as a surgeon , says he agrees with parts of president @entity38 's plan			2
but he thinks it also presents several problems			2
last night , he outlined some alternative ideas about how to improve the health care system and how to lower its costs			1
@entity110 @entity109 , ( r ) @entity99 : we need to establish tough liability reform standards , encourage speedy resolution of claims , and deter junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of care			1
real reform must do this			1
let 's also talk about letting families and businesses buy insurance across state lines			2
i and many other republicans believe that that will provide real choice and competition to lower the cost of health insurance			1
@entity132 @entity133 , @entity22 : time for the shoutout ! @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 are all members of what governmental body ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity41 , b ) the @entity6 @entity149 , c ) president @entity38 's @entity147 or @entity148 ) the @entity146 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! along with six other justices , these people compose the @entity6 @entity149			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! campaign finance @entity35 : it 's their job to interpret our country 's laws , and one case the justices are looking at right now could have a major impact on elections , including the ones coming up next year ! it 's all about how much money corporations can give to candidates			1
right now , there 's a limit on that , but some people argue that violates the @entity173			2
@entity174 is on the case			1
( @entity176 ) from citizens united ad for " @entity179 , the movie " : who is @entity179 ? @entity174 , @entity181 , @entity182 : it started small			2
during last year 's presidential primaries , a federal court said campaign finance laws barred this ad for an anti-hillary @entity189 movie by an advocacy group , a non-profit corporation			1
from citizens united ad for " @entity179 , the movie " : if you thought you knew everything about @entity179 , wait ' til you see the movie			2
@entity196 : but now , the @entity149 could make a monumental change in how money influences politics , deciding , in the name of free speech , whether there should be any limits at all on corporate campaign spending			2
@entity205 , democracy 21 , @entity207 : allowing corporations to flood our elections and use campaign expenditures to buy influence would fundamentally undermine our democracy			1
@entity196 : @entity205 of @entity214 warns overturning a century of precedents would shut average citizens out of the political process			2
@entity218 : the little guy would have no role here , because the dominant force in our politics , the dominant force in @entity182 decision - making , would become corporations			2
@entity196 : but @entity229 of @entity230 , the group behind the anti-hillary @entity189 movie , argues that anyone pooling resources , including unions , the health industry , advocacy groups like the @entity236 , has free speech rights			1
@entity238 , @entity230 : i actually went out and looked for this fight , because i do n't believe the government should have the right to impede people 's entry into the process			2
and that 's what the @entity247 is trying to do here , squelch our first @entity250			0
@entity196 : interestingly , the @entity252 agrees			0
a final ruling is expected in a couple of months , and legal observers say conservatives could hold the key , with enough votes to possibly declare much of current campaign finance law unconstitutional			0
@entity174 , @entity0 , the @entity149			0
( @entity260 ) @entity261 @entity35 : six months ' worth of rain in two days ! that is what residents in parts of @entity266 are dealing with			0
this massive downpour triggered flash floods in the country this week , claiming more than 30 lives			0
in this video - look at this - you can see how the water rushed through a low - lying valley			1
it flipped and ripped up dozens of cargo trucks			0
hundreds of other vehicles were washed out into the sea			0
the country 's prime minister said emergency workers rescued around 1,300 people from the floods			0
he 's already pledged money to get help and relief to the affected regions that need it			0
@entity291 @entity292 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm a rock band originally from @entity295 , @entity296			0
i made my first @entity6 appearance in 1964			1
20 of my songs landed at number 1 on the @entity6 charts			1
and i was inducted into the @entity302 in 1988			0
i 'm the @entity303 : @entity304 , @entity305 , @entity306 and @entity307 ! the @entity303 : @entity308 @entity35 : they were a rock band			0
now the @entity303 are in @entity308 ! a new game featuring the famous @entity303 is out this week			0
it lets players jam out on dozens of the group 's biggest hits			0
plus , it gives younger audiences -- you -- a chance to check out some of rock and roll 's most famous songs nearly four decades after the band 's last gig			0
that 's not the only reason the @entity303 are back in the spotlight			0
all 15 of their albums have been re-mastered and put back on store shelves			0
purifying invention @entity35 : meanwhile , a famous inventor wants to do some re-mastering of his own			1
but we 're not talking about digital , we 're talking liquid			0
more than a billion people around the globe do n't have access to clean drinking water			1
sure , there 're water water everywhere , but if it 's not clean , it can cause serious consequences			1
@entity344 looks at one idea designed to quench the problem			1
( @entity176 ) @entity344 , @entity0 correspondent : water : it 's the most abundant resource on the planet , yet every year , millions of people die because they do n't have access to clean water			1
so @entity353 , the inventor of the @entity354 , decided to take this problem on with a machine he calls the " @entity357			1
" @entity353 , inventor : we believe the world needs a slingshot to take care of its goliath of a problem : bad water			1
@entity366 : he says the machine can turn contaminated water like this dirty river water into clean drinking water by boiling , distilling and vaporizing it			1
@entity373 : in goes the bad , and as you can see , out comes the good			0
@entity366 : the machine is smaller than some other water purifying systems , making it more portable			1
@entity373 : it 's ideally suited to go to places in the developing world			0
@entity366 : @entity353 says it requires very little electricity and maintenance to function			0
but until he finds partners and distributors to keep costs down , @entity386 wo n't be available to the people who need them most			0
@entity373 : we 've got to find better strategies to deal with this incredibly unique and valuable resource called water , that we 've all come to take for granted , but we 'll not be able to do that in the future			1
@entity366 : @entity344 , @entity0			0
( @entity260 ) before we go @entity35 : before we leave you today , we 've got a story about something that 's pretty darn fast			0
@entity401 may be the quickest person on the planet , but he 's got nothing on @entity404			0
the cheetah charged into the record books yesterday as the world 's fastest land mammal			0
she made the 100 - meter dash in 6.16 seconds			0
then she went out and shaved some more time off in her second attempt			0
now for reference , sprinter @entity412 did it in 9.58 seconds			0
think you could outrun her ? you 're welcome to give it a shot			0
goodbye @entity35 : but you 've got to make sure that she does n't break any rules			0
after all , she 's a cheetah			0
okay , we know a lot of you probably saw that coming , but you just ca n't miss the opportunity to make a cheetah pun			0
it 's where we cross the finish line for today , but we 'll be back tomorrow to close out the week			0
we look forward to seeing you then			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity32 .			0
