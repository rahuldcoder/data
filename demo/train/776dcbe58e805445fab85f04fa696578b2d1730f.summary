a lie about earning a ph.d. cost a @entity3 expert her job as an analyst days after her op - ed in the @entity7 was cited by secretary of state @entity8 and sen. @entity9 in congressional hearings about possible @entity12 military action in the war - torn country			1
@entity15 , who was an analyst at the @entity16 , said she had earned a doctorate from @entity18 when she had not , the organization announced wednesday			2
" @entity20 has learned and confirmed that , contrary to her representations , ms. @entity15 does not in fact have a ph.d. degree from @entity18			2
@entity16 has accordingly terminated ms. @entity15 's employment , effective immediately , " the institute posted in an online statement wednesday			1
the president of the institute , dr. @entity28 , said she was surprised to learn of @entity15 's lie just before the former senior research analyst admitted it on tuesday			1
the decision to terminate @entity15 's employment at the institute was made later that day , @entity28 said			1
@entity15 was hired a year ago as a research analyst , after she had been working as an intern at the institute for a few months			2
@entity15 proved to be an exceptional researcher and analyst , and @entity28 said she was " pleased and proud to move her forward			2
" last week , both @entity8 and @entity9 cited @entity15 's op - ed piece , which was published in the @entity7 on august 30 , titled " on the @entity40 of @entity3 's @entity41			1
" part of the debate over authorizing @entity12 military action is how many of the rebel groups are extremist and how many are moderate			0
according to @entity15 's op - ed , extremists and moderates exercise control over distinct areas of the country , and checkpoints are often set up to define territory			1
also , there are distinct areas where moderate rebels are in control and can keep weapons out of the hands of extremists , @entity15 told @entity59 in an interview last week			0
@entity8 and @entity9 agreed with @entity15 that @entity3 is a secular state ; @entity9 even called her op - ed " important			1
" initially , the @entity7 only recognized @entity15 as a " senior analyst " at the institute , but a clarification was later added , stating her affiliation with the @entity66 , a non-profit organization based in @entity67 that advocates a free and democratic @entity3			1
@entity15 responded on @entity68 last week to scrutiny over her association with the @entity3 rebel advocacy group , writing she never tried to conceal her ties with opposition and rebel commanders and is not being paid to advocate her views on @entity3			2
rather these connections allow her to travel more safely in @entity3 , she wrote			0
" i 'm not trying to trick @entity12 here , " @entity15 tweeted on september 7			0
before accepting her position as political director of @entity66 , @entity15 had to ask @entity28 for approval			1
@entity28 granted her permission because @entity15 said she would be distributing humanitarian aid to @entity3 people			2
@entity66 posted a news release online in may , welcoming " dr. @entity15 " to its @entity67 staff			2
the news release has since been removed			0
it 's unclear whether @entity15 still holds her position at the @entity66 in light of the revelations about her non-existent doctorate degree			1
the organization declined to comment wednesday			0
according to @entity28 , the institute never had reason to doubt @entity15 's qualifications , and she could not comprehend any motivation the former employee would have for lying about her education			1
@entity15 was not immediately reached for comment wednesday			0
@entity15 received a master of arts degree in @entity101 from @entity18 in may and was allegedly working on her dissertation for a @entity103 , which she told @entity28 she had completed later that month , @entity28 said			0
" i hired ( @entity15 ) without ( a doctorate degree ) and would have kept her if she had n't pursued it			0
so this is particularly sad , " @entity28 said			0
despite the lie , @entity28 said she is " confident " in the work @entity15 produced for the institute , because she and other research officials for the institute validate any research and argumentation that is published			1
also , @entity15 never had the administrative power to enter data into the institute 's resource database , she said			1
" i do trust her work , " @entity28 said			0
@entity15 has appeared on several television networks , including @entity121 , @entity59 , @entity122 and @entity123			0
last week , she was a guest on @entity124 and @entity125 , speaking about @entity3			0
because of the revelation about her false doctorate , @entity15 will not appear again as an analyst on @entity59 networks .			0

@entity15 was fired from the @entity16 for lying about a ph.d.
@entity8 , @entity9 cited her @entity7 op - ed " on the @entity40 of @entity3 's @entity41 "
@entity15 also was political director of the *nonprofit* @entity66
the institute 's director says she is " confident " in @entity15 's work despite ph.d. lie
