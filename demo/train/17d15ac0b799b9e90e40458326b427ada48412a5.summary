-- forget the @entity2 title -- @entity3 wants to build a dynasty at @entity5			1
the 60 - year - old , fresh from leading @entity5 back to the top of @entity9 football at the first attempt , is already planning for next season -- and , by the sound of it , many years to come			1
@entity3 , who signed a three - year deal last june after replacing @entity15 , also won the @entity16 and reached the last - 16 of the @entity17			1
and now , with his players enjoying an end - of - season break in @entity20 , home of owner @entity21 , @entity3 is plotting further success			1
it comes at a time when city rival @entity25 is in disarray , struggling to fill the vacuum left by @entity28 , who led the @entity30 club to unparalleled success over two decades			0
" it depends on the owners of the club , " @entity3 told @entity0 when asked about his plans to take @entity5 forward			1
" my way of thinking is that if you want to develop a club , the best way is to keep the manager for so many years if you can			0
" of course , at important clubs , the results are always very important , but with patience i think you can do better			0
" a big club must always have ambition			0
we will start thinking about how we can improve , we will analyze a lot of things and will try and be a very competitive team next year in the @entity2 , @entity51 and @entity17			1
" under @entity3 , @entity5 has become a far more attractive side to watch and the team 's goalscoring record has been remarkable			1
in the @entity2 alone , @entity5 plundered 102 goals in 38 games , while also triumphing at @entity57 by defeating @entity58 3 - 1 in the @entity16 final			1
@entity60 scored 20 league goals from midfield , while @entity63 -- who missed a large part of the season through injury -- hit 17 , and fellow striker @entity67 came up trumps with 16			2
the shift in style from a more cautious approach adopted under @entity15 has been well received by the @entity5 fans , and @entity3 feels vindicated after the early doubts surrounding his appointment			1
" it 's a style of football that i 've played wherever i 've worked in @entity82 and different countries such as @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , " said @entity3 , who then went on to manage @entity76 clubs @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79			1
" i also tried to play attractive football in @entity76 and be an offensive team			0
so doing it in a new league and the most difficult league in the world , it 's not just about winning the title it 's about winning with a style of football			0
" i do n't want to compare one with the other			0
@entity15 won a title before me and had another idea of the best way to play			2
i think he was very important for the club also			0
" one area in which @entity5 is yet to taste success is the @entity17 -- which its owners are desperate to win			2
in may 2013 , chief executive @entity106 stated that he wanted the club to win " five trophies in the next five years			0
" " i think we were very unlucky in the @entity17 , " added @entity3 , whose team lost to @entity110 in the second round			2
" but i 'm sure that we 've made a step forward this year and i hope next year will be better , including the @entity17			2
" in recent weeks @entity5 has reportedly been in discussions with @entity115 as to the severity of sanction it will face under the @entity121 governing body 's @entity119 regulations			0
that wait appears to have been increased following thursday 's death of former @entity125 prime minister , @entity124			0
the 73 - year - old was presiding over the investigatory chamber of the @entity128 , and was expected to sign off any agreement with the @entity2 club .			2
