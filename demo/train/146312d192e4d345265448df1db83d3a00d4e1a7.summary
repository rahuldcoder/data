-- @entity1 started where they left off last season by beating @entity4 2 - 1 in the curtain raise to the @entity7 @entity6			1
but the @entity7 champions , who ran away with the 2013/214 league title , were pegged back for long periods of the game and can count themselves lucky not have conceded a chance late on that @entity14 somehow missed from inches out			2
@entity17 's side was missing a host of first team starters with @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 all absent thanks to a mixture of injuries and suspensions			0
that meant that @entity17 was forced to hand 17 year old @entity30 his first ever @entity1 start			2
yet it was @entity4 that were the most impressive in the opening stages until @entity7 international @entity34 stabbed home and gave @entity1 the lead before half time			1
and things got worse for @entity4 when @entity43 , in scintillating form and showing no signs of fatigue after an excellent @entity41 this summer for @entity42 , sprinted through and placed his shot in the net			1
@entity4 quickly replied through the veteran @entity47 striker @entity46 , who curled home a wonderful long range shot into the top left hand corner past a beaten @entity51			1
but the match will perhaps be best remembered for what will surely go down as one of the misses of the season , even at this early stage			2
@entity58 midfielder @entity14 forced a superb save from @entity51 , who deflected his shot on to the bar			0
the rebound hit @entity61 , standing on the line , and it rolled harmlessly wide			0
after that , @entity1 held on for the perfect start to the season			1
@entity66 held meanwhile in @entity67 , @entity66 continued their stuttering start to the season with a 0 - 0 draw against @entity71 after seeing new signing @entity72 sent off			0
with @entity75 and captain @entity76 out injured , and @entity77 , who was on the receiving end of a vicious headbutt after @entity66 's 2 - 0 win over @entity81 last week , only on the bench , the champions could n't break a resolute @entity71 down			1
@entity66 had most of the possession and play until the 62nd minute when @entity72 , a summer signing from @entity84 who has been on an extended break since representing @entity67 at this summer 's @entity41 , was sent off for a second bookable offense			0
life got easier for @entity71 after the sending off and they might have snatched victory at the death when @entity92 's shot was kept out by @entity94 goalkeeper @entity93			0
despite being one of the richest clubs in the world after their @entity98 buy out , @entity66 have now drawn two and won one of their first three games and will be counting the days until @entity75 returns			0
late start in @entity103 in @entity103 the second leg of the @entity105 between @entity106 and @entity107 was was due to kick off at the @entity108 late friday			0
the first leg between the @entity107 rivals ended 1 - 1 .			1
