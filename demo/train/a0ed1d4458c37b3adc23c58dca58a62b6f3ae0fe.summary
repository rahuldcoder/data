@entity0 -- when stock markets are soaring , people think they 're making money because they 're geniuses			1
but when the market tanks -- which it always does , sooner or later -- people look for villains to blame for their losses			1
@entity11 says the real lesson of the @entity14 case is not to rely on others to protect your investments			1
that brings us to @entity14 , who has become the iconic symbol of the current horrible market and economic meltdown , even though he really had nothing to do with it			1
yes , @entity14 sure seems to be a really , really bad guy who ruined lots and lots of lives and should probably be locked up for the rest of his natural days			1
but @entity14 's misdeeds -- or as our lawyers would prefer , his alleged misdeeds -- have nothing to do with the market meltdown that has sliced trillions of dollars from our collective net worth			1
he 's become the symbol of the current meltdown the same way that uber - tastemaker @entity39 became a face of the 2001 - 02 corporate crime wave , even though the misdeeds of which she was convicted -- misleading government investigators -- were less than penny - ante compared to the multi-billion dollar frauds that first built up and then destroyed giant companies such as @entity47 and @entity48			1
along with @entity14 , the @entity49 is being portrayed as the villain of the piece , having failed to catch him long ago when his alleged depredations must have been much smaller			1
instead , it gave him a few wrist slaps until he confessed his misdeeds a month ago			2
but , tips from @entity58 money manager @entity57 over the years notwithstanding , it 's not at all surprising that the @entity49 missed @entity14			1
in fact , i 'd have been amazed if the @entity49 had been the ones to catch him			2
why ? i do n't want to seem cynical or jaded , but after almost 40 years of covering business news , i 've seen the same thing happen over and over because of the way regulators are trained			2
if someone runs a little bit out of the baseline by chiseling on numbers or playing some other game , regulators are pretty good at catching him ( or her )			2
but if -- like @entity14 -- you make up numbers from scratch and deal with huge sums , you 're so far out of the baseline that regulators are n't looking for you there			1
it 's very hard for an @entity49 regulator to wrap his head around the idea that an establishment guy like @entity14 -- a @entity87 market pioneer and an occasional consultant to the @entity49 -- is capable of just making things up out of whole cloth			1
but , it would appear , he was			2
and as an aside , it 's easy to blame @entity94 's anti-regulation policies for the @entity49 not catching @entity14			1
but @entity57 ' original tips reached the @entity49 when @entity96 was president			0
like newspapers , where i used to work , regulators get all sorts of tips coming across the transom			2
as in newspapers , i suspect , many of the tips end up ignored			0
@entity57 was right about @entity14 's operation being a fraud			1
but his magnum opus -- an 18 - page 2005 letter listing 29 " red flags " -- is quite dense and confusing , probably because he 'd gotten frustrated after years of not being taken very seriously			0
unfortunately , the letter did n't list what would have been ( in hindsight , naturally ) the simplest tip - off : that this supposedly multi-billion dollar operation was audited by an obscure three - person accounting firm			0
as @entity117 , a @entity118 , @entity119 , certified public accountant , pointed out to me after reading a @entity14 column i wrote for @entity121 , a simple database search shows that the firm had n't had a peer review since 1990			1
that would -- or should -- have set off all sorts of alarm bells			0
back to the main event			0
ponzi schemes , in which you pay existing investors not by making a profit but by getting money from new investors , have been around forever			0
like @entity14 , a jew who preyed on fellow @entity137 and @entity137 charities such as @entity140 's foundation , @entity136 schemers often target their own religious or ethnic groups			1
that way , they lure victims who feel flattered at having been asked to join an elite society , so much so that many of them fail to find out basic things , such as whether the securities or properties they 're supposedly being put into actually exist			0
consider these : @entity151 , a prominent @entity153 businessman is charged with running a multi-billion dollar scam that preyed on evangelical @entity155			0
a @entity0 man was recently accused of preying on fellow members of a @entity159 church			0
a @entity160 in @entity161 was accused on december			0
30 of preying on other @entity163 - @entity162			0
just yesterday , the @entity49 accused a @entity165 , @entity166 , man of preying on fellow @entity167			0
if someone , especially a member of your racial , religious or social group , offers you a deal not available to the general public , check it out			0
do n't rely on the @entity49 or any other regulator to do that for you			2
never , never , never put all your eggs in one basket , no matter how good it looks			0
and that , my friends , is the real bottom line			2
@entity184 and mock him all you like , he has it coming			0
but learn from him , too			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity11 .			1

@entity11 : @entity14 is being blamed for *collapse* of stock market values
he says @entity14 had nothing to do with it but escaped *scrutiny* for fraud
@entity11 says regulators *rarely* catch the biggest frauds
he says real lesson is to never rely on others to protect your investments
