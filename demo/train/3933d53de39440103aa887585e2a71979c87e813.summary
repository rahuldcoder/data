@entity0 -- visualize , if you will , a massive freeway interchange , with automobiles criss - crossing at varying speeds			1
some raced through the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis like they were just getting on the famous @entity10 autobahn , others have decelerated dramatically			2
we gathered an all - star panel of three central bank governors from @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 , the finance minister of @entity18 and the chief executives of @entity20 and @entity21 for a one hour discussion " @entity24 " at the @entity23 in @entity0			1
@entity25 : @entity26 is open for business the overall verdict ? the @entity30 markets , @entity14 , @entity26 , @entity31 , @entity15 and @entity32 , share little in terms of a common dna but investment in these markets are still paying handsome dividends due to the size of their consumer markets			1
at the top end , @entity15 should hit 8 % growth in 2013 , according to the deputy governor of the @entity45 @entity44			0
urbanization , he said , just crossed the 50 % mark and this flood of people into regional hubs in @entity15 will continue to boost growth			0
it has not been all smooth sailing for the world 's largest emerging market , stringing together seven straight quarters of declining growth , until recent numbers of the 4th quarter reversed that trend			1
how to fix @entity62 's challenge on the other end of the spectrum is @entity14			2
despite a sizeable market , a bounty of natural resources from forest products to deepwater oil deposits , and hosting the @entity69 and 2016 @entity70 to boost infrastructure spending and future tourism arrivals , @entity14 has gone into a downward economic spiral			0
today the heat is on president @entity76 to put @entity78 's largest economy back on a growth path after plummeting from 7.5 % growth in 2010 to just over 1 % when the final numbers are tabulated for last year			2
what 's your economic mood ? @entity85 , the affable central banker from @entity14 , tried to brush off long - term concerns when i asked if the president 's economic team was behind the curve when it repeatedly slashed interest rates to combat a slow - down			1
the team has been blamed for mismanaging expectations when they suggested 3 % or more growth could be delivered in 2012			0
even during this turbulent patch , @entity85 notes that nearly 40 million people have been pulled up into the middle class and that measures to cuts energy costs and payroll taxes will make @entity14 much more competitive			0
it is " better now than later " said @entity85 of the reforms finally in place			0
in a separate plenary session , @entity105 , the @entity106 managing director , said the emerging markets should use 2013 as a time to rebuild financial buffers and " rebalance their business models to boost domestic demand			1
" the @entity106 a day before the @entity23 got underway said that emerging market economies will grow 5.4 % , fractionally lower than the group 's forecast last october			1
@entity115 : what i 've learned from 20 years at @entity0 the stumbling performance of all the @entity30 minus @entity15 is what has led investors to home in on the next wave of emerging markets , especially the highly populated countries such as @entity16 , @entity125 and @entity18			1
@entity18 's new president @entity126 entered office december promising to deliver on a " @entity128 " of sweeping economic reforms , while trying to reboot relations with @entity131			2
finance minister @entity132 said their administration will use a comprehensive approach , which may even include opening up the state oil giant @entity138 to foreign investment			2
oil output has been on the decline for a decade and could benefit from the expertise of the @entity144 energy giants			0
the narrative has changed from the drug war that has claimed more than 60,000 lives to tapping into the economic potential south of the @entity149			0
growth opportunities have pushed poverty levels down 9 % to 42 % of the population and migration has been reversed , according to @entity132			0
@entity18 exports 82 % of its products to the @entity144 and that exposure led the economy down 9 % during the worst of the financial crisis in 2008 - 09			2
but if there is a leading light in terms of the next tier of fast - developing countries , one has to point to @entity16 , which has more than doubled its average growth rate over the past two decades to 7 %			1
the financial and political capitals , @entity166 and @entity167 , are booming and central bank governor @entity168 says it is a priority to spread the wealth to the other 35 states in the country			0
is the rise of @entity15 creating conflict ? the same tired themes still haunt @entity32 's second largest economy : poverty and corruption			2
@entity16 ranks 139 out of 176 countries in @entity181 's corruption perception survey			0
@entity168 said oil and subsidy regime fraud needs continued pursuit of perpetrators but his country is one of the few to put bankers in jail for their misdoings during the financial crisis			0
a great deal has been written about the @entity30 hitting a wall , with their better days being behind them , but the long serving chief executive of @entity21 said investors are lacking perspective			1
in the developed markets of the world , the average rate of automobile ownership is 500 to 600 cars per 1,000 inhabitants			0
@entity204 , the @entity14 - born ceo of @entity206 parents , said in the @entity208 markets could be as low as 100 per 1,000			1
this implies substantial growth , justifying the half trillion dollars or more of investment for plants being set up in these emerging markets .			1

@entity1 's @entity115 gathered an all - star panel for his discussion ' emerging markets at a @entity219 ' in @entity0
the *consensus* was that the @entity30 share little in terms of a common dna
but investment in these markets are still paying handsome dividends
