@entity0 , @entity1 -- as @entity6 funerary processions enter the graveyard overlooking the @entity9 suburb of @entity10 , their sobriety is often shattered by the sound of explosions and gunfire			1
frequently , the way forward is blocked by @entity15 conducting a combat exercise among the tombs			0
according to @entity6 custom , burial needs to take place within 24 hours , and the @entity15 will not halt their training activities there for the funerals			2
this is just another sign of religious freedom fading in the @entity26			0
much that is written about the @entity6 of @entity28 portrays them as a venerable and quaint religious community			1
but these followers of an ancient faith are not insulated from the tribulations of their country			1
@entity6 is named after its founder , the prophet @entity35 -- or @entity35 , as he came to be known in the @entity37 -- who preached sometime between 1800 and 1000 b.c. @entity35 spoke of humans siding with @entity40 ( called @entity41 , or the @entity42 ) against the devil ( called @entity44 , or the @entity45 ) and fighting for all that is right			2
in time , those concepts became central to @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50			0
so did @entity6 beliefs that each soul faces judgment after death before entering heaven , limbo or hell , and that all of humanity will experience resurrection , final judgment and heaven on @entity62			2
ancient @entity64 kings like @entity65 and @entity66 followed their faith 's basic tenet of doing good by freeing @entity69 from the @entity70 and supporting construction of the @entity72 at @entity73			1
@entity6 's clergymen , or magi , are known around the world as the wise men in attendance at the nativity of @entity80			1
until @entity84 conquered @entity28 during the seventh century , @entity6 , @entity82 and @entity83 there could practice their own devotions unhindered			1
thereafter , they became minorities who were persecuted and largely converted to @entity50			0
when the @entity15 revolution occurred in 1979 , fundamentalist @entity87 stormed the fire temple at @entity9			2
there , @entity6 worship in front of a blazing fire , as a symbol of @entity40 's grace , just like @entity83 face a cross and @entity96 turn to a qibla pointing toward @entity98			1
the portrait of @entity35 was tossed down , a photograph of @entity100 was put up in its place , and the congregation was warned not to remove the image of @entity28 's new leader			1
only months later could the prophet 's picture be mounted upon an adjacent wall			0
their schools and classrooms began to be covered with images of @entity113 and ayatollah @entity114 and with verses of the @entity116 that denounce non-muslims			0
those who do well academically nonetheless find no openings within state - controlled universities			0
when the bloody war with @entity123 raged from 1980 to 1988 , young zoroastrians were involuntarily drafted for suicide missions in the @entity28 army			1
rejecting the @entity87 mullahs ' claim that military martyrdom would lead them to a heaven full of virgins was futile			2
failing to offer their lives on the battlefield could result in execution for treason			0
then in november 2005 , ayatollah @entity136 , chairman of the @entity137 of the @entity138 , disparaged @entity6 and other religious minorities as " sinful animals who roam the earth and engage in corruption			1
" when the @entity6 ' solitary parliamentary representative protested , he was hauled before a revolutionary tribunal			2
there , mullahs threatened execution before sparing his life with a warning never to challenge their declarations again			0
a frightened community subsequently declined to re-elect him			0
over the past two years , many @entity154 @entity28 have begun publicly rejecting the @entity87 theocracy 's intolerant ways by adopting symbols and festivals from @entity6			1
those actions are denounced as causing " harm and corruption " by ayatollahs like @entity114 and @entity136			0
sensing that popular sentiment among @entity28 's @entity154 majority is shifting away from the mullahs , even president @entity163 has begun utilizing @entity6 's past for his own political ends			1
in september 2010 , he arranged for the @entity169 , a sixth - century @entity171 document that speaks of religious tolerance and @entity28 greatness , to be loaned from the @entity174			2
during a public ceremony in @entity9 , @entity163 lauded indigenous traditions as superior to @entity84 - imposed @entity50			2
privately , his chief of staff , @entity177 , even referred to @entity65 as " a messenger of @entity40			0
" their tottering political base has sharpened the @entity87 clerics ' ire			2
like members of the @entity49 , @entity82 and @entity188 minorities , @entity6 activists who protest the theocracy 's excesses are sent to @entity9 's notorious @entity189 on charges of sedition			1
at the ayatollahs ' instigation , @entity28 media characterizes the followers of @entity28 's ancient faith as polytheists and devil worshipers			1
@entity199 mullahs rant against @entity6 not only in @entity28 , but even at mosques in @entity202			1
the @entity6 cemetery outside @entity9 now faces another challenge : the municipality seeks to lay a highway through it			2
some schools and devotional centers in other @entity6 strongholds like @entity211 and @entity212 have also been notified of pending annexation			0
communal gatherings are routinely monitored by @entity154 authorities who allege that @entity6 " threatens national security and subverts the @entity15 revolution			1
" protections offered by the @entity26 's constitution have been rendered meaningless in practice			0
not surprisingly , the daily regimen of discrimination makes @entity6 feel wholly unwelcome in their @entity28 homeland			1
only between 35,000 and 90,000 now remain in a country of approximately 74 million citizens -- and , fearing persecution , many do not readily identify themselves as @entity6			0
yet , @entity6 are no mere footnote in human history and religiosity			0
their ideas still determine how many of the globe 's residents behave			0
the end of @entity6 in @entity28 should be prevented			1
making religious freedom a priority in @entity239 and @entity240 foreign policies will help achieve that goal			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244 .			0
