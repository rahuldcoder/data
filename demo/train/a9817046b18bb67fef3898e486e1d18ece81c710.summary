@entity0 -- as the @entity2 was preparing friday to debate a resolution branding @entity5 settlement activity in the @entity6 as illegal , @entity8 officials called @entity10 administration efforts to head off the vote as evidence that @entity14 policy is " biased " and " seriously wrong			1
" " this is a moment of truth because very clearly the @entity20 so far have placed their strategic alliance with @entity5 and the legal cover for @entity5 violations above their own interests , " said veteran @entity8 legislator and @entity17 executive committee member @entity15			1
" the @entity20 have very clearly demonstrated to @entity8 , to @entity26 public opinion , and to world public opinion that they are biased to the point of destruction , " @entity15 told @entity1 , echoing an argument made by many @entity8 officials			2
the resolution being brought to the @entity33 by the @entity8 and other @entity26 states presents a political dilemma for the @entity36 as it tries to navigate policy in a quickly evolving @entity39 region			1
the @entity10 administration has been critical of @entity5 settlement construction in the past , but has not gone as far as to call it " illegal " and anything short of an @entity14 veto of the resolution is bound to deepen tensions with @entity5 and stir up considerable congressional opposition			1
on friday , the @entity20 vetoed friday the resolution			0
the @entity20 ambassador to the @entity2 , @entity49 , said the @entity20 agrees about " the folly " of continued @entity5 settlement activity , but " we think it unwise for this council to attempt to resolve the core issues that divide " @entity5 and @entity8			1
@entity10 's first @entity2 veto the previous day , @entity36 spokesman @entity57 said the @entity20 does " not accept the legitimacy of continued settlement activity " and that it is " corrosive not only to peace efforts and a two - state solution , but to @entity5 's future itself			1
" president @entity10 on thursday called @entity65 president @entity64 to discuss the resolution and speak about alternatives to a @entity33 vote			2
among the options that have been floated , @entity14 and @entity8 officials said , was a @entity33 presidential statement which is weaker than an actual resolution			2
other ideas included stronger future statements from the international peace group known as the quartet , and the possibility of a @entity33 fact finding mission to the region			0
after the call , @entity64 called an emergency friday meeting of the @entity17 executive committee to discuss the issue but early indications suggest that the @entity8 will not agree to shelf the resolution			0
" if they keep trying to manipulate and water down a resolution to become a statement , and they start selling us used goods again it 's not going to work , " @entity15 said			0
" the legitimacy and strength of any leadership comes from the people not from @entity14 approval or disapproval and the @entity20 since the breakdown of @entity14 - brokered talks with @entity5 in september over the issue of settlements , the @entity65 has been pursuing a policy aimed at unilaterally declaring a @entity8 state by september based on borders from 1967 and in recent months has won recognition from a number of @entity14 countries			1
both @entity20 and @entity5 oppose the unilateral efforts insisting that all issues in the conflict must be dealt with through direct negotiations			0
@entity114 , a senior official in @entity64 ' @entity116 party , said @entity8 were determined to press ahead with the resolution and said the administration needed to adapt to changing regional circumstances			0
" obviously the @entity20 has to weigh its options , now amidst all the revolutions that are made and engineered by the people i think the voice of sense should prevail			0
... unless the international community pressures @entity5 to abide by its will by the will of the international community , it will be hard to see how the entire @entity39 could come to a rest			0
