" this is a time to start a new @entity0 , with a new economy , with a new education and with a new health system -- with one future , " @entity13 , @entity0 's transitional prime minister , said after proclaiming @entity2 's death			1
@entity2 was captured alive and unharmed as troops from the @entity17 overran his hometown of @entity19 on thursday , @entity13 said			1
but a gunbattle erupted between transitional council fighters and @entity2 's supporters as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle , @entity13 said , leaving @entity2 with a wound to his right arm			1

@entity51 reporter @entity50 in @entity19 old @entity53 's @entity52 the pipe is about 3 feet wide and filled with trash and sand			1
the phrases " the place of the rat @entity2 " and " you scum " were painted around its exterior , apparently after the capture			1
@entity13 said @entity2 was carrying a gun but did not resist his captors			2
@entity13 said dna samples confirmed @entity2 's identity , and the @entity68 -- which had issued an arrest warrant for the ousted dictator on war - crimes charges -- has agreed to allow @entity2 's burial			2
@entity47 said the @entity17 and the @entity0 people wanted @entity2 to be taken alive to answer for his crimes			1
in one video from the scene , a voice can be heard shouting , " no , no , we want him alive , we want him alive			0
" @entity48 , @entity80 and @entity81 officials said transitional government fighters captured @entity2 's convoy after @entity81 warplanes and a @entity48 drone forced it to a halt on the way out of @entity19			1
following @entity2 's death , @entity80 secretary - general @entity88 announced thursday that the alliance " will terminate our mission , " launched in march under a @entity92 mandate to protect civilians			1
@entity95 called for the @entity17 to mount " a full , independent and impartial inquiry " into @entity2 's death and said his inner circle and family should be " treated humanely and , if captured , given fair trials			2
" @entity100 , who was a @entity2 aide for nine years , said it did n't really matter whether @entity2 was dead or alive as long as he was no longer a fugitive			1
" as long as he was on the run , he represented a very ominous danger to the @entity0 people , " @entity100 said			2
" he represented a very ominous danger ... to the idea of the democracy in @entity0			2
" the streets of @entity108 echoed with celebratory gunfire , car horns and cheers as crowds ran or danced through the streets			0
celebrations extended into early friday in @entity108 and @entity33 , where crowds waved flags in the city 's main square long after midnight			0
on the surrounding roads , drivers leaned on their horns and came to brake - squealing stops as bands of revelers darted in and out of traffic			0
" a black era has come to an end forever , " the @entity0 ambassador to @entity127 , @entity126 , said in @entity128			2
@entity17 chairman @entity132 will officially announce on saturday @entity0 's liberation , media committee member @entity131 told @entity53 on thursday			1
council officials have said after such a declaration a new government would soon be announced and the democratic transition would begin			2
@entity2 's killing caps a revolt that began in february and left him a fugitive for the past two months			2
the mercurial former army officer , who seized power in a 1969 coup , was the third @entity144 leader ousted in the @entity146 upheavals that began in neighboring @entity147 in january			0
also killed thursday were @entity2 's son @entity148 and his chief of intelligence , @entity151 , said @entity152 , a spokesman for the @entity17 's military arm in @entity108			2

@entity158 , a professor of @entity160 politics at the @entity161 , said @entity0 still face a difficult political struggle			2
but , he added , " we should not underestimate the significance of this day			0
" " @entity2 was the head of the state , the most important symbol of the country			1
he repeatedly tried to rally his supporters to fight on , " @entity158 said			0
" i hope that this particular day will not just mean the end of an era , but basically represent the beginning of a new era			0
" @entity158 said the recent fighting around @entity19 and another holdout of @entity176 loyalists , @entity177 , exposed " some major tribal and regional cleavages " that @entity0 will have to bridge in forming a new government			1
those differences " could easily escalate , given the extent and the intensity of differences in @entity0			0
" but he said @entity2 's death sends a signal to other strongmen in the region : " if you oppress your people , if you do n't engage your civil society , if you stay in power for so many years , this will be your end			0
" @entity193 , @entity53 national security contributor , said the transitional leadership " faces very serious challenges , " citing groups outside @entity0 's borders , including @entity199 , as well as internal strife among the country 's tribes			1
" there will be those around them who seek to take advantage , " @entity193 said			0
" there will be tribal differences , there will be @entity2 loyalists who melt into the population and attempt to launch an insurgency like what we saw in @entity215			0
" prince @entity216 , whose family was overthrown by @entity2 42 years ago , told @entity53 , " i feel now that finally i can go back to a free country			1
a country that i have loved ... and i feel proud that the @entity0 people have done it themselves			1
" the confirmation of @entity2 's death came after hours of conflicting reports on the deposed leader 's status			0
when those reports first reached @entity48 secretary of state @entity227 during a visit to @entity230 , she reacted with one word : " wow			0
" @entity232 said the end of @entity2 would " add legitimacy and relief to the formation of a new government			1
" in a brief address from the @entity240 , president @entity238 praised @entity0 for lifting " the dark shadow of tyranny " with the aid of @entity243 air power			0
" one year ago , the notion of a free @entity0 seemed impossible , " @entity238 said			1
" but then the @entity0 people rose up and demanded their rights			0
and when @entity2 and his forces started going city to city , town by town , to brutalize men , women and children , the world refused to stand idly by			0
" @entity80 , spearheaded by @entity127 and @entity81 , backed up the revolt by bombarding @entity176 forces			0
in a statement from his office , @entity81 president @entity259 said @entity2 's ouster marks the start of " a new era ... one of reconciliation in unity and freedom			0
" @entity127 prime minister @entity268 said thursday " is a day to remember all of colonel @entity2 's victims , " including the 270 dead in the bombing of a @entity272 flight over @entity273 , @entity274 , in 1988 and " the many , many @entity0 who died at the hands of this brutal dictator and his regime			1
" other world leaders sounded encouragement for a new @entity0 , but cautioned that the road ahead wo n't be easy			0
" in the coming days , we will witness scenes of celebration , as well as grief for those who lost so much , " @entity92 @entity282 ban ki - moon said			0
" yet let us recognize , immediately , that this is only the end of the beginning			0
the road ahead for @entity0 and its people will be difficult and full of challenges			0
