-- as president @entity2 once again announced his intention to bypass @entity4 and govern through executive order -- this time with monday 's announcement on immigration -- history will ask , is he being presidential or imperial ? let us consider how his acute use of presumed authority measures up against rulers of other great nations			1
history is replete with the chronicles of kings and leaders from biblical times to the present day			2
in the @entity18 , we encounter @entity19 , who sought to do good in the eyes of @entity21 , observed the limits of his kingly mandate and brought relative security and prosperity to his people			1
others , including @entity28 , exalted themselves , debasing their character and leading @entity30 into the vicissitudes of calamity , defeat and ruin			2
the great kings of history are known to have protected their sovereignty effectively , some through benevolent decree and others through ignominious achievements			2
@entity41 brought an extended period of peace to @entity44			2
@entity45 expanded his empire with efficient brutality			2
holy roman emperor @entity48 abolished slavery and serfdom in the @entity52 dominions			2
@entity53 was known for his superior military capabilities and established the @entity55 , which forbade privilege based on birth			1
all ruled with relatively unchallenged decree			2
democracy took root in ancient @entity61 during the sixth century @entity62 of society were given a voice and vote in a representative democracy that dispersed political power among the people			2
many centuries later emerged the @entity70 after @entity72 subjects demanded from their king the right to vote , personal freedoms and participation in government			0
our @entity78 contains freedoms original to the @entity70			0
the evolution of our @entity83 democracy came through the wisdom of @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and other thoughtful intellectuals who envisioned a purposely divided government , with checks and balances through executive , judicial and legislative branches			1
in contrast to this vision and the obligations set forth in the @entity78 , @entity2 has openly asserted that he will utilize his pen and his phone ( and already has ) to change policy through executive orders ( royal decrees )			1
his unilateral display of power through executive orders circumvents the checks and balances of @entity4 and the limits of constitutional law , which he should know well as a former law professor			1
our founders created executive orders for emergencies during a time of travel by horseback when swift return by @entity4 was impossible			1
many presidents have used executive orders to make recess appointments and other actions , but @entity2 has issued executive orders to force major policy changes by decree , going well beyond the actions of some other leaders , misusing these emergency powers to enact his will and ignoring the people 's elected representatives			1
acting without authorization , the president has altered @entity133 , choosing not to enforce sections harmful to his friends and donors in government , unions and big business			0
he has expanded the regulatory scope of the @entity141 , pacifying his base of environmentalist supporters at the cost of jobs for ordinary , hard - working @entity83			0
when @entity4 acted on behalf of the @entity83 people and did not seek passage of the @entity149 , the president used executive order ( royal decree ) , leading to our current humanitarian crisis at the border of unaccompanied children unable to provide for themselves			1
as if living in a different century , @entity2 acts unilaterally , uninhibited by what he views as the " nuisance " of @entity4			1
most recently , he undermined our national security and impaired the safety of our soldiers by deciding to free five @entity162 commanders without consulting @entity4 before their release			1
when we think of kings , we think not only of how they ruled but how they lived			0
their lavish castles and opulent feasts			0
their lack of consideration as lower classes struggled			0
" let them eat cake			0
" so , too , is the perceived case with our president			0
in an economy with anemic growth from the president 's failed policies , where high unemployment has become the norm with 20 million people either under - or unemployed , a $ 17.5 trillion debt and dependence on the government required for all too many , @entity2 appears unaffected			1
our president fully enjoys the pleasures of his office			0
he vacations extensively , departing at will on @entity189 to luxurious resorts in @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 , where his advance team ( traveling at taxpayer expense ) scopes out the best golf courses			0
meanwhile , ordinary tax - paying families are cutting or restricting their vacations			0
@entity2 's behavior seems to fit better the description of royalty rather than president			1
while history records kings both celebrated and maligned , the president must realize he is not ruling in the centuries of kings			0
the media would do well to come to this realization and end their praise of this " president by fiat			0
" we have a carefully , purposely divided government and a system that has proven over two centuries to work remarkably well			0
the president 's contempt for the @entity78 and @entity4 should not be celebrated			1
tragically , @entity2 will go down neither as a great king nor as a thoughtful president who led the country through the rule of constitutional law and representative democracy			1
join us on @entity226 / @entity225 .			0
