-- @entity2 president @entity1 has stepped down , more than two weeks after the protests that began january 25 in the country -- and launched a flood of # jan25 and # @entity2 tweets as well as media coverage that broke the mold -- to remove the president from power			1
from the beginning , the revolution in @entity2 was propelled by the use of social media			1
it at least partlybegan on @entity15 with the creation of @entity15 groups that gained hundreds of thousands of members and promoted the early protests in @entity20			0
subsequently , the government blocked @entity15 and @entity22 and eventually shut down internet access completely			0
and with the outside world following the unfolding revolution online , political leaders and others , including @entity22 , spoke out against the violence and freedom of expression issues at risk			0
but even a government shut down could n't keep the news from flowing			0
@entity22 and @entity15 users found ways to work around the blackout			0
though , eventually access was completely restored			0
the events in @entity2 served as a flash point for journalists on the ground , too			1
for perhaps one of the first times in history , history itself has been recorded instantaneously , as reporters took to @entity22 to share 140 - character updates and personal stories from the protests			0
the messages provided a stark reality to readers in the outside world , especially as the protests turned violent and police turned on journalists -- the very people many of us outside the country were following			0
but @entity57 had its " @entity64 , " and although it could n't reach viewers in the @entity59 by cable television , it found a way to viewers -- on @entity63			1
the network live streamed @entity1 's public address -- in which many believed he would resign -- thursday via @entity63			1
but @entity57 's comprehensive coverage put it on the radar for @entity59 viewers and it created a campaign to bring its @entity73 - language network to @entity59 televisions			0
images of the turmoil spread around the world via @entity78 and @entity63 , too			1
@entity57 made its images available by a @entity81 license and its work reached an even broader audience around the world			1
without a doubt , social media , mobile devices and the web have brought the stories from @entity2 closer to home			2
and conversely , the events in @entity2 have shown the strength of these tools for both organizing and informing people			2
the @entity2 people and reporters alike found ways to share their messages even when the government tried to stop them			2
using @entity99 , proxy sites , third party apps and other tools , they were able to continue sharing news with those of us on the outside			1
and at the same time , the rest of the world found ways to use tech to curate and disseminate information			2
