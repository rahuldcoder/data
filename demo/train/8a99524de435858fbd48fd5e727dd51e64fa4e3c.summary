@entity0 @entity3 's first scheduled execution since last april 's controversial botched lethal injection is now in the hands of the @entity7 @entity6 to decide			2
@entity8 , who was convicted in 2003 for the first - degree rape and murder of his then - girlfriend 's 11 - month - old daughter in summer 1997 , is scheduled to be executed thursday at 6 p.m. ct at the @entity13 in @entity14 , about 130 miles east of @entity15			1
botched execution haunts inmate as death nears @entity8 's attorney , @entity19 , filed a motion with the @entity7 @entity6 on wednesday asking for a stay of execution , and is also asking the court to review @entity3 's lethal injection policies in general , after a federal appeals court rejected his appeal monday			1
" @entity3 's current execution protocol creates a substantial risk of severe pain , needless suffering and a lingering death , " @entity19 told @entity1			1
@entity31 , public information officer with the @entity32 , said @entity8 is scheduled to be executed using a three - drug combination of midazolam , vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride			1
@entity37 changing execution drugs @entity39 , a benzodiazepine that is still not @entity41 approved , is supposed to render the prisoner unconscious			2
vecuronium bromide is a paralytic , which is meant to paralyze all muscle movement and stop respiration			2
@entity47 's role is to activate nerves and induce cardiac arrest			2
@entity19 said the existing @entity6 protocol and precedent under review , 2008 's @entity54 case , is no longer relevant or used in any jurisdiction because different types of drugs are now used			1
he argued that the changes that have been made over the years are significant and " create a significant risk of harm			2
" " of particular concern is the use of midazolam , which has been involved in several extremely problematic executions , including the gruesome and horrific execution of @entity66 in @entity3 and the two - hour prolonged death of @entity68 in @entity69 in july 2014 , " @entity19 said			1
" in @entity54 , the court acknowledged that administering a paralytic and potassium chloride to someone who is not deeply unconscious would inflict an unconstitutional degree of pain and suffering			1
@entity39 is not capable of producing a deep , unconscious state			0
" @entity31 said the @entity32 will have " no further comments " until it sees what the @entity6 decides			0
@entity78 , a staff attorney with the @entity79 , said the big issue in front of the @entity6 is whether midazolam can reliably produce the level of unconsciousness needed to complete an execution			0
" it 's uncontested that administering those two drugs [ vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride ] to somebody who is conscious would cause unnecessary pain and suffering , " @entity86 said			1
" the real issue is that because there are issues about midazolam 's ability to induce the necessary level of unconsciousness , and @entity3 intends to paralyze the prisoner , that we 'll never know if he regained consciousness and experienced the effects of the second and third drugs			0
in all three executions where medazline has been used without a paralytic , we have seen problems that raised questions about the appropriateness of the drug			0
paralyzing them does n't make the problem go away , it just hides them from us			0
" @entity8 was originally scheduled for execution on the same night as @entity66 , april 29 , 2014 , but the execution was called off after the state took 43 minutes to execute @entity66 , a controversial event that was witnessed by media and state officials			1
witnesses said @entity66 was convulsing and writhing on the gurney , as well as struggling to speak , before officials blocked their view			0
the execution was halted , but @entity66 eventually died			0
a team of medical examiners ruled that @entity66 died from the state 's lethal injection			0
the report , which was released in september by the @entity32 , called the manner of death a " judicially ordered execution			2
" @entity66 's execution was the first time @entity3 had used midazolam as the first element in its three - drug cocktail , the same three - drug combination that is scheduled to be used in @entity8 's execution			1
@entity39 is generally used for children " before medical procedures or before anesthesia for surgery to cause drowsiness , relieve anxiety and prevent any memory of the event , " the @entity142 said			0
" it works by slowing activity in the brain to allow relaxation and sleep			0
" stay motions have also been filed with the @entity7 @entity6 for three other @entity3 death row prisoners scheduled to be executed soon : @entity158 , scheduled to be put to death on january 29 ; @entity160 , scheduled to be executed on february 19 ; and @entity161 , scheduled to be put to death on march 5			1
chemical mix and human error lead to controversial executions @entity1 's @entity166 contributed to this report .			0

@entity8 is to be executed thursday ; he raped and murdered an 11 - month - old
his lawyer says " protocol creates a substantial risk of severe pain , needless suffering and a lingering death "
