-- it turns out that @entity2 was a hippie			1
here 's @entity5 's wisdom on taxation , always worth dusting off this time of year : " we shall never make taxation popular , but we can make taxation fair			1
" see -- he 's talking about " fairness " -- and we all now know that 's code for social justice straight out of @entity16			2
and it was especially socialistic for him to invoke the concept back in a time when the top tax rate was 70 %			1
meanwhile , back in reality circa 2012 , we are having a typically overheated election - year debate about taxes -- and both teams in @entity26 have a point			2
republicans this side of @entity30 finally found a way to out - promise @entity33			2
after decades spent griping that the @entity36 's electoral power came from liberal 's limitless ability to promise public goodies , conservatives have realized that they can tap into @entity41 's anti-tax impulse by promising to lower taxes all the time , regardless of whether our nation is at war or running a long - term deficit			1
liberals have always had a hard time appreciating that the @entity49 was founded in part on a tax revolt			2
but historic perspective is the enemy of partisan ideologues , and on the flip - side , conservatives who idealize the past conveniently ignore that tax rates at the heart of the @entity58 were almost double what they are today			1
that was an outrage ; by comparison , today 's debates are about rounding errors			2
essentially , we are debating whether the top tax rate should go back to where it was during the @entity69 presidency -- 39.6 % , up from the @entity71 tax cut level of 35 %			1
and this would apply only to households making more than $ 250,000 a year			0
i happen to think using that threshold is a mistake			0
a family making 250k with two earners does n't deserve to be lumped in with the super-rich at the top tax rate			1
at the same time , someone such as @entity81 , who makes $ 56,000 a day off passive income from investments , should n't be taxed at just 14 %			0
@entity84 has a real weakness in this year 's debate , however			0
read through his play - to - the - base budget , and you 'll see the term " fairness " advanced over and over again			0
fairness is a noble goal and contributes to societal stability in the long - run			0
but the real argument for raising taxes is directly related to balancing budgets and reducing long - term deficits and debt			0
and that argument is rooted in rhetoric about the " shared sacrifice " needed to restore national greatness			1
after all , the world 's largest debtor nation can not remain the world 's sole superpower for long			0
@entity84 's fairness rhetoric bypasses that rational argument in favor of something fluffier -- namely , closing the growing gap between rich and poor via the tax code			1
this might excite the liberal @entity33 base , but it also serves to confirm negative stereotypes about wealth redistribution and the left that alienates independents and swing voters			1
on balance , i think policy arguments about moving the top rate to people making more than a million dollars a year makes good sense			1
republicans will balk out of deference to philosophy and big campaign contributors , but even 52 % of self - identified tea partiers support that benchmark			0
it is an additional irony that many conservatives are fine with raising taxes on those 47 % of @entity41 who do n't make enough money to pay federal income taxes , as long as top rates are lowered enough to make the overall shift revenue neutral			1
this is n't tax policy as much as it has become a shell - game masquerading as ideology			0
tax day is unpleasant , and it has become a colossal waste of time and money			0
the current tax code is roughly 10 times longer than the @entity150 , and @entity151 estimates that 6.1 billion hours are wasted in trying to comply with its byzantine structures			1
both @entity84 and congressional republicans have campaigned on tax reform and tax simplification in the past			2
the @entity158 and the sadly abandoned @entity84 - @entity159 imagined lowering rates and raising revenue by closing loopholes			0
the real tragedy is that such an agreement should be within reach -- but the 80 % agreement keeps getting eclipsed by the 20 % disagreement , that signature , stubborn hyperpartisan insistence on all or nothing			0
that brings us back to @entity2 's aphorism : " we shall never make taxation popular but we can make taxation fair			1
" it 's about the last piece of useful wisdom on the subject that we 've heard out of @entity26			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

@entity183 : @entity2 said taxes never popular but can be fair , when top rate was 70 %
he says today tax rates about half that and still *potent* issue for @entity33 , @entity190 seeking advantage
he says taxes should *reflect* shared sacrifice to restore @entity41 ; not for wealth redistribution
@entity183 : tax code byzantine , reform tries run into partisan brick wall , *taxpayers* suffer
