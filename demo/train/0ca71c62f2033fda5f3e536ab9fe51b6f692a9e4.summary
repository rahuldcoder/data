-- @entity1 thinks he knows what the @entity2 needs , even before @entity5 war planners do			1
the @entity2 , he says , needs @entity6			1
@entity1 is ceo of @entity8 â € ” maker of a futuristic - looking , 21st - century warship that he says can protect large @entity2 ships from attacks by small boats			1
simply put , ghost looks a lot like an f - 117 " stealth " attack jet â € ” on skis			1
a year after unveiling @entity6 and pricing it at $ 10 million per boat , the @entity2 has unofficially expressed interest , @entity1 said , but nothing more			1
the 60 - foot long ghost is shown bristling with weapons in slickly produced @entity23 videos while its stealthy silhouette slices effortlessly and ominously through the water			1
it surpasses 50 knots ( 57 mph ) by surrounding each ski with a bubble of air that helps it cut through water much easier than regular boats			0
it 's a concept called super-cavitation			1
ghost can be operated by a three - person crew			2
but this vessel also performs without a crew if needed , operated by remote control from a nearby ship			0
it can deploy 18 special forces troops without drawing too much attention			0
if @entity43 is n't taking a close look at ghost , @entity1 wants to know if it 's because his firm is too small			2
" our country right now is not that aggressive when it comes to working with small , innovative , high - tech companies , " @entity1 told @entity0 on the phone this week			0
" i love to pose the question : where are the @entity55 , the @entity56 , the @entity57 , in the defense industry ? " " a lot of times the reason why small companies do n't venture into it is because the barriers of entry are so difficult			2
" for its part , the @entity66 says there 's no official " requirement " for @entity6			1
translation : before the @entity2 can contract to buy @entity23 's ghosts , war planners must tell @entity73 it 's necessary for the nation 's defense plan			1
then the @entity66 would have to persuade lawmakers to shell out tax dollars to buy it			2
the @entity66 would n't comment to @entity0 specifically about ghost			1
@entity81 , a spokeswoman for the assistant secretary of the navy for research , development and acquisition , told @entity0 in an e-mail , " it 's not procedure to procure a system without established requirements			2
" " that said , industry input is encouraged and assists the [ @entity94 ] with innovation and the pursuit of emerging technologies , " @entity91 wrote			0
@entity1 said his company is " in constant communications with the @entity2 , " but " it 's very , very difficult to get through to the decision makers at the @entity66 today			1
" officials representing @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 have engaged in " serious discussions " about ghost with @entity109 , @entity1 said			2
but so far , none have signed purchase contracts			0
it 's unusual for a private contractor to build a near - fully functional prototype naval vessel long before the @entity66 has committed to a purchase			1
" we understood really early on that when you bring something this revolutionary to the government , it 's not going to be readily accepted			0
we knew we had to prove the technology worked to even sell it			0
" clearly , @entity1 is deeply committed to his company 's project			2
and he has been since 2000 , when 17 sailors died in @entity128 in the infamous attack on the @entity2 destroyer @entity131			1
@entity133 terrorists in a small boat set off explosives near the @entity131 , revealing the threat that small , high - speed boats pose to @entity5 warships near coastlines			1
" that showed every terrorist you can take very few assets and very little money and you can just about sink a @entity2 destroyer , " @entity1 said			1
now 14 years later , @entity1 said such attacks remain among the @entity2 's biggest threats			1
he 's pushing @entity6 as a deterrent to protect thousands of sailors who he said are still in harm 's way in the @entity152			0
longtime @entity43 - based defense policy expert @entity153 , director of @entity154 told @entity0 , " it 's hard to see what problem [ ghost ] solves that has n't already been solved several other ways			2
" traditionally the @entity2 " has n't had much use for such small craft , " @entity153 wrote to @entity0 via e-mail , " apart from inshore operations , since they generally do n't operate well in the open ocean due to large waves			2
" ghost is incredibly stable in heavy seas , @entity1 said , thanks to a gyroscope - stablized platform with sensors constantly monitoring and compensating for the rolling waves			0
" one of the obstacles that we 've had to face , " he said , " is that when you 're introducing something so new as ghost -- something that has n't been done before , thought of before , that flies completely differently than any other vessel -- it takes time for the government to be able to understand and to adapt to it			0
" for generations it 's been common for companies to take decades to develop and sell a successful weapons program to @entity189			0
" we set out to change that paradigm , " he said			0
" this is much more like you 'd see a high - tech start - up develop their business			0
" that reminds @entity1 of another machine that the @entity5 failed to embrace quickly			0
" the @entity199 tried to convince the secretary of war for years that an airplane was viable , " @entity1 said , but , according to historians , " initial negotiations went nowhere			0
" and we all know what happened after that .			0

company offers @entity66 a fast , stealthy attack boat called ghost
ghost could guard ships like @entity131 against terrorist attacks , maker says
@entity2 has unofficially expressed interest , maker says , but nothing more
manufacturer : it 's " very difficult to get through to @entity66 decision makers "
