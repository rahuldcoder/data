terrorism is nothing new to @entity3			1
but there are new , pressing questions tied to the latest threats -- ones that authorities are trying to answer in their quest to get the upper hand and keep the continent safe			2
@entity13 security services in recent weeks have received indications that the extremist group @entity16 may have started directing @entity13 adherents in @entity18 and @entity19 to launch attacks back in their home countries , a senior @entity13 counterterrorism official told @entity1 terrorism analyst @entity22			1
separately , a @entity24 intelligence source told @entity1 national correspondent @entity25 that the threat appears to involve as many as 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people ready to strike in @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 and the @entity32			1
the source said that @entity35 and @entity36 intelligence agencies identified an " imminent threat " to @entity31 , and possibly also to the @entity32			2
last week 's attacks in @entity29 are proof that these threats could become reality at any time			1
assessing how close @entity3 is to another such attack , and doing whatever possible to prevent it are top priorities now for @entity13 authorities			1
what is the nature of the threat ? beyond what has emerged about thursday 's raids in @entity31 -- which ended with two suspects dead -- details remain sketchy			1
the @entity13 counterterrorism official told @entity54 that there were indications that returnees from @entity19 and @entity18 had been directed by @entity16 leadership to launch attacks on @entity13 soil in revenge for airstrikes in @entity18 and @entity19			1
" that would be a game changer because @entity16 up to this point has not orchestrated any terrorist plots in the @entity67 , " @entity22 said			0
" there have been some @entity16 fighters who have come back , but they have launched plots on their own steam			0
" the official named @entity29 , the @entity73 and @entity31 as countries facing a particular threat and said counterterrorism agencies in @entity30 are also on high alert			1
several @entity13 nations , including the @entity73 , @entity29 , @entity31 and the @entity32 , are participating in the air campaign against @entity16 in @entity19			1
a senior @entity31 counterterrorism official told @entity54 that the suspected terrorist cell that was raided is believed to have received instructions from @entity16			2
@entity30 authorities , meanwhile , said they had arrested three men on suspicion of links to @entity16			0
a 26 - year - old man suspected of having trained to fight in @entity18 and trying to recruit others to join @entity16 was detained in @entity88 on thursday ; and two men in their early 40s suspected of supporting @entity16 in @entity18 were taken into custody in @entity91 on friday			0
but none of the men appear to have been planning attacks in @entity30 , authorities said			2
are there concerns about any other groups ? @entity99 has claimed responsibility for the deadly shooting at the offices of @entity29 satirical magazine @entity103 in @entity104 last week			1
@entity106 authorities said they thought the video was authentic			0
but they were n't ready to say that @entity99 helped carry out the assault			0
" we 're not there yet			0
there are good indicators " that the group was behind the attack , but the intelligence community is still assessing , a senior administration official told @entity1			0
at least a dozen people were detained in the @entity104 region overnight in connection with last week 's shootings , the city prosecutor 's office said friday			1
the @entity13 counterterrorism official told @entity54 that there was also significant concern about @entity126 , an @entity128 affiliate group , plotting attacks against @entity3			1
last week , @entity130 , the head of the @entity73 security service @entity131 warned that a group of core @entity128 terrorists in @entity18 was planning mass casualty attacks against the @entity67 , an apparent reference to the @entity126 group , according to @entity54			2
are @entity16 and @entity128 working together in @entity3 ? that does n't seem to be the case , despite the apparently mixed affiliations of the @entity104 attackers			2
@entity145 and @entity146 , the two brothers who @entity29 authorities say carried out the @entity103 attack , are believed to have had links to @entity99			1
but @entity148 , who attacked a kosher supermarket in @entity104 and demanded that police end their siege of the @entity146 brothers , pledged allegiance to @entity16			0
in @entity18 , @entity16 and @entity128 have become fierce rivals since they severed ties early last year			0
" i think the leadership of the two groups is not working together			0
and indeed , in many cases in @entity18 , they have fought each other , " said rep. @entity159 , a senior member on the @entity106 @entity160			0
" but outside of the theater of war , it certainly appears that those collisions and conflicts are less important to some of the people who are radicalized			0
" " in @entity29 , as in probably the @entity106 , @entity3 and elsewhere , you have people that have a closer affinity to one or the other , " he told @entity1			1
" some have been just radicalized online , and maybe the message of @entity16 and the caliphate resonates more , " @entity159 said , using another acronym for @entity16			0
" others may have actually received training or support from @entity99 , as may have been the case with the @entity146 brothers			0
and plainly , they do n't have a problem working together overseas to attack @entity24 targets			0
" the @entity13 counterterrorism official told @entity54 that the possible shift by @entity16 to direct attacks in @entity3 was partly the result of increased competition between @entity16 and @entity128 affiliates , including @entity126 , to be seen as the standard bearers of global jihad			1
are the @entity31 raids connected to the @entity104 attacks ? @entity1 affiliate @entity195 reported that the terrorism investigation in @entity31 started weeks ago , and there has been no connection established with the @entity104 attacks			1
the three people targeted in the raid in the city of @entity202 , in which two of them were killed , had been under surveillance for some time , said @entity31 prosecutors ' spokesman @entity206			1
a @entity24 intelligence source told @entity1 that the @entity104 attacks played a role in accelerating the timing of the @entity31 operation			1
that included the arrest of a @entity31 arms dealer suspected of providing weapons to @entity148			2
@entity31 investigators questioned the arms dealer and searched his possessions , the source said			2
through him , the investigators got a number of " positive hits " on suspected extremists already known to authorities			0
after the @entity104 attacks , the source said , investigators stepped up the urgency			0
how big is the challenge facing security agencies ? @entity13 officials have been warning for months about the unprecedented challenge posed by fighters returning from @entity18			1
more than 3,000 @entity13 have left to fight in @entity18 in recent years			2
the total number who have returned to @entity3 is now estimated to be over 500 , according to @entity54 , including 250 who have returned to the @entity73 , almost 200 to @entity29 and around 70 to @entity31			1
an indication of the potential threat came last year in the deadly shooting at the @entity237 in @entity238 , @entity31			2
the suspect in that case is @entity241 , a @entity29 citizen who has also been accused of helping to guard @entity16 ' @entity24 hostages in @entity18			2
@entity241 was arrested in @entity29 and extradited to @entity31 to face trial over the museum shooting			1
he has denied the charges			0
but the sheer number of @entity13 returning from @entity18 , as well as those suspected of other jihadist activities , makes the task of identifying who is a threat very difficult for law enforcement agencies			0
" if there are literally hundreds of people going back to @entity3 , the ability of the police to literally sit on everybody becomes problematic from the standpoint of having the manpower , " said @entity252 , who was secretary of homeland security under president @entity253			0
@entity1 's @entity261 contributed to this report .			0

@entity13 authorities are busy after last week 's terror attacks in @entity29
there 's been a raid in @entity31 and arrests around @entity3
officials are trying to assess the nature of the threats
