@entity0 -- @entity3 military aircraft flew just 500 feet over two @entity5 ships this week as the ships participated in a joint military exercise with @entity8 in the @entity9 , according to @entity11 military officials			1
two @entity3 @entity13 maritime patrol aircraft flew only 500 feet above a @entity11 aircraft carrier			1
on monday , two @entity3 @entity13 maritime patrol aircraft , known as " @entity16 , " overflew the @entity11 aircraft carrier @entity17 while it was in international waters in the @entity9			2
the @entity3 aircraft flew about 500 feet over the ship , lower than other flights the @entity3 have made over @entity11 ships in the past year			1
the @entity17 was about 80 miles east of @entity23 , @entity8 , participating in the joint military exercise when the flyover occurred			0
on tuesday , the @entity26 , a lead command and control ship , and the @entity17 were overflown by two @entity3 " @entity29 " long - range bombers multiple times , according to @entity11 military officials			0
the @entity32 overflew the ships at about 2,000 feet , officials said			0
@entity11 military officials said that in both cases , @entity5 @entity35 fighters met up with the @entity3 aircraft about 70 nautical miles from the @entity11 ships and flew alongside them until they left the area			2

@entity3 long - range flights skirting @entity11 or other nations ' boundaries have also been common over the last year			0
