@entity0 -- the @entity5 administration is withholding some military aid to @entity7 as it reviews how to proceed with any future help as deadly political violence continued to flare , a @entity3 official told @entity1			1
but the @entity10 said repeatedly on tuesday any suggestion aid had been halted beyond two areas that have already been announced was inaccurate , and that a review of all assistance programs to @entity7 is ongoing and no determination had been made involving the results of that assessment			1
" providing foreign assistance is not like a spigot			0
you do n't turn it off and on or turn it up or down like a faucet			0
that is , it 's provided in specific tranches , " @entity10 spokesman @entity25 said			1
" there are tranches of assistance that have gone to @entity7			1
there are also some that have been stopped , " he said , noting the cancellation of military exercises in september and the delay of fighter jet shipments			2
but @entity40 , a spokesman for sen. @entity41 , confirmed to @entity1 on monday that his office was told that military aid has been halted			1
@entity41 , a @entity45 @entity44 , is chairman of the committee that oversees such funding			0
" as we noted yesterday , the @entity50 and @entity51 was told that the transfer of military aid was stopped , that this is current practice , not necessarily official policy , and there is no indication of how long it will last , " an aide to @entity41 reiterated in a statement on tuesday			1
but the @entity3 official who spoke anonymously said the move is being described as a " reprogramming " of some funds to @entity7			1
in effect , @entity0 is temporarily holding up some assistance as it prepares for the possibility future help could be cut			2
that official emphasized no decision has been made to permanently halt assistance and the administration would consult with @entity70 before deciding how to proceed once its review is completed			1
but @entity25 said the term " reprogramming " is not correct , and that the current approach is partly designed to " preserve some flexibility " so that the review can give president @entity5 a " range of options " once it 's finished			2
" i think that would probably be maybe a more accurate way of describing this , " he said			0
what it means the situation is an enormously sensitive matter , seeing that @entity7 is a key ally at peace with @entity87 and a strategic lynchpin in the volatile @entity89			2
if the @entity3 were to designate the military 's ouster of @entity7 president @entity93 a " coup , " it would have to cancel aid and could n't restore it until a democratic government is established			1
so far , it has n't applied that designation , but stepped up clashes over the past week between security forces and @entity103 demonstrators that have killed 900 people has heightened pressure to take stronger action			1
@entity7 security forces may have upped the ante on tuesday by arresting @entity109 , a spiritual leader of the @entity110 , the long - repressed political movement that propelled @entity93 to office			1
state - run @entity113 said @entity109 is accused of inciting violence			0
but if @entity0 continues with its current approach , it can withhold aid as long as it thinks doing so would be in its best interest			0
the @entity3 could restore the aid without needing a legal determination that a democratic government has returned			2
if , for example , @entity7 stops the bloodshed , the aid could quickly resume			2
@entity25 said on monday the purpose of the review is to determine the potential impact on @entity3 national security , whether the law is being followed and what will result in the " kind of outcome " that the @entity3 is pressing for , a prompt return to a democratically elected civilian leadership			1
he said @entity3 involvement extends beyond a military relationship and includes influence at the @entity138 as well as on tourism			2
billions in aid on the line : what will the @entity3 do ? ' damned if you do ... ' more than half of @entity3 in a new poll believe the @entity3 should halt military aid			1
but the situation is complex			0
" the @entity3 is kind of in a ' damned if you do , damned if you do n't ' situation , " said @entity148 , associate director for research at the @entity150			0
analyst @entity153 said the issue centers on what @entity0 wants to accomplish			0
" if you are trying to change the decision - making process of the @entity7 military -- that is very hard to do right now because they believe they are locked in an existential struggle , " said @entity153 , @entity89 program director at the @entity156			2
" if what you are trying to do is demonstrate our resolve to the rest of the world and people looking on , that is another issue			0
" but the aid is n't one - sided			0
the @entity3 has been granted preferential use of the @entity174 -- an economic hub that connects the @entity176 and the @entity177			0
it also has overflight rights , which gives the @entity3 military the ability to fly over @entity7 on the way to bases in the region			1
will cutting aid do anything ? cutting aid will probably not accomplish much , some experts say -- particularly because @entity189 has said it would consider matching the @entity3 assistance if the @entity5 administration decides to cut it			1
" our @entity70 is not about to compete with that amount of money in @entity7 , " said @entity193 , senior fellow at the @entity194			0
" ( the @entity189 ) have deep pockets , and they are ready to put them in @entity7 's disposal			0
" but @entity148 said there could be a net effect			0
if the @entity3 diversifies its engagement with @entity7 , " not only the @entity5 administration , but any administration after would have for more policy flexibility , " he said			1
@entity1 's @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 contributed to this report .			0
