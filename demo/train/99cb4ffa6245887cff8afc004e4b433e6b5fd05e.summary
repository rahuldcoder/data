so prince @entity0 and @entity1 are combining work with play this week , bringing their privileged progeny , @entity6 , on a three - week tour of @entity8 and @entity9			1
having their own plane filled with personal staff would certainly make the 20 - hour flight easier than the rest of us have it			1
for one , it 's likely the royal staff do n't roll their eyes in annoyance as @entity1 struggles to soothe @entity24 's wails , his little ears in pain due to changing air pressure			1
nor does she have to beat the post-dinner in - flight pee rush and squeeze into a tiny washroom to change his royally soiled nappy			1
for most travelers , flying long haul with kids -- particularly babies -- stomps on any romantic notions of travel being about the journey , not the destination			1
as a @entity42 mother who lives in @entity43 , @entity44 , i 've been taking my two boys -- now aged five and six -- on the 20 - plus - hour multi-flight journey back home to see family annually since they were born			1
here are a few key things i 've learned along the way			0
before you go : pre-order the kids ' meals your average long - haul flight -- say , journeys of more than eight hours -- still serves meals in economy class for free			1
that 's where the good news ends			1
to be fair , airline food has improved in recent years			0
when you peel back the foil top of that hot rectangular dish , exclamations of " man , i ca n't wait to dig into that grotesque mash - up of peas and rubbery chicken " rarely follow			2
and good luck trying to serve it to your average five - year - old			1
( go ahead , tell me your child is a wonderful eater who loves rubbery poultry and hard peas			0
) fortunately , many airlines allow you to order child 's meals when you book your flight			2
this is essential -- they usually only bring as many meals as were ordered , so extras are rare			0
sample dishes my kids have had on recent flights include macaroni and cheese , ravioli with tomato sauce and simple fried rice with pork			2
i wanted to trade , they were n't having it			0
a bit of junk food is ok yes , yes			0
junk food is bad , the world is getting fat			2
but until you 've experienced the horror of not sleeping in a bed for 30 - plus hours because you promised your niece you 'd fly from @entity43 to @entity108 so your six - year - old could be a ring bearer in her wedding , you really ca n't judge a mom for letting her kids rip into a pack of @entity116 cookies so she can have a few minutes of peace			1
on long - haul flights i always bring a few extra packs of snacks my kids are only allowed on rare occasions , along with their usual healthy goodies			1
but i avoid chocolate ( messy ) and other high - sugar items , for obvious reasons			2
now is not the time for a sugar high , but neither is it an occasion to be too rigid about nutrition			0
trust me , that little bag of potato chips is going to keep your kid quieter on those first critical moments of a flight than those organic / gluten - free / cranberry - flecked granola bars you whipped up a few hours earlier			1
@entity138 even gives child fliers a metal cartoon - themed lunch box filled with a chocolate bar , a big juice box , gummy candies and cookies			2
regardless of what you feed your kids , the chewing makes the air pressure changes easier on their ears			2
consider flying when they 're asleep some kids can sleep anywhere			1
others ca n't , and will meltdown into a terrifying , pig - tailed mini monster right before your horrified eyes			2
ask yourself what category your kid fits into when booking that red - eye @entity164 - to - @entity165 flight			1
personally , i prefer overnight flights as it gives me a chance to get some sleep as well			2
maybe even watch a movie as i enjoy my meal of rubbery poultry and sneak in a glass of white wine			0
plus , trying to fill an entire 13 - hour flight with fun but quiet activities is challenging			1
by the end of one particularly long , sleep - free flight from @entity182 to @entity183 i wanted to crawl into the aisle and let the flight attendants run me over with the drink cart to put me out of my misery			1
take advantage of early boarding " we now invite passengers with small children to begin boarding at this time			0
" when you hear these magic words , grab the kids and make a break for it			1
sure , boarding first means even more time confined in close quarters with your darlings			0
but having a few extra minutes to get the kids settled as they fight over the window seat , and actually finding a space in the overhead compartment for your carry - on luggage right above your seat , are reward enough			1
bulkhead seats are n't for everyone there 's no denying the bulkhead seats are awesome			1
more leg room for you and extra space for toys is always a good thing on a flight with kids			1
if you 're flying with a baby , it 's also one of the few spots on the plane where the airline 's bassinets can be set up			1
these need to be requested in advance but are highly recommended if your baby weighs under 25 pounds and you 're flying for more than five hours			2
but remember , the armrests do n't usually lift up in bulk - head seats as they have to store the tray tables			1
not ideal if you are on a night flight and trying to get a two - year - old to sleep comfortably , which usually means lifting the armrest and spending a few hours with a pair of cute little legs stretched across your lap. 6			1
gadgets good , ear buds bad remember what i said about junk food ? the same thing applies to electronics			1
now is not the time to adhere to your " no more than 30 minutes of tv a day " rule			0
the in - flight entertainment system is your best friend on a flight			1
hours of kids ' movies and tv shows			2
if you 've got an @entity257 or an @entity258 , load it up with new kid - friendly apps your children have never tried before you fly			2
it 's also wise to buy some proper headphones that will fit on your kids ' heads			2
airline headsets -- especially those annoying ear buds -- are n't built for little ears			0
the drugs do n't work ( for everyone ) the first response from child - free people upon hearing you 're flying overseas with your kids ? " drug them			1
" as much as we all fantasize about enjoying a silent flight punctuated only by the light snores of heavily tranquilized children , bear in mind that shot of @entity285 you slipped little @entity286 before takeoff could backfire			2
it 's wise to know the effects the medicine will have on her before your flight , as antihistamines can make some children hyper			0
you obviously do n't want your three - year - old hopped up on cold meds , crooning the " @entity299 " theme at the top of her lungs for 10 hours			0
also worth bearing in mind , in some parenting circles drugging your kids is considered tantamount to child abuse			0
the element of surprise along with the snacks , games and other meltdown prevention essentials you 've packed -- their favorite blanket is a must -- it 's wise to throw in a few surprises			0
now that my boys are older i 've stopped doing this but when they were around three and less enamored with their gadgets i found it useful to buy a few little treats to reveal mid-flight , which would occupy them for a few precious moments			0
think noise - free goodies like stickers , new crayons , coloring books , puzzles , little cars and dolls			0
some airlines also offer free gift sets for kids , always a nice bonus			0
meanwhile , if you let your kids pack their own bags of travel toys , you 'd be wise to check what 's going in there			0
my four - year - old son once slipped a plastic water pistol into his carry - on suitcase before the flight and sobbed in devastation -- " but it 's not reeeeeeaaaaal ! " -- as he watched an unsympathetic airport security agent chuck it into a garbage bin			1
do n't forget who 's in control most people get it			0
kids are kids and some noise is expected			0
but it really is the parent 's job to make sure their child is occupied and not driving everyone insane			0
nobody is going to sympathize with the dude who lets his / her kid run wild around the plane shrieking or kicking the backs of people 's seats while opening and closing the meal tray on a 12 - hour cross-pacific flight			1
before any journey , i find it helps to remind kids what will happen and what 's expected of them			0
especially the part about having to sit down and wear their seat belt when the light 's on			0
if a child is over three , they 'll usually understand			0
and if they do n't , a stern word from the flight attendant will likely scare them straight			0
want to earn bonus points ? follow this dad 's lead and hand out candies and ear plugs to your fellow travelers			0
when that plane finally pulls up to the gate after a long night of telling yourself " this too shall pass , " there 's nothing quite like hearing a departing passenger utter those tear - jerking words of validation : " wow , your kids were really well - behaved			1
" and if they were n't ? who cares			0
more : do kids and first class mix ?			0
