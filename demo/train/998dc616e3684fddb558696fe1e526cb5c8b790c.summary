some veterans injured in combat in @entity4 and @entity5 are being made to wait for months in the @entity6 despite a national mandate they be given priority access to medical care , a @entity1 doctor told @entity10			1
dr. @entity11 , medical director of the @entity1 's post-deployment clinic , outlined the allegations in a report that aired wednesday night on @entity10 's " @entity15 360 Â°			1
" she accused the @entity1 -- up until at least three weeks ago -- of not following a mandate that the highest priority be given to new or injured veterans for scheduling appointments			2
wait lists in @entity1 for veterans injured in combat in @entity4 and @entity5 can be " six months , nine months or longer , " @entity20 said			1
" people that are 100 % service - connected that are polytrauma were waiting anywhere from six to 10 months to get into a new appointment when i found out about ' em , " she said			1
" we 're talking about people that were injured by being blown up by @entity32			1
we 're talking about people who had a mental breakdown and have severe ptsd and ... are having trouble functioning			1
" @entity20 told @entity10 that in some instances because of those wait times , case managers in her clinic and patient advocates ask : " this guy ca n't wait			1
can you see him ? " the doctor said she reported the alleged practice to the @entity1 's @entity47			1
the @entity1 did not directly respond to @entity20 's allegations , referring @entity10 instead to the testimony of @entity50 secretary @entity51 before a @entity53 committee looking into the allegations : " it is important to allow @entity47 's independent and objective review to proceed until completion , and @entity47 has advised @entity1 against providing information that could potentially compromise their ongoing review			1
" @entity20 's claims are the latest in a rapidly unfolding scandal amid allegations of scheduling tricks and secret lists to hide monthslong waits for care			2
these accusations have mushroomed since @entity10 first reported the problem in november in an investigation examining several @entity1 hospitals			1
read the story that helped expose the problem the most disturbing problems emerged at the @entity1 , with sources revealing details of a secret waiting list			0
according to the sources , at least 40 @entity78 veterans died while waiting for care at the va there			0
the allegations have been followed by news of investigations at more than two dozen facilities across the nation			0
the problem , according to @entity20 , has to do with the @entity1 not having enough medical providers to care for veterans			2
there are a few reasons for this , she said : low pay , lack of qualified professionals applying to work at the @entity1 and a slow hiring process			0
" as a result , you 've got a lot of patients and not enough providers , " she said			0
" it 's not just @entity1			2
it 's across the country , which is why everyone is hiding a backlog			0
" @entity20 's allegations came the same day president @entity108 vowed to hold accountable anyone who manipulated or falsified records at @entity1 facilities			2
he also said he was sending his deputy chief of staff , @entity112 , to visit the @entity1 facility and interview the @entity1 office 's interim director			0
@entity20 said she has not dealt with a veteran patient who subsequently died , but she said she was aware of a disturbing trend of suicides			0
" these guys who committed suicide , who were successful suicide completions , would have benefited from more intense mental health treatment , " she said			0
" and those appointments were n't available			0
" so why has n't anyone been fired yet ? @entity126 : @entity127 has to stop with @entity108			0
