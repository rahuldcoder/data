-- the opening day of the @entity2 brought joy and sadness to the host nation as @entity6 won its first game , rallying to defeat @entity8 3 - 1			1
but it was a day marred by a small , but contentious , protest over the billions spent on the sports spectacle			2
here are five things that happened thursday as the first ball was kicked in @entity15			1
protest problems the most expensive @entity2 is underway			2
@entity18 officials shelled out $ 11 billion on the tournament , three times what organizers in @entity22 spent for the @entity24			2
not surprisingly , there are @entity18 who believe the money could have been better spent			1
with reporters descending on @entity15 for the opening match , protesters tried to make their way toward @entity32 stadium and were met by tear - gas firing riot police			1
the cops ' goal : to keep the demonstrators from reaching the main avenue , leading to the stadium			2
it was n't a big protest , but it was met with a big response			0
at least one person appeared to be arrested			0
several people were injured , including a @entity0 producer and reporter			0
mind control the best kick of the day went perhaps two yards			1
a paraplegic , identified by the @entity49 as 29 - year - old @entity50 , wore an exoskeleton and a blue cap fitted with electrodes			0
the electrodes helped him use his brain to control the exoskeleton to take a few steps and take the ceremonial first kick before the opening match it went about 6 feet before a ball boy scooped it up and took it to the center of the match officials			1
" we did it ! ! ! " dr. @entity67 tweeted			0
@entity67 , a @entity18 - born neuroscience professor at @entity69 , and a group of scores of scientists developed the exoskeleton after they decoded the alphabet of neurons in the brain and figured out how to transmitted the mind 's language to devices outside the brain			1
bad start that penalty that everyone is talking about , the one that should never have been given , well , it should probably have been stopped			1
it was a double punch in the gut for @entity91 fans			0
first , referee @entity92 awarded @entity6 an undeserved penalty kick			1
it seemed obvious to almost everyone watching the match that @entity18 striker @entity97 went down in the penalty area on his own , but @entity92 must have thought there was contact from a @entity91 defender			1
then when @entity103 's hit his spot kick , goalkeeper @entity102 guessed correctly and got a hand on the ball -- but he could n't stop it from going in the goal			1
@entity8 's coach did n't worry about any fines from @entity111 after the match for critical remarks against the referee			2
if we continue in this way , we will have a circus , " said @entity116 , according to @entity117			0
" if that 's how we start the @entity2 , then we may as well give up and go home now			0
" maybe it 's time for a manager 's challenge and instant replay ? when doves die you release three doves in an open - air stadium with 60,000 screaming people and helicopters circling overhead , what could go wrong ? well , it appears from media reports that at least one -- possibly two -- did n't live to see themselves home			2
one dove took a header into the stands almost immediately after liftoff , wrote the @entity141			0
other media reported a second crashed			0
but there was good news			0
" exciting dove update , " tweeted @entity146 of the @entity148 newspaper , " the one remaining dove has flown into the press box ! " it was n't the first misstep of the day			0
during the opening ceremony , the motorized stage riser hiccupped as rapper @entity157 and singer @entity158 ascended from inside the setup			0
at one point , it even appeared it might sink back under the stage			0
but it stopped and @entity157 stepped up a few feet and , once out , helped @entity164 out from the hole			0
traffic trouble the @entity167 , which plays it first match of the tournament on monday , wanted to have a private scrimmage against @entity172 on thursday			1
but with a transit strike making bad traffic worse , @entity172 coach @entity174 and @entity167 coach @entity175 agreed to call off the match , @entity173 reported			1
perhaps they should have rescheduled and traveled during the @entity6 - @entity8 match ; the roads of @entity15 were practically empty then			1
except for the protesters and riot police ...			2

some protesters think @entity6 is not rich enough to spend so much money for a sporting event
man takes ceremonial first kick in *robotic* outfit controlled by his brain
three doves were released before the match and bad things happened
@entity167 , @entity172 had to change plans for a scrimmage *due* to potential travel troubles
