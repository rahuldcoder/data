-- there are all sorts of ways to celebrate a successful harvest			1
in @entity7 of course , people commemorate the season 's bounty by giving thanks , overdosing on roast turkey , and turning on the tv to watch an endless parade of cartoon characters float about the streets of @entity16			0
but today 's @entity17 is not the only harvest festival on the cultural calendar			1
no matter the time of year , or place , a bounty of vegetables is often all it takes to get people singing , dancing , cow racing -- even parading around giant phalluses			2
to get in the spirit , we 've reaped some of the world 's most vibrant harvest festivals			2
@entity31 , @entity32 to some , a procession led by a 600 - pound wooden penis may seem a strange way to welcome the @entity36 , but in the small town of @entity38 , it 's only natural			1
@entity31 , or the fertility festival , is held every year on march 15 , and while the plethora of phalluses on display have made the event a popular go - to for tittering tourists , it is actually a @entity47 ritual meant to ensure a bountiful harvest in the coming months			1

during the festival , it is paraded by a troupe of @entity47 priests			1
in the lead - up to the main event , stalls serve up unending cups of saki to the crowd , and vendors hawk penis - shaped candies			2
the celebration ends with priests throwing out handfuls of mochi , or rice cakes , to anyone gathered in the shrine 's courtyard -- a practice meant to bring good luck for the following year			1
@entity78 's @entity77 , @entity79 for 125 years , the @entity81 harvest festival has had a troupe of shimmering mascots			1
the @entity85 -- deemed @entity87 's " second royal family " -- are renown for their dark suits emblazoned with hundreds of mother - of - pearl buttons , a tradition started by @entity92 , an orphan - turned - street sweeper			1
he first got the idea from costermongers , or street hawkers , who used to line the seams of their pants with pearl buttons found on the street			1
he took it a step further and coated his whole suit -- top hat and all			0
naturally , it was n't long before he was a popular @entity81 fixture ; he used his notoriety to raise money for various charities			2
each borough of @entity81 has its own @entity114 and @entity85 , and as a whole , the group functions mainly as a charitable organization			1
according to @entity119 , the @entity85 of @entity120 and @entity121 , charity and harvest go hand - in - hand			1

@entity153 -- a kind of " @entity155 " for @entity157 music -- is one of the festival 's most popular events , where finalists are judged for their savvy lyrics , content , melody and diction			1
like @entity148 's carnival , the costumes help make the event ( that , and copious amounts of rum ) , and prizes are given out for the most outrageous concoctions at the festival 's end			2
@entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 in @entity182 @entity181 communities , the prelude to the harvest coincides with a staple on the religious calendar -- @entity185 ( january 6 )			0
to celebrate the baptism of @entity188 , and to curry blessing for the coming season , the local bishop leads a procession to the nearest body of water , where he tosses a crucifix into the sea			0
volunteers ( mainly young men ) leap in after it and compete to be the first to catch it			0
