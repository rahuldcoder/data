-- the news this week might have made @entity2 roll over in his mummiform , his specially commissioned $ 40,000 bronze final resting place			1
@entity5 , a licensed funeral director , is in charge of mummification practices for @entity8			1
the founder of @entity8 , a small @entity10 - based spiritual group , died in january 2008 at age 63			1
that was after his community -- one that practices meditations and a modern form of mummification , makes its own sacramental wine and considers itself less of a religion than a way of life -- began to make national headlines with its journey to the @entity27			1
it began with a push to erect a monument listing @entity8 's seven guiding principles in a @entity10 municipal park that has long displayed a monument listing the @entity34			1
the @entity36 10th @entity35 in @entity37 , @entity38 , ruled in 2007 that free speech guarantees @entity8 the right to erect a monument			1
but the @entity27 unanimously agreed wednesday with the city of @entity43 , @entity10 , which argued that displays on public property , privately donated or otherwise , amount to " government speech " and fall under the discretion of local officials			1
beyond the headlines about what the ruling means to parks , 9/11 memorials and other monuments is an obscure group that wants recognition that its @entity8 are as valid as the @entity34			1
the aphorisms are the principles of psychokinesis , correspondence , vibration , opposition , rhythm , cause and effect , and gender			0
" a lot of people are so tired of being told how they have to worship , " said @entity67 , 58 , who has subscribed to @entity8 's teachings for more than 30 years			1
" it 's not about dogma ; it 's about becoming the best you can be			0
whatever path you discover that leads you in that direction , that 's where you need to be			0
" the group was founded in 1975 after @entity83 , who was raised in @entity84 , said he had encounters with " advanced beings , " which he chronicled in his book , " @entity8 : sealed except to the @entity88			1
" @entity83 legally changed his name to @entity90 , but still used the first name @entity92			0
to those who follow his teachings , the idea that @entity2 would be visited by some kind of higher power was no more far - fetched than any other religious leader 's claims			1
menu 's legal name is @entity101 , although the piano teacher professionally still goes by @entity103			0
what @entity2 gave to her was a better sense of , and appreciation for , herself , she said			2
she grew up in the @entity108 , in what she described as a very conservative @entity111 environment			0
" for a long time , i felt like a terrible person because i could n't worship and feel exactly like my parents , " she said thursday			0
@entity8 is " about an ongoing progression of the soul and discovery of that , of what 's in you			2
... it made me feel like i 'm ok , and i 've become a stronger person because of it			0
i do n't see how anybody can come to the conclusion that that 's bad			0
" @entity8 practitioners " believe in one source , " @entity67 said , " but we just do n't label it as @entity127			2
we just call it creation			0
we call it @entity8 , " which is a @entity130 term meaning " the sum total of all creation			2
" the community meets in a small copper - colored pyramid off @entity135 in @entity136 , and includes people of various religious backgrounds			1
tapping into @entity8 's teachings does not require anyone to give up ties to other faith traditions			2
the various religious texts -- including a copy of the @entity145 , the @entity146 and @entity147 -- found in the pyramid , as well as the multitude of @entity150 , are a testament to @entity8 's inclusion of any and all spiritual philosophies			1
also in the pyramid is a menagerie of mummified animals			2
some cats , including @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 , stand in row , across the room from @entity162 named @entity163 and @entity164 , as well as @entity67 's beloved poodle , @entity166 , who was mummified at a cost of about $ 12,000			0
the process devised by @entity8 preserves the body by soaking it in mummification fluids for at least 77 days before , among other things , slathering it with lanolin , wrapping it in gauze , painting it with multiple layers of butyl rubber and eventually sealing it in a mummiform			1
the process can take about six months to complete , and it is during this time that the soul of the living is guided into its next lifetime			0
about 1,500 people from across the globe , and from many different religions , have requested these mummification arrangements through their local funeral homes , said @entity5 , a licensed funeral director and longtime @entity8 practitioner			1
but so far only one , the @entity8 founder , has actually been mummified			1
an artist was commissioned to create @entity2 's mummiform , the face of which looks just like his			1
though he 's already sealed inside it , it is not yet on display in the pyramid			2
" we 're still working on the gold leaf , " @entity5 said thursday			0
" once that 's done , we 'll have him in there			0
" @entity8 does not require attendance or membership , so there is no way to know the number of adherents			2
menu estimated that " hundreds of thousands " of people across the globe have studied @entity8 's teachings , which are broadcast online , " but once they learn the meditations , they 're free to go live their own lives			2
" the meditations , of which there are many , are less about what is said than the way they make people feel , which is a good thing , because some are in a language unknown to @entity101 and other practitioners			0
there are those that are said in @entity229 , too , and then there is the @entity231 , which is less about words and more about actions between lovers			0
" we 're one humanity , but we all have our path and we all have our own experiences , " @entity67 said			0
" we 're just learning lessons this lifetime around			0
