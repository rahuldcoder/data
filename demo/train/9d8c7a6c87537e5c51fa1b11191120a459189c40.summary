" it was a crazy , tumbledown old house , abutting of course on the river , and literally overrun with rats ... the dirt and decay of the place rise up visibly before me , as if i were there again , " he later told his biographer , @entity70			0
both the warehouse and the stairs , near what is now embankment tube station , are long gone			0

@entity16 in @entity1 a century and a half of modernisation has meant that many of the locations in @entity1 ' novels no longer exist -- but eagle - eyed visitors can still catch a glimpse of the city as @entity8 or @entity160 would have recognized them			1

@entity161 also recommends the @entity232 pub in @entity233 , east @entity16			0
" it features in ' @entity235 , ' and feels very ' dickensian ' , overlooking the river , which was so important in his works , though of course these days it 's not as full of boats as it was in his day			0
" and across the river in @entity243 , @entity27 suggests the @entity244 , which was famed , in @entity1 ' day , for its whitebait suppers			0
