-- another victim of superstorm @entity3 's devastation in @entity5 : laboratory animals representing years of critical medical research			1
when the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) @entity10 lost power as @entity3 buffeted @entity5 on monday night , the back - up generators malfunctioned and the hospital was forced to evacuate around 300 patients to neighboring hospitals			1
the patients were saved , but the power outage left one of the medical center 's animal research facilities in the dark , and the @entity24 reported that thousands of laboratory mice may have drowned , resulting in the loss of years of research , cell cultures and tissues that had to be abandoned in failing incubators			1
the @entity29 , one of @entity9 's three animal research facilities , lost unique strains of mice when the power outage restricted access to the 13th floor research center , @entity28 reported			1
the center held specimens critical to @entity9 scientists ' research in heart disease , cancer and neurodegeneration			1
the center " was adversely impacted by the severity of the flood surge and the speed with which it came on , " according to a statement from the @entity10			0
" animal resource staff was on site continuously to mitigate the damage from the storm , but due to the speed and force of the surge , animal rescue attempts were unsuccessful			0
" @entity0 : lessons from storm @entity3 : when hospital generators fail dr. @entity60 , a cancer biologist at the center , told @entity28 that she and her colleagues were allowed into the lab to rescue whatever they could from the failing fridges			2
" we could lose everything we 've done since i started at @entity9 six years ago , " she told @entity28			1
" all the work we did , all the time and money , we 're going to have to start all over			0
" other @entity5 research institutions like the @entity71 did not lose power , nor valuable research , but the scientists sympathize with the @entity9 researchers ' loss			1
" we feel badly for the mice and for the science that was disrupted and the @entity71 is obviously committed to helping @entity9 scientists in this difficult time , " says @entity77 , the associate vice president and senior director at the @entity71 's @entity79 , which is involved in the care of the institute 's research animals			1
@entity0 : how disasters bring out our kindness as for what was comprised , @entity77 says that most institutions like @entity91 and @entity92 base their biomedical research on mice , since the animals are relatively easy to manipulate genetically			1
this makes them an ideal model for understanding the biology of human genetic defects			0
" when we modify mice to modify genes , those modifications made are unique to that specific mouse strain			1
that may be the only mouse strain that 's available for a specific genetic defect in the world , " says @entity77			2
" those mice are not replaceable , or they 're not very easy to replace			2
the effort to actually generate those mice is lost , and whatever science has been done on those mice is stopped			2
" not only is years worth of research potentially lost for the @entity9 scientists , but it will also take years to recover their work with new mice			1
to make new strains with the appropriate modifications can take anywhere from one to two years , and the researchers must breed a significant amount of the mice to replicate their studies			1
" it 's devastating , " says @entity77			0
" science is a very competitive field , and it is rapidly advancing			0
even reproducing those strains and having to wait to use them is devastating to their science because research advances very quickly			2
you can imagine that scientists ' lives are actually disrupted			0
" @entity0 : breast milk during the storm : with power gone , moms safeguard their stash for many researchers and students working on their doctorates and dissertations , their work and projects are now in jeopardy			2
without their specimens , researchers will have difficulty getting published and receiving grants for their work			0
as @entity156 reports , it is possible the @entity9 scientists shared their mice with other institutions who requested the mice for collaborative study , in which case some of the strains may be recovered in a relatively short time			1
however , @entity77 says for more recent and unpublished studies , this is unlikely			0
" before the science on these mice is published , there will not be as much sharing			0
i would guess that the majority of the mice were not shared with other investigators			0
therefore those mouse strains were lost , " he says			2
it 's possible that the @entity9 researchers preserved sperm and embryos from their lab mice , which could make recovering any unique strains slightly easier , but even that may take time and put the researchers further behind			1
the effects of @entity3 , it seems , will be felt long after the floods have receded and the power comes back on			0
@entity0 : @entity3 closed schools , but were officials too eager to cancel class ? this story was initially published on @entity0			0

mice representing years of research reportedly died as @entity9 hospital lost power
among the losses was a unique strain of mice critical to research
making new strains could take one to two years
