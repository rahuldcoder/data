@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 lost his sight in the @entity5 but the patriotic @entity6 is keen to serve his country again by helping to revive a @entity9 competition for blind golfers			1
blind golfer @entity11 with guide @entity12			1
former @entity14 was 22 when he was robbed of his vision in 1967 after a grenade explosion left him unable to see			0
@entity3 only occasionally played golf when he was younger			2
but when he lost his sight his interest in the sport really developed and he became involved in the development of the @entity6 @entity21			0
@entity3 is excited by the possibility of a return of blind golf 's version of the @entity9 , which was last contested in 1995			1
and as a former president of the @entity27 who now sits on the board of the @entity29 , @entity3 is hopeful the tournament can be revived			2
" i would love to see a @entity9 for blind golfers make a return			1
we had some great days back in the 1990s and played some great courses such as @entity34 , " he said			0
" the @entity9 itself is really popular and i think that matchplay in a team scenario is ideal for blind golf so bringing it back is something we should all work towards			1
" of course , there are different levels of blindness and provided that the criteria can be laid down -- which has caused some problems in the past -- then i think we could have a brilliant event on our hands			2
" @entity11 , of the @entity48 , agreed that there is interest in a @entity9 competition for blind golfers on his side of the @entity54			1
he added : " blind golf is really growing and expanding as a sport in @entity57 and further afield			1
i think there is a real appetite among the top players here to get some sort of match up between the @entity6 and @entity57 if at all possible			0
" we also have some of the best players , including current world champion @entity66 , so it would be a really good contest			0
if something can be sorted out that would be brilliant , " he finished			0
blind or partially sighted golfers have a sighted coach who assists the golfer in describing distance , direction and characteristics of the hole , and helps with club head alignment behind the ball , prior to the stroke			1
from this point , the golfer is on their own , and it is their skill that determines the resulting stroke			2
other than the coach , there is only one relaxation to the @entity85 : blind or partially sighted golfers are allowed to ground their club in a hazard			2
@entity3 , who lives in @entity88 , revealed that blind golfers use several techniques to aid them just before they make the shot			1
" some golfers like to visualize what the whole looks like and get as much information as possible from the sighted coach to try and paint a picture in their mind of what the layout of the hole might be , " he told @entity2			1
" but i prefer to play the numbers game			0
what is the par for hole ? what is the length of the hole ? once i know these things i can calculate the power needed for my shots and pretty much know how far i need to hit the ball and which club i need			0
" without doubt , putting is the most difficult -- i try to read the contour of the greens through my shoes to get a feel for how hard i have to hit the ball , whether there is a gradient et cetera , " @entity3 explained			2
" a lot of the time , with advice from the coach , blind golfers can make it to the greens in more or less the same number of shots as sighted players , " he said			1
" most of the golf i play is against players who have full vision			0
and let me tell you they do n't cut me any slack whatsoever -- not a single stroke -- especially if the loser buys the beer ! " he joked			0
while the sighted coach is essential to the blind golfer , having an extra person can also bring a fresh set of problems			1
" sometimes having a coach can overcomplicate things for you with the amount of information and often when they leave stuff out it can actually help you , " @entity3 explained			2
" for example , i would hit over a lake easier if i did n't know i was doing so -- but if i know it is there then all of a sudden it puts more pressure on you , " he said			0
" the other thing is that you are playing as part of a team , " he continued			0
" you might be on fire and playing the best golf of your life but if the other part of that team is having a bad day it can mean you do n't shoot the score you want			0

@entity5 *veteran* @entity3 is keen to revive a @entity9 for blind golfers
blind golfers usually have a sighted coach who advises them on shots
there are relatively few differences between blind golf and *conventional* golf
@entity0 blind golfer @entity11 would also welcome a return of the event
