for years , @entity0 has talked about promoting " green growth			1
" but this probably is n't what they had in mind			0
for the seventh year in a row , monstrous quantities of green algae known as enteromorpha prolifera have sprouted in the coastal waters near @entity11 , @entity0			1
but this year 's growth , covering 28,900 square kilometers ( 11,158 square miles ) , is the biggest outbreak ever recorded , state - run news agency @entity12 reported			1
the previous record was 13,000 square kilometers ( 5019 square miles ) in 2008			1
swimmers and beachgoers were pictured frolicking among the stringy piles of slime , while bulldozers attempted to scoop it away			0
@entity0 officials have blamed past algae outbreaks on unusually warm seas			1
dr. @entity25 , an algae expert at the @entity26 , says the explanation does n't hold water			1
" you may get faster growth rates with higher temperatures , but you ca n't get such large amounts of biomass without access to nutrients , " he explained			0
according to @entity25 , massive algae blooms feed off of high levels of nitrites and phosphates in the water , which typically comes from agricultural waste , industrial pollution , or human sewage from highly populated areas			1
@entity45 is " fairly benign , " said @entity25 , but can harm marine ecosystems			0
algae blocks sunlight from reaching aquatic life , reduces oxygen levels , and emits bacteria when the algae dies and rots			2
similar but more dangerous types of aquatic growths , such as phytobacteria or dinoflagellates , can produce harmful toxins and posion people			2
" they should consider themselves quite lucky that it 's not one of those , " said @entity25			0
@entity0 state media reported that the seaweed began proliferating on june 5 , and that local governments had " taken measures " to minimize the impact to marine ecosystems			2
officials reported that they had removed around 7,335 tons of algae			1
@entity25 said enteromorpha typically does not cause health problems in humans , but " large concentrations of anything can be problematic			2
" there could be a risk of skin inflammation , said @entity25			0
" if you were stupid enough to go in , i would n't go in naked			0
" in 2012 : melting @entity83 ' blooms ' with algae			0

coastal waters near @entity11 covered with 28,900 sq km of green algae
largest outbreak seen by local officials , *doubling* previous record in 2008
**scientist** says algae is caused by pollution and sewage in water
algae ' generally not harmful ' to humans , but **scientist** urges *caution*
