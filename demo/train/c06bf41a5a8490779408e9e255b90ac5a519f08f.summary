with the intent of undermining the market for illegal drugs , @entity1 's government presented a bill to lawmakers that would legalize marijuana under a government monopoly			1
the government of president @entity10 has argued that the war on drugs has failed , and that separating the market for marijuana from the market for harder drugs will have social and health benefits			2
the bill was presented to congress on wednesday , and includes no details of how legalization would be cultivated , regulated or sold			2
but it makes it clear that the government would be the sole manager of the " importation , production , acquisition ... commercialization and distribution of marijuana or its derivatives			2
" the idea was first announced in june , and at the time there were reports that such a law would require onerous identification and tracking requirements that consumers would object to			0
read more about how @entity37 is fighting the war on drugs the bill does not mention any requirements , presumably leaving it up to the congress to fill in the details			0
@entity45 , pro-secretary of the presidency , said that current laws criminalizing the private sale of marijuana would remain in place , and campaigns warning of dangers of drug use would continue			0
" no one is saying that marijuana is good			0
what is happening is that the foundation of the type of policy that we have followed for more than 50 years in this country have not had the expected results , and the worst thing that can happen to public policy is to not act when the evidence shows that persisting on the same path will not obtain different results , " he said			0
consumption of marijuana is already legal in @entity1 , @entity45 said			1
if passed , the law would make @entity1 the first country to produce and sell marijuana to its citizens			1
while the bill itself was short on details of how such a system would actually work , it was accompanied by a 12 - page letter that carefully laid out the argument for passage of the bill			1
the goal is to create a government - run market that would " contribute to the reduction of risks and potential dangers that people who use marijuana for recreation or medical reasons face			2
" read : is @entity92 the forgotten front in @entity95 's drug war ? marijuana users put themselves in dangerous situations in the course of acquiring the substance , and expose themselves to other drugs that are more addictive and dangerous , the letter states			0
the letter traces the history of drug use to pre-columbian times , but focuses on the drug war of the last 50 years			0
the war on drugs has failed and had consequences that are worse than the drugs themselves , the letter states			0
as evidence , the @entity1 government points to a report last year by the @entity115 , a body made up of several former presidents and other luminaries , who concluded that the war on drugs has failed to accomplish the goals it set			1
@entity1 will not abandon its policy of combating drugs , but will do so through education of the harmful effects , rather than criminalization for marijuana , the letter states			1
marijuana is the most commonly used illegal substance in @entity1 , and drug traffickers net $ 30 - 40 million annual from the black market , the government said .			1
