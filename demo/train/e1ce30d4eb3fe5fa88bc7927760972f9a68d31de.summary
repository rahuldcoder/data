-- a day after a @entity4 guest house was pummeled online for its policy of fining wedding parties for negative online reviews , its owner has apologized			1
hundreds of people took to @entity9 on monday to complain about the @entity11 's policy of fining wedding parties $ 500 for any negative online reviews posted by members of their groups			1
@entity11 owner @entity17 admitted the fine was a company policy , but it is n't anymore			1
although it had been removed from the website by monday afternoon , screen shots show the policy read as follows : " ( @entity25 ) here will be a $ 500 fine that will be deducted from your deposit for every negative review of @entity11 placed on any internet site by anyone in your party and / or attending your wedding or event			1
" it was intended as a joke , " never something i told employees to enforce , " @entity17 wrote on the hotel 's @entity41 page			0
" however , since it was listed on our website it did represent an official policy			0
i now realize this joke was made in poor taste and not at all funny			2
this is no longer a policy of @entity11 and we have taken it off of our website			2
" he cited his inexperience with the @entity52 and digital communication as one of the reasons he made the mistake			0
but a previous guest says the hotel has a history of trying to enforce the policy and ignoring other guest complaints			0
guests who mention the @entity41 apology letter will get a 10 % discount on stays at the guest house within the next three months , @entity17 wrote .			0
