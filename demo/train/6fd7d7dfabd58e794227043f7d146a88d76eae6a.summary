-- it is a noise that has become synonymous with watching top - level tennis -- the sound of ear - splitting shrieks and grunts as star players battle against each other in a bid to claim the sport 's biggest prizes			1
the yelps of three - time grand slam champion @entity12 and world no. 3 @entity13 have been the source of much conversation this week at the @entity17 in @entity18 -- the year 's first grand slam			1
it might reach a crescendo on saturday when they meet in the women 's final , with the no. 1 ranking also at stake			2
" about @entity12 , i mean , what can i say ? " said eighth seed @entity26 in a press conference following her quarterfinal defeat to @entity30 ' @entity13 on tuesday			1
" for sure that is pretty annoying and it 's just too loud			2
" who will be 2012 @entity17 victors ? throughout her career -- which has included reaching no. 1 in the world , a breakthrough win aged 17 at @entity40 in 2004 and two further grand slam titles -- @entity12 has been renowned for the volume of her on - court vocalizations			1
" i 've heard it a few times over my career , " the 24 - year - old @entity44 said			0
" you 've watched me grow up , you 've watched me play tennis			0
" i 've been the same over the course of my career			0
no one important enough has told me to change or do something different			0
" right now there is no rule change			0
i do n't hear that there will be one , so it does n't really matter what my answer would be , would it ? " at present , there are no @entity60 rules which directly prohibit grunting			1
female tennis ' governing body does , however , have regulations which outlaw hindrances			0
rivals reunited : @entity66 faces @entity12 in semis an involuntary hindrance would cover a player 's hat falling off , or a ball rolling from their pocket			1
in this instance , a let is called and the point is replayed			0
any hindrance deemed deliberate by the umpire would result in the loss of a point			0
although the issue of grunting is not mentioned in the @entity84 's 2012 rulebook , the @entity60 explained how they are attempting to coach the trait out of the next generation of players			1
" everyone who watches tennis knows grunting is a part of the game , and we are aware that some fans find it bothersome , " read a @entity60 statement			1
" we are currently in the process of exploring how to reduce excessive grunting , especially for younger players just starting out , without adversely affecting players who have developed their game under the current training " we do believe that we need to address the concerns expressed by some fans and take a careful look at our rules and education policies			1
" @entity107 's @entity106 retired in 2007 after a 13 - year playing career which saw her claim five grand slam titles , including three successive @entity17 triumphs between 1997 and 1999			1
the former world no. 1 , who is playing in the senior 's event in @entity18 , said the noises were more irksome for fans and viewers and largely go unnoticed by players			1
@entity118 downplays injury scare ahead of @entity121 rematch but @entity106 did admit to being baffled by some of the noises coming from the opposite end of the court			2
" it 's just sometimes when they were stretching a little bit more , you 're like : ' what are you doing ? ' the more they had to stretch the louder it got , " the 31 - year - old explained			2
" or sometimes it 's like a heavy grunt and it 's on the service line and the ball does n't have any weight on it			2
but i think it 's more of an issue with the spectators			2
" due to the volume and unique nature of world @entity151 's screams , the @entity146 crowd took to mimicking her during a second round win over @entity154 @entity153			1
" of course i hear it			0
i mean , i 'm not deaf , " the 22 - year - old joked			0
" but it 's fine for me			0
i mean , i respect the crowd , whatever they do			0
i try to just be focused on my game			0
" so , with the @entity60 focused on coaching grunting out of the next generation of talent , it looks as if opponents of @entity12 and @entity13 will have to put up with the deafening screams for the foreseeable future			1
or start wearing ear plugs ...			0
