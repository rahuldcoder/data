-- imagine a world in which every major company in @entity3 flew hundreds of thousands of drones overhead , 24 hours a day , seven days a week , 365 days a year , collecting data on what @entity3 were doing down below			1
it 's a chilling thought that would engender howls of outrage			1
now imagine that millions of @entity3 walk around each day wearing the equivalent of a drone on their head : a device capable of capturing video and audio recordings of everything that happens around them			1
and imagine that these devices upload the data to large - scale commercial enterprises that are able to collect the recordings from each and every @entity3 and integrate them together to form a minute - by - minute tracking of the activities of millions			1
that is almost precisely the vision of the future that lies directly ahead of us			0
not , of course , with wearable drones but with wearable @entity33 - connected equipment			1
this new technology -- whether in the form of glasses or watches -- may unobtrusively capture video data in real time , store it in the cloud and allow for it to be analyzed			1
the pros and cons of surveillance cameras some will say these new devices are no different from existing technology , like handheld video cameras or iphones with audio recording functions			1
but there 's a huge distinction			0
the emerging new technology is not designed with significant storage capacity			0
instead , its default mode is for all data to be automatically uploaded to cloud servers , where aggregation and back - end analytic capacity resides			2
so , who owns and what happens to the user 's data ? can the entire database be mined and analyzed for commercial purposes ? what rules will apply when law enforcement seeks access to the data for a criminal or national security investigation ? for how long will the data be retained ? as some members of the @entity76 recognized last year when they considered the use of only a single stream of data -- gps location -- creating a life stream of data points paints a mosaic picture of a person 's actions and habits			2
who owns that mosaic ? service providers may argue that the terms of service approved by customers will set limitations on how their collected data can be used			2
but even if customers can truly make informed decisions about the storage and handling of such data , they have no right to consent to the use of data that is collected about passersbys whom they record , intentionally or not			1
snap a photo by winking your eye ? ubiquitous street video streaming will capture images of many people who have n't volunteered to have their images collected , collated and analyzed			0
even those who might be willing to forgo some degree of privacy to enhance national security should be concerned about a corporate @entity3 that will have an unrestricted continuous video record of millions			1
what is to prevent a corporation from targeting a particular individual , using face recognition technology to assemble all uploaded videos in which he appears , and effectively constructing a surveillance record that can be used to analyze his life ? opinion : surveillance state no answer to terror concerns like this have motivated at least one bar owner to ban @entity132 from the premises			2
the proprietor thinks that continuous observation of patrons in the bar will strip them of their anonymity and put a damper on their spontaneity			0
in other words , why go to a bar when someone there is wearing a device that may be recording your every bad joke after you 've had too many drinks ? maybe the market can take care of this problem			0
but the likely pervasiveness of this type of technology convinces me that government must play a regulatory role			0
before we get too far down this road of ubiquitous surveillance , real - time upload and comprehensive analytics by cloud providers , we should pause to consider the implications			0
we need to consider what rights consumers have , and what rights nonparticipant third parties should have			0
we need to be judicious in how to balance innovation with privacy			0
the @entity171 and @entity172 need to take a look at this new technology before it becomes common			0
the new data collection platforms right in front of us are much more likely to affect our lives than is the prospect of drones overhead surveilling @entity3 citizens			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			2

@entity183 : a world in which drones *fly* overhead 24/7 is a chilling thought
@entity183 : imagine wearing the equivalent of a surveillance drone on your head everyday
he says instead of wearable drones , we will have wearable glasses or watches
@entity183 : these devices can record and store *valuable* data about us ; will we lose privacy ?
