-- a former @entity2 judge is standing trial on charges he checked male inmates out of jail and forced them to engage in sexual activity such as paddling in exchange for leniency			1
former @entity12 circuit judge @entity11 denies all the charges , his attorney says			1
former @entity12 circuit judge @entity11 at one point faced more than 100 criminal counts in the case , including kidnapping , sexual abuse , extortion and sodomy			1
prosecutors filed cases relating to 15 alleged victims , with multiple counts in each case			1
but four of those cases have been dismissed -- some thrown out by a judge because the statute of limitations expired and others because prosecutors decided not to present evidence relating to them -- leaving 11 alleged victims and 51 counts , according to defense attorney @entity34 and @entity0 affiliate @entity35			1
retired @entity37 judge @entity36 dismissed jurors tuesday while attorneys argued whether the jury should be allowed to consider kidnapping , extortion or assault charges , @entity35 reported			1
@entity36 already has ruled there is enough evidence for jurors to consider the sex abuse charges			0
@entity11 , 48 , has pleaded not guilty and has denied any wrongdoing			1

" one of the alleged victims testified monday that he does n't know why his semen was found on the carpet of a small room used as an office by @entity11 , according to the @entity68 newspaper			1
but he did say @entity11 spanked him with a belt on several occasions , the newspaper reported , and that the paddlings took place inside a jury room , in the small office and at a @entity12 fraternity house			1
another man testified that after he was charged with kidnapping and robbery in 2002 , @entity11 visited him in jail and urged the man to let @entity11 decide the case instead of a jury , according to the @entity68			2
@entity11 convicted him of lesser charges , he testified , and sentenced him to a 90 - day boot camp			2

" all of them [ the alleged victims ] were given preferential treatment at some point , " @entity91 , chief assistant district attorney for @entity12 , told @entity0 earlier this month			1
" and ultimately , when some of them refused to continue participating [ in the activities ] , they were given what i would view as excessive sentences			0
but certainly while the inmates were involved with the activities we allege , the state would say , it was extremely lenient sentences			2
" however , " two of the individuals said he [ @entity11 ] did nothing bad to them , " @entity34 said tuesday			2
" that he did n't paddle them			0
that he only helped them			0

@entity11 resigned from the bench in october 2007 before he was scheduled to stand trial before the @entity135 on multiple ethics violations charges			2
the complaint , dismissed after the resignation , accused him of " extrajudiciary personal contact " with some defendants but does not refer to any sexual contact			2
in april , @entity11 told @entity35 the allegations against him are false , but the most important thing for him was making sure his wife and two daughters were taken care of			1
