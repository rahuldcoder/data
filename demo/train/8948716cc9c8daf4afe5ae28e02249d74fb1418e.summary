@entity6 , @entity7 -- " we did not have a right to choose where we lived ... freedom of speech , or freedom of actions			0
the traffickers had keys to our apartment			0
they controlled all of our movement and travel			0
they watched us and listened when we called our parents			0
they did n't let us make friends or tell anyone anything about ourselves			0
we could n't keep any of the money we earned			0
we could n't ask anyone for help			0
" -- @entity23 @entity23 was an athletic student from @entity24 yearning to visit the @entity25 through a study - abroad program at her college			1
she had visions of learning @entity29 and returning home to share her experiences with her family			0
but the human traffickers who ensnared her had a different vision for @entity23 , shipping her to @entity25 and exploiting her in the sex industry for profit			1
they met her at the airport with news that her study abroad placement had been changed			0
she was given new bus tickets and sent off to @entity41 , @entity7			0
once there they took her passport and her freedom			0
after almost a year of enslavement , @entity23 risked her life to make a daring escape			0
she is smart , resilient and funny , and i have been honored to be her attorney through the @entity51 at the @entity52			0
unfortunately there are thousands of adults and children like @entity23 who have not been able to escape their traffickers			0
these victims , especially the children , are in the same position @entity23 was : they 're being exploited and ca n't ask anyone for help			2
the data on human trafficking is sparse , but what is known is terrifying			2
it 's already the second largest criminal industry in the world -- behind only the trade in illegal drugs -- and it 's growing fast			2
the global commercial sex trade exploits one million children annually			1
at least 100,000 and perhaps as many as 300,000 children in @entity25 are victims of sex trafficking each year			1
the grim reality of child sex trafficking in the @entity25 is this : human traffickers are selling sex with children in big cities and small towns throughout @entity25			1
child sex trafficking has been illegal in the @entity25 since 2000 with the passage of the @entity81			1
under this law it is illegal to recruit , harbor , transport , provide or obtain a person under the age of 18 years for the purpose of a commercial sex act			2
since the passage of the @entity81 many states have passed their own human trafficking laws			2
children who are selling sex in the @entity25 are then , by definition , victims of human trafficking			1
despite this , child victims of sex trafficking are frequently viewed as criminals rather than as victims			1
according to the @entity105 in 2006 , six years after the passage of the @entity81 , 1,600 children were arrested for prostitution and commercialized vice			0
the children victimized by sex trafficking are often very young			1
on average , girls are first exploited for commercial sex between the ages of 12 and 14			2
for boys the average age is even younger -- between 11 and 13			0
but being a victim of sex trafficking does not have to be a life sentence			1
victims can become survivors and build new lives			2
and while @entity23 is no longer the young college student she once was and it is too dangerous for her to return home , her speech and actions are now her own			0
she can choose where she wants to live			0
through my work with @entity23 and other clients in the @entity51 we have identified a number of ways to fight sex trafficking			1
raise awareness within your community : one of the biggest barriers to helping victims of sex trafficking is the lack of awareness about the issue			1
human traffickers profit when we think human trafficking only happens in foreign countries			2
human trafficking happens everywhere , and sex trafficking cases involving children have been found in all regions of the country			1
no community is immune to the horrors of human trafficking			2
communities must prioritize the fight against human trafficking -- including providing enough resources to law enforcement			1
change the conversation : children who by law are too young to consent to having sex obviously can not consent to selling sex , so : victims should not be described as entering into prostitution ; they are being exploited and should be described as victims of human trafficking			1
law enforcement officials often arrest and detain child victims of sex trafficking on either prostitution charges or other charges , such as truancy or curfew violations			1
law enforcement must be trained about human trafficking			2
sellers of sex , especially when they are children , should not be guilty of a criminal violation			0
buyers and pimps should be the only individuals at risk of criminal penalties			0
this would ensure that no victims are arrested or jailed			0
reduce demand : the reality of sex trafficking must not be neutralized or glamorized			1
individuals who travel abroad to purchase sex from children are demonized in the media and identified as sexual predators , yet individuals who stay in the @entity25 and pay to have sex with children are given the anonymous title " john " -- and frequently are n't even charged with a crime			1
individuals who pay for sex with children in the @entity25 should be punished			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			1

@entity205 says sex trafficking *thrives* in @entity25 communities
victims of sex trade are often *wrongly* viewed as criminals , she says
@entity205 : to fight trafficking , communities must become aware , reduce demand
