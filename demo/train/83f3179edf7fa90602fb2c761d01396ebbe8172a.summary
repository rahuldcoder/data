the @entity0 on wednesday announced disturbing decisions on two important cases regarding marriage law , but the high court refused to create a constitutional right to same - sex marriage			1
in striking down @entity8 of the federal @entity9 , the court declared that the federal government ca n't define marriage as the union of one man and one woman for its own policies and laws but must accept whatever the states decide about marriage			1
the court 's ruling , though , does n't affect @entity21 , which provides that no state is required to give effect to another state 's recognition of same - sex marriages			2
the court got it wrong with @entity9			0
the justices ignored the votes of large , bipartisan majorities in @entity32 in 1996			0
it is absurd for the court to suggest that @entity32 does n't have the power to define the meaning of words in statutes that @entity32 itself enacts			0
this is a serious loss for federalism and democratic self - government			0
we must work to reverse it -- and to defend the rights of all @entity46 to make marriage policy			0
in its ruling on @entity50 's @entity49 ( which defined marriage in that state as the union of one man and one woman ) , the @entity0 declared that the citizen group that sponsored the initiative did n't have standing to defend the state constitutional amendment that millions of @entity50 voted to pass			1
the only reason this jurisdiction question was an issue is because the governor and attorney general of @entity50 decided to not defend a law passed by the people			2
although the government of @entity50 through inaction tried to silence the voices of @entity50 , the court did n't create a right to redefine marriage			1
marriage laws in the states that tell the truth about marriage -- that it is a union of one man and one woman to provide children with a mom and a dad -- were not struck down			1
we must now work to protect marriage laws in 37 other states .			0
