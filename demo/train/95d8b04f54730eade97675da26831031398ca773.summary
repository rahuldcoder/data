-- " @entity5 " is the latest in what seems to be a never - ending trend of treating a biopic as being compelling and interesting simply because the subject may be			2
the thing is , films do n't work that way and while @entity9 was indeed a fascinating man and important in our country 's history , @entity14 's film from a script by @entity16 ( " milk " ) is dull from start to finish and often bears little resemblance to the truth			1
let 's be clear about one thing up front : @entity9 was a bad guy			1
he was a power - obsessed , racist paranoid with little concern for the working people , immigrants or ethnic minorities that helped build this country			0
he was the perfect example of someone who believed that in order to protect the @entity33 , he was entitled to shred the document on which the country was founded , the @entity33 @entity36			0
how or more importantly , why , those virtually undisputed facts were twisted into the mockery of history that is @entity14 's " @entity5 " is anyone 's guess			2
it is , quite simply , a poorly conceived and constructed film			1
the through line , if you can call it that , is @entity9 's narration of his so - called memoirs to a series of @entity52 agents tasked with taking his dictation , each segment of which leads us to a chapter in @entity9 's life			1
his goal is clearly not to represent history -- since much of what he tells the agents is patently untrue -- and more to cement his own legacy as he sees it : a crusading champion of truth ( yeah , right ) justice ( haw ! ) and the " @entity65			0
" the problem is , there are also scenes in the film that are not part of his memoirs and at times it 's hard to tell the difference between the first person and third person			1
considering the film 's length , there 's a good chance audiences will stop caring at some point			1
@entity0 photos : historical images of @entity9 blurred political history notwithstanding , " @entity9 " is so boring as to give tedium a bad name			1
there 's no beginning - middle - end -- and while that 's not necessarily an issue in and of itself , something has to replace that traditional structure			2
here it 's an endless stream of flash - forwards and flashbacks of young @entity9 , old @entity9 , young @entity9 again , not - so - young - as - young @entity9 , middle - aged @entity9 , gay @entity9 , momma 's boy @entity9 , dictating @entity9			1
it 's enough to make you dizzy			0
@entity100 is at less than his best as the rather unattractive @entity101 and his accent is needless			0
@entity9 was from @entity103 and no one cares what he sounded like			1
add that to his nervous tics , strange speech patterns and barely hidden stutter and it 's hard to see the forest for the trees , as it were			0
@entity14 prides himself on bringing in films on time and under budget and perhaps that 's why the old age makeup was so dreadful			0
considering the advances in modern cinema makeup , i ca n't see any other reason			1
in portraying @entity9 's long - time companion @entity124 , @entity123 looks like a burn victim in his later years			1
the thing is , @entity9 was an interesting character and his story could make ( and maybe has made ) for a compelling literary biography			1
a film , however , has to have some sort of dramatic structure or tension			0
the audience needs either someone to root for -- or in this case , against -- and @entity14 and @entity16 do n't give this to us			0
a perfect example of what could have been done is @entity142 's exceptional 2005 film " @entity148 , " where @entity142 and co-writer @entity143 took the unvarnished villainy of sen. @entity145 and crafted a compelling human drama around the bad guy			1
granted , it was n't billed as a biography of @entity145 , but perhaps that 's the point			2
an argument can be made that living your life as a self - loathing closeted homosexual , a life which @entity9 has been accused of living , can turn anyone into an unpleasant , unhappy , angry person and let 's for a moment assume that the theories about @entity9 's closeted homosexuality are true			1
add to them what we know as fact about the man : anti-communist , anti-labor , racist , momma 's boy , socially awkward , former stutterer , paranoid , and power - hungry proponent of " the ends justify the means			0
" there you have an incredibly complex man and while the movie touches on many of these aspects , they leave it at that			0
it 's like offering someone a steak without mentioning the cut , accompaniments , quality of the meat , cooking method , etc. while @entity9 is shown trying to blackmail everyone from @entity194 to @entity195 and routinely circumventing the law , these are not portrayed as particularly bad things to do			1
nor , it must be said , are they shown to be good things			0
therein lies the film 's major problem			2
it refuses to take any position on @entity205 , resulting in an overlong and uninteresting slog			2
the old saying that there are two sides to every story is simply not true			0
@entity9 was not an ambiguous villain			2
rather he could be viewed as a despicable man who ruined the lives of many good people and may have caused the deaths of many of his so - called enemies			0
he routinely broke the law and exceeded his mandate under the guise of protecting @entity33			0
it 's too bad that one of modern cinema 's great master filmmakers could n't do more with such a compelling character and important part of this country 's history			1
skip this and watch the aforementioned @entity142 film again			0
" @entity5 " is rated @entity231 i assume this is for strong language , as there 's nothing else in the film that would warrant the rating			2
the film opens in limited release today and wide release on friday .			0

it is , quite simply , a poorly conceived and constructed film
the film refuses to take any position on @entity9 whatsoever
it 's too bad that one of modern cinema 's great master filmmakers could n't do more
