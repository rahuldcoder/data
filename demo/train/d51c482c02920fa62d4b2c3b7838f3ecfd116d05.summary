-- a federal judge has ordered the @entity3 administration to release 28 videotapes purportedly showing forced feedings and other confinement measures of detainees at the @entity9 facility in @entity10			1
judge @entity11 ruled friday the tapes can be released with modifications -- such as blurring faces -- to address the government 's concerns over identifying guards , uniforms , and written materials on walls			2
" given what is already available to the public and known to the detainees , it simply is not plausible to argue that release of the videos will give rise to an additional probability of harm by encouraging the development of @entity31 [ forced cell extractions ] countermeasures , " @entity11 said in the ruling			0
lawyers for a @entity36 man held at @entity9 since 2002 , whose approved release is still pending , were lobbying for the release of the videos ahead of a hearing scheduled for monday			2
@entity40 , 43 , has been on numerous hunger strikes while in detention			0
he and his lawyers are seeking a preliminary injunction preventing detention facility officials from forced cell extractions [ @entity31 ] , and placing him in a so - called restraint chair used for forced feedings			1
@entity51 nurse wo n't force - feed @entity9 detainees the method is designed to provide liquid nutrition and medicine via a tube inserted in the nose directly into the stomach			1
several media organizations -- including the @entity60 , @entity61 , the @entity62 and @entity63 -- had also filed a separate brief urging the release of the tapes , which show forced feedings of @entity40 and others			1
the @entity69 had expressed concern about national security or other sensitive information being inadvertently revealed in open court and requested a closed hearing , but @entity11 strongly dismissed the arguments and denied the request			0
" this court has full faith in the ability of counsel and the court , acting together , to handle in an efficient and appropriate manner , all the classified and protected information , " @entity11 wrote in a thursday ruling			0
" moreover , a reasonable amount of delay and logistical burdens are a small price to pay for the virtues of judicial transparency			0
" the government will likely appeal , meaning it 's unlikely the videotapes will be released anytime soon			1
the case is @entity95 ( 1:05 - cv - 1457 ) .			0
