@entity3 , @entity1 it 's a heart - pounding climb up a dark , piss - drenched stairwell			1
the greasy iron elevator that services the flaking 1920s apartment building seems to function only intermittently			2
a small group of @entity11 tourists is trapped inside			2
the bargain - priced apartment they 've been renting maybe does n't seem like such a good deal now			1
there 's no word of when a maintenance engineer will show up or even if such a person exists			2
this is clearly no intellectual 's ivory tower			2
and that 's just the way @entity1 author @entity23 likes it			1
" up here , i 'm like a ghost			2
i 've been a privileged witness to what has gone on in the neighborhood , " he told me on a recent visit to his home			2
@entity23 has been living on the top floor for more than 30 years now			1
he 's transformed a small roof terrace into his own observation platform -- to peer down on what he calls @entity3 's " dirty " reality			1
these days , @entity23 says he 's turned to @entity38 to beat his addictions to cheap rum and wild sex			1
up in his ninth - floor sanctuary , he 's just about out of harm 's way			1
but one teeter and he may just fall -- he says maybe he 'll join me for a " small drink " down at ground level in the next few days			2
@entity23 has rarely been so clean living			1
he says he 's spent most of the last three decades prowling the streets and alleys below			2
" things are continually happening down there			1
pornographic , erotic , sociological and anthropological happenings , " he explained , wide - eyed			1
@entity23 's almost 20 works of prose and poetry are foul - mouthed , cynical and scathing			1
the kinder literary critics have dubbed him the pioneer of " dirty realism			2
" his worst critics have condemned him as a crude pornographer -- for example , before you even finish the first page of his acclaimed " @entity64 of @entity3 , " there are graphic sexual scenes			2
" some people accuse me of exaggerating , but i say no ! the reality is excessive			1
i have to tone things down to make it believable			1
it 's a very brutal , violent reality , and in order to make it credible , you have to tone it down a bit , " he says			1
" but i am interested in ugliness , the ethics and the aesthetics of the ' dirty ones , ' the poorest people who live right on the edge , " he adds			1
his bleakest works are centered on the 1990s , during @entity1 's so - called @entity84			1
that was just after the @entity86 collapsed , leaving its @entity88 ally @entity1 to economic wrack and ruin , devoid of subsidies or a market for its goods			1
but @entity23 says not a lot has improved since then , at least in @entity3 and @entity95			1
" everything has stayed the same here			0
the same poverty , the same misery the same people who are just survivors , " he said			0
" i write about people surviving on the limits			0
" jabbing his finger into the afternoon sun , @entity23 points out @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 , the four streets that he says once formed @entity1 's largest red light district , before the @entity110			1
he suggests that prostitution , migration from the countryside to the capital and the disintegration of extended families are the root causes of the chaos he says still reigns in this area			0
" there were hundreds or thousands of hookers down there			0
the people left there today are the daughters and the granddaughters of the hookers			0
that 's important to note in social terms			0
this was never a normal neighborhood , " he explained with a grin			0
@entity23 worked for 26 years as a journalist for state - run newspapers and magazines			1
but when he began publishing his crude and critical brand of fiction , he was fired			1
he 's pushed the boundaries of free speech in @entity1 but has never been jailed for speaking his mind			1
he seems to have little intention of keeping quiet			0
" i 'm soon going to be 65			0
i have to take advantage of those years to say what i have to say			0
people do n't dare ; they just die with their mouths shut			0
when you have ideas , you have to express them , " @entity23 said			1
his literary depiction of his neighbors here in @entity3 may seem harsh			1
but walking the streets , you can quickly see he may have a valid point			0
a few doors from his apartment building , there 's the entrance to the local @entity160 , a neighborhood group set up to promote the values of the revolution			0
on the door , a black - and - white photo of a young @entity165			1
diagonally opposite is a small store with welded bars at the window			0
the only thing inside , a huge vat of white rum			0
a half measure sells for 40 cents and a full 750 ml goes for 80 cents			0
it was only mid-morning , but a man rooted through the trash outside , pulled out a small plastic bottle and with trembling hands asked for a fill - up			2
that surely can not be what @entity165 -- enshrined in the poster across the street -- had in mind : a land where tourists drink mint - filled mojitos while a few blocks away , an alcoholic worker knocks back a huge slug of " train sparks , " the name @entity185 colloquially give to cheap , industrial - strength rum			2
" this neighborhood always was on the margins of all the talk of revolutionary ideals			0
maybe in the ' 70s and ' 80s , when there was some kind of revolutionary pride , it was a little different			0
but generally , people stayed on the sidelines , " @entity23 told me			1
while his works are bitingly critical of the decades - long social breakdown in his neighborhood , his overall outlook on life and the @entity1 system is more nuanced			1
when @entity165 and his rebels seized power in 1959 , @entity23 was 7 years old , selling ice cream on @entity3 's streets			1
he recalls the brutality of the outgoing dictatorship of general @entity217 and the celebrations and hopes for newfound freedom ushered in by the rebel forces			0
" there was a lot of joy in the first few days			0
it was like freedom had arrived , " he said			0
despite the experiences of the decades since then , @entity23 says he still considers himself a " romantic " leftist			1
he rejects suggestions that he has anything in common with @entity1 's right - wing dissident movement			1
" i think ( the regime ) is trying to save the good things of socialism and the revolution like education , health and national pride			2
we still have to advance a great deal in human rights and personal freedoms , " he added			0
for some of @entity23 's neighbors , change can not come fast enough			1
it 's past midnight in a dive bar on @entity245			0
a washed - up boxer , @entity246 , croons along to a salsa tune on the tv , then asks for a double - strength rum and coke			2
he says he was a bantamweight @entity251 and @entity252 champion			0
when it comes to boxers , @entity1 has proved itself to be in a sporting class of its own			1
but now 50 , @entity246 has little left to show for his glory years except for a nose like a lump of rubber -- broken so many times , he has no cartilage left			0
in a hotel bar , a few doors down , on @entity3 's @entity265 waterfront , a 33 - year - old woman clad in leopard - print hot pants sips on a @entity271 beer and strikes up a conversation			2
she says police once gave her a ticket for " harassing tourists , " official speak for prostitution			0
she says her day job is a physical education teacher for primary school children			0
she earns just $ 10 a month with her state salary and spends that in the bat of one of her false eyelashes			2
but she says the job provides her with a vital cover story			0
having legitimate employment , she says , keeps her out of trouble with the law when she turns tricks at night			0
she charges her foreign clients $ 100 a night , if they do n't bargain her down , she says			0
like many others , she has high hopes that she will be able to cash in on the potential influx of @entity297 tourists , after president @entity299 's announcement of more stable @entity297 - @entity1 relations			1
but back up the street , @entity23 is not convinced there will be a quick fix to those relations			1
the problem , he says , are elderly @entity185 on both sides of the @entity306			0
" for more than half a century , there 's been a lot of hatred between @entity185 in the @entity297 and those on the island			0
there 's been a lot of thirst for revenge			0
we have to wait for the years to pass and the old men to die , " he says			0
" only then can we resolve things in a civilized way			2
