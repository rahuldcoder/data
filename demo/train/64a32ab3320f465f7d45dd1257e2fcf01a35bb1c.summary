@entity0 -- the @entity2 ruled for drug manufacturers tuesday , deciding that a case brought by a @entity6 family who says their child was injured by a vaccine can not be heard outside of a court created to hear such claims			1
the @entity13 family engaged in what they called a " fight for justice , " claiming that a combined disease - prevention booster shot left their then - infant daughter with severe physical injuries			1
but the justices , by a 6 - 2 vote , concluded that drug makers can not be sued outside a special judicial forum set up by @entity26 in 1986 to address specific claims over safety			1
the so - called " vaccine court , " which has handled such disputes , was designed to ensure a reliable , steady supply of vaccines by reducing the threat of expensive lawsuits against pharmaceutical firms			1
it was clear the high court struggled over precisely how the federal statute should be interpreted , and justice @entity39 , writing for the court , said congressional ambiguity in the law played a part in their conclusions			2
" the lack of guidance for design defects [ in the drugs ] combined with the extensive guidance for the grounds of liability specifically mentioned in the act strongly suggests that design defects were not mentioned because they are not a basis for liability , " he wrote			0
at issue was whether such liability claims can proceed in separate state courts , if the vaccine - related injuries could have been " avoided " by better product design and if federal officials had approved another , allegedly safer drug			1
" taxing vaccine manufacturers ' product to fund the compensation program , while leaving their liability for design defects virtually unaltered , would be an odd way to make vaccine manufacture more effective , " said @entity39			1
the lawsuit was brought by the parents of @entity13 , a young woman from the @entity76 area			1
they claimed she was in fine health as an infant in 1992 when given a series of @entity83 shots -- a combination of vaccines to prevent diphtheria , pertussis ( whooping cough ) and tetanus			2
after the third series , according to court briefs , the child began having seizures and became disabled			2
@entity13 , who turns 19 next week , continues to suffer what is described as " residual seizure disorder , " and will require lifelong care			1
the @entity97 alleged @entity98 failed to adequately warn them and other parents of the risks associated with the vaccine			2
court records show the vaccine lot in question produced 65 reports of adverse reactions , including 39 emergency - room visits			1
the family alleges another vaccine owned by @entity110 -- known as @entity111 -- had proven in earlier tests to result in fewer potential side effects			1
the @entity114 claim the company and the federal @entity116 were lax in pushing use of the alternative , potentially safer vaccine			2
the original drug given to @entity13 was discontinued by @entity110 in 1998			1
the " vaccine court " rejected the initial claim , so the family tried to revive the lawsuit in separate state and federal courts			1
their lawyers claimed @entity26 did not intend to block all vaccine - related lawsuits , especially those filed when the harmful side effects were avoidable			2
four firms supply vaccines for the @entity135 market -- @entity110 , @entity136 , @entity137 and @entity138 justice @entity139 dissented in the case , joined by justice @entity141			0
" manufacturers , given the lack of robust competition in the vaccine market , will often have little or no incentive to improve the designs of vaccines that are already generating significant profit margins , " wrote @entity139			2
" nothing in the text , structure , or legislative history remotely suggests that @entity26 intended that result			0
" a federal appeals court eventually ruled for @entity110 , now owned by @entity156 , concluding all design - defect claims were barred under the statute			0
despite that victory , the company urged the high court to hear the case , saying it seeks final resolution on the broader legal questions			2
the @entity166 administration under then - solicitor general @entity167 also urged review and is supporting the company and the federal law in question			0
@entity167 , now a @entity2 justice , sat out of the case to avoid a conflict of interest in the eventual ruling			1
@entity110 and other drug manufacturers say their products are generally safe , but side effects can occur in very rare cases			1
they also say the vaccine industry is generally not profitable , but the health benefits for society in general have kept them in the business			0
for that , they say , legal protection provided by @entity26 is essential to ensure such drugs are widely available and affordable			0
doctors ' groups applauded the high court ruling			0
" @entity199 vaccines are among the greatest medical breakthroughs of the last century , " said dr. @entity195 , president of the @entity196 , which represents 60,000 physicians			0
" today 's @entity2 decision protects children by strengthening our national immunization system and ensuring that vaccines will continue to prevent the spread of infectious diseases in this country			2
" the high court has yet to act on a related pending appeal			0
the @entity211 @entity2 in 2009 became the first appeals court in the @entity135 to allow families to sue outside the special vaccine court			1
that case involved @entity217 - area parents who claimed their son , @entity218 , suffered severe neurological damage 12 years ago from booster shots by @entity110 and @entity136 that contained the mercury - based preservative thimerosal			0
now 14 , the boy is unable to speak , say his parents , @entity224 and @entity225			0
the preservative has since been taken out of nearly all standard vaccines			0
despite winning at the state level , the family has since withdrawn its case , but the liability on drug companies resulting from that decision remains in force in @entity211			1
the @entity236 was passed to establish a nationwide strategy to ensure a secure vaccine supply , promote safety and future research , and compensate innocent victims			0
those goals were listed at the time as a " top public health priority			0
" lawmakers at the time recognized the vaccine supply was suffering under rising company costs from potential liability claims			0
despite @entity116 approval for the vaccines , pharmaceutical firms claimed they were being driven out of the market			0
the special federal court created under the legislation was a liability shield , designed to be a reliable , relatively quick , no - fault solution to various claims			1
unresolved over the years is whether and when certain exceptions to liability should be in play in specific cases			0
the current high court case is @entity13 v. @entity110 ( 09 - 152 )			1
the pending case is @entity110 v. @entity263 ( 08 - 1120 ) .			0

the @entity2 decides in favor of drug manufacturers
the case can not be heard outside of a special court created for such cases , the justices rule
