-- @entity2 , the most successful driver in @entity4 history , is in critical condition after suffering severe head trauma in a skiing accident in the @entity8 on sunday , hospital officials said			1
the 44 - year - old @entity9 , who retired from the elite motorsport for the second time in 2012 , fell and hit his head on a rock , said the director of the @entity17 resort where @entity2 was skiing			1
@entity2 was in a coma when he arrived at the @entity19 of @entity20 and required immediate brain surgery , hospital officials said in a written statement			1
but doctors have n't released details about his injuries or his prognosis			0
resort director @entity28 said the incident happened while @entity2 was skiing off - piste ( on unmarked slopes ) sunday morning in the mountains of @entity17 resort between @entity34 and @entity35			1
@entity28 told @entity0 the racing star was wearing a helmet when he hit his head			1
rescuers reached him minutes later and airlifted him to a nearby hospital , he said			2
it 's unclear what caused the accident , the resort director said			1
" we have to wait for a police report , " he said			0
" there is an open investigation going on			0
we insist on the fact that @entity2 was skiing off - piste and his fall is not linked to an avalanche			1
" @entity2 's spokesperson @entity52 released a statement to the official @entity4 website , confirming the accident had happened on " a private ski trip			1
" " he was taken to hospital and is receiving professional medical care , " she said			2
" we ask for understanding that we can not give continuous information about his health			0
he was wearing a helmet and was not alone			0
for his fall , no other person was involved			0
" a spokesman for the first - aid responders in @entity17 -- who asked not to be named as a matter of protocol -- confirmed that @entity2 was wearing a helmet			1
he said @entity2 had been transferred from the @entity69 to the @entity70 , where there is a trauma center			1
the spokesman added that the injury was " not life - threatening " and that @entity2 was conscious at the scene of the accident			1
former @entity8 @entity4 driver @entity77 visited the hospital in @entity20 but was not able to see @entity2 , @entity76 reported			1

yes i am worried , " @entity77 told @entity76			0

he is a great champion and someone very loved in @entity4			1
" @entity2 made his @entity4 debut in 1991 and had won a record seven world titles by the time of his first retirement in 2006 -- five of those with @entity91			1
he returned to the track with the revived @entity94 team in 2010 , but struggled to repeat his earlier glories			0
his best finish was third place at last year 's @entity98 in @entity99 , his only podium position in three seasons with the @entity9 manufacturer			1
sunday 's accident occurred at a popular ski resort in an area known for its challenging slopes			2
" the great majority of it is above treeline			0
which basically means it 's literally higher than where trees will grow			2
and the result is that if you are anything less than a really experienced skier , it 's very easy to lose your bearings , because you do n't see much in the way of vegetation around you or anything else , " said @entity114 , a former contributing editor at @entity115			2
" it 's just literally all white , all snow			2
" @entity126 journalist @entity125 told @entity0 that @entity2 is " a very good skier " but acknowledged that he is " fearless " -- like most @entity4 drivers			1
" these people do n't recognize fear like you and i do			0
there is no gene in their body that lets them go slow , " @entity125 said			0
" @entity2 was n't a skier when he joined @entity91 ( in 1996 ) but by the end he was excellent			2
each year @entity91 used to have a media week in the @entity8 in @entity139 and they would always have a race -- and it was always @entity2 who won			1
he was a genuinely quick skier			0
" but he was always very mindful of the danger around him			0
i approached him for an interview at the top of the slope and he said it would have to be quick as he wanted to check the piste			2
that meant he wanted to make sure he understood the slopes , the cambers , even though it was only a fun race			0
" @entity0 's @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 contributed to this report .			0
