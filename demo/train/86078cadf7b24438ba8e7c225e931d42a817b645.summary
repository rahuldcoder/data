-- bothered by gadgets like @entity2 that can , theoretically , be used to snoop on you in public ? then why not get your own gadget that can knock them all offline ? that 's what the creators of @entity10 promise			1
billed as a " wireless anti-surveillance system , " @entity13 is , essentially , a portable router that can detect drones , surveillance cameras and mobile tech like @entity2 trying to access your @entity19 signal and boot them off of it			1
" whether business office , restaurant , school or nightclub : it 's your territory and your rules , so make it harder for those that seek to abuse it , " @entity23 's website reads			0
that 's @entity13 's stated purpose , anyway			2
but , as its creators freely note , it also has an " @entity37 " that would let you knock devices off of any wireless network , not just yours			1
the company says it does n't recommend doing that because ... you know ... it 's probably really , really illegal			0
" we take no responsibility for the trouble you get yourself into if you choose to deploy your @entity10 in this mode , " the company says on its site			0
the company notes that the device is not a jammer , which blocks all digital signals in a particular area			0
instead , it targets certain devices the user has identified			2
so , for example , you could tell @entity13 that @entity2 is no bother , but drones and microphones need to be shut down			1
it uses the unique hardware signature that all @entity19 devices have to recognize what it 's seeing before sending a " deauthentication packet " blocking access			1
to be clear , @entity13 ca n't stop anyone from using mobile devices to record or photograph you			2
it only keeps that data from being streamed afterward			0
@entity13 was developed by @entity75 , an engineer and artist from @entity77 living in @entity78 this spring , @entity75 made headlines in the tech press by writing glasshole.sh , a web script that can be used to find and kick @entity2 , specifically , off local computer networks			1
he said positive response to the program led him to pursue making @entity86			0
two versions will be available for $ 50 and $ 100 , available for pre-order starting september 30			0
although @entity2 has no more capabilities to record video or take photos than most smartphones , the wearable gadget from @entity94 , still officially in its testing phase , has been targeted by privacy advocates who say technology has made it too easy to violate privacy rights			2
@entity23 says @entity13 was created " in shared spirit with " stop the @entity23 , a campaign that urges restaurants and other public spaces to ban @entity2 and other surveillance devices			1
@entity94 did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment .			0

@entity13 can remove @entity2 from @entity19 networks
@entity112 , surveillance cameras can also be targeted
creators bill it as *protection* for your private @entity19
but " @entity37 " can knock devices off of all networks
