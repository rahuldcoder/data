-- the meteor that blew up over southwestern @entity5 in february had survived long - ago collisions that blackened its surface , making it harder to spot , a scientist who studied its pieces said wednesday			1
the roughly 60 - foot space rock plunged into @entity11 's atmosphere and exploded over the @entity5 city of @entity13 with the force of about 30 early nuclear bombs			1
of the roughly 100 fragments found so far , the biggest weighs about 11 pounds ( 5 kilograms ) , said @entity18 , a researcher at the @entity19			1

but it was marbled with metallic elements such as iron -- and when the asteroid collided with other bodies floating around the solar system , the heat and force of that impact melted the metal , which seeped into fissures in the surface of the stone and blackened its surface			0
" dark asteroids are harder to detect because they reflect less light , " @entity18 , who presented her findings at an @entity40 conference this week , told @entity0			1
planet of sound : meteor blast resonated around @entity11 while most ordinary rocky asteroids reflect up to 20 % of the sunlight that strikes them , and @entity11 reflects about 40 % , dark asteroids reflect 5 % of the light or less , she said			1
the meteorites collected from the @entity13 incident show varying signs of darkening , with some completely blackened , others made up entirely of light - colored stone and some with a mixture of coloration , @entity18 said			0
" all @entity13 meteorites look different , " she said			0
" you can clearly distinguish three different groups			0
" she said scientists are still working to determine the age of the @entity13 meteor , the largest to hit @entity11 since the 1908 tunguska incident in @entity67			2
@entity68 estimates 4,700 ' potentially hazardous ' asteroids the blast left more than 1,500 injured , mostly by glass from shattered windows , and raised concerns about humanity 's vulnerability to stray asteroids			2
two months later , @entity68 announced a goal of sending a spacecraft out to seize and asteroid and tow it into orbit around the moon , where it could be studied by astronauts -- a project billed in part as a planetary defense mission			0
but it ran into opposition in @entity88 , where a @entity90 committee voted to block any funding for the mission in july .			0

the space rock that blew up over @entity5 had been darkened by *ancient* crashes
" dark asteroids are harder to detect because they reflect less light , " scientist says
the meteor injured about 1,500 *people* when it crashed to @entity11 in february
scientists have found about 100 pieces , the biggest of which is about 11 pounds
