-- the temptation to eat a lot during @entity3 , the @entity5 holy month of fasting , is great , but @entity7 makes a conscious effort to not overdo it			2
it is traditional to eat dates on @entity11 , the breaking of the month - long fast of @entity3			1
" you just kind of have to be mindful of , ok , if i were n't fasting and starving , what kind of meal would i have ? and then kind of limit yourself based on that , " said @entity7 , technology systems director for a hedge fund in @entity18			2
around the world , many observant muslims like @entity7 who 've been fasting all day during @entity3 are thinking about the feast they 'll have on @entity11 , the holiday that ends the holy month , next weekend			2
@entity7 describes this day as the @entity5 equivalent of @entity23 , complete with gift exchanges for children and a lot of food -- everyone can " pig out for the whole day			2
" food experts agree that the fast , during which observant @entity5 refrain from eating during the day , can actually cause people to overeat			1
some people actually take in more calories in one evening meal than they normally would over the course of a normal day during @entity3 , said @entity37 , professor of food science at @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity18			1
" ironically , there are table manner rules in @entity43 , and they actually normally encourage you to leave the table partly hungry , which is consistent with modern health guidelines , " he said			1
this is one of many quirks about religious dietary practices			0
while no specific regimen of the major religions is better or worse than any other , it is important to keep certain health issues in mind when following those rituals , experts say			0
" my general take is that you can have good diets and bad diets in any of the religious systems , " @entity37 said			0
here is a sampling of dietary practices carried out in major religions today , and what you should know about them : fasting religious eating habits are especially relevant this month with @entity5 observing @entity3 and @entity69 about to undertake an approximately 24 - hour fast on @entity70 , which begins at sundown on september 27			1
overeating can harm the body and cause heartburn , cautioned @entity74 , a registered dietitian in private practice in @entity18			1
if you are fasting , you should eat normal sized , well - balanced meals with plenty of liquids to avoid dehydration before a day without eating , she said			1
some people should generally not undertake fasts for health reasons , including pregnant or breastfeeding women and small children , @entity74 said			0
if you have an underlying condition such as diabetes , you should talk to your physician about whether you should fast			1
as a part of a religion , fasting teaches discipline , @entity37 said			0
" the discipline , at least in principle , should help a person eat better , " he said			0
meat laws kosher meat in @entity98 is slaughtered in a specific way by a religious butcher known as a " shochet			1
" the animal is drained of blood and broiled or heavily salted to help remove the blood			0
both @entity98 and @entity43 , whose dietary laws fall under " halal , " mandate that the animal be ritually slaughtered with specific prayers			1
the practice salting of meat helps fight bacteria , but probably not more than other modern antimicrobial techniques , @entity37 said			1
" we 're talking about 4,000 years of salting having benefit , and the rest of the science , in a sense , has caught up in the last 10 years , " he said			1
if sodium is a concern because of high blood pressure , there are butcher shops that sell meat with different kinds of salt , or unsalted meat for broiling			1
the @entity98 custom of separating milk and meat -- not eating the two at the same meal and , for the most strict adherents , having separate plates and utensils for each -- does not appear to have dietary advantages or disadvantages , experts say			1
in a practical sense , this tradition forces people to make their meals more diverse and plan them out more carefully , @entity37 said			2
usually , people will not eat as much meat overall when they practice this kosher separation , he said			1
hold the ham , shellfish @entity98 and @entity43 share a restriction against eating pork			1
some say this helps stave off trichinosis , a parasitic disease that humans can get from eating undercooked or raw pork , @entity37 said			1
however , there is some question about whether pigs in the @entity159 would have had trichinosis ages ago when these traditions were developed , he said			2
in addition , @entity69 traditionally do not eat shellfish , such as shrimp			0
again , there is some association with certain diseases , as well as pollution , but it 's not clear that this tradition leads to better health			0
moreover , one of the staples of @entity98 ritual meals such as @entity175 is gefilte fish , made from carp , which eats shrimp anyway , he said			1
attitudes to alcohol the @entity5 prohibition of alcohol is not necessarily good or bad , @entity74 said			0
there is some research to suggest that alcohol in moderation improves good cholesterol , but it is not definitive , she said			0
red wine is associated with positive effects such as cancer prevention , but grape juice may offer the same benefits , @entity37 said			0
moreover , avoiding alcohol also skirts the negative social implications associated with the substance			2
in @entity98 , however , wine is woven into ceremonies such as those for @entity175 and the sabbath service			1
in fact , some synagogues give small portions of wine to children			0
vegetarianism people who practice religions such as @entity206 are vegetarians to varying degrees , with some members electing to cut out dairy and eggs in addition to animals and fish			2
some @entity214 are also vegetarian , and generally consider cows to be sacred			0
as long as vegetarians get an adequate supply of vitamins and protein , this can be a healthy lifestyle , @entity74 said			0
some do need an extra boost iron or other nutrient , however , and should meet with a dietitian to figure out what 's best for them individually , @entity74 said			0
a matter of taste ? this is just a smattering of traditions practiced by various groups today , and subgroups of the religions mentioned here may have specific additional restrictions on certain animals			0
in the end , many religious dietary practices do not have any more impact on healthy eating than other habits that arise from personal preference , @entity74 said			2
some people avoid shellfish because they simply do not like the taste , and do not get a determinant or benefit as a result			0
but , said @entity37 , kosher and halal are not fundamentally sets of health laws			2
though he follows kosher rules himself , as a teenager in a @entity98 community in @entity253 , @entity254 , he was suspicious of the common wisdom that the milk and meat separation was healthier " because you do n't mix the bacteria			1
" " when i got more formally involved , it was actually sort of nice to realize that in fact these are not health laws			0
they are in the official category of ' @entity267 said , you do , ' and i do n't have to go back and try to chase this down			0

if you are going to fast , have normal sized , well - balanced meals
the practice of salting kosher meat does kill bacteria , but so do other techniques
@entity98 and @entity43 share a restriction against eating pork
some say avoiding pork helps stave off trichinosis , a parasitic disease
