a review of his computer hard drive shows he had planned an attack for years , authorities said			0
according to the criminal complaint against him , @entity11 searched the @entity165 going back to 2012 for information related on placing supply caches , police manhunt techniques and how to evade them and other topics			1

but with @entity11 in custody , the trick - or - treating will go on as normal , said @entity213 chairman @entity212			1
