@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's a tuesday night at @entity4 and @entity7 's suburban @entity6 home , and the family of four is watching " @entity9 , " a scripted @entity11 television program			1
ninety seconds into the comedy , one of the teenage female characters makes mention of @entity17 men and their sexual prowess			1
@entity19 immediately looks over at her 13 - and 11 - year - old boys watching next to her , but she sees no immediate reaction they have gotten the veiled sexually suggestive " joke			2
" " what 's up with that , " says father @entity7 , shaking his head at what he 's just heard			2
" why throw that in this show ? " such are challenges many families face when trying to control the video material their children receive from a range of content providers : tv , radio , @entity37 , mobile devices , and interactive video games			1
now the @entity40 is poised to take a fresh look at a key aspect of multimedia regulation -- " indecent " material aired on the broadcast networks during the supposedly " family friendly " prime - time hours of 8 to 10 p.m. oral arguments in this key free - speech dispute will be held tuesday			1
at issue is whether the @entity53 may constitutionally enforce its policies on " fleeting expletives " and scenes of nudity on prime - time television programs , both live and scripted			2
the agency had imposed hefty fines on broadcasters for separate incidents			2
an expected ruling by summer could establish important @entity65 guidelines over expressive content on the airwaves			2
a range of competing interests are at stake : free speech versus censorship ; regulation versus responsibility ; art versus indecency			1
for the @entity79 , the specific questions raised by this appeal are just the tip of digital iceberg			2
" it 's not ( like ) when we were kids , when there was three networks and @entity86 , " @entity7 told @entity2 one recent evening			2
" we 've had to do the controlling over anything coming over a screen -- a tv screen , computer screen , telephone screen -- anything where there is video content or streaming			1
we lump all that together			2
... " it feels like the @entity99 out there , where there is no rating system			2
we 're not asking for a clampdown on free speech			1
they ( media ) have every right to that			2
we 're just looking for the tools to help us make the best decisions for our kids			2
" the case @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity11 are all parties in the case challenging the @entity53 regulations			2
a federal appeals court in 2010 for a second time struck down the government 's policies , concluding they were vague and inconsistently applied			0
pending fines against the broadcasters were dismissed			0
the government then appealed to the high court			0
controversial words and images have been aired in scripted and unscripted instances on all the major over-the - air networks during the past decade , when the @entity53 began considering a stronger , no - tolerance policy			1
the changes became known as the @entity133 rule , for singer @entity136 's 2003 acceptance speech at the live awards show on @entity115 , where he uttered the phrase " really , really , f --- ing brilliant			1
" the commission specifically cited celebrities @entity140 and @entity142 for potty - mouth language in the 2002 and 2003 @entity144 , which aired live on @entity11			1
@entity149 , in an apparent scripted moment said , " have you ever tried to get cow s -- t out of a @entity148 purse ? it 's not so f --- ing simple			0
" the complaint against @entity113 involved " @entity153 , " a scripted police drama , and the @entity114 complaint involved " @entity156 , " a news and interview program			0
the high court two years ago ruled in favor of the @entity53 on the issue of " fleeting expletives , " concluding federal regulators have the authority to clamp down on broadcast tv networks airing isolated cases of profanity			1
the court , however , refused at the time to decide whether the commission 's policy violated the @entity65 guarantee of free speech , ruling only on its enforcement power			1
the justices ordered the free - speech aspect to be reviewed again by a @entity178 - based federal appeals court , which subsequently ruled in favor of the broadcasters			1
the nine - member bench is now ready to take a broader look at the questions presented			0
in fact , the government helpfully sent to each justice a dvd copy of the " @entity153 " nudity scene			0
there has been no word on whether they have watched it			0
the @entity195 , in its new appeal , lumped both the expletives and nudity cases together , saying the court should decide the free speech questions as one			1
explicit language is heard with greater , albeit varying , frequency on cable television , the @entity37 , and satellite radio , which do not use public airwaves			0
but the federal government is charged with responding to viewer complaints when " indecent " language and images reach broadcast television and radio , which is subject to greater regulation			1
that is especially relevant during daytime and early evening hours , when larger numbers of families and younger viewers may be watching			0
the @entity53 formally reversed its policy in march 2004 to declare even a single use of an expletive could be illegal			0
in response , a voluntary rating system used by all television networks was revised to warn viewers when material that might be offensive will be aired			1
the arguments family rights groups say the tv networks and their cable cousins need to be sent a strong message			1
" you turn on television today , and the amount of bleeps of profane words , almost sounds like a @entity237 signal			0
there hardly are any safe harbors today , on broadcast television , for children and families , " said @entity241 , president of the @entity242 , which helps families make " informed television viewing decisions			1
" " how does more shock , more f - bombs , more indecency serve the public interest , especially when they know children are watching , " he said			1
but the networks and their programming partners worry the @entity53 policies are " chilling " their speech , forcing them to make creative compromises , for fear of sanction			1
" when preparing scripts or song lyrics , they now have to concern themselves with whether something can get airplay , whether their best lines can make it on the screen			0
that inhibits artistic creativity , " said @entity271 , who heads the @entity272 , a law firm representing actors , producers , writers and musicians			0
" the @entity53 's attempt to broaden its scope has created uncertainty , has created circumstances that force broadcasters to censor themselves needlessly and at the expense of the @entity65			0
@entity285 -- the parent company of @entity2 -- filed a supporting amicus brief in the high court dispute two years ago			0
the company is part owner of the @entity291 broadcast network and operates several cable networks			0
the @entity293 for families like the @entity79 , there are no easy answers			0
@entity297 and @entity7 admit they sometimes disagree on what their boys should be watching			0
" he , as a typical guy , may think it 's ok -- some of the potty humor and guy humor -- that i think they do n't need to be exposed to quite yet , " @entity297 said about certain shows			0
@entity7 adds , " we do have blockers in place that prevent the worst cases , but there are ways to get around that , from the kids ' perspective and by the content providers			0
" the couple says parental controls and program ratings are not tools that are comfortably reliable and dependable			0
the @entity79 say they maintain ultimate responsibility , but appreciate the fact the government maintains some regulatory control over broadcasts , supplementing their own monitoring			1
" it 's a business and they ( broadcast networks ) want advertisers and viewers			0
they have these cable stations they 're competing with , so i think they 're are going to push it as far as they can , " @entity297 said			0
" if you expect a show is going to be rated tv - 14 , you want to know there is an institution standing there to make sure the network will provide that kind of show , and if they do n't , then the @entity53 can come in and do what they do			1
" but , she admits , " it 's hard for us sometimes , and you find you 're sort of giving in a little bit with each time you let them ( the children ) watch something a little different			1
" the case is @entity53 v. @entity358 ( 10 - 1293 ) .			1

parents face more challenges when trying to control what children see on tv
the @entity40 is poised to look at " indecent " material aired from 8 to 10 p.m.
