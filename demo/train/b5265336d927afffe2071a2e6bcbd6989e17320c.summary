@entity0 , @entity1 -- if it were n't for the @entity5 , @entity3 might still be working as a sales manager at a car company in the southern @entity9 city of @entity10			1
that is what he was doing when he started writing his first novel on his office 's online bulletin board system back in 2001			1
the @entity5 is increasingly being seen in @entity1 as a tool for literary empowerment , analysts say			1
week by week when he got home from work , @entity19 would post new pieces to a story that painted a bleak yet honest picture of modern urban life in the city where he lived			0
it contained tales about sex , love , gambling and drugs and became so popular that it soon appeared on numerous other online forums			0
today the 35 - year - old is considered one of the most famous authors to have emerged in contemporary @entity1			1
his debut work , " @entity43 : a novel of @entity10 , " has been read by millions of @entity9 " netizens " -- steady internet users -- and adapted for film and television and translated into @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity48			1
he also is viewed as a pioneer of what has become nothing short of a literary renaissance online in the country , particularly among young @entity9 writers			2
this is a constituency that has struggled to find a platform for their work in a publishing industry that is viewed as conservative as it often faces state censorship			2
instead of remaining silent , a new generation of authors has found its voice on the @entity70			0
" it is a very big revolution , " said @entity71 , a political espionage novelist who published his first work online			0
" when you write something on the internet that you ca n't do in reality and you cause a change , that is revolutionary			2
" the past decade has seen the blossoming of countless literary web sites and online forums hosting stories from thousands of aspiring authors			1
their work is read by millions of internet users , leading some to assert that in the future all writing , even reading , in @entity1 will take place in cyberspace			1
" it 's an inevitable trend due to the rapid development of the @entity5 and conceptual change of people , " said @entity91 , head of @entity92 , a division of @entity0 - based @entity93 , the largest online entertainment provider in @entity1			1
" ordinary people have started to realize the world ought to be dominated by them , rather than some media or elite , " @entity91 added			2
" online authors are breaking the rules and using totally fresh concepts			0
" @entity92 operates three of @entity1 's biggest literary portals , including @entity106 , one of the most popular			1
collectively , the web sites receive more than 200 million daily page views and have published nearly 30 billion @entity9 characters , according to @entity112 's company data			1
@entity93 generates revenues through online advertising and by charging readers small amounts to access popular stories or works from famous authors who have been contracted to write			0
however , the company is increasingly trying to earn money by licensing online novels to film studios , music producers , game developers and book publishers while protecting the intellectual property rights of its authors			2
@entity93 owns the rights to more than 200,000 works and has already sold a number of licenses to other entertainment companies , including a popular " @entity139 " novel that is being adapted for film by @entity138 director @entity137			0
" literature is the starting point of all means of entertainment , " @entity91 told @entity2			0
" it can provide numerous blueprints for games , music , movies and dramas			0
a lack of good stories is the main reason of the underdevelopment of entertainment [ in @entity1 ]			1
" many of @entity1 's usually young and often female cyber-writers are posting their work online with the hope that , like @entity161 's novels , their stories will be read by millions , ultimately becoming books or movies and turning the authors into celebrities			1
the online @entity9 literary scene is , in some ways , like a tv reality show			2
bookstores now have sections devoted to @entity5 novels published as paperbacks , while a number of other influential writers have emerged from the web over the years , including @entity176 , whose books about love and loneliness in @entity9 cities have sold more than a million copies			1
" in @entity183 , people have the @entity183 dream			0
in @entity1 , people have the online dream , " said @entity185 , a college junior who says almost all of her friends read online fantasy novels about time travel , romance or some mixture of the two			1
these genres are mostly read by ordinary girls who find life boring , said @entity185 , noting her roommate especially fancies a novel from the @entity106 web site called " @entity201			2
" " i prefer real literature rather than imaginary works , " added the 20 - year - old			0
she then described a cyber-novel she is planning to write about a princess who lives during the @entity207			0
after leaving her home in @entity210 , the princess returns to find she no longer recognizes her family or the society she had lived in a few years before			0
" i just want to convey my opinions about today 's life , " @entity185 said			2
" sometimes euphemism is more powerful			0
" today it is more accepted for @entity9 publishers to take risks with voices emerging online , many now printing stories that simply would not have been possible a decade ago			0
publishing houses often peruse web sites for talent whose writing can be brought to readers who are not logged on			1
" publishers can come in and say there are readers for this , and this is the demographic and if we want to hit young adults , then this is a great voice , " said @entity227 , the manager of @entity1			1
" [ the literary web sites ] are now a very natural part of the publishing scene in @entity1			1
it is really a convergence of print and online writing			2
" yet despite what has been a gradual commercialization and subsequent opening up of the @entity9 publishing industry during the past few years , many of the writers who are able to self - publish with freedom online find they still can face substantial censorship when their works are adapted for offline audiences			0
" offline publishing is still tightly controlled and not easy to change , " said @entity71 , whose spy novels are banned in the country			0
" any internet novel is largely edited when it goes to publishing			1
" in the long run , however , @entity71 said he believes the freedom of literary expression on the @entity5 will spur even further liberalization in the @entity9 publishing industry			2
" it is a good thing and it is a promising thing , " said @entity71			0
" nowadays for more and more people if they want to express themselves , they can go online			0

@entity1 now has the most internet users in the world
publishing houses increasingly *patrol* web sites for writing talent , *observer* says
one of @entity1 's biggest literary portals reports 200 million page views a day
