-- while the @entity7 militia leads the battle for control of @entity11 's airport , another set of militia and radicalized @entity4 insurgents in the east are threatening a fragile @entity12			1
the increasingly unstable political and social climate in the country is indicative of a weak and ineffective government that is failing to answer internal security concerns as well as the basic aspirations of its citizens			1
for these reasons primarily do the @entity7 militia and renegade general @entity21 feel they have a mark to make in the security and political vacuum left by a corrupt and inept national government			1
while politicians in the highest echelons continue to siphon the country 's oil wealth , the armed militias in response are taking over oil terminals in the east , including @entity35			2
@entity21 , a @entity12 exile since 1987 , returned to his home city of @entity38 from the @entity39 , and was frequently seen in the city 's old courthouse , the headquarters of the revolution in the east			1
along with the former @entity46 chairman @entity45 , @entity21 directed and advised in the crucial months of the revolution			2
as a retired general , many @entity12 are unsure of the longer - term motives and personal ambitions of a man who once attempted to overthrow @entity52			1
it is no small irony that @entity59 , like the rebel militias that are still fighting for control of strategic bases in the country , is directly contributing to the instability of the country and undermining what little authority the government possesses			1
from @entity66 to @entity67 , and down to the border with @entity69 , there is no effective government influence			0
while elders in @entity38 want to negotiate with the @entity4 fundamentalists , @entity59 will not			2
his imposed policy is for these insurgents to surrender or be killed			0
recently , a car bomb was detonated outside @entity21 's house , killing and injuring many			1
like the brutal murder of @entity80 on june 25 , 2014 , it is a further sign of the dangerous pitch of instability that the country has reached			0
ordinary @entity12 are now owning and bringing guns into their homes			2
friends in @entity12 tell me the feeling of insecurity has permeated every household and shows no signs of abating			2
meanwhile , the government is continuing to fail to live up to its promises and has not provided security or jobs to ordinary citizens			2
at the same time , the quest for a secular society also continues , albeit whilst people purchase guns for their households and politicians steal the country 's revenues			0
the @entity39 , @entity105 and @entity106 can not afford @entity12 to become a failed state like @entity108			0
the division of @entity12 into east and west is not a viable option and is not in the long - term interests of @entity12 or wider regional security			0
this debate does however highlight the old argument that the majority of the country 's oil revenues still continue to go to @entity11 and surrounding areas			0
@entity12 can be pulled back from the brink , but , the @entity120 must not leave @entity12 to its own ( current ) inept devices			0
the government and the military need continued specialist training , advice and resources to fight the @entity4 insurgents and the disparate rebel militias across the country , and to face the new security threats coming from the south and the @entity133			1
this process has already begun , with the @entity39 ' capture of the leader of the attack on the @entity138 in @entity38 in september 2012 , which killed ambassador @entity139			0
the international community also needs to put pressure on the @entity12 government to weed out endemic corruption			1
the @entity12 leadership need to maintain democratic credibility , unlike the last prime ministerial run that necessitated the intervention of the @entity148 to rule the appointment of @entity150 as prime minister as illegal , to order that a new election be held , this time with a full @entity153 in session			0
the struggle to tackle armed groups in @entity12 continues , and it simply can not be left to one renegade general to remove @entity159 insurgents and keep armed militia groups in check			1
the views expressed in this commentary are soley those of @entity164 .			0

@entity12 's instability is indicative of an ineffective government , says @entity168
general @entity21 and the @entity7 militia are *stepping* into the power vacuum , she says
but @entity168 says @entity59 and rebel militias are directly contributing to @entity12 's instability
she says the international community can not let @entity12 fail and must help its government
