-- if you 're handing over cash for a heavily discounted @entity3 from some random guy in a @entity6 's parking lot or at a gas station , then yes , you should consider your purchase a risk			1
but when you 're like @entity10 and you buy @entity12 's popular tablet from a well - known retailer , you expect it to be legit			0
@entity10 says she walked out of a @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , last month with what she believed was a new $ 499 @entity3			1
when she got home and opened the box , she told @entity0 affiliate @entity21 , she thought , " ' wow , it 's a little on the light side -- @entity12 's an elegant product			2
' " then she tried to turn it on			0
when nothing happened , @entity10 looked at the plastic rectangle more closely			0
the imitation ipad -- an @entity31 , if you will -- tried to replicate a real @entity3 's charging port and speakers , the latter of which were small , painted - on dots			1
" when i realized it , i was upset , " she told @entity21			0
" i just paid $ 500 for a paperweight			0
" if her story sounds familiar , it 's because it has happened at retailers in a variety of states over the past few years			2
numerous shoppers have purchased what they thought were @entity3 , only to open the box and find a worthless decoy inside			1
to make matters worse , some stores have refused to give refunds on the grounds that the buyers might have been trying to scam them			0
the majority of news reports on the problem have involved @entity3 purchases at @entity15 , although other retailers are not immune			1
in december 2010 , the year the first @entity3 hit shelves , a man in @entity59 , @entity17 , said he spent $ 800 at a local @entity60 on an @entity3 that turned out to be fake			1
the store said the same thing had happened to five or six other people , he told his local @entity65 station , @entity64			0
the next year , @entity66 told a similar story after the businessman purchased what he thought was an @entity3 from a @entity15 in @entity70 , @entity71			1
like @entity10 , @entity66 's @entity3 was packaged in a way that suggested he was buying a product straight from the manufacturer			2
" i think that probably somebody switched ( the @entity3 ) and took it back with the cellophane and everything , " @entity66 told @entity0 in a recent interview			2
" an employee says , ' oh it 's wrapped up , we 'll stick it back in inventory , ' and it gets sold to somebody else			0
i think that 's what happens			0
" that same year in @entity88 , @entity89 , several @entity3 shoppers at @entity91 and @entity60 stores said they opened the @entity12 packaging to find plastic bags filled with modeling clay			2
last november , a man in @entity97 accidentally gave his wife a fake @entity3 for her birthday , thinking he 'd spent $ 480 on the real deal			1
in january , a woman in @entity102 , @entity103 , said that she , too , wound up with a fake @entity12 tablet after shopping at her neighborhood @entity15			1
" when i got home and opened the box , i thought it was a real @entity3 , " @entity106 told the @entity107			1
" i took out the charger and then tried to plug it in the @entity3 , and that is when i started to notice everything			2
" so how is this fraud happening ? retail chains are n't saying			0
but the prevailing theory begins with a scam artist buying an @entity3 , replacing it with something of similar size and weight and then repackaging the box so it looks ready for the sales floor once again			1
then the person returns the box for a refund			0
other speculation has focused on unscrupulous store employees raiding storerooms to make similar swaps			2
@entity15 at first declined to offer @entity10 , the @entity17 woman , an exchange or refund because of a policy against returned merchandise that has been unwrapped			1
but after the local @entity134 station got involved , @entity10 eventually received a refund for her purchase			0
@entity15 spokesperson @entity137 said the company is aware of the problem and is working to address it			1
" we 're actively reviewing our transactional records , and then going back and looking at the video that matches up with that to determine how this product is getting back on our shelves , " she said			0
" if it appears that it is fraudulent , we will share all that information with local law enforcement			0
" @entity60 , which has seen similar fake - ipad episodes , did not respond to repeated requests for comment			2
@entity15 's @entity137 recommends that @entity3 shoppers open the box and check the tablet carefully before making a purchase			1
@entity66 's experience made him wary of purchasing items from anyone other than the manufacturer			0
but he did learn a valuable lesson : double - check the serial number on the box			1
" if you have an issue , do n't rely on the retailer to just check the item that 's inside the box ; call @entity12 and verify the serial number that 's on the box itself , " he said			1
" either require them to do it while there , or when you get home ... ( that will tell you ) if it had been sold prior to your date of purchase			0

a @entity17 woman says an @entity3 she bought from @entity15 was fake
a rash of similar cases have been reported in the past six months
@entity15 is aware of the problem and is working to address it
*advice* : open the box in the store and check the serial number on the box as well
