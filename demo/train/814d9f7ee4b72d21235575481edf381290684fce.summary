-- the rev. @entity1 , a leading evangelical minister , claimed last friday that @entity2 are not @entity3			1
@entity1 went on to declare that @entity4 is " a cult , " meaning it 's not a " real " religion , and he implored his followers to reject @entity8 , a @entity2 , as a candidate for president because as @entity1 sees it : " as @entity3 , we have the duty to prefer and select @entity3 as our leaders			1
" @entity1 is infamous for his past " @entity3 " comments such as : jews , gays , @entity17 and @entity2 are all going to hell ; @entity19 encourages pedophilia ; and that gays should be banned from the military because 70 % of the gay population has @entity23			1
at the time of @entity1 ' comments about @entity2 , i happened to be in @entity27 , the state with the largest percentage of @entity2 in the nation			1
i 'm not @entity2 , meaning i 'm not a member of the @entity31			2
and prior to this trip , i had met only a few members of the @entity31			2
i was in @entity34 because i 'm performing as part of a stand - up comedy tour called " the @entity17 are coming , " featuring @entity38 - @entity17 comedians performing free comedy shows across the country as a way , we hope , to counter misinformation and build bridges with our fellow @entity38			1
there we were -- muslims and @entity2 -- bonding on some level because we were both the subject of attacks from people on the far right			2
earlier in this presidential campaign it was our time , with @entity54 essentially arguing for discrimination against @entity38 muslims simply because of our faith			2
now the voices of hate had turned their focus to @entity2			0
over the last four days i have spent a great deal of time with members of the @entity31			0
i 'm not saying that i 'm an expert on their teachings and , to be honest , i had some apprehension about @entity2 because the @entity31 had publicly funded opposition to marriage equality in @entity69 , which i disagree with because i oppose discrimination against any @entity38			0
but i can now say without hesitation that the @entity31 members we met represented the best of @entity75			1
they were truly caring and compassionate people			1
and perhaps it 's overly simplistic to define an entire religion by the few hundred we met , but let 's be honest : many define religions , races and ethnicities by a few of their worst examples			0
i prefer instead to define minority groups by their best examples			0
while it probably does n't matter to a person like @entity1 , the @entity31 members we met proudly consider themselves @entity3			1
after all , the full name of their religion is " the @entity31			0
" if your religion has the words " @entity103 " in its name , it 's kind of a tip off that @entity103 's teachings are important to you			0
in contrast to the hate spewed by @entity1 , we found that the @entity2 we met truly represent the @entity3 ideal of loving your neighbor			1
one of the best examples we found of a true @entity3 was @entity113 , a proud member of the @entity31 and a talented glassmaker who created an awe - inspiring glass exhibit called " @entity116 : a @entity117 of @entity118 from the @entity119			2
" @entity113 had sacrificed hundreds of hours of time from his family and friends and spent more than $ 7,000 of his own money to create this exhibit			0
why did @entity113 do this ? because he believed that fostering understanding and countering negative misconceptions about another faith -- in this case @entity19 -- was part of his duty as a @entity3			0
this passage from the @entity133 is often cited as one that articulates @entity103 ' philosophy : " a new command i give you : love one another			0
as i have loved you , so you must love one another			0
by this all men will know that you are my disciples , if you love one another			0
" ( @entity145 13:34 - 35 ) in comparing the hate - filled language of @entity1 with the words and good deeds of the @entity2 we met , it is clear to me who is best following the teachings of @entity103 and truly deserves to be called a @entity3			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			1

rev. @entity1 recently called @entity4 " a cult "
@entity1 has a long *history* of hateful *proclamations* , @entity156 says
many *mormons* are caring , compassionate people , @entity156 says
@entity156 : is n't compassion what @entity75 is supposed to be about ?
