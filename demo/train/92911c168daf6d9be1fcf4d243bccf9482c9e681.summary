-- as a concept , recycling has lived and died many times throughout its 4,000 - year old history			1
but it always re-emerges as an idea when humans need it most , such as during the @entity9 , and later during @entity10 , when @entity12 companies recycled or reused around 25 percent of the waste stream			1
a sign in @entity15 , @entity16 signalling a recycling drop - off area			2
today , the global recycling industry generates $ 160 billion a year , processing more than 500 million tons of materials			1
the industry is becoming one of the world 's biggest employers			1
while the official amount of people employed by the industry is 1.5 million worldwide , the real figure -- when you factor in illegal recycling operations in the developing world -- is likely to be much , much higher			1
the @entity31 believes , for example , that as many as 10 million people in @entity34 alone are now in the recycling business			1
what 's not to like about recycling ? there are some fairly persuasive arguments for recycling , and for using recycled goods			1
energy savings is just one of them			0
by reusing existing materials you are essentially removing the process involved in sourcing the " virgin materials " in the first place			0
take soda cans , made from aluminum			0
according to @entity52 , creating a ton of these from scratch takes five times the amount of energy as it would to produce a ton of recycled cans			2
according to the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) , the companies that manufacture recycled aluminum are using 95 percent less energy than if they were using " virgin materials			2
" ( for plastics the energy savings are almost as high -- 80 percent , @entity61 says , while making paper from recycled paper ( as opposed to wood ) can save 64 percent of energy			2
) looking at it another way , according to the @entity70 , the amount of energy saved in one year by @entity12 recycling their soda cans , plastic containers , newspapers and packaging represented the energy equivalent of : not surprisingly , recycling also impacts pollution levels			1
@entity61 says producing paper from recycled paper as opposed to wood can slash air pollution by as much as 74 percent and water pollution by 35 percent ; while manufacturing recycled steel results in 86 percent less air pollution			2
there are different types of pollution savings to be made , reducing the pollution generated by manufacturing the stuff in the first place			0
and then there is the pollution that results in dumping the waste in landfills , instead of recycling it			2
a recent report from the @entity100 ( @entity100 ) , for example , has predicted that greenhouse gas emissions from household waste will drop by more than 80 percent by 2020 -- largely because of increases in recycling levels which are diverting waste away from landfills			2
and the carbon savings can be huge , even when a relatively small amount of effort has been made			0
the @entity110 has one of @entity113 's lowest recycling rates when it comes to municipal waste -- 27 percent			2
yet , the impact on its carbon emissions has already become worthwhile , according to @entity118 , or @entity118			0
@entity118 says that these relatively minor efforts already mean a 10 million - to 15 million - ton reduction in carbon dioxide ( @entity121 ) emissions a year -- the equivalent of taking 3.5 million cars off the road			1
what about the costs ? one of the main objections to the recycling movement has been the cost factor			1
throwing something away is obviously going to be a lot cheaper than going through the hassle of recycling it			2
and certain materials are going to be a lot tougher to recycle than others , driving up costs and energy spent			0
but , as a 2004 study by research group @entity142 found out , there are many different ways to measure cost			0
@entity142 looked at the @entity146 province of @entity147 , which back in the 1990s had decided that 50 percent of its trash was going to get recycled instead of landing up in incinerators or landfills			0
the annual cost to the province of doing this was $ 18 million more than it would have cost to chuck trash away			0
but , when different factors were considered , the number looked very different these factors included : @entity142 concluded that @entity147 was in fact saving up to $ 125 million simply because it had embraced recycling			1
the developing world 's gain ? arguably , recycling has seen the most economic success in the poorer parts of the world			1
according to the @entity171 , the aluminum can recycling business in @entity169 now employs more people than its car industry			1
@entity169 collecting used soda cans have boosted their earning power significantly , earning $ 200 a month against the standard minimum $ 81 monthly salary			0
then there are the inhabitants of a single 174 - hectare slum in @entity181 's largest city , @entity182 , that have managed to create a $ 1.3 billion recycling industry between them , according to the @entity185			1
@entity186 is home to one million slum dwellers , with a quarter of them fully employed ( albeit often illegally ) in a recycling business which processes 80 percent of @entity182 's plastic waste alone			1
" there is a lot to be learned from the developing world , " the @entity185 quoted @entity52 's @entity192 as saying			1
" where a scavenger mentality , grassroots recycling and sheer necessity can lead to imaginative leaps in redeploying waste			0
" that being said , the economic impact may be welcomed by those in poorer countries sifting through everyone 's trash -- but the health impact still leaves a lot to be desired			0
around 70 percent of the world 's electronic waste ends up in southern @entity34			1
a recent study by @entity213 's @entity212 found that the basic methods employed to recycle these items was having an unsettling effect on people living nearby , specifically women			0
women in their mid- 20s in one recycling site in @entity221 were found to be carrying the highest levels of cancer - causing toxic chemicals like dioxins and furans than they had seen anywhere else in the world			1
it is still too early to say what the long - term effects of these chemicals will be on these women , but it is likely that it will become clear when they attempt to have children			0
dioxins and furans have been linked to reproductive problems specifically			0
the researchers found that the women had twice the amount of dioxins in their breast milk and three times as much in their placentas as normal			0
they were also found to be at increasing risk of experiencing spontaneous abortions the longer they chose to live there			0
