-- i learned a new word today : @entity3			0
i came across it buried in this year 's @entity6 theme			1
apparently it means multiple structures , overlapping , interacting , connecting and networking			0
good grief , am i really climbing a @entity13 mountain to learn about an arcane corner of the @entity16 dictionary ? the theme is set each year by the @entity18			1
it is invariably a wordy bit of pretentious nonsense , designed to sum up what they hope we will focus upon in our meetings in the @entity26			0
this year its headline is " the @entity29 : @entity30			2
" often the theme is overtaken by crises , pressing issues and economic fires , and everyone long forgets all about it before the first marshmallows have melted into the first hot chocolates			1
but suddenly i realized i was tapping this out on an @entity40 , with a @entity42 keyboard , while flying at 30,000 feet , and using the airliner 's @entity43 to read a blog post by an influential 19 - year - old from some eastern emerging market			2
hang on , i thought , this year 's theme may have a little more staying power			1
in a further break from tradition , it may also actually make sense ( assuming one can boil it down to useable @entity16 ! )			0
what this theme recognizes is that during five years of crises massive changes have taken place simultaneously : the ubiquitous @entity61 has forged its way into previously closed societies ; social media has exploded ; there has been a revolution in communication ; new , powerful economies have emerged ; and there has been a fundamental shift in economic power towards the east			1
in an incredibly short space of time , all the accepted truths that have guided us pretty much since the end of @entity76 have gone up in smoke			1
as well as trumpeting that the immediate crisis is over , this year 's @entity6 will posit that we now need to think about what 's next -- and how we will manage it			1
wefers are being asked to debate how society should make decisions in the future in this new world			0
i think the @entity18 has a point			0
this is not just about smartphones , blogging and @entity93			0
it 's about different ways of doing almost everything			2
the economic , social and cultural wreckage from the crises of the past five years is everywhere ; in its wake is a landscape where old rules no longer exist and the new ones have yet to be written and agreed			1
economically , central bankers own the world			0
societally , a " lost generation " threatens cohesion			0
culturally , the issue of privacy has leaped to the top of the agenda -- from @entity112 - style data snooping by governments , to private companies like @entity93 , @entity115 ( including its intriguing purchase of @entity117 ) and @entity118 thinking it is ok to treat my information as their own -- and to sell it on			0
@entity6 works best in two very clear situations : when there is a full - scale raging fire , and the big economic players come together and thrash it out ( the @entity128 , the @entity129 , and the eurozone crises spring to mind ) ; or when serious tectonic shifts are going on in economies and societies			1
often the @entity18 's grandiosity forces the issue beyond breaking point			2
but i do n't think this will happen this time round			0
the issues are prescient , they are on everyone 's mind , we all know that ' times are different ' and we are by no means sure how to handle them			2
the question is whether the people coming to @entity6 can set their own little agendas aside for a few days , sit down , and really think about the kind of world we are facing now that the long overdue recovery is taking hold			1
they must then question the role of government , social media , traditional media , and business in all of this			1
if they can do this then our trip up the @entity13 mountain will have been worth it			0
of course this will require @entity166 , government ministers and the grandees of @entity6 to actually practice what they preach and truly behave heterarchically			1
perhaps @entity18 should provide a dictionary for all delegates in case anyone is in any doubt			0
