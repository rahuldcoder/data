-- the @entity3 middle school shooting allegedly by a 12 - year - old boy highlights how such gunfire is now occurring in @entity7 's earlier grades , raising disturbing issues on whether such youngsters know the devastating consequences of such violence and on how they should then be adjudicated , experts say			1
" it 's becoming more and more common , especially in the middle - school age , for these kids to be committing these violent acts , " said @entity12 , clinical psychologist at the @entity13			1
@entity18 was referring to a list of school violence compiled by @entity0 tracing violence in @entity7 schools , including shootings in middle and elementary schools			1
that tally includes last october 's shooting in @entity27 , @entity28 , by a 12 - year - old boy who killed himself after fatally shooting a teacher ; a 2010 shooting in a @entity31 , @entity32 , by a ninth - grader who fatally shot a boy , 14 , in the head ; a 2000 shooting in @entity37 , @entity38 , in which a 6 - year - old boy killed another 6 - year - old ; and the 1999 shooting in @entity42 , @entity3 , in which a 12 - year - old boy killed a classmate , 13			1
horrific as it is , the aftermath of such violence is complicated by the immaturity of the shooter			0
" middle - schoolers are impulsive and they ca n't think of the consequences of their actions , and they ca n't think of empathy , " @entity18 said			1
" some of them have difficulty with empathy or taking on the perspective of another person			0
" not even the word " gunman " applies because the alleged assailant is still a boy			0
" people should remember that a 12 - year - old is barely past the age of believing in @entity68 , " said @entity62 , a behavior expert and psychologist			1
" while there is great variance in cognitive development , plenty of kids this age are unable to fully comprehend that death is permanent , " @entity62 said			2
" add to that the impact of violent video games where ' downed ' characters get up again , and there is good reason to assume this child does not think like an adult			0
" but it will be society 's adults who must decide on how to charge a preteen suspect			2
in this week 's shooting in @entity89 , @entity3 , a 12 - year - old boy is accused of walking into his school 's gym and opening fire with a 20 - gauge shotgun upon schoolmates who were gathered indoors to stay out of the cold before classes began			1
two students at @entity99 , ages 11 and 13 , were wounded and are hospitalized			0
the 12 - year - old boy accused in the shooting , which lasted about 10 seconds , is in custody , and authorities had n't yet filed charges as of wednesday			1
his name is n't being released by authorities			2
" it 's a very complex case , and we need to make sure we get it right , " @entity3 state police chief @entity106 said of his investigators ' work with prosecutors in preparing juvenile court charges			2
" we believe the suspect modified the weapon by cutting off its stock , " which gave the shotgun a pistol grip , @entity106 added			0
the boy may have warned some students not to go to school before the attack , police said			0
@entity3 law requires anyone under age 15 to be charged in juvenile court , no matter how violent the crime is , said @entity0 legal analyst @entity129			1
nationwide , " for a long period of time , if you were under 16 , it did n't matter what crime , you would end up in juvenile court , " @entity129 said			1
" but states began providing exceptions for ( juvenile ) violent crimes to go to adult court , but none of those go below the age of 13			1
it varies from state to state			0
" still , the 12 - year - old suspect could face a serious charge in @entity3 juvenile court			1
for example , @entity129 cited how a 10 - year - old boy in @entity149 , @entity3 , was accused of fatally shooting his father in 2009 after being grounded and told not to play with the x-box or computer			1
but last year , when the boy turned age 14 , he was charged with first - degree murder -- in juvenile court			1
" you can be tried in juvenile court of the same offense ( as in a criminal court ) -- first degree murder -- but the penalty is different			0
for a juvenile , he 's looking at a maximum incarceration until age 21			2
it 's safe to say you would remain incarcerated in a juvenile facility for the majority of your sentence , " @entity129 said			0
the goal of the juvenile court system is rehabilitation , whereas the court system for adults seeks punishment , deterrence , and societal protection from offenders as well as rehabilitation , experts say			2
" our laws exist to protect minors because it has been understood that adolescents and children do not fully understand the consequences of their actions , and that rehabilitation is more likely with a developing brain , " @entity62 said			0
between ages 12 and 17 -- roughly the middle and high school years -- youngsters begin to develop an ability to comprehend multiple perspectives , @entity18 said			1
" it can happen earlier for some kids and it can start later for other kids , " @entity18 said			0
" the ability to understand consequences can happen later , but we do n't what 's happening for this particular kid " in the @entity89 case , she said			2
" clearly , he was n't one of those kids who was able to do that , " she added , referring to the 12 - year - old boy 's ability to understand the implications of his actions			1
@entity18 is concerned about how troubled youths may respond to their issues , especially when they read or hear about school shootings			1
" part of it is , too , they hear what else is happening in the country , " @entity18 said of the growing frequency of school shootings			2
" it may be a depressed or isolated child and they may have trouble with impulse control , and they see another kid in the country doing it , and they think , ' maybe i can do that , too , as an option			0
' " as trauma psychologist , @entity18 advocates a recommendation by the @entity235 that pediatricians provide firearm safety counseling to patients and their parents			0
but that @entity241 recommendation has been controversial and been challenged in several states , including @entity243 , where gun rights advocates have sought gag laws against such physician counseling			0
the @entity241 also advocates gun control			0
" i think pediatricians should ask about guns in the home , " @entity18 said			0
" i do n't think that endangers anyone 's privacy			0

" a 12 - year - old is barely past the age of believing in @entity68 , " another expert says
