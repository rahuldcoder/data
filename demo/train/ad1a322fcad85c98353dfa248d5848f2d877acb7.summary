they also want existing photos taken offline , the palace spokesman told @entity2			0
the @entity15 magazine closer ran photos last week of @entity5 sunbathing topless in private			1
@entity33 , an @entity35 gossip magazine owned by the same company , has said it will put out a special edition on monday with photos of @entity4 and @entity5 on vacation			1
@entity40 upset about topless photos the royal couple is not pursuing legal action in other countries currently , the palace spokesman said , although the photos have also been published in @entity46			1
the palace expressed outrage last week that the @entity15 magazine published the pictures , comparing the invasion of privacy to those suffered by @entity4 's late mother , @entity54 , princess of @entity55			1
@entity4 and @entity5 were said to be " hugely saddened " by what palace officials called a " grotesque " invasion of privacy while they were on a private vacation			1
but the @entity61 went on to print the pictures on saturday			2
@entity64 officials slammed the newspaper 's decision as driven only by greed			0
but editor @entity68 told the @entity69 that outrage over the images was only felt in @entity12 and that readers in the @entity73 wanted to know what all the " kerfuffle " was about			0
he was " a little taken aback by the reaction in the @entity12 , " he said , saying the newspaper was treating @entity5 no differently from any other celebrity			1
" she 's not the future queen of @entity46 so really the only place this is causing fury seems to be in the @entity12 , " he said , suggesting that the @entity12 press were behaving with some hypocrisy			2
@entity68 said the @entity61 was reproducing the images as published in @entity87 on friday rather than buying them directly			1
the pictures are not being published in the @entity46 edition			1
@entity46 is part of the @entity12			2
@entity93 welcome awaits @entity4 and @entity40 the latest controversy comes only three weeks after the @entity12 royal family was caught up in a media furor over images of @entity4 's younger brother , prince @entity98 , partying naked in his @entity100 hotel room with a group of girls			1
in a sign of how divisive the issue of royal privacy has become , a co-owner of the @entity61 , media group @entity103 , said it in no way backed the newspaper 's decision to run the pictures of @entity5			1
in a statement , the company -- which runs the @entity61 in a joint venture with @entity115 , but does not exert editorial control over it -- said it was " profoundly dismayed " by the move			2
" we abhor the decision of the @entity61 to publish these intrusive pictures of the @entity122 and @entity40 , which we , like @entity64 , believe to be a grotesque invasion of their privacy , " @entity103 's communications director @entity119 said			2
@entity103 also owns the @entity126 and the @entity61 , among other @entity12 publications , which have not run the pictures of @entity5 , nor of @entity98			1
@entity4 , who is second in line to the throne , and his wife are on an official tour of southeast @entity133 nations			2
they were due in the @entity1 sunday on the next leg of a tour that has been overshadowed by the furor over the photographs			0
@entity5 was " upset " with closer magazine , a palace source told @entity2			0
@entity141 told @entity2 it plans to run 26 pages of photographs of @entity4 and @entity40 on vacation in an " extraordinary " special edition to go on sale in @entity35 on monday			2
@entity33 's front cover will also feature three revealing pictures of @entity5 , according to a copy of the page and statement sent by @entity141 spokeswoman @entity152 via e-mail			0
" it is a story worth publishing in an extraordinary edition because it shows in a natural light the everyday life of a very famous contemporary young couple in love , " @entity33 's editor - in - chief , @entity154 , is quoted as saying in the statement			0
" the fact that they happen to be the future king and queen of @entity167 certainly makes it more interesting and current , and in line with today 's concept of monarchy			0
" a @entity64 spokeswoman said : " any such publication would serve no purpose other than to cause further , entirely unjustifiable upset to the @entity122 and @entity40 , who were enjoying time alone together in the privacy of a relative 's home			0
" opinion : @entity12 privacy should start with @entity12 press according to @entity141 's website , @entity87 has an average weekly circulation of about 414,000 , while @entity33 sells more than 340,000 copies a week			0
@entity186 , daughter of former @entity35 prime minister @entity187 , has been chairwoman of the media group since 2003			0
legal analysts suggest the company hopes to recoup any legal costs and fines it may incur by increasing sales , thanks to the revealing pictures			0
the grainy pictures published by @entity87 in @entity15 appear to have been taken with a long camera lens while the couple was staying at a private chateau belonging to @entity4 's uncle in @entity201 , in southern @entity15			1
the new privacy controversies have dredged up the royal family 's often rocky relationship with the press and put a spotlight on how the palace deals with the media after the tragic death of @entity54 , as she fled photographers in @entity25 15 years ago			1
@entity211 , editor - in - chief of @entity87 in @entity15 , defended the decision to publish the images in an interview with @entity2 affiliate @entity215 , saying : " we were just doing our job			2
" @entity211 said that there had been no debate at the magazine over whether to publish the photos , and that they show the royals " are just like any other couple in love			0
" @entity12 tabloid prints naked prince @entity98 pictures on saturday the management of @entity87 said the photos " are in no case degrading			0
" @entity15 law provides for " draconian sanctions " to protect against this kind of behavior , @entity231 lawyer @entity230 said , including orders to take magazines off shelves and the imposition of serious fines			0
but even if distribution of the images is contained to a degree , @entity241 said , the damage is done to the extent that very private information about the duchess has now become public knowledge			0
no @entity12 newspaper has so far published the photographs of @entity5			2
the @entity12 media is currently under close scrutiny after revelations of phone hacking and other abuses			0
the conclusions of an independent judge - led inquiry , which may recommend greater restrictions on media freedoms , are expected by the end of the year			0
