-- january 18 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 , @entity5 @entity6 @entity7 , @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity15 , @entity16 : i 'm @entity18 and this is @entity0 ! we 're back from the long weekend and ready to kick off 10 minutes of commercial - free headlines			2
we start in the @entity23 state of @entity5			1
first up : @entity24 @entity25 : @entity23 representative @entity26 could be released from a hospital there in just days or weeks			1
congresswoman @entity26 was one of the victims of the shooting attack in @entity4 , @entity5 earlier this month			2
on sunday , doctors upgraded her condition from critical to serious , so that 's a step in the right direction			1
hundreds of people took to the streets on sunday to participate in a " @entity35			2
" organizers said they wanted to honor the victims of the shooting and find a way to help bring the community together			2
some congressional leaders from both parties are trying to come together in their own way , starting with something small : sitting together at the @entity46 address			1
this is the speech that the president gives to @entity50 every year			2
and what you see in these pictures is last year 's @entity46 address			1
you notice that one section is standing , while another is sitting ? that 's because @entity58 and @entity59 usually do n't sit together during these speeches			1
this year , though , you might see a different seating arrangement			1
@entity62 @entity25 : this weekend , here in @entity66 , a cast of thousands got together for the @entity62			2
the event celebrates the performing arts			2
it takes place the same weekend as @entity71			2
in recognition of his dream , students at the festival had the chance to talk about their dreams			1
listen to what they had to say			0
@entity81 , student : i have a dream that some day kids will have a bigger voice in their communities			0
i feel like kids have a lot to say , but it 's often not heard by the adults around them			1
@entity92 , student : my dream is to become an endangered species specialist and help save a kind that 's dying off slowly			1
@entity97 , student : a few of my dreams are to adopt a child from a foreign country and give them a home , a lot better home than they could 've had			0
@entity108 , student : one of my dreams is to possibly design and run lighting for large theatrical productions			0
@entity111 was a great man and inspired me and many other people for wonderful dreams			1
@entity25 : not the only way that people paid tribute to the civil rights leader this weekend			0
as @entity119 reported yesterday , @entity23 all across the country took part in community service projects and honored dr. @entity111 's legacy			1
( begin video ) @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 : at a @entity126 middle school , president @entity127 and first lady @entity128 worked with a mentoring program on a service project , a @entity71 tradition for the first family			1
@entity23 president @entity127 : @entity128 and @entity134 and the girls are extraordinarily proud that each year on martin luther king 's birthday , this is how we celebrate , is making sure that we 're giving a little something back to the community			1
@entity141 : it 's been nearly 43 years since the civil rights leader was assassinated at a hotel in @entity145 before a protest march			1
in @entity66 , not far from @entity111 's childhood home , family members laid flowers at the gravesite where @entity111 and his wife @entity152 are buried			1
today marks the 25th anniversary of the martin luther king holiday			1
in 1994 , @entity50 designated it a national day of service			0
@entity157 , who was with @entity111 at the time of his death , says his dream has not been fully realized			1
@entity157 , @entity161 : he would be delighted to know we 've come to a higher level of socialization enough to vote for each other across lines of race , gender and religion			0
and so , president @entity127 is in @entity126 today as head of state			1
he would find delight in that			0
but then on the other hand , the issue of violence , the shooting of congresswoman @entity26 , it simply illuminates , we pray to @entity180 for her recovery , but it illuminates just how much more violent we 've become			0
@entity141 : back in the nation 's capital , a memorial honoring dr. @entity111 is scheduled for completion later this year			1
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity119			0
( @entity188 ) @entity189 @entity190 , @entity16 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm a country located in northern @entity192 between @entity193 and @entity194			0
i got my independence from @entity197 in the 1950s			0
my capital city is @entity199			0
i 'm @entity6 , and i 'm home to around 10.5 million people			0
protests in @entity6 @entity25 : @entity6 is forming a new government that 'll be responsible for leading the country to new elections			0
all of this is coming after weeks of riots and protests			0
people are upset about bad living conditions , high unemployment and accusations of government corruption			0
there 's been fighting between protesters and police			1
and the @entity6 president -- who 'd been president for 23 years -- was forced out of power			0
why does this matter to @entity23 ? well , for one , the @entity23 and @entity6 are close allies , especially when it comes to fighting terrorists			1
another concern : before all of this started , @entity6 was considered a pretty safe and stable country			0
some experts argue that what 's happening in @entity6 could inspire similar protests in other countries			2
what 's the @entity230 ? @entity231 , @entity16 : what 's the @entity230 ? a type of financial aid that students earn through academic achievement scholarship that 's the word ! @entity239 @entity25 : well , here in @entity8 , we have something called the @entity243			1
it 's for students who do well in high school and go to college in state			1
but the scholarship is facing some potential challenges			1
@entity251 heads to @entity7 and my alma mater -- the @entity252 -- to look at how @entity243 has helped , and why the scholarship could be in trouble			2
( begin video ) @entity257 , @entity252 junior : go @entity259 ! @entity260 , @entity0 anchor : @entity252 junior @entity262 beams with school pride			0
she is a @entity264 through and through			0
she 's also a @entity243 scholarship recipient , and that means she does n't pay a dime toward tuition			1
@entity269 : initially , i was actually looking at going out of state			2
but once i saw the numbers of out - of - state at some schools and then paying in - state and not having to pay for that tuition , so just paying for housing and books and some of the fees , it was really a no - brainer			2
@entity282 : a no - brainer to more than a million @entity8 students who have taken advantage of the scholarship since it was introduced in 1993			1
here 's how it works : earn a 3.0 grade point average in an in - state high school and maintain your grades at college			1
amounts vary , but some students can get up to $ 6,000 a year for tuition , fees and books at any eligible @entity8 university or technical school			1
it 's funded by the state lottery , but demand is high and more money is going out than coming in			1
lawmakers are dipping into reserves , scrambling to cover costs			0
and @entity8 's new @entity58 governor says something needs to change			1
gov. @entity310 , ( r ) @entity252 : i am dedicated to honoring the promise that has been made to our students through hope and will work with the general assembly to tailor the program to the financial realities that we face today			1
@entity282 : other legislatures in other parts of the country are watching for @entity8 's next move			1
more than a dozen other states modeled their own scholarship programs on @entity243			2
many of them are now caught in the same kind of budget crunch			0
@entity328 , associate vice president , @entity330 : i do n't know that any other program is identical to what we have in @entity8 , nor has it been around as long and had a chance to grow			1
so , they 're watching us carefully , and we 're hoping that we 'll be able to to preserve this so that students and families will be as impacted as least as possible given the current economic situation			2
@entity282 : spend a day in this college town , and you 'll be hard pressed to find a @entity8 student who has n't benefited from @entity243			1
freshman @entity344 says the opportunity has been a life - changer			0
@entity347 , college freshman : it 's pretty much the only way i was going to be able to go to college			2
@entity282 : and unfortunately , her family is n't banking on the scholarship for the younger siblings			2
@entity357 , @entity347 's mother : i 've got a 10 - year - old also and 5 - year - old			2
i 'm not really counting on hope being there in eight years or 13 years for them			0
( @entity188 ) promo @entity25 : want to expand your geographic genius ? you know you do			0
our downloadable maps : just what you 're looking for			0
you can go to @entity368 every day and use these free resources to help you pinpoint locations in the headlines , like today 's maps for @entity7 , @entity4 and @entity6			1
they 're always free , always at @entity368 ! before we go @entity25 : and before we go , we have a truly memorable musical performance for you			0
@entity376 , 8 - year - old @entity377 : the bombs bursting in air , gave proof ... @entity25 : eight - year - old @entity381 did n't quit singing ; her microphone quit working			0
it died partway through her performance of the national anthem			0
and eventually ... she got some help			0
the crowd came to the rescue ! and the awesome anthem was captured in this @entity392 video			0
goodbye @entity25 : of course , the video has turned @entity381 into a bit of a star			0
she certainly is a bright spot			0
you know , like a spangle			0
and it 's easy to see why after that banner performance			2
star ... @entity402 ... and @entity403			0
well , we 'll wave goodbye and see you tomorrow			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity18 .			0
