-- professor @entity1 is n't short of admirers for his autonomous flying robots and the amazing tricks they perform			1
every week , he receives a flood of e-mails from excited people telling him how to use them , he says			0
" folks have contacted me about using them to deliver burritos and pizzas , paint walls , do search and rescue , monitor the environment , flying cameras for movies ... it 's just endless , " @entity1 says			1
" i 'm not going to pass judgment on whether they are good or bad ... my role is to show people what is possible			0
" it appears those possibilities are growing by the day at the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) where @entity1 leads a team of researchers at the @entity27 ( @entity28 )			1
set up by @entity1 five years ago , the arena offers a " sandbox environment " for testing a fleet of progressively acrobatic quadrocopters			1
in the beginning , these four - rotor machines learned to flip through 360 - degrees , " dance " to music and even play the piano			0
today , increasingly complex flight maneuvers are being attempted as quadrocopters work together to build a six - meter tall model tower and juggle balls and poles			1
it is an extraordinary and slightly befuddling sight to behold			0
read : billion dollar mission to reach the @entity47 's mantle quadrocopters are controlled by varying the relative speed of each rotor blades , or pairs of rotor blades to generate thrust and control pitch , roll and yaw			1
they 've been around for a long time , says @entity1 , but what 's making them so popular now as a creative tool is the shrinking size and cost of technology			1
" in order to fly these things you need gyros			0
only recently have they become small , accurate , and cheap enough to put on these vehicles , " he explains			0
the tiny motors driving each rotor are also extremely powerful and cheap now , he says , as are the batteries			0
last month , @entity24 released video footage of their latest stunt showing a quadrocopter balancing a pole before tossing it to another quadrocopter which successfully catches and controls the pole			1
" we tried various catching maneuvers , " said grad student @entity81 , who @entity1 and a colleague supervised during the research , " but none of them worked until we introduced a learning algorithm , which adapts parameters of the catching trajectory to eliminate systematic errors			1
" it took @entity81 around three months to perfect the move , @entity1 says , but the infrastructure behind the @entity28 has taken much longer to build up			1
draped in protective netting and crash mats , the @entity28 looks like a rather down - at - heal gymnasium on first inspection , but a closer look reveals a high - tech suite of equipment which is crucial to understanding how the @entity24 's quadrocopters fly			1
atop the 10 - meter cubed space sits a motion capture system ( made up of eight cameras ) which locate objects in the @entity28 at rates of more than 200 frames per second			0
the data from this indoor gps system is sent to computers where custom - built software sends commands to the quadrocopters via wifi			2
read : scientists build human brain inside a supercomputer " @entity119 is a very complex phenomena to model properly			0
if we can create machines that learn and adapt what they are doing in aerobatics it pushes use towards more intelligent systems			2
it 's a great research challenge , " @entity1 says			1
within five years he expects to see a proliferation of flying machines being used in a variety of settings			2
there are already companies exploring flying vehicles for inspection and for humanitarian purposes			2
in the case of the latter , he points to the efforts of @entity143 - based start - up @entity142			0
founded by @entity144 , the company have ambitious plans to build a network of autonomous vehicles delivering food and aid to inaccessible areas in developing countries			2
in between in his other projects at @entity24 , which include developing balancing cubes and actuated wingsuits , @entity1 is also looking for ways to commercialize the university 's innovations			1
he 's currently in the process of starting a company which aims to maximize the potential of their quadrocopters in the arts and entertainment industry			1
if his previous forays into the business world are anything to go by then expect it to be wildly successful			0
in 2003 , @entity1 co-founded @entity170 , applying the knowledge learnt creating a team of soccer - playing robots at @entity175			1
read : search for alien life on @entity47 the company , which provides automated robot systems for warehouses , was sold to @entity181 for $ 775 million in 2012			0
" when we were doing @entity185 ( an international robotics competition ) it did not enter my mind that the learnings i would take from my students i had trained could be used to build a company like @entity170 , " he says			0
" basically , my mode of operation is really to focus on creating things that have never been done before and push the boundaries of what autonomous systems can do			2
in the process , do great research and educate people on how to really make things work and the applications will come			2
" there seems no limit to what autonomous flying robots might be capable of in the future and their unstoppable rise is increasingly causing concern , particularly their use in espionage and warfare			1
suppressing the technology is not an option though , @entity1 argues			1
" i 'm a firm believer that if the military use this technology then it 's just a short step away from everyone using it , " he says			1
" we do n't want the technology to be misused			2
the starting point is that our governments do n't misuse the technology			2
as a society , we should question how much of a role , if any , these robots have in warfare			2
" efforts to outlaw weapon - carrying drones have been gathering speed and support in recent months			0
@entity234 published a report ( @entity236 ) in november 2012 urging governments to pre-emptively ban autonomous weapons			0
another campaign , " @entity240 , " is being mobilized by the @entity241 and is due to launch in april			0
far away from the social and political debates about the misuse of drones , @entity1 is just keen to promote his teaching philosophy and how students should approach learning			1
" i think there needs to be more room for unconstrained creation			1
we need to provide ways for folks , especially at university , to push the boundaries of what technology can do without being concerned about the immediate commercial application , " he says			0
" we should be more concerned about fulfilling our dreams as children			0
what was it we wanted to do as children ? we wanted to fly like birds			0
well , why are n't we doing that ? "			0

@entity1 heads @entity24 's @entity27
arena is at *forefront* of research into autonomous flying robots
quadrocopters learn amazing throwing and catching maneuvers
@entity1 says technology education needs to promote " unconstrained creation "
