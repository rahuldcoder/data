-- @entity1 is to @entity3 wheelchair racing in the @entity4 as @entity5 is to swimming in the @entity6			1
meeting this unassuming 33 - year - old , you would n't know that he 's one of the winningest @entity4 @entity3 athletes on @entity10 but @entity1 's victories -- six gold , two silver and two bronze medals and six @entity15 wins -- did n't come easily for him			1
born with a spinal cord transection ( shearing or compression of the spinal cord ) that left him with feeling in his legs but no movement , @entity1 had to carve his own path to becoming the sports star he always hoped he could be			1
@entity0 sat down with @entity1 after a recent training session in @entity26 : @entity0 : what was it about sports that always appealed to you ? @entity1 : my family was very sports - oriented			1
my brothers were boxers -- one was professional ; one was amateur			2
i just got the bug for sports at an early age			2
so i used to go see them fight when i was like 4 years old			2
i decided i wanted to do sports , but obviously i could n't do boxing or football , which were my love , so i had to find a sport that was suitable for my needs			2
@entity0 : you 've won 10 @entity3 medals ; you 've won the @entity15 six times , and you 've won the @entity47			1
what drives you ? @entity1 : i do n't know really			1
i thought i would n't have any drive left after @entity26			0
and i think it 's just the way i ran my races			1
i won them convincingly , with a big gap			0
i did n't win them by millimeters or ( a ) photo finish like i 've done previous years leading up to @entity26			0
when i started fully focusing ( on ) training for @entity26 , and training with the cyclists you 've seen today , i got that extra bit out of me			0
after the games , i watched my races back and saw that i was winning by a good margin , and i think that just showed me that " hold up , @entity66 , there 's still a bit of life in you			2
" @entity71 delivers unexpected legacy @entity0 : you 're working on starting an academy with your coach @entity75 to help train future wheelchair athletes			1
why ? @entity1 : i 'm just more of a mentor -- i try and get down there as much as i can , but @entity75 is the one that does the full program ; she 's brilliant with them			1
i 'm just there to encourage them really , give them advice and tactics , and a way to push and way to sit in their racing chair , because i 've got a lot of knowledge over the years			0
so i 'm just trying to give back what i know to the next generation coming through because @entity95 has a great tradition of wheelchair racers over the years , so i do n't want to see it die			2
so i 'm trying to give back what i had as a youngster			0
@entity0 : you 're @entity1 the athlete , but there 's also @entity1 the father			1
what do your kids think about all of this ? @entity1 : well , my youngest children have n't got a clue at the moment because they 're too young , but my oldest girl who 's 10 -- she 's so proud and happy for me , and obviously my girlfriend is so supportive			1
they 're just the world to me			0
it 's another training tool -- when @entity116 was born and if i 'd have a bad training session , i 'd go back and see his smiley , happy face , and i would forget about that training session and move on to the next day			1
@entity0 : any plans for @entity122 in 2016 ? @entity1 : each month as it gets closer , i seem to change my mind if i 'm going to @entity122			1
i want to do small targets first , really			0
i 'll be 34 this year			0
i need to have an offish year so i can do what races i really want to do			0
but i 'm going to have a two - year target , i think , because i think if i say yes , i 'm definitely in for @entity122			0
it 's a lot of pressure on me , and four years is a long time when you 're 34			2
so i 'm going to take each year as it comes really , and make my decision near the time i think , but if you asked me six , seven months ago , i would have said no way -- @entity26 was my last big target			0
we 'll see how it goes -- if i can still win races and perform at a high level , i ca n't see why not			0
come and ask me in six months ' time ; i 'll probably give you a totally different answer then .			0
