editor 's note : @entity2 , global head of corporate engagement at @entity5 , served as @entity7 assistant secretary of state for educational and cultural affairs from 2005 to 2007			1
@entity2 says there are encouraging signs the world is ready to invest in empowering women			1
@entity12 ( @entity13 ) -- as we mark @entity16 in march , it is encouraging to see that the movement to recognize the vital role that women play in families , nations and economies has been building for more than a decade and that developments in the past few years have shown that real progress has begun to take hold			1
on the heels of @entity28 , president @entity26 said monday , " we will not sow the seeds for a brighter future or reap the benefits of the change we need without the full and active participation of women around the world			2
" he also recently announced the creation of a new position , ambassador - at - large for global women 's issues , at the @entity40			1
to fill this critical role , the president nominated @entity43 , a widely respected women 's advocate and former top aide to then first lady @entity46			1
@entity43 was a founder of @entity47 , an organization committed to empowering women and recently co-chaired by @entity46 and sen. @entity49 , @entity50			2
there has also been very recent progress on @entity53			0
last month , the @entity54 created a @entity56 subcommittee that will focus on the global status of women , led by sen. @entity59 , @entity60			1
the efforts have been a bipartisan priority for our leaders			0
in 2008 , then - secretary of state @entity65 successfully led the effort in the @entity67 to officially recognize rape as a weapon of war			0
and in 2001 , @entity71 used the first presidential radio address ever given by a first lady to focus international attention on the plight of women in @entity77 and used her influence to protect and empower women around the world			2
critical strides are also being made globally			0
in @entity82 , a country devastated by genocide , women have become a key part of the nation 's rebirth			1
under the leadership of president @entity90 , more than half of the parliament is made up of women			2
in @entity93 , president @entity92 made history when she became the first female president on the @entity97 continent			0
in the @entity99 , @entity98 has emerged as a leader in women 's suffrage and political participation			1
and in the @entity105 , women such as @entity104 , minister of foreign trade , have been trailblazers for progress throughout the region			2
this social change is being promoted at the @entity110 , where @entity111 ban ki - moon recently noted that the protection , education and empowerment of women and girls are among the most important ingredients to achieving all other @entity118			1
such consensus should not be surprising as study after study has found that investing in the education of women improves lives			1
every extra year of girls ' education can reduce infant mortality by 5 to 10 percent			1
in @entity97 , children of mothers who receive five years of primary education are 40 percent more likely to live beyond age 5			2
and multicountry data show educated mothers are about 50 percent more likely to immunize their children than uneducated mothers are			0
but one of the most important developments of recent years has been the increasing amount of research that shows investments in women can offer not only social benefits , but also real economic growth			1
a growing body of evidence highlights the economic advantage of educating and empowering women			1
the private sector has seized on this data			0
there is now broad consensus that investing in women is not only just good social policy , it is " smart economics , " as @entity156 , president of the @entity157 , says			1
toward that end , the @entity157 has convened a @entity159 with companies committed to these issues , such as @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 , @entity165 , @entity166 and @entity167			0
my own firm , @entity5 , published two critical pieces of research , " @entity172 " and " @entity173 , " which found that investments in women -- through increased education and labor force participation -- can lead to real economic growth in developed and developing countries			1
specifically , this research found that a 1 percentage point increase in female education raises the average level of gross domestic product by .37 and raises annual gdp growth rates by .2 on average			1
such findings led to the development of 10,000 women , an initiative that is working with a global network of leading academic and nonprofit partners to provide women at home and abroad with quality management and entrepreneurial education			2
this education is helping to create a greater number of female - owned small and medium enterprises , and a new generation of leaders poised to have exponential impact			0
one recent graduate of the program , @entity203 , a fashion designer from @entity204 , has already increased her revenues , and immediately invested a portion of her profits to provide tutors for the illiterate male tailors she employs			0
this not only positions her enterprise for greater growth , but is also a perfect demonstration of the multiplier effect of investing in women			1
organizations such as @entity219 , @entity220 and the @entity221 have long touted this multiplier effect and are supported by private - public partnerships dedicated to the promotion of women leaders			0
for example , the @entity40 , with the help of @entity47 , instituted a mentoring program for the past four years with @entity230 's @entity229			0
the program pairs leading @entity7 executives -- such as @entity233 ( @entity234 ) , @entity235 ( @entity236 ) , @entity237 ( @entity238 ) and @entity239 ( @entity240 ) -- with rising female entrepreneurs in developing countries			2
at the dawn of the 20th century , @entity244 poet @entity243 said : " when you educate a woman , you create a nation			0
" nearly a century later , the cause of women 's empowerment has never been more important			1
as @entity254 columnist @entity253 recently put it , gender inequality is " the dominant moral challenge we face in the 21st century			0
" this challenge also presents an opportunity we can not afford to squander			0
we should seize this moment and this momentum			0
there is tremendous work to be done , but history has shown us that women will not let us down			0
they will take up the challenge and build up their families , their villages and ultimately all our nations			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : as we mark women 's month , there are encouraging signs
both parties in the @entity7 are taking steps to invest in the role of women , she says
she says studies show that more education *decreases* infant mortality
investing in women 's education leads to increases in economic growth , she says
