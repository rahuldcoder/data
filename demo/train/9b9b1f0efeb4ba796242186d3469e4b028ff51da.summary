an @entity4 woman stands in front of posters of captured soldiers sunday in @entity0			1
" it 's not an easy decision , " @entity14 told @entity1			0
" one of the people being released is a brutal murderer , a man that with his own hands killed infants -- a terrible crime , but this is a nasty business			0
" he was referring to @entity24 , the longest - serving @entity25 prisoner in @entity4 , who is hailed as a hero by @entity27			1
@entity24 was convicted for a 1979 attack in which he shot and killed an @entity4 man in front of his 4 - year - old daughter before smashing her head against a rock and tossing her into the sea			2
the victim 's 2 - year - old daughter was accidentally smothered by her mother , who tried to keep her quiet as they hid from the attackers			0
@entity24 was convicted for murdering both children in the attack , which the @entity43 orchestrated to protest the signing of the @entity46 - @entity4 peace treaty at @entity47 the previous year			2
@entity24 is one of five @entity25 prisoners who @entity4 will release in exchange for two @entity4 soldiers , @entity51 and @entity52			1
the @entity25 - based @entity54 militant group kindapped the two in a july 2006 raid into northern @entity4 that left three other @entity4 soldiers dead			1
@entity27 never gave @entity4 any indication whether they survived the attack , which sparked a 34 - day war , leaving the families in limbo			0
before the vote , @entity4 prime minister @entity63 told his @entity65 that the two soldiers are not alive , " as far as we know			1
" " we 'll have a final answer when they are returned , " @entity14 said			0
@entity51 and @entity14 are at the center of the landmark agreement , which has been years in the making , with both sides using the prisoners and intelligence as bartering chips			0
under the deal , which the @entity65 approved 22 - 3 on sunday , @entity27 will also release information about @entity78 , an @entity4 navigator who has been missing since he was forced to eject from his plane over @entity25 in october 1986			1
" we have an obligation , a moral obligation to their families to bring finality , " @entity14 said			0
" that if they are in fact no longer living , that their families can have a funeral , that they can have a grave , that they can know that this is over			0
" @entity4 has repeatedly attempted to get information about @entity78 and other missing airmen by using @entity25 detainees as leverage			1
former prime minister @entity96 promised the @entity78 family that @entity24 will not be released unless @entity27 provides information on @entity78			1
in addition to @entity24 and other @entity25 prisoners , @entity4 will also release @entity102 prisoners and return the remains of dozens of border infiltrators and eight @entity27 members to @entity25 , according to a statement from the government			1
@entity4 will also provide information to the @entity109 about four @entity111 diplomats who disappeared in @entity112 during the 1982 @entity4 invasion , the statement said			0
earlier this month , @entity4 deported a @entity25 - born man who served six years in jail on charges of spying for @entity27			2
in exchange , @entity27 handed over a brown coffin containing the remains of @entity4 soldiers killed during the 2006 war			2
