protesters have occupied major districts in @entity2 to demand full universal suffrage for the city , a culmination of decades of frustration among the city 's democracy activists			1
but as protests in this city enter a stubborn eighth week , there has n't been any real breakthrough			1
protesters continue to stake their ground while the @entity2 police attempt to clear areas of the occupied sites			1
student leaders and government officials have conducted one round of talks with little result , and no new talks are planned			0
here 's our guide to understanding the different players , what they want , and why there 's no easy solution			0
the protest leaders who 's calling the shots ? the real answer is no one			2
last year , law professor @entity34 came up with the idea to " occupy " @entity2 's downtown @entity36 if the government did n't give @entity39 full universal suffrage			1
his @entity42 - inspired group is called " @entity43 with @entity44 and @entity45			0
" but @entity43 did n't kick off the current protests			0
things blew up in late september after three pro-democracy student leaders were briefly arrested at the end of a class boycott , and their supporters tear gassed			0
that 's when tens of thousands of protesters spontaneously came out to occupy @entity2 's streets , leading to the situation we have now			1
the most famous student leader is a skinny 17 - year - old named @entity58 -- he leads a group of high school firebrands called @entity61 , and enjoys popular support among protesters			2
also arrested were @entity64 and @entity65 from the @entity66 ( @entity66 ) , representing university students			0
@entity64 and @entity65 are asking protesters to continue occupying the streets until the government offers a meaningful promise of electoral reform			2
on november 15 , @entity64 and two other members of @entity66 attempted to fly to @entity74 to deliver protesters ' demands to @entity78 leaders , but were prevented from boarding an airplane after their travel permits were declared invalid			1
the students have one main demand : to bring " real universal suffrage and real democracy " to the city			0
the encampments the occupied sites are fragile but sophisticated self - governed communities			0
while @entity34 may have come up with the idea to " occupy " and student leaders incited the protest , citizen protesters have now taken ownership of the movement , which they view as organic and leaderless			2
the number of protesters at the main camp varies , but when crowds are large it can feel like a cross between a summer music festival and a post-apocalyptic settlement			0
the site sprawls across an eight - lane highway in @entity2 's @entity106 district , spilling out into side streets fortified by makeshift barricades			1
a well - oiled volunteer system manages supplies , recycling and first - aid			0
each night , protesters sleep in colorful tents on the pavement			0
three miles north , protesters have occupied some of the busiest streets in @entity119 , a gritty , working - class shopping district famous for its thumping nightlife and triad ties			0
the atmosphere here is more riotous			0
in early october , the encampment was attacked by crowds of older men who tore down tents , attacked students , and allegedly sexually assaulted women in broad daylight			0
outraged supporters have rallied to the camp 's defense , while police have struggled -- and often failed -- to keep the peace			2
in mid-october , the @entity119 camp was cleared by around 500 - 600 police in a dawn raid			2
however , protesters returned in huge numbers the next day and reoccupied the streets after a series of tense clashes with police			2
no major police action has been attempted since , and protesters show no signs they 're willing to leave			2
there is a third , smaller encampment in @entity153 , @entity2 's shopping district , which stretches across one lane of a busy road			1
@entity2 's leader @entity157 , @entity2 's chief executive , is hated with a passion by the city 's pro-democracy citizens , who view him as an sly , imperious puppet of the @entity162			1
and that 's putting it politely			0
his resignation has been a key demand of protesters since they took to the streets a week ago			2
@entity157 has repeatedly said he wo n't step down			0
instead , he has repeatedly asked protesters to disperse , while directing his deputy @entity171 to attempt negotiations with student leaders			0
in late october , @entity174 and four officials met with student leaders from @entity66 for a round of televised talks			0
however , no agreement was reached after the talks , and no new talks are planned			0
it 's doubtful whether @entity157 's administration can make any real concessions to protesters			2
the @entity2 government 's hands are largely tied by @entity74 , which has firmly stated it will not allow @entity2 to have the kind of democracy protesters are calling for			1
anti-occupy @entity39 many hong kongers oppose the occupy protests , and for many different reasons			2
some see the protesters as chasing a pipe dream , others say it 's a mistake to upset @entity74			2
older generations are especially wary of civil unrest , having fled @entity78 , lived through @entity2 's leftist riots in 1967 and witnessed the tiananmen square crackdown on pro-democracy protesters on their television screens in 1989			1
what they all share is a deep disdain for the way today 's protests are affecting the lives of ordinary citizens			2
with roads blocked , traffic has been snarled , commutes have been disrupted			0
in @entity119 , some business owners have reported a dramatic decline in sales			0
a number of @entity220 voices have formed groups			0
former journalist @entity222 calls his group the " @entity223 for @entity2 , " and says the protesters are " holding @entity2 hostage			1
" the police the police 's goal is to return the city to normal , but they miscalculated by using tear gas on student protesters on september 28			1
instead of dispersing the movement , it sparked outrage and caused thousands more protesters to hit the streets			0
since then , police , hesitant to inflame tensions , have adopted a largely hands - off approach to the protest sites			1
in mid-october , police briefly cleared the @entity119 protest site , only for thousands of protesters to reoccupy the site the next day			1
relations between police and protesters also deteriorated when a video showed several plainclothes police officers beating and kicking a detained pro-democracy demonstrator in october			0
triads multiple people with triad backgrounds have been arrested in @entity119 after starting fights and igniting anger between @entity43 and @entity220 protesters			0
@entity2 's triads are known for controlling smuggling , prostitution and illegal gambling rings			1
some of their businesses in @entity119 -- @entity2 's red light district -- have suffered as a result of the occupy protests			1
while pro-democracy legislators and protest leaders have accused the government of sending triad members to disperse the protests , it 's unclear who may have sent the triads or whether they came on their own accord			1
@entity74 @entity78 's president , @entity276 , dreads dissent and separatism			1
as @entity78 's economy continues to grow , he has been eager to project an image of national unity and strength to the world			1
at the @entity284 in november , @entity276 called the protests an " illegal movement " and declared his support for the @entity2 government 's handling of the situation			1
@entity74 has also expressed its views through its state - run media , condemning the protests as " illegal acts " that " are doomed to fail			0
" @entity78 newspapers have dismissed the movement 's potential to spread to the mainland as " no more than a daydream			1
" other news articles , social media posts , and images of @entity2 's protests have been heavily censored in @entity78 : as the first images of the occupation went viral , even @entity306 became inaccessible			1
the memory of @entity78 's 1989 tiananmen square crackdown on pro-democracy protesters has loomed over @entity2 and @entity74 from the start			1
more than once , protesters have wondered whether @entity74 will activate the 6,000 @entity313 troops believed to be stationed in @entity2 -- but so far , there 's been no sign that will happen			1
it 's obvious @entity78 is displeased			1
what 's less certain is how serious of a threat they consider the protests to be .			0

protesters are occupying parts of @entity2 for an eighth week
police have cleared some barricades , *chipping* away at the protest sites
