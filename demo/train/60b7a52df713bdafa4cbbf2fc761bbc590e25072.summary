to my family , i am a husband of 20 years and the boastful father of three			1
to my congregation of nearly 5,000 , i am a pastor			1
to my readers , i am the author of nine christian books			1
to my friends , i am one of the guys			2
and , to so many over the years who have known my story , i am a man in a race -- a race against illness , against fear , against discrimination			1
a race against my own body			2
a hemophiliac since birth , i discovered my @entity24 status at 16			1
it was life - changing news , the result of a contaminated blood supply			1
and , so , the race began			2
it has included many twists and turns : from the joy of marrying my high school sweetheart to the sorrow of being rejected by the first church to which i was appointed as pastor			1
certainly , the race has never been easy			0
it is often long and difficult			0
however , the race now impacts me in so many ways			0
and , oddly enough , i would not trade it with anyone			0
instead , the journey affords me a glimpse into the best of what each of us can become			1
the race has made me a student , and no day goes by that it does n't teach me a lesson			0
about time : a privilege afforded to us to make a difference in this world			0
about relationships : the most important things we do are not done alone			1
about simplicity : more , bigger , nicer , pale in comparison to gifts like sunsets and the laughter of children at play			2
about real meaning ... and about myself : life is more a mosaic than a measurable frame of joys and sorrows , laughter and tears			0
real meaning is discovered through the composition of life 's diversity			0
no color can adequately define a mosaic , any more than one hardship , failure or achievement can define a person 's life			0
the diversity of these images brought together unveil who i really am			0
no matter how i try to describe myself , i am more than the sum of what i can say			1
so , i run ... for those i love and , even , for those i have never met			0
i run to make life matter , seeking more than the right way to go , but actually going there and watching the race mean something .			2

@entity2 is husband and father , author , and a pastor
he is racing against illness and fear : @entity104 is an @entity24 - positive hemophiliac
journey has shown relationships , simplicity , giving are most important
