thursday is judgment day for the @entity1 , with the @entity3 @entity2 expected to release its long awaited ruling on the constitutionality of the law			2
whichever way the @entity2 rules , the decision will be instantly framed in the political context			2
its potential impact on the presidential race , on the upcoming congressional elections and on the trajectory of the political parties will be the subject of endless analysis and debate			0
the electoral handicapping will regrettably overlook the decision 's real - world impact on those whom the law is intended to help			2
at stake in the opinions of nine justices is the well - being of millions of @entity3 living with chronic diseases such as cancer			1
they wake up every day knowing that if they lose their job , if their employer decides to drop their health coverage , or if their insurance company raises premiums , they may be unable to get the lifesaving care they need			2
the debate over health care has been epically divisive			0
but it is almost universally accepted that the existing health care system is badly in need of repair			0
people with cancer and other life - threatening chronic diseases have long been routinely denied coverage outright , charged exorbitant costs for care and forced to spend their savings to get the care they need , simply because they have a pre-existing condition			1
the law addresses this national moral failing with numerous provisions that help to expand access to quality , affordable health care , including those that prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions , charging patients higher premiums because of their health status and suddenly revoking coverage when a person falls ill with a disease such as cancer			1
the law also empowers consumers to make informed choices about their health coverage , requiring insurance companies to issue brief and simple explanations of what their plans cover and creating online marketplaces , or " exchanges , " where people can compare plans and choose the one that is best for them			1
these provisions , which have received broad bipartisan support , hang in the balance before the court			0
so , too , do popular provisions that are currently enabling students and young workers to remain on their parent 's health plan until age 26 , ensuring coverage for children with pre-existing conditions and eliminating arbitrary dollar limits			1
the court 's decision will determine whether the 60,000 people with pre-existing conditions who enrolled in the law 's new high - risk plan after going six months or more without insurance will continue to receive coverage			1
it will either continue or end the new requirement that people receive proven preventive screenings , such as mammograms and colonoscopies , at no cost to them			0
it will decide whether millions of low - income and disabled people with cancer or at risk for cancer will be eligible for quality health coverage under @entity125			1
the pundits will have ample opportunity to pontificate about the ruling 's political implications			0
but no one should lose sight of the impact on those who are most in need of quality care			0
for people and families battling cancer or another serious chronic disease , the upcoming ruling is about much more than politics			1
it could mean the difference between life and death .			0
