-- ten years ago , politicians and pundits liked to say , " 9/11 changed everything			1
" for a while , it seemed true			2
now it seems like a vanished era			2
today , nothing changes anything			1
no matter what happens , our thinking remains frozen exactly in place , impervious to new experience and new evidence			1
on december 14 of last year , a deranged man fatally shot and killed 20 students and six teachers with an assault - style rifle , the second deadliest mass shooting in @entity23 history			2
in response , the country has done ... nothing whatsoever			0
no changes to gun laws			1
no changes in the treatment of the mentally ill. last week , a @entity29 filibuster stopped the milk - and - water @entity33 proposal to tighten ( slightly ) background checks on would - be gun purchasers			1
early in 2013 , @entity37 of the @entity38 reported @entity40 's obsessive fascination with prior mass murders			1
" [ @entity42 ] nvestigators found ... a chilling spreadsheet 7 feet long and 4 feet wide that required a special printer , a document that contained @entity40 's obsessive , extensive research â € ” in nine - point font â € ” about mass murders of the past , and even attempted murders			1
but it was n't just a spreadsheet			1
it was a score sheet			0
' we were told ( @entity55 ) had around 500 people on this sheet , ' a law enforcement veteran told me saturday night			1
' names and the number of people killed and the weapons that were used , even the precise make and model of the weapons			1
it had to have taken years			0
it sounded like a doctoral thesis , that was the quality of the research			0
' " the next would - be mass murderer can take up @entity40 's obsession from where he left off , with not a single new barrier in his way			1
@entity76 ( the deadiest school shooting in @entity23 history back in 2007 ) made no difference			0
the @entity81 movie theater mass murder made no difference			0
the attack on former rep. @entity85 made no difference			0
it 's not just guns			1
with economics too , nothing changes anything			0
over four years , policymakers in @entity94 and the @entity23 have argued about public debt			0
in a recession , should government run deficits to substitute for weakened consumer demand ? or should they cut spending to balance their budgets , accepting pain now to avoid even greater pain later ? republicans in the @entity23 and the @entity107 government in @entity94 have argued for the second option			0
advocates of austerity cited a powerful study by two acclaimed economists , @entity113 and @entity114			1
the @entity118 study demonstrated ( or appeared to demonstrate ) that once public debt climbed past 90 % of @entity120 , a country 's future growth slowed , putting at risk the entire next generation			2
then , last week , a 28 - year - old graduate student demonstrated that the @entity125 study contained a basic spreadsheet error			0
correct the arithmetic , and you found that the connection between public debt and future growth was almost perfectly random : sometimes high - debt countries grew ; sometimes they did n't ; it all depended on other factors			2
the most important piece of advice in favor of the " cut now " school of thought collapsed into rubble			0
and the result ? nothing , barely even a word of acknowledgment from the people who 'd been citing the study and condemning people to the harmful effects of austerity for the past four years			1
on this site a few days ago , @entity0 contributor @entity151 expressed worry that the @entity157 bombing , allegedly by two alienated young immigrants , might harm the prospects for the @entity29 immigration deal			1
the @entity163 massacre changed nothing			2
the @entity165 bombing attempt changed nothing			2
the presence of so many of the 9/11 hijackers on overstayed visas has changed nothing : there is still no mechanism for confirming that persons who enter on visas depart on time			1
why would one expect @entity157 to change anything			1
? the immigration debate has been resisting new information for years , not only in the traumatic and of course rare instances of terrorist acts by immigrants and their children , but even more in labor economics			0
much thinking about immigration remains shaped by statistics from 30 and 40 years ago , when immigrants arrived with higher levels of education than natives and equaled native wages within a decade			0
we do n't need horrifying acts of violence to prove that the @entity23 is choosing its immigrants unwisely			2
until 1970 , immigrants to the @entity23 were better educated than natives			0
immigrants who arrived before 1970 took a decade or so to adjust , but then earned more than natives			0
since 1970 , however , the skill levels of immigrants to the @entity23 has sharply deteriorated			0
relying on data from the @entity198 , the @entity199 observes : -- 23 % of all immigrants and their @entity23 - born children live in poverty , almost double the rate for @entity23 natives ; -- immigrants and their children accounted for one - fourth of all persons living in poverty ; -- immigrant - headed households are 50 % more likely than the native - born to use at least one welfare assistance program , such as food stamps or @entity212			0
yet even so , the president and the @entity29 's " @entity214 " insist : the @entity23 must continue to keep its doors open to the least skilled and ought to actually increase its total immigration intake , as well as granting legal status and eventually citizenship to the present illegal population			2
you might almost call it a testament to human fortitude , if the results were not so perverse and the outcomes so costly			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			1

@entity230 : after the terror attacks of 9/11 , people said they " changed everything "
he says today 's frozen politics means that the @entity157 bombings wo n't change things
he says even the @entity242 killings did n't shift politics enough to widen gun control
@entity246 : advocates of *fiscal* austerity are n't admitting their policies are *faulty*
