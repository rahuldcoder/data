-- when @entity2 visited her friend @entity3 in the hospital last week , she talked to her about the demonstrations in @entity6 and the @entity8 ' proposed budget cuts -- not exactly topics you might expect during a hospital visit			1
but @entity2 says she remembers what she wanted to talk about when she was hospitalized with breast cancer a few years ago			1
" as much as ( @entity3 ' husband , @entity15 ) cares about her , he does n't know all the fun stories about what 's going on in @entity18 , " she said			1
" there 's only 435 of us in the @entity21 , and i knew she 'd want to be caught up on what 's going on , so i told her stories about different colleagues and who said what			2
" in the nearly six weeks since the @entity30 @entity28 was shot , @entity2 , a @entity29 @entity28 , has made three trips to visit her friend : two to @entity33 and one to @entity34 , where @entity3 is in a rehabilitation hospital			1
she 's planning another trip there in a few weeks			1
she fits the travel into her busy schedule because she remembers how important such visits were to her when she was recovering from her seven breast cancer surgeries , including a double mastectomy , breast reconstruction and removal of her ovaries			2
" being hospitalized and sidelined in such a significant way can be so isolating , and @entity47 is even more isolated from the world than i was			1
she 's isolated in her own body while she 's recovering , " she said			2
@entity2 says that even though @entity3 could n't speak to her during a visit two weeks ago , she felt that @entity3 understood what she told her and appreciated the visit			1
" she reacts with facial expressions as she would ordinarily , just without words , " she said			2
" she smiles ; she frowns ; she laughs			2
" when @entity2 tried to think about what gift her friend would most want , the answer was easy : @entity3 would want someone to help take care of the people in her district in @entity30			1
" her constituents are so important to her , and my staff jumped right in to help with constituent services , " she said			2
@entity2 's own constituents say they feel like well - cared - for friends , even when they do n't live near the congresswoman			1
eleven years ago , doctors told @entity68 her 2 - year - old son , @entity69 , was going to die			2
her doctor in @entity29 said there were no more treatments left to treat his congenital disease , called @entity75 's deformity , and @entity29 @entity76 was unwilling to pay for her son to go a surgeon in @entity79 who could help him			0
@entity68 says that not only did @entity2 , then a member of the @entity81 , persuade @entity76 to pay for @entity69 to get treatment in @entity79 , but she 's called and visited him regularly even after moving to @entity18 in 2005 to become a member of @entity84			1
" if it were n't for @entity2 , he 'd be dead , and she did n't have to do any of it , " @entity68 says			1
" she 's a mom to the community			0
" sometimes , when a friend who lives far away has a medical crisis , it 's tough to know how often to visit , what to say or what you can do to help without violating your friend 's and their family 's privacy			1
but @entity2 says that stepping forward can make a huge difference			1
in her case , her friends were " critical " because she received all her care in @entity18 , while her husband , @entity103 , stayed home in @entity29 with their three young children , who were unaware of her breast cancer diagnosis			1
" my mother was with me , but she works full - time and had to get back to work , so my girlfriends came up to be with me and rotated every few days so i 'd always have one of them with me , " she said			0
here are tips from @entity2 and others about how to give your friend the best care you can even when you live far away			1
know your friend if you 're not sure whether your friend wants to you to travel for a visit , ask			2
" everyone deals with illness differently , " @entity2 said			1
" some like to have a lot of interaction , and others are private			0
it really is very unique			0
" in @entity47 's case , she ca n't express her opinion , so @entity15 's got to do it for her , " she said			0
" but in most cases , people can say what they want			0
make specific offers when television reporter @entity134 got ovarian cancer five years ago at age 23 , many friends said something to the effect of " let me know what i can do			0
" to her , that felt like an empty promise			0
" i got very , very bitter			0
everyone said , ' i want to help you , ' but i felt like it was n't real , " she remembered			0
what did help were friends who helped her figure out specifically what she needed			0
in her case , it was a wig -- a good one that cost $ 2,000 that she could wear on tv -- and her friends helped her pay for it			0
@entity134 , an entertainment reporter for @entity160 , has since started @entity161 , where patients can register for the gifts they want , just as couples make a wedding registry			0
give the right gift if you ca n't send yourself to your friend , send the right gift			1
@entity171 has some ideas , including a subscription to an online video rental service or an appointment for pampering at a spa for after the person has been discharged			0
" you should try to put yourself in the person 's shoes when getting a gift , " @entity134 advised			0
" for example , maybe they have a dog , and what they need is a service to walk the dog			0
call at night " know that nighttime is often the hardest time for people in crisis , " psychologist @entity188 writes on her blog			0
" call in the evening to check in			0
call weeks later support often flows in when someone first becomes ill and then wanes when the illness goes on and on			2
@entity188 suggests checking in with your friend weeks or months after the initial health crisis , when others may have stopped calling .			1
