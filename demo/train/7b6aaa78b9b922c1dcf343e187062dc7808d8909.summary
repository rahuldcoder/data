@entity0 @entity2 was dead , but @entity3 came to party			1
official @entity0 was across town last friday , debating federal immigration laws and hashing out details of an enormous spending package that would keep the government funded through next year			2
but a few miles away from the @entity10 , southeast @entity0 had a different agenda			2
adults and school children alike were streaming into the chilly and rain - slicked streets of @entity0 's @entity16 neighborhood , the beating heart of @entity2 's @entity19 political base for almost 50 years , to pay their final respects to the man fondly dubbed " @entity22			1
" a funeral procession that began solemnly in the morning at the city council building in downtown @entity0 blossomed into a block - party - in - motion as the hearse carrying @entity2 's body made a slow roll through his neighborhood , past his white clapboard home and en route to a memorial service at his local church			1
@entity2 's family members and friends honked their car horns incessantly at the crowd and the cameras			1
then they boogied in the streets as the marching band from @entity45 announced themselves with a crisp drumbeat			0
neighborhood entrepreneurs hawked hats and t - shirts emblazoned with @entity2 's portrait and the " @entity22 " slogan for $ 10 a pop. and then there were the stories			1
everyone in @entity3 had a tale about @entity2 — how he helped a neighbor land his first job , how he secured clothing and food for a family in need			2
and , of course , how he liked to have good time -- even when he could n't actually have a good time			0
" the last time i saw @entity2 was at my birthday party , " recalled one mourner , @entity66			2
" that was nov. 14			0
he could not dance , so all the woman stood up and danced in front of him			0
" @entity76 , clutching a framed vintage photograph of herself and a heavier - set @entity2 , remembered the time she and some friends traveled to @entity80 for the 1987 middleweight title bout between @entity82 and " @entity84 " @entity83			2
" a bunch of @entity86 went , " she said			0
" late in the morning , i am walking across the strip			0
and i 'm like , ' hey @entity2 ! hey , d.c. mayor ! @entity2 ! ' he says , ' hey ! do n't nobody up here know i 'm mayor ! you 're blowing my cover ! " to many in white @entity0 , @entity2 was a scoundrel , a womanizer and a crook who enriched his friends and cronies with contracts and jobs , corrupted the police department , and allowed the drug - ridden city to earn an ugly reputation in the 80s and early 90s as " the murder capital			1
" his critics could barely contain their glee when @entity2 was busted smoking crack cocaine in 1990 with his then - girlfriend in an @entity111 - led sting operation at the @entity112			2
" b - tch set me up ! , " @entity2 exclaimed over and over again during his infamous on - camera arrest			2
the girlfriend , @entity115 , was an @entity111 informant			0
the scandal brought an end to a remarkable political run that began in the 1960s			0
@entity2 , a young civil rights leader , arrived in @entity0 from @entity120 , where he worked for the @entity121 and helped organize @entity123 's lunch counter sit - in movement — all while earning a master 's degree in organic chemistry on the side			1
once in the district , @entity2 dove into grassroots politics , launching a popular jobs program for @entity19 teenagers that many black @entity132 remember fondly even today			2
a gifted speaker with an infectious personality , @entity2 left his civil rights activism behind and became a political creature in full			2
he " worked to make friends of his enemies , a trait that would become a trademark , " @entity137 and @entity138 wrote in their book " @entity144 , " the definitive chronicle of @entity2 's political career and the mark it left on @entity0			1
after @entity0 established " home rule " and the right to elect its own leaders in 1973 , @entity2 rode his popularity in the black community to a spot on the @entity156			1
and four years later in 1978 , with early ( and now forgotten ) support from white voters , he was elected mayor			0
flamboyant , resilient and always nurturing his @entity19 - @entity19 base , @entity2 was re-elected two more times before the crack bust heard around the world			0
much to the frustration of white @entity0 , @entity2 launched a stunning comeback after serving time in a federal prison , and won a fourth term as mayor in 1994			1
he declined to run one more time , instead securing a place on the @entity156 until his death last month			0
@entity2 's loss last month was felt deeply by black @entity86 , who celebrated his life with three days of events culminating in a massive memorial service downtown last weekend			1
for all his flaws , @entity2 was a civil rights leader from the era of @entity178 who gave voice to a populace that lived , often forgotten and impoverished , in the shadow of the monuments and federal buildings that so many tourists flock to every year			0
" what a lot of people do n't realize was how many thousands of people in this city loved @entity2 , " said outgoing @entity0 mayor @entity186			1
" he was always trying to work on behalf of the people , especially those who were in difficult circumstances or were disadvantaged			0
he was a fighter and people will always remember it			0
" @entity2 's death can be mourned another way			1
the @entity0 of 2014 looks far different than it did during @entity2 's political heyday			1
it 's whiter and wealthier — and yes , safer — than it was during @entity2 's time in office , when the " @entity200 " was about 70 % @entity19			1
today , that number is around 50 % and falling			0
for all the bike - lines and locally - sourced restaurants and @entity206 coffee proliferating in " cool " @entity0 today , the city had something of a @entity209 quality in the @entity210 and @entity211 that now feels mournfully distant			1
@entity2 came to power when some long forgotten but legitimately crazy stuff was happening in @entity0			1
there was the 1976 car bombing of a @entity217 dissident on @entity218 — his was killed by @entity220 's secret police near @entity221			0
the next year , a dozen @entity223 terrorists stormed three @entity0 buildings in 1977 , including the @entity0 city council office , taking 149 hostages , killing a radio reporter and shooting @entity2 in the chest			1
an ex-con radio disc jokey named @entity230 ruled the radio airwaves			0
@entity232 went to the @entity233			0
and yes , the @entity234 were good			0
that era grows more unimaginable by the day — and @entity2 was the final thread binding us to it .			2

@entity2 's neighborhood paid final respects to the former @entity0 mayor
current @entity0 mayor : ' many thousands of people in this city loved @entity2 '
