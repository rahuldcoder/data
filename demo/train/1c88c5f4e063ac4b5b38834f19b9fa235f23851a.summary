@entity0 -- an independent review of the september 11 attacks on the @entity5 @entity4 in @entity6 released tuesday cited " systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies " at the @entity7			1
the attacks killed four @entity5 , including @entity5 ambassador @entity12			1
the failures resulted in a security plan " that was inadequate for @entity6 and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place , " the 39 - page , unclassified version of the report concluded			1
read the independent panel 's full report veteran diplomat @entity24 and former @entity26 chairman adm. @entity25 , both members of the review board , are scheduled to brief members of the @entity31 foreign affairs and @entity30 committees in private on wednesday			1
the board cited a lack of resources as at least partly to blame			2
" the solution requires a more serious and sustained commitment from @entity38 to support @entity7 needs , " it said			1
the board found that @entity0 tended " to overemphasize the positive impact of physical security upgrades ... while generally failing to meet @entity6 's repeated requests " to beef up personnel			2
the board completed its investigation this week and sent a copy monday to secretary of state @entity48 , who said in letters to the heads of those committees that she accepted every one of its 24 recommendations			2
they include strengthening security , adding fire - safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high - threat areas			1
@entity6 siege : the ambassador 's last minutes the report said " there was no protest prior to the attacks , " which it described as " unanticipated in their scale and intensity			1
" it also cited the @entity71 staff as " inadequate " in @entity6 on the day of the attack and in the months and weeks leading up to it , " despite repeated requests from @entity6 and @entity75 for additional staffing			1
" the report said there had been a " lack of transparency , responsiveness , and leadership at the senior levels " in @entity0 , @entity83 and @entity6			1
" security in @entity6 was not recognized and implemented as a ' shared responsibility ' by the bureaus in @entity0 charged with supporting the post , resulting in stove - piped discussions and decisions on policy and security , " it said			2
" that said , @entity75 did not demonstrate strong and sustained advocacy with @entity0 for increased security for @entity95			2
" the report said the short - term nature of the mission 's staff , many of whom were inexperienced @entity5 personnel , " resulted in diminished institutional knowledge , continuity and mission capacity			1
" the mission was also " severely under - resourced with regard to certain needed security equipment , " it said			0
it singled out for criticism the dependence on " poorly skilled " members of the @entity114 february 17 @entity113 and unarmed local guards who were supposed to provide security			0
it noted that , at the time of @entity12 ' visit , militia members " had stopped accompanying special mission vehicle movements in protest over salary and working hours			1
" @entity6 problems suggest long list of changes for security of diplomats though it said there had been no specific , credible threats on the day of the attack , the significance of the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001 had led @entity12 to decide to hold meetings on the compound on september 11 of this year			1
but security systems and the @entity114 response " fell short " when the compound came was penetrated " by dozens of armed attackers			0
" the report offers a detailed description of what happened that night			2
it said @entity114 mission guards were not present , local militia fled their posts and " there simply was not enough time for armed @entity5 military assets to have made a difference			0
" the board said it could not determine how a gate at the compound was breached , " but the speed with which attackers entered raised the possibility " that the guards had left it open			0
@entity158 , assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security , and @entity160 , deputy assistant secretary of state for international programs , oversaw decisions on security at the diplomatic outpost			0
@entity165 testified before @entity38 about the security precautions			0
documents show @entity165 denied repeated requests for additional security in @entity114			0
despite all the criticism , the board found no @entity5 government employee had engaged in misconduct or ignored responsibilities and did not recommend any individual be disciplined			0
@entity176 , who is recovering from a stomach virus and concussion , ordered the review in the aftermath of the attack			0
such reports are mandated by @entity38 when @entity5 working on behalf of the @entity5 government are killed overseas			0
@entity7 : @entity176 not dodging @entity6 hearings a notice sent to @entity7 employees said the implementation team had met tuesday and would continue to do so regularly to carry out the board 's recommendations			1
the politics surrounding the events that led to the report have claimed one political casualty , with @entity194 , @entity5 ambassador to the @entity195 , last week pulling her name from consideration to succeed @entity176			2
some @entity199 senators had said they would put a hold on her nomination if president @entity203 had submitted it , based on comments @entity205 made in the days after the attack			0
in place of @entity176 , deputy secretaries of state @entity207 and @entity208 will testify before the @entity31 and @entity30 committees thursday			0
