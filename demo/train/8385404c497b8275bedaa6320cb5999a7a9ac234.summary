@entity0 -- six astronauts lie motionless in a row of compartments with medical monitoring cables connected to their bodies , as their space ship cuts through the silent blackness that separates @entity9 from @entity10			1
they 're sound asleep and will be for the extent of their six - month trip , having been placed in an artificially induced state of hibernation called torpor			1
this is the way a @entity19 - funded study sees space explorers traveling to @entity10 -- unconscious , with their metabolism switched into slow motion			1
sending astronauts that far into space would be too challenging , costly and grueling without it , says space engineer @entity27 , whose @entity0 - based company @entity29 wrote the study for @entity19			1
" ultimately , it 's what we 'll have to do , " he says			2
@entity34 becomes reality sleeper spacecraft with crews in suspended animation have been flying through futuristic science fiction movies like " @entity40 , " " alien , " " @entity41 " and " 2001 : @entity42 " for decades			2
now science reality is catching up , as medical advances have made stasis possible via a method called therapeutic hypothermia			1
it has been used since the early 2000s to treat patients with traumatic injuries			1
@entity53 racer @entity52 , for example , who suffered a brain injury while snow skiing , was reportedly put into therapeutic hypothermia			1
it renders the patient unconscious by lowering the body temperature			2
in @entity52 's case , it also prevented swelling of his brain			2
the torpor stasis , which greatly slows metabolism , can help injured patients survive longer , while medical teams work to rescue them , @entity27 says			1
but doctors usually induce it for only three or four days at a time , not the 180 days it would take for astronauts to get to @entity10 , nor the 180 it would take to get back to @entity9			1
" it may take some time to get it to the state of effectiveness we want it to go to , " @entity27 says			0
that involves animal testing , then some extended testing on humans , perhaps on the @entity83			0
@entity86 spacecraft enters @entity10 orbit to explore its climate change a short - cut there is a possible work - around , though , that astronauts could start out with			1
@entity92 found a @entity94 medical study in which trauma patients stayed in torpor for longer periods			1
" they had a sample of about 80 people that went through therapeutic hypothermia for all sorts of traumatic injuries			1
and those periods did range from three to up to 14 days			0
" the patients who stayed under for two weeks fared as well as those who were put under for a shorter time			2
two weeks is a time frame @entity29 can live with and one that @entity27 says his medical partners at the @entity110 and @entity111 are more comfortable with			2
aboard the spacecraft here 's how it would work during space flight			0
the two - week torpor periods would be straddled , so that there is always one astronaut who is awake for a brief period			2
the colleague currently awake could check in on the other ones who are still unconscious to make sure their intravenous feeding tubes are clear , and urine removal systems and so on are working properly			2
he can also communicate with @entity9			0
" he can check emails , " @entity27 says			0
then after two or three days , he wakes up the next astronaut by activating a heating system that brings his or her body temperature up to normal			0
then the awakened astronaut straps the other into the hibernation module , hooks up the medical systems and inserts a body cooling tube through a nostril			1
heating pads behind the astronaut make sure the nasal tube does n't cool down their body too much			0
a temperature drop of only about five degrees @entity142 is necessary -- from 98.6 to about 93 degrees			0
trace amounts of sedatives in the feeding line would suppress the astronaut 's shiver reflex			0
the habitat unit housing the sleepers would rotate to create centrifugal force simulating gravity			0
that would help to mitigate the reduction in bone density that naturally occurs in zero gravity			0
how long until this is scenario is reality ? less than 30 years , @entity27 thinks			0
" i think it 's something that can and will be used on the first mission to @entity10			1
" @entity10 rover reaches key destination lighter , easier , happier getting astronauts to hibernate like bears makes the mission much easier and more affordable , @entity27 says			1
they can be stacked up in small habitats ; with minimal metabolism , they do n't need as much food , no daily change of clothes			0
exercise equipment is replaced by electrodes that stimulate their muscles while they 're asleep			0
that saves lots of space and altogether more than half the weight of the fully equipped rocket that it would take to transport a crew that was not sleeping through the voyage in torpor			2
and it would be more pleasant for the crew			0
astronauts traveling in waking condition would likely arrive in decent physical shape , but " mentally , i 'd worry about them , " @entity27 says			2
" you 're going to be in a pretty tight space -- nothing as voluminous as the @entity83 -- for the mission , " he said			0
space is dark and feels isolating			0
in june 2010 , @entity200 's space agency simulated a trip to @entity10 by closing up astronauts in a mock space ship for about a year and a half to see how it affected them psychologically			1
they became reclusive , got depressed and slept 12 to 14 hours a day because there was nothing to do , @entity27 said			0
@entity19 's next @entity10 rover will make oxygen , look for farmland ultimate goal ? after six months of travel to @entity10 , the astronauts would face a 500 - day mission on the barren planet 's surface , according to @entity29 ' assessment			1
then they 'd have to endure another 180 days in the cramped rocket to get home to @entity9			0
ideally , @entity221 would like to see the astronauts complete both travel phases in torpor stasis and not even have to wake up every two weeks			1
therapeutic hypothermia would also allow space agencies to pack more astronauts into one ship			1
that 's vital to meeting an often - mentioned possible ultimate goal for travel to @entity10 , he says			1
" if we 're looking at colonizing , you 've to do more than send six or eight people every year			0

a study done for @entity19 *foresees* astronauts being unconscious for @entity10 travel
it would use a medical method called therapeutic hypothermia
it is usually used to save trauma patients by inducing torpor , a type of hibernation
the study says it would be better for the astronauts and *deeply* cut costs
