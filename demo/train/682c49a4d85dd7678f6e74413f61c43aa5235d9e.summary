-- @entity2 's @entity1 knows how much time web designers spend agonizing over color and font - width choices when laying out an application			1
so when he started @entity2 's accessibility push two years ago , he had a tough time arousing sympathy for engineers grousing about how much extra time was needed to create accessibility features			1
fortunately for @entity1 , @entity2 's accessibility manager , he 's running into that problem less and less			2
web designers are starting to take accessibility as seriously as button placement or heading layout when they develop their products , improving the @entity22 experience not only for people like @entity1 -- who lost his sight at the age of five -- but for web users in general			1
" we 're seeing a lot more awareness and involvement in web accessibility than we did a few years ago , particularly among big companies , " said @entity27 , director of the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) at the @entity29			1
" it 's becoming a solid business expectation that web sites need to meet the needs of all users			0
" at the two biggest @entity42 companies in the world , accessibility is seen as an increasingly important part of what they do			0
@entity2 requires every new hire to receive accessibility training from @entity1 and @entity49 , senior policy director of special communities			0
and it books engineering teams for tours of their @entity53 @entity55 recently rolled out a service that will let @entity58 users add captions to their videos , and believes that as the @entity22 moves more from an era of presentation to an era of two - way " data - driven " communication , accessibility becomes even more important , said @entity66 , accessibility program manager			2
web accessibility has come a long way in the decade since many of these proposals were first floated			2
it 's still a challenge , however , for the web community to remember that as it pushes forward with exciting new technologies like @entity76 that could reinvent the @entity42 experience , it must keep in mind the needs of those who ca n't type 60 words per minute , operate a mouse like a scalpel , or see the unobtrusive pop - up windows that point to the next destination on the page			1
" as the @entity22 gets more and more dynamic , the accessibility requirements get more and more interesting , and sometimes challenging , to implement , " @entity87 said			0
the challenges there are about 60 million people in the @entity92 who ca n't use a computer to get on the internet in the normal fashion , said @entity2 's @entity49			1
for those people , a mix of screen reader software , keyboards with special buttons , and even motion - sensing web cameras must take the place of the mouse and qwerty keyboard			2
that can cause problems for web designers who rely too heavily on mouse navigation , or who design pages with special multimedia whiz - bang effects that look cool only to the people that can see them			1
" there can be an assumption of homogeneity on the @entity22 , " said @entity117 , technical program manager for @entity55			0
users of screen readers -- software that essentially reads out loud a description of text , links , and buttons on a page -- are confounded the most by @entity129 and @entity131 web pages , according to a recent survey of screen - reader users conducted by @entity134			2
but simple things like photos or images can also create problems if the web publisher does n't add alt text to those photos , or relies primarily on images as a way of explaining what is happening on the page			1
and as web designers push forward with @entity147 and @entity149 - based technologies that overlay web content over the primary web page , there 's great potential to confuse screen readers			1
the good news is that most of these problems are n't as much technology issues as design issues ; content created with things like @entity131 can be made accessible if designers start off with that principle in mind			1
" there are a bunch of things ( in web design ) that are not features , " said @entity163 , principal front - end engineer for @entity2 's home page , meaning that while you can jazz up a page all you like with additional features , there are certain things that should be standard fare			0
" performance is not a feature , internationalization is not a feature , and accessibility is not a feature			0
" however , features can make the @entity22 more accessible			0
as mentioned , @entity55 recently rolled out automatic captioning software for @entity58 videos , making it much easier for deaf people to enjoy the world 's largest collection of cute cat videos			0
the automatic captioning technology is being rolled out first on @entity58 's educational channel , allowing deaf or hearing - impaired people to take advantage of distance learning programs or other educational systems			0
it 's most definitely a work in progress , but with refinement could really add to the amount of knowledge that can be consumed by disabled people			2
" i wanted this so badly ( that ) it 's good enough , i do n't care if there are some bad captions , " said @entity55 's @entity200 , a deaf software engineer who played an instrumental role in bringing the project to life			0
the reasons there are no explicit laws that companies design web sites to be accessible to the disabled , but many disability experts and web companies believe that portions of the @entity92 @entity217 do apply to the @entity42 , despite having been written several years before the @entity22 emerged as a mainstream phenomenon			1
and in order to do business with the @entity92 government , companies must comply with @entity223 , which insists that electronic and information technology products sold to government agencies be designed with disabled employees in mind , and that government services produced by contractors consider disabled citizens in equal measure			2
but these are businesses , after all : @entity2 's @entity49 estimated that there 's about $ 220 billion in discretionary spending available to disabled people			0
making a web site accessible to as many people as possible is n't just the right thing to do , it also makes business sense , he said			1
also , with a rapidly aging population in many parts of the world -- notably the @entity92 -- accessibility requirements will become useful for today 's crop of baby boomers as they grow older			1
people over 65 are increasing their use of the @entity42 , according to @entity249 , and features designed for accessibility could aid those who are n't technically disabled but would n't mind a little extra help			1
the future the immediate challenge for those working on web accessibility is to ensure that accessibility standards are not trampled in the rush to finalize the @entity76 collection of standards that @entity55 and other web browser companies are currently debating			2
@entity87 said it 's " extremely important to be sure that @entity76 can support accessibility fully , " and her group is working closely with the other parts of the @entity29 to realize that goal			0
but beyond that goal , web accessibility advocates have reason to feel optimistic about their cause			2
long - awaited technologies like sophisticated speech recognition are finally coming to fruition after decades of joking about how such capabilities were just two years away			1
and 46 percent of respondents to the @entity134 survey reported that web content has become more accessible in recent years			0
" anybody should be able to use anything on this page , " said @entity2 's @entity163 , keeper of the all - important @entity2 page			0
" if anybody ca n't use it , it should n't be there			1
