@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 secretary of state @entity4 is urging countries in the @entity8 region to support @entity10 's newly created government as she prepares to head to an international forum on development and the environment			1
" there 's a government in @entity10 that 's embraced by the @entity10 people			1
the attitude toward that government and @entity10 among its @entity20 neighbors is changing			1
more and more people are seeking out relationships , seeking out trade agreements , opening embassies , " @entity21 said			1
in that regard , @entity8 states have " got more to do , but they 're making progress			0
... i 'm encouraged , " she said			0
@entity21 spoke to @entity2 wednesday in @entity0 , @entity1 , a day before she was to meet with regional leaders in @entity32 at the " @entity33			1
" in late december , the @entity10 parliament voted in prime minister @entity36 's government , which is inclusive of @entity10 's major ethnic and sectarian groups			1
the long - awaited legislative action came more than nine months after a hotly disputed national election that threatened to inflame the country 's deep sectarian tensions			0
if other countries in the region do not acknowledge @entity10 's new " inclusive government , " @entity21 said , " that would be a great mistake			1
" " what we see is @entity10 increasingly asserting itself			2
@entity49 is a big neighbor			0
@entity49 is a big presence in this entire region , and obviously , next door to @entity10 as well , " she said			2
" but we also see the other sets of power in the region beginning to step up and make sure that @entity10 is part of the larger community , and that 's very important			1
" she also insisted that progress is being made regarding @entity49 , saying the @entity3 has moved the world from merely condemning @entity49 to enacting sanctions that she says are working			0
@entity21 conceded there 's still a long way to go toward convincing @entity49 to give up its nuclear ambitions			1
" can we run up the flag and say , oh no , we 've reached the conclusion we sought ? not yet , but we are making progress , " she said			0
@entity21 's six - day trip to the region also included a stop in the @entity76			1
before her stop in @entity1 , she made a surprise visit tuesday to poverty - stricken @entity79 , a key @entity82 battleground and planning center in recent years			1
during the wide - ranging interview wednesday , @entity21 defended @entity3 expanded efforts to help @entity79			1
the country has thus far been unable to stop an @entity82 affiliate from operating in its country , where it planned failed bombing attempts on the @entity3			0
" walking away from @entity79 , not supporting it in both the counterterrorism efforts and its broader development needs , would be ceding the ground to @entity96 , " she said			2
" that would be a very tragic mistake			0
" while in @entity79 , she told reporters that the @entity3 wants to take a two - pronged approach to helping that country			2
one is with military assistance to help fight @entity96 , and the other is to provide help for social and economic development as the nation runs out of oil and water			0
" i hope that the @entity3 people understand that this is being done because , first and foremost , this is in our national security interest			0
walking away from @entity79 , not supporting it , in both the counterterrorism efforts and its broader development needs , would be basically ceding the ground to @entity96			2
that would be a very tragic mistake , in my opinion , " she said			0
in her wednesday interview with @entity2 , @entity21 also reiterated her earlier characterization of the weekend shooting rampage outside an @entity126 supermarket as an example of " extremism			1
" " based on what i know , this is a criminal defendant who was , in some ways , motivated by his own political views ; who had a particular animus toward the congresswoman			0
and i think when you cross the line from expressing opinions ... into taking action that 's violent action , that is a hallmark of extremism -- whether it comes from the right , the left , from @entity82 , from anarchists , whoever it is -- that is a form of extremism , " she said			2
also in wednesday 's interview , @entity21 described @entity149 as a " big presence in our world today , " adding the @entity3 needs to have a " positive relationship " with that country because its importance will be even greater in the future			1
@entity149 president @entity157 is set to visit @entity158 next week			0
@entity21 also addressed @entity159 , where members of the powerful @entity162 movement and its allies resigned from the @entity164 wednesday , bringing down the government of prime minister @entity166			2
@entity162 opposes a @entity168 - backed special tribunal that is widely expected to indict members of the @entity170 in the assassination of @entity172 , the current prime minister 's father			0
" we view what happened today as a transparent effort by those forces inside @entity159 as well as interests outside @entity159 to subvert justice and undermine @entity159 's stability and progress , " @entity21 said			1
" trying to bring the government down as a way to undermine the special tribunal is the abdication of responsibility , but it also will not work			0
" @entity2 's @entity187 contributed to this report .			0

@entity21 says more governments should seek relationships with @entity10
she plans to push that point at a meeting *thursday* in @entity32 , she says
@entity21 's trip also includes stops in @entity1 , the @entity76 and @entity79
the secretary of state says that the @entity126 attack is an example of " extremism "
