-- " i hope you have a boy			0
" these were the words of a well - wisher to @entity5 ( then princess @entity6 ) and prince @entity7 on the eve of the birth of their first child in 1948			1
prospects look considerably brighter for royal girls in 2013			1
over the past few weeks , as the craze surrounding the birth of the @entity18 and @entity18 's first - born has reached fever pitch , there 's been very little fantasizing of princes per se			0
if anything , the pendulum now seems to have swung the other way			0
perusing the web , i 've been struck by how many comments indicate a popular preference for a girl			1
to quote one particularly enthusiastic respondent to a recent article on the royal birth , " i 'm personally wishing it to be a girl for the good of the entire human race and the sustainability of the planet			1
" why the shift in sentiment ? in part , the enthusiasm for royal daughters can be attributed to the passage of the @entity43 , which became law in late april 2013			2
the act , greenlighted to save the @entity48 government from the embarrassment of denying the throne to @entity51 and @entity52 's first - born -- should that first - born be a girl -- erases the male preference in royal succession			1
the change in law means that the new royal baby , regardless of its sex , will be third in line to the throne			2
thus , the refreshing banality of @entity52 's recent statement that , " i 'd like to have a boy -- and @entity51 would like a girl ! " from a constitutional perspective , the sex of the child no longer makes a difference			1
there 's another reason for the eagerness , at least in some quarters , for a female heir			2
the very uncontroversial nature of the passage of the @entity43 reflects a particular historical reality in @entity48			1
male preference aside , women have worn the crown there for most of the past two centuries			1
queen @entity81 reigned for almost 64 years ; @entity5 has already clocked in 61			0
that 's a lot of time to get accustomed to female sovereigns			0
and not just accustomed to them , but extremely fond of them in the process			0
while @entity81 's reign ( 1837 - 1901 ) was regarded as an " accident " until the very end , it was an " accident " that most @entity48 came to consider a very happy one			1
as the muckraking journalist @entity95 proclaimed in 1897 , the year of @entity81 's @entity96 , " @entity93 indeed has been fortunate in her @entity94			0
" so confident was @entity95 in queens ' abilities to lead the @entity48 nation that he would go on to note that , " many a time and oft has the idea recurred in these later years whether by some inversion of the @entity107 law our dynastic line could be made to pass only through female sovereigns			1
this being past praying for , we shall do well to make the most of our good @entity94 when we have them			0
" surely there was something overly compensatory about @entity95 's remarks			0
@entity81 's reigns , under the terms of the old succession laws , were always understood to some extent as aberrational			2
as @entity81 herself once confided to her prime minister , @entity120 , " the queen is a woman herself and knows what an anomaly her own position is			0
" yet the " anomalousness " of female sovereigns was far more of a problem in the early modern period than in the modern time			0
after the @entity131 , @entity48 emerged as a constitutional monarchy , with the king -- or queen -- taking on an increasingly ceremonial or " dignified " function			1
women have shone in this role ( both on and off the throne ) , helping to transform the monarchy into an institution intimately connected with cultural diplomacy , middle - class morality , family life and charity work			2
( @entity6 is currently involved with more than 600 different charities			0
) historians often describe this as a " feminization " process			0
whatever it is , it 's a role to which women , for a wide range of reasons , are more habituated to playing			2
the real question we should be asking , then , in the days leading up to the royal birth , is not ' boy or girl ? ' it 's whether we would have the same levels of enthusiasm , or at least complacency , regarding a female heir , if that heir were to inherit a position that had significant executive , legislative or judicial powers			2
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			1

@entity171 : popular opinion prefers that prince @entity51 and @entity52 have a girl
@entity171 : the fervor has to do with a new succession law that gives girls equal rights
she says another reason is women have worn the crown in @entity48 in recent history
