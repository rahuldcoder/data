-- latinos , immigrants and native americans experience " a pattern of human right violations " in the @entity7 under @entity9 immigration policies , @entity1 said in a new report			1
a two - year study focusing mostly on @entity12 and @entity13 found that " communities living along the border -- particularly @entity2 and individuals perceived to be of @entity18 origin , and indigenous communities -- are disproportionately affected by a range of immigration control measures , resulting in a pattern of human rights violations , " @entity1 said			1
the report cited the failure of federal and state laws to respect immigrants ' right to life and found that @entity9 citizens of @entity18 descent and native americans are subjected to " discriminatory profiling by federal , state and local law enforcement officials , that result in their being disproportionately targeted for police stops and searches			1
" other breaches of international human rights standards occurred in the access to justice for immigrant survivors of crime and in accountability for state officials and private individuals accused of abusing immigrants ' rights , the group said			1
" all immigrants , irrespective of their legal status , have human rights			1
@entity1 's report shows that the @entity9 is failing in its obligations under international law to ensure these rights , " the report said			1
the group 's report , which urged a suspension and a federal review of all immigration enforcement programs , was criticized and dismissed by @entity9 officials			1
" @entity1 's report is based almost entirely on either outdated information or anonymous anecdotes that can be neither investigated nor resolved , " @entity65 spokesman @entity64 said			2
" moreover , the report does not offer thoughtful , actionable recommendations for improvement but instead calls for the wholesale suspension of immigration enforcement programs nationwide , " @entity64 said			0
federal and state authorities disputed the report 's accusations of racial profiling and other findings			1
" the @entity81 makes a rather general statement of criticism toward all law enforcement in @entity12 , " said @entity79 , spokesman for the @entity80			0
" the @entity80 does not take part in racial profiling			2
" @entity13 state police refer cases to the @entity88 or @entity89 when there is a " reasonable suspicion that a person is in violation of a federal immigration law , " said @entity95 , a spokesman for the @entity96			0
" the state of @entity13 does not have immigration laws			0
however , @entity101 officers do arrest criminal aliens , regardless of country of origin , when they violate state laws , " @entity95 said in a statement			0
the federal @entity107 initiative was designed to prevent racial profiling by having the fingerprints of every person arrested and taken into custody checked against @entity113 criminal records and federal immigration records , @entity64 said			2
that initiative reduces " the risk of discrimination or racial profiling because the program applies to all who are arrested and booked for a crime , including @entity9 citizens and legal permanent residents , " @entity64 said			1
the @entity1 report said monitoring and accountability of immigration and law officers who practice discriminatory profiling is " lacking , " and those officials are " rarely held to account , with the result that such practices have become both commonplace and entrenched , " the report said			2
@entity113 statistics show that bias crimes against @entity2 have increased 40 % from 2003 to 2007 , and about 56 % of bias victims do n't file police reports because they often believe police wo n't help them , @entity1 said			0
" the fact that local law enforcement officials are used to implement federal immigration programs has exacerbated this problem			0
those who do decide to report crimes may still be denied access to justice because law enforcement officials see them not as the victims of crime , but as criminals , " the report said			2
" immigrant victims of crimes such as human trafficking and domestic violence also face obstacles when attempting to access justice and remedies , while the proliferation of recently enacted state laws in @entity12 and other states across the country obstructs immigrants ' ability to access education and essential health care services , " the report added			1
but the federal government said that under a new @entity89 policy , officers exercise " appropriate discretion to ensure victims and witnesses to crimes are not penalized by removal , " @entity64 said			0
the federal agency also developed a policy to protect victims of domestic violence and other offenses and to ensure the crimes are prosecuted , @entity64 said			0
the rights group criticized @entity9 border policy for pushing undocumented immigrants to use deadly desert routes as a way to enter the country			1
@entity1 reported as many as 5,287 migration deaths along the border from 1998 to 2008			0
" increasingly , state laws and local policies are creating barriers to or discouraging immigrants from accessing their rights to education and essential health care services , impacting their @entity9 citizen children , " the report said			2
at the same time , the @entity9 government has reported that 14,500 to 17,000 people are trafficked into the country for sexual or labor exploitation , and while the federal government offers so - called t - visas for such trafficking survivors , only 6 % of such visas were actually utilized in 2009 , @entity1 said			1
the report also recommended that the @entity206 should consult with the 26 @entity208 nations along the border and respect and facilitate the use of tribal passports , identification papers and immigration documents for travel across the international lines			0
for example , the @entity218 straddles both countries , including 76 miles of the international line , with 28,000 members in @entity12 , the report said			0
the tribe uses identity cards listing one of five districts to which a @entity9 - born member belongs , while the cards for members born on the @entity232 side list " @entity233 " for " no district , " the report said			1
@entity206 said it is working with tribes to develop forms of identification , and as of january , the federal government has approved six of 12 tribes ' memoranda of understanding to develop tribal identification that is valid for crossing the border , @entity64 said			0
of the six , two tribes , the @entity245 of @entity246 and the @entity247 of @entity12 , have fully approved @entity248 that are accepted as documents to enter the @entity9 , @entity64 said .			0
