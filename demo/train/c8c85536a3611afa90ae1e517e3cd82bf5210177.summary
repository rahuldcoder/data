-- under @entity6 trees around the world , parcels of underpants and bundles of briefs are waiting to be opened -- perhaps with a tinge of dismay -- by the men in your life			0
underwear is a big hitter on the traditional holiday gift list and now soccer stars are muscling into the market			1
@entity20 @entity19 star @entity18 became the latest footballer to tackle branded underwear , launching his @entity24 collection for @entity25 last month and posing semi-naked to show off the goods on offer			1
the 23 - year - old was following the lead of his @entity32 @entity31 teammate @entity30 , whose cr7 underwear label recently celebrated its one - year anniversary			1
@entity36 's pants hit high streets in close to 40 countries when the former @entity40 and @entity41 maestro teamed up with @entity43 fashion store @entity42 in 2012			1
even though he is approaching 40 -- that 's 17 years older than undies rival @entity18 -- @entity36 stripped off again this summer to model his wares			1
but why do footballers choose to branch out their brand in the most intimate way ? " @entity6 comes round once a year but footballers are in the shop window continually , " @entity50 , the global ceo for brand agency @entity51 and @entity52 , told @entity0			1
" underwear is an every day purchase and wearing the right underwear has seen it become something of a lifestyle item			0
" for some of the major players , it 's a natural extension of their individual brand			0
" they do n't need the money			0
it 's not about greed but it is about making the most of their true value over the short period of their career			0
" @entity50 helps manage the branding and marketing for @entity30 's @entity30 range , which he says is available in almost 100 countries -- its main markets are in southern @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 -- as well as online			1

" the core audience [ for the @entity30 range ] is football fans who aspire to @entity30 's look and image , " @entity50 adds			1
" the age range is mainly 18 - 24 year olds and slightly older			0
" the beauty of @entity30 is that he cuts across quite a big demographic			2
" the aesthetic allure of @entity30 , @entity18 and @entity36 is an undeniable factor in why their underwear packs a punch			1
@entity36 stopped traffic as an underwear model for @entity106 before collaborating with @entity42 while the perfectly manicured @entity30 oozes style on and off the pitch			1
@entity18 may still be baby faced but he is already winning awards for his looks , voted the world 's sexiest man in 2014 by @entity115 's " people " magazine			2
when this handsome trio launched their underwear collections , they not only appealed to football fans but to their gift buying wives , girlfriends and mothers too			1
" i 'm sure @entity42 chose @entity36 because he 's a very attractive , fit fellow , " @entity124 , @entity126 based senior writer for @entity124 , told @entity0			2
" they also chose him because he has appeal in a lot of different places			0
he 's famous in @entity81 , he 's well known in the @entity130 and he 's married to @entity131			0
" he 's got some profile all over the world and they 've got stores all over the world			0
" celebrities are a popular advertising gambit because people are interested in celebrities and like to do what they do			0
" the pioneer of the celebrity underwear market was , however , not a footballer but @entity43 tennis ace @entity145			1
after his sudden retirement from the game in 1983 at the age of just 26 , the 11 - time grand slam singles champion served up another winner by launching his eponymous underwear brand in 1984			1
the company now sells around five million items of underwear across its male and female ranges each year and is stocked in 20 global markets			1
" the @entity145 name is a very strong part of this success , " says the company 's marketing and communications manager @entity160			2
" he 's still involved in that he comes to the office , he 's informed about what we do and he 's still part of the process			0
" @entity145 's dashing good looks , like those of @entity36 , @entity30 and @entity18 , certainly helped him cut a dash in the underwear market but sustaining a successful brand over 30 years relies on more than superficial appeal			1
sports stars arguably make natural underwear manufacturers because they understand more than most about the importance of comfort on the go			2
" if you have the right underwear you feel more confidence on the court or off the court , " explains @entity160			0
" it 's important for sporting performance			0
" at @entity145 we focus on the perfect fit and we are also very fashion conscious			2
we put out underwear that makes people feel more active and attractive			0
" but before you dream about wrapping up a @entity196 thong or a pair of @entity198 for your loved ones , bear in mind it takes a certain type of star to make money from undies			0
" you are talking about one - offs here , " says @entity50			0
" there are probably only a handful of global sports stars that can attempt something like this			2
" for every @entity30 there are thousands and thousands and thousands of footballers who do n't make a thousandth of what he does			2
" @entity218 agrees that true sporting icons stand a better chance of successfully creating a product line that is not directly connected to their core business -- but that even then there could be pit falls .			0
