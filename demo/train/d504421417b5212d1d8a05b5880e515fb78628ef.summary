submitted to the mandatory " virginity test " that the authorities require women -- but not men -- to take as part of the application process			2
in a police hospital in the city of @entity14 in 2008 , @entity4 says that she and 20 other fellow police recruits were told to undress , lie down on a table and allow a physician to perform a " two - finger test			0
" six years later , @entity4 says she is still traumatized			0
" i feared that after they performed the test i would not be a virgin anymore			0
my friend even fainted because ... it really hurt , really hurt			0
" @entity3 's @entity2 have imposed these abusive and degrading tests on thousands of female applicants since as early as 1965 , despite the fact that they contravene national police principles that recruitment must be both " nondiscriminatory " and " humane			1
" meanwhile , the tests have been recognized internationally as a violation of human rights , particularly the prohibition against " cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment " under article 7 of the @entity36 and article 16 of the @entity38 , both of which @entity3 has ratified			1
indeed , last month , the @entity40 stated unambiguously that " there is no place for virginity ( or ' two - finger ' ) testing ; it has no scientific validity			0
" @entity3 's @entity2 ca n't feign ignorance of the tests , nor the opposition to them within police ranks			1
high commissioner @entity50 , a police psychologist who now teaches at the @entity52 of @entity53 in @entity54 , underwent the virginity test in 1984 and subsequently advocated for their abolition			0
those efforts prompted colleagues in police recruitment teams in 2010 to defend " virginity tests " as a means of preventing " prostitutes joining the police			1
" @entity3 's @entity2 has responded to @entity66 's exposure of this abusive practice with defiance			2
a senior police official , inspector @entity69 , on november 18 confirmed that the @entity2 required the test for female applicants			0
but rather than condemning the practice and promising its abolition , @entity69 defended it as a means to ensure the " high moral standards " of the police and reportedly suggested that failure of the test was simply proof that applicants were sex workers			0
" if she [ a candidate ) turns out to be a prostitute , then how could we accept her for the job ? " he said			0
there also are alarming indications that the use of virginity tests extends to other parts of @entity3 's security forces			1
on november 19 , @entity3 's @entity90 , @entity91 , told reporters that such tests have long been obligatory for female military recruits as well			1
sadly , this is n't the first time that @entity3 government officials have advocated such tests for women			2
in august 2013 , @entity99 , education chief of @entity101 district in @entity3 's @entity102 , reportedly sought to impose mandatory " virginity tests " on female high school students to tackle perceived problems of " premarital sex and prostitution			1
" after @entity3 civil society organizations attacked @entity99 's proposal as " against human rights " and then - @entity3 education minister @entity111 , skewered the idea as " degrading and discriminatory , " @entity99 backed off , insisting that he had been misquoted by domestic media			1
but that same month , the semi-official @entity114 in @entity115 urged the local government to impose " virginity tests " as a requirement for all girls entering the city 's high schools			2
" virginity tests " and the @entity3 government 's tolerance of such abusive practices are not an isolated attack on women 's rights			1
instead , they are but one of many far wider - reaching abuses of constitutionally - guaranteed women 's rights that have been occurring across the country in recent years			2
one of the most obvious of those violations is a growing number of discriminatory regulations -- more than 300 -- imposed by local governments since 1999			0
they range from local bylaws requiring women to wear the hijab to a local government 's prohibition against women from dancing			0
the failure of @entity3 's central government in protecting women 's rights is symbolized by the stalled passage of a gender equality bill which has been in draft form since 2009			1
former president @entity152 , who left office in october after a decade in office , deserves a portion of the blame for the erosion of basic rights of women and girls			0
@entity152 is seen by many as having traded political support from the @entity3 @entity163 , @entity3 's top @entity164 clerical body , for a commitment to backing fatwas			2
such government tolerance for abuses of women 's rights must end			0
president @entity169 , who replaced @entity152 in october , has an opportunity to send an unambiguous message in the first weeks of his administration that he will not ignore women 's rights or undermine them for political gain			1
@entity169 can begin by instructing the @entity2 to prohibit " virginity tests " and ordering local governments to abolish local regulations that violate constitutionally - guaranteed women 's rights			1
these moves would send a much - needed message that the government and its security forces are committed to protecting the rights of women , rather than violating them .			2

@entity3 's national police force reportedly requires " virginity tests " for women
