@entity0 -- @entity2 would be a success story in any country			0
originally from @entity6 's impoverished interior , he was the first member of his family to leave his native @entity10 province and is now pursuing an mba at the prestigious @entity12 in @entity0			1
at 24 , @entity2 is the face of new @entity6 : erudite , sophisticated and a card - carrying member of the @entity15			1
" it 's just like applying for university in the @entity19 , " he said of the party			2
" you give an application letter and submit some reports that test your knowledge of @entity15 history			2
" in fact the process is a bit more complicated			0
unlike applying to college , a successful application for membership in the @entity15 typically takes years			1
arduous " observational periods " are required when prospective members are expected to read the classics of @entity33 , become steeped in the party ideology and submit an unending series of essays that are little more than long paeans to the party 's greatness			2
though @entity2 admits few take this process seriously			0
" there are lots of things to download from the @entity47 , we just copy and paste , " he chuckled			0
far more serious is the question of @entity6 's future , a future that -- for better or worse -- will likely be dominated by the @entity15 and eventually people like @entity2			1
in @entity6 today , the party has become an exclusive club for the country 's elite			1
according to the parties own internal statistics , less than 90,000,000 people , or around 7 % of @entity6 's population , currently form its ranks			1
the general view of @entity6 these days is that recruitment is most heavy among university students and the moneyed population , while most of the worker / peasants that constituted the party 's historical support appear no longer welcome			1
it is an irony not lost on @entity72			0
" when they say , ' i care about @entity6 , ' my first instinct is not to believe them			2
" @entity72 , a 25 - year - old @entity77 student at @entity78 in @entity0 is not in the party , a fact he noted with more than a sparkle of pride			0
he claimed that far from fulfilling the party 's original mission of lifting up the poor , the modern party has mutated into an oligarchy , and its youngest members are motivated by nothing more than naked careerism			2
" for lots of jobs , membership in the party is necessary , " said @entity72			1
" my relatives wanted me to join , they knew it would be good for my career , but i do not believe in @entity97 , and i just did n't want to lie			0
" @entity2 , by contrast , is personally unapologetic			0
" 90 % of my motivation was career , " he admitted			2
a number of other students conceded that while career did play a major role in their decision , social responsibility was also a critical element of the party and influenced their desire to join			2
" party members are expected to be better , " chimed one earnestly			0
" it 's probably a combination of things , " said @entity112 , a lecturer at @entity12 's @entity113			0
@entity112 , who has seen a lot of eager @entity118 come and go over the years , noted @entity6 's long history of scholar - bureaucrats and the traditional respect and job security that came with government service			1
today , however , he stressed that young @entity6 had no single motive for joining the party			1
" some students want it for idealistic reasons , there are people who want it for a stable job , people who want it for connections and then there are people who join because their mothers told them to , " he said			0
the party loomed large for their parents , most of who were born during the @entity140 and came of age amidst the tumult of the @entity144 crackdown			0
for them the party today is a safe refuge for their children against the economic uncertainties that plague a developing nation			0
membership in the party is almost never explicitly required for any job and open discrimination is forbidden under @entity6 law , however , for those that want an interview after graduation , the facts on the ground are indisputable			1
party membership is almost always a must for any form of government service and is strongly preferred for employment in @entity6 's vast state - owned enterprises			1
according to the @entity166 , the country graduated 6.8 million students in 2012 , thus ensuring that competition for jobs will be fierce			2
despite @entity6 's impressive market reforms , their 2012 statistical yearbook calculated that state enterprises employ 67.04 million people , which accounts for 30 % of all @entity6 economic activity			1
this amounts to a major institutional disadvantage for @entity6 's non-party citizens			1
a young employee at @entity179 ( @entity179 ) , who is not in the party and requested anonymity , admitted he was the exception that proved the rule			2
he noted that promotion for him would be almost impossible without becoming a party member			0
it is still too soon to say what these rising @entity118 will do with the @entity6 they inherit			0
the party 's @entity190 aversion to youthful leadership ensures that several decades will pass before any of them approach the reins of power -- which might be a good thing			0
the young @entity118 i spoke too generally struggled with any ideas for how to improve the country or the party			1
several suggested " reform " only to be unable ( or unwilling ) to provide any specific examples			0
what is certain is that as the 21st century seems increasingly @entity205 , @entity6 's future leaders will leave their mark not just on their own country , but the world .			1

@entity6 's @entity15 has become an exclusive club for the country 's elite
around 7 % of @entity6 's population currently form its ranks , the party says
many young @entity6 graduates see party membership as useful for their career
discrimination *illegal* under @entity6 law , but membership is needed for government jobs
