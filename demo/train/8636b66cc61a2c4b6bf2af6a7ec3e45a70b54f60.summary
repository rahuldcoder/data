-- @entity1 is a sad occasion for many , but not all of the 15 million @entity4 stepmothers who have stepchildren under the age of 18			1
as it approaches , i am reminded how disappointed and hurt i used to be when my stepdaughter did n't acknowledge me on this day			0
from the time i married my husband when my stepdaughter was only 4 years old , i always felt she viewed me as his wife rather than as a stepmother			1
this distinction may be acceptable to women who marry men with older children , but it bothered me because for years i spent every other weekend playing with her , cooking for her , and doing every other activity of a maternal caregiver			0
i really tried to develop a close relationship with but never felt i succeeded			1
being ignored is minor compared to the hostility and emotional abuse many other stepmothers experience , but my sense of failure grew each time i tried to grow closer to my stepdaughter and was rebuffed			1
my husband inadvertently compounded my discomfort each @entity1 by asking me what kind of gift i wanted			1
his gesture of kindness felt like he was offering me a present for failing a class , which increased my feelings of shame rather than joy			1
also , i hate pretense , and i felt that he was pressuring me to accept his view of our happy family unit			2
he was unwilling to acknowledge my perception that my relationship with my stepdaughter was friendly yet superficial , and just not as intimate as i expected it to be given the time we spent together			0
i felt he valued his feelings more than mine , and i became angry that my feelings were n't given equal standing to his			2
being wished a @entity1 by my parents and friends also felt bad			1
how could i sincerely accept their considerate remarks when my stepdaughter did n't recognize or appreciate my efforts in this capacity ? i felt fraudulent as a stepmother			2
thankfully , my feelings have changed and , now i am in a better place where i accept and understand why my stepdaughter will not reach out to me on @entity1			1
i just wish other stepmothers would n't have to go through similar or far worse emotional distress			2
if stepmothers were n't so unhappy , the divorce rate for second marriages , as high as 60 % to 75 % , might be reduced			1
let me share my journey with you			0
when i first became a stepmother , i was surprised to find it to be so difficult because my stepdaughter has always been well - behaved , smart and respectful			0
no matter how hard i tried to get close to her , i felt like a distant relative			1
i wondered if my experience was unique or similar to other stepmothers so i started a website ( stepsforstepmothers.com ) which featured an online chat room and a questionnaire for stepmothers to fill out			1
almost instantaneously , a vibrant community of stepmothers formed that gave each other encouragement and advice during difficult times			2
in less than two years from the inception of the website , more than 3,000 women answered my questionnaire sharing the challenges they faced			0
at the same time , i also began a monthly stepmother support group comprised of a handful of women who could fit into my small office			0
from these three venues , i gained a lot of information about the specific problems stepmothers encounter			2
more important , i received the necessary support from women sharing similar experiences			0
this helped me overcome my feelings of inadequacy and isolation			0
being understood by others is so important			0
without a doubt , knowing that i was n't alone , that there were other stepmothers struggling to find their rightful place in their new families just like me , was the best medicine to heal my pain			2
while these women could n't ( and should n't ) have solved my specific problems , they validated my feelings			0
while my family and friends cared that i was unhappy , they did n't truly understand what was bothering me			0
these other stepmothers intuitively knew how i felt , and this made me feel much better even though my situation did not actually change			1
these women also helped me understand that my desire to be acknowledged by my stepdaughter on @entity1 was not unreasonable , but it might be too much for her to give me			1
they helped me understand the dilemma that many stepchildren face on @entity1			1
their loyalties may lie with their mother , and they believe she will be offended if they acknowledge their stepmother			0
i respect my stepdaughter 's love for her mother , and never want her to feel any loyalty binds			2
so , i worked on developing a thicker skin to shield myself from being hurt			0
after doing some research , i also learned that only 20 % of stepchildren feel close to their stepmothers			1
as much as i want a close , loving relationship with my stepdaughter or anyone else for that matter , i realized i ca n't force anyone to love or even like me			1
my stepdaughter is entitled to select the people she wants in her intimate circle of family and friends			0
what i can do is appreciate those people in my life who want to be close to me and nurture these relationships			2
by shifting my focus to the positives rather than the negatives in my life , i am now more content			0
while my husband used to encourage my stepdaughter to wish me a @entity1 , she is an adult , and he ca n't control her actions			1
both he and i worked hard to accept the fact that most stepfamilies are not perfect , and ours may never be			2
" it is what it is , " and accepting this reality relieved a lot of wear and tear on my brain as well as his			0
i used to believe that i must always persevere until my goals were accomplished even if they were insurmountable			0
what a relief to know that i can be happy even if every aspect of my life is n't perfect			0
this year i am looking forward to celebrating @entity1 with my mother and will try to make it as special for her as possible			1
i have learned that when i focus my energy on her , i feel good			2
this works for a lot of other stepmothers who choose to spend the holiday with their mothers or with women for whom they deeply care			0
many also treat themselves to a massage , lunch with friends or flowers on this day			0
by choosing to do positive activities on @entity1 , we take responsibility for our happiness			1
i hope my experiences can help other stepmothers have a more enjoyable @entity1 .			1

@entity1 can be a struggle for stepmothers and their stepchildren
