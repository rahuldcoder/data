@entity0 -- the nation 's first black president could be in danger of becoming a " one - termer " if he ca n't convince enough white voters that he deserves another four years in the @entity6			1
for weeks , he 's hovered around 40 % of white voter support - a level that @entity10 presidential candidates have struggled with in the recent past and one that analysts believe @entity13 must maintain in order to win			1
at the same time , he has to encourage minority voters to go to the polls and capture 80 % of their support			1
do the math : @entity1 racial bloc voting calculator " @entity13 in 08 became the first presidential candidate ever to lose whites by double digits and win			1
and he could lose them by even more this time and still win			2
but he ca n't fall through the floor with them , and the polling shows him ... right at the water line of 40 percent that he 'll need , maybe just below sometimes just above , " said @entity25 , the @entity26 editorial director and @entity1 senior political analyst			1
" the big qualification : he 's running better among working class whites in the upper @entity35 battlegrounds of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 than anywhere else and that is his last line of defense in this very close election , " he said			0
with 59 % support among whites , @entity45 presidential nominee @entity44 is hitting record numbers among that group			1
he is approaching a margin of support last seen by @entity45 @entity52 in his 1984 re-election			0
yet , support for @entity44 among non-white voters has hovered between 18 - 20 % , according to national @entity56 tracking poll data			1
during his 2008 presidential campaign , @entity58 nominee @entity58 got roughly 55 % of the white vote and 20 % of the non-white vote			1
" this is a long - term demographic problem , " @entity62 , a @entity1 contributor , said			0
" we do n't want to see our politics divided by race going into the future			0
that is not healthy or sustainable for a nation as large and diverse as we are and this election is shaping up along these fault lines			0
" the racial trends in this year 's election are part of a complicated calculus in which a greater number of white @entity45 voters could offset possibly lower turnout among the @entity10 base of minorities and young voters			1
moreover , an ongoing fight in battleground states over voter identification laws , which some opponents say are efforts to disenfranchise minority voters in a close election and proponents say are needed to prevent fraud , is also a factor			1
the result is a deeply partisan and polarized election that could hinge — in part — on some uncomfortable racial math. " part of the reason we 're thinking about this is the dynamic of this being a black president , " said @entity96 , a cultural and black studies professor at @entity97			0
is @entity13 taking black vote for granted ? neither the @entity13 and @entity44 campaigns commented on the racial differences in the polling figures			1
however , both campaigns have shown that they are aware that the nuances of race factor into potential wins			0
@entity44 's comments during a may fundraiser that " it would be helpful to be @entity114 " because were he " born of @entity116 parents , i 'd have a better shot of winning this , " went over poorly with some @entity120 — a voting block the campaign is trying to make inroads with through @entity125 language advertisements and dispatching bilingual surrogates			0
during recent comments to the @entity129 editorial board , @entity13 said : " i will just be very blunt			2
should i win a second term , a big reason i will win a second term is because the @entity45 nominee and the @entity45 have so alienated the fastest - growing demographic group in the country , the @entity114 community			0
" @entity13 made history when he won the 2008 presidential election — a feat he accomplished in part with 43 % of the white vote			1
it was the same percentage former president @entity143 netted in 1996			0
but @entity10 have struggled for the past decade to hold on to white voters during presidential elections , @entity25 said			1
in 2004 , sen. @entity146 lost his presidential run after getting only 41 % of that group			2
in the 2000 election , vice president @entity149 lost with 42 % of the white vote , 90 % of the black vote and 35 % of the @entity114 vote			1
" democrats have struggled for several decades to maintain any measurable level of support among whites , especially non-college whites , " @entity25 said			0
" no @entity10 nominee has won a majority of whites since 1964			2
and it 's been especially hard for @entity10 to hold onto whites after they have had unified control of @entity0 , which suggests they are having trouble convincing whites to buy into their vision of activist government			1
" and @entity45 have struggled to woo minority voters			2
in 2004 , for example president @entity169 won re-election with 30 % of the minority male and 24 % of the minority female vote			1
exit polls from the 2000 election showed that @entity169 received only 9 % of the black vote and 35 percent of the @entity114 vote			2
the number of minority voters has increased since those elections			2
over the next several generations , the wave of minority voters -- who , according to @entity184 @entity183 figures , now represent more than half of the nation 's population born in the past year -- will become more of a power base in such @entity45 strongholds as @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194			2
that hold will extend all the way to @entity198 , experts say			2
@entity45 problem : ' their voters are white , aging and dying off ' but for now , the population remains majority white and turnout rates are traditionally lower among minorities — both factors that could prove problematic for @entity13			1
" what we 're beginning to see is the @entity45 are becoming increasingly white and democrats are increasingly losing white people			0
they 're maintaining the minorities , but losing whites ... , " @entity1 contributor @entity210 told the network			0
" it 's the message			0
something they 're doing as a party that is not appealing to the white voter			2
and so it is n't just about president @entity13			1
it 's about the platform			0
" @entity210 : both parties have a huge race problem political experts attribute part of @entity13 's struggles with some white voters to disappointment in his handling of the economy			1
discomfort over his shift on such social issues as support for gays serving openly in the military and his administration 's federal mandate requiring religious institutions to offer employees insurance coverage for contraception may keep some socially conservative white voters from casting ballots for @entity13 , political experts say			1
but for some voters , a subtle form of racism may also be at play , @entity96 said			0
" if we were in a post-race society , the measurement is not the election of @entity13 but the re-election of president @entity13			1
he still had to perform and he has been held on a short leash in that context , " @entity96 said making the analogy that black professional sports coaches and managers are similarly given less room to stumble than their white counterparts			0
" many voters including black voters do n't feel @entity13 performed exceptionally ( on the economy ) , " @entity96 said			1
" so much of what we 've seen in terms of @entity44 support is a fundamental distrust of @entity13 because he 's not giving the goods			2
that argument is easier to be made because he 's black			0
... it 's not so much they are voting for @entity44 because he 's white but the economy protects them			2
they do n't have to feel guilty because of the economy			0
the economy lets them off the hook			0
" whatever the reasons for the gap , @entity13 will have to work overtime to maintain numbers of white voters who say they will vote for him while convincing minority voters to turn out to vote , said @entity286 , an associate professor of political science at @entity288			1
" to be more comfortable he should be going above 40 percent ( with white voters ) , " @entity286 said			1
" he 's focusing on women , the majority of whom are going to be white , by talking about issues of reproductive health and contraception			0
he 's going for the white youth vote by talking about student loans			2
" both campaigns realize that all of their careful math hinges on getting out the vote			0
" they should have a good sense of where their voters are and who their voters are			0
they should have spoken to them by phone , " @entity286 said			0
" and they should have a plan in place to ask them to vote between now and @entity314			0

40 % of white voters say they 'll vote for president @entity13 -- the minimum *threshold* he needs to win
for at least a decade , @entity10 have had lower numbers with white voters in presidential elections
political experts attribute lower white support to party identification trends , economy , social policy , race
@entity13 must hold the line with white voters ; get high minority turnout to win .
