no injuries were reported in the five - minute incident			0

after the shots were fired , " the helicopters returned fire and flew back			1
" the @entity1 statement did not mention exchanging fire with ground troops and did not identify the shots as flares , as @entity27 did in @entity72 in an appearance with @entity4 secretary of state @entity74			1
" they are flares , " he said in response to a question asking why the @entity1 military was firing on @entity19 helicopters			2
" just to make sure that they know they crossed the border line			0
" asked if such warnings will continue , he replied , " sometimes the border is so mixed that they do n't realize that they crossed the border			0

" " at no time did @entity23 helicopters cross into @entity1 airspace			0
" the @entity23 did not mention ground troops or say whether the helicopters returned fire			1
both the @entity23 and @entity1 military said they are working to resolve the issue			1
last week , @entity27 said @entity1 would not allow foreign nations to violate its sovereignty to pursue terrorists			0
" we will not tolerate the violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity by any power in the name of combating terrorism , " he said in his first speech to @entity117 as president			0
his remark followed a similar declaration from @entity1 's military chief , gen. @entity128 , who said this month that @entity1 's territorial integrity " will be defended at all cost , and no external force is allowed to conduct operations			0
" a senior defense official in the @entity92 said the @entity92 is trying to determine the details of thursday 's incident			0
" what we do n't know if this was just a case of trigger - happy members of the @entity140 , " the official said , " or whether in fact the @entity1 military does have orders to fire on our helicopters			2
" " we are confident our helicopters were on the @entity8 side of the border , and we have no report they fired back , " the official added			0
top @entity4 commanders will be talking to the @entity1 military about the incident to determine if there was a misunderstanding and to ensure it does n't happen again , a @entity4 official familiar with details of the incident said			1
the official said this is the first verified incident of @entity4 troops being fired upon by @entity1 forces			1
