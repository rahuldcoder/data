in her 30 - year career as a nurse , @entity0 had seen only two babies with anencephaly , a tragic birth defect in which infants are born missing parts of their brain and skull			1
then in 2012 , while working at a hospital in rural @entity12 , she saw two cases in two months			1
to see that many in such a small hospital seemed bizarre to her			2
@entity16 mentioned the unusual spike to an obstetrician friend working at another hospital 30 miles away			2
that doctor had just seen a case of anencephaly , too			2
that 's it , @entity16 thought to herself			2
she called the @entity26 and made a report			2
@entity16 's phone call spurred epidemiologists into action			0
they went through hospital and doctors ' records in a three - county area and found 23 cases of anencephaly from january 2010 to january 2013			0
such a finding meant a rate of 8.4 cases per 10,000 live births -- four times higher than the national average of 2.1 cases per 10,000 live births			1
but the next part of the investigation has come under fire with accusations that state epidemiologists have n't looked hard enough for the cause of a birth defect that 's always fatal			1
' what are you researching ? ' for months , @entity53 has been expecting a call from the @entity26			0
while pregnant , @entity53 lived in the @entity55 , an agricultural area in south - central @entity12			1
her daughter , @entity56 , was born in september with spina bifida , which , like anencephaly , is a neural tube defect the state is also tracking			1
unlike anencephaly , however , spina bifida is usually not fatal			1
she says she 's incredulous and outraged that state researchers have n't called to ask questions : what did she eat while she was pregnant ? did she spend time near farms that sprayed pesticides ? did she take any herbs or supplements ? how about @entity56 's father ? was he exposed to any toxic chemicals ? but no one has called			1
@entity74 , the state epidemiologist who 's investigating the cluster of birth defects , says it might be upsetting for mothers to get a call with such questions			1
most of the women were pregnant with babies who had anencephaly , and the outcome is always horrible			0
if a woman did n't miscarry , she had to make a decision whether to terminate her pregnancy or go ahead and have a baby sure to die soon after birth			1
@entity74 and her colleagues asked themselves : would a phone call traumatize these women ? " we have to weigh that heavily			0
this is a devastating diagnosis , and we know that for a lot of these women they had to make some hard choices , " @entity74 says			0
" we have to weigh how invasive we want to be with these types of interviews			0
" @entity53 says that attitude is paternalistic and condescending			0
she says she would do anything to help prevent another family from having a baby with a severe birth defect			1
state epidemiologists should have made those phone calls a long time ago , she says , since every day that passes , her memory , and those of other mothers , start to fade about what their habits were during pregnancy			1
" what are you researching if you have n't physically called the families to find out ? " she asks			2
' very bad research ' @entity74 has an answer to @entity53 's question : the state examined the mothers ' medical records , which revealed , among other things , the women 's home addresses			1
by the address , epidemiologists can learn a mother 's water source , whether she lives near an agricultural area and whether she took folic acid early in pregnancy , which helps prevent neural tube defects			2
" ( medical records ) give us a lot of information about all of the known risk factors , " the epidemiologist says			0
the state 's rigorous search of the women 's medical records , along with birth and death certificates , found nothing linking the families who had babies with birth defects			1
that finding does n't surprise dr. @entity151 , who 's done several studies on birth defects			1
@entity151 , vice chair of the epidemiology department at the @entity154 , says medical records are notoriously unreliable : one doctor , for example , might note whether a woman smokes , but another doctor might not			0
" from a research point of view , this is very bad research , " she says			0
she says medical records reveal whether a woman has been prescribed any drugs , or diagnosed with a certain condition , but they do n't contain detailed information about a mother 's diet or possible toxins she might have been exposed to in the environment			0
" the data quality on medical records is so low that it 's not really research , " she says			0
even the state @entity26 admits that medical records are limited , writing in a press release : " medical record reviews might not have captured all information , preventing a cause from being identified			2
" but doing the research the right way , @entity151 says , costs hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of dollars , and state health departments often do n't have those funds			2
' i wish they would take it more seriously ' in a few months , @entity12 's @entity26 plans to report how many babies were born with neural tube defects in 2013 to see if the cluster has continued , @entity74 says , adding that it may interview the mothers at some point in the future			1
" we 're still investigating this , " she says			1
" this is nowhere near finished			0
" in the meantime , she says pregnant women in the area should not be nervous			0
but @entity16 , the nurse who found the original cases of birth defects , is n't so sure			1
" i think it 's very scary			0
i think there 's absolutely something going on that needs to be investigated more thoroughly , " she says			0
" i wish they would take it more seriously			0

birth defects in three counties are four times more than national average
one of those children in @entity12 is @entity212 , born with spina bifida
state investigators say they 're still investigating the cluster of birth defects
some question whether they *'ve* done enough to find a cause
