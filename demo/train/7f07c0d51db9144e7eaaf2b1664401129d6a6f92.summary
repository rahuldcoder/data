-- filmmaker @entity1 may be about to set out on the first solo dive to the @entity3 , the deepest known point of the world 's oceans , but sojourns to the darkest recesses of the sea are far from the sole preserve of intrepid would - be record breakers			2
for wealthy enthusiasts with a passion for underwater endeavors , delving into the deepest and most mysterious ocean basins is a niche but accessible form of adventure tourism			1
several companies around the world offer midrange dives of between 1,500 and 3,000 feet , but only specialist tour operator @entity21 takes paying customers to depths of 10,000 feet and beyond			2
the @entity25 - based company has been running trips since the late 1990s that can cost between $ 30,000 and $ 350,000 , depending on the location			0
filmmaker @entity1 to visit deepest ocean depths with the help of @entity30 , a retired @entity31 captain , honorary director of the @entity32 and deep ocean pilot with more than 30 years experience , @entity0 takes a look at the most exciting deep ocean adventures on offer to paying tourists			1
the @entity39 the most famous cruise liner ever built now rests 12,500 feet below the surface of the @entity42			2
tourists have been able to visit the ship 's ghostly grave on @entity48 @entity47 submersibles leased by @entity21 since the early 1990 's , although the trips have been intermittent and will cease after the 100th anniversary of the vessel 's sinking next month			2
voyages cost in the region of $ 30,000 when the tours began , but those partaking in the eight - hour dive have to part with a sum closer to $ 60,000 these days			0
for titanic enthusiasts , however , witnessing the mythical vessel in its final resting place is a priceless if slightly morbid experience , says @entity61 , who has piloted several expeditions			2
" it is a very eerie site , " he says			0
" when you see people 's personal belongings like suitcases and jewelery , it really makes you realize the sheer scale of the human tragedy			0
" the @entity75 another behemoth of the sea to meet its end in the @entity42 was the @entity81 @entity80 vessel @entity75			1
the battle cruiser went down during its first offensive mission at sea in 1941 -- the @entity85 claimed to have sunk it , but the @entity81 countered that the ship was scuttled to prevent it falling into enemy hands -- and now rests 15,000 feet below the surface			0
@entity92 treasure hunters mysterious deep sea find only a handful of people , including @entity61 , have glimpsed @entity75 since its demise , but @entity21 is planning a trip to the wreck site this year			1
" my experiences of visiting @entity75 are vastly different from the @entity39 , " @entity30 said			1
" the ship is remarkably well preserved , and my first impressions were not of tragedy but of a menacing enemy ship			0
" " it 's not until you see the boots of the @entity81 sailors scattered around the place that you get a real sense of history and realize the number of men who perished , " he added			0
the @entity114 situated roughly 300 miles from the @entity118 , @entity115 , the hydrothermal vents of the @entity117 are a towering chimney - like formation of rocks that bellow out a volcanic black mist at depths of nearly 10,000 feet			0
all manner of strange and unaccounted for life forms have evolved in this fascinating environment hidden away from human eyes for millennia , @entity30 said			2
" we know so little scientifically about life at these depths that some of the species that live down there are hard for us to fathom , " he adds			0
@entity21 offers trips to this alien landscape that , like dives to the @entity39 and @entity75 , are expensive and infrequent -- although a @entity47 submersible voyage to the hydrothermal vents is scheduled for mid- 2012			1
@entity139 for those able to afford such a daring mission , a mesmerizing ecosystem where the conditions for life are like no other place on @entity146 awaits discovery , @entity61 says			0
the @entity149 depths and beyond although there are currently only a handful of sites where tourists can pay to delve into the darkest ocean abysses , @entity61 believes that deep sea tourism has the potential to become a major industry in years to come			1
with science budgets being cut in many countries , taking wealthy tourists on voyages to the deepest recesses of the oceans could be a great way to fund important research explorations , he says			1
the deep basins of the @entity149 , which have been cut off from the world 's oceans for 2 million years , are some of the most interesting deep sea dives that have yet to be accomplished , @entity30 explained			1
with the advances in submersible vehicle technology -- such as the advent of the @entity174 and @entity175 , which can reach depths of 15,000 feet and offer increased underwater maneuverability -- all that 's missing is the political and financial will to fulfill such missions , @entity61 says			0
by opening deep sea adventures up to private tourists , he adds , science and human exploration could benefit greatly .			1

wealthy tourists can voyage to the bottom of the sea with specialist tourist companies
expeditions visit the wreck sites of historic vessels such as the @entity39 and @entity75
deep sea tourism could take off soon , says marine specialist capt. @entity30
