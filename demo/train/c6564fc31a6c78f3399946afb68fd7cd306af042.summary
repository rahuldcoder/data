excellent ! @entity0 , who played @entity1 in 1989 's " @entity1 " and 1991 's " @entity2 , " said plans for the pair 's third movie are coming along -- and @entity6 , who played @entity7 , is also on board			1
" ( @entity10 ) will be 40 - something , and it 's all about @entity10 grown up , or not grown up , " @entity0 told @entity9			1
" it 's really sweet and really f * * * ing funny			2
" the @entity13 and @entity6 as two slacker friends who find out that they 're key to a utopian future -- but first they have to pass a history test			1
in the first film , thanks to the intercession of @entity20 ( @entity21 ) , the two travel through history and gather notables such as @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 , allowing them to breeze through			2
in the second film , the two face off against @entity32 -- though , instead of playing him in a " @entity30 " - type chess match , the two choose to challenge death to games of @entity36			2
the first film was an unlikely success , @entity0 recalled in april			1
" i hate to say it , but we kind of gave up on the movie , " @entity0 told the @entity39 's @entity38			1
" it was much closer to the chopping block than anyone knows			0
" winter did n't say who would take the place of @entity21 , who died in 2008 , but told @entity9 there will be " many versions of ourselves in this movie			1
" the bigger challenge , he added , was that the earlier films have such a large fan base and expectations are high			0
" the thing we had going against us is that word got out , " he explains			0
" that was kind of a bummer			0
it just takes a long time to put a movie together			2
now we 're having to build this thing in public , which is fine			0
i just feel bad ( the fans ) have to get dragged through this long , boring , protracted process			0
" winter is currently featured in the film " @entity71			0

@entity0 says a third " @entity1 " movie is still in the works
@entity0 and @entity6 will *reprise* their roles
the characters are slacker *metalheads* who *create* an amazing future
