the bragging war between two of the world 's busiest airports just got more intense			1
for the first time in a decade , @entity6 's @entity5 topped @entity9 's @entity8 in total flights by more than 13,000 , according to new stats from the @entity12			1
the score for 2014 : @entity6 , 881,933 ; @entity8 , 868,359			2
hey , this is important			0
it 's about who 's no. 1			1
it 's about bragging rights			0
" @entity6 reclaims its place " as the " world 's busiest airport , " @entity6 mayor @entity19 said in a statement thursday , crediting new airline routes , newly relocated businesses and the city 's strong economy			1
but @entity8 's @entity8 remains no. 1 in annual passenger traffic			1
spokesman @entity30 said the airport is projected to top 96 million passengers for 2014 , compared with @entity5 , which handled 66.7 million in 2013			1
that put @entity5 in fifth place globally for passengers			2
" with our friends in @entity6 , it 's always a little bit of friendly rivalry , " @entity30 said			2
" our operations folks are probably getting ribbed by their operations folks for edging us out			0
but you know , we 're all one aviation system , so when @entity5 does well , other airports -- including ours -- do well			2
" @entity47 : a day in the life of the world 's busiest airport so really , which airport is the busiest ? which is more challenging for an airport ? handling more airplanes -- or more passengers ? each has its own contributing factors : - @entity5 has eight runways			1
- @entity8 tends to have more sunshine than @entity6 , which may cut weather delays and cancellations			2
- @entity5 hosts many regional airlines , but @entity30 said @entity8 carriers are adding more airliners with higher passenger capacity			2
" so when you have that , of course that means you do n't have as many takeoffs and landings , " @entity30 said			0
let 's stop for a minute and remind ourselves that these two airports are called upon to perform something that 's really quite amazing			0
with incredible attention to safety , they serve nearly a million flights a year and tens of millions of passengers			0
large international airports are among the world 's most complicated facilities , with constantly moving components that require detailed attention			1
being the busiest -- on any level -- is a true badge of honor			0
@entity19 said the victory comes from @entity6 being " the top metro area for foreign direct investment " and its " record growth in international tourism			0
" so , how do you define the world 's " busiest " airport ? what 's the definition of " busy ? " @entity99 's makes it pretty simple : " actively doing something			1
" from a traveling consumer perspective , traditionally , passenger traffic has been the key stat when talking about the " busiest " airports			0
that 's because the @entity12 takeoff and landing stats include military and other noncommercial flights			1
for example , an airport that includes a hub for a cargo delivery outfit -- such as @entity114 in @entity115 , @entity116 -- is going to have more takeoffs and landings that do n't include passengers			1
although 2014 global stats are pending , year - to - date figures suggest that @entity8 will still be the busiest airport in the world based on passenger traffic , according to @entity125			1
in 2013 , @entity125 said @entity126 ranked no. 2 in passengers , with 83.7 million			0
@entity130 's @entity129 ranked no. 3 in 2013 , but @entity125 says @entity131 is poised to surpass @entity129 in international passengers in 2014			2
the rising passenger traffic at @entity131 's airport shows how aviation 's " nucleus " has moved eastward in the past decade , resulting in double - digit growth rates , said dr. @entity138 , @entity125 economics director			0
airlines , he said , are scheduling more fights out of @entity131 that use wide - body , long - haul planes that carry more passengers			0
as for airport takeoffs and landings in 2013 , it ranks globally like this ( after @entity8 and @entity6 ) : 3			1
@entity126 ; 567,759 meanwhile , these new numbers appear to be throwing more fuel on the fire in the rivalry between @entity155 and @entity5			1
" we 'll let them hold the mantle this year , " said @entity30			0
" we 'll come back swinging next year , and we 'll see what happens			0

@entity6 declares @entity5 " world 's busiest airport "
@entity12 stats show @entity5 tops @entity155 as no. 1 in takeoffs and landings
does that make @entity5 the " world 's busiest airport ? " depends on whom you ask
@entity155 handles more yearly passengers than any other airport , worldwide
