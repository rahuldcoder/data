@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the " @entity5 " charter boat leaves the dock and heads into @entity8 , it is chock full of divers			1
but there 's not a single paying client aboard			2
the boat is carrying a team of local dive industry professionals -- along with an underwater cameraman -- who arranged wednesday 's trip to show that the @entity18 oil spill has not affected the prized dive site , the @entity20			1
" we 're going to go out look at the ship , assess the marine life on it and find that there 's no oil anywhere around , " said @entity21 , who owns a dive shop in the area			1
aside from its beautiful white sand beaches , @entity0 is home to the only aircraft carrier that has been turned into an artificial reef			1
divers travel from all over the world to see the @entity20 not just because it 's the world 's largest manmade reef			1
the " @entity20 " as it is sometimes called is also an important piece of history			0
" it has a long history in the @entity42 [ and ] it was also the last piece of @entity44 soil that [ @entity48 ] @entity49 saw before he was shot down , " said @entity45 , the owner and captain of @entity47			1
@entity49 's aircraft flew off of the @entity20 in 1967 before it was shot down during a bombing mission over @entity52 , @entity53			2
@entity49 was held as a prisoner of war until 1973			0
a year before @entity49 's mission , the @entity20 suffered an onboard fire that killed 44 sailors -- one of the worst fires to engulf a ship since @entity61 in 2006 , the ship was purposely sunk in an upright position to create the reef , which has attracted nearly 40 different species of fish			1
the $ 20 million project was intended not only to serve as a habitat for marine life , but also to boost tourism in the @entity0 region			1
now , the historical dive site is threatened by the leaking oil rig more than 100 miles away that continues to spew an estimated 210,000 gallons ( 5,000 barrels ) of crude into the @entity18 every day			1
@entity21 said he 's been assuring his customers that , as of now , there is no need to cancel their scheduled dive trips to the @entity20 , which is about an hour - long boat ride from the shore			2
" the marine life in our area i 'll put it up against anywhere in the world as far as the quantity and quality and variety , " says @entity21			2
as of wednesday afternoon , the oil spill was stretched from the northeast side of the @entity93 to about 60 miles off @entity0 , @entity1 , according to @entity94 of the @entity95			1
@entity21 said some of his clients have cancelled their dive trips , but most people are just calling and asking about the water conditions			0
so the @entity0 team plans to post video of wednesday 's dive on the @entity104 to show people that the oil spill has not impacted this @entity107 community			1
no oil was expected to impact the shores of @entity0 beach and beyond through the weekend , @entity109 's disaster response team said thursday			1
wednesday was a perfect day for filming an underwater dive			0
the @entity18 looked like a lake , the sun was bright and marine life could be seen as the boat made its way to the dive site			0
sea turtles were sunning themselves on the water 's surface			0
a few dolphins jumped in and out of the water			0
in the air , the @entity127 's @entity126 team flew across the clear blue sky			0
as the boat anchored at the @entity20 site , hammock calmly waited for the news from the divers			0
he had calculated that the oil was still about 90 miles away			2
share your stories from after the oil spill about a half hour after entering the water , the divers emerged			1
" how was it ? " @entity45 asked			2
they all had similar answers			0
the divers say the marine life looked amazing			0
there were all types of tropical fish on the wreck , as well as the resident octopus , a lot of barracudas , and a sea turtle			0
even better news : there were no signs of oil			0
@entity45 is encouraged by the news , but repeated the words of so many business owners on the @entity107			2
" this oil will be devastating to us , " he said			0
" if this oil shows up here it will definitely shut down a big industry in the panhandle			1
