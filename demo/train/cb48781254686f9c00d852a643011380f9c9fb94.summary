@entity0 , @entity1 -- lapped by the pristine waters of the @entity6 , the @entity1 coastal city of @entity4 attracts millions of sun - seeking tourists each year , beguiling them with its sweeping scenery , picture - perfect beaches and blazing sunshine			1
it is this abundance of sunlight -- @entity1 receives greater annual solar radiation energy than @entity15 and @entity16 according to estimates by the @entity18 of the @entity19 -- that has prompted @entity4 's local authorities to push ahead with plans to harness the city 's solar potential			1
" we aim to make @entity4 the leader of solar power generation of @entity1 and to promote it to the world as ' the @entity31 , ' " says @entity4 's mayor @entity25			1
the declaration comes as the sun - soaked city , located some 700 kilometers south of @entity35 , starts rolling out its ambitious plans to use solar power to generate electricity , emulating the successful example of cities like @entity41 , @entity15 , which has put in place regulations requiring solar panels to be fitted to all large new buildings			1
in april , the city opened the " @entity46 , " an ecological research and educational center designed by architectural firm @entity49 to raise awareness about the benefits of renewable energy and promote eco-tourism			0
the zero - emission structure , which was built with ecological materials , generates most of its energy using photovoltaic panels ( @entity58 in total ) as well as a windmill and heat pumps			0
' living ' buildings could inhale city carbon emissions these systems are supplemented with gray - water recycling -- re-use of used water from bathtubs , showers and so on			2
-- and passive solar heating features such as a greenhouse to collect heat during the winter months			0
it also has a green roof that facilitates rainwater harvesting and acts as heat insulation			0
" the building is also very significant because it is @entity1 's first energy positive building , " says architect @entity77 , the designer behind the @entity46			1
" it actually produces more energy than it consumes			0
" the architect says the structure has fascinated the local population while helping to change perceptions that buildings can only be big energy consumers			0
" the idea that having a building that not only provides its own energy but actually gives some back is a totally new phenomenon for @entity1 people , " says @entity77 , who is also a professor at @entity35 's @entity87			2
" they like it , they find it very intriguing			0
" local authorities expect around a thousand people to visit @entity46 each month , including students , green investors and hotel owners			0
they say the project is just the first part of a long - term initiative to turn @entity4 into a climate - friendly city -- other initiatives include a waste management facility that will convert the city 's sewage into biogas			1
" @entity4 has already been the pioneering city of green energy ( in @entity1 ) , " says @entity25			1
" we are trying to make @entity4 the leader of agriculture , tourism , park and garden lighting , energy generating and ( solar ) panel producing			2
" while educating the local population about achieving energy efficiency , @entity77 says the technology used in the @entity46 can also help @entity4 -- @entity1 's biggest coastal resort and home to several five - star hotels -- to become an ideal destination for eco-conscious tourists			1
" there are several hotels which are considering green energy to attract customers , " he says			0
" a hotel which can say that ... if you 're staying here your carbon footprint is zero for the duration of your stay -- this is becoming very interesting for people worldwide , " he adds			0
for the moment , however , sunny @entity4 is still far from being branded a green resort -- local authorities estimate that eco-visitors account for just 1 % of the city 's tourism			2
mayor @entity25 says that @entity1 is missing a trick by failing to exploit its clean energy capabilities			2
" @entity1 has a very big potential in solar and wind energy			2
unfortunately , the insufficient and wrong policies of the government prevent the promotion of them , " he says			0
@entity1 's geothermal potential despite receiving plenty of sun , @entity1 has been remarkably sluggish in developing a sound solar industry			1
the country still depends heavily on oil and natural gas , most of which is imported from abroad			0
in 2008 , oil provided 37 % of @entity1 's total final consumption of energy , natural gas and electricity 18 % each , coal 17 % , biomass and waste 7 % and other sources 3 % , according to figures by the @entity176			1
at the same time , limited government subsidies , coupled with high costs for green energy equipment , have further impeded the market 's growth , leaving little incentives for households to go solar			2
yet , @entity77 is optimistic that green initiatives like the one in @entity4 can help @entity1 's green energy sector to take off in the coming years			1
he notes that the lack of government incentives has bolstered @entity1 's fledgling renewable energy industry by creating a solid and growing grassroots movement -- that , he says , is in contrast to the top - down approach that was implemented in other @entity193 countries , where the sector grew after governments started offering subsidies and incentives for green energy usage			1
" the way we are going through it in @entity1 is more painful but is also healthier because it is growing out of real demand , " says @entity77 .			0

@entity4 has *launched* a long - term initiative to become a climate - friendly city
@entity1 's tourist *hotspot* wants to use solar power to generate electricity
the country has been slow in developing a sound solar industry
