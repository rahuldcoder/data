that 's how much time it took @entity4 of @entity5 , @entity6 , to type a complex sentence on a @entity8 , which makes her the new @entity10 holder for fastest typing on a phone			1
the sentence for this particular record , as determined by @entity10 , reads as follows : " the razor - toothed piranhas of the genera @entity15 and @entity16 are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world			2
in reality they seldom attack a human			0
" before @entity4 , @entity24 of @entity25 held the record , having typed the above sentence in 35.54 seconds earlier this year			1
interestingly enough , @entity4 claims she 's out of shape as far as texting goes			0
she used to send a lot of text messages to her boyfriend @entity32 -- 40 or 50 per day day , she says -- but after they moved in together she has n't been texting as much			0
but when @entity35 invited her to have a go at breaking the world record , it turned out her fingers were in better shape than she thought ; she texted faster than anyone else and by a large margin			0
the new world record still awaits official approval from @entity10 , but if it turns out to be legitimate , the title of the world 's fastest texter will move from the @entity47 to @entity6			1

@entity51 woman is the new @entity10 holder for fastest typing on a phone
she breaks the old record , held by a @entity25 , @entity59 man , by nine seconds
the new world record still awaits official approval from @entity10
