@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 candidate @entity3 will drop out of the presidential race on monday and endorse front - runner @entity6 , a senior official with the former @entity10 governor 's campaign told @entity2			1
@entity3 finished third in last week 's @entity12 primary , a state in which he had staked his entire campaign , behind @entity6 and @entity17 rep. @entity16			1
" @entity3 did not want to stand in the way of the candidate best prepared to beat @entity20 and turn our economy around			1
that 's @entity6 , " the official said			1
the former governor and @entity27 ambassador to @entity28 made headlines when he decided to take his campaign to compete in the @entity1 primary , where he struggled to build support			1
an @entity35 poll released friday showed @entity3 with just 1 % of likely @entity4 primary voters in the state			0
" @entity3 made a basic calculation here , let 's be honest			1
if you look at the polling , he 's doing miserable in @entity1			2
he 's not going to win the state next saturday and so if he wants to run in 2016 ... this is a chance ... to try to get a little bit of goodwill in the party , a little bit of leverage , " said @entity2 chief national correspondent @entity43			1
despite his low polling numbers , @entity1 's largest newspaper , @entity54 , endorsed @entity3 earlier on sunday			1
the paper 's editorial board stated that while @entity6 is " more appealing " than the rest of the @entity4 field , @entity3 is " more principled , has a far more impressive resume and offers a significantly more important message			1
" the board praised what it called the " essential values that drive his candidacy : honor and old - fashioned decency and pragmatism			0
" @entity68 , the spokesman for candidate @entity69 , said that with @entity3 dropping out , " we are one step closer to a bold @entity73 conservative winning the @entity4 nomination			2
" @entity3 , known as one of the moderate candidates , launched his presidential campaign on june 21			0
meanwhile , conservative @entity4 presidential hopefuls attacked @entity6 on sunday to try to head off what two influential republicans said could be a decisive third straight victory for the former @entity83 governor			2
in appearances on morning talk shows , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 all contrasted their conservative credentials with @entity6 's more moderate record in hopes that @entity1 voters will agree with their contention that @entity6 ca n't defeat @entity20 in november			1
debates on monday in @entity0 and thursday in @entity95 will almost certainly give voters their last chance to see all the remaining @entity4 candidates on one stage , as some are likely to drop out after saturday 's vote			0
@entity2 will broadcast the @entity95 debate			0
the @entity1 has chosen the eventual @entity4 nominee every time since 1980 , and @entity6 's victories this month in the first two contests of the nominating process -- in @entity107 and @entity12 -- were unprecedented by a non-incumbent @entity4 contender			1
two @entity1 @entity4 politicians , sen. @entity110 and rep. @entity111 , said sunday that another @entity6 victory this week would likely sew up the nomination for him			1
" if for some reason he 's not derailed here and @entity6 wins @entity1 , no one 's ever won all three , i think it should be over , " @entity110 told @entity115 's " @entity116 " program			1
" that would be quite a testament to his ability as a candidate and a campaigner			0
" on the same program , @entity111 said : " if @entity6 wins @entity1 , i think the game is over			2
" @entity88 , the @entity17 governor who lags behind after poor performances in earlier debates , kept up his criticism of @entity6 's experience as a venture capitalist -- an attack line shared by @entity86 but criticized by @entity87 and other conservatives			1
after previously describing @entity6 's former company , @entity135 , as corporate " vultures " who looted @entity139 companies , @entity88 used less combative language sunday on @entity2 's " @entity141 " but reiterated his accusation that it " came in and basically shut down " a @entity144 steel mill , taking away " a lot of money in management fees			1
" president @entity20 's campaign will certainly raise the matter , if @entity6 gets the @entity4 nomination , @entity88 noted			1
" the issue 's not going away , " he said			0
" now 's the time to talk about it , not in september and october			0
" @entity86 , the former house speaker , expressed a similar view on @entity115 's " @entity116 " and the @entity156 program " @entity157 , " comparing the primary process to the @entity160 playoffs that eventually produce two hardened teams to compete in the @entity162			0
" our nominee had better be capable of standing up there , telling the truth , enduring the negative ads and winning the vote , " @entity86 said , insisting he is the more accomplished debater and stronger candidate than @entity6			2
on @entity115 , @entity86 also said he would release his tax return on thursday and reiterated his challenge for @entity6 to do the same , continuing a campaign to get @entity6 to disclose details of his personal wealth			0
@entity6 has said he has complied with legal disclosure obligations , but added he might release his tax returns or further information in the future			0
@entity86 said it would be better for @entity6 to release his tax return now instead of having the issue come to a head in the fall amid a one - on - one campaign against @entity20			2
" we 're all going to do everything we can to defeat @entity20 , " @entity86 said , adding that @entity20 's re-election " would lead him to be so arrogant and so aggressive that it 's hard to imagine what would come out of a second term			2
" @entity87 , meanwhile , told " @entity198 " that an endorsement on saturday from @entity194 conservative leaders should help his campaign , as he seeks to regain the luster of a razor - thin second - place finish behind @entity6 in @entity107			0
" i was told that individual members are going to go out and do things with , you know , either endorsements or contacting people here in the state and across the states to support us and to help our cause , " said @entity87 , a former @entity199 senator who was virtually tied for fourth in @entity12 with @entity86			0
the @entity194 conservative endorsement was intended to unite evangelical voters behind one candidate to avoid a split that would hand @entity6 a victory despite @entity1 's conservative pedigree			1
" it would be helpful if everybody dropped out and i would win , " @entity87 said			0
" but , you know , the idea is , we 're going to go through this process , people have the right to go out and make the case to the voters and then we 'll see what happens			0
" @entity111 , who won election in 2010 with strong support from the tea party movement , told @entity115 that the impact of the evangelical vote -- a typically large bloc in @entity1 -- will be " huge " on saturday			0
" it 's hard to find a single candidate that rallies all of the @entity194 voters in @entity1 and therefore that splintered approach will probably have a major impact in the state 's primary , " @entity111 said			2
the @entity35 poll released last week finds @entity6 and @entity86 in a statistical dead heat in the state			0
according to the poll , 29 % of likely @entity4 primary voters say they will support @entity6			0
another 25 % said they would support @entity86 , putting @entity6 's lead within the poll 's sampling error			2
the survey indicates rep. @entity16 of @entity17 has 20 % of the vote , @entity88 has 9 % , @entity87 has 7 % , with 7 % undecided			0
@entity2 's @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 and @entity254 contributed to this report .			1
