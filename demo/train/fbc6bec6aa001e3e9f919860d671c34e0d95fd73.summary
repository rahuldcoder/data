-- though ke $ ha 's first album , @entity4 , was a glitter - coated gutter dance party , with the brash singer getting sleazy and leading throngs of revelers into the night , no guitars were invited			1
on her new full - length album , warrior , rock music scores a place on the guest list : the lp 's first single , " @entity13 , " has a strummed guitar front - and - center			1
the resulting album splits the difference between ke $ ha 's signature brand of hooky rap - pop ( " @entity34 , " " @entity35 " ) and razor - sharp rockers ( " @entity33 , " a collaboration with the @entity26 ' @entity25 and @entity27 ) , with a few strikingly intimate moments ( the piano - tinged " @entity29 , " which features the @entity32 ' @entity31 )			1
@entity0 spoke with ke $ ha while she was promoting warrior in the @entity40 , and she opened up about bringing imperfections into pop music , working with @entity43 and who on her tour has been playing the essential role of " mr. penis			1
" @entity48 : ke $ ha 's @entity49 @entity0 : how did you decide to evolve from @entity4 to cannibal to warrior ? ke $ ha : on this record i wanted to maintain what i believe is who i am -- wild , filthy - mouthed , very honest -- but at the same time , address the changes in my life , and bring the music i listen to offstage together with the music i make			1
for me , that meant working with awesome collaborators			2
there was a strict no - guitar rule on @entity4			2
i just had this vision of making everyone on the planet dance			2
i wanted to be the dance commander			2
on this record , i wanted to bring the music i listened to offstage -- [ @entity43 's ] @entity71 , the slider , electric warrior [ both by @entity75 ] -- into my music , which is pop music			1
now , to some people , pop is a dirty word , or only a " guilty pleasure			1
" but i f * * king love pop music			1
i always have , and i will ' til the day i die , and i want to make pop records			2
but i love bringing [ rock 's ] balls and irreverence to my music as much as i can			2
i once said that i wanted to make " c * * k pop. " and there are moments of that on the record , but there are also the quintessential @entity92 $ ha moments like " @entity94 " -- rap - talking , s * * t - talking -- and there are also moments that are unexpected , stripped - down and just me			1
as far as the people i collaborated with , i just wanted to take all my idols and make a record with them			0
massive beats , @entity101 and @entity102 : ke $ ha rocks out on @entity104 @entity0 : how did you hook up with @entity43 ? what was it like to work with him ? ke $ ha : being in the studio with him was one of the most incredible days of my life -- definitely one of those " holy s * * t ! " moments			1
i 've been obsessed with him forever			0
i remember when my brother brought home his record on vinyl			0
and then i started reading about him , and i was like , " i f * * * ing love him			0
" i just started asking everyone i know , pretty much , if any of them knew @entity43 , and this time it paid off			1
@entity128 to explore ' @entity129 ' @entity0 : this has been a year when rock songs by the likes of fun			0
have crossed over to the pop charts			2
do you see pop music embracing guitars more in 2013 ? ke $ ha : for me , bringing in rock was about making the perfect imperfect			1
when you 're making songs electronically , it 's easy to make them perfect -- you can change things to the microsecond , move the drums down , @entity149 everything			0
i wanted to keep the electronic elements while making things a little bit imperfect , which makes it feel more organic			0
i wanted to capture real moments in time			0
photos : ke $ ha 's @entity155 @entity0 : that reminds me of your collaboration with the @entity160 , which was so chaotic and balls - to - the - wall			1
on the ep that comes with warrior , you cover the country track " @entity166 , " and i kind of see you as a pop outlaw			1
there 's an idea that pop is glossy and perfect , and you 're like , " f * * k it , i 'm gon na do what i want			2
" and as a result you have this really strong connection with your fans			0
ke $ ha : i love my fans			1
and i love that you called me a pop outlaw			2
" @entity166 " was written by my mom [ @entity180 ] , and made famous by @entity181			0
@entity182 also sang that , and @entity184 , and they 've both been famous for being the outlaw , or the misfit			0
@entity0 : are you going to be touring anytime soon , and if you are , are you bringing back the penis suit ? ke $ ha : the penis suit is one of my favorite moments onstage			1
you do n't understand the people who have been in that suit			0
very famous people have worn it			0
my mother has been in that suit , friends , ex-boyfriends , lovers -- you name it , they 've been in that suit			0
i ca n't imagine it going anywhere			0
