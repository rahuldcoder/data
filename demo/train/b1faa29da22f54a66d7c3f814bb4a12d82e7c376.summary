-- @entity1 touched hearts during an impassioned speech to a 200,000 - strong crowd in @entity5 , @entity7 newspapers agreed , but suspicions remain about the @entity11 contender 's motives for courting a @entity13 audience			1
@entity1 addressed a huge and friendly crowd in @entity5 on thursday			1
@entity5 's @entity15 wondered whether so many young people had ever gathered for a political event in @entity7 and said that @entity1 's address -- which echoed speeches by former @entity21 presidents @entity22 and @entity23 when the divided city was in the @entity26 frontline -- could only have been made in the @entity7 capital			1
" @entity1 's address might not have been statesmanlike and it definitely was n't worldly-wise			1
but with its symbolism and the message of this 46 - year - old , it certainly was the signal of a new era for a new generation on both sides of the @entity37 , " the newspaper said			2
" what better thing could have happened to us than the potential next president of the @entity21 sending this message to the world from here ? " @entity1 moved on from @entity7 to @entity43 on friday where he was due to hold talks with president @entity46			1
he is also slated to meet @entity48 prime minister @entity47 and opposition leader @entity49 in @entity50 later friday			0
@entity7 tabloid @entity51 said @entity1 had articulated his version of the @entity53 -- the idea that politics can change the world : " unlike @entity58 , he wants to do this in cooperation with others , especially @entity13			1
that 's his message from @entity5 : let 's try this together ! " but @entity51 warned that an @entity1 presidency would place fresh demands on traditional allies such as @entity7 , which fell out with @entity69 over the war in @entity71 and has refused to contribute combat troops to @entity74 operations in @entity75			1
ireport.com : view photos from the scene " he did n't say what he expects , but it 's not hard to figure it out			0
he 'll call for more @entity7 participation during international crises ; he 'll call for more @entity7 soldiers , " said @entity51			2
but it concluded : " no matter how you might feel about this : a president @entity1 would be @entity7 's friend -- and a fan of @entity5 ! " @entity91 's @entity90 sounded a more cautious note , warning that an @entity1 presidency would be " expensive for @entity7			1
" " he explicitly called for @entity7 soldiers for @entity75 -- he did not say ' more soldiers ' but that was what he meant , " said commentator @entity94			1
" and @entity1 also indicated this : he will want support as president to wind up the @entity71 adventure			2
" the paper noted too that the speech had been intended less for the crowds gathered in @entity5 's @entity107 park than for " hesitant white voters in @entity109 and @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 " and said that @entity1 had proved himself to be a clever tactician , capable of shifting positions to suit his audience			1
" he wants to convince ( voters ) that the world will also listen to a black president ... and there 's one other thing one should n't forget when talking about @entity1 : he easily reworks even positions that have been written in stone and adjusts to new requirements			2
" but nobody in the @entity7 press appears to have been quite as smitten by their visitor as @entity51 reporter @entity128 , who had the opportunity to work out with @entity1 in the gym of the @entity131 earlier in the day			2
" @entity1 ( with toned arms and a strong back ) puts on his headphones for his @entity135 to listen to pop music			2
then he jumps on a fitness bike			0
he pushes three times on the pedals -- but then ca n't be bothered with it			0
" he picks up a pair of 16 kilo weights and starts curling them with his left and right arms , 30 repetitions on each side			0
then , amazingly , he picks up the 32 kilo weights ! very slowly he lifts them , first 10 curls with his right , then 10 with his left			0
quickly i ask : " mr. @entity1 , could i take a photo ? "			0
" of course ! " he answers , before asking my name and coming over to stand next to me			0
" my name 's @entity128 " i reply			0
" i 'm @entity1 , nice to meet you ! " he says , and puts his arm across my shoulder			0
i put my arm around his hip -- wow , he did n't even sweat ! what a man ! "			0

@entity7 papers agree that @entity1 won hearts with @entity5 speech
@entity15 : @entity1 's speech a " signal of a new era for a new generation "
but question marks hang over @entity11 contender 's motives
papers say @entity1 will demand more @entity7 troops for @entity75
