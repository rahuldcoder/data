-- there are promising signs that the @entity3 and the @entity4 might be getting serious about holding for - profit colleges accountable after so many of them have deceived students for years			1
the devious practices of one of the country 's largest for - profit colleges finally caught up with it in june after years of accusations of inflated job placement rates , abysmally low graduation rates , high loan default rates and more when @entity16 reached a deal with the @entity3 to shut down its operations			1
in exchange for $ 16 million in operating funds , @entity24 -- the parent company of @entity19 , @entity19 , @entity20 , and @entity21 -- agreed to sell off or close its more than 100 campuses across the country , while at the same time denying the allegations			0
then , this month , the company announced it had received a grand jury subpoena from the @entity33 attorney 's office in @entity34 , where the for - profit is based and where nearly a fourth of the school 's 107 campuses are located			1
the subpoena , which indicates a possible federal criminal investigation , requests the company turn over documents on its job placement rates , graduation rates , and materials used in marketing and recruitment			1
now , as @entity24 winds down its operations , the @entity3 needs to make sure no student is left struggling after the demise of this institution			0
the 72,000 students trapped on @entity24 's sinking ship are some of our nation 's neediest			2
like many for - profit schools , @entity24 targeted students who are overwhelmingly minority , female and low income			1
they are veterans back from @entity60 and @entity61 -- @entity24 received $ 186 million in post- 9/11 gi bill funds in 2012 -- blue - collar workers seeking to improve their skill sets , and single mothers who hope more education will help them provide for their children			1
over and over again , for - profit colleges like @entity24 have failed these students by promising a quick path to financial stability through vocational education programs			1
but in reality , these schools are notorious for charging exorbitant tuition without preparing students for jobs in the real world			2
on average , tuition at for - profit colleges is four to six times higher than at a comparable public school			1
a two - year @entity83 investigation found a medical assistant diploma cost $ 22,275 at @entity24 's @entity21 in @entity85 , @entity86 , while the same program at @entity88 costs $ 1,650			2
an undergraduate certificate in paralegal studies at the @entity92 campus of @entity93 costs more than $ 43,000			0
at the @entity92 area community college , an associate 's degree in paralegal studies costs less than $ 3,000			0
and students at for - profit colleges generally can not transfer credits because the schools lack the accreditation recognized by traditional community and four - year colleges			1
without a job or the ability to transfer credits , students at for - profit colleges all too often find themselves unable to repay their loans ; for - profit college students represent just 11 % of federal loan borrowers , yet account for nearly 50 % of loan defaulters			1
many of these issues apply to the deal with @entity24 , and students are being left in limbo			2
depending on the accreditation each campus has , @entity24 students may not be able to transfer the credits they 've already earned			2
most unbelievably , the @entity3 continues to allow some @entity24 college locations to enroll studentsâ € ” without meaningfully disclosing that the school is in the process of being sold off			0
the very arm of the government that should be protecting students is aiding the profiteers in a bait and switch			2
@entity24 has a long record as one of the worst players in the for - profit education industry			2
in 2012 , when the @entity3 released the first metrics to determine the success of career college programs , 44 of @entity24 's programs failed outright			0
in fact , @entity16 performed worse than any other for - profit chain			1
but because a lawsuit prevented those metrics from being enforced , @entity24 's practices and programs continued unabated			0
last year , the @entity145 and @entity146 announced investigations of the company 's lending practices			0
earlier this year , the @entity3 asked @entity24 to document its job placement and graduation rates , and when the documentation never arrived , the department delayed the release of financial aid to @entity24 's students			1
despite taking $ 1.4 billion from the federal government in 2012 alone , @entity24 ca n't keep its doors open			0
it is also under investigation for deceptive practices by the attorneys general of @entity86 and @entity163			0
last august , i represented the @entity165 and other low - income legal services providers on a @entity3 committee that proposed regulations to bring greater accountability to the for - profit college industry			1
our committee worked hard to add teeth to the rules that govern for - profit colleges , but industry trade groups began to pressure the @entity3 to water down those standards			1
the collapse of @entity24 makes clear just how important these new regulations are			0
if meaningful regulations had already been in place , it 's quite likely that many of the 72,000 @entity24 students would n't be facing such tremendous uncertainty today			0
while we ca n't fix the past , we can make steps to start protecting students now			0
for those students enrolled at schools that the for - profit is selling , the @entity3 must ensure that the buyer will allow students to complete their degrees			1
it should not allow sale of the company to another failing school offering unmarketable degrees			0
otherwise , the @entity24 problem will not be solved by the shut down -- it will simply be a name change			0
@entity24 and other similar colleges have made a profit for decades off the backs of students			2
as a nation , we must say " enough			0

@entity207 : government is at last making for - profit colleges accountable
@entity211 : @entity16 must shut down after inflated job rates , low graduation rates
@entity211 : for - profit colleges charge *sky* - high tuition without getting students ready for jobs
she says for - profits target and rip off minorities , females , veterans , blue - collar students
