-- on the surface , water polo appears an elegant pursuit played by extremely polished performers			1
but beneath the water line , a different storyline is playing out			2
limbs bash against each other , punches and kicks are thrown , nails are used to claw at an opponent and every so often , a player inadvertently disrobes another			0
the thing is , like most players , @entity18 goal - machine @entity16 would n't want it any other way			1
" we have a running joke that the referees probably only see about 20 % of what really happens , " @entity20 told @entity0 's human to @entity22			1
" i guess what you can get away with is what you can get away with but there 's a lot of pulling , grabbing , bathers get ripped off			2
" anything to get that little advantage over your opponent i guess is a win			0
we do get our nails checked before each game to kind of limit the amount of scratches we can give to our opponents			0
" that 's not to say it does n't happen , and there are a lot of kicks and holds and punches that also do go on under the water			2
" we 're really friendly out of the water but as soon as we get into that pool anything is possible			2
" @entity20 thrives in this school of hard knocks and is the hot shot in front of goal for her national team , known as the @entity57			1
bronze medalists at the @entity60 , they fell narrowly short of gold at the @entity62 in @entity63 , losing 8 - 6 to host nation @entity64 in last weekend 's final			1
the 25 - year - old was top scorer in @entity64 with 16 and was selected in the team of the tournament upon its conclusion			1
she has over 150 caps for her country -- a source of immense pride			2
" i feel free when i play water polo , " @entity20 explains			1
" there 's something in me that just lets go of everything , i forget about everything			2
" i 'm in the moment			0
i love playing for @entity83 and i get excited every time i cap up for @entity83			2
i just love being competitive			0
" i 'm pretty stubborn			0
i do n't even like to lose a game of @entity86 , so winning 's always on the top of my priority list			0
" not only does water polo require finesse , vision , excellent hand - eye coordination and strength , it also requires bundles of stamina			1
players are only allowed to use one hand with which to catch and throw the ball and must tread water for all four quarters of the match -- over half an hour at @entity106 level			1
to do so , they employ a technique that goes by the wonderful name of eggbeating			0
but what it is exactly ? " the eggbeater is , i guess , what your mum does at home when she 's trying to whip some cream up -- we kind of have our legs going , " @entity20 explains			1
" it 's almost like we 're pedaling , but we 're pedaling out wide , so if you imagine you 're pedaling on a bike and then just making sure it 's going out wide			0
" it 's almost like you 're sitting on the toilet			0
you 're beating an egg with your legs			0
" water polo is a game she has grown into			1
the @entity132 native 's own evaluation of her game in the early days is " pretty shocking			0
" but her appetite for the game and determination to improve intensified after the @entity18 women 's team won gold at the @entity140 when the nation was swept away by @entity143 fever			1
by the age of 13 @entity20 was playing for her state , @entity146 , and by 16 she was representing her country , captaining @entity83 to the @entity149 title in 2007			1
yet there is no doubt as to what she regards as the pinnacle of her career to date -- that third - placed finish at @entity60			2
" my proudest moment is 100 % being at the @entity106 and winning a bronze medal , " she said			0
" that 's definitely been the highlight of my career and to do it at the highest level was amazing			0
" the @entity106 is that pinnacle and so just to do it there , in front of a really supportive crowd was just incredible -- i get chills thinking about it now			0
" when in full flow , water polo can be quite a frenetic business , so @entity20 and her teammates have engineered unique ways of communicating during the game			1
" we yell at each other			0
it can be a challenge to hear with the crowd and the water in your ears and we also like to point at each other , " she said			0
" then if that does n't work , we usually just splash each other ! " while obviously disappointed at missing out on gold at the @entity62 , @entity20 was an integral part of her country 's best return since 2007 , when the @entity193 also took silver			1
and she hopes @entity83 's performance can entice more youngsters into the sport that continues to provide her with that enchanting sense of freedom			1
" for the sport of women 's water polo , i hope that it gets more and more exposure , " she added			1
" i truly believe it 's one of the best sports there is to play for men or women and there are such great women 's teams out there			1
" i hope that a lot of females look towards those idols and say , ' i do want to play this sport and i do want to play for my country			2
' " i just hope it gets bigger and bigger and hopefully one day , it 'll be a paid sport			0
