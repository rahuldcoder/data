@entity0 -- an @entity3 sergeant complained about faulty wiring in @entity5 months before another soldier was fatally electrocuted in a shower in the same quarters , according to documents released wednesday by a congressional committee			1
@entity11 , a 24 - year - old @entity12 , died in his shower january 2			1
sgt. @entity14 filled out a work order in july 2007 that warned , " pipes have voltage , get shocked in the shower			1
" @entity14 told investigators from the @entity21 that at least once , he had to use a wooden stick to turn off the shower " because the electrical current was so strong			2
" army records show that electricians from contractor @entity27 found " several safety issues concerning the improper grounding of electrical devices " in february 2007			1
in january 2008 , staff sgt. @entity11 was electrocuted in a shower in the same quarters where @entity14 lived the previous summer			1
a follow - up investigation " found nearly all of the same problems and deficiencies that had been reported one year previously , " a committee report states			0
@entity11 and @entity38 had been based at a @entity40 - era palace complex near the @entity42 airport			2
@entity38 's concerns were not shared with the @entity45 's inspector - general 's office			0
that office concluded that there was " no credible evidence " that @entity27 and the @entity45 agency that oversees defense contractors were aware of electrical problems at the facility , committee chairman @entity53 said during a wednesday hearing			1
but the @entity45 's inspector - general , @entity57 , said that his investigators " have absolved no one " and that he was not aware of the work orders @entity38 filed			0
" they 're certainly very dramatic , and they certainly are documents that we will have to spend a lot of time looking at , " he said			0
@entity53 , @entity67 , has led a @entity21 investigation into a series of electrical accidents in @entity5 that he said may have been responsible for the deaths of 19 @entity74 troops and contractors			0
but in the first appearance by a @entity27 executive before the panel , the company 's @entity42 engineering and construction manager blamed the @entity3 for the deaths			1
" the reality is that @entity27 's actions were not the cause of any of these terrible accidents , " @entity83 said			2
@entity27 is a former subsidiary of the oilfield - services giant @entity88 , once led by vice president @entity89 , and it holds the largest @entity74 service contract in @entity5			2
@entity92 's argument drew sharp questions from rep. @entity94 , the committee 's ranking @entity95 , who pressed him on who was responsible for the deaths			0
" i think that the @entity3 has some responsibility in this , " @entity92 said			2
" well , if they have some , who would have the rest ? " the @entity101 representative asked			0
" just conceivably , who else could have it , if the @entity3 just has some responsibility ? would @entity27 have some then ? " " the responsibility lies with the @entity3 , " @entity92 replied			1
he said the @entity3 never authorized the electrical repairs identified in early 2007 or in a follow - up report that november			1
but @entity53 said the @entity3 had been warning of electrical hazards in @entity5 since 2004 , including one fatality similar to @entity113 's			1
a report that year warned @entity74 commanders that contractors must properly ground electrical systems			0
" but despite these warnings , few actions were taken by @entity45 leadership or @entity27 officials , " @entity53 said			2
@entity122 , executive director of the @entity123 , said the service does not have the expertise to adequately oversee contractors ' electrical work			1
the service is working with the @entity130 " to obtain this expertise , " @entity128 said			0
@entity11 's parents have filed a wrongful - death lawsuit in a @entity135 court against @entity27			1
despite the attention focused on the issue by @entity53 's committee , sen. @entity136 , @entity135 , said that poor wiring remains " a genuine danger to our men and women serving in @entity5			0
" " my office has heard from several active - duty soldiers a report that as recently as three weeks ago , soldiers in @entity5 continued to receive electrical shocks on a regular basis as they carry out their daily activities , including taking showers , " @entity136 told the committee			0
do you have a tip or story idea ? send it to the @entity1 : @entity158			0
@entity1 's @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity161 contributed to this report .			0
