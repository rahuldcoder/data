editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			0
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity19 , @entity20 ( @entity9 ) -- travel twenty minutes north of this tiny town , to the craggy red desert of the @entity23 , and you may discover a spaceship			1
the cylindrical craft is n't from another world , but it offers a glimpse of one			0
it is the centerpiece of the @entity31 , an environment created by the @entity33 , a growing non-profit organization that supports the research , exploration , and eventual colonization of the mysterious red planet			1
the swell , chosen as a simulation site for its topical resemblance to @entity31 , provides the volunteer researchers who come here with an opportunity to live and work in a @entity31 analog , an environment that 's as close to the red planet as is earthly possible			1
while conducting geological and psychological experiments that could someday be useful to a real @entity48 expedition , this small group of @entity31 devotees -- some space scientists , some simply eager adventurers -- live and work in complete " sim			1
" they consume only dehydrated , shelf - stable food like @entity57 and ghee , exercise to preserve their muscles in " reduced gravity , " abide by the " if it 's yellow , let it mellow " adage in an effort to conserve water , and wear spacesuits when they venture outside			1
animating their work is a vision of planetary colonization that is steadily creeping from the realm of sci - fi to reality			1
with the retirement of the @entity76 , @entity74 is shifting its focus to longer - term manned missions -- a dream that has been outlined by president @entity80			0
" our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn , operate and live safely beyond the @entity85 for extended periods of time , ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite , " the president told @entity74 in april of 2010			2
he then followed this up stating by the mid 2030s , " i believe we can send humans to orbit @entity31 and return them safely to @entity85			2
and landing on @entity31 will follow			0
" see the rest of @entity31 on @entity85 at @entity9 even if trips to @entity31 are still decades away , public interest appears to be reaching new heights			0
after the @entity100 published a paper in october suggesting that the first trips to @entity31 would be feasible only as one - way journeys , the journal 's editor received over 400 emails from people " volunteering " for the mission			2
@entity108 's @entity107 recently paid a visit to the @entity31 to get a glimpse of what life on @entity31 looks like on @entity85			2
compared with present government - run experiments , like @entity74 's undersea @entity113 and the @entity115 's @entity114 -- a six - man , 18 - month - long isolation test inside a mock spaceship -- life in the @entity33 's desert station can sometimes look like an elaborate make - believe game for grown - ups			1
but this is n't a lark or a theoretical exercise : living in a state of constant " dress - up , " in the words of crew member @entity129 , is meant to prepare for the possibility of life -- human life -- on @entity31 .			1

volunteer researchers live and work at station in the @entity20 desert , simulating life on @entity31
environment created by group that supports exploration and colonization of the @entity144
researchers wear spacesuits outside , consume only dehydrated , shelf - stable food
