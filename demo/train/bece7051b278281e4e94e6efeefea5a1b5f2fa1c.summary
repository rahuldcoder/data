-- when @entity2 started to clean up the mess caused by @entity4 , he could n't help thinking he was weeks behind schedule			1
it was two months after the storm , and his crane operating company had just been hired to help in @entity9			0
" i wondered what it would have been like if i had been there on day one , " @entity2 said			1
frustrated by the kind of bureaucratic red tape that delayed aid after @entity4 , @entity2 started the @entity16 , a mobile , " 24 - hour - a - day firehouse " that provides free emergency aid within hours of a catastrophe			1
since 2007 , the nonprofit group has responded to many of the country 's worst natural disasters , including floods in @entity27 and @entity28 and tornadoes in @entity30 and @entity31			0
today , @entity2 finds himself back in @entity9			1
but this time he 's dealing with a manmade catastrophe : the @entity34 oil spill			1
" this is a different kind of disaster , " said @entity2 , one of three @entity35 featured in a recent tv special , " @entity35 : coming back from @entity4			1
" " when a hurricane comes in , it can be cleaned up			0
oil is not that easily cleaned up			2
oil could stay around for decades			2
" the @entity16 has spent the past two months setting up dams and using specialized equipment to vacuum oil from @entity9 's barrier islands			0
" i remember clearly the first day the oil reached the beaches of @entity49 , where we were serving , " @entity2 said			1
" and it was a very emotional response ... to seeing these beautiful beaches and these beautiful animals covered in oil			0
and the only thing i can explain is that i felt very patriotic			0
i felt like , this is our land , this is our soil , this is our beaches , our wildlife , and it was being destroyed and contaminated			0
it was sad to see in person			0
" @entity2 said the spill has also delivered a devastating blow to a community still reeling from @entity4			1
" you 're dealing with people that have already lost everything -- everything , " @entity2 said			1
" they had nothing left but each other basically to begin with			0
and now , only a short few years later , their livelihoods are being threatened			0
" phasing out the @entity76 trailers many families in @entity9 are still living in trailers that were provided after @entity4 by the @entity76			1
@entity79 is trying to change that			2
@entity79 and her boyfriend , @entity81 , started the nonprofit @entity82 in 2006			2
" our goal is to get those last 1,000 families out of @entity76 trailers and back into their homes , " said @entity79 , who was voted @entity35 in 2008			1
the @entity82 , based in @entity88 , @entity9 , rebuilds damaged houses with the help of volunteers and skilled supervisors			0
@entity79 says it costs , on average , about $ 12,000 to turn a gutted home into a livable one			2
" to date , we 've done just about 300 houses , " she said			0
" we 've got more than 50 under construction			0
" the @entity82 has also opened up a mental health clinic in its office for those struggling to cope with the @entity4 and oil spill aftermath			1
" we decided we could n't sit by and not do anything [ about the spill ] , " @entity79 said			1
" so we 've launched our oil spill response that is focusing primarily on providing mental health services to people in the fishing communities			1
" focusing on children another @entity35 , @entity110 , is helping to shape @entity9 's future with his after - school music program , @entity113			1
headquartered in @entity115 ' @entity114 , the @entity113 provides free instruments and tutoring to more than 100 students between the ages of 9 and 14			2
the idea is to connect children to the city 's rich musical tradition while keeping them off its dangerous streets			0
" we have got a lot done in @entity115 , but we have a lot more to do , especially when it comes down to the kids , " @entity110 said			1
" i think we have to focus on them a little a bit more , what 's going on in their lives and what 's catching their attention and what 's keeping their attention			0
" the roots of @entity141 caught the attention of actor @entity143 , who donated money to its cause and helped organize a benefit concert in may			0
" this organization has a goal of taking someone in middle school and putting them on the road to a college education , self - confidence and leadership , " @entity143 said			2
the program is so popular that @entity110 has had to freeze applications for the time being			1
but he said he has been approached about possibly turning the roots of @entity141 into a charter school			0
" if i take 500 , 600 kids in the program , i might as well take them in a school , " he said			2
" they can be with me more than just part of the day			0
you have more interaction with those kids , and you can start to [ know ] the kids more and really start to help them out in the areas they need help in			0
" while he acknowledges that much work still needs to be done in @entity115 , @entity110 says he is hopeful about the future			1
and he is proud at how his city has bounced back from @entity4			1
" @entity115 has been a model city as far as recovery , " he said			2
" it 's really shown everybody how to pull together and make things work with little resources			0
