a @entity1 jury wednesday found former pharmaceuticals executive @entity2 guilty of first - degree manslaughter for feeding a lethal drug concoction to her autistic 8 - year - old son			1
the jury accepted her claim that she acted in a state of " extreme emotional disturbance			2
" @entity9 faces a 5 - to 25 - year prison sentence			1
" @entity2 showed no mercy to her son , and should receive none at the time of her sentencing , " manhattan district attorney @entity11 said in a statement			1
@entity9 , 53 , displayed little emotion as the verdict was announced at the close of a sensational two - month trial in @entity22 , in which prosecutors described in chilling detail how the businesswoman , who made a fortune in pharmaceuticals , forced little @entity28 to swallow a cocktail of painkillers and anti-inflammatories in 2010			1
prosecutors said @entity9 , who testified that she killed the boy to prevent him from being sexually abused , forced many of the drugs down his throat with a syringe			1
@entity9 's defense lawyers , citing legal errors during the long proceedings , said they will appeal and seek a new trial			1
" this was not a murder case , " defense attorney @entity43 said outside court			1
" and that 's because there were extenuating and horrific circumstances			2
and , apparently the jurors got it			0
" defense lawyer @entity52 said the verdict was a victory			2
" she loved him so much that she could n't bear the thought of him living without her , or him being subjected to the life she tried to rescue him from , " he said			0
" any time someone is convicted of a crime , particularly of the crime of having caused the death of a young child , there 's nothing to revel in			0
there 's no glory or triumph here			0
to the extent that the jury has said this was not a mother viciously , violently , coldly doing away with her child , that 's a triumph			2
" defense : she was a desperate mother at her trial , which started on september 10 , no one disputed the unthinkable manner in which @entity28 spent his final hours on february 5 , 2010			1
police found his cold body after they were dispatched to the luxury @entity88 in @entity22			2
the call to police came after a relative of @entity9 's was unable to reach her			0
when police arrived at the hotel , they found @entity9 sitting next to the bed where her son lay unresponsive , surrounded by pills and pill bottles			1
an autopsy found four of the painkillers and anti-inflammatories used to kill the boy still undigested in his stomach			1
@entity106 and vodka were used to wash down the drugs			2
prosecutor @entity109 presented expert testimony that showed the boy 's injuries were consistent with @entity9 climbing on top of @entity114 and holding open his mouth as she poured the lethal cocktail			0
but @entity52 painted a portrait of @entity9 as a desperate mother ultimately driven to kill @entity28 by her two former husbands			1
the defense said one ex-husband had allegedly threatened to kill her , a crime that would have left @entity28 with her other former husband -- his biological father -- who she believed had sexually abused the boy			1
" this was not an act carried out with murderous intent , " @entity52 told jurors in closing arguments			0
the prosecution said there was no evidence @entity28 was ever sexually abused			1
on the stand , @entity9 , a former nurse who started a home health care company , portrayed her actions as a mercy killing			0
her ex-husband was threatening to kill her , she said			0
" you 're a dead woman , " she claimed he told her			0
" i made the decision i was going to end my life and @entity28 's life , " she told the jury , placing her hand over her mouth			1
@entity9 said the boy was physically and sexually abused not only by his biological father but also by others , including the woman who took @entity28 to school			1
she testified that the boy was assaulted by " a good number of people			0
" the boy 's father has denied the allegations and has not been charged , @entity158 affiliate @entity157 has reported			2
@entity163 communication disputed while on the stand , @entity9 at first appeared calm as she described for a jury the last time she saw her son alive			2
@entity28 's vocabulary was limited			1
he typed on a @entity163 to communicate with her			0
" we were typing throughout some period of time			0
we were saying goodbye to each other , " @entity9 told the jury and then began to cry			0
" at some point , i put the pills together , " she recalled			0
" i gave him the pills			0
" " which drugs did you give him more of ? " @entity52 asked			2
" a lot more of the @entity183 , " she said			0
" i gave him more @entity185 , but the @entity183 is the one i gave him the most of			0
i gave him @entity188 , which were large			0
i was drinking a vodka orange and there was a little left			0
i broke up the pill and put it into the juice mixed with vodka			0
" but the prosecution challenged the idea that @entity28 was actually communicating via a @entity163 through the use of a controversial method known as " facilitated communication			1
" some witnesses described how @entity9 held the device in one hand while supporting and possibly guiding her son 's arm with the other as @entity28 looked away			1
@entity109 questioned whether a young autistic boy would even know how to use and spell words like " aggressively " and " sadistic			2
" @entity52 sought to show that @entity9 , believing she was ultimately protecting her son , brought the drugs to the hotel room with the intention of killing them both , but she survived the suicide attempt			1
prosecutors said the killing was premeditated and @entity9 expected to survive			2
as @entity28 lay dying , the prosecution said , @entity9 sent an email to a financial adviser instructing him to transfer the $ 125,000 trust she set up for her son to her personal account			1
in addition , @entity9 transferred $ 8 million from a savings to a checking account before checking into the hotel with her son			1
@entity9 told the jury she planned on giving the money to charity before taking her life .			0

the defense says the desperate mother aimed to protect her son from a sexually abusive father
