@entity0 -- @entity5 " had a real monkey on his back " with a longtime drug addiction his family kept secret from the world , and it led to his overdose death , a lawyer for @entity11 said			1
the concert promoter 's defense against the @entity7 's wrongful death lawsuit begins tuesday and will include testimony from " all of the many , many doctors " who treated @entity5 over the past decades , @entity11 attorney @entity12 said			1
it will also include a parade of @entity5 family members , including a return appearance by matriarch @entity23 , who just concluded two days of testimony as her lawyers presented their case			1
" they kept his private world private as best they could and now they would like to blame somebody else for things that only they knew privately , " @entity12 said			1
@entity5 's mother and three children contend @entity11 , which was producing and promoting his comeback concerts , is liable in his death because it negligently hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity38			1
@entity5 's mom faces cross examination in death trial @entity38 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in @entity5 's death , which the coroner ruled was caused by an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol			1
the doctor told investigators he was using the drug to treat @entity5 's insomnia as he prepared for his " @entity53 " debut in @entity52			1
@entity5 , not @entity11 , chose and controlled @entity38 , @entity12 argued			1
he said in his opening statements at the start of the trial 12 weeks ago he would show jurors " ugly stuff " about @entity5 to prove that @entity11 executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments the doctor was giving in the privacy of @entity5 's bedroom			1
the appearance of @entity23 , @entity5 's 83 - year - old mother , as a concluding witness in her case gave @entity67 a chance to probe what family members knew about @entity5 's drug abuse history			1
" there are a lot of enormous inconsistencies in what is being said and what the truth is , " @entity12 told reporters monday after he finished his cross-examination of @entity23			1
she " reported to the world and to the press that he never had a problem with prescription drugs , " that he never entered drug rehab and that the family never attempted an intervention to stop his drug use , he said			0
" as we now know , @entity5 had a longtime problem with prescription drugs , so what had been told to the world during his lifetime was n't true			1
" the @entity7 's lawyer , @entity96 , said @entity11 executives were " in the best position to help @entity5 " when they saw his health deteriorating in the last two months of his life			1
show director @entity100 sent a series of e-mails to top @entity11 executives warning them that @entity5 showed " strong signs of paranoia , anxiety and obsessive - like behavior " at a rehearsal			1
" i think the very best thing we can do is get a top psychiatrist in to evaluate him asap , " @entity100 wrote			0
" it 's like there are two people there			2
one ( deep inside ) trying to hold on to what he was and still can be and not waiting us to quit him , the other in this weakened and troubled state			0
" production manager @entity121 sent an e-mail to producers saying he " watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks			0
he was able to do multiple 360 spins back in april			0
he 'd fall on his ass if he tried now			0
" " they knew he was having a problem , " @entity96 said			0
" he needed them for this concert			0
they could have easily told him , ' look , until you go see the appropriate doctor and come back , we 're not going on with the rehearsal			0
' they 're the only ones that really had the ability to do something about it and they chose not to			0
" @entity100 testified this month that he thought @entity11 should have halted production on the show until @entity5 was well			1
mother : ' i want to know what really happened ' despite the e-mail evidence and testimony , @entity12 insisted monday that @entity11 executives knew nothing about @entity5 's failing health			1
" they had little interaction with @entity5 in terms of the production and promotion of that , " @entity12 said , adding that the executives " certainly " did not know " that he was having any problems			2
" but @entity96 said the executives should have known : " he was deteriorating in front of their own eyes			0
" " they watched him waste away , " @entity23 testified			2
@entity5 testified in her first day on the stand friday that she filed the lawsuit " because i want to know what really happened to my son			2
" during cross-examination , the @entity11 lawyer played a clip from an interview she gave to @entity171 a year after her son 's death in which she said @entity5 had hired the doctor			1
in response , her lawyer argued she made the statement before seeing @entity11 e-mails indicating that the company hired him			1
@entity12 questioned her about a statement she and several of her children signed in 2007 accusing @entity182 of publishing " untrue and inaccurate information " about @entity5 's drug use			1
" we categorically deny ever planning , participating in , or having knowledge of any kind of intervention , whatsoever , " the statement read			0
@entity23 acknowledged , however , that she participated in an attempted intervention with her son at his @entity192 in 2002			2
" i wanted them to stop lying , " she testified , referring to the magazine			0
" i was worried about all the lies they were telling about the family			0
" " was it a lie to say your son had a problem with prescription drugs ? " @entity12 asked			0
" he did not have a problem , " she insisted			0
@entity12 later asked @entity5 's mother if she liked to " shut your ears to bad things			1
" " i do n't like to hear bad news , " she said			0
@entity5 appeared combative at times when @entity12 cross-examined her , punching back at his questions			2
" what does this have to do with my son dying ? " she replied at one point			0
" i think she was badgered , but that was n't the first time , " @entity96 told reporters later			2
" in her deposition , she was asked questions like , " does your husband ever beat you ? ' " doctor : promoter knew about @entity5 's drug dependency for the pretrial deposition , she was questioned for about 12 hours over three days			1
@entity12 denied he was being overly aggressive in his questioning of her			0
" i just wanted to know the facts from her and there was no reason to be aggressive with her , " he said			0
" she was combative , but you ca n't blame mrs. @entity23 for that			1
none of us want to find ourselves in a situation where we 're having to confront the very public death of our child			0
" @entity12 refused to discuss why he asked @entity23 in the deposition if her husband , @entity244 , ever beat her			2
" what occurred in those depositions was confidential at mrs. @entity23 's request , therefore i am not at liberty to go into to the private matters that we went into in that deposition , " @entity12 told @entity1			2
however , @entity23 and her lawyer both brought up the question in court monday			1
" i am not going to go into what we went into about the very tragic history @entity5 had with his parents and father over the period of his life , " @entity12 said			2
" that is something we did not go into on the stand because it is not relevant			0
i 'm not bringing that up			0
" @entity11 executive @entity268 is on the witness stand tuesday as the company 's defense presentation begins			2
testimony is expected to last into september , the judge told the jury .			0
