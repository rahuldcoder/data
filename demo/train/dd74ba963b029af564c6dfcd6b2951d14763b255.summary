yet another war in the @entity1 could bring devastation and tremendous international repercussions			0
so many people around the globe breathed a sign of relief thursday as word broke that @entity10 said it does not want to further escalate hostilities against @entity12			1
still , after a high - profile missile strike by @entity12 , days of missile attacks by the @entity16 militant group , and exchanges of fire , tensions are high			1
the possibility remains that a full - scale military confrontation could erupt -- as it did in 2006 while regional politics are at play , numerous other major factors are as well -- including oil prices , @entity26 , @entity28 's nuclear dispute with the @entity29 and the threat of @entity10 terrorist attacks around the world			1
here 's a look at what 's happening			0
this week , @entity10 fired five anti-tank missiles at @entity12 military vehicles near the @entity16 border , killing two soldiers and wounding seven others			1
@entity12 also evacuated a town that includes a popular ski resort following @entity10 attacks in the region			1
in skirmishes that followed , a @entity45 service member with the @entity47 peacekeeping force in @entity16 was killed			0
it 's unclear whether he was killed by @entity10 or @entity12 fire , the @entity47 said			1
@entity45 's @entity47 ambassador @entity52 said the violence " resulted from the rocket attacks launched by @entity10 " and " the artillery fire which followed			2
" when asked whose fire killed the peacekeeper , @entity52 said " it was because of the escalation of violence and it came from the @entity12 side			2
" but the next day , @entity63 , spokesman for @entity47 @entity64 ban ki - moon , said , " the precise cause of death is as yet undetermined and remains the subject of investigation			0
" all this follows an @entity12 airstrike last week in the @entity72 town of @entity73 that killed six @entity10 operatives and at least one member of @entity28 's @entity76			1
@entity28 state media said gen. @entity78 was killed , but the @entity79 reported that six @entity28 commanders were killed			2
" the attack delivered perhaps the highest - profile blow to @entity10 and @entity28 interests in @entity72 since the outbreak of war there , " @entity81 wrote on @entity82			1
among those killed was @entity90			0
in his 20s , he was the son of one of @entity10 's founders , @entity92 , who was killed in a 2008 bombing in @entity95 , @entity72			2
@entity90 's death " represented a symbolic blow to the @entity98 group that his father helped to found with @entity28 backing in the early 1980s , " the @entity79 reported			2
although @entity10 is based in @entity16 , it is aligned with and supports the regime of @entity72 president @entity104			2
@entity28 supports both the @entity72 regime and @entity10 as well			1
the fighting has been taking place in the region in which @entity16 and @entity72 border the @entity12 - controlled @entity109			1
the @entity12 tank that was struck was in @entity111 , also known as @entity111 , a disputed strip of land			2
neither @entity12 nor @entity10 wants the situation to spiral into a war , analysts say			1
" i think @entity12 's trying to defend its borders " and is concerned about attacks from " a well - known terrorist group " across the border , said @entity117 , author of the 2013 book " @entity10 : the @entity123 of @entity16 's @entity10			1
" in @entity10 , there are elements that would like to escalate , said @entity117 , director of the counterterrorism program at the @entity127			0
but " the attack against the @entity12 patrol really does appear calculated to minimize response			0
you do n't have a force going into @entity12 proper , you do n't have the attempts to snatch bodies , " he said			0
in 2006 , war broke out after @entity10 militants crossed into @entity12 , killing three soldiers and kidnapping two others , then killed another five @entity12 soldiers			1
timeline : decades of conflict in @entity16 , @entity12 @entity10 has many of its fighters at war in @entity72 on behalf of @entity104			1
but the group has others available to carry out attacks against @entity12			0
and it felt it had to respond to last week 's @entity12 airstrike on @entity73 , sending a message to " its community and its constituency , " said @entity117			0
@entity28 felt the same way			0
@entity153 viewed the @entity73 attack as " crossing a line that warrants a response , " said @entity157 , president of the @entity158 and author of " a @entity160 : @entity162 's diplomacy with @entity28			0
" all this is taking place against a backdrop of negotiations between @entity28 and @entity168 powers over its nuclear activities			0
the @entity12 - @entity10 dispute comes " at a pivotal time for the nuclear talks in a way that is not helpful for the @entity174 or @entity28 , " @entity157 said			1
depending on how the nuclear talks go , @entity28 may show restraint -- or the situation may escalate further , he said			0
@entity28 needs to make sure the situation cools down , said @entity178 , a former @entity179 official now at the @entity180			0
" @entity28 ca n't afford to let the fighting between @entity10 and @entity12 get out of hand as it did in 2006 , " he said			1
more than 1,000 people on the @entity16 side and more than 150 on the @entity12 side died in the war			1
" most scenarios involving an @entity12 strike on @entity28 's nuclear program involve a simultaneous push into @entity16 to blunt @entity10 's ability to retaliate and fire missiles into @entity12			1
if @entity12 and @entity10 's skirmish descends into war and @entity10 rocket fire , then the @entity12 might figure in for a penny , in for a pound " -- in other words , fighting back against @entity10 might mean going after @entity28 's nuclear sites			1
" if things escalate to the point where @entity10 starts firing missiles at @entity12 cities , then @entity12 might figure that 's as good a green light as any to get the job done , " @entity178 said			1
( @entity153 insists it only wants nuclear energy ; western nations , including the @entity174 , and @entity12 believe @entity28 seeks nuclear weaponry			2
) the @entity12 - @entity10 dynamic also has implications for the fight against the @entity26 terror network			1
the @entity174 and @entity28 both oppose @entity26			2
@entity174 officials have opened channels of communication with @entity28 over it			0
( " @entity174 and @entity28 both @entity26 , but try not to look like allies , " read a @entity219 headline			2
) the fighting between @entity10 -- a @entity226 militant group -- and @entity12 " should highlight the dangers of relying on @entity28 against @entity223 extremists like @entity26			1
rather than bring stability or security , @entity10 's actions show that the @entity174 would simply be swapping one flavor of extremism for another , " @entity178 said			0
another piece of the puzzle is the oil market			0
the drop in oil prices is hurting @entity28 , @entity10 's sponsor			1
" the @entity28 spent a lot of money helping @entity10 repair @entity16 in the wake of the 2006 war			1
price of oil going down , stretched in @entity72 , @entity28 is simply not flush and i do n't think wants it this time around , " former @entity245 official @entity244 , now with the @entity246 , told @entity2 's @entity247			2
@entity28 is also struggling from sanctions over its nuclear activities and is " funneling billions of dollars to the @entity72 regime , " the @entity249 reports			0
@entity10 has had to tighten its belt			0
but there 's another way @entity10 can flex its muscle : through further terrorist attacks elsewhere in the world , said @entity117			0
the group has a long history of attacks overseas , including one at the @entity264 barracks in @entity265 , @entity16 , in 1983 that killed 241 @entity174			0
@entity267 found @entity10 was behind an attack on a bus that killed five @entity12 tourists in 2012			2
@entity271 reported thwarting a bomb attempt late last year			0
authorities announced they would press charges against a man who confessed to being a member of @entity10 , @entity273 reported			0
ever since the militant group 's military chief @entity92 was killed in the 2008 bombing , @entity10 has been trying to carry out new terrorist attacks around the world in response , @entity117 said .			0

@entity12 and @entity10 have *stepped* up fighting in recent days
neither side wants a full - scale war , analysts believe
@entity28 , oil , @entity26 and more all play into the scenario
