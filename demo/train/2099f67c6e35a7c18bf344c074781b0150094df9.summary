-- in @entity0 , the spiritual home of @entity6 stars and starlets , a sparkling new icon is on the rise			1
stretching fully 442 meters ( 1,450 feet ) above the @entity1 city 's busy financial district and playing host to some 300 high - class apartments , the @entity14 tower will become one of the world 's tallest residential buildings anywhere when completed in 2014			1
according to @entity19 , deputy managing director of the @entity20 ( the real estate company behind the project ) the giant structure is a symbol of the rapid development that has transformed @entity0 into a vibrant , modern destination in recent years			2

@entity31 , ( the ) @entity32 and so on			0
but @entity0 did n't have a similar landmark like that which identified the city as being the next financial center of a global nation , " @entity19 said			1
" @entity14 is our way to contribute in a different way , to say that we are globally on the map as @entity1 , globally on the map as @entity0 , " he added			1
@entity0 's new foundations @entity19 and his organization represent a new breed of high - class property developers reshaping the very foundations of @entity0			1
the company has 40 projects currently in the works across the fast changing metropolis where luxury flats are trading for as high as $ 8,000 per square meter and luxury villas at $ 12,000 per square meter			0
these costly sums put @entity0 in the same league as some of the most expensive cities in the developed world and equate to " about 70 % of residential prices compared to midtown @entity63 , " explained @entity64 , chairman of real estate specialists @entity66			1
" compared to @entity68 in @entity69 it is about 80 % and to @entity71 in @entity72 it is about 90 % , " he added			0
but while rising luxury property prices equals good news for those with the means to snap - up an early deal , the investing class represents just a tiny fraction of the 20 million @entity1 that call @entity0 home			1
the vast majority live in far more modestly priced housing or travel from far outside to work in the city			0
with real estate and rents booming in downtown areas , however , many of @entity0 's factories and employers are relocating to sites on the city 's outskirts			1
see also : @entity94 moves to cool property market this is a trend recognized by @entity97 from the @entity98 who mourns the fact that an increasing number of the city 's inhabitants are now being forced to travel for hours to reach their places of work			1
" all the companies in @entity0 are there but the only thing is they have shifted their manufacturing from inner @entity0 to outer @entity0 , " she said			2
cities in the suburbs out of this altering landscape , however , some see the opportunity to reshape @entity0 even further			1
the @entity20 is behind plans to develop entire new towns from scratch on the outskirts of @entity0 to meet the changing needs and demography of the city			2
one such development is @entity123 , a 16 square kilometer city that will offer schools , hospitals , its own police force and fire stations for 80,000 people			0
" there is a real case for saying that someone needs to come together and say we are going to house industry in the way that it creates long term benefits for both the people living in it and for the city , " said @entity19			0
" ( this ) can only happen if you look at it from a 20 year perspective which can happen only towards the suburban areas of @entity0			2

he bought four units in @entity123 for himself and his family in 2010 at a cost of $ 300 per square meter			0
today the same space sells for $ 750 per square meter , a doubling of his initial investment in just three years			0
but for a new generation of @entity1 home - buyers like , @entity147 it 's not all about the value of the returns			2
" they have found this place is a nice place for the next generation and their wives and elders , " he says			0
