@entity13 , @entity14 : a former dictator shows back up in his home country 25 years after he was forced out of power			1
what happened ? we have the answer in today 's edition of @entity0 ! first up : @entity22 @entity23 : first up , an early - morning earthquake hits @entity4			1
this happened around 1:30 a.m. local time on wednesday in a remote area in southwestern @entity4			2
officials said the quake had an initial magnitude of 7.2			2
that would mean it was a " major " quake			2
there were reports that it lasted 20 or 30 seconds			2
one scientist said it 's not uncommon for earthquakes to hit this region			1
@entity40 & @entity42 relationship @entity23 : well , the leaders of the world 's two largest economies get together in @entity46 we 're talking about president @entity48 and @entity40 president @entity49			1
the @entity40 leader is in the @entity42 for a visit			1
the two presidents are scheduled to sit down today to talk about some of the issues that are important to both nations			1
president @entity49 landed in @entity46 yesterday			0
in addition to president @entity48 , the @entity40 leader is scheduled to sit down with leaders in @entity59 and business executives			1
the issue of trade is likely to come up at all of those meetings			0
the @entity42 and @entity40 economies are connected in a lot of ways , and each country has had some complaints about the other one 's policies			1
@entity71 has more for us on the connections between the @entity42 and @entity40 and the current status of the relationship between these two world powers			1
( begin video ) @entity78 , @entity0 @entity79 : two nations oceans apart , locked in a complex relationship that will help chart the 21st century			0
@entity82 , @entity42 secretary of state : today , our relationship has gone global			1
we debate and discuss nearly every major international issue			0
@entity87 : friends or rivals ? a former deputy secretary of state says for the @entity42 , @entity40 is both			1
@entity91 , former deputy secretary of state : they are a factor of life as the second largest economy in the world , by every measure , whether it 's political , social , economic , and for that matter security			1
and furthermore , they have very key interests of their own in areas that are extraordinarily important to us			0
@entity87 : spin the globe and you see @entity40 's growing competition with the @entity42 for access and influence			1
from @entity112 , where @entity40 craves oil and other resources , to @entity115 , in search of commodities and alternatives to its heavy investment in the @entity42 for many @entity42 , @entity40 , for years , has meant bargains			1
but increasingly , @entity40 means jobs for @entity42 at home			1
@entity42 treasury secretary @entity125 : our exports to @entity40 are growing at twice the rate of growth of our exports to the rest of the world			1
these exports support hundreds of thousands of jobs across the nation in all sectors			0
@entity42 defense secretary @entity137 : we welcome a @entity40 that plays a constructive role on the world stage			1
@entity87 : yet @entity40 's burgeoning military power is stoking concern in @entity143 and the @entity42 @entity144 : but questions about its intentions and opaque military modernization program have been a source of concern to its neighbors			1
@entity87 : @entity46 says with power comes responsibility			0
for now , @entity40 looks outward , mostly to benefit itself @entity154 : @entity40 's outreach , i believe , in the main is based on what they perceive is their economic and political interest			1
however , it is the case that this compels them on occasion to deal with what we consider pariah regimes			0
@entity87 : the @entity42 really needs @entity40 's help in pressing @entity168 and @entity169 on their nuclear programs			1
but on every world issue , from terrorism to climate change to piracy on the high seas , @entity46 also looks to @entity177			1
@entity178 : embracing the obligations that come with being a 21st century power will help to realize a future that will give the @entity40 people even more , in fact , unimagined opportunities			1
but that means accepting a share of the burden of solving common problems , @entity87 : and that , @entity178 argues , includes respecting human rights , releasing political prisoners and protecting ethnic minorities in @entity192			0
( @entity193 ) health care repeal ? @entity23 : moving on to our next story today			1
the @entity42 @entity198 , there 's a vote scheduled today to repeal , or overturn , the controversial health care reform law			1
during last year 's midterm election campaigns , a lot of @entity202 said they 'd try to overturn the law if they were elected			2
they won a majority in the @entity198 , so this vote is a way for them to keep that promise			0
most people though -- including most @entity202 -- do n't expect the health care law to be completely overturned			0
that 's because an outright repeal has to be passed by the @entity198 and the @entity216 , and democrats have a majority in the @entity216			2
@entity219 @entity220 , @entity14 : today 's first @entity221 goes out to mr. @entity222 and ms. @entity224 's class at @entity225 in @entity226 , @entity227 ! @entity228 is a former dictator of what country ? is it : a ) @entity232 , b ) @entity231 , c ) @entity234 or @entity235 ) @entity5 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity228 ruled @entity5 for 15 years ; he was forced out of the country in 1986			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! " @entity228 " returns @entity23 : " @entity228 " @entity228 is back in @entity5 this week			1
he showed up in the @entity243 nation on sunday			0
yesterday , he was taken into custody while authorities decided whether or not to officially arrest him			0
human rights groups say that while @entity228 was in power , thousands of @entity5 were killed or tortured			1
he was also accused of taking money from the country 's treasury			1
no one 's really sure why " @entity228 " -- he 's the person waving -- returned to @entity5			1
one of his associates said it was connected to the anniversary of last year 's earthquake			2
@entity228 was given control of the country by his father , who was known as " @entity259 " that 's how the younger @entity228 got the nickname " @entity228 " shoutout @entity261 @entity262 , @entity14 : time for a @entity263 ! which of these countries is part of the @entity267 ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity6 , b ) @entity271 , c ) @entity274 or @entity235 ) @entity275 ? rewind the clock to three seconds -- go ! of these options , only @entity6 is part of the @entity267			1
that 's your answer and that 's your @entity263 ! @entity282 @entity23 : the area around the @entity267 , specifically , the waters off the coast of @entity6 , is home to more pirate attacks than anywhere else in the world			2
that 's according to a new report that found 2010 was the worst year ever for piracy worldwide			1
@entity293 looks at some of the ways companies and governments can protect themselves from pirates			1
( begin video ) @entity293 , @entity0 correspondent : the hope is this can ward off pirates			0
it may seem laughable , but mannequins posing as guards in the dead of night could fool pirates and force them to flee			0
there are other tactics , as one @entity310 commander tells me			0
@entity312 , @entity310 commander : barbed wire , perhaps , around their ship			0
they have extra lookouts posted to look for @entity6 pirates			0
they have a routine where they can find fire flares , water hoses , etc. @entity325 : warships try to stop pirates before they hit major shipping lanes like the @entity329			2
the captain would have seen a skiff out there and then ordered out the @entity333 to go and deal with the pirates			0
@entity334 : we take away their equipment			0
we take away their mother ships , which is damaging to them , and then send them back to shore			0
@entity325 : in @entity345 , @entity346 , the @entity343 commander of this warship supports operations around @entity6 for the @entity348 , @entity349			0
he tells me what 's tough			2
@entity352 , @entity354 @entity353 : the area is really huge			0
the area of operation is equal about the size of the @entity42			1
@entity325 : just compare the size here			0
a powerful warship like this one , completely outfitted with weapons and technology , is chasing around boats smaller than the size of this one out on the @entity365			0
deep in a building in central @entity369 , one private , maritime security firm has got a bird 's - eye view			2
they 're watching feeds , tracking vessels and weather patterns			0
@entity375 , maritime underwater security consultancy : we analyze them to try and create a picture of what 's real and what 's not			2
@entity325 : they help steer ships in real time , sometimes to rougher waters where small pirate skiffs ca n't operate			0
@entity375 : we always consider factors such as rainfall and most importantly the wind			0
@entity325 : everyone i speak to tells me there 's only one real solution for @entity6			2
that 's not on the sea , but on the shore , where only a government that works can control its people			2
for now , as @entity6 pirates plan attacks , real men , and , oh , let 's call them reinforcements , patrol the high seas hoping ships pass safely			2
( @entity193 ) before we go @entity23 : we have another singing sensation for today 's before we go segment			1
@entity406 , please take your seat			0
a quick look to make sure that the audience is paying attention			0
and now , you make sure you have the perfect pitch , and let the performance begin			0
something tells me this wo n't earn a standing ovation			0
the crooning canine 's owners say he practices at the piano three or four times every day			2
it sounds painful ! goodbye @entity23 : but i guess after a while , they just learned tune him out			0
luckily , they 're music and dog lovers			0
otherwise , that little guy might be flat			0
we hope you 'll note that @entity0 returns tomorrow , when we pitch out more commercial - free headlines			0
