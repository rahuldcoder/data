-- today , we are all mourning the loss of 298 people who died in the tragic crash of @entity5 17			1
@entity6 and @entity7 have been trading blame on who is responsible for shooting down the aircraft			1
as more details come in , @entity12 officials believe that @entity15 rebels fired the missiles			0
whatever the political repercussions are , the international community owes it to the deceased and their families to conduct an immediate , thorough , competent and , most important , independent investigation of what exactly happened and who is responsible			1
we can not afford to have another aviation accident investigation that appears to stumble at its outset			1
the families of the 298 innocents on board deserve competence and justice			1
most of those on board were @entity36 , but there were also @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , at least one @entity12 and a @entity42 crew			1
some of the world 's top @entity44 researchers were among those killed			0
clearly , given the political tensions between @entity6 and @entity7 and the disputed area in which the crash occurred , these two countries should not conduct the investigation			1
according to @entity54 of the @entity55 , multiple parties are entitled to be involved in the investigation			2
while our own @entity58 will have a say , since @entity60 in the @entity12 made the aircraft , we believe that the @entity62 should be the lead investigatory body , and it should be appointed immediately			0
the @entity62 was founded in 2005 , is noted for its thoroughness and technical skill , and has conducted many aviation investigations			0
its leader , chairman @entity67 , is a career politician and the national coordinator for security and counterterrorism			0
given his experience in both aviation and national security , he would be an outstanding fit for the work			0
it is vital that investigators get to the scene of the accident immediately			0
with unconfirmed reports that @entity6 rebels are combing through the wreckage and may even have possession of the black box , security at the crash site must be established to preserve evidence and allow investigators to determine how and why this aircraft was shot down			1
it is critical that investigators obtain possession of the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder , the " black box			0
" as the @entity58 did in the investigation of @entity98 using black box data , a sound spectrum study can provide telling information on where on the aircraft and when the explosion occurred			2
the @entity7 , the @entity6 and the rebels should commit immediately to full transparency and to guaranteeing the complete safety of the investigative team			1
anything short of that should bring immediate world condemnation and a denial of landing rights for flights originating in their respective countries			0
this is more than just an investigation of an aviation accident			2
our global economy is greatly dependent on aviation			2
people are able to access the farthest corners of the globe for business and family purposes with remarkable speed and unprecedented safety			2
if there is an ongoing threat that commercial airliners will be shot down , our global commerce will slow to a halt			2
in the @entity12 alone , 97.5 million passengers flew internationally on @entity12 airlines in 2013			0
the @entity135 is meeting today on the @entity137 tragedy , and it needs to show strong leadership to ensure that a true independent investigation is immediately launched			0
the world 's countries must stand up for safe and secure global travel , and by demanding a transparent and unfettered international investigation , they will take the first step in bringing those responsible to justice			1

298 people lost their lives in the crash of @entity5 17 in @entity6
@entity154 , @entity155 : there must be an immediate and competent investigation
they say @entity7 and @entity6 should not conduct investigation ; leave it to the @entity36
@entity154 , @entity163 : international community must stand up for safe and secure global travel
