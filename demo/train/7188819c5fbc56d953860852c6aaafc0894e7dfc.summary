during tuesday night 's @entity2 address , president @entity0 touted his administration 's efforts on reducing illegal immigration			0
the claim : " real reform means stronger border security , and we can build on the progress my administration has already made -- putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history , and reducing illegal crossings to their lowest levels in 40 years			2
" that 's a big claim , so @entity19 decided to take a closer look			0
the facts : in fiscal year 2011 , there were 18,506 @entity25 @entity24 agents in the @entity26 -- up steadily from 3,555 agents in 1992 , according to @entity29 figures			1
a @entity31 study finds that @entity24 apprehensions of all unauthorized immigrants are at their lowest level since 1971			1
" in spite of ( and perhaps because of ) increases in the number of @entity24 agents , apprehensions of @entity37 trying to cross the border illegally have plummeted in recent years — from more than 1 million in 2005 to 286,000 in 2011 — a likely indication that fewer unauthorized migrants are trying to cross , " it concluded			1
more fact checks : @entity45 gas mileage wind energy @entity31 estimates that net migration -- newly arrived immigrants minus those leaving ( forced or voluntarily ) -- has come to a standstill , which it attributes to the weakened @entity25 job and construction markets , border enforcement , an increase in deportations , and increased dangers associated with crossing the border			1
in all , there were 327,577 illegal immigrant apprehensions in 2011 , according to the @entity25 @entity24			1
this is the lowest number since 1972 , when there were 321,326			2
according to the @entity65 , the 2011 figure is a 53 % drop from 2008 , which it says indicates that fewer people are trying to cross the border			2
the figures can be tough to interpret			1
often , the same person is caught more than once , " and then the flip side of that phenomenon is there 's no way of knowing how many you missed counting , how many do get through , " said @entity76 , editor of @entity78 's @entity77 and an immigration lawyer at the @entity80 in @entity81 , @entity82			0
" so , you get what you measure			0
in other words , you count what you count			0
" but even if the border could be sealed in a foolproof manner , the issue of illegal immigration would not be resolved			0
that 's because many of those people who are in the @entity25 without authorization have entered the country legally on a visa and simply overstayed their visa status , @entity76 said			2
conclusion : @entity0 's comments appear to accurately summarize the current state of illegal immigration , though it 's impossible to determine with certainty how many illegal crossings may have occurred .			0
