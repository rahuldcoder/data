-- @entity2 's lawsuit against @entity3 for unauthorized use of his image on billboards ended monday with a $ 5 million settlement to be paid to the actor - director by the clothing company			1
@entity2 received $ 5 million to settle a suit with @entity3			2
@entity2 said the case should discourage advertisers from using celebrities ' images without permission , but @entity3 's head said he still thinks his company had a good defense			1
the settlement , announced just moments before jury selection was to begin in @entity21 , interrupted a trial that lawyers had hinted could include a parade of witnesses testifying about @entity2 's sex scandals			2
" threats and press leaks by @entity3 designed to smear me did not work , and a scheme to call a long list of witnesses who had nothing to do with the case was disallowed by the court , " @entity2 said			0
" i hope this very large settlement will discourage @entity3 and others from doing this type of thing to myself or others in the future			0
" @entity40 , founder and ceo of @entity3 , issued a statement published by @entity45 's @entity44 newspaper saying lawyers for his insurance company -- which will pay the money to @entity2 -- made the decision to settle the case			1
" for the record , i personally think we had a good case , " @entity40 said			0
@entity2 filed his suit , asking for $ 10 million , against @entity3 in march 2008 after the company placed several billboards and online ads using an image of @entity2 dressed as a @entity58 in his 1977 movie " @entity60			1
" " i sued @entity3 because they calculatingly took my name , my likeness and image and used them publicly to promote their business , " @entity2 said monday			1
" testimony revealed that @entity3 believed that fear of publicity would keep me from ever taking action , and so they put my face on billboards , on the @entity72 , and my image on their building , " he said			0
@entity40 , who said he finally could talk about the case , said the ad was a " an attempt to at least make a joke about " sexual harassment lawsuits filed against him and his company in recent years			0
" today , two years later , all the claims in the lawsuits have been completely disproven and yet at the time , some writers characterized me as a rapist and abuser of women , others asserted that i was a bad jew , and some even stated that i was not fit to run my company			0
" @entity40 said it was " ironic that i have to explain this to @entity2 when he has expressed similar frustrations in the past			0
" @entity3 lawyers wanted to call as witnesses @entity2 's former companion @entity97 and soon - @entity98 , @entity97 's adopted daughter and @entity2 's wife			1
@entity2 's relationship with -- and eventual marriage to -- @entity98 was scandal material for tabloids beginning in 1992 , when she was 21			2
@entity2 said the company 's lawyers may have been persuaded to settle because the judge made it " clear that the court considered their phony @entity111 ranting and claims of parody , sheer nonsense			2

@entity2 's image was used by @entity3 without his authorization
@entity2 sued ; insurance company made decision to settle , ceo says
