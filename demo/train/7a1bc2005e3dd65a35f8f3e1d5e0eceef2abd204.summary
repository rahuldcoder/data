-- citing the threat of avalanches , officials tuesday suspended the search for two hikers missing since friday morning on @entity6 and held out little hope they would be found alive			1
" could they be alive ? " asked dr. @entity8 , physician supervisor for @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11			1
is it very likely ? no. " the specialist in emergency medicine noted that time is not in their favor			2
" what we know is that at about 48 hours -- two days -- the chances of finding somebody alive after that go down to about 1 percent			1
" she added , " at some point , we have to say it 's time			0
" still , she said , @entity27 , 24 , and @entity28 , 29 , have several factors in their favor : " they 're young ; they 're healthy ; they -- as far as we can tell -- are relatively experienced and relatively well - equipped			2
" the body of a third hiker , 26 - year - old @entity34 , was found dead saturday from hypothermia			1
@entity10 sheriff @entity36 said tuesday that , despite the odds , the the search operation had not moved into a recovery operation			0
in fact , the search was not continuing in any form			0
operations coordinator @entity43 bemoaned the heavy snow that fell over the weekend and forced the suspension			1
" a lot of our clues are now covered , " he said			1
@entity49 , a team leader with @entity50 , said the avalanche danger would not permit rescuers to venture out any time soon			2
" slopes that do not normally avalanche are avalanching now , " he said			2
" i do n't see that we 're going to have conditions that will permit us to put anybody safely on the ground in the foreseeable future			0
" @entity43 hypothesized that the hikers may have been involved in an accident and that @entity34 , the most experienced of the hikers , may have broken away from the others and begun to backtrack in an effort to seek help			1
above his body , rescuers found a water bottle , a helmet , a harness , a camera and camera case and a mitten belonging to @entity73			2
" maybe @entity28 lost a mitten in an accident , " @entity43 said			0
if @entity34 did indeed seek to return for help and @entity73 lost one of her mittens in an accident , he may have left his gear , his pack and his supplies and gloves with her , taking the lone mitten , he said			1
but descending can be more difficult than climbing in some places			0
" if there was some form of an accident and @entity34 did downclimb , this is a much more difficult descent , " he said			1
@entity94 meteorologist @entity93 told @entity0 that some 15 inches of snow had fallen at an altitude of about 6,000 feet between monday and tuesday afternoon , when temperatures were just below freezing			0
the three hikers , all from the @entity100 , set out at about 1 a.m. friday ( 4 a.m. et ) , on what was to have been a fairly easy , " semi-technical " hike in which they would have descended the south side of the mountain , said deputy @entity106 of the @entity107			2
@entity27 's home is @entity109 , @entity110 ; @entity73 's is @entity111 , @entity11			0
@entity34 was from @entity112 , @entity110			1
@entity34 's @entity114 page is filled with photos of him hiking in various places			1
the mountain rises 11,239 feet above sea level , with a base that stretches across 92 miles ( 148 km )			0
it is the highest mountain in @entity11			0
@entity6 is a dormant volcano with steam constantly spewing from holes , according to the web site mthood.info			0
@entity34 's death is the latest of many accidents on @entity6 , @entity124 reported			1
the worst occurred in may 1986 when nine people , including seven students from @entity129 , died after they dug a snow cave during a sudden storm .			0
