-- from @entity2 to @entity3 , @entity1 is embracing its charming -- and sometimes cheeky -- past			2
every era , from the roaring ' 20s to the swinging ' 60s , is represented , with new takes on old - fashioned locales : chip and sweets shops , hidden @entity12 - style hangouts , even ballrooms			1

@entity76 ( named after the department store that once existed on its site ) is decidedly more adult ; the quirky basement bar in @entity2 is tricked out to feel like grandma 's -- complete with signature floral wallpaper and consciously stodgy décor			0
still , zany accents , like a fireplace full of discarded @entity87 bottles , reflect the underground boîte 's joie de vivre spirit of excess			0
