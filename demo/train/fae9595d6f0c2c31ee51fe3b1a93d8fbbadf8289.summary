-- @entity1 was 19 when she married her high school sweetheart			1
" it was probably the happiest point of my life , " she said			2
" i did n't need someone to complete my life			2
he made me want to be a better person			2
" two days after the wedding , @entity8 moved to @entity10 to be with her husband , @entity8 , who was stationed at an army base there , putting their honeymoon plans on hold			1
" he wanted to take me to @entity18 , " she remembered			2
but they never got to take that trip			2
on may 21 , 2007 , @entity8 came home to find two men waiting to tell her that her husband had been killed by a roadside bomb in @entity26			1
at 21 , @entity8 was a widow			2
consumed by grief , she felt she had nowhere to turn for support			0
after her husband was deployed to @entity26 , @entity8 moved back home to @entity31 , @entity32 , away from a military community			1
" i did n't live near any bases , " she said			0
" when @entity8 was killed , i was in my senior year in college			1
i did n't have a connection to military wives			0
" but @entity8 was not alone			0
since 2001 , the wars in @entity26 and @entity40 have left 2,829 women without husbands and 46 men without wives , according to a may 2011 report from the @entity45			1
" in the beginning after i lost @entity8 , i honestly wanted to die , " she said			0
" i wanted someone 21 to say , ' i got the knock on the door			0
i had the two men who said the words that shattered my world			0
and i am like you and trying to pick up the pieces			0
' " so she made it her mission to seek out other widows			1
she contacted a widow whose husband was killed alongside hers			1
" i gave her a call one day , and i said , ' i want to know all the things that people stopped asking me			0
i want to know how you met your husband			1
i want to know how you fell in love , how you were notified , and most importantly , i want to know what makes you get up every day and face life again , ' because i did n't know the answers			0
" @entity8 found other widows on @entity72 and used some of the $ 100,000 she received in military death benefits to buy video equipment			1
then she set out across the country to interview six widows in six different cities			1
" it was in the midst of filming that documentary that i got the idea of starting a nonprofit organization that would allow these women to have a place to share all the things that we basically were asking [ in the film ] , " she said			1
four months after @entity8 ' husband was killed , the @entity1 was born			1
since then , more than 750 widows have joined the organization			1
it started with the website -- a place for young widows to share their stories , learn from one another and find comfort in knowing they 're not alone			1
then @entity8 began organizing " getaway " trips so the widows could meet in person			1
the trips have ranged from skydiving out of planes to rebuilding a house damaged by @entity106 through the @entity107			1
@entity108 , a widow who helped rebuild the house in @entity110 , said it was hard to find other people who understood what she was going through			0
" after @entity114 died , i just felt like there was nothing that was going to give me any comfort , " @entity108 said			0
" i felt like nobody could understand that amount of loss of my best friend , my husband , my soul mate			1
" i did n't even think that these women could understand that			1
but i 've been fortunate to meet all of them			2
they 're dealing with so much of it , and they 're on a similar path			0
for me , it 's comforting			0
" @entity132 , who also lost her husband , agrees			2
" it 's opened my eyes to show me different ways on how to be able to handle things to where i feel like i 'm not alone , " she said			0
" it 's definitely helped me heal more			0
" for @entity8 , starting the organization has helped her just as much as it 's helping other young widows			2
" in the beginning , it was hard for me to even laugh or smile because i thought if people saw me laughing or smiling , they would think that i was over @entity8 , " she said			0
" in reality , i 've learned that when i 'm laughing and smiling and i feel most alive is when i feel my husband the most			2
" we 're all on different journeys			0
we all have different paths			0
but to come here on one of our getaways for at least three days and just feel united , feel the love of our husbands and feel the love of our new lives that we 're rebuilding together ... that 's the thing that gets me through it			0
