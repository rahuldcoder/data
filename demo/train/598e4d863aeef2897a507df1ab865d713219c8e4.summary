@entity0 , @entity1 -- i 've spoken to doctors in @entity0 before , but never one this optimistic			1
solar panels similar to these are bringing renewable and regular power to two clinics in @entity1			1
when i interviewed dr. @entity10 , he told me his clinic is offering new hope to their patients			1
not because of any new medicines housed inside			2
but because of the high tech equipment placed on the outside -- 64 solar panels to be precise			2
about 4 months ago , they were installed on the roof of the @entity20 , where dr. @entity10 works , as part of a project being underwritten by the @entity24 and supported by @entity1 's @entity25			1
only two other clinics in all of @entity1 have been given access to the same technology			1
dr. @entity10 excitedly explained its significance			0
" it means we can give our patients the care and medical aid they need , " he said , " and we can do it 24 hours a day			0
" round the clock medical care may not sound like anything special , but in @entity1 , where the power grid is unreliable and blackouts are frequent , most clinics can open only a few hours a day			1
and that 's not the worst of it			0
without dependable electricity , dr. @entity10 explained , certain medications ca n't be kept at the right temperatures			0
at one point , @entity50 even had to cancel their children 's vaccine program because the vaccinations could n't be stored properly			2
that all changed with the arrival of the panels -- for a few months at least			0
the clinic recently suffered a setback			2
before we visited , someone tampered with a key circuit board and that 's preventing the clinic from using electricity still being stored in the batteries			1
until it 's fixed , @entity50 is back to using what most other clinics must use , expensive and polluting diesel generators			0
but that has n't dampened dr. @entity10 's enthusiasm			0
he fully expects the solar panels will be powering the clinic again within a few days			1
as a doctor in @entity0 , he 's faced far worse , and he 's determined to overcome this challenge			0
more than anything , he simply wants to make sure his patients can get access to the best care possible .			0

@entity2 visited one of only three solar - powered clinics in whole of @entity1
despite setbacks , clinic doctor is optimistic clinic will benefit from solar
grid is unreliable , medicines can not be stored ; hopes solar will *eliminate* *problems*
