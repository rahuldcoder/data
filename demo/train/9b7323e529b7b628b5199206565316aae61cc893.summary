game on ! first up : @entity4 tensions @entity25 : @entity26 do n't get along too well under the best of circumstances			1
and right now , is not the best of circumstances			2
@entity30 is calling off trade with the @entity26 , closing off access to its waters for @entity4 ships , and setting up a new military plan with regard to the @entity26			2
all of this is in response to the sinking of a @entity30 warship in march			2
the @entity30 says @entity41 fired the torpedo that sank the ship			2
the @entity46 is involved here , too			1
president @entity47 ordered military commanders to work with @entity30 to prevent any aggression from the @entity26			2
secretary of state @entity50 is urging @entity41 to share what it might know about the sunken ship			2
@entity55 , the @entity46 and @entity30 just announced yesterday that they 're going to run a military exercise together as a direct response to the march incident			1

stopping the @entity63 @entity25 : tension on the rise in @entity65			1
frustration on the rise in the @entity46 over this oil spill in the @entity5			1
some of you have talked on our blog about your frustrations with the spill			2
according to a new @entity0 poll , 76 percent of @entity46 disapprove of how @entity74 handled the oil spill , and 51 percent of @entity46 disapprove of how president @entity47 has handled the spill			1
that brings up another question : who should be in charge of the cleanup efforts ? the government says it should be @entity74			1
since the company owns the well , the government argues that @entity74 is responsible for stopping the leak and for the cleanup			1
but @entity74 says the government has the ultimate control over the efforts in the @entity5			1
the one thing that both sides seem to agree on is that they 're frustrated -- like you , like all of us -- with the efforts so far			1
@entity93 , secretary of @entity46 @entity95 : i am angry and i am frustrated that @entity74 has been unable to stop this well from leaking and to stop the pollution from spreading			1
if we find that they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately			1
@entity105 , chief operating officer for exploration and production , @entity74 : i am probably just as frustrated as the secretary is			0
you know , we 've been at this every day for more than a month now , trying to get this flow stopped and actually trying to fight this thing offshore			0
so , what i would say is we 're doing everything we can			0
we 've got the brightest people , the best people , every resource available putting at it			0
and we 're going to stay at it , despite the frustration , despite the setbacks we have			1
we wo n't quit until we get this job done			0
i can promise you that			0

is this legit ? @entity142 , @entity14 : is this legit ? you lose consciousness whenever you get a concussion			0
not necessarily ! in fact , most people who 've had concussions did n't black out			0
@entity150 in @entity151 @entity25 : one thing that every concussion does have in common is that they all temporarily interfere with how your brain works			0
they can affect things like your memory , speech or reflexes			0
and anyone who 's had a concussion is more likely to have another one			1
most concussions are caused by a hit to the head			0
it 's part of the reason you hear so much about them so much in sports , especially contact sports like this one			1
a congressional committee is looking at the long - term impact of these head injuries and how to prevent them			0
it held a hearing on the issue yesterday			0
@entity182 , who played for 10 years in the @entity183 , says that the pressure of the pro game can sometimes work against concerns about concussions			1
@entity188 , @entity189 : there was always pressure to get back out on the field			0
there 's still no parameters in place on the sidelines that you can say , " ok , this guy has had this type of a hit			1
we 're going to keep him out for a certain amount of time			0
" @entity25 : the @entity183 is trying to tackle the issue of concussions , but it 's also pushing states to look at how younger players can be affected by concussions			1
one of the lawmakers who 's part of this hearing says it 's important for the pros to set an example			1
@entity217 @entity216 , ( @entity218 ) @entity219 : and what we 've seen with the @entity183 is , young kids in sports at all levels emulate their favorite players			0
and if the @entity183 is n't doing things correctly , it 's , you have very little chance that it will trickle down , you know , to youth sports like it should			1
so , the @entity183 really needs to take the lead and really highlight safety			0

@entity301 : even though not one of them can understand a word she 's saying ... @entity305 : one , two , three -- oh			1
@entity301 : ... or why in the first 15 minutes of a basketball camp , baskets are n't being shot ... @entity305 : we 're making the number eight around our legs			2

@entity359 : their joy , their excitement , just to watch them playing			0
they 're playing just like 5th and 6th graders play			0
it 's hard to believe , especially when you look behind them and they 're living in these tents and there is rubble from the earthquake			2
@entity374 : when they play , they forget about the awful earthquake that happened in @entity6			1
sport is very , very , very good for them to make them forget some things like the earthquake			0
it 's a good thing , you know ? ( @entity383 ) before we go @entity25 : it is indeed			2
