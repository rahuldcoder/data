-- during @entity3 's 2011 presidential election , when activists and poll workers tried to text criticisms of the incumbent or the evidence of polling fraud , they found their messages would n't go through			1
yet there was no problem sending innocuous messages about the weather or what they had for lunch			2
" so much of communication in @entity22 and many other continents and countries are dependent on mobile providers that could turn against you all of a sudden -- or could go down , " @entity18 told me in a recent phone interview			1
he is a man who is likely to change all that			2
in @entity3 's case , the government was monitoring text messages sent among activists and poll watchers			1
@entity18 said that was designed to censor dissent			2
the lessons : texts are n't always private and governments are pretty much always nosy			2
those are just a couple of reasons @entity18 's work with a new nonprofit called @entity43 , @entity44 for " guardian , " is so crucial to the future of free speech in the developing world			1
i like to think of @entity18 as the savior of the sim card , that humble piece of hardware that 's stuck in the back of your cell phone and helps it communicate with the network			1
that old school and overlooked piece of technology could help human rights advocates , protesters and relief workers communicate during a crisis -- both by serving as an encrypted tool for passing messages and , potentially , helping cell phones communicate with rogue network towers that go up when governments take down communications or natural disasters crumble the existing infrastructure			2
at a time when governments are getting savvier about using technology to stamp out free speech , these sorts of scrappy tech tools are needed more than ever			1
earlier this week , @entity80 released a " transparency report " saying government requests for its data increased 19 % during the second half of last year			2
@entity86 has called the rise in government censorship requests alarming			1
while some countries made gains in 2012 in terms of granting free expression , several , including @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 , lost points in a recent ranking from @entity98			1
@entity43 's efforts to fight censorship are the reason it 's part of my new @entity0 opinion column , which focuses on human rights and social justice issues			1
i 'm a former technology writer , so some columns will highlight technological innovation			2
others will focus on how people are using the @entity111 to create social change and on human rights crises that are n't making it into mainstream headlines			2
last year , i worked with the @entity116 to produce a story on slavery in @entity119			2
i 've also covered topics like @entity111 and gaming addiction in @entity122 and prisons in @entity124			2
soon , you will see me writing and fronting a project called @entity127			2
the pilot was on @entity129 , the state with the lowest voter turnout			0
i reported from there and enlisted people on the @entity111 to try to help move that state up " the @entity134			0
" not that i can take credit ( and not that it 's an insanely huge victory ) , but the state tied for 49th place in 2012 , instead of 50th			0
it 's not everything , but it 's progress			0
anyway , back to sim cards			1
other people also are catching on to @entity18 's concept , too			0
" in parts of the world where the @entity111 is either down or monitored , " @entity147 writes for the @entity148 , " @entity43 would give activists , human rights workers , and journalists the ability to communicate simply by swapping sims			1
" the blog @entity152 calls it a " handy lo - tech solution to fight censorship			1
" the @entity155 recently gave the nonprofit a $ 150,000 grant			1
in a sense , the already - old - news sim card could take on a new life as the technological grandchild of the fax machine , which helped activists in the @entity164 communicate with the broader world and each other ; or the cassette tape , which helped @entity169 radio hosts in @entity22 disseminate their broadcasts to townships			1
so the @entity172 is the new fax machine , but in a good way			0
if all of it sounds a little utopian , maybe it is			0
@entity18 is gambling that several systems fall into place to make these types of communication work - arounds possible			0
but he 's betting on the right technologies			0
there are 4.5 billion mobile phones in the developing world , according to data compiled by @entity187 , and many of them are " feature phones " -- not - so - smart devices that only make calls and send text messages			0
when crisis hits , the phone is the device people turn to first for help			0
@entity18 's work builds on that of other crisis - technology developers			0
and its first step is a tiny one : to create software that will make it easier for programmers to control and write to sim cards			1
that 's harder than it might sound , though , since the good - guy hackers have to use 1s and 0s , not elaborate code , to talk with the hardware sims			0
with a staff of three , @entity43 is working on open - source software , called @entity216 , to do just that			1
but the group is seeking volunteers to help			0
if you know anyone who is fluent in machine language , e-mail @entity18 at @entity224			0
from there , it could become possible for the @entity172 to communicate with rogue cell phone towers -- maybe 10 feet tall -- that could be set up in response to a humanitarian crisis like the @entity231 earthquake or a communications blackout like those seen in @entity234 , @entity235 or @entity236			0
those towers and the altered sim cards could make it possible for small groups of people to communicate over a network , @entity18 said			1
" the technology is there , " @entity18 told me			0
" the problem has been the phones people have ca n't talk to the towers			0
so this open source software we 're trying to build would allow you to essentially flash sim cards and distribute them to people			1
... at that point they could talk to whatever networks they want			0
" until then , the @entity216 could be used by activists to pass digital information to each other , often by hand			1
@entity262 , who works with journalists and activists in @entity265 as part of a group called @entity268 , said even that simple update " would definitely be something of interest " for journalists trying to evade government censorship			1
" the more offline we can get and the more creative we can get the better it is for us , " she said			0
" and everybody 's got a cell phone here			0
" election monitors in @entity265 also plan to use sim cards to record information about polling places and election - related violence , @entity18 said			1
they 'll pass them off to coordinators by hand , who then will take them to a place where the data can be uploaded to the @entity111			0
in a sense , that makes the sim card a substitute for paper			2
but , unlike paper , sim cards can be encrypted and stored discretely			1
they 're less likely to catch the eyes of authorities			0
" think of it like passing around a thumb drive , " he said			0
a thumb drive that costs about 25 - cents -- and does n't require a computer			0
which is why the sim card -- and other affordable , ubiquitous technologies -- is likely to make a comeback as a modern vehicle for free speech			1
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity313 .			1

@entity43 is creating software that could be used to hack sim cards
@entity313 : it will be a boon to activists and humanitarians
the nonprofit is one of many *tackling* censorship in the digital era
@entity313 : too many countries are using tech to crack down on free speech
