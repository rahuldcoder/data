@entity9 's impact : state by state " the cost is actually much worse for @entity24 airlines like @entity45 and @entity46 , because they have to pay for accommodation and meals for their customers who are stuck in the @entity4 -- particularly in @entity8			1
" @entity53 law says airlines have a " duty of care " to take care of stranded passengers			1
there is no such law governing @entity4 airlines			2
" @entity61 and @entity62 can just say , ' sorry , this is a weather event and you 're not covered , ' " @entity33 told @entity0			0
at least 50,000 travelers between the @entity35 and @entity4 have been affected by the storm , @entity33 estimates			2

" all the airlines have exceptionally sophisticated recovery programs , " he explained			0
" what they do is they do n't make the flight to the first place			0
they do n't send the aircraft into the bad areas , so they do n't get stranded			0
they 're now already starting to work out flights for wednesday , thursday and friday			0
you write off monday and tuesday , then you start to rebuild the schedule			0
" " after the [ @entity190 volcanic ] ash cloud two years ago , airlines were able to restore the schedule quite quickly , simply because people canceled their flights [ and did n't rebook ]			2
and that 's what the airlines are banking on			2
