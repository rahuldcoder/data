-- i promised myself that i would n't do it			1
i was n't going to jump in to the whole @entity4 circus			1
the seats were all taken			2
social media was in overdrive			2
and everyone 's been far too distracted			2
@entity11 , for one , was not about to enter the twerkosphere			2
but dang , it 's like a train wreck , is n't it ? candidly , i have n't been all that bad			1
but i have kept up to speed on many of the conversations taking place			2
shame on people who are shaming people			2
shame , shame , shame			2
but the one person who seems to have flown under the shame radar is @entity4 's partner in debauchery , @entity26			1
as a dad and husband in this story , it seems to me he should be held as accountable -- if not more -- for this ridiculous national spectacle and its aftermath as a 20 - year - old girl			1
let 's rewind : i actually saw the performance			1
our television -- which is usually on @entity41 -- was uncharacteristically tuned to @entity21 the other night so my 17 - year - old son and i could watch what we heard was going to be a pretty awesome @entity45 performance			1
well , we enjoyed the @entity46			2
and , yup , we also got more of @entity4 than we bargained for			1
outraged parents : why @entity4 ' performance sets girls and women back sure , from my middle - aged vantage point , it was gross , inappropriate , and downright offensive			1
but let 's be honest , so much of what our kids are exposed to is just that			0
and if you think otherwise , take an inventory of advertising , television shows , music lyrics , teen magazines , social media and virtually everything associated with the @entity66			0
i 'm not condoning or supporting it			0
but i do accept it as a reality			0
i 've also come to believe there are gray areas -- or to use @entity4 's performing partner , @entity26 's words , blurred lines -- in life			1
especially when we 're tempted to pass judgment on others			0
there 's especially a lot of those fuzzy areas with kids as they navigate their way to adulthood			0
maybe that 's why i 'm more forgiving and understanding of @entity4 than others			1
in my book , that still makes her a kid			0
i have two of my own around her age			0
to me , she 's just one of the gang			0
@entity4 upholds @entity96 tradition i 've spent a lot of time around teens and young adults in my life			1
and many of them make crazy mistakes along the way			0
they do things that they 'll regret			0
but , as best as i can tell , they usually turn out fine			0
my kids were glued to @entity4 's @entity112 years and i think she 's one incredibly talented person			1
even some of her new stuff is fine			0
is she going overboard with this apparent mission to prove she 's an adult ? seems so			0
but who i am to judge ? as a dad , i can only hope she finds her way through her own blurred lines and gets to the other side healthy			0
but i do believe there are other places in life where the lines are black and white			0
just like the stripes on mr. @entity26 's fun costume the other night			1
and , truthfully , i think he 's the one that crossed a line			0
it 's the line that says while we can have fun , men must know the difference between respect and disrespect when it comes to how we treat women			1
i find it ironic that so many people talk about how @entity4 will look back on all this with embarrassment in the future			1
i do n't know if that will ever happen			1
and i do n't know that i care			2
if @entity4 outrages you , do n't watch but i do care that mr. @entity26 ( who i also think is an awesome artist ) seems to have abdicated his responsibility ( as a man -- not a celebrity ) to model respectable behavior towards women			1
and i 'm guessing he 's a pretty dandy dad and husband			2
i mean , come on , his own father was @entity154 of " @entity154 " ! i 'm not an @entity21 producer , but i 'm pretty confident mr. @entity26 knew exactly how that performance was going to go down			1
foam fingers , package grabbing , twerking , @entity4 backing herself into his hips like he was an open garage door , and the rest of the mess			1
just like the rest of us			0
and we all owe it to our kids to act and show them where the blurred lines go away			2
and a special note to my 17 - year - old son : i know we both rolled our eyes the other night when we watched @entity4			1
it was pretty awkward to see her act that way			0
we all do dumb things and i hope you know i 'll always give you plenty of room to make mistakes and find your way to adulthood			0
as you can guess , i 'd appreciate it if you kept from anything involving twerking on national television			0
and please limit your use of foam fingers to sporting events			0
but if i ever see or hear of you crossing that very real line about how to treat a woman -- or any human being for that matter -- do n't expect such open - mindedness from me			1
there 's no such thing as a blurred line when it comes to respect			2
as your dad , i take that one very seriously .			0

her singing partner during the show , @entity26 , has n't faced as much *scrutiny*
fatherhood *writer* @entity207 says that as a man , @entity26 dropped the ball
@entity207 says as a husband , father and human @entity26 should have had more respect
