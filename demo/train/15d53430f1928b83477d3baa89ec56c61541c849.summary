@entity0 -- @entity3 's lawyer asked a jury to find @entity5 responsible for his death , not the concert promoter			1
attorney @entity8 spent four hours wednesday deliver his closing arguments in the trial of the wrongful death lawsuit brought by @entity5 's mother and three children			1
" plaintiffs want you to hold a concert promoter liable for @entity5 's overdose in his bedroom at night , behind locked doors on june 25 , 2009 , " @entity8 told jurors			1
" an overdose of the drug administered to mr. @entity5 by his longtime doctor -- dr. @entity24 -- who he 'd been seeing for years , a doctor he brought to @entity0 from @entity26			1
" when the trial began five months ago , @entity8 warned he would show " ugly stuff " and reveal @entity5 's " deepest , darkest secret			1
" the revelations that jurors heard from 58 witnesses over 83 days of testimony spanning 21 weeks included details of @entity5 's drug use and his shopping for a doctor to give him the surgical anesthetic propofol that he thought would give him sleep			1
" he was nearly half a billion dollars in debt , " @entity8 argued wednesday			0
" his mother 's house was near foreclosure , we did n't know that then			0
what else do we know now ? that mr. @entity5 spent decades shopping for doctors to give him the painkillers he wanted			1
mr. @entity5 made sure we did n't know that			1
" @entity49 , the lead lawyer for @entity5 's mother and three children , conceded in his closing tuesday that the singer may have some fault for his own death , but said " it 's about shared responsibility			1
" @entity5 did use prescription painkillers and was warned that using propofol at home to sleep was risky , " but he never had a problem until dr. @entity24 was working and until @entity24 negotiated with @entity3 , " @entity49 argued			2
the @entity3 lawyer , @entity8 , argued wednesday that @entity5 should take the full blame			1
" the sad truth is mr. @entity5 's death was caused by his choices and it would have happened no matter what -- with or without @entity3			1
" the @entity72 lawyer urged jurors to award the family between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion in damages for its share of liability in @entity5 's death -- to replace what he would have earned touring , had he lived , and for the personal suffering from the loss of a son and father			1
@entity8 told jurors wednesday that was " an absurd number			0
" @entity87 testified that she filed the wrongful death lawsuit three years ago against @entity3 " because i want to know what really happened to my son			2
" her lawyers argue that the company is liable in the death because it negligently hired , retained or supervised @entity24 , who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in @entity5 's propofol overdose death			1
@entity5 's lawyer will have another two hours thursday morning to sum up his arguments in rebuttal			1
twelve jurors , who have sat and listened in a @entity0 courtroom for 21 weeks , will then begin deliberations			0
the judge is allowing a television camera in court for the closing arguments and verdict			0
who 's to blame for @entity5 's death ? @entity3 's defense @entity24 treated @entity5 and his children for minor illnesses while they lived in @entity26 for three years , before the singer returned to @entity0 to prepare for his " @entity114 " comeback tour			1
it was @entity5 -- not @entity3 executives -- who chose @entity24 to be his full - time doctor for his tour , the company 's lawyers contend			1
@entity3 co-ceo @entity120 negotiated to pay @entity24 $ 150,000 a month only because of @entity5 's request to have his doctor with him as he performed 50 shows at @entity125 's @entity124 , they argue			1
" he told them ' we 're bringing this doctor , ' " @entity8 said			0
" this was a choice mr. @entity5 made , he was a grown man			1
" @entity3 executives tried to talk @entity5 out of taking an @entity133 doctor with him on tour , suggesting he could save money by using a physician in @entity125 , @entity8 said			2
" but mr. @entity5 was undeterred , " he said			2
" ultimately , it was his money , his doctor , his choice			0
he certainly was n't going to take ' no ' for an answer			0
" there was no need to check @entity24 's background because he was a licensed , successful doctor who was known to @entity5 , @entity8 said			2
" all @entity3 knew was dr. @entity24 was mr. @entity5 's longtime doctor			1
" a key argument in the @entity5 case is that @entity3 was negligent by not ordering a financial background check of @entity24 , which would have revealed he was in a dire financial situation and not successful			2
his desperation to keep his lucrative job led @entity24 to violate his @entity153 to do no harm by using the dangerous propofol infusions to put @entity5 to sleep each night for two months , @entity5 lawyers argue			0
@entity3 executives had no way of knowing @entity24 was treating @entity5 's insomnia with propofol in the privacy of his bedroom , their lawyers contend			1
@entity5 was a secretive addict , adept at keeping family , friends and other doctors in the dark about his medical treatments , they argue			0
but two doctors testified that they told @entity168 about @entity5 's abuse of painkillers and his insomnia during tours in the 1990s , when the @entity3 executive served as tour manager			1
@entity5 lawyers argue @entity168 , who was the top producer on the new tour , should have known that @entity5 could suffer the same problems in 2009			0
the deterioration of @entity5 's health over the two months he was being treated by @entity24 was a red flag that there was a problem , but @entity3 executives negligently ignored the warning , @entity5 lawyers argue			1
by june 19 , he was frail , suffering chills , unable to do his trademark dances and paranoid , according to testimony			0
" everyone believed at the time that a 50 - year - old man , who had n't performed in a decade was tired , out of shape and very nervous , " @entity8 argued wednesday			0
" that 's what they believed at the time and it makes sense			0
" @entity3 can avoid a negative verdict if is able able to convince at least 4 of 12 jurors that it did not hire @entity24			0
it is the first of 16 questions on the jury verdict form			0
if jurors answer it with a " no " -- that @entity3 did not hire the doctor -- they would end their deliberations and the trial			0
an @entity3 lawyer e-mailed an employment contract to @entity24 on the morning of june 24 , 2009			1
@entity24 signed it and faxed it back to the company that day			0
but the signature line for @entity3 's ceo and @entity5 were never signed since @entity5 died the next day			2
@entity8 will point to those blank signature lines as evidence that @entity24 was never hired by his client			0
there were negotiations with @entity24 , but he was never paid , the @entity3 lawyer argues			2
@entity49 , the lead @entity5 lawyer , told jurors tuesday that all the elements of an oral contract -- " just as valid as a written contract " -- were in place when @entity5 died			1
@entity24 had been treating @entity5 for two months and the written contract stated that his start day was may 1 , 2009			0
a series of e-mail exchanges involving @entity24 and @entity3 executives and lawyers supported his argument , @entity49 said			0
a look at the life of @entity5 blame and damages if the jury concludes @entity3 has liability , it would have to decide how much the company should pay in economic and personal damages to @entity5 's mother and children			1
they can use estimates of @entity5 's " lost earnings capacity " -- the amount of money he could reasonably be expected to have earned if he had lived -- to guide them			2
@entity3 expert @entity243 testified it was " speculative " that @entity5 would have even completed another tour because of his drug use , damaged reputation and history of failed projects			2
he suggested the star may never have earned another dime			0
@entity8 's closing argument about damages must overcome the impression left on jurors tuesday when @entity49 played a video montage of @entity5 performances			2
" that is , i think , the best evidence of if @entity5 could have sold tickets -- not what mr. @entity243 would tell you , " @entity49 told jurors			0
@entity49 suggested jurors pick a number between $ 900 million and $ 1.6 billion for economic damages			0
they should add on another $ 290 million for non-economic damages -- or personal damages , he said			0
@entity8 argued that the number , if the jury finds @entity3 liable , should be closer to $ 21 million , the amount of money @entity3 's expert calculated @entity5 would have given his mother and three children over the next 16 years			2
he could n't have given them more because he was had a $ 400 million debt that ws getting deeper , he said			0
" if mr. @entity5 had lived , it 's hard to see how he would ever have dug himself out of that whole , " @entity8 said			1
the last question on the verdict form asks jurors to assign a percentage that they believe represents @entity5 's share of blame in his death			1
the total damages owed by @entity3 would be reduced by that percentage			0
@entity49 will have two hours to rebut @entity290 's arguments before jury deliberations begin later thursday			0
@entity5 's mom remembers her ' sweet little boy '			2
