fandom is a tricky thing			0
people are willing to do some unusual and sometimes dangerous things because of their devotion for a team , player or entertainer			0
music fans often reach the height of fandom as they crush themselves to the front of the stage in an effort to get as close to the performers as possible			2
entertainment photographer @entity16 has been capturing the faces in the crowd for a few years now and likens their devotion to a battle scene			1
" the idea of the essay is to drive the audience into a war environment , " @entity16 said about his " @entity22 " project			2
" the shades of gray with a lot of contrast associated with the dramatic faces and the desperate acts of the crowd gave me the drama i wanted			0
" indeed , the images he captures depict the agony and frustration someone might feel in conflict			2
but amid the pain , there is also joy and excitement as music lovers get a taste of something most people at a concert do not			1
@entity16 's photographs from the @entity51 festival in @entity52 are up - close , personal and intimate			1
the festival is one of the largest music concerts in the world and has brought together some of the most popular acts of their time : @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and , more recently , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
it draws hundreds of thousands of fans from all over the world to see and hear their favorite acts			0
but for some people , it is the chance to show the performers how they feel about them			0
" i realized that people who stay at the first row in these situations do n't want just to listen to the music better or to see their idol closer , " @entity16 said			1
" they want to prove love to the person on the stage and to prove to themselves that they 're brave			0
" the 30 - year - old photographer , from @entity86 , @entity87 , said the crowds who press forward during the music festival is mostly younger and male			1
however , there is a woman he thinks is in her 60s who is ever - present at many of the venues and somehow makes her way to the first row			2
from @entity16 's photos , it might appear that the action on the stage is secondary to the rush in the crowd			1
@entity16 trains his camera on what he believes is the most unpredictable places to get the most emotional images at the events			1
" sometimes the artist behind the microphone just does n't move , the light does n't change and a few pictures already present what the gig was , " he said			0
" but the front row is always unpredictable ; it changes every time			1
people reaching their physical limit just to be as close as possible to their idol is much more interesting than the planned and controlled situation happening on the stage			0
" social media follow @ @entity122 on @entity123 to join the conversation about photography			0
the subjects of his lens have described themselves as proud to go through such pain for their musical adulation , and they proclaim " the front row is only for the real ones " on the @entity134 page of his projects			1
" people who face this situation until the end of the concert go home feeling they 've received an honor medal for being strong , " @entity16 said			2
" who wants to see the concert comfortably from an empty space ? " while he 's never seen a serious injury from his position in the pit , the space between the stage and the crowd , @entity16 hopes his photos do justice to the level of emotions portrayed in the name of fandom			1
he thinks the people in the front row believe they answer to a higher calling			1
" the aim of this work is to show the power of fanaticism , " he said			0
" i wanted to show how a rock concert can be similar to a religion cult , where sometimes people submit themselves to suffering just to prove their love to their idol			0
" @entity16 is a @entity87 photographer based in @entity86			2
