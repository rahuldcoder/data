-- it started with the denial of a growing health crisis			2
nearly 40 % of @entity5 's children are overweight or obese -- the second - highest rate in the nation -- yet 50 % of @entity8 do n't consider child obesity a problem			1
what 's more , 75 % of parents of obese children do n't think they have a problem on their hands , according to @entity16 of @entity17 , the state 's largest pediatric health care system			1
in response , @entity16 crafted an ad campaign intended to highlight the roles of parents and caregivers in the widening epidemic			1
the posters and tv spots of obese children with doleful eyes were as stark as their accompanying messages : " being fat takes the fun out of being a kid , " and " it 's hard to be a little girl if you 're not , " to name a few			2
" we felt that because there was so much denial that we needed to make people aware that this is a medical crisis , " chief administrative officer @entity36 said			2
" we knew flowery ads do n't get people 's attention			1
we wanted to come up with something arresting and hard - hitting to grab people			2
" the buzz began almost as soon as the ads started appearing in september on billboards , buses and train platforms around @entity17			1
critics felt images from the @entity56 campaign were too negative and perpetuated weight - based stereotypes without providing concrete solutions			1
" there seems to be this perception that it 's ok to shame children and families struggling with obesity because that will provide an incentive to lose weight , " said @entity59 , director of research and weight stigma initiatives at the @entity62 at @entity63			1
" however , research in weight bias shows that when individuals feel shamed or stigmatized because of weight they 're actually more likely to engage in behaviors that reinforce obesity : unhealthy eating , avoidance of physical activity , increased caloric intake			1
" the tv spots stopped airing in @entity5 in october and most of the billboards have come down			2
but conversations around the campaign continued online and in media coverage worldwide , raising debate over what makes an ad effective when it comes to combating obesity			1
mommy bloggers take on anti-obesity ads as far as @entity16 is concerned , the fact that the ads sparked debate means they achieved their goal , regardless of the reaction			1
" our intention was to get people talking about childhood obesity and we did that			1
we ca n't do this alone ; it 's going to take a whole community of physicians , parents and caregivers to solve the problem , " @entity36 said			1
" if parents continue to be in denial we 're not going to get past this crisis			1
" it 's a crisis that has been fostered by a culture of convenience : fast food , calorie - dense meals and car - centric cities slowly building up to national obesity rates of 33.8 % among adults and 17 % in children , according to the @entity121			1
@entity122 realizes now that she was one of those parents who did n't recognize her daughter had a real problem			1
" it 's just a phase ; she 'll grow out of it , " she told herself			0
" i think i should 've been more proactive earlier on , " the @entity17 mother said			0
" i just did n't want to have a conversation that would upset her or put a rift between us , also because i knew that would mean me having to face my own issues with weight			0
" then , @entity138 saw an ad on @entity140 in february 2011 looking for overweight children			0
she asked her 13 - year - old daughter , @entity143 , if she was interested and at the audition , the two learned about the substance of the ads. they also heard about the potential backlash they could face if she accepted the part			0
" i was a little bit hesitant but then when i thought about it , i was like well it 'll be a good message to other kids like me , " @entity143 said			1
what 's the message ? " being overweight is a problem , but you 're not the only one dealing with it , " she said			0
feedback from her peers has been positive , she said -- most were surprised to see her on tv and billboards			0
she also became involved in the media blitz defending the ads , appearing on local news and the @entity166			1
through the experience , @entity143 and her mother were offered the chance to utilize the hospital 's @entity171 clinic , where she developed small changes to her daily routine through consultations with doctors , psychologists , nutritionists and exercise physiologists			2
and , she 's sticking with it , she and mother attested			0
fruits are surprisingly filling , she said			0
she ca n't remember the last time she drank soda after giving up sugary beverages for water and the occasional packet of sugar - free drink mix. she typically exercises at least 30 minutes a day , either by walking the dog with her mom or going to the park or playing on the @entity192 her younger brother			0
by the time school began last fall , she was ready to try out for the cheerleading squad and made it , which means two training sessions a week along with two to three games			0
" the smaller things definitely make a change , " she said in a phone interview sunday as she and her mother drove to a " @entity205 " event in @entity204 , @entity5			2
" it 's very hilly in my neighborhood but now when i walk the dog i do n't get as tired			0
with cheerleading , we have to run a mile at least			0
and before i could n't do the whole thing but now i can			0
" @entity143 came to the campaign as a paid model , but the hospital considers her an example of how @entity56 helps children set goals for a healthy lifestyle , complete with videos documenting their journeys			1
she 's not the only one , according to the hospital			2
the @entity225 had 350 patient visits in 2010 and nearly 600 patient visits in 2011 , with physicians treating more than 100 children with fatty liver disease and / or cirrhosis , conditions that are rarely seen among children who are not overweight			0
the multi-disciplinary approach is widely regarded as an effective tool in helping families make small changes in their daily routine			0
but among critics , those tools were buried far too deep within the initial ad campaign			2
" the stark settings , their forlorn looks and body language convey an image of kids who are alone and do n't have the support of the community			0
they teach us that we should feel sorry for fat kids and that it 's normal to tease and abuse them , " said @entity248 , author of " @entity249 : @entity255 and the @entity256 in @entity257			0
" " the approach should be to try to change those ideas with positive messages that encourage kids , parents and the community to get involved in encouraging kids to be active and eat well , " said @entity258 , a professor of @entity260 studies and @entity261 at @entity262			1
in recent weeks , critics of @entity56 's ads have compared them to a new campaign encouraging @entity274 to cut their portion sizes			1
the @entity277 's posters also employ austere black - and - white scenes of obese people , but the messaging is more direct			0
one poster shows a man with his leg amputated below his knee , crutches leaning against the wall , with the message " portions have grown : so has type 2 diabetes , which can lead to amputations			0
" still , the poster is generating controversy for a different reason , after the @entity293 revealed that the image had been digitally altered to remove the man 's leg			0
" this issue is n't about one actor , but rather the 700,000 @entity274 who struggle with diabetes , which kills 1,700 people a year and causes amputations in another 3,000 , " @entity277 spokesman @entity297 said in a statement to the paper			0
" advertising to warn the public about health concerns saves lives , and we will continue our efforts to warn @entity274 about diabetes			0
" the hard - hitting tone of @entity16 's ads were inspired by @entity316 's " not even once " campaign , along with other state - led campaigns against smoking and drug abuse , which tend to pair a minimalist aesthetic with brutal , straightforward wording			2
with smoking and drug abuse , the main targets of public health initiatives are users			0
but campaigns to combat obesity , especially childhood obesity , set their sights on those struggling with their weight , caregivers and the community -- essentially , society at large			2
" the target is everyone , whether they 're fat or not , that somehow we should all be taking responsibility for what 's perceived as an epidemic , " said @entity258			2
" the stigma itself needs to be addressed itself because until we do that , why would a fat child want to go out on the playground and be teased ? we want to create an environment where people are not treated so poorly because of their bodies that they 'll want go out and enjoy physical movement			2
" it 's a sentiment that representatives from @entity16 agree with , one that they say moves the discussion beyond an ad campaign to a movement that fosters healthier lifestyles			0
that means training pediatricians and health care providers on how to talk about obesity with families ; it means giving families the tools to start making steps toward positive change			1
" if you look at steps it takes to initiate long - term change , the first thing you need is to be aware that there 's a problem and then you need the intent to change , " said dr. @entity370 , the hospital 's chief surgeon and professor - in - chief of pediatric surgery at @entity374 in @entity17			1
" the first phase of the ad campaign was about raising awareness and generating the intent to change			1
now , it 's becoming a movement , where we move on to changing the culture that has created this epidemic			1

ads meant to raise awareness among parents of child obesity epidemic , hospital says
@entity56 ads being phased out but debate lingers over whether they did more harm than good
critics say they reinforced negative stereotypes , failed to provide solutions
hospital wants focus to shift from ads to steps that will change culture
