-- @entity1 may help @entity4 - area sheriff 's deputies find a suspect in a 20 - year - old killing after a comparison with genealogy records connected a crime - scene sample to a 17th - century @entity11 family			1
the dna sample was taken in the death of 16 - year - old @entity14 , who was killed on her high school campus in @entity16 , @entity17 , in december 1991			1
the @entity18 has circulated two composite sketches of a possible suspect -- a man in his 20s at the time with shoulder - length blonde or light brown hair -- but had been unable to put a name to the sketch			2
in december , though , the department sent the dna profile to @entity31 - based forensic consultant @entity30			1
@entity30 compared the profile to others in genealogy databases and found the closest match was to the family of @entity37 , who settled in @entity38 , @entity11 , in 1630 and had relatives who came over before him on the @entity40			2
while the descendents of @entity37 are likely to number in the thousands after nearly 400 years , geography and physical characteristics can help detectives narrow their search , @entity30 said			0
in fact , @entity30 said , since the @entity1 trace follows male descendants , there was " a high degree of probability " that the man police are looking is named @entity37			2
" the most important thing is having a last name , " @entity30 told @entity0			1
" people get excited about having a @entity40 connection , but the most important thing is having a probable last name for this guy			1
" @entity61 investigators disclosed the test results monday			0
@entity30 said the dna she used came from one of several major collections of genetic profiles , a practice she said was " really hot these days for genealogy			0
" she said the people who donated dna profiles to the database had either done their genealogy or had their dna tested to trace their connections			0
" it allows you to connect with relatives you ca n't trace through traditional documentation , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity77 contributed to this report .			0

@entity80 was killed in december 1991
a dna sample matches descendants of a 17th - century @entity11 family
" the most important thing is having a last name , " the @entity1 *analyst* says
