editor 's note : @entity2 , @entity3 , author of the book , " this business of @entity10 , " is a sports and entertainment lawyer whose firm , @entity6 , is based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
@entity11 says the evidence shows @entity13 was addicted to drugs			1
( @entity15 ) -- @entity13 died of an overdose , according to the preliminary finding of the @entity19 coroner described in court documents			1
the @entity13 apparently was given a variety of drugs that included the powerful sedative propofol , according to authorities			1
the news came as a shock to some			0
but the reality it pointed to was this : @entity13 was an addict			1
a drug addict is a person who has become physiologically or psychologically dependent on a habit - forming substance or drug			0
i operate a halfway house and we deal with this struggle regularly with our men , who have become addicts , and they continually tell me how hard it is to overcome			0
they also tell me that people are vulnerable to addiction whether white or black , rich or poor : drugs do n't discriminate			2
i am also an entertainment lawyer who understands the pressures of working in the music industry and the experience of insomnia that @entity13 apparently complained about over the years			2
and , of course , like millions of others , i am a huge @entity13 fan and i own all the records and cds and had the jacket ( from the " @entity55 " video )			1
and , i can sympathize with his sad life , legal problems , personal struggles , family issues and financial meltdown			0
but , while i sing his songs regularly and imitate his dance moves , when the laughter and joy stops , it hurts me to admit the reality : @entity13 was a drug addict who did n't need to be the center of another musical tour , but needed to be the star patient at a treatment center			1
for years , we have heard reports of @entity13 being addicted to painkillers and other things			2
however , in our society , we tend to overlook that when it 's a big name celebrity or someone we love in our circle of family and friends			2
celebrities drop in and out of rehabilitation centers and drug abuse facilities nationwide			0
and , their lives go on and it 's merely a passing footnote on the tv ticker running across the bottom of the screen			0
with @entity13 's tragic death at the young age of 50 , hopefully some folks will wake up			1
the @entity96 reports that in the year prior to being surveyed in 2006 , 560,000 @entity97 age 12 and older abused heroin at least once ; more than 16 million @entity97 took prescription pain reliever , tranquilizer , stimulant , or sedative for nonmedical purposes ; 6 million abused cocaine in any form ; and 1.5 million abused crack			0
in the case of @entity13 , there is a lot of finger pointing at @entity112 and several other doctors , who may or may not be charged			2
but , while we mourn the @entity117 legend and the tragedy of his life and death , it is important to note that this sad story sheds light on a much bigger problem in @entity97 : drug abuse			0
author @entity126 , a friend of @entity13 , has been telling us for weeks now on national tv outlets that @entity13 had a drug problem			2
" dr. @entity112 is the one who is going to be blamed because he injected the drug , but from what i 've learned he did not prescribe the drug , " @entity126 told @entity15 in reminding investigators to look deeper and further than dr. @entity112			0
like @entity126 , i hope investigators will go deeper , but i hope we will go deeper as a society			0
@entity13 sold hundreds of millions of records , including the top selling album of all time , " @entity140			2
" with his death , we can reach and teach billions of the dangers of drug use			0
unfortunately , he joins a long list of major artists who have seen superstar careers end by the mortal reality that drug addiction can kill you			1
it hurts us to talk about @entity13 's drug addiction or drug problems , as it hurts us to look at a near - century of great artists struggling with drug issues and in some cases dying at the hands of drugs -- from jazz legend @entity160 's drug problem to @entity162 's overdose to singer @entity164 's death from anti-depressants			1
@entity167 's death brought to public light his prescription drug addiction			1
and , we saw in recent years @entity172 's heroin - induced suicide death , and the 2004 death of @entity174 , who wrote " @entity176 , " from a drug - related heart attack			0
too often these stories do n't prompt substantial national outrage and we fail to break the stereotypical picture of what we think of when we hear the words " drug addict			0
" police and prosecutors are still mum on whether @entity13 's death will result in criminal charges			1
it is not clear who is at fault			0
but no one is disputing that @entity13 asked for these drugs repeatedly over the years , like most drug addicts , and had a sickness that afflicts millions of other @entity97			1
so , let the legal system play out , but let 's stop avoiding what hurts the most , so we can save millions of other drug addicts from this horrible nightmare and other families from the pain the @entity201 will now live with forever			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 , @entity3			0

@entity205 : coroner 's preliminary finding shows @entity13 died of an overdose
he says he 's one of @entity13 's many millions of fans
he says it 's painful to admit @entity13 was addicted to drugs
@entity2 : let 's stop avoiding the reality of drug addiction in our society
