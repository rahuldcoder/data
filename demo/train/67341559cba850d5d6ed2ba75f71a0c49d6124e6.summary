-- once thought to be a leading reformer inside the @entity4 government , @entity1 has emerged as one of his father 's most - visible defenders			1
@entity1 , 38 , has never lived a day in which his father @entity8 did n't rule @entity4 -- as its undisputed leader inside the country and an enigmatic , controversial voice for the world			1
and yet , as the @entity4 government faced a stiff popular uprising , it was @entity18 's second eldest son -- and not the @entity19 himself -- who was first to talk to the nation about the unrest and detail a plan to address it			1
in early @entity1 made it known his feeling about outside intervention into the unrest in @entity4			1
" we 're not afraid of the @entity30 fleet , @entity31 , @entity32			0
you people , this is our country			0
we live here , we die here			0
we will never , ever surrender to those terrorists			0
@entity4 nation is so united now			2
we are so strong , " he said			0
and still , @entity1 's name makes front - page news			1
citing unnamed @entity47 government sources , the @entity45 newspaper reported friday that a senior adviser to @entity1 -- @entity49 -- was in @entity50 for secret talks with @entity47 officials			1
@entity49 told @entity0 earlier this week that he would be traveling to @entity50 for family reasons			2
calls placed to his mobile phone were not answered friday			0
but @entity56 , a leader of the @entity4 opposition , said @entity49 's visit was anything but personal			1
" our sources from @entity62 tell us that @entity1 has sent @entity49 to @entity50 with a specific offer			2
the offer is that colonel @entity1 will go into retirement , inside @entity4 , perhaps in his town of @entity68 or @entity69 in the south and @entity1 will take over and oversee some sort of reforms , " he told @entity0 's @entity64			1
asked about the @entity45 report , a @entity75 spokesman neither confirmed nor denied it			0
" we are not going to provide running commentary on our contacts with @entity4 officials , " the spokesman said			0
" in any contact that we do have , we make it clear that @entity1 has to go			0
" meanwhile , sources close to @entity1 have told @entity0 that any transition in @entity4 would involve his son , @entity1 , who has long been seen as a possible successor to his father			1
@entity1 has denied any such desire , but others were interested in the idea for some time because he was considered more modern in his thinking , even reform minded by many @entity4 watchers			1
but that was before his recent and very public vows to fight to the " last bullet			0
" among his relatives , @entity1 was seen in some ways as the polar opposite of his father			2
whereas @entity18 years ago launched a program to " destroy imported ideologies , whether they are eastern or @entity101 , " his son speaks fluent @entity102 , earned his phd from the @entity104 , written an op - ed in the @entity106 and has been a frequent go - between in talks with international officials			0
@entity8 rarely goes anywhere without a distinctive tribal dress and an ornate @entity113 tent			0
the well - traveled @entity1 , meanwhile , is more likely to appear in western business attire : a suit and tie			2
while the father runs a nation , his son 's main job -- at least before his 2009 appointment as general coordinator , a position like many in the nation 's government with few guidelines -- was heading a charity , the @entity129			0
and lastly , while the elder @entity1 is known for his heavy - handed rule in @entity4 and its restrictions on civil rights and more , @entity130 fashioned himself as a human rights advocate and pushed for democratic and institutional reforms that could give more power and freedoms to the people			1
@entity139 , a professor at @entity104 and @entity130 's academic advisor , said @entity1 knew he had a dilemma			2
" he was torn , " said @entity139			0
" there was a dilemma in his heart between loyalty to his father and the regime and on the other hand desperately realizng that the @entity1 regime was untenable , unjustified and the reform utterly crucial			2
" still , his status as a leading reformer and pull with foreign diplomats have dropped significantly since the start of the uprising			1
and for all their differences , @entity1 's standing in the world is largely defined by his father 's role			1
while some may see the son as more open to change , there 's little question that his loyalty remains first with @entity8			0
" he 's the heir apparent , " @entity0 national security contributor @entity167 said about @entity1			1
" the question will be , will he be able to retain control in light of the current chaos ? " @entity0 's @entity173 contributed to this report .			2
