-- @entity1 said a lot of great things			1
but after his death , he 's being widely credited on social media with a phrase he did n't utter			1
amid the deluge of tributes to @entity12 's first black president , who died thursday aged 95 , many @entity8 users were paying homage to @entity1 by posting the following quote : " our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate			1
our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure			0
" they attributed the words to @entity1 , but as the @entity20 reported more than two years ago , the words actually come from a bestselling book by self - help author and spiritual teacher @entity23			1
the misattribution to @entity1 was already well established in 2011 , the @entity20 says , and how he came to be given credit for the quote " remains a mystery			1
" his death has now prompted a revival in the mistaken citation			1
despite efforts to dispel the confusion , tweets linking @entity1 to the quote were still chugging along at a steady rate early friday , blending in with the array of memorable phrases he really said			1
@entity37 angered by fake tweet @entity1 's death also sparked a more malicious type of misquoting			1
a @entity8 account under the name @ @entity44 posted a tweet purporting to be from @entity37 in which she appeared to misattribute the rev. @entity48 's " @entity50 " speech to @entity1			1
but @entity51 later fired back angrily , tweeting , " whoever made that stupid fake tweet lacks respect to the loss the world is mourning right now			2
same goes for all the blogs who ran with it			0
" her real tribute to @entity1 ? " he was a true hero & the world is a better place because of him			2
may he rest in peace			0
" by early friday , the @ @entity44 account appeared to be inactive			0
@entity69 of public and historical figures are nothing new			0
in 1989 , two academics published " they never said it : a @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			0
" in the extended exercise in debunking , @entity76 and @entity77 attempted to put paid to misleading myths that had grown up around words linked in the popular consciousness to people like @entity84 and @entity85			0
' mangled to meme ' but since then , the @entity87 has dramatically increased the velocity at which such falsities spread			0
after the killing of @entity93 in may 2011 , words incorrectly attributed to @entity48 and @entity91 quickly snowballed on social media			0
the phrases were being used by people to express discomfort with celebrations of @entity93 's death			1
in an online inquest into what happened with the mistaken @entity48 quote , @entity103 of the @entity104 remarked that " the speed of dissemination is breathtaking : mangled to meme in less than two days			0
" she also noted the resilience of false quotes			2
" fake quotations are pithier , more dramatic , more on point , than the things people usually say in real life , " she wrote			2
" it 's not surprising that they are often the survivors of the evolutionary battle for mindshare			0
" some people are using the @entity87 to try to fight back against rampant misattributions to major figures			0
the website fakebuddhaquotes.com says it 's dedicated to sorting true from false , around 2,500 years after the @entity124 's time on earth			2
those who would like to keep @entity1 's real remarks separate from the fake ones have a long road ahead .			1
