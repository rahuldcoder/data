attorney general @entity0 has been bruised and battered by @entity1 who made him the first - ever sitting @entity3 member to be held in contempt of @entity5			1
he 's been knocked around in behind - the - scenes @entity7 battles with some of president @entity10 's top advisers			1
but more than 1,700 days after being the first black man sworn in as attorney general , @entity0 has defied expectations that he was on his way out			1
and he 's planning on staying for a while longer			0
sources close to the attorney general say he plans to stay in office until well into 2014 , at the president 's behest			1
he 's changed his mind before			0
this past summer , he and the president spent time together during their vacation at @entity22			0
@entity0 was considering leaving later this year , and the president asked him to stay as long as he could , sources said			2
@entity0 : new strategies needed for ' active shooter ' situations these days , @entity0 appears to be more at ease in the job			0
last week , he went toe - to - toe with @entity30 , chief of @entity31 , taking a hard line on the bank 's tentative $ 13 billion mortgage securities settlement			0
at recent news conferences , the attorney general has even invited additional questions from reporters			2
not long ago , @entity0 's battles with @entity1 and even with @entity10 's top lieutenants fueled years of speculation about how long he would remain on the job			1
the attorney general attracted @entity1 criticism early on after the president handed him the job of leading legal efforts to close the @entity48 prison at @entity49 , @entity50			1
weeks after taking office in february 2009 , @entity0 tangled with @entity52 , who was then @entity7 chief of staff , over comments @entity0 made suggesting the need to revive the assault weapons ban , according to people familiar with the matter			1
@entity52 was angry that @entity0 's gun control comments could provide fodder for opponents of the president 's legislative agenda			1
by 2010 , @entity52 succeeded in getting tighter @entity7 control of @entity0 's public statements amid disagreement between the two men on how to deal with terrorism trials in @entity69 of the accused 9/11 plotters			1
in the meantime , @entity0 had to contend with efforts by other @entity7 advisers , including @entity74 and homeland security secretary @entity75 , to rein in his public role on the administration 's behalf			2
many of @entity0 's troubles with @entity7 officials were detailed in a book by journalist @entity83			1
a series of challenges @entity86 , who was a top aide to @entity0 during some of those early troubles , says being tasked with the @entity49 review began a series of challenges for @entity0 that became compounded with the 2009 christmas day underwear bomber case			0
then the scandal over the botched gun sting called @entity95 and more than a year of congressional investigations and hearings added to the attorney general 's problems			1
" even he would say that in the first few years , he was unable to focus on the things he wanted to do as attorney general , " @entity86 said			2
@entity95 , in which agents with the @entity103 allowed suspected smugglers to buy about 2,000 firearms , squandered much of @entity0 's tenure			1
amid congressional hearings and @entity1 calls for his resignation , the attorney general assumed a more low - key public presence			1
source : @entity48 to allow @entity103 agent to write ' @entity95 ' book it was n't until september 2012 , after a @entity116 inspector general probe cleared @entity0 of wrongdoing in @entity95 , that he began to emerge , giving media interviews and doing major speeches			2
by that time , @entity5 had held @entity0 in contempt in a fight over documents related to the gun sting			1
back on his feet in recent months , @entity0 appears to have regained his footing			0
he has spent recent months focusing on efforts to remove mandatory - minimum sentences for some nonviolent drug offenses and boosting the department 's efforts to enforce the @entity131 after the @entity132 struck down a key component of the law			0
he 's also trying to complete some big financial crisis cases			0
@entity116 sues @entity136 over voting law he 's even managed to find a few republicans to support some of his initiatives			0
rep. @entity140 of @entity141 is working to try to rescue the civil rights law			0
sens. @entity143 of @entity144 and @entity145 of @entity146 are working to put into law some changes @entity0 is making on mandatory - minimum sentences			2
@entity86 says the difference has been that @entity0 is now focusing on matters he cares about			0
" and you 're seeing the results , " @entity86 says			0
he still takes fire , as he did this summer for targeting journalists in aggressive leak investigations			0
he announced some changes in the way prosecutors pursue such cases that appear to have quelled the outcry			0
one of @entity0 's harshest critics , @entity163 @entity162 rep. @entity162 , chairman of the @entity164 , has n't been quieted by @entity0 's attempts to turn the page			2
in a june appearance on @entity169 's " @entity168 , " at the time of the controversy over @entity0 's testimony to @entity5 about the leak investigations , @entity162 said : " it 's hard to have confidence in what this attorney general says -- or his people say -- when so often it turns out not to be true			1
" @entity0 seeks to cut mandatory minimum drug sentences			0

attorney general @entity0 has tangled with @entity1 , @entity10 advisers
@entity0 was held in contempt of @entity5 over the " @entity95 " gun sting
