-- researchers from @entity2 to local nonprofits have tried for decades to count the @entity5 ' gay , lesbian and bisexual population , and still , there were no hard numbers			2
but for the first time , the decennial census results report counts of same - sex partners and same - sex spouses , regardless of whether same - sex marriage is legal in their states			1
headlines from across the country reveal common themes : there are more people who identify as gay , and they 've dispersed to more places			2
in @entity27 , " number of gay couples ... rises sharply			2
" in @entity29 , " family makeup is changing			0
" in @entity31 , " same - sex households up 77 %			1
" in @entity33 , @entity34 : " @entity5 's @entity32			2
" the @entity35 has been releasing the state data since june , along with information about how many children are being raised in same - sex parent households			1
national figures will be released in november			0
state numbers reveal about a 50 % increase in same - sex couples since 2000 , with some of the biggest increases in traditionally conservative parts of the country , said demographer @entity47 of @entity48 's @entity48 , a think tank dedicated to sexual orientation and gender - related law and public policy			1
the increase is n't because of a surge of gay people coupling in the last decade , @entity47 said			0
rather , growing social acceptance of homosexuality has led to a greater willingness to report it			0
some states with the greatest proportion of same - sex couples -- @entity60 , @entity34 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 -- are among those that issue marriage licenses to same - sex couples or allow civil unions			1
other trends are emerging , too			0
what do @entity33 ; @entity70 , @entity71 ; and @entity72 , @entity63 , have in common ? they 're vacation or retirement destinations known for having strong ties to the @entity78 population , and the data shows some of the highest concentrations of same - sex couples			1
" what may be happening is this idea that baby boomers were the first generation to really have a visible @entity78 community , and of course , they 're starting to retire now , " he said			0
the numbers also show the proportion of same - sex couples raising children has n't changed much since 2000 , he said , despite increasing numbers of adoptions			1
@entity97 ' explanation : fewer couples are raising children from previous heterosexual relationships			2
" that form of parenting is on the decline , " he said			0
" with greater social acceptance , people are coming out earlier in life and they 're less likely to have children			0
" so why count gay couples and their children at all ? the numbers and correlations could be used to develop policies about same - sex marriage or partner benefits , advocacy groups say			1
" it 's hard to advocate for a group of people when you ca n't say with certainty how many of them are in our communities , " said @entity117 , chief legislative counsel for @entity118 , the nation 's largest @entity78 advocacy group			2
" this helps us better quantify the economic harm to same - sex couples and how many people are affected by decisions to deny them the rights and benefits of marriage , especially those associated with federal law			1
" but some argue the census did n't go far enough to collect data on the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender population			0
no question in the 2010 census asked " are you lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender ? " and no results share the total number of @entity78 people in the @entity5			1
rather , the census counted people of the same sex who live together and checked the boxes for " husband and wife " or " unmarried partner			2
" the results are based on how people identify themselves , even if they live in states where same - sex marriages are n't legally recognized			1
the 2000 census provided the first opportunity for same - sex couples who described themselves as husbands or wives to be counted as same - sex couples			1
but those responses were ultimately counted as unmarried partners , because marriage for same - sex couples was n't legal in any states then			1
@entity177 mayor @entity176 officiates same - sex wedding when the census counted only those who live with a spouse or partner , it left out the majority of gay people in the @entity5 , said @entity186 , president of @entity187 and former @entity189 special assistant and senior adviser to president @entity191			1
" any data is better than no data , so i think there is some data that might be helpful for researchers and statisticians , " @entity186 said			0
" but from a political perspective , until they agree to count the @entity78 community in its entirety , i 'm not going to be satisfied			0
" @entity186 acknowledged that the census does n't specifically enumerate heterosexuals , but argues that population is n't wrapped in a polarized debate about rights			0
" the country is involved in a very important policy debate about extending rights and responsibilities to gay @entity5 and in the context of that debate , it is important to know how many people we 're talking about , " he said			0
others have attempted to estimate -- not count -- the country 's @entity78 population , but any count can be hampered by survey methodology and willingness to respond			2
the @entity48 estimated that more than 8 million adults in the @entity5 are lesbian , gay , or bisexual , and nearly 700,000 are transgender			0
a study released in april suggested that nearly 9 million @entity5 , about the population of @entity27 , identify as @entity78			0
@entity48 research has also found that about 50,000 same - sex couples have married , based on administrative data on the number of couples who have legally married in @entity34 , @entity232 , @entity31 , @entity60 and @entity233			1
another 85,000 same - sex couples have entered into civil unions or domestic partnerships in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity27 , @entity62 , @entity233 , @entity237 and @entity238 , according to the @entity48			1
the census results are just one table on a long , long spreadsheet , but demographers and advocacy groups said it 's a significant change			2
" the fact that the census is very publicly beginning to acknowledge the need for this kind of data , that 's a big deal , " @entity47 said			2
" those who work to expand civil rights and legal protections for same - sex couples say having some sort of baseline count helps their efforts			1
" before the census count , some nonprofits conducted their own counts of the @entity78 populations in their communities			1
the @entity264 of @entity265 , @entity71 , launched its own web - based survey in 2009 with the goal of assessing the needs of the " lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender and questioning " community			0
" the count " asks basic demographic questions -- race , ethnicity and age -- but also tries to take the pulse of the community and identify problems			0
one question asks whether ageism , elitism , sexual addiction or lack of leadership are serious problems			0
others ask respondents about violence or harassment based on sexual orientation , about health and whether their relationships are " nurturing and supportive			0

the number of same - sex couples is on the rise , and they live in more places
2010 census was first to count same - sex marriages in states where it 's not legal
@entity237 , @entity60 , @entity34 show highest proportion of same - sex couples living together
