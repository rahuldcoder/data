how can architecture help a nation cope with traumatic history ? a @entity4 institute designed by @entity5 attempts to find a new answer to the question			1
due for construction in 2015 , the @entity8 , designed by @entity9 - winning @entity5 , will be a landmark genocide memorial for @entity4 , breaking away from stereotypes of commemorative architecture			1
it has been nearly 35 years since the fall of the @entity16 , a regime that slaughtered two million @entity4 , but the scars are yet to fade			1
" we believe that this project is one step in moving beyond memorial , to reconciliation and healing , it will be truly transformative , " @entity5 tells @entity18			2
uplifting architecture from renderings of @entity5 's design , we can see five majestic towers rising out of the surrounding forest like beautiful mutant trees			1
raised on stilts for protection from floods , the floating buildings evoke a serenity associated with religious sanctuaries			0
the design is a far cry from the dark designs of other famed genocide memorials such as @entity41 's @entity40 of @entity42 , a stark and imposing display of concrete and steel			1
" the building design seeks to commemorate the past with moments of somberness , reflection and tranquility , but it was extremely important that the institute also evoke hope and optimism for the future , and the design includes moments of warmth , light and inspiration , " says @entity5			2
the choice of @entity5 was crucial for the institute 's visionary founder @entity61			2
himself a survivor of the @entity16 - led genocide , @entity61 hopes that the institute can move away from the " heavily angular , quasi-industrial , and distress - invoking architecture " of the many other memorial models			1
his vision for the institute — and for @entity4 's future — is one that honors the past while directing the audience towards a positive , future - oriented experience			1
building the future situated in @entity73 , the institute will become the permanent home of the largest collection of genocide - related material in @entity77 — up to a million documents archived by the @entity79 of @entity4 , an ngo run by @entity61			1
the institute 's name is also inspired by the act of documentation			0
" @entity8 " means " the power of leaves " referring to the dried leaves that @entity4 intellectuals used to discreetly document and disseminate knowledge and culture during periods of oppression			2
but the institute 's more significant role will be in educating future generations through its graduate school program , to prevent repeating the tragedies of the past			0
" people will learn about what happened so that they can liberate themselves from being a victim and get ready to compete for success in the future , " says @entity61			0
local inspiration @entity105 is also notable as one of @entity5 's first major projects that uses wood as a prominent material			0
" @entity110 receives and transfers light in a particularly warm way			0
this quality of light and shadow within a wood - structured building is something that we felt appropriate and akin to the very qualities we strove to achieve in the design , " says @entity5			2
the first female architect to win the coveted @entity122 , @entity5 is known for her dramatic , futuristic monuments of fragmented geometry and curvilinear form			0
@entity105 brings forth a softer , warmer , and perhaps more feminine side of the architect 's imagination , taking inspiration from a lesser known @entity4 temple , the @entity131 , also known as the " @entity132 , " some 30 kilometers north of @entity133			1
" one of the remarkable things about @entity4 's traditional temples is the way that intricate and beautiful forms are built up from simple geometric elements			1
we have taken a parallel approach in the design to define a progression of interconnected spaces within the institute , " says @entity5			0
femininity is an important factor for this commemorative structure as women constitute a major portion of the survivors of the @entity16 period			0
according to @entity61 , women struggled to raise the next generation on their own and have been instrumental in rebuilding @entity4 society , " but they have had too little voice " throughout the country 's tragic past			0
cheeky medieval doodles show ancestors just as silly as us how did this human face appear in a gemstone ? is this the end of ambitious @entity167 architecture ? a peek inside @entity169 , @entity171 's most prestigious photo fair			0
