-- for most of @entity5 history , the average farmer , shop owner or entrepreneur could live an entire life without getting anything from the federal government except mail service			1
but those days have gone the way of the @entity11			0
last year , the @entity12 reported that 49 % of the population lives in a household where at least one person gets some type of government benefit			2
the @entity19 's annual @entity18 on @entity20 tracks government spending and creates a weighted score adjusted for inflation of federal programs that contribute to dependency			1
it reports that in 2010 , 67.3 million @entity5 received either @entity27 , @entity28 , support for higher education or other assistance once considered to be the responsibility of individuals , families , neighborhoods , churches , and other civil society institutions -- an 8 % increase from the year before			1
these people are n't necessarily dependent on government ; many could live ( even live well ) without their @entity28 check , @entity44 grant or crop subsidy			0
that 's not the point			0
the problem is that @entity49 is building a culture of dependency , with ever - more people relying on an ever - growing federal government to give them cash or benefits			1
this is a growing and dangerous trend			0
the @entity5 thrives because of a culture of opportunity that encourages work and disdains relying on handouts			1
the growth of the welfare state , a confusing alphabet soup of programs that are supposed to help low - income @entity5 make ends meet and do not include entitlements such as @entity28 or @entity69 , is turning us into a land where many expect , and see no stigma attached to , drawing regular financial support from the federal government			1
opinion : @entity5 are not moochers consider means - tested social welfare programs			1
the federal government operates at least 69 programs that provide assistance deliberately and exclusively to poor and lower - income people			2
the benefits include cash , food , housing , medical care and social services			0
yet when poverty expert @entity89 , senior research fellow at the @entity19 , examined these anti-poverty programs , he found that only two , the earned income tax credit and the additional child refundable credit , require recipients to actually work for their benefits			1
it had been three , but earlier this year , the @entity98 administration effectively set aside the most well - known welfare work requirements , those specifically written into the 1996 @entity27 law			2
the @entity101 announced that states could apply for a waiver of the law 's clearly stated work requirements			0
meanwhile , although spending on welfare has been cut in half since it was reformed in 1996 , other federal spending on programs , such as food stamps , has soared year after year and decade after decade			2
simply put , spending on social welfare programs has exploded			1
@entity114 : the poor do have jobs under a culture of dependency , poverty becomes a trap , and recipients get stuck			1
long - term welfare recipients lose work habits and job skills and miss out on the marketplace contacts that lead to job opportunities			1
that 's a key reason the government should require welfare recipients to work as much as they can			1
what could be called " workfare " thus tends to increase long - term earnings among potential recipients			0
another problem is that we simply ca n't afford all this spending			0
the national debt is at $ 16 trillion , more than the entire gdp of the @entity5 last year			2
high as it is , that debt is about to soar			0
more than 78 million baby boomers are retiring onto @entity28 and @entity69 in the next 15 years or so			0
under @entity143 , @entity142 is set to explode as well			0
within just one generation , total federal spending could reach nearly 36 % of @entity138 , and the @entity146 says debt held by the public could reach nearly 200 % of gdp			0
that will crowd out virtually all other government spending , including national defense			0
future congresses could impose deep cuts in social welfare programs across the board or raise massive taxes to support these exploding programs			1
the results would be chaotic and unpredictable			0
news : @entity161 remarks : plain truth or huge mistake ? it does n't have to be this way			0
we can reduce dependency on government and focus benefits on those who are truly needy			2
for example , by including work requirements and promoting marriage ( being raised in a married family significantly reduces a child 's chances of being in poverty ) , we 'll help rekindle the @entity178 for everyone			2
all poverty programs should be reviewed to make certain they 're helping people instead of harming them			1
social welfare programs should help people up , not hold them down			1
join the conversation on @entity187			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			2
