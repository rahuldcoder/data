@entity0 , @entity1 -- more than 37 million people visit @entity0 each year for its glitz , glamour and lure of hitting a jackpot			1
yet few tourists ever see the dingy world beneath the bright lights : tunnel dwellings that have become home to those down on their luck			2
@entity16 and his girlfriend , @entity17 , live in the depths below the @entity19			1
they created an elaborate 400 - square - foot space , complete with a living room , bedroom , kitchen and workshop to fix bicycles			2
everything is elevated off the floor with wooden pallets or milk crates because of potential flooding			2
their prized possession is a queen - sized bed , found in a dumpster near the @entity37			2
" i like to be able to come back and sleep as comfortably as possible , " @entity16 said , patting his bed			2
by day , he scrounges for change above ground			2
he 's been living down below for two years			2
he lost his construction job because of an addiction to speed and heroin			2
the couple is not alone in the city 's tunnels			2
" hundreds of people live in these tunnels , " says journalist @entity47			1
@entity47 has become an expert on the more than 300 miles of underground flood channels and its tunnel dwellers			1
@entity47 brought the homeless to light , first in articles for the alternative weekly newspaper , @entity58 , and then in a book titled " beneath the @entity60 : @entity61 in the @entity62 of @entity0			1
" @entity47 noted the irony of one tunnel entrance near the famous " @entity65 " neon sign			1
" i just think the history of @entity68 is to ignore the bad issues , " he said			1
" the instinct of the city -- and the county -- is to ignore stuff that can be construed as negative press and kind of highlight other things about the city			2
" the number of those living in the storm drains varies by the season , @entity47 said			1
the tunnels become damp and cold in the winter , but hundreds flock into them during the summer to escape the 100 - degree desert temperatures			0
" it 's much cooler than outside , about 20 - 25 degrees cooler , and that 's one reason why someone would live or hang out in these tunnels , " @entity47 said			1
armed with a black metal flashlight , @entity47 took @entity2 on a tour of four tunnels			1
each tunnel was different ; their heights ranged from 4 to 12 feet			0
some intersected underground ; others had small openings to access parallel tunnels			0
it was pitch black much of the time			0
" after you 've done it a few hundred times like i have , you can walk down here without any light at all , " said tunnel dweller @entity16			0
@entity47 said he 's always " a little bit on edge " when he climbs into the underground world			1
" you never know what to expect or what you 're going to find down here , " he said			0
if legend is to be believed , a troll armed with a crowbar combs the tunnels			0
even if it 's not true , @entity47 said , it still haunts him			1
" a lot of the people ... have their own ghost stories about a friend who was murdered in the tunnels or someone who drowned and they hear their voices late at night , " @entity47 said			1
" it is true that you do hear some weird noises down here because of the acoustics			0
" some of the channel floors are covered with dust , others mud , and , in one section , a foot of stagnant water			0
there are sleeping bags and mattresses , some with makeshift canopies , but they seemed outnumbered by the trash , scraps of food , cockroaches and graffiti			0
upon hearing our footsteps , some vagrants scattered from their makeshift shelters , not knowing if we were marauders or the police who sometimes come through to chase the homeless out			2
@entity47 introduced us to a man known in these parts as " iron , " who has lived in the flood channel system for six years			1
@entity157 had sun - baked skin and wore a cap reading " jackpot ! " the recovering alcoholic said he makes ends meet receiving tips for pumping gas or cleaning windshields at a nearby service station			1
he lives near the entrance of a tunnel across the highway from the @entity173 and @entity174 hotel - casinos			0
" you 'd be surprised at night the view you have right here , " @entity157 said			1
" people pay a lot of money in the suites to have views of the @entity19			1
i get it every night for free			2
" he sleeps about 10 feet from the entrance of a four - foot high tunnel			0
it does n't rain often			0
but when it does , the floodwaters carry away anything in its path			0
" i live pretty simple now after replacing things for six years			0
" over in another vegas flood channel , a homeless man named @entity197 sat with his bags packed ready to leave his tunnel dwelling , about 200 feet from the entrance			1
the 52 - year - old said police came through two days earlier encouraging people to leave			0
he sat on a mattress wearing khaki pants and a short - sleeve collared shirt			0
he said crack cocaine abuse led him on a dark path into the storm drains			1
he 's hoping to leave soon			0
" after 30 years of wasting time and money , 30 years of drug use , i want my life back , " he said			0
" i want to get up and lead a productive life again			0
" to that end , @entity47 is helping			1
that was one of his goals when he began his journey -- to find a way to help the tunnel dwellers			0
he became partners with the charitable outreach organization help of @entity1 to form the " @entity226 " foundation			0
@entity47 escorts social workers into the storm drains twice a month to offer assistance to the homeless			1
they provide blankets , food , water and counseling			0
according to @entity47 , more than a dozen people who were living within the tunnels received housing in the past six months thanks to the partnership			1
but @entity47 said he thinks @entity241 could do much more to help			1
" i 've always thought more should be done , " he said			0
@entity157 , the homeless man with a city view , believes the city tolerates the tunnel dwellers because " we 're not hurting anybody			1
" " the only thing getting hurt down here is ourselves and nobody else			2
" @entity2 's @entity250 contributed to this report .			0

homeless *population* of @entity0 turn to storm drains for shelter
" i just think the history of @entity68 is to ignore the bad issues , " @entity47 says
one man *nicknamed* " @entity157 " says the best thing is his view of @entity19 at night
