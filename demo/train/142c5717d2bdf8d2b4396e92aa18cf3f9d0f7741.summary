-- one year ago , @entity2 gunmen in @entity3 boarded a school van and shot @entity5 , then 15 , for speaking out for girls ' education			1
@entity5 survived the tragedy , and her courageous story of a teenage girl who would not be silenced inspired tens of millions more in the fight for girls ' rights			1
as @entity5 said in july during her historic address at the @entity15 , " i raise up my voice -- not so that i can shout , but so that those without a voice can be heard			1
" and as the world marks @entity21 on friday , it is worth remembering all those young girls , the same age as @entity5 and some even younger , whose voices go unheard : the millions of child brides around the world robbed of their youth and their rights , including the chance at education			1
the world will never know the talent it loses to early forced marriages			0
most of the world 's child brides reside in @entity5 's home region of @entity38			1
in her native @entity3 , almost one - fourth of the country 's girls find themselves in unions or marriages by age 18			1
@entity44 , @entity3 's neighbor to the east , has more child brides than any other country in the world , with 47 % of all of the country 's more than 600 million girls married before their 18th birthday			1
in @entity54 , 66 % of girls end up becoming child brides , the third - highest rate in the world			2
the tradition of child marriage , reinforced by poverty , instability and a lack of resources , has proven hard to fight even in this era of globalization			0
education has proven to be one of the most potent weapons in the fight against child marriage			0
according to @entity70 , a global partnership to end child marriage , a girl who receives seven or more years of schooling will marry an average of four years later			0
in @entity78 , around 60 % of girls without an education are married by 18 , compared with 10 % who complete secondary schooling			1
that number drops to nearly zero for those who are able to reach higher education			2
when a girl can become a student instead of a bride , her family benefits			0
a study in @entity3 measuring returns on education showed that extending a girl 's schooling by one year led to a 13 % to 18 % increase in her wages			1
data from a @entity97 study put that number at up to 20 %			0
a baby born to a literate mother is 50 % more likely to live past the age of 5			0
and child vaccination rates quadruple when mothers are educated			2
when girls become brides , on the other hand , schooling is often not an option			0
even if husbands and their families permit the girl to go to school , the immediate push to have children makes girls much more likely to drop out			1
pregnancy is the leading cause of death worldwide for girls ages 15 to 19			0
child brides have precious few paths to earning an income and to contributing to their family 's economic health , leaving girls ensnared in a vicious cycle of poverty			2
domestic violence and @entity129 transmission also increase dramatically when girls marry at a young age , further threatening both the girls and the well - being of their children			1
for every @entity5 you meet there are many more whose stories will never be known -- girls robbed of their chance to pursue their dreams and to go to school simply because they are girls			2
that is not just their loss ; it is ours			0
girls are a precious natural resource			0
and we do n't have talent to waste			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			2

@entity153 : @entity3 student @entity5 raised her voice for girls ' education
@entity151 says girls in @entity38 are married as children at high rate and are denied an education
she says educated girls make more money , their babies live *longer* , their families benefit
@entity151 : if married early , girls have higher *mortality* , @entity129 rates and poverty
