-- the big winners of this @entity3 season could be road drivers rather than @entity3 racers , according to one former world champion			1
@entity7 , who took the drivers ' title in 1979 , hopes a raft of technological changes -- notably smaller , hybrid engines that promise greater fuel efficiency -- will help improve road cars ' performance			1
" it 's very positive for the sport , this is the first time you 've seen the sport bring in regulations that really push the envelope of technology for every type of car , " the @entity16 told @entity0			1
" they are trying to take efficiency from everywhere they can on a car			0
" this year 's race cars will boast an enhanced @entity32 ( @entity32 ) and 1.6 - liter @entity34 engines , compared to the 2.4 - liter @entity35 on show last year			1
the @entity32 uses heat generated when braking and thermal energy from exhaust gases to create extra power			0
the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) has been used in @entity3 since 2009 , but @entity7 says these latest advancements in the sport will only benefit everyday drivers			1
" wherever there is heat , they turn that into energy , " added the former @entity50 driver			0
" from that point of view , that 's what road cars are becoming more and more			1
" they 've taken this energy from the brakes and these different areas , that 's what @entity3 has done to a much higher degree than i 've ever seen before			2
i think the technology will flow to road cars very quickly			1
" it 's very important for the global environment that they can make the technology work practically and then it can move into road cars			1
" on the track , @entity7 expects an unpredictable start to the championship as teams and drivers wrestle with the new regulations			2
an encouraging preseason for @entity79 has fueled talk that @entity81 is the favorite for this weekend 's @entity84 @entity83 and in pole position to take the title			2
@entity81 , a world champion in 2008 , set the fastest time on the final day of the final test event in @entity88 , but the quickest lap time of preseason was set by @entity91 of @entity92			0
the @entity93 is a new arrival at the @entity96 team following nine years with @entity50 and @entity7 expects @entity91 and @entity81 to start well , but he stopped short of tipping either to be top of the pile at the end of the season			1
" if you 're going to follow some of the test results then you have to think that @entity79 and @entity92 have got an advantage at the beginning , " he said			0
" how long it will take for other teams to catch up , who knows ? " i would 've thought after the fourth , fifth race , you might see things settle down			0
someone could make a modification and gain one second , two seconds per lap. that is a massive amount			0
so until things settle down i would n't want to back anybody			0
" the climax of the 2014 season is set to be a dramatic one , with double points set to be awarded to the driver who takes the checkered flag at november 's @entity121 , with the winner of that race awarded 50 points , rather than the usual 25			1
it 's a move that @entity7 thinks will see the fight for the world championship go down to the wire			2
" what they are trying to do is make it so the last race determines the championship , " he said			0
" if somebody is quite far ahead and it looks like he 's going to win the championship ... if he does n't finish and another guy does he wins			0
" is that fair ? no it 's not , but it makes exciting racing			0
or it makes you throw something at the tv ! " interactive : 10 cars that changed @entity3			2

the first race of the 2014 @entity3 season takes place in @entity84 on *sunday*
turbo engines are back in the sport , with each car boasting a 1.6 - liter @entity34 hybrid
former @entity3 winner @entity7 expects @entity3 technology to *trickle* down to road cars
