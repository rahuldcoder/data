-- the @entity2 footballer who achieved global infamy on saturday after celebrating a goal with a fascist salute has been barred by his club until the end of the season			1
having already been issued with a life ban from the @entity2 national team for his actions in the 2 - 1 league win over @entity15 , @entity9 has now been sanctioned by @entity16 as well			1
the move follows widespread criticism of the 20 - year - old 's behavior , with many commentators expressing disbelief at the player 's claim that he was ignorant of the full meaning of his actions			1
in a statement , @entity16 confirmed rumors that the club future of the onetime @entity2 under - 19 captain is now in serious question			1
" the board has decided to suspend @entity9 until the end of the 2012 - 13 season , taking into consideration the horrific image his behavior provoked and has imposed the highest possible fine according to internal regulations , " the club said			2
" whether he continues or not at the club will be decided in the summer after giving him the chance to prove his behavior was the result of immaturity and after assessing whether his re-introduction into the side will be possible without creating shockwaves to @entity16			0
" a section of @entity16 's support -- influential fan group @entity53 -- has already said that it wishes to see @entity9 expelled from the club			1
champions on 11 occasions prior to a recent slump caused , in part , by enormous debts , @entity16 has long been proud of its reputation as a club with a left - wing feel			0
it was founded in 1924 by @entity2 refugees from @entity64 ( now @entity65 ) -- with @entity16 standing for @entity66 of @entity64 in @entity67 -- following the @entity68			2
an example of the club 's political leanings came when @entity16 played a friendly in @entity73 against local side @entity74 in april 1999 , a fortnight into @entity77 's bombing campaign of @entity78 , in a show of solidarity			2
given this background , not to mention @entity83 's detested wartime occupation of @entity2 and the recent rise of neo-fascist political party @entity85 , @entity9 has since admitted the " stupidity " of his actions			2
his club ban follows on from a statement he gave on sunday , in which he asked to be dropped from the first team because of the way in which he had " offended the history " of @entity16			0
his announcement came shortly after a man who steered @entity2 to the @entity102 under - 19 championship final in 2012 learned of his lifetime ban from the senior national team by the @entity105			1
" i made the mistake so i will be the one to pay for it -- @entity16 is not responsible , " @entity9 ' statement read			0
" so that is why i have decided to put myself out of the team because i have now realized how much i have offended the history of the club			0
" i sincerely apologize to my team mates and everyone involved with the club that i insulted in not knowing exactly what i had done in my celebration			0
nonetheless , the fact that i did not know what i was doing is no excuse			0
" the sentiment was shared by many around the world and particularly in @entity2 , where the midfielder 's actions came on the very weekend that marked the 70th anniversary of @entity129 deportations to @entity83 concentration camps			0
although his 84th minute goal helped lift troubled @entity16 four points clear from the relegation zone , @entity9 will play no further role in the remaining two months of the season as the traditional giants of the @entity2 game try to avoid the first relegation in their long history .			1

midfielder , 20 , has already been handed life ban from national team by @entity2 *federation*
