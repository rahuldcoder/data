-- the opening ceremony of the @entity2 was unforgettable -- not so much for the color and performers that enlivened @entity6 's national stadium , more for the unexpected events that unfolded in front of the watching @entity10 president			0
with @entity6 's team side nicknamed the @entity13 , @entity11 watched a rag of horses dance across a naked pitch as an unfortunate local traipsed behind them , using his hands and a cardboard box to clear the dung falling on a surface that would be staging an international match just moments later			0
the scenario was one that could have endangered any player 's well - being but very little was made of it -- for this was a tournament where things have been , and always will be , a little different			0
in years gone by , a variety of bizarre incidents have often fed the western media 's desire to pour scorn on an ever improving tournament -- as accusations of witchcraft have overshadowed matches ( see @entity39 vs. @entity40 in 2000 ) , players have been sent off for assaulting medical staff and organizers have taken to painting bald turf green to make pitches look better on television			1
that is not to mention the wild defending , tackling and haircuts that have long decorated @entity50 's biggest sporting event in years gone by nor , more seriously , the terrible gun attack on the @entity53 team bus that killed two delegation members in @entity55 two years ago			2
somewhat unusually though , the 2012 finals will be remembered for all the right reasons -- namely , the fairytale triumph of unfancied @entity57 in @entity58 , a land where 18 members of the national team had died in a 1993 plane crash			0
@entity65 motivation on sunday , the line up for the next tournament will be complete once 15 teams successfully negotiate a variety of tense playoffs and join hosts @entity50 in the finals			1
@entity75 managers will again warm their larynges prior to their habitual howl about the event taking place in the middle of the @entity82 season -- but for once , the timing of the next tournament really is key			0
for the decision by the @entity84 to move the @entity85 to an odd - ending year means it will end its reign as the only continental championship to stage its final just four months before the @entity65			1
given that the last @entity85 to take place in an odd year pre-dated the 1966 @entity65 , which @entity50 boycotted in protest at its meagre allocation of half a qualifying berth given they were required to face an @entity96 country in a playoff , the decision to move the biennial tournament is long overdue			1
the primary reason was of course to assist @entity50 's teams at the @entity65 , with a variety of players , coaches and conditioning experts having long opined that it is near impossible for international footballers to peak -- both physically and performance wise -- at two major tournaments so close together			2
then there was the issue of how poor @entity85 displays by @entity65 bound sides could lead to the firing of coaches with just weeks to go before football 's greatest showpiece got underway , as has happened repeatedly down the years			1
however , @entity50 's continuing failure to triumph at a @entity65 lay at the heart of the decision , with the continent having never reached the semifinals -- gallingly failing to emulate @entity96 's breakthrough when hosting in 2002 despite the last finals taking place on @entity126 soil			1
yes , @entity127 , @entity40 and @entity128 may have all reached the last eight ( in 1990 , 2002 and 2010 respectively ) but a more revealing statistic is that no @entity65 has ever found more than one @entity126 side in the knock - out stages			1
this is despite the @entity126 tally having gone up to two in 1982 , increased to three in 1994 before reaching today 's tally of five in 1998 -- while @entity50 's @entity65 staging allowed for a record six @entity126 teams in 2010			1
the @entity50 will once again host in january , when the 29th @entity85 will kick off just 11 months after the 28th			0
the restricted time limit - in a year when @entity50 's road to the @entity140 also began - has led to a heavily condensed qualifying campaign , with the usual league format replaced by two rounds of knock out playoffs			0
full stadiums the draw has meant that one of two big @entity126 sides will not qualify since @entity150 's @entity149 , beaten finalists in february , are taking on the @entity40 of @entity152 and @entity153 , with the visitors taking a 4 - 2 lead to @entity156 this weekend			1
other absorbing ties include @entity127 's home clash with @entity159 , with the four time champions currently trailing the islanders 2 - 0 and celebrated striker @entity162 an injury doubt , while @entity57 are by no means guaranteed to defend their title at the championship since they take a narrow 1 - 0 first leg lead to @entity168			0
after @entity50 took over the 2013 finals from war ravaged @entity171 , the country 's chief @entity85 organizer declared " priority number one is full stadiums , full stadiums , full stadiums " , with low attendances having often blighted previous tournaments			2
now @entity180 may be awash with international tourists in january , a month when the sun is at its height , and boast a stadium that hosted a @entity65 semifinal but the city will have no @entity85 role to play -- with matches taking place in @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 instead			1
when the latter venue attracted just 7,500 fans for a @entity50 @entity65 qualifier earlier this year , extra ammunition was given to those who argue that the ruling @entity200 government overlooked @entity180 simply because it is run by their bitter political rivals -- the @entity201			0
it is not the only area where @entity50 falls down , for the country 's captain , @entity204 , quit international football this month to concentrate on his club career with @entity208 -- a real kick in the teeth for both the tournament and @entity50 fans whose struggling team have failed to qualify for the last two @entity214			2
@entity50 won the competition when they last staged it in 1996 but crowds were pitifully low , despite the presence of continental legends like @entity221 's @entity220 -- the only @entity126 to have ever been crowned @entity222 -- and @entity224 greats @entity225 and @entity226			2
after hosting the @entity65 , @entity50 organizers frequently claimed that their football would never be the same again but local fans need to come out in force in three months ' time if substance is to be added to comments which should not seem so fanciful			0
yet the real impact of the @entity235 will take place long after the event -- as @entity126 teams walk out at the @entity140 in @entity239 , with lighter legs and a theory to prove .			0

line up for @entity126 football 's showpiece event , the @entity246 , to be determined by sunday
@entity85 has moved from even to odd years in a bid to avoid clashing with @entity65
tournament *accounts* for roughly 75 *%* of @entity84 's revenue
only one of @entity126 *giants* @entity149 and @entity40 can qualify
