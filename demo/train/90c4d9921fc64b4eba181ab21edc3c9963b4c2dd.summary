-- it was early evening when @entity2 got in his car to make the trip home from a meeting for work			2
he 'd done the trip many times over the years , and he looked forward to the drive			2
several hours later he found himself in open farmland in unfamiliar territory			2
he pulled over , brought out a book of maps , and realized he 'd driven two hours past the turnoff to his home in @entity16 , @entity17			2
" it was terrifying , " he remembers now			2
" i thought , i did n't mean to come here			2
how did this happen ? i just zoned out			1
" but he was n't just zoning out			2
a visit to the @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23 , showed @entity24 was in the beginning stages of alzheimer 's disease , a form of dementia			1
" that car ride was a real wake - up call , " he says			2
after his trip to @entity21 , @entity24 's wife insisted he get a professional driving evaluation to make sure he was safe to drive			1
his driving was fine -- the only problem was that he might wander off again down the road			1
it has been five years since that fateful car trip			2
the disease forced @entity24 , an @entity40 veteran , to retire from his position as president and ceo of the @entity44 of @entity45			2
now 64 , he does n't want to sit home all the time , and still drives and walks around			1
to decrease the chance he 'll wander again , @entity24 writes down exactly where he 's going so he can refer to it later , and he wears an @entity51 bracelet with a 24 - hour emergency response number			1
he has n't had another wandering incident , but knows he might at some point as his disease progresses			1
" i forget things i never used to forget and i know it 's only going to get worse , " he says			1
november is @entity58 and @entity59			1
about 60 % of the nation 's 5 million @entity61 's patients will wander , according to @entity63 , senior director of constituent services at the @entity65			1
" this is such a big worry for families , " she says			0
" we tell them their loved ones can wander off at any time , even when you just go into the kitchen for a minute to start dinner			1
" @entity63 advises families that there 's no way to keep an eye on someone 24 - 7 , but that there are some steps they can take to decrease the chances their loved one will wander			1
keep wandering top of mind sometimes families are surprised when their loved one wanders			1
@entity86 , an @entity61 's expert , has noticed sometimes families forget that wandering is a huge risk because they 're so overwhelmed with other aspects of alzheimer 's disease			1
that can be a fatal mistake			0
" families are worried their loved one will leave the stove on in the kitchen , or they 're annoyed when their loved one asks the same question over and over again , " he says			0
" @entity97 is n't always their major concern			0
pick up on the red flags of wandering wandering can happen at any time , but it 's more likely in certain situations , such as when someone with dementia is in unfamiliar surroundings			1
people with @entity61 's and other forms of dementia often leave clues that they 're about to wander			1
if your loved one says , " it 's time to go to work , " she might truly be headed out the door in a few minutes			1
" i want to go home " might mean he 's about to go in search of his childhood home , and you have to stop him			1
distract them do n't say " @entity124 , you have n't worked in 30 years , " or " @entity125 , you 're already at home			0
" reasoning wo n't work			0
" if they say they want to go to work , tell them ' ok let 's go see if we can find your shoes , ' " @entity86 suggests			1
" by the time they get their shoes on they 'll have forgotten about going to work			1
block ( or disguise ) the exits for safety reasons , you should never lock or trap a person with dementia in a home alone			0
if someone is there with them you can block the doors			0
there also are screens you can buy that look like , say , library books , so your loved one wo n't realize it 's in front of a door			1
you can also put a lock toward the bottom of the door ; @entity63 says people with dementia wo n't think to look for a lock in such an unusual place			0
another idea : put a mirror or a stop sign on the door , or you can try putting a dark rug in front of the door			0
people with late - stage dementia might think it 's a hole and wo n't go near it			1
label your rooms sometimes people with dementia will go wandering off in search of the bathroom or a glass of water and get distracted and actually leave the house			1
the @entity21 suggests putting a picture of a toilet on the door to the bathroom or food on the door to the kitchen , so they can more easily find what they need			0
keep them busy " sometimes people wander out of boredom , or because no one 's paying attention to them , " @entity63 says			1
" spending a lot of time watching tv is n't good			2
have them wash dishes with you , or fold clothes			0
" you can also enroll your loved one in an adult day care program so they 'll have interesting activities			0
@entity207 and @entity208 have search tools for finding a program near you			0
take a walk " have them take a walk or exercise with you , " @entity86 suggests			0
" they may be so tired afterwards they 'll want to sit for a while			0
" even if they 're not tired , the social engagement of the walk might be enough to keep them from wandering in search of company			2
provide safe wandering create a path through the rooms of your house as a place for your loved one to wander , or a circular trail through a fenced backyard , the @entity21 advises			1
consider technology some devices alert you if a door is open in the house			0
others tell you if your loved one has wandered beyond a certain area			0
you can even attach a gps to your loved one and then go online to find him on a map ; the gps might be on a bracelet or in a shoe			0
the @entity65 has an overview of electronic devices that can help keep track of @entity61 's patients , and the association also has information about the @entity254 and other safety products it sells			1
@entity256 has a partial listing of companies that sell safety products			0
these devices can be expensive and some have a monthly service fee			0
find the right facility many families are n't sure they can safely keep their loved one with dementia at home			0
the @entity65 has a guide to determining what kind of care you need , and a guide for finding nursing homes and assisted living facilities			0
@entity86 recommends you check out a facility to see whether it has any complaints against it , especially those that involve wandering			2
the @entity280 has a list of state ombudsmans ' offices , which can help you find the complaints			0
be sure to ask the right questions			0
" is the door monitored , either electronically or by staff ? " @entity86 says			0
" do they have electronic devices to keep track of people who wander ? and ask about their strategy for what they do if someone does wander off			2
" @entity296 and @entity297 contributed to this report .			0
