@entity0 -- the @entity2 apologized friday for a 1946 - 1948 research study in which people in @entity5 were intentionally infected with sexually transmitted diseases			1
a statement by secretary of state @entity8 and secretary of health and human services secretary @entity9 called the action " reprehensible			1
" " we deeply regret that it happened , and we apologize to all the individuals who were affected by such abhorrent research practices , " the joint statement said			1
" the conduct exhibited during the study does not represent the values of the @entity2 , or our commitment to human dignity and great respect for the people of @entity5			1
" president @entity24 called his @entity5 counterpart friday " offering profound apologies and asking pardon for the deeds of the 1940s , " president @entity23 told @entity1 en @entity30 in a telephone interview from @entity32			1
" though it happened 64 years ago , it really is a profound violation of human rights , " said @entity23 , who said the report took him by surprise			2
@entity8 called him on thursday , he said			2
" she too offered her apologies , " he said , adding that she told him she was ashamed the @entity2 had been involved in the matter			1
asked whether @entity5 was planning to take legal action , @entity23 said , " that 's part of the work of the commission			1
" " we reject these types of actions , obviously , " said @entity5 presidential spokesman @entity45			1
" we know that this took place some time ago , but this is unacceptable and we recognize the apology from @entity8			2
" the scientific investigation , called the @entity2 @entity54 of 1946 - 1948 , aimed at determining the effectiveness of penicillin in treating or preventing syphilis after subjects were exposed to the disease			1
gonorrhea and chancres were also studied			2
@entity62 was a relatively new drug at the time			2
the tests were carried out on female commercial sex workers , prisoners in the national penitentiary , patients in the national mental hospital and soldiers			0
according to the study , more than 1,600 people were infected : 696 with syphilis , 772 with gonorrhea and 142 with chancres			0
the study came to light recently when @entity77 researcher @entity76 found the archived but unpublished notes from the project as she was researching a similar study that was conducted between 1932 and 1972 in @entity81 , @entity82			0
that study included nearly 400 poor @entity85 - @entity2 men with preexisting syphilis whose disease was allowed to progress without treatment			1
researchers did not infect the subjects , but they did not tell them they had the disease either			0
the @entity93 study was done under the direction of dr. @entity95 , a @entity2 @entity54 medical officer who died in 2003			1
" i was doing what historians do , " said @entity76 , a professor of the history of ideas and women and gender issues , who has written a book on the @entity93 study			0
she went to the @entity104 , where @entity95 had taught , and searched through an archive of his papers			0
" there was nothing on @entity81 in the papers , but there was this report of the @entity5 study , " she told @entity1 in a telephone interview			1
" i started to read , and i almost fell off my chair			0
" she found that @entity95 also led the research in @entity5			1
it was carried out there , in part , she said , because prostitution was legal and prisoners were allowed to bring prostitutes in for sex			0
dr. @entity123 , director of the @entity124 , told reporters that the @entity5 study represented " a dark chapter in the history of medicine			2
" the study " appears to have been funded " by the @entity144 , he said , citing four primary ethical violations : 1 ) study subjects " were members of one or more vulnerable populations ; " 2 ) there is no evidence they gave informed consent ; 3 ) they were often deceived about what was being done to them ; 4 ) they were intentionally infected with pathogens that could cause serious illness without their understanding or consent			0
@entity2 officials said friday that ethical safeguards would prevent such abuses from occurring today			2
an @entity150 task force will look at what happened in the study , and a group of ethics experts will convene to review the matter and report on how best to ensure such abuses do not recur , @entity123 said			0
" the study is a sad reminder that adequate human subject safeguards did not exist a half - century ago , " the @entity2 statement said			1
" today , the regulations that govern @entity2 - funded human medical research prohibit these kinds of appalling violations			1
" @entity123 said the published literature contains more than 40 other @entity2 - based studies " where intentional infection was carried out with what we could now consider to be completely inadequate consent in the @entity2			2
" many of those studies were funded by the @entity54 , he said			0
but at least some people believed at the time that the experiment was flawed , according to @entity77 's @entity176 , who cited this reaction to @entity95 's work from his supervisor , @entity54 physician @entity172 : " i am a bit , in fact more than a bit , leery of the experiment with insane people , " @entity172 said			0
" they can not give consent , do not know what is going on , and if some good organization got wind of the work , they would raise a lot of smoke			0
i think the soldiers would be best or the prisoners for they can give consent			0
maybe i 'm too conservative ... in the report , i see no reason to say where the work was done and the type of volunteer			0
" " the vast majority " of study subjects were adequately treated for their illness , @entity123 said			0
one subject died during an epileptic seizure , though it was not clear that the death was related to the study , he added			0
@entity95 's work helped refine testing procedures and suggested a better means of prevention , but " made little impact on syphilis research , " @entity76 concluded			2
@entity8 and @entity9 said the @entity2 is launching an investigation and also convening a group of international experts to review and report on the most effective methods to make sure all human medical research worldwide meets rigorous ethical standards			1
" as we move forward to better understand this appalling event , we reaffirm the importance of our relationship with @entity5 , and our respect for the @entity5 people , as well as our commitment to the highest standards of ethics in medical research , " the @entity2 statement said			1
@entity1 's @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 and @entity235 's @entity234 contributed to this report .			0
