-- @entity2 's bid to end her long wait for a second @entity5 crown came crashing to a halt on monday , while @entity8 ' final appearance at the grass - court grand slam also finished in round four			1
@entity12 lost her rematch with @entity14 , who she beat in last year 's semifinals before losing the title match			1
@entity2 won the event as a 17 - year - old in 2004 to announce herself as a new star in women 's tennis , but the defeat by @entity24 12 months ago is the closest she has come to a repeat success in @entity26			1
@entity28 15th seed @entity14 powered past her @entity30 opponent to win 6 - 4 6 - 3 and set up a last - eight clash with eighth - seeded compatriot @entity32 , who thrashed former no. 1 clijsters 6 - 1 6 - 1 in just 49 minutes			1
it is the first time that two @entity28 women have made it to the second week of the tournament since 1995 , when @entity38 won the title for the sixth time and @entity41 lost in round four			2
" it 's just unbelievable			0
i had lost the last three meetings with her , so it 's nice to finally win one , " said @entity14 , who had lost five matches in a row coming into @entity5 , including a first - round defeat at the @entity48			1

i felt great , it 's my favorite tournament			0
i love the crowd and playing on grass			0
i 'm a fighter and i fight to the last game			0
i think i 'm getting better with each match			0
" @entity2 , who won the @entity48 last month after losing in january 's @entity61 final , struggled after going 3 - 1 down in the opening set and a 45 - minute rain delay did not help her get back into rhythm			1
" she did many things better than i did			0
she played very well , " said @entity2 , who saved two match - points			1
" i could have done things differently but not on this particular day			0
" four - time grand slam champion @entity8 , who has never got past the semifinals at @entity5 , could not get going against @entity32 -- who fired 19 winners to 10 , and just five unforced errors to the @entity74 's 13			1
@entity8 , 29 , will retire for the second time following september 's @entity75 , a tournament she has won three times			1
" i think the first year that i played here , i was here just to take it all in			0
i do n't even think i was here to play tennis			0
i needed to just open my eyes and look at everything , " @entity8 said of her first @entity5 appearance in 1999			1
" it was such an amazing thing			0
to me this was like @entity86 to another child			0
it was such a beautiful thing			0
" in the other half of the @entity5 draw , four - time winner @entity89 will face defending champion @entity24 in the quarterfinals after both battled through with three - set victories			1
@entity89 , seeking her first grand slam title since 2010 , triumphed 6 - 1 2 - 6 7 - 5 against @entity97 @entity96 out on @entity98			2
@entity96 won a record 24 points out of 24 in her first set against @entity48 runnerup @entity101 on saturday , but made a poor start in windy conditions before battling back to level			0
@entity89 , bouncing back from her first - round exit at @entity48 , hit 35 winners to 24 , and made 13 unforced errors to her opponent 's 20			1
" the bottom line is i can play so much better than i am			0
if i could n't do better that would be a problem , " @entity89 said			2
@entity112 has never beaten the @entity114 sixth seed , losing both meetings in 2010 at the @entity61 and then the @entity5 semifinals			2
the @entity118 left - hander came from behind against 2010 @entity48 champion @entity119 as she beat the @entity120 4 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 1			2
@entity119 , at 32 the oldest player left in the draw , paid for her 13 double faults and struggled to keep her cool after slipping on the wet grass at the end of the second set			0
world no. 37 @entity127 reached the quarterfinals for the second year in a row , beating @entity120 21st seed @entity131 6 - 2 6 - 2			1
the 21 - year - old @entity132 , who has lost in the first round of five of her last six grand slam appearances , will next face second seed @entity135 of @entity137			2
@entity61 champion @entity135 was unaffected by a rain break as the roof was closed on @entity140 as she demolished @entity142 's @entity141 6 - 1 6 - 0 in a battle of former world no. 1s			1
