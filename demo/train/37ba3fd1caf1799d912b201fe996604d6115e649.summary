the 25 - year - old striker made an unscheduled departure , flying home to @entity11 without telling city manager @entity12 that he had to attend to some " urgent family business "			1
it was expected that @entity12 would fine the £ 32.5 million ( $ 46m ) striker approximately two weeks wages , which would be touching £ 200,000 ( $ 283.5m ) , but there have also been suggestions that the city manager would not impose a punishment at all			1
however , @entity12 has denied that allegation , confirming that @entity3 will be punished			2
" i 've had a talk with @entity3 , " @entity12 told the @entity24 's @entity23			2
" i have read some of the things that have been said this morning but nothing could be further from the truth			0
" i have told @entity30 about the situation and our intention is to fine him			0
but there is a disciplinary procedure that has to be gone through and that is what we are doing at the moment			0
but what i would like to say is that he will be treated no differently to any other member of the squad			0
" @entity3 returned to @entity42 from @entity43 at the weekend and trained yesterday			2
it is expected he will line - up alongside new arrivals @entity45 and @entity47 when @entity1 entertain @entity48 in the @entity2 on wednesday evening .			0
