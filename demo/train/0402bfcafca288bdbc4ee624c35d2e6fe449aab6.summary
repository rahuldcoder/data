@entity0 has given the people of @entity2 a rare treat : a color mosaic that captures not only @entity5 , but also the tiny dots of @entity2 and other planets in the background			2
the panorama , released tuesday , was captured by the @entity10 on july 19 , when the sun slipped behind the ringed planet			2
@entity2 appears as a bright blue dot to @entity5 's lower right , just above @entity5 's outer , halo - like e-ring			2
@entity17 is a dot to the upper left , with @entity20 appearing as a faint red dot above and to the left of @entity17			0
this is the first image in which @entity5 , its moons and rings , and @entity2 , @entity17 and @entity20 are all visible , @entity0 said			1
the image -- a panorama of 141 wide - angle pictures -- covers 404,880 miles across @entity5 and its ring system			1
@entity10 images showing both @entity5 and @entity2 are rare because the sun is so close to @entity2 , that targeting the blue planet would damage @entity10 's sensors , @entity0 says			1
the july 19 image was possible because @entity5 blocked out the sun. lonely , young planet drifting in space without a star space - minded earthlings might remember that july 19 was " @entity40 " day			1
the @entity10 team , knowing it would be capturing the @entity5 - @entity2 images , invited people to take photos of themselves waving to the sky while the spacecraft took @entity2 's picture			1
@entity10 was never going to see people gesturing from the tiny blue speck , of course , but that was n't the point			0
people shared more than 1,400 images of themselves from that event , and in august , @entity0 released a collage of those pictures assembled to look like -- from a distance -- a portion of @entity2 's @entity58			0
the @entity10 spacecraft was launched in 1997 and has been in orbit around the sixth planet from the sun since 2004			0
@entity0 hopes to have it continue to get more pictures and other data of @entity5 , its rings and moons through 2017			0
diamonds may be produced on other planets , including @entity5			0

image is @entity10 's first showing @entity5 , rings , moons , @entity2 , @entity17 and @entity20 at same time
the collage is panorama of 141 wide - angle pictures taken july 19
image was possible that day because @entity5 obstructed spacecraft 's view of sun
