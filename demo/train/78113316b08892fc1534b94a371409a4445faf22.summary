@entity0 -- they can fly 300 yards through the air and have helped turn the likes of @entity5 into multi-millionaires , but it seems the powers of the golf ball do n't end there			2
for the last few days , @entity11 have been using golf balls in an audacious attempt to plug the disastrous @entity15 oil spill in the @entity16 , which has been described by the @entity18 administration as probably " the biggest environmental disaster " the country has ever faced			1
@entity11 press officer @entity21 told @entity1 that the balls had been used part of a " junk shot " including shredded tires and knotted rope that were pumped into the well at high pressure to plug the leak			1
mud and cement was then injected into the well to keep the junk in place			0
@entity21 revealed that this process was carried out " a number of times " in conjunction with the @entity38 coast guard before the oil giant admitted that the experiment had failed			2
golf balls were selected as part of the ' junk shot ' because they are small enough to plug gaps between the rope and tires and strong enough to withstand the pressure of the oil which is gushing out with significant force			1
@entity51 , @entity52 or any other make ( @entity11 were unable to confirm either the brand or numbers used ) golf balls are designed to withstand 2,000 pounds of force from a club making them a good candidate to withstand the high pressure oil leak			1
engineers first used the ' junk shot ' to quell the 1991 @entity61 oil fires but never at such depths			0
the fact that the @entity15 leak is 5,000 feet below the surface of the ocean is thought to be the reason the technique did not succeed			0
" i do n't think we 'll be using golf balls again , " commented @entity21			1
@entity38 president @entity18 said the failure of the earlier " top kill " plan was " heartbreaking "			0
the spill started over a month ago when the @entity15 rig caught fire and exploded , killing 11 workers			0
over 40 days on and @entity11 have still to stop the leak			2
@entity11 has spent more than Â£ 600m trying to stem the estimated 5,000 barrels of oil per day flowing out from the wellhead			1
previous failed attempts have included a coffer dam , a tube to suck the oil up to the surface and top kill			0
@entity11 will next try to cap the well using an underwater robot that will try to cut the leaking pipe and place a cap over it -- a process known as deploying the @entity93			1
@entity11 said that the cost of tackling the spill had increased to $ 930 million			2
the final cost , including legal damages arising from the accident , is still uncertain			0
the @entity99 recently released data showing that the oil was leaking at up to 19,000 barrels per day , nearly four times higher than @entity11 's previous estimate of 5,000 barrels			1
the oil giant initially claimed after the @entity15 rig sank on april 22 that just 1,000 barrels per day were leaking from the well			0
the latest figures indicate that between 18.6 million gallons and 29.5 million gallons of crude oil have leaked into the sea , outstripping the 11 million gallons spilled in the 1989 @entity110 .			0

' @entity112 ' using golf balls , rope and tires to plug holes in oil well fails .
golf balls selected because of small size and ability to withstand pressure .
@entity11 's next plan is to send in underwater robot to cut pipe and cap it .
