-- in a most public fashion , congressional lawmakers have been grilling @entity4 officials this week about safety defects that have caused some of the automaker 's vehicles to accelerate without warning			1
accidents and deaths are being linked to these problems			0
this is prime political theater			0
angry lawmakers are aggressively demanding answers , dressing down their corporate counterparts			0
@entity4 officials are largely apologetic			1
@entity4 president @entity17 wept after the @entity19 hearing wednesday			1
what 's largely occluded from television cameras , however , are the long , deep ties between @entity4 , former federal government employees and current lawmakers , some of whom are ( or have been ) tasked with providing oversight , upholding public safety and , at the moment , potentially recommending regulatory changes			1
of course , ties do not mean tepid congressional questioning , nor do they mean tough regulations will not result from committee hearings			1
but as consumers -- and citizens -- watch the hearings transpire , it 's worth remembering that @entity38 is a place where the public interest is n't always politicians ' first or only interest			2
in 2009 , @entity4 employed 31 lobbyists , hired to exert influence and defend the company 's interests before @entity47 , the @entity48 and federal agencies , such as the @entity50 and @entity51			1
so who are these @entity4 lobbyists working the back channels of government ? our research indicates that in many instances , they 're former members of the @entity60 government , earning handsome salaries lobbying on behalf of their corporate client			1
among the leaders in this small army of lobbyists ( and registered as such in 2009 ) are a former congressman , two former chiefs of staff for prominent senator currently serving , a former @entity51 assistant secretary , a former assistant director of the @entity72 on @entity73 and a former special events director for the @entity75			0
this is a group that ca n't be easily dismissed by congressional leaders and their staffs			0
in politics , just like any social realm , it 's simpler to say " no " to a stranger than someone who used to work for you or with you , or someone you may have even campaigned for			0
now , in @entity4 's period of political peril , the company will probably need the help of its lobbyists to mitigate damage to its corporate interests			2
by december , @entity4 had spent about $ 5.4 million on federal lobbying efforts for 2009 , more than @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 or any other foreign automaker			2
during the past five years , @entity4 's federal lobbying expenditures total nearly $ 25 million , about enough to buy two new @entity101 hybrids for every member of @entity47			1
among automakers , only @entity103 and @entity104 have each spent more money to lobby the federal government during that time			0
as for lawmakers themselves , they , too , have connections to @entity4			2
in 2008 , the most recent year for which data are available , seven members of @entity47 reported owning @entity4 stock			1
rep. @entity116 , @entity117 , who represents that district in which @entity4 's @entity60 headquarters is located , declared in her 2008 personal financial disclosure report that she and her husband owned $ 315,000 in @entity4 assets			2
@entity123 , who serves on the @entity124 , which is investigating @entity4 , said this week that she 'd recuse herself from committee proceedings and votes , an appropriate step to avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest			2
no other member of @entity47 has publicly followed suit , including rep. @entity131 , @entity132 , another @entity4 stock owner in 2008 who also sits on the committee			1
sen. @entity134 , a @entity135 from @entity136 , does n't own @entity4 stock , but he was instrumental in wooing @entity4 to build a factory in his state , once saying he " felt like a full - fledged member " of @entity4 's site selection team			2
@entity134 , chairman of the @entity142 's @entity141 , is slated to serve as the @entity142 's lead investigator into @entity4 's safety issues ( hearings begin next week ) and whether the @entity146 properly monitored safety concerns about the company			1
the agency 's new chief ? he 's @entity151 , a former lawyer and senior staff member for @entity134 's @entity142 committee			0
( a spokeswoman for @entity134 told the @entity155 this week that the senator fought " for good - paying manufacturing jobs but never shirks from holding those same companies ' feet to the fire when it comes to safety and consumer protection			0
" ) lawmakers are also the beneficiaries of money @entity4 has directly donated to their political campaigns			2
although @entity4 itself can not create a political action committee through which to make donations to politicians -- foreign firms are banned from doing so -- the @entity60 - based @entity4 distributor , @entity4 , faces no such restriction			0
@entity4 's political action committee has contributed at least $ 1,000 to each of 10 federal political candidates this election cycle after making donations to 29 federal candidates during the 2008 election cycle			0
included on this list -- for 2007 and 2008 -- are members of the congressional committees investigating @entity4 : reps			1
@entity186 , @entity132 ; @entity187 , @entity188 ; @entity189 , @entity190 ; @entity191 , @entity192 ; and @entity193 , @entity194			0
since 1999 , @entity4 employees in the @entity60 have also individually donated more than $ 100,000 to congressional members			1
taken separately , these associations may not amount to a smoking gun of profit and politics over people			0
but together , they represent a ruck of entanglements and potential conflicts of interest that must be adequately checked by the press			0
and the public must be mindful of these ties , lest they deliver on their potential to render safety subservient to a financial bottom line			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 and @entity217 .			0

@entity4 hearings were a major event on @entity221
less visible were ties between @entity4 and current , former members of @entity47 , *co-authors* say
they say the public should be mindful of potential for abuses
