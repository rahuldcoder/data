@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 , the mysterious castaway who turned up in the @entity1 last week , has been released from a hospital			1
he had been readmitted thursday amid concerns that his health was deteriorating			2
doctors reported that he was severely dehydrated , running low on vitamins and suffering from swollen legs			0
@entity3 , whose tale of surviving 13 months adrift in the @entity11 has prompted fascination and skepticism , left the hospital friday and is now staying at a hotel in @entity0 , the capital of the island chain			1
hospital officials did n't provide an update on his condition			2
but dr. @entity20 , a retired @entity23 medic working at the hospital who has spent time with @entity3 , said he was concerned about the state of the castaway 's kidneys			1
@entity3 , an @entity30 who had been living in @entity32 before he got lost at sea , washed ashore in the @entity1 more than a week ago			1
earlier this week , his condition improved enough for him to be released from the hospital			2
what you should know about his journey but after his health took a turn for the worse thursday , plans for his repatriation to @entity41 have now been postponed			2
@entity42 , who is not @entity3 's treating physician , said the castaway had complained to him of kidney pain since his arrival at the hospital			1
the 78 - year - old doctor , who speaks @entity50 , said he suspects that @entity3 is suffering from scurvy as a result of his poor diet and that edemas are causing the swelling and pain in his legs			1
@entity3 has said that he survived during his months at sea by eating raw fish and turtles			1
he says he relied on rainwater and urine for fluids			0
when the doctor spoke with the castaway , he noticed that his fingers were stiff and he moved his hands slowly			1
@entity3 complained of pain in his joints , knees and ankles , @entity42 said			1
the first time @entity42 saw @entity3 in the emergency room , his legs were hard and his skin was leathery			1
but when he returned to the hospital this week , his legs had changed to swollen , and his skin was tender and red , he said			1
the doctor 's assumption is that the castaway is recovering , but that it is a process that will take weeks , not days			1
@entity42 also believes that @entity3 is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder			2
official : his story is probable @entity3 's claims have garnered widespread skepticism about how he could survive for 13 months adrift in the @entity11			1
but from what officials can tell , they have no reason to doubt him			0
" the investigations into mr. @entity3 's story so far have been substantiated , " @entity89 , the @entity1 ' foreign affairs minister , said thursday			1
@entity93 - @entity92 , a @entity32 diplomat working on @entity3 's case , said that the castaway was an undocumented worker in @entity32 , but that " what he has said to us about his identity , so far , has been true			1
" " the main question now is how long was he at sea , " he said			2
@entity92 said " it 's probable " that @entity3 did get lost at sea starting in december 2012 , as the castaway has claimed			1
if @entity3 's story proves true , the trip across the @entity11 would have taken him across roughly 6,600 miles ( 10,800 kilometers ) of open ocean before ending in the @entity1 , about halfway between @entity105 and @entity106 , in the @entity107			1
the other man @entity3 says he set off on a fishing trip from the port of @entity111 , @entity32 , near the southern coastal city of @entity113			2
he said he and another man intended to spend a day trying to catch sharks , but they were blown off course by winds and then got caught in a storm , eventually losing use of their engines			0
@entity122 , the owner of @entity3 's boat in @entity32 , identified the fishing partner as 23 - year - old @entity125			1
@entity3 said that four weeks into their drift , his companion died of starvation because he refused to eat raw birds and turtles			2
eventually , he threw the body overboard			0
" what else could i do ? " @entity3 said			2
a grieving family back in the @entity32 village of @entity137 , @entity125 's family is inconsolable			2
more than a year after the young man went missing , his mother is grieving his death			0
" the pain is so great , i ca n't explain it , " @entity125 's mother said			0
" losing a child is the hardest thing to bear in life			0
" @entity125 's brother said the 23 - year - old took care of his family -- and that 's why he became a fisherman , in hopes of earning a better livelihood			0
" my brother was kind , he was responsible for my mother , " he said			0
" in fact , he worked in the sea because of her			0
he wanted to improve himself			0
he did n't want to be poor , like us			0
" now that @entity125 's mother knows her son is dead , she wants answers			0
" as a mother , i demand the authorities allow me to talk to the survivor , " she said			0
