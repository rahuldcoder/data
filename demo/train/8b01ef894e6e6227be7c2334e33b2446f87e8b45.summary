@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 @entity5 @entity4 candidate @entity3 just might be the @entity7 's biggest gamble yet			1
a staunch conservative with a history of making bold and sometimes controversial comments , @entity8 insists her comments have been taken out of context in her campaign to oust senate majority leader @entity15 in upcoming midterm congressional elections			1
" i 'll be a mainstream senator , " said @entity8			2
a grandmother of 10 children who secured the backing of @entity7 leaders on her way to winning the @entity5 nomination for @entity4 , @entity8 has been both praised and criticized for her views			1
in past remarks during the campaign , @entity8 has said @entity26 and @entity27 should be phased out			2
she 's also advocated the elimination of the @entity30 , the @entity31 and the @entity32			0
@entity8 established herself as an ardent conservative during her six - year tenure in the @entity36			2
" @entity3 was the @entity7 before the @entity7 existed , " @entity1 political journalist @entity37 said of the @entity5 , adding she was a " far right " candidate			1
while @entity8 's controversial stances have bolstered her standing with the @entity7 , they have provided fodder for @entity43 , who perceive the 60 - year - old @entity7 candidate a threat to one of @entity48 's most prominent @entity43			1
in response , @entity15 has called his opponent " too extreme " in tv ads airing across the state , and even president @entity51 weighed in at a july event for @entity15 , saying , " [ @entity8 ] favors an approach that 's even more extreme than the @entity5 we 've got in @entity48			1
" when @entity2 caught up with @entity8 at one of her @entity0 , @entity1 , campaign stops , she complained some of her more controversial statements had been taken out of context			1
" as you speak , as we 're conversationally speaking , sometimes when you pick out words , they 're not the best words you could have used , " she told @entity2 in a rare one - on - one interview			0
" when taken out of context , you can make anybody look like they do n't know what they 're talking about , " she said			0
" it 's a little hard to take out of context when they say they want to phase out @entity26 , " @entity15 responded to @entity2			1
" her words are what she is			0
my words are what i am			0
so i do n't think you can run from what you say and what you do			0
" @entity8 has also made some contentious comments on friendly conservative talk radio programs , which have bolstered her detractors ' views that she is an extremist			2
in a january appearance on the @entity94 , @entity1 - based @entity93 , @entity8 implied the purpose of the @entity97 right to bear arms might be to keep the federal government in check			1
" i 'm hoping that we 're not getting to @entity97 remedies			0
i hope that the vote will be the cure for the @entity15 problems , " she said , generating a slew of questions about her intent			2
when @entity2 asked about @entity8 's ominous - sounding warning , she laughed off the notion she was promoting an armed revolution			2
" those are not the issues people are concerned about			0
they 're concerned about our economy , our homes , our jobs			0
that 's what people are concerned about , " she said , not offering an explanation of her remarks			0
@entity2 also asked @entity8 about her affirmation of the same conservative host 's observation that there are " home - born , homegrown " enemies operating in @entity133			2
" the larger focus of that conversation is what has happened domestically here and our country for the last 18 months , " @entity8 said , pointing out that no names were mentioned during the conversation , and again not addressing directly the intent of her statement			0
it 's easy to see how @entity8 's staunch views appeal to the @entity7 , but even some of her fellow @entity1 @entity5 are wary that she is too conservative			1
in an interview with @entity2 affiliate @entity151 , @entity94 mayor @entity152 , who is a @entity5 from @entity8 's hometown , called @entity8 " an ultra-right winger " who he will not support in november			1
another prominent @entity1 @entity5 , former rep. @entity157 described @entity8 as " rigid " in her beliefs in an interview to the @entity160			1
" she 's a very difficult person			0
she 's very positive in her own way , but when you 're elected you have to work for everybody , " @entity157 told the newspaper			0
but it 's not just politicians who are concerned			0
in a poll released by the @entity160 on august 27 , 71 percent of @entity1 @entity5 admit they would prefer to see a different @entity5 candidate take on @entity15			1
of those republicans who voted for @entity8 in the primary election , 66 percent now say they 'd like another nominee			0
@entity15 fares better with his own party , but is still far from a perfect candidate in the eyes of @entity1 voters , many of whom see the high - profile @entity180 as a @entity48 insider who brokered deals infamously known as the " @entity183 " and " the @entity184 " to pass health care reform			1
" @entity15 is the most negatively viewed person in this state and there is a hardened opposition to him			1
i think @entity3 could be arrested for a felony tomorrow and still get percent 40 percent of the vote , " @entity37 told @entity2			0
that explains why , despite @entity8 's controversial candidacy , polls show @entity1 voters evenly split between the " extremist " challenger and the " establishment " senator			1
the high - profile race is considered a statistical dead heat where , even in the gambling capital of the world , there is no odds - on favorite , making it a bellwether of just how influential the @entity7 might be in future elections .			2
