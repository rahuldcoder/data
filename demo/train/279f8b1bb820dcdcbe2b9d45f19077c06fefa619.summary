-- this morning in @entity2 , @entity1 held a press event announcing the launch of @entity5 , the world 's first @entity6 - only " newspaper			1
" while i listened to the streaming audio , i was scanning the news -- and i spotted a headline that should probably make @entity13 nervous about its new venture : @entity15 blocks @entity17 e-book app. is @entity19 next ? first , a bit about @entity5 , per today 's announcement : according to @entity13 , @entity6 owners can subscribe to @entity5 with one click , at a weekly rate of 99 cents			1
an annual subscription costs $ 39.99			2
the publication also will display paid advertising			0
furthermore , @entity1 confirmed that the @entity6 will probably be the only provider for @entity5 for this year and next year			1
eventually @entity13 will be developing editions for all tablet platforms , but for right now , it 's effectively an @entity6 exclusive -- which means @entity13 is relying heavily on the terms of the deal it 's worked out with @entity15 to make the economics of this venture pay off			1
meanwhile , there 's that @entity15 / @entity17 / @entity19 flap , which was sparked largely by this @entity41 article			1
in a nutshell , @entity15 rejected @entity17 's new @entity44 / @entity6 e-reader app from its app store in part because that app would jump readers out into the mobile browser in order to buy e-books			1
this strategy skirts @entity15 's considerable 30 % cut for in - app purchases -- and it 's how @entity56 's popular @entity19 app has handled purchases from the beginning			1
@entity15 claims that this is not a bait - and - switch rule change			0
the @entity41 ran this quote from an @entity15 spokesperson @entity61 : " we have not changed our developer terms or guidelines			0
... we are now requiring that if an app offers customers the ability to purchase books outside of the app , that the same option is also available to customers from within the app with in - app purchase			0
" which is where @entity15 takes its 30 % cut			0
i 'm sure @entity13 has worked out with @entity15 a percentage of subscription revenues that go to @entity15			2
and that 's fair , since @entity15 is providing distribution for @entity5			1
but what if those terms were to effectively change without notice ? this @entity17 decision could very likely be a red flag that @entity15 is willing to change the rules of how it does business without notice , in ways that could affect all of its app providers			2
@entity13 has invested lavishly in @entity5 , reportedly $ 30 million , including a staff of 120 and prime @entity93 office space			2
they 're betting heavily that @entity5 will pay off big			0
but if i were @entity1 -- or @entity56 , for that matter -- right now i would be afraid for my @entity98 - dependent ventures			0
it might be a good idea for @entity13 to bump up the development schedule for its @entity103 edition .			0

@entity13 launched a @entity6 newspaper called @entity5
the @entity5 will cost 99 cents a week , $ 39.99 a year
