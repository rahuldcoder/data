if you are fan of goal - packed football matches look away now			0
and whatever you do steer well clear of @entity4			2
in the @entity7 , often described as the most entertaining in the world , the @entity6 - based team are a mundane anomaly			1
with over half of the current season gone , @entity4 are the @entity7 's lowest scorers with 11 goals in 20 games			1
that miserly total is the lowest of all the 92 clubs in @entity19 's four - tier football pyramid , with only @entity21 's @entity20 dipping below @entity4 's scoring ratio of one goal every 1.8 games			1
in @entity27 , leaders @entity26 have rattled in 56 goals in 16 games , while over in @entity21 , @entity30 have notched 41 goals in 17 games			0
in @entity33 , a league that prides itself on defensive ruthlessness and was so in love with the idea of defence they even invented a word for it -- @entity42 -- leaders @entity43 are averaging two goals every game			0
so if @entity47 football is the land of goalscoring gunslingers , @entity4 are very much the stumbling drunk crouching behind the saloon door			0
for the hardy souls who attend the team 's matches , now is the winter of their discontent			0
in the seven matches @entity4 have played at their @entity63 stadium , @entity60 's shot - shy side has managed just seven goals			1
to put that into context , fans who own season tickets have been paying between $ 25 and $ 46 per goal			0
it 's hardly surprising that the team played in front of its lowest @entity7 attendance since 1999 during a december match against @entity75			1
three @entity7 players , @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 , have scored more league goals this season than the entire @entity4 team , while league leaders @entity83 and second placed @entity85 have each scored four times as many goals as the @entity6 team			1
even @entity19 's two cup competitions have proved scant consolation for those @entity4 fans hoping their team might just cut loose away from the fevered pressure of the @entity7			1
@entity4 lost in the @entity94 to third tier @entity95 -- failing to score in the process			0
the @entity98 did provide a goal -- just the one mind -- though even then the @entity4 took 88 minutes to get off the mark before @entity103 's strike earned a 1 - 0 win over second tier @entity105			2
at times @entity4 fans must have felt the football gods were truly conspiring against them			0
how else to explain that first - tier @entity109 recently turned up in the @entity111 city to play @entity4 's rivals @entity6 and won 8 - 0 -- as many goals as the @entity113 have scored in their home city all season			1
despite the team 's unerring defiance of the very essence of the sport , it 's not all bad news for @entity4 fans with the team sitting in a surprisingly healthy league position			2
with only five wins to their name this season , @entity4 still find themselves 12th in the table six places and five points clear of the relegation zone -- the bottom three positions of the 20 - team league			1
this weekend they face bottom team @entity133 who , despite having picked up just 14 points to @entity4 's 22 , have scored eight more goals heading into saturday 's match			1
social media has been a release mechanism for the club 's fans , with many using statistics to damn @entity4 's lousy performances , with manager @entity60 taking his fair share of the flak			1
@entity4 are the only side in the @entity7 yet to have a substitute score a goal this season			2
and it 's probably fair to say that @entity60 could n't be described as a game - changing manager when it comes to the art of substitutions -- just three goals have been scored by substitutes during the 96 top - flight games @entity60 has overseen			1
according to @entity60 it 's not just his shot - shy team that are responsible for @entity4 's goal drought			1
" there 's been some good goalkeeping in games and some poor finishing , " @entity60 told reporters ahead of the @entity164 game against @entity165 -- a match that @entity4 lost 1 - 0			1
" it 's not a lack of confidence			0
that 's just the way it is			0
" things have gone against us in the last third , there 's been good goalkeeping			0
" but if the lads keep creating chances they will go in			0
" i do n't have a problem -- as long as they keep going into those areas to miss them			0
" @entity4 have now gone three league games without a goal -- the last time the opposition net bulged in a league match was on december 20 in the 1 - 1 home draw against @entity195			2
their goal in that match was scored by @entity103 , a @entity198 striker who actually does know where the net is , but has only played 10 league games due to injury and suspension			0
the 24 - year - old 's record of 37 goals in 79 games since joining @entity4 in 2012 is impressive , making @entity4 's difficulties all the more baffling			2
if you have the misfortune of watching @entity4 this weekend , spare a thought for the forlorn @entity103			0
history shows that @entity4 are not alone in their @entity7 impotence and it 's a story that might just provide a ray of hope for @entity4 's long suffering supporters			2
@entity216 matched @entity4 's uninspiring total at the same stage of the 2005 - 06 campaign , although the @entity221 club did give their supporters something to cheer about in the remaining 18 games of that season by scoring 23 goals			1
remarkably , two teams have registered lowing goalscoring totals at this stage of a @entity7 season			2
@entity231 and @entity85 both had just 10 goals after 20 games of the 1995 - 96 and 2007 - 08 seasons respectively .			0

@entity4 have scored just 11 goals during the 2014 - *15* @entity7 season
the @entity6 - based club are the lowest scorers in the @entity241
despite their low scoring , @entity4 sit 12th in the table
