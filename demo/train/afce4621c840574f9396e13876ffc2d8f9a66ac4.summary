@entity0 -- insurgents were able to use a mass - market software program to view live feeds from @entity3 military predator drones monitoring targets in @entity9 , a @entity3 official indicated to @entity1 thursday			1
the breach by @entity13 - backed @entity12 militants was discovered late last year , according to @entity3 military and defense officials			1
the story was first reported in the @entity17 on thursday			0
the @entity3 official , who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the information , said no @entity3 troops or combat missions had been compromised because of the intrusion			1
there also is evidence that unmanned aerial vehicle ( @entity25 ) feeds also have been hacked in @entity26 , according to the @entity17 article , but there was no evidence the militants were able to take control of the remote aircrafts ' systems in either country			2
the inexpensive software , created by a @entity37 company called @entity38 , is downloadable off the @entity39			1
it allows users to take advantage of unprotected communication links in some of the @entity25			0
a senior defense official who was not authorized to speak about the security breach said , " this was an old issue for us and it has been taken care of , " but he would not elaborate on what specifically had been taken care of			0
the official said that many of the @entity25 feeds need to be sent out live to numerous people at one time , and encryption was found to slow the real - time link			1
the encryption therefore was removed from many feeds			0
removing the encryption , however , allowed outsiders with the correct tools to gain unauthorized access to these feeds			0
@entity64 spokesman @entity63 would not comment on any of the article 's details but said that any security breaches that arise are addressed			0
" the department constantly evaluates and seeks to improve both the performance as well as the security of various intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance systems and platforms , " @entity63 said			0
" if and when we identify any shortfalls we obviously correct them as a continuous process of seeking both improved capabilities as well as improved security			0
" lt. gen. @entity81 , who is in charge of the @entity84 's @entity25 mission , said the military is trying to fix vulnerabilities with improved encryption on @entity25 feeds			2
" those kinds of things are subject to listening and exploitation , " he told reporters wednesday when asked about vulnerabilities of @entity25 systems			0
one @entity3 official said special operations troops identified the threat " years ago " in @entity9 and over the past two years have been " vastly improving " encryption on their various communications systems , including full - motion video			1
the official said the @entity3 generally can operate these systems with impunity in third - world countries that do n't have the technology to tap into open satellite feeds			1
however , according to the official , @entity13 has been pushing the @entity38 - like technology to @entity12 militants in @entity9 essentially to see what the @entity3 is looking at because @entity13 believe they will be invaded next			1
the vulnerability could date back to the 1990s , said @entity111 , a military technology analyst for the @entity113			1
" in fact , in the @entity116 , people with any satellite dish were able to intercept the communications from these systems , and watch special operations raids in @entity121 while sitting in their home , " he said			0
before the @entity3 invasion of @entity9 in 2003 , it is believed @entity125 was able to monitor drone feeds			1
the @entity9 " located and downloaded the unencrypted satellite feed from @entity3 military @entity25 , " a 2005 @entity128 report surmised			1
the @entity3 military and intelligence operations use pilotless drones in @entity9 and @entity26 both for surveillance and to fire missiles at targets			2
while the @entity128 has never publicly acknowledged it , the agency operates the unmanned planes in @entity138 , where it has used drones to strike at @entity141 and @entity142 operatives , according to officials familiar with the strategy			0
but a @entity3 official with knowledge of @entity128 and military uav missions told @entity1 the drones used in @entity138 missions use encrypted feeds and are not vulnerable to hacking like the military drones used in @entity9			1
the official said the drones employed by the intelligence community in @entity138 , which use state - of - the - art encryption technology , are used in a much more limited capacity than the military drones			1
one of the developers of the @entity38 technology told @entity1 via e-mail that the software was developed to pull unprotected satellite feeds so that people in @entity37 could watch tv or gain access to the internet in areas otherwise unable to get such signals			1
" the software is intercepting data received from a satellite dish -- it does n't say whether or not the data is classified , let alone that it is military data , " said @entity168			2
he said the @entity3 military has not contacted him about the reported security breach			2
" even if i wanted to do something about it , i would n't know what to do , " he said			0
@entity168 insisted the software was not developed for the use it has been put to in @entity9			0
" [ it seems that ] somebody has invented a way to use this program outside of its intended purpose , " he said			0
" but generally speaking , this points to a large security gap that the @entity3 military has missed			2
" @entity1 's @entity191 and @entity192 contributed to this report .			2
