-- the medals have been presented , the caldron extinguished and the crowds dispersed , but there 's one record from the @entity6 that may have been overlooked : most condoms distributed at a @entity8			1
it 's hard to say this conclusively , and judges from other host cities may demand a recount , but @entity14 of @entity15 said the word on the public health street is that @entity18 is king of the prophylactic winter rings			1
over the course of 17 days , the health agency doled out 100,000 condoms , supplied by the @entity24			1
and after buzz , some based on rumors , grew that there was a shortage -- " we were not getting calls from people saying , ' help , i need condoms , ' " @entity14 laughed -- an emergency shipment of 8,500 additional rubbers came in from the @entity37			1
some media outlets reported that the supply was strictly for @entity41 and @entity42 athletes and officials , totaling about 6,500 people according to the @entity45			0
that would suggest an average of at least 15 condoms per person , and rampant sex of @entity41 proportions			0
but @entity14 , spokesman for @entity15 , clarified and said the free condoms were available not just to athletes and game officials			2
they were on the cruise ships that housed security , support staff and volunteers			0
they were in washrooms at public venues , including the downtown pavilions where visitors gathered for free concerts			0
they were handed out by volunteers and readily available in clinics			0
the mass distribution of rubbers was part of a greater effort to improve @entity74 and @entity75 awareness , @entity14 said			2
lots of people do n't have the same kind of access to public health messages about disease prevention , and " when you 've got a global audience like this , it 's a huge opportunity to educate the world , " he said			0
since the @entity87 in @entity88 , @entity89 , condoms have been distributed free to athletes			1
about 40,000 of the original 100,000 in @entity18 were for those staying in the athlete villages in @entity18 and @entity93 , @entity14 said			2
how many of them were actually used is an impossible question to answer			0
some say condoms were snagged as souvenirs , although @entity14 said they were not branded with @entity41 rings			0
he said he did hear stories of athletes from countries with inferior condoms stuffing their suitcases with the coveted rubbers			2
but no matter what happened to the condoms , the public health effort in @entity18 is one that makes him proud			1
" indications are that @entity18 topped the podium for @entity8 , " @entity14 said			1
" although we recently heard that they issued 35 million condoms for @entity114 in @entity115 , so i suppose we all have a long , long way to go to reach that mark			1

other may want a recount , but it seems @entity18 's tops for @entity8 condoms
more than 100,000 rubbers were distributed ; 8,500 more were sent as backup
since 1992 @entity87 , condoms have been free for athletes at games
health official proud of distribution , but hears @entity115 gave out 35 million at @entity114
