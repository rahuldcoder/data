-- @entity2 's life - changing career move started out simply enough -- she wanted a healthy baby			1
@entity6 native @entity5 started @entity7 to give her child healthy choices			1
more than three years later , that passion is a profession for the native of @entity6			1
she runs an organic baby food company , which is winning raves from some consumers and , even in a tough economy , has started to earn her a steady income			1
" i had a very hard time getting pregnant , and so when i got pregnant , i said i was just going to do everything right , which means the freshest foods for my child , " said @entity5 , 42 , who lives and works in @entity18 , @entity19 , a suburb of @entity20			0
but when she reached for baby food off the grocery - store shelves , she said , she did n't like what she found -- jars filled with sugar , additives and preservatives			1
it was a far cry from what she grew up with in her @entity36 home			2
" it 's more farm to table , so we do n't really deal with a lot of preservatives , " she said			1
" i could be eating plantains and know precisely where the plantains came from -- it was my backyard or a neighbor 's			2
" she started shopping for vegetables and fruits from her local farmers ' market			0
she cooked , chopped and blended to make baby food for her son , @entity52			1
her neighbors , friends and fellow church members started asking her to increase the sizes of the batches -- they wanted their children to have what her son was having			0
" it 's like , ' can you make it for me ? i ca n't do what you do			1
my child does n't like when i make it and you 're not there , ' " she said , mimicking the requests			2
finally , in 2006 , it got out of hand			0
" my husband ... even though he never said it , was like , ' ok , it 's about time you make some money doing this , ' " she said			2
today , three years after incorporating @entity7 , she 's still doing most of the shopping , chopping and cooking on her own			1
@entity2 works out of a rented commercial kitchen in @entity18			1
six employees , some of them @entity36 immigrants like herself , help with preparation and finances			0
her flavors run the gamut from simple -- organic potatoes , carrots and peas -- to adventurous -- such as organic adzuki beans and sweet potato porridge			0
but it was n't a move without sacrifice			2
@entity5 , who had come to the @entity95 in the early ' 90s , gave up a job as a manager for a hospitality software company and cashed in her 401 ( k ) retirement fund to get the venture off the ground			0
" that was money -- a lot of money , " she said			0
" but this is more fulfilling because i truly believe that i 'm making a difference in people 's lives			1
" business experts have mixed feelings on whether a down economy is a good time to start a small business			1
there 's the obvious concern about people spending less money and the difficulty in securing loans as the banking industry tries to claw its way out of meltdown mode			2
" right now the banks are failing left and right so it 's difficult to get credit , " said @entity125 spokeswoman @entity124			2
and there are the numbers that exist even in good times -- 20 percent of new businesses fail after the first year , and more than half have failed four years later , according to the @entity125			0
but there are positives , too			0
an economic crisis can be a good time for a new business to steal market share from established , but vulnerable , competitors , said @entity141 , director of the @entity142 at @entity143 in @entity144			0
and small businesses require fewer employees , have less overhead and are able to cut costs more easily than bigger rivals when the economy goes sour			1
of course , it does n't hurt to have a good product			0
in january , the parenting magazine cookie named @entity7 its " clear favorite " baby food after a taste test by a dozen moms			1
it celebrated the food 's wholesome makeup -- no sugar , salt , additives , preservatives , pesticides or fillers -- and said it offers " some of the most creative and texturally interesting flavors we 've seen			1
" making money has n't been automatic for @entity2 despite her growing success			1
up until about a year ago , the company was still operating at a slight loss			0
but now " we do n't need to dig into personal savings to support the business -- the business supports itself , " she said			2
@entity5 said she 's hoping the big profits will come soon			0
until then , she said her belief in what she 's doing is its own reward			0
" i truly believe that good food , healthy food , is not a privilege , it 's a right , " she said			2
" every child deserves to eat healthy food			0
