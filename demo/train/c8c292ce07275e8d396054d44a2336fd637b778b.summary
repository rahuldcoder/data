@entity0 , @entity1 -- in a classroom tucked away from the world in @entity1 's capital , @entity0 , students practice spelling			1
ranging in age from 6 to 11 , these girls all have one thing in common : they have either been raped or suffered through the rape of a loved one			2
even the 6 - year - old is a rape survivor			2
the baby of the class , she ca n't quite keep up with the spelling lesson but is happy to clap along			0
next door , in the clinic adjoining the class , a 7 - year - old boy and his mother are in for a checkup			0
the mother was raped and then watched , helpless , as her son was molested			0
too afraid to seek help , she did what she thought would help : washed her son 's wounds with hot water and salt for four excruciating days until they were found and brought here			0
the classroom and clinic are both part of the @entity37 and @entity36			1
founded in 2011 , it is the first rape crisis center in @entity1			1
today , the center has bases both in and outside @entity0 , providing a haven for the spiraling number of @entity1 victims of sexual violence			1
the figures are horrifying , with at least 1,700 women raped in camps for internally displaced people last year in @entity0 , according to @entity50 figures			1
the @entity51 and @entity36 was founded by the parents of @entity53 in the 1990s to help child soldiers , but it closed down after her father was assassinated by warlords , forcing the rest of the family to seek refuge in @entity61			2
eventually , she and her mother returned , and in 2011 , the center reopened with a new focus : helping the victims of sexual violence			1
for the safety of the @entity53 center 's staff and the victims it helps , @entity2 agreed not to reveal the location of the centers it visited			2
rape is n't just happening in the camps for those forced from their homes by fighting , @entity53 told @entity2 , but in the wider community , " which is also affected by rampant abuse of sexual and gender - based violence			1
" @entity53 says she believes a multitude of factors are to blame , but the chief one is conflict -- something that has affected every @entity1 during more than two decades of war			2
" rape is a well - known weapon of war , so that is one thing that is undeniable , " said @entity53			0
" there 's also harmful traditional practices			0
there 's also the destroyed social protection structures that were in place " but were destroyed by conflict , she adds			0
put all these factors together , she said , and " that is why rape is so indiscriminate " in @entity1			1
@entity106 stigma for the first time in decades , there is reason for optimism in @entity1 , thanks in part to the country 's newly appointed and popular president , @entity115 , and increased security in much of the country			1
but the plight of @entity1 's women has seen little improvement			1
while the center 's staff has gained some idea of the number of cases of sexual violence in @entity0 and its surrounding area , little is known about the scale of the problem further afield			1
rape in @entity1 carries huge social stigma , and after the long years of conflict , there is no way of knowing how many women are suffering in silence			1
when the new president was appointed last year , his public commitment to punishing those guilty of sexual offenses had an immediate impact , said @entity53			2
but those advances have been undone , she said , by events since			0
in february , @entity146 made headlines when she reported her rape at the hands of men she says were government soldiers			2
they took turns raping her , she told @entity2 , only stopping when they thought she was dead			0
but when she reported the crime , it was @entity146 who was arrested and convicted of defaming a government institution			0
eventually , she was freed after a huge international outcry , but she says her attackers have yet to face justice			0
and , like many of the women @entity2 spoke to , she has no faith they ever will			0
the @entity50 says 70 % of the rapes perpetrated in @entity1 are carried out by men in military uniforms			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity167 admits there 's a problem but insists that it is being addressed			1
" there 's been no effective government in @entity1 for such a long time , and people are disorganized ... but now we are organizing , and i think we 'll disconnect ... from the past , " he told @entity2			1
" we are doing everything possible , we are taking every step to ensure that women and girls are safe			0
" we have nominated a new commissioner , judiciary reforms , and ... we are constituting a new policy for making our women and children safer than ever			2
" ' underground network ' of women but women 's rights activists say the damage might already have been done			2
" i think it 's become a lot harder for women to report rape , " said @entity53			2
" one clear message was sent to them : that if you do report a rape , there 's as much of a chance of you ending up in jail as a perpetrator			2
it has not only become harder for women who are a survivor of rape to report it , but also people working with these people to work towards ending or responding to sexual violence			1
" there was a very dramatic decline in the figures for the last three months			0
i think it was nearly 60 %			0
" with public information limited and the stigma against speaking out so strong , the center has created " almost an underground network of women " to spread the word about its work , said @entity53			0
some women who have been supported by the center go on to help others , letting them know through word of mouth that these services exist			2
other women find their own way there or meet center staff out in the community , she said			0
what makes the situation worse is that often , the same woman is raped repeatedly , by different perpetrators , said @entity53			0
the center can help the woman each time , but " without the government 's support and putting in place mechanisms to protect these people , there will be no end to this impunity , " she said			1
@entity238 , who agreed to talk to @entity2 as long as a pseudonym was used to conceal her identity , told how after being raped she fled her home for what she thought was a new beginning in another part of town			0
in her new home -- and in spite of being pregnant with the first rapist 's baby , she says -- she was attacked again			0
she , like @entity146 , has no hope that justice will ever be done			0
make the perpetrators ' bear that burden ' the @entity50 is due to send in a @entity256 - funded team of experts on sexual violence to help the @entity1 government establish protection mechanisms			1
delegates at an international donor conference , held this month in @entity263 by the @entity256 and @entity1 governments , pledged to work together to tackle sexual violence			1
the issue will also be on the agenda at the @entity269 leaders ' summit to be hosted by the @entity256 in june			0
but it will take time and money to bring about change in a country that has so many pressing needs			0
@entity276 , @entity256 ambassador to @entity1 , told @entity2 that there were " no guarantees , " but the involvement of international partners should improve the chances of @entity1 living up to its commitments on sexual violence			1
" what needs to happen practically ( is ) to redress the balance , to turn this from a stigma of shame where the survivors , the victims of these horrible attacks , bear that burden , to one where it 's the perpetrators who feel ashamed about it , " he said			0
there is now a realization , he said , of the " huge , huge problem facing the country as a whole , as well as women and girls , " but it will take time to make the necessary changes to tackle sexual violence			1
these include better documentation of such crimes ; reforming the security sector , so that the army and police come under greater government control and win people 's confidence ; and reforming the judiciary so that ordinary @entity1 families believe in the justice system , he said			1
" we 've got the opportunity for the first time in 20 years , based on @entity1 leadership and their compelling vision , to chart a way forward , " he added			0
" i think that this newfound stability and these new steps that have been made by @entity1 , that the entire world is celebrating , because it is , indeed , worth celebrating , ... has to be something that everybody has access to , " said @entity53 , in @entity0			1
" we need to make sure that women are in this human space where we are moving forward			0
" for the moment , though , @entity1 's women are relying on themselves -- and each other -- to rebuild their lives as best they can			1
