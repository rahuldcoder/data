-- two disgruntled @entity2 newlyweds have called for the dismissal of a justice of the peace who refused to marry the interracial couple , and have even been joined in their fight by the governor , who said the official 's license should be revoked			1
the removal of embattled justice of the peace @entity13 lies with the @entity15			1
but unseating a @entity2 justice of the peace is n't easy			1
@entity18 and @entity17 -- who are now married -- stepped into the national spotlight when @entity13 , a justice of the peace for @entity21 's 8th @entity20 , refused them a license			1
@entity24 told @entity26 's @entity25 last week that he was concerned for the children who might be born of the relationship and that , in his experience , most interracial marriages do n't last			1
" i 'm not a racist , " @entity24 told the newspaper			0
" i do ceremonies for black couples right here in my house			0
my main concern is for the children			0
" despite a national uproar and a call by @entity2 gov. @entity42 for him to lose his license , @entity24 , 56 , said he has no regrets			0
" it 's kind of hard to apologize for something that you really and truly feel down in your heart you have n't done wrong , " he told @entity0 affiliate @entity45 on saturday			2
a state statute says justices of the peace may perform marriage ceremonies , but it does not require such officials to do so , @entity55 , a spokeswoman for the @entity2 attorney general , told @entity0 on monday			1
to push for @entity24 's removal , the @entity57 must look to the @entity15			1
justices of the peace in @entity2 are elected , but the state 's high court has jurisdiction over whether they can keep their jobs , @entity15 spokeswoman @entity59 said			1
the @entity66 , a judicial body independent of the @entity15 , has the power to review a case and make recommendations to the high court			1
after receiving a complaint , the @entity66 would determine whether the grievance was frivolous			2
anyone can file a complaint ; no attorney is needed , @entity74 said , though @entity78 said she has retained one			0
the commission would proceed with an investigation if there were allegations of ethical misconduct , or arguments that the justice of the peace was in violation of professional responsibility , @entity74 said			2
an investigation could take months or even a year , @entity74 said			0
and with closed - door hearings and records of investigations kept confidential , it 's hard to tell how long the average investigation lasts			0
a lawyer from the @entity97 , a branch of the commission , would prosecute the elected official , who would have an opportunity to defend himself			0
during the investigation , if the prosecutor could show the official was hindering the fair and due implementation of his job , the commission could suggest that the @entity15 enact a temporary suspension with pay			2
barring such an incident , the justice of the peace could continue to oversee cases throughout the commission 's confidential investigation			1
if the nine - member commission , by majority decision , decided the official acted unethically , it would recommend sanctions to the court			0
those recommendations and the commission 's findings would be public			2
@entity74 could not say whether @entity24 would be brought to the commission or what its decision would be			0
" it 's up to the judges to interpret the law , " she said			2
if @entity24 were brought before the commission and it decided against him , recommended sanctions could include a public censure , suspension with or without pay , or removal			0
the court , after reviewing the commission 's findings , could follow the commission 's suggestions or opt for stronger or weaker sanctions			0
or the seven - member court could decide the justice of the peace did not behave unethically , which would allow him to keep his job , @entity74 said .			1

state statute does n't require justices of peace to perform marriage ceremonies
power to oust justice of the peace rests with @entity15
@entity66 would make recommendations to the court
