-- sometimes it takes just one			0
one person -- one idea -- to ignite a movement that changes lives			0
helping the millions of people who 've fled the war in @entity8 may seem a challenge far too big for small relief efforts			1
the @entity11 calls it the worst humanitarian crisis in a generation			0
and yet , for some people , it 's just not an option to do nothing			0
i am not a tourist @entity22 says she refuses to be a neutral observer			2
her country , @entity25 , is taking in more @entity8 refugees than any other -- nearly 1 million at last official count -- despite its tiny size			1
the university student says it 's impossible to walk the streets of @entity32 without seeing reminders of the suffering -- some refugees searching for food , others sleeping on sidewalks			1
" we can not think somebody else will take care of it , " @entity39 says			0
" we are that somebody			0
each and every one of us is that somebody and it is our duty towards one another to be caring and compassionate souls			0
" @entity39 started a group called i am not a tourist			1
the name was meant as a wake - up call to her fellow @entity25 -- that the @entity8 crisis was now on their doorstep and they could no longer act like bystanders			1
she could n't stand the thought of @entity8 refugees shivering in brutally cold temperatures while she and her friends were sleeping in their warm beds			1
they began collecting winter clothing and blankets for refugees in @entity70 and the @entity71 in north @entity25			1
@entity39 estimates 4,500 people donated items , filling 25 huge trucks			0
" we ended up with more than 10,200 ' bags of love , ' " she says			1
unlike other host countries , @entity25 has no formal refugee camps			1
refugees there are scattered across some 1,600 locations , complicating aid distribution			2
@entity39 partnered with established ngos to help with logistics : sawa for @entity8 and @entity88			1
the @entity11 estimates nearly 2.5 million @entity8 are seeking shelter in @entity25 and in other neighboring states , but that accounts for only registered refugees			1
the true number could be much higher			0
and the crisis is only getting worse , as thousands of @entity8 flee across the border each day			1
sweaters for @entity8 @entity97 was half a world away when she felt compelled to help			1
it all started with a conversation with her brother			0
an @entity104 citizen living in @entity105 , @entity97 has @entity8 parents and family in @entity32			1
her brother was heading to @entity32 and asked if she had any old sweaters that he could take for a @entity11 relief effort			1
she said sure -- and then realized she could do something even bigger			0
she sent an e-mail to work colleagues , asking if they had any sweaters to contribute			0
the note touched her boss , who called her and said he wanted to help start a campaign and that he would pay for shipping the sweaters			0
it became known as sweaters for @entity8			1
@entity97 says she was overwhelmed by the response			0
she was worried that they would n't receive enough donations to fill even one container , but " in two weeks , we pretty much filled the @entity125 's warehouse with 1,000 bags			2
" the campaign inspired people across @entity105			2
one 6 - year - old boy is said to have collected 600 sweaters on his own			2
" when people know there 's something tangible that they can do to make a difference , they 'll do it , " @entity97 says			2
she cried when she saw all the bags piled up in the warehouse -- 100,000 sweaters in all			2
" everyone was so generous and they cared as much as i did , and they 're not even @entity8 , " she says			2
" the bags were delivered to the @entity146 for distribution in @entity148 and @entity149			2
@entity97 visited @entity149 this month , helping to hand out sweaters to refugees who were crossing the border			2
she also visited @entity153 , a sprawling camp in the desert now home to nearly 125,000 refugees			0
that effectively makes it one of the largest cities in @entity149 , and one of the largest refugee camps in the world			0
life is harsh there , a far cry from the comforts of home refugees left in @entity8			1
the war does n't discriminate -- people from all walks of life have been forced to leave behind virtually everything they own			0
@entity97 says she wants the world to understand that " the people in those camps are just like you and me			0
" @entity39 also stresses that point			0
she says @entity8 refugees are just normal people -- from doctors to pharmacists to teachers -- with normal lives before the war tore their world apart			1
you can do something too major aid agencies like @entity146 are overwhelmed with the sheer scale of this crisis , so grassroots efforts can play an important role in filling the gaps			2
aid organizations also encourage groups to raise cash donations , as they provide the flexibility to meet particular needs by trained relief workers			0
in all of these ways , individual efforts can make a difference in the face of enormous suffering			1
it starts with a simple idea -- and the willingness to act			0
you too can make an impact for @entity8 refugees go to @entity0 / impact for large and small ways to help .			1
