chief editor of the privately - owned @entity12 newspaper after he was attacked on friday			0
on january 8 , a prominent journalist who had been critical of the government was shot and killed by unknown assailants on the outskirts of @entity17			1
his death came days after masked gunmen besieged a privately owned television station and destroyed its equipment ; and in another attack in january , a newspaper editor and his wife were stabbed on their way to work			2
while @entity4 authorities have denied any government involvement , the cases have prompted international criticism of @entity4 over the safety of journalists			1
there are also questions about press freedoms			0
" as the [ president ] @entity40 government ramps up the war against the @entity42 , there 's been growing criticism of the government and at times it 's been partisan -- partisan journalists -- but basically in the last year and a half we have most likely seen five or six senior journalists either thrown in jail , threatened or gone into exile because of disagreements with the government , " said @entity35 , @entity36 program coordinator of the journalism watchdog group @entity37 ( @entity37 )			1
@entity40 has condemned the violence against journalists and promised thorough investigations			2
@entity35 said attacks against journalists are not new in the nation , whose government has been battling ethnic @entity42 rebels -- known as the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) -- since the 1980s			1
the conflict has claimed more than 65,000 lives			0
sixteen journalists have been killed in @entity4 since 1992 , and three journalists were imprisoned , including one on terrorism charges , in 2008 , according to @entity37			1
the group said many journalists also have faced threats and intimidation			2
as the civil conflict first unfolded , minority @entity42 journalists were targeted , but pressure against the media has gradually fallen upon mainstream news organizations , including those from the majority @entity78 ethnic group , @entity35 said in a telephone interview			1
" what we 're seeing in the last year and a half is a change in tactics from the government of just putting pressure on @entity42 journalists to putting the pressure on mainline @entity78 or @entity89 journalists who write for more legitimate papers or news outlets and are critical of the government , " he said			2
the allegations come as @entity4 's government said it was close to defeating the @entity61 rebels , who have been fighting for an independent homeland in the @entity98 nation			1
@entity40 has given assurances that no journalist or media institution has reason to fear any threats or attacks by the government			1
in a statement posted to the @entity109 web site on january 15 , the president said : " the government had no interest whatever in seeking disgrace through any attacks on the media			1
" " the president said that at a time when the government was at the very height of its popularity due to the success of the offensive against terrorism , it had no interest in losing this public acceptance by even an iota , by attacks on the media as had taken place , " the statement said			1
still , many journalists say they feel threatened			0
the web site for the @entity109 has named journalists who officials consider to be traitors , @entity35 said			0
@entity132 , editor of a citizen journalism web site groundviews.org and a senior researcher at the @entity136 , said the government " through inaction or through complicity " has allowed for an environment where violence against journalists can grow with impunity			0
people are worried , " @entity132 said			0
" nobody wants to be killed , nobody wants to be incarcerated , nobody wants to leave a country which is home			0
" police are investigating the three recent attacks on journalists but no arrests have been made , @entity149 , @entity4 's director of policy research and information in the @entity151 , told @entity0 in a telephone interview			1
the @entity158 ambassador to @entity4 , @entity159 , is among those who have expressed concern over the attacks			2
@entity159 said , " we have called on the government of @entity4 to investigate these attacks expeditiously			1
" " it 's difficult to speculate about what 's behind all this , but i think what 's important for the government to focus on now is what they can do to address this problem of impunity , whereby no one has been brought to justice for the many high profile killings -- not just of journalists but many other people -- for the many abductions that have occurred and other human rights abuses that have occurred			2
" @entity149 told @entity0 there " is no government policy of impunity			0
" he also noted : " i can categorically tell you that there is no restriction on the media , there is no censorship in our country			0
" in his final editorial before he was gunned down on january 8 , @entity192 , editor - in - chief of the @entity193 , predicted his own death in a posthumously published column and pointed the finger at the government			0
" it is well known that i was on two occasions brutally assaulted , while on another my house was sprayed with machine - gun fire			0
despite the government 's sanctimonious assurances , there was never a serious police inquiry into the perpetrators of these attacks , and the attackers were never apprehended , " he wrote in the column titled , " @entity211			0
" many fear this case will never be solved .			0
