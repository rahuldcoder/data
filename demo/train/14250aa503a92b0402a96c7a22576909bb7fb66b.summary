@entity1 says he wanted to reclaim civil rights ' from politics ' the controversy : time and location			1
people filled the park by the @entity4 's reflecting pool , in the shadows and echoes of the most pivotal civil rights address in @entity6 's history			1
some of those who marched with @entity20 in the 1960s said @entity1 had usurped the day for his own political gain			1
the rev. @entity69 told @entity0 that @entity1 was mimicking @entity20 and " humiliating the tradition			2
" @entity1 said the site of his rally was appropriate to reflect on the legacy of @entity20 , " the man who stood down on those stairs and gave his life for everyone 's right to have a dream			1
" he also said he was unaware that the rally coincided with the @entity20 anniversary when he scheduled the event			2
@entity83 , a niece of the late civil rights leader , participated in the " @entity87 " rally , saying that her uncle would have approved of the event			1
@entity1 talks faith in rally coinciding with anniversary of @entity20 's speech @entity1 also came under fire for some of his previous statements , such as his 2009 remark that president @entity101 " has a deep - seated hatred for white people or the white culture			1
" in his @entity40 interview , taped after saturday 's rally , he said he regretted his remarks about @entity101 , but said the first @entity107 - @entity6 president 's worldview was shaped by " @entity108 disguised as religion			2

speakers insisted that @entity20 's vision for @entity6 has not been completely fulfilled			0
" do n't let anyone tell you that they have the right to take their country back			2
it 's our country , too , " said @entity132 , executive director of the @entity133 , making a reference to the @entity136 members attending the @entity1 rally			1
" we will reclaim the dream			0
it was ours from the beginning			0
a dream that we will make reality , " she said			0
rally aims to ' @entity112 ' the crowd size : @entity148			2
estimates of the crowd size range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of people			0
the @entity152 no longer makes estimates , so there are no official estimates of events on the @entity157			0
@entity158 commissioned a crowd estimate by the company @entity160			0
the network reported that @entity162 estimated the crowd at 87,000 people			0
but they noted that with a margin of error of 9,000 , " between 78,000 and 96,000 attended the rally			2
" @entity169 : photo gallery of faces in the crowd @entity173 estimated the number of people in attendance as " tens , perhaps hundreds of thousands			0
" @entity40 , citing organizers , aired a banner characterizing it this way : " crowd attending beck rally estimated at over 500,000			0
" the @entity181 quoted @entity182 rep. @entity182 of @entity183 as saying , " we 're not going to let anyone get away with saying there were less than a million here today -- because we were witnesses			0
" on the morning after the rally , @entity1 himself told @entity40 sunday that he believed the crowd was between 300,000 and 650,000			1
so how many people were really there ? in the end , most people will believe what their own eyes tell them			0
the one estimate guaranteed to be correct was @entity1 's own comment making fun of the inevitable controversy : " i have just gotten word from the media that there are over 1,000 people here today			2
" wildly conflicting reports filed about @entity1 rally crowd size the impact : to be determined			1
@entity1 's speech oozed religious language and evoked the feel of a religious revival			2
@entity1 has also begun organizing top conservative religious leaders -- mostly evangelicals -- into a fledgling group called the @entity213			2
is he a new leader for @entity216 conservatives ? maybe			0
@entity1 's emerging role as a national leader for @entity216 conservatives is surprising not only because he has until recently stressed a libertarian ideology that is sometimes at odds with so - called family values conservatism , but also because @entity1 is a @entity223			1
many of the evangelicals whom @entity1 is speaking to and organizing do n't believe he is a @entity216			2
mormons , who are members of @entity228 , call themselves @entity216			0
some evangelicals criticized @entity216 for partnering with @entity1 this weekend because of his @entity223 faith , provoking a number of evangelical political activists to pen defenses of their decision to join @entity1			1

zero desire , " @entity1 told @entity40			2
" i do n't think that i would be electable			0
