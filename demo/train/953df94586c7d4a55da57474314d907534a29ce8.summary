@entity0 -- @entity2 enacted a $ 300 billion farm bill thursday over president @entity5 's objections , but questions remain about whether a clerical error will keep the bill from going into effect			1
@entity2 voted to override president @entity5 's veto of a $ 300 billion farm bill			1
the @entity12 voted 82 - 13 to override the president 's veto of the bill thursday , a day after the @entity16 voted 316 - 108 to override the veto			1
both override votes exceeded the two - thirds majority required by the @entity20			0
a portion of the bill , however , remains in legal limbo			2
before the @entity16 override vote wednesday night , lawmakers discovered that the version sent to the @entity16 last week was missing a part			2
the discovery raises questions about whether that section of the bill , which dealt with authorized trade and food aid , would become law			2
the discovery of the missing section , " @entity37 , " prompted concerns from @entity16 @entity39 that the override vote was improper			0
@entity40 said the matter stemmed from a clerical error			0
but @entity39 pounced on the " fiasco , " which they said would require a temporary extension of the current farm bill			1
" what 's happened here raises serious constitutional questions -- very serious , " said minority leader @entity46 , @entity47			0
" i do n't see how we can proceed with the override as it occurred			0
" however , house speaker @entity54 said thursday that the override votes in both chambers of @entity2 would allow the sections of the bill that were sent to the president to become law			1
" so , the farm bill minus @entity62 would be enacted " after the override votes , @entity54 said			1
" but i 'm optimistic that we will be able to get @entity62 as well , either on its own or by sending the full bill again			0
" " obviously , we want the complete bill			0
but ... we have obviously consulted with those who are expert on the @entity20 and congressional action and presidential signatures , vetoes and overrides			0
" in order to start the process of @entity62 to become law , the @entity16 passed the entire farm bill again thursday by a vote of 306 - 110			1
it is unclear what the @entity12 will do			0
it could pass the entire bill again , as the @entity16 did , or it could pass the portion not sent to the president as a free - standing bill			2
two - thirds of the $ 300 billion in spending for the farm bill would go for nutrition programs such as food stamps			1
another $ 40 billion would go toward farm subsidies , and $ 30 billion is allocated for payments to farms to keep land idle and other environmental programs			0
after vetoing the farm bill , @entity5 said it " continues subsidies for the wealthy and increases farm - bill spending by more than $ 20 billion , while using budget gimmicks to hide much of the increase			1
" the president said it would hurt efforts to improve @entity105 farmers ' access to overseas markets			2
@entity2 has passed one bill over @entity5 's objections : a $ 23 billion water - project legislation that the president vetoed in 2007			1
@entity1 's @entity110 and @entity111 contributed to this report .			0

new : @entity2 enacts most of farm bill over @entity5 's objections
new : portions of bill sent to the president are now law , @entity54 says
section of farm bill left out in version sent to president @entity5
@entity5 vetoed bill because he says it 's too *generous* to wealthy farmers
