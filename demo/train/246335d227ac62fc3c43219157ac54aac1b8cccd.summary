@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 spends most of his workday much like he starts it : swallowed in darkness			1
first by the morning , and later by the sea			1
awake at 3:30 a.m. , @entity7 heads first to the @entity1 , @entity2 , outpost of @entity9 for a @entity11 creme , small - town pleasantries and precisely the amount of coffee you would expect for a witching hour wake - up call			1
then , it 's an hour drive to the coastal community of @entity20 and his floating " office , " the @entity24			2
" you 're going to want to sit down , " @entity0 says when a wave swallows the vessel 's bow as it makes its way well into @entity2 's @entity29			1
the november @entity24 tows a rickety 20 - foot fishing boat close behind			2
the sun starts to tease its light over the horizon , but on a merciless december morning , its warm rays are an empty promise			2
as a sea urchin diver , this is @entity7 's version of a nine - to - five for the 38 - day winter diving season			1
equipped with a refashioned gardening tool and a mesh catch bag , he descends into the icy depths to rake for the area 's prized green urchin			1
" my job is sometimes the easiest job in the world and sometimes my job is the most difficult job in the world , " @entity0 says			2
the day 's end goal is the urchin 's inner roe , commonly referred to as uni			1
more technically speaking , the yellow - orange delicacy is the animal 's gonads , but the marketing choice is clear			0
@entity57 is buttery and briny , with a custard - like texture			0
it 's often described as " an acquired taste , " flavored distinctively of the sea , which is perhaps one of its most desirable traits ; there 's nothing else quite like it			1
above water , @entity0 's right - hand man , @entity67 , navigates the smaller boat with precision as a cigarette dangles from his mouth			0
his job is to look for bubbles or flippers as a sign of @entity7 ; once spotted , he tosses a second bag in @entity7 's general direction and hoists up the first			0
soon , he 's methodically measuring each urchin from the first net and throwing back any animals that are less than 2 1/16 - inch wide for a good yield of roe ( measured by a ratio of gonad to whole urchin weight )			1
the domestic urchin industry has seen a steady uptick in the past few years as the @entity91 palate wants new , now , next			1
recently , it has become a darling of the growing gastronomy scene , often cited with the same reverence as hot ticket ( and high - priced ) items like foie gras , truffles and monkfish liver			0
but the industry has reached a crossroads as conservation efforts have kept the delicacy virtually off limits to new divers			1
" most @entity91 get bored with food real easily , so this is a new and hot item that is unique in taste and texture , " @entity0 says			0
the industry , however , was n't initially fueled by stateside demand , but rather by the @entity114			1
" when i was a kid we had a cereal made of uni , " @entity0 jokes			1
" no , i never saw an urchin until i was two years out of high school			2
" @entity114 - born @entity120 , who is now based in @entity121 , @entity2 , was one of the first to crack the potential of the eerie - looking echinoderms			1
he moved to @entity121 shortly after graduating from the @entity124 -- " no urchin there , " he jokes -- to help a friend open the town 's first @entity114 restaurant			0
by 1989 , he had established @entity129 , and started shipping @entity2 's best known seafood , the lobster , to his home country			1
" the lobster fishermen kept asking me if there was a market for sea urchin because they were getting a lot of them in the traps , " @entity120 said			2
growing up , he knew the sweet roe was a hot commodity in his community			2
he also knew that around @entity144 , when urchins were not in season for @entity114 , they were in @entity2			1
when @entity0 started diving in 1992 , 100 % of the fished urchins were exported to @entity114			2
now , only 20 % are shipped abroad while the other 80 % are shipped domestically , @entity120 says			0
" we started out diving for 25 cents an urchin			0
when i got 35 cents a pound , i thought i was going to get rich			0
then , it hit a dollar a pound and we all celebrated -- and then it hit $ 2 a pound , " @entity0 says , adding that in recent years , the price has gone as high as $ 7.60 a pound			1
but with added demand comes the glut of potential harvesters			2
by 1994 , there were 1,700 urchin diving licenses ( plus 1,000 dragger licenses ) issued in the state , according to @entity165 , a biologist at the @entity166 of @entity167			0
@entity168 , along with @entity7 and @entity120 , serves on the @entity169 , which was created to address concerns of depletion at the height of the urchin explosion in the early 1990s			0
the council ultimately divided the region into two zones , with a 15 - day season for @entity178 divers and a 38 - day season for @entity179			0
in @entity179 , @entity7 is permitted to fill up only seven bins weighing 600 pounds total per day , and dive monday through wednesday			0
the council also imposed a moratorium on licenses			0
as of 2013 , there were 37 active divers in @entity178 and 77 active divers in @entity179 ; with the average ages at 49 and 46 years old , respectively			2
" and that 's pretty old for a diver , " @entity168 says			0
those divers , like @entity7 , are at a delicate crossroads where they 're going to need new people to start learning the ropes without compromising their conservation efforts			1
@entity168 says the department does a survey dive every spring to inform their evaluation on licensing			0
as @entity0 's head surfaces above the water back in the bay , he does n't betray any inner turmoil about his profession 's sink or swim moment			0
" there 's nowhere else that i can think of that you 're going to escape cell phones and noise , " @entity0 says .			0

the domestic *popularity* of sea urchins has grown considerably in recent years
@entity2 is *grappling* with the demand and conservation efforts
urchins are wanted at restaurants for their prized roe , called uni
