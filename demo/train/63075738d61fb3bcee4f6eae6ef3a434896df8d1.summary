-- all the talk of phone - hacking this summer has brought the thorny issue of mobile device security to the forefront of the news agenda			1
but even the most scurrilous hack of @entity8 would be amazed at the talents of the some of the dedicated hackers of cyberspace , who are now targeting mobile devices with great audacity			0
iphones , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity20 7 phones and @entity22 users routinely use shared networks in public places , which leaves them all susceptible to infiltration			1
unless these networks have been properly secured , freely available browser add - ons and apps can help hackers seize control of personal data at the touch of a button			1
meanwhile so - called " drive - by download " attacks lie invisibly in wait on web - pages or in malicious emails then compromise the machine of anyone unfortunate enough to visit			1
it means that the person using a laptop in a coffee shop may look like they are just checking their @entity47 page , but they might just as easily be accessing yours			0
they could also be flicking through your contacts book , copying your email , or seizing your online banking details			0
at @entity59 , a recent security conference in @entity55 , a talk by @entity57 , the founder of the computer security consultancy @entity58 , carried the teaser : " they watch you sleep , they watch you work , they hold all your personal and professional data , and they sacrifice security for performance and usability			1
your mobile devices present attackers with a 24/7 threat surface ( and do n't think the hackers have n't noticed )			2
" none of the most popular devices are immune			0
in 2009 , for instance , a hack resulted in 145,000 @entity78 users having their email forwarded to servers in the @entity81			0
@entity57 also described an attack on the network of an airport in @entity85 , which threatened anyone using @entity87 in the terminal			0
@entity57 showed a battery charger that had been modified to serve as a hacking device , and even spoke of an attack to @entity92 and @entity17 users that came through malicious coding attached to bonus levels of @entity96			1
according to a recent report , the success of @entity99 's @entity22 operating system has resulted in a 400 % increase in @entity22 - specific malware since 2010			1
furthermore a commonly distributed app for @entity22 called @entity104 actually makes hacking possible through the handset itself			1
after a simple download , a @entity104 user can hijack any number of social media profiles over a @entity112 connection in a process that takes less than two minutes			1
" your @entity47 or @entity116 account could be hijacked with someone using little more than a cheap second - hand phone from @entity120 , " said information security professional @entity114			1
for all the exceptional sophistication of attacks on mobile devices , however , sometimes the greatest risks to data leakage remain the most prosaic			2
" we 've seen executives leave laptops on buses or in the back of taxis , " said @entity126 , a manager in @entity129 's security and resilience team			2
" what they 're doing now is potentially leaving their mobile device behind , and those devices now can carry just as much data as the laptop did			2
" @entity126 advises businesses on the specific challenges encountered when an executive buys a smart phone or an @entity17 and begins using it for business as well as pleasure			1
companies will usually have tightly managed internal networks , with firewalls , encryption , etc. for ensuring security of their data			0
but once executives begin using their own device , and accessing networks elsewhere , the threats multiply significantly			0
a recent @entity161 study , for instance , found that only around 6 % of mobile devices have even basic anti-virus software installed			0
" typically users have n't learned to regard their mobile devices as the same risk , " @entity126 said			2
in addition to the simple education of users , @entity126 advises businesses to develop clear policies governing user - owned devices to avoid difficult confrontations with staff if a device is lost , stolen or compromised			2
" if users use a device that contains their personal phone book and treasured photos , and that device also contains sensitive business data , who gets the call on whether the whole of that device is erased ? " he said			1
" that 's quite a tricky question in hindsight unless you 've addressed it			0
" security experts have touted the idea of " split personality " phones , with an inbuilt division between personal and business data			1
@entity126 also ran through the pros and cons of mobile device management software , such as @entity198 , which allow businesses to keep a permanent inventory and track their registered handsets			0
such systems can manage passwords and encryptions , and even cut down on expenses by finding the best roaming charges for devices overseas			0
however some employees may feel that their privacy is jeopardized by software that essentially tracks their movement across the globe			0
" it is a significant but manageable problem , " said @entity126 , adding that businesses are slowly beginning to talk more seriously about the key issues			0
" i just hope we do n't see too many major security breaches caused by a failure to manage or use mobile devices properly			2

drive - by download attacks can come from *mallicious* emails or web pages
an @entity22 app can turn a smart phone into a hacking device within minutes
personal information can then be a risk
information security experts say many do n't see smart phones as at risk
