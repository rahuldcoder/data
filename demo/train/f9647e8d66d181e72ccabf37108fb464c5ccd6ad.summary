@entity3 keeps in his cabin a memento of the last time the storied @entity7 destroyer cruised into @entity8			1
sailors stood at the rails under a fluttering @entity14 flag			1
in the background , the @entity15 soared over a shimmering skyline			1
" it reminds me of why we go to sea , " @entity18 says of the keepsake photo			1
a few months later , on october 12 , 2000 , a pair of suicide bombers associated with @entity25 nearly sank the @entity26 as it refueled in @entity28 harbor in @entity29			1
the attackers waved at the sailors			1
" it was presumed to be a trash boat , " @entity18 says			2
" resilient and strong the bombers sidled their explosives - laden fishing boat alongside the $ 1 billion warship and ripped a 40 - by - 60 - foot hole into its side , killing 17 sailors and wounding 37 more			1
heralded by @entity25 as one of its greatest military strikes , the attack foreshadowed the terror network 's destruction of the @entity15 in @entity48 less than a year later			1
" we took a hit 11 months before 9/11 , and we came back resilient , a strong force , " @entity18 says , " like the men and women of @entity0			1
" the destroyer -- also known as @entity26 -- left @entity0 on tuesday at the close of @entity10 2014			1
the @entity15 site , with its hulking @entity57 , once again houses the nation 's tallest building			1
on wednesday , the same day the @entity26 headed the @entity10 procession along the harbor , the long - awaited september 11 @entity62 opened to the public			2
a flotilla of smaller vessels , including @entity66 and @entity68 boats , welcomed the ships			2
" we 're so closely connected to the men and women of @entity0 , " says @entity18 , a native of @entity70 , @entity71			1
" you see the outpouring of the emergency service members , the firefighters and the @entity66			2
" in recent days , hundreds of schoolchildren and adults toured the @entity26 to learn about its history , weapons systems and return to duty two years and $ 250 million in repairs and upgrades after the attack			2
" right here is where the gash was , " says @entity7 @entity88 of @entity89 , @entity90 , standing near where 17 sailors having an early lunch were killed			1
victims remembered nearby , in the ship 's @entity98 , 17 gold stars are inlaid on the mess deck to commemorate each victim			1
" the sailors , you watch them when they 're getting their chow , they do n't step on those stars , " @entity18 says			1
" they walk around them			2
and sailors are assigned to clean those stars every day			1
they take that very seriously			2
" each victim is remembered on a plaque : -- @entity115 2nd @entity114 , 21			2
-- electronics technician chief petty officer @entity116 , 35			2
-- @entity118 @entity117 , 19			2
-- information systems technician @entity119 , 21			2

in addition , placards with photos and short biographies about the victims are displayed near their workstations			0
" every single day you remember what those sailors died for , " @entity88 says			1
in the dining hall , the attack is commemorated with three glass cases			0
one has the still blackened flag that flew the day of the attack			0
another , the flag that draped the coffins of the fallen crew members			0
a third holds the flag flown when the ship first returned to the @entity157			0
courage and heroism in 2001 , the @entity160 issued a report on the @entity26 attack that cited significant shortcomings in security against terrorist attacks			0
" the investigation clearly shows that the commanding officer of @entity26 did not have the specific intelligence , focused training , appropriate equipment or on - scene security support to effectively prevent or deter such a determined , preplanned assault , " the @entity166 , adm. @entity167 , said at the time			1
" in short , the system -- all of us -- did not equip this @entity177 for success in the environment he encountered in @entity28 harbor that fateful day			0
" the terror organization 's success against the @entity26 " galvanized @entity25 's recruitment efforts , " while the failure of the @entity14 to retaliate against group leaders in @entity187 motivated @entity189 to " launch something bigger , " said the @entity181			1
still , those stationed on the @entity26 speak of the heroism of members of the former crew , who worked for days to save the ship and care for the injured			0
in intense heat , they toiled without electrical power and no shipboard communication			0
" on two occasions , it was very , very close to sinking , " @entity18 says			0
" the ship had to pull together everybody regardless of what their specialty was ... for damage control			0
" he added , " there is no question that this ship was saved by the men and women who were serving on the @entity26 in october 2000			1
that 's not lost on me or any of my crew members			1
we stand on the shoulders of those who came before us			1
" all @entity7 recruits now undergo drills on the same type of ship as the @entity26 , putting out fires , dealing with flooding and tending to the wounded			1
exercises occur in a structural model of the damaged @entity26 mess deck			0
" we have a totally different mindset of how we do business , a totally different focus , " @entity18 says			0
said @entity88 , " there 's not really a drill that you can do for something that massive			1
even when you have an actual fire or flooding , it 's not nearly that bad			1
it would have taken a lot of courage and heroism to do what they did			0

storied @entity7 destroyer visits @entity0 for first time since 2000 suicide bombing
@entity25 operation killed 17 sailors and wounded 37 more in @entity29 port
eleven months later , @entity25 destroys @entity0 's @entity15
