@entity0 -- the rock band @entity2 have created music history on both sides of the @entity5 with the release of their new album " 13			1
" the record has provided the band with their first number one album in the @entity12 and their first album chart topper in the @entity14 after an unprecedented 43 years			1
they have achieved the landmark by returning to their roots			2
it 's the band 's first album for more than three decades featuring vocalist @entity21 along with fellow original band members guitarist @entity22 and bass player @entity23			1
they credit producer @entity25 with helping them overcome their initial apprehension			0
" he was really good for us " , says @entity23 " and suggested we go back to the old spirit of how we used to do things like live in the studio , a jam , live in the studio kind of feel			0
and that gave us the direction to go in			0
" " we tried it in 2001 " adds @entity21 " and i think unconsciously we knew this was our last chance			1
if we had failed on this attempt people would have said ' ah it 's never gon na happen			2
' i think it must be over 30 or 40 years since i listened to the first album because you know you move on and you challenge yourself			1
as i was saying earlier on , it 's like asking the @entity49 to go back to ' @entity50 ' and they would have gone ' what ? ' " that first album was recorded in just two days in the @entity53 city of @entity54 in 1969			1
the band 's name was inspired by seeing people queuing to see a horror movie at a cinema in the city			2
@entity21 recalls : " @entity2 was an after - thought cos originally we were a blues jazz band and someone said ' people pay money to see horror movies and get scared , why do n't we start writing scary music ? ' " playing scary music produced a legacy that has influenced generations of rock bands and labeled @entity2 as godfathers of heavy metal			1
but the band has an uneasy relationship with their musical offspring			0
" i have never ever ever been able to attach myself to the word ' heavy metal ' -- it has no musical connotations , " @entity21 says			1
" if it was heavy rock i could get that but the 70s was kind of like a bluesy thing , the 80s was kind of bubblegum - frosted hair , multicolored clothes and the 90s was kind of grungy			2
people come up to me and say ' your sabbath work was a big influence on me			0
' i could go ' oh yeah i can see that ' but other bands ... what part of that is inspired by us ? some of it is just angry people screaming down a microphone ! " the band had to overcome several obstacles to complete the new album			2
original drummer @entity104 was replaced by @entity106 's @entity105 on the new album after a contractual dispute			1
and @entity22 was diagnosed with cancer			0
" if it was me i 'd just go " i 'm out of here " says @entity21 " but he never complained once , he just kept it to himself , i 'd be thinking this is the end if it was me			1
i did n't know if anyone could beat cancer			0
" " he was an inspiration to us during the album " adds @entity23			0
" nothing would stand in his way			0
he just got on with it and through it and i thought if he can do that then i can do that so we persevered with it			0
" @entity21 recently apologized to his band mates and wife @entity132 after admitting he 'd relapsed into a cycle of drink and drugs			1
but he says he 's been sober now for four months and ready to take the album on the road			2
they say the touring experience now is very different to their wildest days			0
" it 's great " says @entity21			1
" i do n't go to clubs or bars , i stay in my room			0
" " do the gig then go to bed ! " laughs @entity23			0
man had not long since set foot on the moon when @entity2 had their first number one album in the @entity14			1
it took a record - breaking interval of 42 years and eight months to repeat the feat. at times it may have felt like @entity156 for the band but in the words of one of their album 's stand - out tracks it may in fact be merely the " @entity163			1
" @entity21 ends in reflective mood			2
" @entity2 was n't some band created by a @entity0 mogul			2
we were four guys who had a dream that became bigger than expectations			0
it 's been the best thing that ever happened to me			0

@entity2 creates history with the release of their new album " 13 "
record is their first *no.* 1 album in @entity12 , first @entity14 chart topper in 43 years
@entity182 @entity21 says " this was our last chance " to return to their roots
@entity21 says he 's *uncomfortable* with legacy as godfather of heavy metal
