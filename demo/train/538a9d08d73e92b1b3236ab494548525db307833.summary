the 89 - year - old @entity0 broke the sound barrier in a @entity9 @entity8 f - 15 at 10:24 a.m. over the @entity10 , the same location where he first flew past @entity12 on october 14 , 1947 , the military said in a statement			1
@entity0 , flying in the @entity7 with an @entity8 captain , told @entity15 late sunday that he hit @entity16 and " laid down a pretty good sonic boom over @entity19 " @entity18			1

today , fighter jets can easily break the sound barrier			2
in fact , @entity0 's flight sunday did it at an altitude of about 33,000 feet , according to a statement provided by the @entity8			2
but in 1947 , the golden age of flight , @entity0 was dropped in an experimental rocket - propelled @entity51 jet from a b - 29 bomber at an altitude of 45,000 feet			1
" that 's the only way we could do it , " he said			0
" it took the @entity59 , @entity60 and the @entity61 another five years to find out that trick			0
it gave us a quantum jump " in aviation advancement , he said			0
on sunday , @entity0 took off from @entity67 near @entity68 in the second seat , the one behind the pilot , though he said he was flying the @entity7 when it broke the sound barrier over @entity19			1
" we had to keep it below @entity73			0
if you want to go @entity75 , you start breaking glasses and cracking roofs , " he said			0
but @entity0 hardly sounded disappointed			0
his final aerial move , he told @entity15 , was a fly - by , buzzing the tower , at @entity67 .			0
