-- the immigration debate took center stage thursday as @entity4 president @entity3 fielded questions in a forum broadcast live online by the @entity9 - language @entity8 network			1
" i want you to acknowledge that you did not keep your promise , " co-host @entity10 said in @entity9 , noting that the president did n't deliver on his 2008 campaign pledge to push immigration reform during the first year of his term			1
@entity3 said the first year of his term was consumed by efforts to help the economy and stop the country from going into another @entity20			1
and @entity22 political opponents , he said , kept many significant immigration measures from getting off the ground			2
for immigrants , ' deferred status ' still means no federal health insurance " i am happy to take responsibility for the fact that we did n't get it done , " @entity3 said			2
" but i did not make a promise that i would get everything done 100 % when i was elected as president			2
what i promised was that i would work every single day as hard as i can to make sure that everybody in this country regardless of who they are , what they look like , where they come from , that they would have a fair shot at the @entity4 dream			0
and that promise i 've kept			0
" asked whether his move this summer to halt deportations of some children of illegal immigrants was politically motivated by a desire to win the @entity52 vote , @entity3 said , " i think if you look at the polls , i was winning the @entity52 vote before that			1
" i did this because i met young people all across the country , wonderful kids who sometimes were valedictorians , were participating in the community , had aspirations to go to college , some were serving in our military			0
... there 's no way you would think it was fair or just for us to have them suffering under a cloud of deportation , " he said			0
after answering a series of @entity9 questions about topics ranging from teacher strikes to @entity80 's drug war , @entity3 brought up the topic again at the end of the forum			1
asked by @entity10 to identify his biggest failure , @entity3 offered a quick response			2
" @entity10 , as you remind me , my biggest failure is that we have n't gotten comprehensive immigration reform done , " he said			1
" but it 's not for lack of trying or desire			2
" the hourlong forum , co-sponsored by @entity94 , was broadcast live online in @entity9 and @entity96 on thursday afternoon and was scheduled to air on @entity8 later thursday night			2
on the campaign trail , both @entity3 and @entity22 challenger gov. @entity98 have discussed immigration in their efforts to woo @entity52 voters , considered a key demographic in the november election			1
@entity3 handily won the @entity52 vote in 2008 over @entity107 sen. @entity107 , and recent polls have showed @entity3 leading @entity98 among @entity52 registered voters			1
@entity98 steps up effort to woo @entity52 voters in @entity8 forum the @entity112 weekly tracking poll reported monday that @entity3 held a 68 % to 26 % advantage over @entity98 among @entity52			1
a @entity116 poll conducted partially before and partially after the @entity117 at the end of august said @entity3 leads @entity98 among latino registered voters 64 % to 27 %			1
but @entity52 leaders have criticized the president for an overall increase in deportations of undocumented immigrants in recent years			1
last year , @entity125 removed 396,906 illegal immigrants , the largest number in the agency 's history			0
some @entity52 leaders have also criticized the president for not moving quickly enough on immigration reform at the beginning of his presidency			1
@entity3 : ' i need a dance partner on immigration reform ' politicians across party lines have vowed to fix what they argue is the nation 's broken immigration system			1
but it 's unclear what shape so - called comprehensive immigration reform could take -- particularly in a politically divided @entity147			1
many immigrant rights groups have proposed creating a " path to citizenship " that would give millions of illegal immigrants an opportunity to become legal residents			0
critics have called such proposals unfair offers of amnesty to lawbreakers			0
measures aimed at dealing with the thorny issue -- including the dream act , proposed by @entity162 and backed by @entity3 -- have not gained enough support to pass @entity147 despite several attempts			2
the @entity3 administration has said its deferred action policy -- which allows people younger than 30 who arrived in the @entity4 before the age of 16 , pose no criminal or security threat , and were successful students or served in the military , to apply for a two - year deferral from deportation -- is a temporary measure aimed at addressing a problem that requires a permanent solution			2
during the primary campaign , @entity98 said he opposed the @entity180 , but also called for an unspecified @entity22 version that has yet to emerge from the party or his campaign			0
on thursday , @entity3 said he had never wavered in his support for immigration reform and criticized @entity98 's stance on the topic			1
" the issue here for voters is whose vision best represents the aspirations , not just of the @entity52 community , but of all @entity4 who believe that we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants			1
and that candidate i believe is talking to you right now , " he said as the audience at the @entity200 cheered			0
@entity98 spoke for about 35 minutes in another " meet the candidates " forum hosted by @entity8 on wednesday			0
the events come weeks after @entity10 criticized the @entity206 for not picking a @entity52 debate moderator			1
" i think that they should have noticed that this country is changing very rapidly , " @entity10 told @entity0 in august			0
" @entity211 , for instance , surpass whites in @entity4 births , and those changes simply are not reflected			0
i really ca n't believe why they did n't choose a member of a minority group to be part of at least one debate , and i really ca n't understand why ( the commission did n't pick ) a journalist from the fastest ( growing ) voting block in the country , the @entity224			0
" the bipartisan commission that organizes presidential debates announced the moderators last month			0
@entity229 ' @entity228 will host the first debate on october 3 in @entity231			0
