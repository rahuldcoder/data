-- @entity1 got aggressive in 2013 , positioning itself as the " @entity2 " and actively courting customers of other mobile providers to switch			1
according to the company , it 's working -- at least in terms of adding new customers			2
the fourth - largest mobile carrier in the @entity9 was also the fastest - growing in 2013 , adding 4.4 million customers , @entity1 said tuesday during a quarterly call with investors			1
" what a year it 's been , " ceo @entity13 said			0
" we 've been extremely busy			0
" more than 1.6 million of those new customers arrived in the last three months of the 2013 fiscal year , marking the third quarter in a row that @entity1 added more than 1 million paying users			1
but it was also the third quarter in a row that the company lost money : $ 20 million , this time			1
that reflects the money @entity1 is spending to attract new users and expand its network , as well as some of the less - expensive plans it 's offering to lure all those new customers			1
not surprisingly , @entity31 and other @entity1 brass were n't emphasizing that part on tuesday			0
instead , they cited the growth numbers again and again			0
and they do mark a turnaround from the 256,000 customers @entity1 lost in 2012			1
under @entity31 's brash leadership , the company has taken some unconventional tacks to lure business			0
in january , @entity1 offered to pay up to $ 650 towards customers ' early termination fees with other carriers if they switch			1
( of course , that was a response to @entity47 targeting @entity1 customers with a similar deal )			2
it rolled out @entity51 , a program that lets customers upgrade phones twice a year for a small monthly fee , and announced new plans that do n't require an annual contract			2
and it did n't hurt that , last march , @entity1 became an approved carrier for the @entity60 for the first time			1
" we changed the way this industry operates and customers responded , " @entity13 said			0
while acknowledging that the highest number of customer defections came from @entity47 , the @entity68 in the @entity9 , @entity1 declined to give more detailed figures			0
" we 're not trying to be too cute about where the customers are coming from , " @entity13 said			0
" that 's not something we 're going to get into anymore			0
as ( mobile carriers ) are all getting highly competitive , we 're not going to give a further road map of where they 're coming from			0
" @entity1 also expanded its 4g lte network in 2013			2
it now covers 209 million people and is in 95 of the top 100 metro areas in the @entity9 the company has plans to further expand in 2014 , eventually covering more than 250 million potential customers .			1

@entity1 added 4.4 million customers in 2013
its " @entity2 " approach targets customers of other carriers
company still lost money , though : $ 20 million last quarter
2013 saw @entity1 offer no - contract plans , add @entity60 and expand network
