-- after two years of claiming that his views were " evolving , " president @entity1 said on wednesday that he has finally reached a conclusion and supports same - sex marriage			1
@entity1 's public endorsement is an important step in the right direction , but it does not undo the fact that he has a mixed record on gay rights			1
this defining moment came only after the issue was pushed to the headlines by vice president @entity15 's open support for same - sex couples			1
when @entity1 first took office , many had high hopes			2
after all , six months in , a press release was sent out entitled : " president @entity1 @entity21			1
" it seemed like a momentous occasion , the fulfillment of a promise by the candidate who had vowed to become a " fierce advocate " of gay rights			1
instead , what followed was mostly a charade , and a very successful one			0
at the time , almost everyone thought @entity1 was extending equal rights to same - sex employees in the government			1
why would n't they ? there was a @entity38 ceremony , seen around the world , that showed the president signing some sort of impressive - sounding document regarding federal benefits and nondiscrimination			2
give the @entity1 team credit for a successful political maneuver			2
but the discrimination against same - sex federal employees did not end			1
benefits for gay federal employees are much closer to those of their heterosexual colleagues , if they are posted abroad			0
so if you want the federal government to stop discriminating , you basically have to leave the country			0
it also turned out that federal employees can not sign up their partners -- even their legally married ones -- for benefits as basic as health insurance			0
@entity1 's highly touted memorandum gives partners of same - sex federal employees the ability to apply for private long - term care insurance , with no discernible advantage over what they would find elsewhere			1
let 's be clear -- it 's not @entity1 's fault that @entity73 passed and @entity74 signed the 1996 @entity75 , which says marriage refers only to heterosexual couples			1
@entity1 has said that he opposes the legislation			2
but the @entity1 administration has gone out of its way to create an impression that it has done much more for gay people than it actually has			2
in fact , @entity1 's @entity84 actively defended the anti-gay @entity75 in court until last year			2
when @entity87 , a federal lawyer , managed a rare victory in obtaining coverage by the @entity90 for the woman she legally married , the @entity1 administration made sure the benefits would not extend to anyone else			2
in light of these contradictory -- almost deceptive -- moves by his administration , it 's no wonder that @entity1 has found himself swirling in turbulence over his wobbly position on gay rights			1
comparatively , discrimination on employee benefits is not controversial and it requires much less ammunition than fighting against other forms of discrimination			0
several years ago , two - thirds of @entity107 told @entity110 that " gay and lesbian domestic partners should have access to health insurance and other employee benefits			2
" and that was before support for gay marriage became broader			2
the president can only gain from taking a strong position against same - sex discrimination			1
it will energize his base and help him look like an advocate for fairness and not just another cynical politician			0
the people who strongly oppose equality in employee benefits would never vote for him anyway			0
everyone else would probably find it refreshing to see a politician march out of the morass of ambiguity and double - talk and for once take a clear strong position			0
ironically , @entity1 has mocked @entity136 for flip - flopping on gay rights			1
in fact , both of them have tried to play all sides of this issue , coldly calculating political advantage			0
some have thought that @entity1 's personal experience as the @entity148 - @entity107 son of a mixed - race couple would make him into a fierce advocate of equality and justice			1
instead , many in the gay community have derided him for his " cowardice			1
" but the president 's record has n't been all misses			2
he achieved an important victory when he had do n't ask , do n't tell overturned			0
but until he seemed to have no choice , he remained extraordinarily quiet on gay issues , even though he continues to collect millions of dollars in donations from gay activists			1
he has spoken out only when absolutely necessary and sometimes not even then			0
gay leaders implored @entity1 to lend support before a close vote on gay rights in @entity168			1
they blamed him partly for the loss			0
on the recent @entity171 constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage , @entity1 issued a statement against the amendment through a spokesman , and declared that he was disappointed only after it passed			1
@entity1 's claims that he cares about equality for gays have not seemed sincere			0
now that he has emphatically stated that same - sex marriage should be legal , he ought to make passage of the @entity182 a priority			1
he should take a stand personally , not through press releases and spokesmen , against discrimination			0
he should support the bill that calls for the repeal of the @entity75			0
now he should follow up his landmark statement with actions that will have practical , not just symbolic impact as country after country removes barriers to equality for gay couples , the @entity107 should take a lesson			0
same - sex marriage , one of the highest hurdles , is already recognized legally in places as different as @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 , among others			1
nondiscrimination in employee benefits is far more common , not just for reasons of fairness but also because it allows organizations to compete for the best talent			0
the decision to at long last finish the evolution and come out in support of gay marriage is a major step			0
but , mr. president , when it comes to fighting discrimination , there are principles to defend , promises to keep and miles to go before you sleep			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			0
