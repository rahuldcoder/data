@entity0 , @entity1 -- senior citizens are common in @entity1 but one 74 - year - old is in a class of her own : " @entity9 " is believed to be the oldest chimpanzee in captivity			1
born in @entity10 , she was one of the first residents at @entity13 theme park in @entity0 , @entity1 , about 20 miles west of @entity14			2
" she came here when the park opened in 1967 , " said @entity16 director @entity15 , who has been with the park just as long			0
@entity15 said the park 's owners bought her from a pet dealer			0
" it was a whole different world then , " explained @entity15			0
" chimps in pet shops that were babies at that time could go for 10 grand			0
" @entity15 does n't know how much the park 's owners paid for @entity9 , who was certainly no baby when she came to @entity13 45 years ago			1
the owners said that @entity9 was part of the @entity32 , a traveling variety show that performed on ice across the @entity35 , before she was acquired by the pet dealer , @entity15 said			2
" she was very sweet , very good with people , " recalled @entity15			0
" obviously somebody treated her nicely			0
" laboratory chimps get a new lease on life when world - renowned primatologist @entity42 visited the theme park in 1972 , @entity15 was anxious to introduce her to @entity9			1
at that time birth records for chimpanzees were not kept so @entity15 did the next best thing : he asked the expert to estimate @entity9 's age			1
@entity42 determined that the chimpanzee was between 30 and 35 years old			1
splitting the difference , the park decided to put her age at 32			0
claim of octogenarian chimp prompts questions caretakers decided to mark @entity9 's birthday each @entity58 , since she has a sweet tooth : cakes , pies and sodas are among her favorite foods			1
she may be the oldest chimpanzee in captivity but she does not look her age when compared to other chimpanzees			2
@entity9 is petite , weighing about 100 pounds , and the only physical indication of her age are the gray hairs on her chin			1
" look at @entity72 , " said @entity15 referring to the chimpanzee in the cage next to @entity9			2
" @entity72 probably looks to you , after seeing some other chimps , like he 's 900 years old ( but ) he 's 35			1
" @entity72 was born in @entity75 and spent his early years as a research test subject in @entity77			0
" before he was 5 years old , he had probably 70 liver biopsies and they knocked him down with some horrific drugs , " said @entity15			0
" right now he 's suffering with severe arthritis in his hips			0
" although more than twice @entity72 's age , @entity9 's last physical showed her in good health with clean lungs and a strong heart			1
@entity15 believes that excellent care in the pet industry may be the reason she is healthy at her advanced age			0
the life span for chimpanzees is 40 to 50 years in the wild and for those in captivity it is 50 to 60 years , according to the @entity97			1
when asked about @entity9 's life expectancy @entity15 responded , " i 'd like to think she will be around longer than me			2

" @entity9 " has been at @entity1 's @entity101 since 1967
five years later , renowned primatologist @entity42 helped determine her age
this year she celebrated her 74th birthday
normally , chimps live 40 to 50 years in the wild and 50 to 60 years in captivity
