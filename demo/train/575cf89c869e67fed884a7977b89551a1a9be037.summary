@entity0 , @entity1 -- countries whose top leadership meet with the @entity5 , @entity6 's exiled spiritual leader , lose on average 8.1 percent in exports to @entity1 in the two years following the meeting , according to a recent study			1
called the " @entity11 , " the study by the @entity13 in @entity14 found the negative impact on exports began when president @entity17 took office in 2002			1
the study is the first empirical analysis demonstrating the economic consequence of such meetings			0
machinery and transportation equipment exports suffered the most consistent negative impact , following meetings with the @entity26 , according to study authors @entity27 and @entity29			1
" we wanted to find out the impact of the rising role of @entity1 in the world ... to find out what we should expect of @entity1 's role in the world in the coming years , " researcher @entity27 told @entity2			1
" it is clear that politics has played a huge role in @entity1 's commercial relationships			0
" @entity1 says it opposes politicizing trade and economic ties			2
however , prior to each of the @entity5 's meetings with leaders , the @entity1 government often openly threatens that such meetings will lead to damaged trade relations with @entity1			1
using data from the @entity49 , @entity27 and @entity29 tracked exports from 159 countries doing trade with @entity1 from 1991 to 2008			1
they discovered that exports to @entity1 decreased only after the @entity5 met with heads of state , such as presidents , prime ministers , kings , queens and the @entity60			1
the @entity5 's meetings with heads of state -- including @entity64 presidents @entity62 and @entity65 , @entity14 chancellor @entity66 and @entity68 president @entity67 -- have been a consistent source of diplomatic tension with @entity1			1
no negative impact was found after meetings of the @entity5 with lower - ranking officials , the study said			1
@entity5 talks of retirement in response to the study findings , @entity77 , joint secretary for the @entity5 in @entity78 , told @entity2 : " his holiness has no intention of causing any inconvenience to the host country he visits			2
" @entity77 added , " it is unfortunate that the @entity1 government views everything his holiness does through a political angle			0
" @entity1 's @entity91 declined to comment			0
the " @entity11 " is not permanent , according to the study			2
the negative impact on exports disappeared on average two years after each meeting takes place			2
" @entity1 has an interest in having its commercial relationships restored			0
on the other hand , they have interest to really show their anger about a @entity5 reception or meeting , " @entity27 said			2
my take : why the @entity5 became a global icon the study went on to say , " @entity1 's political leadership may be willing to bear the economic and political costs that arise from diverting trade away from the @entity5 - receiving countries if such ' punishment ' increases the likelihood of its political survival			1
" the implications of decreased exports to @entity1 could hurt the @entity1 economy			2
" blocking trade endangers @entity1 economic growth , both from a immediate short - term perspective , and longer - term perspective as trade partners seek to diversify away from a potentially - aggressive @entity1 , " said @entity119 , @entity1 analyst at @entity120 , a macroeconomic research firm			2
moreover , the government may not be responsible for the negative impact on exports in the aftermath of meetings with the @entity5			1
" the possibility remains that @entity1 companies are taking it upon themselves to curb trade links , rather that it being a direct order from the highest levels , " @entity119 said			0
" as machinery tools are strongly linked to trade missions , and the government controls the trade missions , the government would appear to be in control here			0
but it could be less that the government has ordered a freeze on imports , rather than removed one easy way for companies to strike deals for those imports			0
" more than 95 percent of the @entity5 's visits to foreign countries are non-political in nature , says the @entity5 's joint secretary , but his meetings have long been the subject of intense debate in @entity0			1
when the @entity5 was awarded the @entity152 in 1989 , @entity1 threatened to sever economic ties with @entity154 if @entity154 leadership attended the ceremony			1
in february of this year , @entity64 president @entity65 met with the @entity5 in @entity157 despite warnings from @entity0			0
following the meeting , @entity1 vice-foreign minister @entity159 summoned the @entity64 ambassador to express @entity1 's discontent			0
" the @entity64 act grossly interfered in @entity1 's internal affairs , gravely hurt the @entity1 people 's national sentiments and seriously damaged the @entity1 - @entity64 ties , " said @entity164 spokesman @entity163 in a statement in february			0
the long term impact of the " @entity11 " is uncertain			0
" @entity1 trade relations are not free of political biases ... the country seems to exploit trade ties as a foreign policy tool , " @entity27 and @entity29 wrote			0
" [ however ] such an economic punishment mechanism will only prevail as long as the expected political gains from stabilizing the regime outweigh the losses from trade diversion			0

study : countries that meet with the @entity5 lose 8.1 percent in exports to @entity1
effect lasts for two years following the meeting with the exiled spiritual leader
the " @entity11 " began in 2002 when president @entity17 took office
only impacts trade if meetings are between a head of state and the @entity5
