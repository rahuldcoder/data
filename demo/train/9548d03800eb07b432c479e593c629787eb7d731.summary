-- november 29 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : @entity0 welcomes you back from @entity18 break ! hope you had a great turkey day			2
here is your commercial - free news on this last monday in november			1
first up : island attacked @entity23 : first up -- things are tense with @entity4			1
@entity26 senator @entity25 says he does n't think the @entity28 country really wants war , but that 's what it 's talking about as the @entity26 and @entity33 start military exercises off the coast of the @entity36			1
here 's @entity0 's @entity37			1
@entity38 , @entity0 pentagon correspondent : you 're talking in the neighborhood of about 7,000 @entity26 sailors , 75 fighter jets on board			2
this is going to be a combination of air and sea , last for about four days			2
and , so , that 's when we will have to start really keeping an eye on what @entity4 's response will be when those training exercises start			1
@entity23 : these military exercises have been planned for awhile			1
@entity4 characterizes them as a " pretext for aggression " that could ignite a war and says they 're creating a state of " ultra emergency " in the @entity36			1
why do some @entity26 lawmakers doubt there 'll be a war ? because @entity4 's done this sort of thing before -- they 've made these threatening statements -- in hopes of getting other countries to pacify @entity4 with aid or money			1
senator @entity25 says the @entity26 has given @entity4 more than a billion dollars in the past 15 years to try to get @entity4 to negotiate			1
so why is that country 's threat still serious ? because last week , @entity4 attacked a @entity33 island , killing two @entity33 marines and two civilians			1
it said that was in response to military exercises being done by @entity33 alone			1
and @entity4 has moved surface - to - air missiles to its border with @entity33			1
why does all this matter so much to the @entity26 ? well , you know that the @entity26 was involved in the @entity86			2
today , @entity26 has a defense treaty with @entity33			1
if war breaks out again between @entity89 , the @entity26 is committed to help defend @entity33			2
plot in @entity5 @entity23 : the place : @entity5 , @entity6			2
the event : the lighting of the city 's christmas tree			1
the problem : officials say someone wanted to bomb the celebration , which attracts thousands of people			2
he failed , as you can see here , the tree shining with lights and the flashes of cameras from the crowd			2
those who were here are thankful to the @entity5 police and the @entity110 who say this man -- 19 - year - old @entity113 -- tried to blow up what he thought was a car bomb at the ceremony on friday night			0
police say the @entity119 teen was interested in violent religious attacks , but that the people at the event were never in any real danger , because officials had had their eye on @entity126 for a long time			0
the @entity110 says it had worked undercover to trap the suspect			0
this included getting in touch with @entity126 , finding out what he allegedly wanted to attack , and then providing a fake car bomb that @entity126 is accused of trying to detonate several times during the ceremony			0
@entity119 leaders in the @entity5 area spoke out against the plot and any violence that targets innocent people			0
is this legit ? @entity138 , @entity15 : is this legit ? @entity7 's government is a constitutional monarchy			1
not legit ! @entity7 is a republic ; its president is elected by popular vote			1
@entity143 @entity23 : so @entity7 's people may choose their leader directly , but did they have the chance to do it fairly ? there were 18 candidates for president in yesterday 's election in @entity7			1
11 of them say the vote was tainted by fraud all over the country			1
the leading politician even asked for the election to be canceled ! @entity157 takes you to the political scene in a country crushed by poverty , disaster and disease			1
( begin video ) @entity165 , @entity0 correspondent : @entity7 's presidential palace still lies in ruins , but that has n't stopped these politicians from competing for the top job			1
eighteen candidates , mobilizing supporters and money , to win the post of president			1
historically , @entity7 elections are plagued by violence , allegations of fraud , and logistical problems			1
this year , election officials say they 've trained staff and carefully prepared ballot counting centers to ensure a smoother election			0
but 48 hours before the polls were scheduled to open , crowds waited in line to receive identification cards that will allow them to vote			0
at the beginning of this month , hundreds of thousands of @entity190 cards had yet to be distributed			0
election workers , disorganized , struggling to maintain order			0
at least one woman collapses after waiting for hours			0
and tempers start to flare			0
meanwhile , fresh reports of violence			0
the @entity198 says it deployed peacekeepers and police to one southern town friday night after supporters of presidential candidate @entity203 clashed with members of the outgoing president 's political party			1
last week , @entity207 lost control of the streets of @entity7 's second largest city , after a deadly cholera outbreak triggered violent protests			1
@entity7 authorities are n't taking any chances			1
they 're imposing strict curfews on vehicle traffic on election day , banning the sale of alcohol , and suspending licenses for guns until three days after the vote			0
( @entity224 ) @entity225 @entity226 , @entity15 : time for a shoutout ! what is the monday after @entity18 weekend known as ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) leftover monday , b ) online monday , c ) cyber monday or @entity236 ) manic monday ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! many stores see cyber monday as the beginning of the online shopping season for the holidays ! that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! more hype than sales ? @entity23 : that means today , millions of @entity26 will be shopping online ; many of them are going to be at work when they do			1
@entity250 says that 17 percent of adult @entity26 will be surfing for internet deals today , while 13 percent are expected to actually set foot in a store			1
so you can see the difference between cyber monday , and @entity256 , which was last week			0
retailers were hoping to get in the black , meaning they 'd be making profits , but this time around , it looks like @entity256 was more hype than sales			0
the crowds were bigger overall			0
but the actual increase in @entity256 sales was only slight			0
in fact , it was about the same increase over last year as last year was over the year before			0
football concussions @entity23 : @entity0 recently interviewed @entity270			1
he 's a former @entity271 linebacker who clearly remembers one of the big plays he made in @entity274 11			2
that was back in 1977			0
but if you were to ask @entity270 where he was yesterday and whom he just met , the 58 - year - old has trouble remembering			0
doctor @entity284 interviews another football player and tells us what could be the reasons why for these memory issues			0
( begin video ) @entity284 , @entity289 : do you feel like now , in retrospect , you ever stayed in the game or was sort of pushed to stay in the game when you should n't have ? @entity294 , former nfl quarterback : yes , there 's no question that 's happened			1
a lot of guys when they get those hits or those concussions , they think , " ok , i 'm just going to play through it here for the short - term and it 's going to get better			1
" @entity306 : he was just lifted up and deposited - @entity308 : playing through it is part of football says @entity294			0
@entity313 : probably 100 percent of the guys that played my sport in the @entity318 have been there			1
and i think for a long time it was felt like , well , if you did n't get up dizzy or with no memory , then you really did n't suffer a concussion			0
@entity308 : what does a concussion feel like ? @entity313 : it 's like a mental fogginess , where you almost seem like you 're separated from the situation			2
you 're in it , but you 're kind of looking at it from the outside looking in			0
@entity333 : how many of you have -- by show of hands - had a concussion ? @entity308 : @entity336 , formerly a @entity338 trainer , studies concussions ' impact on the brain in high school players			2
@entity343 , @entity344 , former nfl trainer : this is showing moderate levels of atrophy			0
@entity308 : and retired @entity318 athletes			1
in his study , players who 've had three or more concussions get @entity354			2
@entity355 : i 'm going to say three words			0
@entity308 : and memory tests			0
@entity355 : @entity359 , penny , table			0
@entity364 : @entity359 , penny , table			0
@entity308 : memory problems are not the only thing they are finding			0
@entity333 : the brain has shrunk			0
@entity308 : concussions may be shrinking memory and learning centers in the brain , thwarting its ability to transmit signals			2
( @entity224 ) @entity23 : we asked the @entity318 about @entity294 's statement about players staying in the game even if they are hurt			1
the organization 's response : " if anything , we are going in the other direction where people sit out until they are totally symptom - free			2
there are so many protocols now , if a guy gets pulled out in a game , he can not go back until he 's cleared by the team doctor			1
" before we go @entity23 : 't is the season when you see members of the @entity393 , ringing bells outside stores			0
they do n't have to be human			0
here 's @entity396 , a miniature horse who 's harnessed the heart of the holidays			2
his owner says she saw too many people passing by the kettle without making donations			0
so with a little training , @entity396 rings a bell and brings money to the pan ! goodbye @entity23 : silencing all the neigh - sayers			0
hey , @entity396 may be a little guy , but he 's still a stud			2
