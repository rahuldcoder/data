-- there are plenty of ways to game the upcoming @entity6 decision on health care reform , and they 've all been said : president @entity10 loses in court , he wins with his base			1
or it 's a severe blow , potentially fatal			2
or @entity14 benefit if they win , because they were " right " all along			2
or the @entity14 loses , because it has to figure out what to offer for health care instead			1
but there 's something else going on here , and it 's more meaningful than some short - term political skirmishing			2
this @entity6 case is the @entity22 for political polarization , because it underscores something we should have known all along : great changes in national public policy should never be erected on slender partisan majorities			1
if they are , they will always be suspect			2
it 's a proposition advanced by the late sen. @entity31 , who understood there 's little upside to partisan policymaking			1
after all , he was a member of the 1983 commission that reformed -- and saved -- @entity37 for a generation			2
the program faced collapse ; a bipartisan group of heavy - hitters fixed it , together			2
no one liked all that the rescue plan contained			2
but the work had to be done and they did it			2
that kind of work is not something we see a lot of these days : health care reform , arguably the most far - reaching social legislation since @entity49 , was passed strictly along party lines			1
sure , the @entity57 says -- with some justification -- that @entity14 were n't interested in their plan			0
but would the @entity14 have bitten on a more scaled - back version ? would some in the @entity14 have broken ranks over , say , requiring insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions so long as it would n't bankrupt them ? sure			0
but that was n't to be			0
the @entity65 had a two - house majority , so the stars were aligned			0
and with recalcitrant @entity14 vocal in their opposition , the @entity65 , too , became more strident			0
so reform was an all - @entity65 bill , a sure way to be challenged before the high court			1
and no one looks good : the president , who monday seemed to be warning the court about " judicial activism " in advance of any decision ; the court , which about half of the public now believes is political anyway ; and @entity83 , which has an approval rating so low it 's hard to even find			1
that 's what happens when @entity89 's default setting is always along party lines			1
and it 's not going to get any better			0
as congressional districts are redrawn to benefit partisans , those elected become -- naturally -- more partisan			1
so there is no political benefit to compromise , and as conservative southern @entity65 virtually disappear , there are no natural allies left in the @entity65 party for vote - hunting @entity100			1
the same goes for @entity65 in search of moderate @entity14 , most of whom are either quitting @entity83 out of frustration ( see : sen. @entity105 of @entity106 ) or are fighting for their political lives ( see : sen. @entity108 of @entity109 )			1
imagine today 's @entity83 passing , by bipartisan majorities , legislation on two controversial issues : taxes and immigration reform			1
@entity116 , right ? well , it was done in the mid- 1980 's			0
the tax measure lowered rates and eliminated some loopholes ( many , alas , have crept back into the code , but that 's another story			0
) and the immigration bill legalized certain illegal immigrants while punishing employers for hiring illegal immigrants			0
( and of course we are back at that issue again )			0
so while the measures were far from permanent or perfect solutions , they were big fixes			1
sure , @entity65 controlled the @entity57 and @entity14 maintained control of the @entity134 and president @entity135 , a @entity14 , was in his second term , finding a way to cut deals with members of both parties			0
oh , and by the way , the chairmen of the tax - writing committee -- a @entity57 @entity144 and a @entity134 @entity14 -- actually worked together to get something through the @entity83			1
ditto for those writing the immigration legislation			0
i watched them in action			0
believe me , it was nothing like watching the debt - ceiling debacle of last summer			0
even when there was one small glimmer of hope that the @entity57 and @entity14 house speaker @entity159 might work something out , it disappeared			0
and almost one year later , each side is trying to get history to blame the other fellow for the failure to strike a deal			0
it 's too bad , really			0
because in the end , history will blame both sides -- for looking small when most of the country thinks our problems deserve solutions that are really big			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			1

@entity177 says the @entity6 health care case is a *symptom* of what ails us
one of the most *important* *law*s in decades was passed on purely partisan vote , she says
now the court may deliver a *verdict* on the *law* along partisan lines , @entity177 says
@entity177 : @entity194 wants @entity83 to step up and address big problems *effectively*
