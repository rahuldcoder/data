@entity0 -- a leading @entity4 - @entity3 group lashed out at the federal government friday for moving to seize assets -- including four mosques -- that belong to a foundation and a corporation believed linked to @entity10			1
" @entity4 and faith communities must not allow houses of worship to become pawns in geopolitical struggles , " said @entity11 , executive director of the @entity13 's @entity12			1
" the tension between the @entity3 and @entity10 must not be played out in the mosques of @entity3			1
" federal prosecutors say their actions against assets belonging to the @entity24 and the @entity25 , which also include a @entity27 skyscraper , are not an effort to target mosques			1
" there are no allegations of any wrongdoing on the part of any of these tenants or occupants , " said @entity30 , a spokesman for the @entity31 for the @entity32 in a written statement thursday			0
" the tenants and occupants remain free to use the properties as they have before today 's filing			0
" a senior @entity44 official told reporters that the government is moving against the @entity10 landlords of the buildings , not seizing mosques as religious - oriented facilities			1
the mosques -- in @entity0 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 -- just happen to be among the tenants of the buildings in question , the official said			0
but the @entity13 's @entity12 called the actions an " unprecedented encroachment of religious freedom			0
" the group said " it is an abiding concern among the @entity64 that this action is just the beginning of a backlash after last week 's @entity68 shooting tragedy			0
" a @entity4 - @entity3 soldier is accused in a @entity68 , @entity54 , shooting spree that left 13 people dead and dozens injured			2
the @entity74 , another leading @entity4 - @entity3 group , issued a statement thursday saying the government 's actions may have @entity79 implications			1
" whatever the details of the government 's case against the owners of the mosques , as a civil rights organization we are concerned that the seizure of @entity3 houses of worship could have a chilling effect on the religious freedom of citizens of all faiths and may send a negative message to @entity97 worldwide , " said @entity80 , the national communications director for the council			1
the controversy erupted after prosecutors in @entity0 filed an amended civil complaint seeking forfeiture of all assets of the @entity24 and @entity25 they include properties owned by the foundation in several states			1
a 36 - story office tower in midtown @entity27 is owned by the 650 @entity107 , a partnership between @entity109 and @entity110 , the @entity44 said			2
the complaint alleges that the @entity24 provided services to the @entity10 government and transferred money from 650 @entity107 to @entity115 , @entity10 's largest state - owned financial entity			1
@entity3 and @entity117 officials last year designated @entity115 as a proliferator for supporting @entity10 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and funneling money to the @entity122 and @entity123 , considered terrorist groups by the @entity3			1
@entity115 issued a statement last year denying involvement in deceptive banking practices			0
prosecutors allege the properties at issue were " involved in and [ were ] the proceeds of money laundering offenses , " and that the owners violated the @entity134 , executive orders and @entity3 @entity137 regulations			2
" as today 's complaint alleges in great detail , the @entity24 has effectively been a front for the government of @entity10 , " @entity138 , @entity3 attorney for the @entity32 , said on thursday			1
" for two decades , the @entity24 's affairs have been directed by various @entity10 officials , including @entity10 ambassadors to the @entity146 , in violation of a series of @entity3 laws			1
the @entity24 's former president remains under investigation for alleged obstruction of justice , and both the criminal and civil investigations are ongoing			2
" @entity155 , a @entity0 lawyer representing the @entity24 , said his client would challenge the complaint			2
" we 're obviously disappointed that the government brought this action because we have been cooperating with the government since this investigation began about a year ago and we intend to litigate this matter , " he said			0
" it may take some time , but at the end of this litigation , we 're of the mind that we 're going to prevail here			0
" the buildings remained open and were continuing to operate as usual			0
when a @entity1 reporter arrived at one of the seized mosques -- in @entity172 , a @entity0 borough -- he found it to be operating normally			0
there was a copy of the federal complaint taped to the front door of the building , but the doors were open and people were coming and going			0
calls to the @entity10 mission for comment were not immediately returned			2
a report friday on the web site of @entity10 's state - run @entity186 did not contain any responses from @entity10 officials			0
@entity1 's @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 and @entity193 contributed to this story .			0
