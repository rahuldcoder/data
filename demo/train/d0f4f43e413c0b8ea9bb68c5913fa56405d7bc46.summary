@entity0 -- lawyers in the @entity5 manslaughter trial will take wednesday off from court to prepare their closing arguments , a day after the doctor declined to testify in his defense in the death of singer @entity10			1
@entity5 announced in court tuesday that he will not take the stand , pausing to look at each of his lawyers for several seconds before telling the judge , " my decision is that i will not testify in this matter			1
" his decision to remain silent ended the defense case in the trial of @entity10 's doctor , setting the stage for closing arguments on thursday			1
the end of testimony was emotional for dozens of the singer 's fans who converged at the @entity30 courthouse during the six - week trial			1
a fan was removed from the courthouse after yelling " @entity35 " at @entity5 as he walked down the hallway during a recess tuesday			1
fans also surrounded and yelled at defense anesthesiology expert dr. @entity37 as he waited for a cab on a courthouse sidewalk			2
others lined both sides of the hallway and held hands as members of @entity10 's family walked past			0
@entity46 and @entity47 attended court tuesday , along with their daughter , @entity49 and youngest son , @entity51			2
as @entity47 and @entity49 left the courthouse , they took with them several signs used by fans in loud protests each day			0
prosecutors briefly recalled their anesthesiology expert , dr. @entity60 , for a rebuttal to defense propofol expert dr. @entity37 before resting their case tuesday morning			2
@entity64 judge @entity63 met with lawyers for both sides tuesday afternoon to discuss what exhibits will be admitted into evidence and what instructions he will give jurors before they begin deliberations thursday			1
the prosecution contends that @entity5 's use of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat @entity10 's insomnia in his home deviated from the standards of care expected of a doctor so egregiously that it made him criminally responsible for @entity10 's death			1
@entity5 has pleaded not guilty			1
if @entity5 had decided to tell jurors his version of what happened the day the pop star died under his care , it would have been at the risk of intensive cross-examination by @entity30 deputy district attorney @entity90			1
@entity90 proved his cross-examination skills again monday in a fiery battle with @entity37 over the defense anesthesiology expert 's theory that @entity10 died from drugs he gave himself			0
@entity37 completed his testimony tuesday morning			2
@entity37 's bruises in his battle with @entity90 on monday included a contempt - of - court citation and a $ 1,000 fine after he ignored repeated warnings from @entity63 not to refer to his personal conversations with @entity5			1
@entity90 insisted that @entity37 answer his questions based only on what he knew from @entity5 's interview with police , not what @entity5 told him privately			1
it otherwise would have been a way for the defense to introduce statements from the defendant without him having to testify			0
" @entity113 try , " @entity63 told the defense as he ruled they could n't do that			0
@entity90 spent much of monday trying to discredit what @entity37 said during his testimony friday , and getting the defense expert to support the prosecution 's argument that @entity5 's treatment of @entity10 was reckless			1
@entity37 conceded that @entity5 deviated from the standards of care , but he would not agree that they were so " egregious and extreme " that they make @entity5 criminally responsible for @entity10 's death			1
@entity5 's deviations were " perhaps between minor and serious , but it 's not extreme , " he said			1
@entity90 also was successful in getting @entity37 to agree that he would not have done what @entity5 did -- take the job of sedating @entity10 nearly every night at home with propofol			1
" no amount of money " could get him to take the job , @entity37 said			0
" absolutely not , " he testified			0
" that would be a job i would never consider accepting			0
" the prosecution contends greed led @entity5 to leave his medical practice and put his ethics aside to serve as @entity10 's private doctor for $ 150,000 a month			1
but the biggest battle between @entity90 and @entity37 was fought over the competing theories of how @entity10 died and the scientific evidence that supports them			0
the @entity30 coroner ruled that @entity10 's june 25 , 2009 , death was caused by " acute propofol intoxication " in combination with two sedatives			0
@entity37 concluded that the level of drugs found in @entity10 's stomach , blood and urine , convinced him that @entity10 died after he rapidly injected himself with propofol on top of a large dose of lorazepam he swallowed hours earlier			0
@entity60 , the prosecution 's propofol expert , concluded the " only scenario " that fits the scientific evidence is that @entity10 was on a constant intravenous drip of propofol for three hours before his death			0
@entity60 also testified that @entity5 must have also injected @entity10 with a series of large doses of lorazepam , a sedative , hours before his death			2
@entity37 theorized that @entity10 could have " pushed " the drug into an catheter in his leg using a syringe over a 15 - to 30 - second period , much faster than a doctor would have done			0
" i believe it could potentially have lethal consequences , " @entity37 testified			0
under cross-examination monday , @entity37 said he believed @entity10 used the same syringe @entity5 had loaded with propofol an hour earlier to give @entity10 a 25 - milligram injection			2
@entity5 filled it with 50 milligrams initially , leaving it half - filled in @entity10 's bedroom , under @entity37 's theory			2
@entity37 ruled out the possibility that @entity5 would have injected the fatal dose unless " he wanted to potentially harm mr. @entity51			2
" @entity90 asked @entity37 whether he thought @entity10 intended to harm himself			0
" i do n't think he realized the potential danger , " @entity37 replied			0
the defense contends @entity10 was desperate for sleep , fearing his comeback concerts would be canceled if he missed another rehearsal from lack of rest			0
@entity90 pressed @entity37 for an opinion about @entity5 's decision to leave @entity10 alone with a syringe of propofol , considering he should have known @entity10 had " pushed " a syringe of propofol before			1
" no , i would not leave the room , " he said			0
prosecutors contend @entity5 is responsible for @entity10 's death , even if he did not give him the final and fatal dose , because he was reckless in using the surgical anesthetic to help @entity10 sleep without proper precautions .			2
