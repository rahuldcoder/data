@entity0 says energy companies should not drill for crude in @entity4 waters , marking the first time an oil major has publicly spoken out against offshore oil exploration in the region			1
@entity9 , @entity0 's chief executive , told the @entity10 the risk of an oil spill in such an environmentally sensitive area was simply too high			1
" oil on @entity16 would be a disaster , " he said in an interview			2
" a leak would do too much damage to the image of the company "			2
last week , @entity22 had to postpone until next year an attempt to drill into oil - bearing rock off the @entity26 coast after a piece of safety equipment was damaged during testing			1
it has spent $ 4.5bn and seven years preparing to drill			2
@entity31 , @entity32 of @entity33 and @entity35 's @entity34 have also signed deals to explore for oil in @entity39 's @entity4 waters , while others have secured licences to drill off @entity16			1
mr @entity9 emphasised that he was not opposed to @entity4 exploration in principle			1
@entity0 has a number of natural gas ventures in the region , including a stake in the vast @entity49 field in @entity39 's @entity50			1
the total chief executive said gas leaks were easier to deal with than oil spills			2
his comments were welcomed by environmental groups that are opposed to @entity57 's presence in what they see as a near - pristine wilderness			2
" the rest of the oil industry should heed his warning , " said @entity60 , head of @entity62 's @entity4 campaign			1
" given the risks , companies should n't be touching the @entity4 with a barge pole			1
" @entity22 declined to comment			0
it has said in the past that it is well prepared for spills , with round - the - clock response teams on @entity26 's @entity72 and a fleet of specialised vessels that will be in place before drilling starts			0
according to a 2008 study by the @entity78 , the @entity4 contains just over a fifth of the world 's undiscovered , recoverable oil and gas resources			1
the melting of the polar ice cap has made the area more accessible to the majors than ever before			0
the region 's challenges are formidable , however , ranging from icebergs the size of cities to storms , darkness and fierce cold			0
there is also no certainty of success : @entity100 - listed explorer @entity99 spent $ 1bn exploring off @entity16 and failed to find commercial volumes of oil			2
@entity0 's @entity4 projects are concentrated in @entity39			1
as well as its stake in @entity49 , it has interests in a number of onshore developments , such as a big liquefied natural gas venture in @entity39 's far north known as @entity111			0
it also operates a @entity114 oilfield called @entity115			0
@entity116 announced in august that it was shelving @entity49 due to excessive costs			0
but mr @entity9 said as far as he was concerned , it was still on			0
" @entity116 never told me in writing that the project is over , " he said			0
" discussions are not ... as active as i would like			0
[ but ] the reserves are still there			0
