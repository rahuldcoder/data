ever since @entity3 won his way to the @entity5 in 1976 by assuring voters that they could trust him in contrast to the more experienced opponents he faced , both @entity10 and @entity11 candidates have tended to boast about every part of their resume that can distinguish themselves from the @entity16 status quo			1
in 2008 , then - sen. @entity17 undercut the " inevitable " @entity11 nominee @entity18 by running as the candidate who was the least corrupted by the bargaining ways of @entity21			1
through its portrayal of sen. @entity25 's selection of @entity26 , the @entity28 film " @entity29 " effectively captures just how far political candidates are willing to go to have this appeal			2
this year , the story is the same			0
although president @entity17 is boasting of his accomplishments in the @entity5 as the nation 's leader , he is also using @entity37 as a foil to lambaste the way that the " real " insiders in the capital do their business			1
@entity43 and @entity44 have tried to transform themselves from pillars of the congressional @entity10 establishment into conservative mavericks , while front - runner @entity49 talks frequently about how he would bring the skills of a ceo to @entity16			1
the problem is that doing well in @entity16 requires a very different kind of skill set than the ones that business executives or mavericks bring to the table			1
each of these claims is flawed -- as @entity17 himself discovered -- given the world in which presidents must operate			1
presidents govern in a porous world that makes every move and decision visible to the public within a relatively short time span			0
constant scrutiny from the media means the president essentially works inside glass walls			1
a ceo enjoys a certain amount of space in which to work through the different options on the table , and even some room to make some mistakes in the process , before announcing a final decision			0
both presidents @entity3 ( with " @entity82 " ) and @entity17 ( with the @entity84 scandal ) have found out how impossible it is to maintain the image of the maverick once under the constant scrutiny of the media			1
moreover , the experiences of the ceo and the outsider do little to prepare a candidate for the government 's separation of power			2
the fact is that the president only gets partial control of the mechanisms to run @entity16			1
in his second year as president , @entity99 admitted , " the fact is that i think @entity37 looks more powerful sitting here than it did when i was in @entity37 ... when you are in @entity37 , you are one of a hundred in the @entity105 or one of 435 in the @entity5 , so that power is divided			0
but from here i look at a @entity37 and i look at the collective power of the @entity37 ... and it is a substantial power			0
" while the ceo does have to report to a board of directors , chief executives do n't have to share their own authority with a legislature such as @entity37 -- two other decision - making authorities that carry great weight , each of which has very different incentives and interests			0
a recent piece by @entity119 made @entity49 's gubernatorial experiences sound a lot like @entity3 's presidency , as the former businessman had immense trouble interacting with members of the state legislature in @entity127			1
according to one democratic state senator , " @entity49 did n't want to deal with legislators			2
typically , the governor wants to have a productive relationship with the legislature			0
that is not something that happened with him			0
" similarly , like it or not , it is hard to act as an outsider once daily life involves dealing with hundreds of insiders with considerable power			0
a president can talk about reforming government and working outside the system , but will only be able to accomplish things by making deals with the very forces and through the very processes they detest			2
once presidents start to do so , they look more like the @entity16 insiders against which they ran			1
finally , presidents have millions of bosses			0
while the ceo can focus his or her energy on pleasing shareholders or the board of directors and the outsider often does not have to report to anyone at all , the president is being judged by millions of bosses -- the @entity162 voters -- each with different interests and objectives			2
notwithstanding the constant discussion of a " red " and " blue " @entity162 , the reality is much messier than that			0
in certain respects , if the nation was divided so clearly along these lines governance would be easier			0
as presidents start to make tough choices about what legislation to propose and what bills to sign into law , the challenge of having to please so many bosses becomes evident			0
indeed , @entity17 has struggled in recent months to rebuild the coalition that frayed as many of his decisions angered core supporters and alienated the moderate voters he won over in 2008			1
in the end , presidential politics is about surviving and thriving in @entity16			2
the kinds of talents that so many candidates like to boast about these days really have little to do with the institutions that the winner will have to govern			0
it 's time to recognize that having a deep political resume is more of a virtue than a vice			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

@entity197 : @entity49 stresses that his career outside @entity16 is a plus
in 2008 , @entity17 ran as an outsider who was capable of fixing @entity16
@entity197 : the reality is a president has to be able to operate inside the political system
a long political resume should be seen as a plus , not a *negative* , @entity197 says
