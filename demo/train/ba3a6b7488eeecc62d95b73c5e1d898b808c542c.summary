claiming that even the prison in @entity3 , @entity4 , is air conditioned , prisoners in @entity1 have filed a federal lawsuit over soaring temperatures in state prisons that they say have killed at least 12 prisoners in the last three years			1
the suit , filed by the @entity11 and the @entity13 clinic on behalf of the prisoners , is n't seeking monetary damages			1
it seeks cooler temperatures for the prisoners			2
eighty - eight degrees to be exact			2
the lawsuit , broadly concerned about the lack of air conditioning across state facilities , centers on a facility in @entity24 , @entity1 , known as the @entity25			1
located about 70 miles northwest of @entity27 , the facility houses about 1,400 men			1
as of january , the compliant said , 114 men over the age of 70 were housed there			2
they have no air conditioning , and the windows which do open provide little relief , the suit claims , leading to temperatures inside that often exceed those outside			0
and outside it 's hot			0
the suit cites internal data from the @entity44 which found that over the past three years the mercury topped 100 degrees @entity46			2
" stainless steel tables in the inmate dormitories become hot to the touch " the complaint reads and " prisoners have to lay towels down on the table to rest their elbows while sitting			2
" in addition to the older inmates , the complaint said a number of men have various underlying medical conditions that make them especially vulnerable to heat stroke , like 69 - year - old @entity63 , who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension			1
" i do n't know if i will make it this summer			0
the heat and humidity are so bad inside i have trouble breathing , " said @entity63 , one of three named plaintiffs , in a press release announcing the lawsuit			1
the lawsuit alleges some 20 deaths since 1998 and details names , ages and internal body temperatures of the victims , including cases where the body temperature recorded was well over 100 degrees			1
one man , 45 - year - old @entity81 , died one day after his arrival			0
his internal temperature registered 109.9			0
there is air conditioning in some parts of the facility			0
the law library , education building and visitation center all are equipped with air conditioning , according to the complaint , but the inmates are " rarely allowed " in these areas			0
the complaint also said that the warden 's office and other administrative buildings have air conditioning			0
county prisons also have air conditioning			0
@entity1 statute mandates those jails keep temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees inside , but the state system , according to the complaint , has no such requirement			0
the lawsuit alleges the conditions violate federal law and the inmate 's constitutional rights against cruel and unusual punishment			0
men treated worse than pigs ? the lawsuit alleges that hogs on @entity44 property receive better treatment than the prisoners			1
" @entity44 policy requires temperatures be kept no higher than 85 degrees to ensure ' pig comfort , ' " the suit said , adding that the department begins " to cool the pigs when the temperature goes above 74 degrees to keep the pigs ' comfortable			1
' " @entity128 , a spokesman for the @entity44 , said the department could n't comment on pending legislation			1
but he did spell out what the agency does to " mitigate temperature extremes			1
" the agency provides water and allows for additional showers " when feasible			0
" @entity128 also said the staff is trained to identify " offenders susceptible to heat - related issues			0
" guards not immune but according to the complaint the staff may also need to identify heat - related issues for one another , since they also have to go into the hot rooms of the prison			1
" the correctional officer 's union has made numerous public requests for the prison housing areas to be air conditioned , " the complaint said , detailing one female guard who suffered heat exhaustion and dehydration			1
the plaintiffs said the situation has led to the correctional officer 's union lending public support to the suit			0
@entity128 said the department does n't have the money to make changes , conceding " a detailed cost analysis has not been done			2

prisoners do n't want monetary damages ; they want prisons cooled to *88* degrees
lawsuit centers on facility located north of @entity27 that houses 1,400 men
plaintiffs allege that the heat in the prisons has killed 20 men since 19*88*
prison spokesman said department does what it can to " mitigate temperature extremes "
