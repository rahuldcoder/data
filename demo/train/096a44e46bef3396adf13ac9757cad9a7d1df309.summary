-- a coroner has adjourned the fourth inquest into the death of a baby believed to have been killed by a dingo in central @entity6 more than 30 years ago			1
@entity7 was just two months old when she was snatched from a tent during a family holiday to @entity10 , also known as @entity10 , sparking one of the country 's most sensational and enduring murder mysteries			1
her mother , @entity14 , long maintained that a dingo , a wild dog native to @entity6 , took her baby , even as she was sentenced to life in jail for daughter 's murder , a conviction that was later quashed			1
her cries of a " dingo 's got my baby " were immortalized in the 1988 film " @entity30 , " starring @entity26 who earned an @entity28 nomination for the role			1
outside @entity34 on friday , @entity33 - @entity32 said she hoped the ruling would help educate the public about the dangers posed by dingoes			2
" it gives me hope that @entity6 will finally realize dingoes are dangerous and hope that justice will finally be done for my daughter as well , " she said			2
a ruling is expected next week			2
@entity33 - @entity32 is seeking to change the open verdict on her daughter 's death certificate to indicate that she was taken by a dingo			1
" there is a lot of new evidence			2
the last inquest was in 1995 and since then there have been a number of significant dingo attacks , " said @entity52 , the lawyer representing @entity14 and her former husband @entity53			1
it is the fourth inquest into @entity60 's death			1
the first inquest , in 1981 , found that the baby died as a result of being taken by a dingo , but a second the following year committed her mother to trial for murder			1
the 35 - day hearing created a media frenzy in @entity6 as commentators picked apart the intricacies of the case , while a fascinated public speculated wildly as to why and how @entity60 had died			0
" a lot of people just never believed a dingo was capable of doing it , " @entity52 said			1
the jury returned its verdict in 1982 : @entity33 - @entity32 was found guilty of slitting her daughter 's throat with a pair of scissors before hiding the body and concocting a story about a dingo to cover her crime			1
she was sentenced to life in jail			0
her husband @entity53 was given a suspended sentence after being found guilty of being an accessory after the fact			1
the couple had two other children ; two boys aged six and four at the time of @entity60 's death			1
@entity33 - @entity32 served four years of her sentence before the @entity102 government ordered her release in 1986 after the discovery of new evidence ; a baby 's jacket , believed to be @entity60 's , found half - buried near a dingo lair at @entity10			1
in 1988 , a @entity109 set up to review the evidence formally quashed convictions for both husband and wife			0
despite the finding that the couple was not to blame , a third inquest into their daughter 's death returned an open verdict in 1995			1
it 's that ruling that the @entity33 now want changed			0
" certainly , like any parent , they want closure and they 're not going to be able to get closure until the record 's correct , " @entity52 said			0
" at the moment an open finding is not a correct finding			0
" " there 's certainly a personal part in the journey but they want to warn people and make sure the tragedy does n't occur again , " he said			0
on friday , he presented the coroner with evidence of at least 12 " very significant " dingo attacks in @entity6 since the last inquest in 1995			1
in one of the worst cases , a nine - year - old boy was killed , and his friend mauled , by two dingoes on @entity146 , off the coast of @entity148 , in 2001			1
twenty - eight dingoes were culled in the public outcry that followed			0
the world 's largest sand island , @entity146 earned @entity154 status for its " exceptional beauty " and its rare combination of tall rainforests and towering sand dunes			0
it 's also home to the largest population of native @entity6 dingoes -- around 200 animals living in up to 30 packs -- and the site of most , if not all , dingo attacks			2
" on @entity146 the dingo has a particularly difficult role because tourists are as interested in the dingo as the dingo is interested in food , " said professor @entity167 , a dingo expert from the @entity168 in @entity169			2
" @entity176 , very often , is the only thing that stands between a dangerous animal and a human			0
once that fear is lost any predatory animal can become dangerous , " she said			0
@entity182 management strategies have been introduced in areas of the country where the mammals are prevalent			0
@entity146 's includes approval to cull specific animals considered to pose a threat to humans			0
" once a dingo has lost its fear of people and starts to use aggressive tactics to gain dominance over , or food from , people the habit can not be changed , " according to the @entity148 government 's campaign " be dingo - safe ! " it adds : " these dingoes display aggressive or dangerous behavior such as nipping and biting , and in some cases this escalates very quickly to attacks and serious mauling			2
" the @entity33 's lawyer @entity52 says that , if nothing else , the couple hopes a change in the official cause of @entity60 's death makes " public authorities more aware of their responsibilties			2
" this will make them fine tune , hopefully , those plans and make them current and keep updating them , " he said			0
where once many people -- including the jury that convicted @entity14 and @entity223 -- believed that it was unlikely that a dingo would kill a baby , evidence in recent years shows that is indeed possible			1
however , @entity167 said public opinion had swung too far the other way , and @entity6 's largest native predator had been unfairly " demonized			0
" " a dingo is a suitable animal to be demonized , is n't it ? in one way you can know it , and in the other way it 's mysterious , " she said			2
@entity167 warned that if more was n't done to protect the animals in their natural habitat , they would eventually die out			0
" this is a very rare and endangered @entity6 native animal , " she said			0
" if that goes extinct , there will be outcry in future that we 've allowed that to happen , because there are so many misconceptions about the animal			0
