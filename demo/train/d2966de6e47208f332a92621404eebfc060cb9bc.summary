-- @entity2 ' inaction to extend unemployment benefits to millions of struggling @entity4 is not only irresponsible policy , it is morally wrong			1
the economy is getting better for some , but the tragic effects of reckless public policy and deregulation spurred by the disproportionate political influence of big money still linger for far too many ordinary @entity4			0
@entity2 , the elected representatives of the people , must find its moral compass , push through this unending nightmare of political gridlock and do right by the people			1
contrary to the silly and obsessive partisan gamesmanship that currently paralyzes our politics , much more is at stake than the next election or some empty ideological argument			0
on the line are the lives of decent hardworking @entity4 , trying to cross over into the dignity of work but still caught in the barbwire of a historic global recession			0
opinion : for women , equal pay and economic justice are civil rights issues some argue that unemployment benefits are a disincentive to people finding employment			1
but the sheer number of our unemployed neighbors and family members speaks volumes about the fallibility of such a claim			0
according to the @entity50 , the long - term unemployment rate has not been as high as it is now since @entity52 a jaw - dropping 4 million @entity4 have been out of work for 27 weeks or longer			1
the problems we face are systemic and structural , and the vast majority of the unemployed are crippled not by a lack of interest or drive , but of opportunity and access			0
that 's why long - term solutions for economic growth are needed			0
but in the meantime , we will actually do further damage to a struggling economy if our elected officials shape public policy by the very same stereotypes and faulty assumptions that keep some unemployed in the first place			0
for a major reason that the unemployed can not find work is because they are unemployed			1
the data show that they face bias and discrimination			0
if anyone has the ability to provide some relief from this vicious cycle , it is @entity2 , and its members should feel obligated to do so			1
moreover , those of us who are faith leaders , particularly we pastors in the @entity4 churches , should speak up too			1
because black unemployment is twice that of whites and has been for as long as the @entity90 has been keeping track by race , we have an obligation to honor our historic reason for being -- defending those on the margins of the margins			1
lessons with @entity99 : eight students recall a special class as we celebrate the life of the most famous black pastor , @entity99 , we should remember that the black church mission connects faith with justice and personal salvation with social transformation , and addresses personal piety and public policy for the well - being of the whole person and the whole community			1
it fights for the weak and sees the @entity114 as " good news to the poor			0
" more than 50 years after dr. @entity99 and others marched on @entity118 for jobs and freedom , african - americans remain disproportionately unemployed and impoverished			0
the unemployment rate for @entity4 was at 12.5 % when the @entity90 released the most recent numbers last month			2
yet the fact is the black unemployment rate will undoubtedly increase if extended unemployment insurance is cut off now , adding to the devastating impact that rampant unemployment has already had on the black community for decades			1
and given our nation 's shifting demographics , that 's bad for everybody			0
the greatest @entity99 speeches you never heard playing politics with the very unemployment insurance afforded to @entity4 workers who are now unemployed is both immoral and economically destructive			2
that 's why now , more than ever , we need to hear the voices of people of faith and people of good will raising the moral and practical questions about who we are to one another			2
and the black church -- that @entity4 church built by those who worked without wages or benefits , born fighting for freedom and thus the source of @entity159 's greatest freedom fighter -- ought to lead the way			2
if we really want to honor dr. @entity99 and protect the @entity4 promise , we must demand that @entity2 do the right thing for @entity4 workers and the right thing for the @entity4 economy			1
do not shrink a struggling economy , putting us all at risk			0
rather , extend the safety net of unemployment insurance to those who can not help but stimulate the economy by spending it immediately on the basics of food , gas and medicine , even as we debate the best prescription for long term economic health			2
it 's just the right thing to do			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			1

the rev. @entity185 says restoring unemployment aid is the right thing to do
he calls on @entity2 to find its moral compass
@entity183 wants black churches to *reclaim* their mission of engaging in social justice issues
