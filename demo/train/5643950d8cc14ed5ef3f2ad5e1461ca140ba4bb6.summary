-- when @entity3 president @entity2 visits @entity4 on thursday , he will almost certainly again ask for @entity6 military assistance , including defensive weapons			1
president @entity8 should say yes			1
arming @entity9 can deter @entity11 @entity10 from further aggression and support the fragile @entity3 ceasefire and settlement process			1
doing so would also bolster @entity6 efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation			0
@entity11 illegally occupied and annexed @entity17 in march			0
just weeks later , armed separatists -- assisted and , in some cases , led by @entity11 intelligence officers -- began seizing government buildings in the eastern @entity3 regions of @entity23 and @entity24			1
@entity3 counterattacks started making headway in the summer			1
@entity11 responded by supplying heavy weapons to the separatists -- including , it is widely believed , the @entity31 anti-aircraft system believed to have shot down @entity33 flight 17 in @entity34			0
despite the influx of arms , @entity3 forces continued to make progress			1
by early august , the separatists looked on the verge of defeat			0
that would have stopped @entity10 's strategy in its tracks			0
so , as @entity46 noted , elite @entity11 military units invaded and occupied @entity3 territory , hitting @entity3 forces hard			2
vastly outgunned , @entity2 had little choice but to accept a ceasefire on september 5			2
the truce is shaky , but the @entity3 president seems intent on pursuing a peaceful settlement			1
whether common ground can be found among @entity9 , the separatists and @entity55 is unclear			2
at best , the negotiation will be long and arduous			0
the @entity3 government has for some time sought lethal military assistance , such as anti-armor weapons , as well as secure communications equipment and reconnaissance drones			2
when he hosts @entity2 in the @entity63 , @entity8 should agree to provide defensive arms on an expedited basis			1
such assistance would enhance @entity9 's ability to deter further @entity11 aggression , aggression that would threaten , perhaps fatally , the possibility of a negotiated settlement			0
a better - armed @entity3 military would give @entity10 pause , because it could impose greater costs on the @entity11 army if the @entity11 break the ceasefire and renew the fighting			2
reports detail the extraordinary lengths , such as nighttime burials , to which the @entity80 has gone to hide from its public the fact that @entity11 soldiers have fought and died in @entity3			2
the more costly the @entity3 can make any fighting for the @entity11 , the less @entity55 's interest in resuming the conflict			1
some may argue that providing lethal military assistance would provoke @entity10 to escalate			0
but he has already escalated the situation -- from instigating separatist actions to providing heavy weapons to sending in the @entity11 army			0
this suggests the opposite may well prove true : arming @entity3 will raise the costs of escalation to @entity11 and thus make it less likely			2
@entity10 has made clear his contempt for the @entity98 response to date			0
@entity99 could embolden him to escalate in @entity3 and test the waters elsewhere , perhaps in a @entity46 member state such as @entity102			2
moreover , the @entity3 will bear the risks and brunt of any escalation			2
if they are willing to accept those risks , we should give them the tools to defend themselves			0
and there is an additional important reason to respond favorably to @entity3 's request for defensive arms : to restore credibility to the notion of security assurances			1
in december 1994 , the leaders of the @entity6 , @entity117 and @entity11 signed the @entity119 memorandum on security assurances , which committed those countries to respect @entity3 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and not use force against @entity3			1
those commitments paved the way for @entity9 's decision to give up about 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads , at the time the world 's third - largest nuclear arsenal			0
@entity55 has grossly violated the @entity119 memorandum by its seizure of @entity17 and assaults on @entity3			1
the @entity6 and @entity117 have an obligation to respond			0
@entity4 has imposed economic sanctions on @entity11 and provided @entity3 a modest amount of nonlethal military aid			1
those are appropriate steps , but they do not suffice			0
last friday , former president @entity139 , who signed the @entity119 memorandum for @entity3 , suggested his country had been cheated			1
that reflects general sentiment in @entity9			0
the widely held impression that @entity55 has violated its @entity119 commitments at low cost badly weakens the value of security assurances in the future			1
that is unfortunate , as security assurances could play a role as part of the package to resolve the @entity155 and @entity156 nuclear issues			0
but how much value will security assurances have if @entity158 and @entity159 see that they can be violated with relative impunity ? @entity4 can change that impression			1
providing lethal military assistance to @entity3 could not only deter @entity10 from further war against @entity3 , but could help to reestablish security assurances as part of the solution to critical nuclear proliferation challenges .			0
