@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 leaders @entity4 suffered another setback in their bid for a third successive title after being held 1 - 1 by @entity8 on saturday			1
@entity10 's goals have earned @entity8 four points against the @entity12 this season			1
@entity15 's team head the table by three points from @entity0 rivals @entity18 , who have three games in hand ahead of sunday 's trip to @entity23			1
visiting @entity8 , whose manager @entity24 surprisingly resigned on thursday citing a lack of financial backing from the @entity30 side 's board , took the lead in the 20th minute through left - back @entity10			1
the @entity32 played a one - two with @entity33 before crashing a shot from the edge of the box past goalkeeper @entity37 and in off the crossbar			2
@entity10 's only other goal this season came in @entity42 ' 1 - 0 win at @entity18 on october 6			1
@entity37 did well to keep out @entity44 's audacious shot from just inside the @entity4 half soon after , and also tipped over @entity46 's looping header three minutes after half - time			1
substitute @entity48 rescued @entity4 from a first home @entity3 defeat this season in the 78th minute after being teed up by @entity52 , who then headed against the post with two minutes to play			2
@entity8 held on despite having to play the final few minutes with 10 men , after @entity33 was stretchered off with their three substitutes already used			2
the victory lifted the visitors up into fifth place , while @entity4 have taken just six points from the last five games			1
@entity15 , who confirmed he is hoping to sign @entity62 defender @entity61 next month , said : " we need to cut out the silly mistakes because if you look at some of the goals we have let in away from home this season , they are silly mistakes			0
" we could have definitely done something with every one of them			0
i 'm happy with the number of chance we 've made in the last few weeks , but unhappy with individual mistakes			0
" it 's not been great to look at , and we need to cut it out			0
we have honest lads walking in to the dressing room and saying , ' that was my fault			0
' " i said to them , ' it 's very commendable lads but we ca n't keep doing this			0
' there has been a lot going right for us , but one or two things going wrong			0
we have to deal with that , and then i will look forward to the rest of the season			0
" third - placed @entity91 missed the chance to move above @entity18 after being beaten 3 - 0 at home by @entity94 , who climbed to ninth with two goals in the second half to @entity99 and then another from @entity100 on 65 minutes			1
fourth - placed @entity101 failed to take advantage , losing 2 - 1 at home to bottom club @entity104 -- whose only two wins this season have come against the @entity108			1
@entity109 put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute before striker @entity111 leveled on 29 , and @entity112 scored the eventual winner for the @entity114 outfit three minutes before half - time			2
@entity116 followed up last weekend 's shock 3 - 2 victory against @entity4 by also winning at @entity119 by the same scoreline			2
the visitors led through @entity122 after 22 minutes and @entity123 made it 2 - 0 with a 53rd - minute penalty before @entity126 pulled one back on 62 and @entity128 striker @entity127 leveled from the spot ( 90 )			0
however , @entity130 scored a dramatic injury - time winner to lift @entity132 into the top six			0
in saturday 's other game , second - bottom @entity134 drew 0 - 0 at home to fellow strugglers @entity138 to be left seven points ahead of @entity104			1

@entity144 leaders @entity4 held 1 - 1 at home by @entity8
@entity4 now lead by three points , having taken just six from last five games
