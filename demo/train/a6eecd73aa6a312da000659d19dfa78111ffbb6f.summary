-- if you 've read @entity4 ' " @entity5 " trilogy , then the odds are ever in your favor when it comes to cocktail party conversations about @entity10 , the @entity11 and the @entity12			1
if you have n't , then that was all gibberish ... but it does n't have to be			2
as " catching @entity32 , " the second movie in the series , comes to theaters november 22 we 've got all the information you need to dazzle friends with your talk of @entity25 and @entity26 in our " @entity27 " -- as well as some insider facts about the movie that 'll make even the most hardcore fans feel a little more informed before heading into the arena			1
happy " @entity5 " ! the games @entity27 101 : every year in post-apocalyptic @entity34 , two tributes , aka children , from each district are selected in a public reaping to compete in the win - or - die @entity5			2
but every 25 years , there 's a @entity12 , where a dark twist makes the games even more treacherous			0
as punishment to heroine @entity43 ( @entity44 ) -- who not only outwitted the @entity5 , but also ensured her partner @entity45 ( @entity46 ) survived too ( unprecedented ! ) -- the @entity12 finds them back in the arena , competing against other past winners			1
as if that were n't enough , there 's also a love triangle , family drama , a score to settle , several districts to save and an uprising that ca n't be quieted			1
with evil monkeys and even more evil victors from previous games to battle , it 's a lot for one movie to tackle , but the tributes in " @entity64 " are more fully - formed characters , and they help set the story apart and keep the conflict interesting			1
expert tip : these games are getting darker and sexier			2
yes , the very premise of kids fighting to the death for the public 's amusement ensures that there 's a dark thread throughout the entire story , but the look and feel of " fire " is darker as well , with new director @entity80 amping up the action and suspense			2
and while costume designer @entity84 did n't allow tributes to be nearly nude as in the books , she did pull some form - fitting designer duds for them to wear			0
the fandom is growing up , and the movies are following suit			0
the big question : with several big names joining the cast , are there any new standouts ? @entity96 shines as cocky tribute @entity97 , and @entity99 makes an equally splashy ( and equally clothing - free ) entrance as @entity101 , who 's good with an axe , but takes a bit to warm up to			0
both have great moments with @entity10			2
' @entity5 ' theme park ? we have some ideas the love triangle @entity27 101 : so there 's this girl @entity10 and she 's a total badass , and she 's basically best buds with the male version of her , @entity116 ( @entity115 ) , but she gets sent off to the @entity5 with @entity45 , saves his life a million times and now all the viewers want them to be an item			1
so they sort of are			0
besides fighting for basic survival , the @entity12 gives them more time together to explore their relationship , for real and for the cameras			0
the love triangle is what grounds the entire series in reality , and it ai n't over until it 's over , so do n't expect anything to be decided halfway through the series ' four - movie run			1
expert take : @entity45 might not be such a bad option for @entity10 after all ! fans of the books were outraged that -- spoiler alert ! -- @entity10 ended up with @entity45 after so clearly having a stronger connection with @entity116			1
@entity45 always seemed like too much of a damsel in distress for our @entity10 , but in " @entity64 , " @entity45 is stronger and more independent -- and he can swim , so thankfully you wo n't have to see a near - drowning when they enter the water - filled arena			1
we wish he 'd get a skill a little more exciting than painting his body with mud to be camouflaged , but we 'll take any improvement on the character we can get			0
the big question : what about @entity116 ? while @entity116 is once again on the sidelines for most of the movie , he does have a particularly haunting scene in " @entity64 " that stays somewhat true to the book			1
the big difference ? this time the changes leave the door open for @entity116 to really make his presence ( and his intentions with @entity10 ) known in the two - part " @entity11 " final installments			1
they 've got @entity115 -- they 're going to use him ! a brief history of young adult literature the @entity169 @entity27 101 : while the tributes from the districts must compete to take their next breath , residents of the @entity169 are the 1 %			0
their excess knows no bounds , but they 're still human			0
while they felt like caricatures in the first movie , " @entity64 " reveals some chinks in the otherwise bedazzled armor , all thanks to @entity10 and her act of rebellion that 's now sparked a revolution			1
expert tip : yes , @entity186 ( @entity187 ) is still the most stylish tribute sympathizer , but @entity25 is more lovable than ever			0
in " @entity5 , " @entity190 ( @entity189 ) epitomized everything the @entity169 stood for : fashion , material things , excess and an obliviousness to the real issues in the districts around them			2
but as the stakes of the games are raised , so are @entity190 's concerns , and seeing cracks in her very colorful @entity203 helps make her more than a one - note character			0
we saw glimpses of her conscience in the books but , onscreen , @entity189 takes her from unemotional escort to compassionate cog in the wheel			0
the big question : who 's the new big bad ? after the execution of " @entity5 " gamemaker @entity217 ( @entity218 ) , who ignored orders and let both @entity10 and @entity45 win , @entity215 ( @entity216 ) steps in -- and he 's not going to make the same weak mistakes as his predecessor			1
with direct orders from president @entity225 ( @entity226 ) to make sure @entity10 does n't survive the @entity227 , he becomes the scariest new villain in the @entity169 and the biggest potential threat			2
the role feels tailor - made for @entity216			0
with the @entity34 rebellion in full swing , and @entity10 as their poster child , there 's more to prove in this 75th @entity5 than ever before			1
alliances will be tested and monkey mutts and @entity238 will terrorize the returning victors , all while the clock is ticking to save their families , their districts and themselves			0
@entity44 was @entity46 's first			0
