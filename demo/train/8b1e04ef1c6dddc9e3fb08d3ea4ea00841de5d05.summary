the @entity2 prison camp survivor who is the focus of a best - selling biography , " escape from @entity6 " said he changed parts of his life story , shaping them to hide from his trauma and shame			1
shortly after escaping from @entity2 , @entity11 formulated what he called a " sanitized " version of the his life , which he repeated for almost 10 years and subsequently became a book , which was published in 2012			1
that book describing his time in a @entity2 prison camp became a best - seller , made him a key witness before the @entity22 and grabbed headlines around the world			1
but last month , @entity11 revealed that parts of his story were not true and that he spent most of his life in @entity2 at a different prison camp , @entity28 18 , rather than the total control zone that formed the title of his biography			1
while @entity11 stands by his allegations of torture and abuses by @entity2 , his admission stirred controversy about truth and trauma among defectors			2
the text of the book , " escape from @entity6 " wo n't be corrected , according to the @entity43 , which was the newspaper where its author , @entity44 worked when he initially interviewed @entity11			1
however , a new foreword will be added to the ebook and future prints , wrote @entity44 on his website			2
" @entity11 told me he is now determined to tell the truth			2
regrettably , he has told me this before			0
it seems prudent to expect more revisions , " @entity44 wrote			0
but the author also acknowledged the role of psychological trauma for @entity11 , who is missing part of his right middle finger and bears scars of torture			0
" trauma victims like him tend to struggle with the truth , especially in the linear narrative form that journalists , judges , and policy makers are best able to understand			0
the memories of trauma victims are often fragmented and out of sequence , and the stories they tell can be shields behind which they try to hide , " he wrote			0
@entity11 said he would 've covered up the inaccuracies in his life story " forever if my father had n't appeared in the video			1
" in october 2014 , @entity2 uploaded videos on @entity74 featuring @entity11 's father who disputed his son 's widely publicized life story			1
the video raised suspicions among other survivors of @entity81 who questioned @entity11 's story			2
and some of those questions still persist including how he escaped and found his way to @entity85			0
those questions may never be answered with any certainty			0
" raised in a dysfunctional family in a secret prison , badly educated , and tortured , he is a flawed eyewitness to the savagery of the world 's last totalitarian state , " wrote @entity44 .			0

@entity11 made a " sanitized " version of his life story after escaping
he decided to *consistently* tell this version until @entity2 released video featuring his father in 2014
a new foreword will be added to book " escape from @entity6 "
