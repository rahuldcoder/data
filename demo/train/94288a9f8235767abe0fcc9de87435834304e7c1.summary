-- after stabbing , slashing and pummeling countless enemies , @entity1 will slay his final @entity3 next year			1
@entity5 is set to announce that the next season of its historical drama " @entity1 " will mark the show 's final outing			1
the upside : creator @entity12 promises the remaining episodes will be spectacular ( see the final season poster and teaser video here )			1
" this season is bigger than anything we 've attempted , " @entity12 says			1
" the scope and scale is just amazing			0
we 're dealing with massive battles between thousands of people			0
we hope to leave people feel satisfied			0
" @entity12 says he 's been 90 percent certain for months that the upcoming third season -- subtitled " @entity27 " -- would be the last for " @entity1			1
" creatively , the writer - producer assures that the timing will result in a strong tale			0
the historical foundation for the rebel leader 's journey , he says , lends itself to wrapping up the show sooner rather than later			1
" looking at the story in the history books , it 's wave after wave of @entity40 senators going after @entity1 who are defeated until [ @entity40 general @entity41 ] comes in , " @entity12 says			1
" there 's only so many battles you can put a spin on			0
so let 's pick out the most interesting moments in this struggle and lay out a clear narrative for @entity1 and his rebellion			1
i wanted to lay out a strong forward narrative with a strong antagonist			0
" " @entity1 " may wrap sooner than many fans might like , yet the historical drama actually survived longer than most expected			1
the show has had a wild and difficult run since it launched on @entity5 two years ago			1
the first season was a phenomenon			0
its violent comic - book imagery may have been inspired by the hit film " 300 , " but " @entity1 ' " operatic computer - assisted visual style and profanely quotable @entity67 dialogue quickly established the show as singularly unique			1
ratings started modest , then climbed with nearly every episode , eventually hitting about 6 million viewers when including all encore airings and viewing platforms			0
tragedy struck after the first season when the show 's breakout star @entity76 was diagnosed with @entity78 's lymphoma			1
pre-production on season two was halted			0
a short - order prequel sans @entity76 , " @entity87 , " kept the show functioning while producers and the network hoped for the actor 's recovery			2
eventually , the role of @entity1 was turned over to newcomer @entity89 , who led the show 's recent second season			1
" this show has always been a challenge , " @entity12 says			1
" we 've faced some unique challenges and tragedies			0
i 'm particularly thankful to @entity5			2
any other network , if the show 's lead actor had fallen ill and eventually passed away , they would have canceled the show			1
@entity5 felt like we owed it to the audience and to @entity76 to finish the tale			2
" in the most recent season , @entity1 led his rebel band of slaves to victory against the @entity3 at @entity109			2
@entity110 and defeated his longtime nemesis @entity111			0
as first reported on @entity0 , the new season adds @entity113 as an ambitious young @entity114 and @entity115 as @entity41			1
@entity12 says @entity41 will introduce a truly formidable enemy to help drive next year 's drama			1
" @entity41 is kind of like the @entity40 boogieman we 've been talking about for the last three seasons , " he says			0
" we meet him in episode one and you totally get that this is a guy who â € ” maybe he ca n't equal @entity1 in a one - on - one fight , but he 's just as shrewd and smart and dangerous as @entity1			2
" @entity1 will leave behind a legacy of having stretched the boundaries of series television , between expanding the use of green - screen technology ( the show has never shot one frame outdoors ) and proving hard - r sex and violence can draw an audience when mixed with compelling storytelling			2
there was , and remains , nothing quite like the show on tv			0
" i would much rather end a series with the audience wanting more than limping to the finish line , with only the die - hard fans sticking around for the wrap up , " @entity12 says			2
" we want to make the 10 best episodes we can			0
i ca n't wait for everybody to see it			0
" update : @entity12 says he has a new show in development at @entity5 that could be the successor to @entity1			1
we 're hearing the mysterious project 's working title is @entity157			0
the series is described in industry circles as a " @entity161 - like video game meets @entity163 's @entity162			0
" the writer - producer says the show is n't expected to be another fully immersed green - screen production like @entity1			2
@entity5 says the project is still in very early stages , but obviously we 're looking forward to whatever @entity169 makes next			2
