@entity1 , @entity0 -- authorities dropped a mandatory evacuation order sunday for neighborhoods threatened by a strained lock on a southeast @entity0 canal , but still recommended people stay away			1
" as there is still a potential threat , even though reduced , a voluntary evacuation remains in place until the @entity16 deems the lock stable and safe , " the president and sheriff of @entity11 announced late sunday morning			1
" the lock authorities feared would fail was on a man - made canal that juts off the @entity19 , near the @entity21 state line			1
the river has been swollen by rain from last week 's @entity24 , forcing authorities to relieve pressure on the structure by releasing water saturday and sunday			1
earlier sunday , @entity11 president @entity29 told @entity2 the water level at the lock has been reduced " tremendously " since saturday night , and " we feel a lot better			2
" but the waters were still rising sunday afternoon			0
@entity35 stopped by a boat ramp around the corner from her home periodically , counting off heel - to - toe steps from the waterline to the top to track the river 's rise			2
" when i first started , it was like , 14 , and now i 'm down to probably 10 , " @entity44 said			0
the river " is starting to come up slowly , but there is some concern			0
we are trying to take all precautions			0
" forecasters predict the @entity19 will crest monday at 19.5 feet , more than five feet above flood stage			1
that will result in " major flooding " of at least two subdivisions near the banks and threaten areas in the southeastern corner of the parish , according to the @entity60			0
@entity62 homeland security secretary @entity61 visited the parish on sunday , during a trip that also included stops in @entity21 where she met with that state 's governor and other officials			2
president @entity69 will be in @entity0 on monday for a briefing with local officials and to tour flood - damaged areas in @entity73			1
what 's left of @entity24 , meanwhile , soaked in and around the @entity75 on sunday , bringing stormy weather from @entity77 , @entity78 , to @entity79			1
the storm 's remnants have brought much - needed rain to parts of the lower @entity84			1
but the system skirted most of the @entity84 and @entity86 states where this year 's drought -- which the @entity88 reported last month was affecting a majority of the @entity62 mainland , the most since 1956 -- has been most devastating			0
" certainly , it helped some locations in our far eastern counties in @entity98 , but there was very little beneficial rain , " said @entity92 , a @entity60 meteorologist in @entity93			2
nearly all of @entity98 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 fall under the worst two drought categories			0
@entity24 dumped heavy rain across southern @entity101 last week , with some flooding reported around @entity109 and @entity110			1
but the northwestern city of @entity112 , which is nearly 11 inches below its normal rainfall totals for the year , got just over an inch , @entity92 said			0
flood warnings remained posted for parts of two northeastern @entity101 counties along the @entity118 on sunday			2
parts of @entity102 and @entity120 saw up to six inches of rain saturday , and the @entity60 issued a flood warning sunday for parts of southern @entity120			1
@entity24 is blamed for at least 19 deaths in @entity125 and at least four more in @entity0 and @entity21 after making landfall last week as a category 1 hurricane -- on the seventh anniversary of @entity129 -- near the mouth of the @entity131			1
the storm posed the first real test to @entity134 following a $ 14.5 billion federal effort to reconstruct the city 's flood control system after it failed during @entity129 in 2005			2
@entity129 killed nearly 1,800 people , most when the storm overwhelmed the levee system and flooded the city			0
though much weaker than @entity129 when it came ashore , @entity24 moved slowly and dumped enormous amounts of rain on @entity0 and @entity102			1
in @entity146 , near the mouth of the @entity131 , homes and businesses flooded after a parish - maintained back levee failed			1
officials were intentionally breaching levees in strategic areas in the parish , in hopes of getting " the bulk of this water out in five to seven days , " @entity146 president @entity149 said saturday			0
hundreds of thousands in the region were without power early sunday , including at least 320,000 @entity161 customers , officials said residents began returning home over the weekend in @entity164 , @entity21 , where @entity166 troops rescued hundreds trapped by rising waters brought on by @entity24			2
@entity169 returned home saturday to find more than four feet of water inside her home			0
" clothes , my laptop , a bunch of baby stuff , pictures , " all ruined , she told @entity2 affiliate @entity172			0
" all the furniture is ruined			0
" @entity2 's @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 contributed to this report .			0
