-- tar balls found on @entity4 beaches monday and tuesday are not from a massive oil spill off the coast of @entity7 , the @entity1 said wednesday			1
" a sampling of tar balls discovered on beaches at @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity12 , and @entity16 in the @entity17 , @entity12 , were flown by a @entity19 jet based in @entity20 , @entity12 , to @entity21 , @entity22 , tuesday for testing and analysis , " a @entity1 statement said			1
" the results of those tests conclusively show that the tar balls collected from @entity4 beaches do not match the type of oil from the @entity32 oil spill in the @entity33 , " the statement said			1
" the source of the tar balls remains unknown at this time			1
" however , " the conclusion that these tar balls are not from the @entity32 oil spill incident in no way diminishes the need to continue to aggressively identify and clean up tar ball - contaminated areas in the @entity4 , " said @entity1 capt. @entity35 , commanding officer of @entity36			1
@entity43 authorized the use of the @entity45 on tuesday to begin cleanups of any oil pollution on @entity4 shores and established a unified command made up of members of the @entity1 , the @entity51 , the @entity52 , and state and local officials to manage the tar ball response , the @entity1 said			1
the tar balls nevertheless have raised fears that oil from the @entity33 spill is headed to the coastlines of @entity4 and beyond			1
researchers and federal officials seem to agree that a plume of oil is being dragged into the @entity33 's @entity64			1
the current flows through the @entity66 between @entity67 and @entity33 , and then northward , where it loops just south of the @entity4 and travels to the west side of the western @entity70 , according to meteorologists			1
the @entity72 issued a statement wednesday saying satellite images show the oil is in the @entity64			1
" with these images from space , we have visible proof that at least oil from the surface of the water has reached the current , " @entity76 of @entity77 , the @entity78 , said in the statement			2
a new tracking forecast prepared by four experts relying on five computer models shows that part of the oil may reach the @entity4 in five to six days , and @entity20 , @entity4 , five days after that , sen. @entity92 , @entity4 , said in a statement tuesday			2
" while i always hope for the best , this is looking like really out - of - control bad , " @entity92 said			0
the forecast cited by @entity92 assumes the @entity64 's persistence and does not take into account dispersion and evaporation from the oil spill , @entity0 meteorologist @entity96 said			1
it remains to be seen how much oil has entered the current			0
in addition , he said , " the @entity64 is much warmer than surrounding water , which would cause oil to evaporate at a greater rate than it is evaporating near the source of the spill			1
" also tuesday , @entity51 shut down fishing in a larger part of the @entity33 over which the federal government has jurisdiction : a total of 45,728 square miles , which is 19 percent of the @entity33 , @entity51 administrator @entity112 said			2
an undersea oil well has been gushing an estimated 5,000 barrels of oil a day ( 210,000 gallons ) into the @entity33 since late april , when the drill rig @entity32 blew up and sank about 40 miles off @entity7			2
some estimates have put the amount of oil spewing from the well far higher			0
eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the explosion and sinking , and the cause has not been determined			0
samples taken by scientists offshore have raised concerns that large plumes of oil are settling below the surface			2
but federal officials said the results have not been fully analyzed			2
some of the oil has washed ashore on the @entity7 coast			0
the @entity139 said tuesday that the slick was 50 miles off the @entity142 coast			0
@entity144 meteorologist @entity143 said tuesday that based on satellite imagery , " the oil is definitely in the @entity64			1
... the only question is how much oil made it in			0
" others , including @entity112 , said the oil was poised to enter the current tuesday but had not yet done so			0
once it does , scientists say it could reach @entity4 in as little as four and as many as 10 days			0
once in the @entity155 -- waters between @entity4 , @entity67 and the @entity70 -- onshore winds would be required to push the oil onto shore , along with oil getting into an eddy on the edge of the current , @entity112 said			2
the oil might not actually make it to @entity4 , depending on current patterns , @entity143 said			2
" the currents right now in the @entity33 are changing rapidly , day by day			0
it 's kind of an unstable situation			0
" @entity168 , associate professor of optical oceanography at the @entity170 , said scientists " do not have a very reliable , sophisticated 3 - d model to capture what 's going on on the ocean bottom			0
" most efforts have been concentrated on the surface of the water , he said , and different depths have not been observed			0
@entity168 said he and other researchers are headed to the spot where the oil meets the @entity64 and will collect samples and measure water properties on wednesday			1
according to the @entity51 website , tar balls are remnants of oil spills			1
when crude oil floats on the surface of the water , it is torn into smaller patches covering a wider area by winds and waves			0
the oil undergoes a process called " weathering			0
" the lighter components of the oil evaporate , and heavier components are left behind			0
some crude oils mix with water to form " an emulsion that often looks like chocolate pudding " that is thicker and stickier than the initial oil , @entity51 said			0
" winds and waves continue to stretch and tear the oil patches into smaller pieces , or tar balls			1
" the tar balls can travel hundreds of miles , according to the website .			2

@entity1 tested tar balls from @entity4 , @entity214 ; source is unknown , it says
@entity217 made of federal , state , local officials created to manage response to tar balls
@entity72 says satellite images show oil now in @entity33 's @entity64
researchers headed to the spot where oil meets @entity64 to collect samples today
