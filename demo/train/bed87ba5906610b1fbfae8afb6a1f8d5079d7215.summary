-- @entity2 goalkeeper @entity1 achieved the rare feat of saving two penalties in a major football final to help her side beat @entity7 1 - 0 sunday to win @entity8 2013			1
@entity1 kept out spot kicks in either half with substitute @entity11 scoring the only goal of the match in @entity14 in @entity15 just after the break			1
it was enough to give @entity18 an unprecedented sixth straight @entity20 crown , with the last two under legendary former player and now head coach @entity22			1
an uneventful first half came to life when @entity7 were awarded the first of their penalties as @entity28 hit the turf under challenge from @entity31			2
penalty save @entity1 , incensed by the earlier award of a corner to @entity7 just before the penalty incident , channeled her aggression to keep out @entity38 's penalty with her knee			1
@entity18 took the lead just after the halftime break with @entity11 tapping in from close range after excellent work by @entity31			2
@entity7 responded with a surging run from @entity45 brought to an abrupt end to lead to the award of a second penalty			0
this time @entity49 stepped up to attempt to score , but her effort was too close to @entity1 , who fended it away			0
@entity18 enjoyed more good fortune when @entity54 's cross was turned in by @entity55 , but she was rightly flagged for offside			0
deserved winners but the reigning champions were deserved winners , with @entity61 's late low shot and an earlier header from @entity63 both hitting the woodwork			0
still looking for their first olympic gold medal , @entity18 have dominated at @entity68 level , winning eight of the 11 championships staged , with @entity22 being involved in them all			0
the result also continued two - time winner @entity7 's losing run in @entity8 finals to @entity18 , this there fourth and doubly frustrating thanks to @entity1 's heroics			1
@entity7 had also beaten @entity18 in the group stages of the competition , but could not repeat the feat when it really mattered .			0

@entity18 win @entity84 women 's championship
beat @entity7 1 - 0 for sixth straight title
@entity2 goalkeeper @entity1 saves two @entity89 penalties
@entity11 scores only goal of the match in the second half
