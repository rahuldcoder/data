the data were posted to the website @entity10			0
by late wednesday morning , that site had been suspended			0
the hack was seemingly intended to urge @entity3 to tighten its security measures			1

" our motivation behind the release was to raise the public awareness around the issue , and also put public pressure on @entity3 to get this exploit fixed			2
it is understandable that tech startups have limited resources but security and privacy should not be a secondary goal			0

@entity3 did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment			2
last week , @entity50 -- a group of " white hat " hackers , meaning they do n't exploit the security gaps they find -- published what they said was code that would enable such a hack			2
the @entity58 group said @entity3 implemented " very minor obstacles " after that			1
" we know nothing about @entity58 , but it was a matter of time til something like that happened , " @entity50 wrote wednesday on its @entity62 account			0
" also the exploit works still with minor fixes			0
" in a blog post friday , @entity3 appeared to minimize the potential damage from such a hack , claiming that it would require a " huge set of phone numbers , like every number in an area code , " to match usernames to numbers			1
" over the past year we 've implemented various safeguards to make it more difficult to do			0
we recently added additional counter-measures and continue to make improvements to combat spam and abuse , " the post read			0
