-- in a city that changes as fast as the weather , it can be easy to overlook @entity5 's past			1
but on a winding street in @entity8 , one of the city 's oldest neighborhoods , a house painted brilliant blue stands out			2
the " @entity17 , " a @entity19 tenement building from the 1920s , is at the heart of a cluster of historic buildings that paint a picture of old @entity5			1
home to the @entity23 , an eclectic museum and community center that offers tours of historic sites in the area , the building provides an important glimpse into the neighborhood 's rich history			1
a block away , 50 - story highrises loom and preservationists worry about the impact of gentrification on the neighborhood 's character			1
" we want local people to tell local stories , " says @entity38 , a volunteer tour guide who has lived in @entity8 for almost three decades			2
" if you come back in a few years , this neighborhood may have completely changed			2
" the @entity17 itself , which packed working class families into tiny rooms after it was built in the 1920s , is the first stop on the heritage tour			1
tenement houses like these were once common in the neighborhood and the city			1
now , along with two other tenements next door , the @entity17 is one of the few remaining			1
temples , post offices , war in the surrounding blocks , other old buildings , like a tiny 1847 temple and a prim 1915 post office , are slipped between apartment towers			2
of note is @entity68 , a @entity69 built in 1863 and an oasis of incense - scented calm			0
the @entity23 also offers a nighttime " haunted tour " that shares " spooky tales " of the neighborhood 's most eerie sites			1
the @entity77 bombing and occupation of @entity5 during @entity80 fuel stories of ghosts in @entity8			0
" people come for the fun but they also learn about the history , " @entity82 says			0
the two or two - and - a - half - hour tours , all led by community locals , cost hk $ 60 ( $ 7.75 ) per person , with private group tours for a minimum of hk $ 600 ( $ 77 )			1
visitors should schedule tours in advance over phone or email ( see below )			2
nonprofit and school groups receive reduced rates			0
the @entity23 also organizes concerts , movie nights and art workshops on thursday nights			0
people regularly wander into its welcoming , living room-esque space , which is full of old knickknacks and historic books donated by neighbors who 've moved out			2
renovation and preservation upstairs , the @entity17 is in the middle of a government - supported renovation to preserve its architecture and improve living conditions for residents , some of whom lack air conditioning and even toilets in their century - old flats			1
while there are other historic renovation projects underway around the city , the @entity17 effort is unique in that original residents will stay in their homes , says @entity130 , a @entity131 professor who consulted on the project			1
" we 're not preserving an old house and its original culture , we 're preserving a living community , " @entity130 says			1
renovation plans were drawn up in consultation with locals			2
after construction is complete in 2017 , the @entity23 will be joined by two new restaurants in the @entity17			1
until then , there are plenty of good dining options in the surrounding blocks			0
dining changes the pawn , a restaurant and bar housed in an 1888 pawn shop building , has an outside terrace and roof seating			0
( the pawn is currently closed for renovation , but scheduled to reopen in october with a menu from @entity157 celebrity chef @entity156			2
) @entity158 , a bar that opened three years ago in a former car repair shop across the street from the @entity17 , has a long list of cocktails and excellent shrimp paste chicken wings ( hk $ 55 / $ 7 )			1
its neon - lit vibe is straight out of ' 70s @entity5 tv dramas , and its walls are adorned with classic movie posters			0
" old things are being destroyed , " says @entity170 , the bar 's owner			0
" i wanted to protect and keep the memory			0
" some complain that new bars and higher rents are threatening mom - and - pop noodle joints and tea shops , where locals enjoy cold milk tea ( dong nai cha )			0
" the whole area is changing			0
it does n't match with the local residents , " @entity82 says			1
" for us locals , they 're making things more expensive			0
" a cheap option is an evening of snacks and beers on the sidewalk in front of the @entity17 , a nighttime hangout for the community			1
the rattle of games of mahjong regularly mix with laughter echoing down the street			0
@entity200 , who has lived in the @entity17 and its adjoining tenements for 18 years , says he has seen big changes in the area : lots of new faces and new highrise buildings			1
but the changes he notices are also cultural			0
" in the past , more people used to come out and eat and talk to each other like this , " he says			0
" now , most people go home and close their doors			0
