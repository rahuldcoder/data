@entity0 -- apparently president @entity2 does n't need an @entity3 ; he 's got an aide for that : @entity6			1
at the @entity8 ( @entity9 ) leaders ' retreat in @entity12 , @entity13 , on saturday , a print pool reporter was within earshot of a brief exchange between the president and an @entity3 owner , @entity19 prime minister @entity18			1
" so you like your @entity3 ? " @entity2 asked			1
the @entity19 leader nodded and asked @entity2 if he had one			1
" these days mostly i have someone carrying my books			0
so that 's my @entity3 , " @entity2 said , referring to personal aide @entity25			1
@entity2 said as much in a @entity28 interview last month			1
" i have an @entity6 , who has my books , my newspapers , my music all in one place , " he told the newspaper			0
not everyone has an arsenal of human apps like the president 's : a personal aide , several advisers , cabinet secretaries , a press shop and military leaders at his beck and call			0
@entity2 may not have a personal @entity3 , but he 's not too disconnected from @entity47 's latest technological craze			1
according to the pool reporter , @entity48 , the president told @entity18 that he recently bought an @entity3 for first lady @entity50			1
at a rally in @entity53 last month , the president was approached by someone with an @entity3 that said , " mr. president , sign my @entity3			2
" @entity2 penned his signature with the swipe of a finger instead of a pen			2
@entity2 is the first president to carry a smartphone with @entity62 and e-mail access , but the public rarely sees him using his blackberry			2
he may be considered tech - savvy , but the @entity66 is n't			2
the president 's @entity67 , the large wooden partner 's desk built from the timbers of the @entity73 exploration ship @entity74 , has a telephone but conspicuously no computer			0
so what does the president do when he needs one ? on at least one occasion , the president borrowed his personal secretary 's computer			0
the @entity83 posted a photo of the president sitting at personal secretary @entity87 's desk			0
he was due to deliver remarks that day and made last - minute edits on her computer			0
maybe there 's not an app for everything .			0

@entity2 and other world leaders are in @entity13 for the @entity8 *summit*
a pool reporter hears @entity2 and the @entity19 prime minister talk about @entity3
the @entity66 has a phone , but no computer
