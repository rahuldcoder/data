-- @entity2 forward @entity1 has accused former teammate @entity3 of deliberately trying to injure him with a stamp during their @entity6 defeat to @entity7			1
@entity1 has accused @entity3 of trying to deliberately injure him			1
@entity3 , who left @entity2 for @entity7 in july for a fee in the region of $ 40 million , seemed to lunge at the @entity11 international who sustained a cut on the side of his head which required treatment			1
match referee @entity16 did not get a clear view of the incident in a match which @entity7 won 4 - 2 at @entity20 and @entity3 escaped punishment following the @entity1 incident , although he was booked for his goal celebration in front of the @entity2 fans after he ran the full length of the pitch			1
@entity29 chief executive @entity28 has confirmed the governing body will take a " good close look " at the two incidents involving @entity3 who scored in the 80th minute			1
but van @entity1 directed his ire towards @entity36 international @entity3 , who spent three - and - a - half years at the @entity37 before his move to @entity7 , with a statement on the official @entity2 web site			1
do you think the @entity29 should punish @entity3 for his conduct ? sound off below " i am sad and disappointed by my former team - mate @entity3 's mindless and malicious stamp on me , " @entity1 said			1
" he set out to hurt me and i feel lucky that i have not suffered a greater injury			2
the contact was only centimeters from my eye			0
we are both professional footballers and i know that the game is physical			0
i , too , have made hard and sometimes mis - timed challenges but never with the intention of hurting an opponent			2
he set out to hurt me today			2
" i knew he was aiming for a collision because he changed the angle of his body to allow contact to be made			0
he moved backwards when his natural momentum would have taken him forward			2
i find that deeply disrespectful			0
he has shown a real lack of class today , to me and the fans			2
" i do feel lucky that i have not received a greater injury			0
the contact was only centimeters from my eye			0
i have not received an apology from him , there were no words exchanged afterwards			0
he had his own agenda today and that is bad for football			0
it 's bad for the game we all love			2
" i want to make it clear that this has nothing to do with the result of today 's match			1
we do not hide from that disappointment but i need to speak out about this behavior			0
" @entity3 later apologized for his goal celebration in front of the @entity2 supporters as it later emerged that a match steward needed hospital treatment after being hit by a flying object in the wake of the reaction by the @entity97 fans			1
city manager @entity98 called for the authorities not to come down too hard on the 25 - year - old @entity36 international for the celebration			0
" we have to cut @entity3 a bit of slack -- he is an emotional guy and was caught up in the moment			1
it was a fantastic goal and great finish , " @entity98 told the club 's web site			1
" he has already apologized on camera and that is the right thing to do because obviously it can be provocative			0
" we just have to understand that he is an emotional guy and he wanted to share the moment with the fans in the corner with whom he has a special affinity			0
it is the same area that the @entity2 fans were in so there is the potential for people to see it as the wrong thing to do			1
we recognize that and so does @entity124			0
