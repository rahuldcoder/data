-- last year , @entity1 distributed more than 84 million printed copies of the @entity3 around the world to students , hospitals , members of the military and , of course , hotels , where they are a ubiquitous sight in bedside tables			1
starting this month , however , the @entity13 is modernizing that mission at one of its hotels , replacing the paper tomes with electronic versions of the @entity3 loaded on @entity20 e-readers			0
each of the 148 rooms at the chain 's @entity23 in @entity25 , @entity26 , will be outfitted with a kindle with @entity28			1
guests can use the e-ink devices to catch up on scripture , as well as purchase and read any other books available in the @entity20 store			0
the hotel was chosen for the pilot program because of its rich literary and publishing history : it 's a few blocks from the @entity40 of @entity25 , one of the largest independent libraries in the @entity43			1
if it 's a success , @entity13 could expand it to other locations , and other hotels might follow its lead			2
the hotel 's @entity3 - on - a - @entity20 initiative has no connection to @entity1 , a @entity52 - based evangelical group and association of @entity55 professional men founded in 1899			1
however , the nonprofit group has no reservations about the hotel 's program			0
" anything to put the @entity3 in people 's hands is a good thing , " @entity1 spokesman @entity60 said			1
" it is a fascinating idea , and i 'm sure somehow , some way , its time will come for us			0
but right now just the paper version is the best for what we do			0
" @entity60 pointed out that paper books are more economical for large - scale distribution			0
each @entity1 costs the organization about $ 5 to print and distribute			1
although there are many free e-book versions of the @entity3 floating around online , a 6 - inch @entity20 e-reader retails in the @entity79 for $ 109 ( or about $ 139 in the @entity43 )			1
given the high price tag , @entity23 is keeping close tabs on the devices			2
just like with fluffy hotel robes , the full cost of any pilfered @entity20 will be charged to a guest 's credit card			1
for the first two weeks of the program , the hotel is allowing guests to download any other religious texts they like , up to $ 8 in value , for free			0
if guests purchase other books to read , the cost will be charged directly to their rooms			0
however , they ca n't take the books with them , and the @entity97 are wiped clean between visitors			2
" as downloads will be synced to the hotel 's account , guests will only be able to read the downloaded book during their stay , " an @entity13 representative said			0
guests not keen on paying for an e-book they might have to abandon halfway through can choose from the 15,000 free titles in @entity20 's free e-book collection			0
the @entity1 ' hotel @entity3 project began in the @entity79 in 1908 and has spread to 194 countries around the world			2
the group estimates it has distributed 1.7 billion bibles in the project 's 104 - year history			1
while distributing pricey e-reading devices is n't much of a threat to @entity1 , it 's likely that the proliferation of e-reading features on all mobile devices could make a dent in demand .			2

@entity23 in @entity26 may be the first to replace bedside bibles with @entity97
@entity1 , which gives out 84 million bibles a year , supports the project
a bible costs @entity1 $ 5 to print and distribute ; a kindle in the @entity43 costs about $ 139
stolen kindles will be charged to the guest 's credit card
