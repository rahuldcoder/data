@entity0 ) -- @entity2 paceman @entity1 took six wickets including a hat - trick as @entity5 were skittled for 260 on the first day of the @entity7 series at the @entity8 in @entity9			1
the home side were 25 without loss in reply at the close with @entity15 15 not out and @entity16 on nine , the openers having survived a testing half hour to round off a superb day for @entity18 's men			1
but it was the heroics of birthday boy @entity1 , 26 today , which put them in a strong position with his hat - trick the 11th by an @entity2 in test cricket history			1
@entity5 were 197 for four wickets when he struck , removing @entity27 for 67 then @entity28 and @entity29 for ducks in successive balls			1

i was just trying to bowl fast , pitch it up and get it straight and they were three good players to get out , " @entity1 told @entity38			0
" it 's a good list to join , @entity2 hat - tricks in test cricket			2
" a battling 76 by @entity45 until he was the ninth man out to @entity47 debutant @entity46 lifted @entity5 to some respectability			2
journeyman left - arm spinner @entity46 , a surprise inclusion in the @entity2 team , wrapped up the @entity5 innings in the same over as he bowled @entity52 to finish with two wickets for 41			0
@entity5 had begun their previous series in @entity55 , which resulted in a 5 - 0 thrashing , in disastrous fashion with paceman @entity58 's well - chronicled wide			2

blog : @entity5 's @entity7 hopes could turn to dust @entity27 and @entity68 set about repairing the damage on a wicket with a green tinge and helpful to the bowlers , but with the score on 41 , all - rounder @entity16 bowled @entity68 for 29			0
@entity74 played well for his 43 , but @entity1 accounted for him and @entity75 for just 4 in his second spell as he found the right length to bowl on the slow surface			0

@entity45 , who had been in fine form in the warm - up game in @entity87 , continued where he left off , but attempting to up the scoring rate only chipped a @entity46 delivery to @entity16 in the covers			0
@entity5 , who hold the @entity7 having beaten @entity55 on home soil in 2009 , have gone into the series as narrow favorites but will have work to do on the second day of the first test , if they are to prevent the home side from building up a sizeable first innings lead .			1
