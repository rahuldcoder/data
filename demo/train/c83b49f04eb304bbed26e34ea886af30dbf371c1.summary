@entity0 -- @entity2 stands at a crossroads in its efforts to preserve the @entity6 rainforest as the government considers controversial legislation governing land use			1
for most of the past decade , it has made a dramatic reduction in the rate of deforestation , providing a model of how it could be tackled in other rainforest areas such as @entity17 and @entity18			1
the @entity6 rainforest covers a huge area , roughly half as large as the @entity20 , with about 60 % of it in @entity2			1
it is estimated that nearly a fifth of the @entity25 forest has been lost since 1970 ; figures from @entity2 's space research institute , @entity27 , show that 4.1 million square kilometers ( 1.58 million square miles ) of @entity25 forest were still standing in 1970 , compared with 3.35 million square kilometers ( 1.29 million square miles ) today			1
like in many developing nations , there is pressure on the natural environment from commercial and agriculture interests			0
according to @entity27 , in 1995 , nearly 30,000 square kilometers ( about 11,550 square miles ) were cleared -- that is an area about the size of @entity36 or the @entity20 state of @entity38 -- but in 2011 , the rate of loss had been reduced to just over 6,000 square kilometers ( about 2,400 square miles )			2
last year saw the lowest annual clearance since yearly @entity27 surveys began in 1988 , and @entity2 is aiming to reduce deforestation even further to 3,500 square kilometers annually by 2020			1
see interactive maps of @entity2 's land use @entity2 's environment ministry credits its success to a combination of support for sustainable activities and near - real - time satellite monitoring of forest regions that allows it to target illegal operations with extra agents			1
but environmentalists worry that these results , brought about by efficient use of technology allied with a political will to slow clearing , could now be put at risk by an overhaul of @entity2 's @entity64			1
protesters say the new code , which could come into effect after a crucial vote tuesday , reduces protection and weakens enforcement laws			0
" the changes in the new @entity64 will reduce this protection			0
combined with the strong presence of ' ruralists ' in the @entity77 -- congressmen linked to the agri - business sector -- there is good reason to be very concerned for the future of forests in @entity2 , " said @entity73 of @entity2			1
" deforestation in the @entity6 has many drivers			2
loggers come first to take the most precious timber and finance the building of rough , illegal roads			0
then come cattle ranchers , burning what is left and planting grass			0
cattle ranching is often used to guarantee the ownership of the area by land grabbers , " she said			0
at present , @entity25 government statistics show that about 30 % of the country 's land is given over to agriculture			2
the power of the rural lobby is acknowledged by those close to the @entity25 government , but the environmental fears are also rejected			0
@entity106 , special adviser to the @entity25 environment minister , @entity107 , said , " it is true that the rural caucus representatives have much power ; everybody knows that			0
much of the gdp comes from the @entity25 agriculture and livestock			0
it is a sector of great importance for the country			0
" the new proposal includes all the government 's requirements			2
it sets out regulations to restore the land			0
it includes components such as social interest , public utilities and low environmental impact			0
" but i think this is the best proposal that can come out for both sides			0
environmental groups are concerned , but the rural caucus , on the other hand , are worried , too			2
so it is clear that neither side will be satisfied with any code that the government approves			0
" @entity106 said farmers must keep 80 % of their forested land -- they will be able to clear only 20 % -- and may have to use some of their land for reforestation			0
but farmers are worried about the future of their businesses and are keen to modernize the existing code , which dates to 1965			0
no one from the @entity25 farmers ' body , the @entity152 , which represents 2,300 rural trade unions , was available for comment , but the group 's website calls for a balanced approach that safeguards conservation and food production " because this production depends on the welfare and progress of the @entity25			2
" protecting the rainforest has attracted celebrity backing for more than two decades			0
pop singer @entity165 and his wife , @entity166 , set up the @entity167 in 1989 after seeing the destruction of the @entity6 rainforest and its impact on indigenous peoples			0
both the @entity167 and @entity172 have urged @entity25 president @entity173 to use her veto to block the law change			1
they are concerned about the threat to the huge range of animals and plants found in the world 's rainforests : scientists from the @entity184 estimate that at least two - thirds of all @entity186 's terrestrial species are found in tropical forests			1
@entity188 2012 also marks a significant junction half a world away in @entity17 , which has significant forest areas			1
in may 2010 , @entity192 signed a letter of intent pledging about $ 1 billion to help @entity17 reduce deforestation			1
but there have been delays in implementing the plan , and @entity172 says it is not working			1
the agreement was designed to help @entity17 with its commitment to the @entity202 's global @entity201 ( @entity203 )			1
it called for the establishment of an " independent institution for a national monitoring , reporting and verification system , " a two - year moratorium on all new concessions for forest clearance and enforcement of laws on illegal logging			2
rainforest home to vast treasury of life @entity218 , an area of @entity17 that has seen widespread forest destruction , was chosen as a pilot project			1
studies by @entity222 and the environmental think tank @entity223 show that the lowlands of @entity218 and @entity225 have lost more than 40 % of the rainforest cover since 1990			2
in the same period , more than 17 % of @entity17 's total forest area has disappeared			1
the studies also show that there has been a resurgence in clearing since 2000 , but it has not reached the levels of the 1990s			0
attempts to halt deforestation in @entity17 are much less advanced than in @entity2 , which started its drive in the 1980s			1
@entity172 says there are major loopholes in the @entity17 moratorium , saying the safeguards are inadequate with no review of existing concessions , and criticizes the lack of a good monitoring system			1
" in short , in our opinion and analysis , the moratorium has not been working well in halting deforestation in @entity17 , " said @entity244 , @entity172 forest campaigner in @entity17			1
" the land rights issues are also a major problem in forest governance ... creating more and more conflict and human rights violations			2
it means the existence of indigenous peoples and local peoples are at risk as , currently , the government tends to give more priority to the large scale industries of forestry , plantation and mining , " he said			2
the @entity17 government insists that it is committed to @entity201 + and introducing a host of measures to slow deforestation and reduce emissions			1
in a keynote environment speech in september , president @entity273 dedicated his remaining three years in office to enhancing the forests of @entity17			2
" we must attain both development and the management of our forest simultaneously , " he said			0
" this is because forest management is tightly intertwined with the livelihood of our people , with our food security , with the availability of wood and fuel			0
" apart from the moratorium , we have built indicative maps that are important to the implementation of @entity201 +			0
these maps will also facilitate the resolution of decades - long problems of land use and land tenure			0
" a spokesman for the @entity17 government adds that it is working on the maps and new concessions permits , and to determine the extent of forest damage and how to control it			1
but can @entity17 match the progress made by @entity25 ? @entity172 's @entity244 says @entity2 's strong point has been to implement better forest governance , backed up with good monitoring and serious law enforcement			1
it is the monitoring issue that is also acknowledged as key by the @entity223			2
" reliable monitoring and information are essential for protecting forests , " said the institute 's @entity310			0
" @entity17 recognizes the value of good data and is working to develop such a system			1
" what the world really needs is consistent , real - time deforestation data for all forested countries			1
" @entity322 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 has made a dramatic reduction in the rate of deforestation
environmentalists worry that its progress could be put at risk by changes to forest law
@entity172 is also concerned that @entity17 's measures to halt deforestation are not working
the @entity223 says the world needs consistent , real - time deforestation data
