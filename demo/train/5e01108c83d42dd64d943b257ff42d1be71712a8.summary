after days of relentlessly questioning @entity0 about his role in the @entity3 , the @entity6 " investigator " suddenly switched subjects			1
" they started in on why i came , " @entity7 recalled			1
" i said it was because i wanted to find out what was really going on in @entity6			1
then they began to focus on my asking our guides to help me locate old soldiers or their relations or descendants if we got to @entity17			2
" they tried to make it into the main reason for my visit			2
i tried to get across that the business of me contacting people was just an aside			2
it was n't the main thing			2
" you 're lying ! you 're guilty of espionage			2
you 've got to be honest with us			0
" " i apologized for trying to reconnect			0
i continued to maintain that the purpose was just to get a better understanding of @entity6			1
but that was the ' crime ' in their eyes â€” illegally using the tour as a cover			0
" @entity39 contacts the @entity6 were particularly interested in an email that @entity7 had sent before his trip to his elderly wartime contacts in @entity43			1
the " investigator " asked about the " @entity45 comrades			0
" did they have an office ? how big was it ? how much time had @entity0 spent with them ? " i was not completely forthcoming , " @entity7 said			1
he sought to downplay the group and his connection to it , describing the @entity43 office as small and nondescript , and lying about how much time he 'd spent with the former guerrillas			0
he was worried that his interrogators would realize that he was n't telling the whole truth , but they never did			0
the " investigator " also accused @entity0 of " criticizing " the @entity59 , referring specifically to his conversation with fellow tourist @entity61 in which he noted the resources @entity6 's government wasted on monuments in such an impoverished country			1
clearly , their guide @entity69 , who always seemed to be listening in to their conversations from her seat in the back of their minivan , had reported that comment to security officials			0
' major crimes ' in mid-november , @entity0 was told again that he committed " major crimes " and that he was to prepare for a meeting with a " senior official " where he would make a formal " confession			1
" " they said : ' this is the guy who will decide whether you stay or go home			0
' " in the days before the meeting , the investigator and the interpreter made @entity0 write out what he would say			1
" the statement used words they dictated , " @entity0 said			1
" i did not try to tidy the language			0
i wanted it clearly understood [ by those outside @entity6 ] that these were not my words , though in my handwriting			1
" the meeting took place on november 9 , 2013 , in a large room on the ground floor of the @entity106 , where @entity7 was being held			1
@entity0 was wearing a short - sleeved shirt , but the interpreter told him that was not formal enough , so he changed to a long - sleeved one			1
@entity0 was instructed to be very respectful , to stand up when the official entered the room , and then to read the statement			1
the official appeared to be in his 50s , wearing a well - tailored uniform , with a serious , formal demeanor			0
with video cameras rolling and his hands shaking , @entity0 began			2
confession ? " during the @entity3 , i have been guilty of a long list of indelible crimes ... as i killed so many civilians and @entity128 [ @entity128 ] soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the @entity59 during the @entity3 , i committed indelible offensive acts against the @entity59 government and @entity6 people			1
" although 60 years have gone by , i came to @entity59 on the excuse of the tour ... shamelessly , i had a plan to meet any surviving soldiers ... i also brought the e-book criticizing the @entity59 and criticizing @entity59			0
" i realize that i can not be forgiven for any offensives but i beg for pardon on my knees ... please forgive me			0
" at the end of the statement , @entity7 bowed to the camera			2
he then signed it , and stamped the paper with his thumbprint			0
" you make a confession because you do n't have any choice , " he said			0
" they have the key			0
and there is n't any duplicate			0
" but having now done so , he thought the @entity6 would move to release him			2
" i had a calendar on the wall , and i counted those days , and i got closer and closer , i was figuring there is no way i am still going to be here for @entity160			0
@entity0 remained confined in his hotel room			2
in moments of depression , @entity0 began to wonder if he would ever be released .			1
