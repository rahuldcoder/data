-- when you break up with someone , how do you expect the people in your life to treat your ex ? on a recent sunday , i read the " @entity12 " column in the @entity8 which explored that topic in an essay by @entity11			1
@entity11 had an amicable , cold - turkey breakup with his girlfriend of five years , and then found himself morosely following her life in the aftermath via @entity17			1
when his " technophile " grandfather joined the social networking site and befriended his ex -- because of their shared love of @entity25 , it seems -- @entity11 was angry			0
the column ends with a bit of a whimper -- @entity11 confronted his grandfather , who ended up quitting @entity17 entirely -- but it got me thinking about how we expect our family members and friends to treat our exes , and how we expect their family and friends to treat us , whether the breakup was amicable or not			1
when my ex and i broke up , i did n't have much to worry about on this front			0
while i was friendly with his friends and he was friendly with mine , we did n't really have mutual friends , so it was n't like anyone was in a position of " choosing sides			1
" my family had never been close with him because we had n't spent too much time with them as a couple , so they had no interest in keeping in touch with him			1
and really , given the way things went down , everyone in my life kind of hated his guts			0
a few of my friends were @entity17 friends with him before we broke up , and when we split , most of them asked if they should defriend him or not			1
i said , " no , " because obviously someone needed to be keeping tabs on his relationship status changes , as well as post and tag photos of me looking happy for him to see			0
so i 've never been in the position of having to really " think " about how i wanted my friends to treat my ex. they 've been doing it right since the second we broke up			1
however , one of my primary concerns when we broke up was how it was going to affect my relationship with his mom			2
even though i had n't " done " anything , would she still feel comfortable maintaining contact with me ? and even if she did want to remain a part of my life in the months after the breakup , what about when my ex brought home a new girlfriend for her to meet ? would her friendship with me get in the way of her developing a bond with a new , potential daughter - in - law ? and what did he think of his mom still keeping in touch with his ex -- the very same ex who has , well , given him a piece of her mind on this very site ( all of which could have been read by his mom ) ? the @entity0 : is fighting healthy in a relationship ? all of this was weighing heavily on me in advance of my 30th birthday			1
though my almost - mother - in - law and i had vowed to keep in touch , i had n't spoken with her since before i found out and wrote that my ex had likely cheated on me with his coworker ( and lied about it ) and had also lied about an incident early on in our relationship involving his ex-girlfriend			2
since the last time we spoke , i had written about all of these things , as well as sent my ex an extremely angry and accusatory email ( which he did n't acknowledge ) , and i was worried a little that he had maybe bad - mouthed me to his parents -- i.e. , told them i was crazy -- in an attempt to cover his butt , should they confront him about the things i wrote about ( in the event that they still read @entity0 )			2
i hesitated to check in with them because i did n't know what kind of reception i would get			0
i was pretty confident his mom knew me well enough that she would n't believe any lies he might tell and , despite everything , i had a hard time really believing my ex could be that vindictive			2
turns out , my instinct was right -- his mom texted me on my birthday , as did his sister			2
it was a wonderful birthday present , knowing he had n't tried to taint their view of me and that they still very much wanted to keep in touch			1
the @entity0 : when is the ideal time to get married ? i talked to his mom a few days after my birthday and we avoided the subject of my ex almost entirely , though she did say she had mentioned to him that she had wished me a happy birthday			0
she said he seemed a little weird about it , which i suppose is fair and normal			0
i respect him for not getting angry or demanding that we cease contact , i respect his mom for , well , not really caring whether it bugs him , and i am doing my best to respect the relationship ( s ) in general , by not making him a topic of conversation when we do speak			0
of course , if i actually did want to discuss my ex with his mom -- and aside from a burning curiosity about whether he has introduced his parents to the aforementioned coworker , i really do n't -- that would be a sign that the friendship between us is n't the healthiest thing for me , as i take the final steps in moving on with my life			0
so , as far as keeping up relationships with an ex 's family and friends goes , proceed with caution			1
