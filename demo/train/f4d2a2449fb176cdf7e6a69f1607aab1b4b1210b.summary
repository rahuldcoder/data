@entity1 , @entity2 sen. @entity0 embraced his libertarian roots in @entity2 this weekend , speaking unapologetically about his apprehension about foreign intervention and stoking the fire in one of the libertarian movement 's biggest crusades : auditing the @entity11			1
in his first trip to @entity2 this year , just under a year before the caucuses , the @entity13 @entity12 and potential presidential candidate ventured into familiar territory , rallying young voters and libertarian - minded supporters who turned out big for his father 's presidential campaigns			1
@entity0 found friendly audiences at the end of a stormy week filled with negative headlines over comments he made about vaccinations and swirling controversy involving one of his advisers in @entity2			1
the crowds this weekend were a marked contrast to the social conservative audience that packed a @entity1 theater two weeks ago to hear 10 hours of speeches from a hoard of other potential candidates at the @entity39			2
the @entity11 was hardly mentioned at that event , and the rhetoric on war and the fight against @entity44 was more forceful and hawkish that the positions @entity0 took this weekend			1
' one loud voice ' last fall , the senator struggled to communicate his stance on the war against terror			2
at first he urged restraint against @entity44 , but after @entity53 journalists were beheaded by the group , @entity0 began supporting limited action			1
he eventually , in a committee vote , voted " no " to authorizing war against @entity44 , saying he felt the bill was too open - ended , and it was a vote he stood proudly by this weekend as he used it to separate himself from his potential competitors			2
" you 're going to get a choice on who the nominee is for the @entity12			2
you 're going to have nine , 10 , 15 , 20 who are eager to go and want troops on the ground , " he said at the " @entity68 " rally friday , which took place at a winery in @entity1			2
" they want 100,000 troops on the ground			2
" " i can tell you there will be one loud voice in our party saying , think of the unintended consequence			2
think about what we 're going to accomplish and whether it will work before we go to war			0
' i promise you that will always be something i take very , very seriously			0
" the theme of " acting before thinking " was the way he described the @entity94 administration 's foreign policy , for which he squarely placed blame on @entity96 , hammering her for supporting military action in @entity98 and calling for the arming of @entity101 rebels			0
at a saturday morning event , held at a bar and grill in @entity105 , @entity0 acknowledged that he " begrudgingly " thinks the @entity53 should intervene in the @entity106 to protect @entity53 interests , such as the embassy in @entity109 and consulate in @entity111			1
" but i do n't want to send 100,000 gis in			0
" that should be left to regional fighters , he said , before launching into a fiery diatribe			0
" and do n't get me started about @entity116			0
there need to be 20,000 @entity116 fighting that war because they 've been a problem			0
" building a brand with so many @entity12 candidates likely to echo each other 's talking points in the next year , @entity0 has tried to run in his own lane by shaping his libertarian foundation into a selling point that says he 's best poised to expand the @entity12 base			1
to stop the " dismantling of the country , " @entity0 said it 's going to take someone with a nontraditional approach			1
" it 's not going to take a ho - hum , same - old , same - old , we 'll - get - a - @entity12 - that 's - a - little - bit - different - than - the - @entity137			2
it 's going to take someone who can unite the country			0
when our party looks like the rest of @entity53 , we 're going to win			0
" rep. @entity149 , a @entity12 success story in @entity2 who won a largely @entity137 district in november , introduced @entity0 at the saturday morning event and said he was attracted to @entity0 's efforts to broaden the @entity156 tent , though he stressed in an interview with @entity3 he would n't be endorsing anyone this early on , if at all			1
@entity160 of @entity105 , who identifies as a @entity140 , said @entity0 " might have some success " attracting voters like her but argued he needs to " stop saying mean things about @entity96 , " saying it only turns off those same voters			1
courting the youth later saturday , @entity0 popped by by the @entity169 men 's basketball game in @entity170 before dropping in at a watch party hosted by @entity172 and @entity173 , a group founded by his father , ex- rep. @entity174			1
" i think the energy in any political movement is the youth , " @entity0 told @entity3 , explaining why he wanted to kick off his year in @entity2 with a libertarian - leaning focus			1
the senator , however , was dressed in blue -- staying true , he said , to the @entity181 , where two of his sons go to school			0
" i do have an @entity169 pen on my jacket , but i 'd get in too much trouble if i had an @entity169 shirt on , " he told the students			0
staff from his political committee were at the ready at the watch party , providing students with smartphone covers emblazoned with the logo " @entity198 " and collecting names and contact information			0
standing at a podium with a minibar close by , @entity0 spoke freely about what he considers the dangers of civil forfeiture and the malpractice of the @entity205			1
" the @entity206 is not for the prom queen			0
the @entity206 is n't for the high school quarterback , " he said			0
" the @entity206 is for those who are unpopular , for those who want to speak their mind			0
" young people also were prevalent at the " @entity68 " rally			0
the @entity11 is already audited by a third - party accounting firm arranged through the inspector general and partially by the @entity217			2
but @entity0 reintroduced legislation that would give full auditing power to the @entity217 and would require regular reports to @entity221			1
@entity0 was noticeably more comfortable shaking hands and taking pictures with voters than he has been in the past			1
the first - term senator and ophthalmologist is known for his no - frills , less - than - warm style			2
but while meeting with students on saturday , @entity0 frequently smiled and avoided looking down at his shoes in between photos , as he 's been known to do			1
at the restaurant earlier saturday , he occasionally would ask questions and engage in small talk			0
@entity236 , who went to both the @entity105 event and the " @entity68 " rally , said he liked @entity0 's unusual style			1
" he 's not a brass polished politician , not a walking mannequin ... a lot of candidates , it 's like they have multiple personality disorder , " @entity236 said			0
" @entity0 is very consistent			1
" still , @entity0 was more celebrity than @entity247 to some voters			1
he was asked to sign five baseballs at the @entity105 event and a copy of @entity252 from when he appeared on the cover back in october			2
others were more ardent supporters of @entity0			1
one pair of friends drove from @entity257 , @entity258 -- a five - hour drive			2
a week of headaches @entity0 was courting the very same base this weekend that became the focal point for a damaging story this week by @entity264 , which profiled the negative reputation of @entity266 , a @entity0 adviser who was at the helm when activists in @entity2 's liberty movement took over the state party in 2012			1
the report quotes party officials who had strong misgivings about what they described as @entity266 's divisiveness			0
but @entity0 defended his adviser and expressed confidence in @entity266 's connections with the liberty movement and @entity281 conservatives			1
" there are always going to be people who have chosen other candidates or who for one reason or another hold a grudge			0
but i think really with both @entity247 and ( @entity0 's other @entity2 adviser , @entity291 ) there 's a broad reach to a broad swath to the party , " @entity0 told the @entity289 on thursday			1
@entity0 spent several days trying to clear up comments he made that lent credibility to theoriesâ € ‹ that vaccinations cause mental disorders			1
that , combined with negative attention over how he shushed a female interviewer , sparked a wave of criticism from pundits over whether the senator is ready for prime time			0
" @entity0 is not inspiring a lot of confidence that he his ready for a national campaign , " said @entity156 strategist @entity310 , who works for @entity311 , a consultant recently hired by @entity312			2
" you can coach a candidate on messaging and how to give a speech but what you can not coach is thick skin			0
he needs to toughen up and that starts by not talking down to people interviewing him			0
we 've already got that in the @entity325			0
" @entity0 defends shushing interview but the supporters who showed up at his events this weekend appeared unconcerned with the senator 's recent dust - ups			1
" i do n't take one week at a time , " said @entity331 of @entity332			0
" i look at the big picture			0

@entity0 kicks off his first event in @entity2 this year with events that appeal to libertarian - minded voters
effort builds on the foundation that his father established in the state during his 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns
