@entity0 , @entity1 i started working at the ebola treatment center the day it opened , september 19			1
i cared for children , men and women with @entity9			1
every day more than 100 new patients came in			1
i was determined to make the outbreak go away from my country			1
every day i saw thousands of people from my country dying			2
blood in their vomit , blood coming from their eyes , their ears , their mouth , their nose ... one day in november , i felt sick			2
i started to vomit , my body ached			2
i thought it was an ulcer like before			2
my mother said , " @entity27 to the hospital			2
" we called my boss and he said , " bring her immediately			2
" they isolated me , took blood samples , and treated me with iv fluids because i was vomiting seriously			2
within 24 hours , they came back			2
they were all wearing protective clothing and equipment			2
it was then that i knew			2
tears streamed down my face			2
immediately they took me into the red zone , the same place where i treat my patients			2
i was now like them			2
in three days , i could not walk			1
i was blind , paralyzed , unable to talk or eat			1
i had a sore throat , body aches and my whole body itched			0
blood started coming out of my eyes			0
i was awake with pain all of the time			0
once , my soul left my body			0
i saw my body lying down			0
i thought , i am going to die , i will not make it			0
every single day i cried			0
@entity9 is a very dangerous disease			1
during this time , my parents were quarantined			0
no one could visit me			0
all of my belongings -- my bed , my clothes , my shoes -- were burned			0
the first thing that happened when i started to feel better is that i was able to eat			1
i realized , " @entity64 still has plans for me			0
" it took one month to relearn how to talk , to walk , to eat			1
when i left the hospital in december , it was not easy			0
my mom , dad , brothers and sisters embraced me , but others turned their back on me			0
my friends were scared they would get @entity9			1
people pointed at me in the street			0
my parents and i had to leave our community and find a new place to live , far away , where people did not know			0
i often say @entity9 is a demonic disease , because of what it does to you when you are sick and what it does to you after			1
i have many friends who died from @entity9			1
in the hospital ward where i worked , all my medical colleagues who got @entity9 died except me			1
one of my friends lost every member of her family			0
@entity9 is also demonic because of the stigmatization you face as a survivor			1
i always try to stay positive , even though it is hard for me , physically and emotionally			0
after surviving , i returned to work in the same hospital ward where i worked before , treating @entity9 patients and giving them hope			1
i tell them i was a victim of @entity9 , and i survived			1
when they refuse medication , i make an example of myself			0
i say , " i want you to do the same thing to be like me			0
" just before returning to work , i met @entity107 director - general , dr. @entity106 , when she visited our hospital			0
she hugged me and it felt so good			0
her gesture showed everyone that they do not need to be scared			0
you should not reject survivors , you should embrace them			0
then , dr. @entity116 invited me to give the keynote address at the @entity107 's @entity118 in @entity119			0
i am twice a survivor			0
i lived through war in my country			1
during the war , my sister was shot and killed in front of me			1
i fainted and they set our home on fire			0
the heat from the fire woke me up and i survived			1
i faced stigmatization then , for two years in @entity131 , where they told refugees like us to sit on the floor of the bus			0
in many ways , @entity9 is worse than war			1
with war , at least some of your family has a chance to survive			1
with @entity9 , your entire family can be wiped out			1
even if i have an enemy , i will never pray they become infected with @entity9			1
i will never think that			0
i want to help @entity9 survivors			1
i started a non-governmental organization , @entity147 , to provide counseling for @entity9 survivors facing stigmatization and to conduct public awareness campaigns			1
we are looking for a partner to help us build @entity153 drop - in centers for @entity9 survivors to come for counseling , support and training			1
and i would like to further my education , so that i can pursue a career in my country helping people prevent and survive diseases like @entity9 .			1

@entity164 cared for children , men and women with @entity9 in @entity1
when she caught disease , she said : " i could not walk . i was blind , paralyzed , unable to talk or eat "
