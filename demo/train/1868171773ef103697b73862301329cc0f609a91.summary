-- the family of an @entity3 woman who went missing in @entity4 nearly two weeks ago is in mourning after learning that @entity7 police found her body saturday			1
@entity9 wept during a phone call with @entity0 , as he waited in @entity4 to go with police to identify the body of his wife , @entity12			1
@entity7 police found the @entity16 woman 's body near ancient stone walls in @entity4 's @entity19 district , the semi-official @entity13 reported			1
police suspected she had been killed at another location			2
police told @entity0 's sister network @entity22 that the body of the 33 - year - old mother of two showed signs of stab wounds			1
however , the police chief of @entity4 , @entity28 , said @entity12 died from a blow to her head			1
at least nine suspects had been detained in connection with @entity12 's disappearance and death , @entity13 reported			1

" you 're hoping that she 's ok wherever she 's at , that she 's not hurting , that she 's not cold , that she 's being fed , " @entity9 said , choking back tears			0
" its difficult what 's going through my mind , if our hopes and prayers are not answered			0
it is difficult when you have two children that look up to you , and you have to do your very best to stay strong regardless of what happens			0
" @entity12 flew alone to @entity4 on january 7 after a friend at the last minute canceled plans to accompany her			1
" she did a lot of researching about the area , about where she was going to stay , the safest places to go and the time of day to travel , " friend @entity67 said			0

" you 're admiring pictures , but you 're getting acquainted with people that you 've never met before , " @entity9 said			0
@entity12 's brother said he had been worried about his sister 's solo trip			1
were just like ' always be mindful of what you do , be aware of your surroundings			0
do n't get too comfortable to the point where you drop your guard down , ' " @entity48 said			0
but @entity48 and @entity12 's husband said @entity12 was determined to complete challenges that she set for herself			1
as an example , they described how she competed in a triathlon several years ago , despite being a weak swimmer , and despite the fact that she did not own a bicycle			2
instead , @entity12 completed the cycling leg of the competition by borrowing a mountain bike from her husband			1
after arriving in @entity4 , @entity12 's photo feed displayed images of @entity4 's beautiful skyline and historic landmarks			1

and she also had a tour guide that was helping her out there as well , who i know about and who i 've spoken with personally			0
" @entity12 returned to @entity4 on january 19			1
three days later , she went missing			0

days before her scheduled trip home , @entity12 spoke with her father , @entity128 , via @entity129 to remind him of her flight number and arrival time			2
when @entity128 went to the @entity132 , @entity133 , airport to pick @entity12 up , she did n't show , he said			2
the airline told him she had never checked in for the flight			0
" she kept in contact with us all the time , " @entity12 's mother , @entity136 , said			1
" and then not to hear from her ? it 's not like her			0
" after the tourist went missing , @entity7 police released a surveillance camera video of @entity12 at a shopping mall in @entity4 , flipping through her @entity145			1
the scenes from january 20 are the last known images of her			0
the manager of the small private hotel where @entity12 was staying reported last seeing her the day the surveillance video was shot			2
her @entity129 account , which she avidly used , went silent a day later			0
a day after that was when she missed her flight home			0
the time she last talked with her family , @entity12 was planning on january 21 to see the @entity158 and visit the @entity160 side of @entity4 , her husband said			1
the former capital of the @entity163 and @entity163 empires straddles the continents of @entity165 and @entity160			0
after @entity12 's family raised the alarm that she was missing , some of her belongings -- including her passport and medical cards -- were found in her room in @entity4 , though her @entity173 and @entity145 were not there , according to her husband			1
since @entity12 's disappearance , @entity7 police detained a @entity7 man she had been in contact with who was identified only by the first name @entity180 , according to @entity22			1
