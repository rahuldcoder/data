it was a sad day in the clown world when a " clown " at the @entity11 put on a mask in the likeness of president @entity4 and wore a broomstick attached to his behind to perform in a rodeo in @entity9			1
some would ask : how this is different from late - night pundits making mocking comments about every political person alive ? it is different in that it goes against everything a clown stands for and makes fun of our president in a way that is truly offensive on so many levels			1
as someone who has performed as a " real " clown for 32 years and has taught the craft to hundreds of clowns , i would like the world to know that we have a code of ethics that we adhere to so that our life of making the world smile goes on without hurting people			1
among the ethics is a ban on " blue humor			1
" this mean no sexual or racial humor			1
the joke always needs to be on us and never on an audience member			0
if someone is offended or made the " victim " of a joke , it is totally against what the clown community would consider funny			2
so what is this clown community and where do i get these ethics ? one of the main international clown organizations based in the @entity56 is @entity57 , @entity58			2
we are 3,000 members strong and are organized into clown " alleys , " groups that perform together			0
as part of our training , and really the training of most clowns , we have a strict code of ethics covering such things as drinking while clowning , cleanliness and remaining in character			1
we take offense at the actions of the rodeo " clown " because we are strictly trained not to offend anyone while " in clown			2
" the individual who took on the role of a clown in @entity81 might have made some people laugh , but it was at the expense of so many others			1
what of the children who were in the audience and being taught to respect our president and government ? what of every person in the audience who hates racism ? what of the officials of the state of @entity81 who are now the focus of national attention in this negative light ? forgive me for taking this forum to air another form of " clown " i find very offensive : the horror clown			1
in my travels as " @entity106 " the clown , i encounter many people of all ages who are afraid of clowns			2
perhaps some are afraid of anyone who is behind makeup , but most have had the experience of a house of horror where a person dressed as a clown has frightened them and , in doing so , has robbed them of fun and playful experiences for life			0
being a " real clown " takes training , money and a lot of time			2
we each develop a character that is an extension of ourselves			0
real clowns have clown hearts long before we put on makeup			1
our goal is to make the world a happier place			0
one part of our national organization , @entity138 , allows clowns go to places where there have been disasters and pitch in -- helping to distribute needed supplies but also helping to keep the spirits of people up			0
i am most proud when i come home having given a balloon flower to an elderly person who responds with a big smile or having taught a child who is in a hospital long - term the basics of juggling			0
and so what is there that i have described about " real clowns " that applies to the @entity81 rodeo performer ? absolutely nothing			1
as for the people in @entity162 who have said he would be welcome to perform there : please think about that and what you are really doing			0
i believe that people today desperately need a reason to smile and a chance to forget their troubles for a moment and laugh			0
these laughs are most cherished if they are only for fun and do not offend or hurt another human being .			0
