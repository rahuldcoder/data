in an announcement that triggered massive jubilation among supporters in @entity6 's @entity5 , @entity1 candidate @entity0 was declared @entity8 's new president sunday			1
@entity0 had more than 13 million votes in a run - off election , while @entity12 , who served as the last prime minister under ousted president @entity14 , had more than 12 million , election officials said			0
who is @entity0 ? @entity8 's largest @entity17 party , the @entity1 , lost its grip on legislative power earlier this month after the country 's highest court declared parliament invalid			1
the @entity1 dominated parliamentary elections in december , winning about half the seats			2
but @entity8 's interim military rulers -- who have long been at odds with the @entity1 -- declared full legislative authority in the aftermath of the ruling			1
however , @entity0 's victory in the presidential election puts the party in a position to reclaim power			0
what is the @entity1 ? the @entity1 is a religious and political group founded on the belief that @entity37 is not simply a religion , but a way of life			2
it advocates a move away from secularism , and a return to the rules of the @entity45 as a basis for healthy families , communities , and states			1
the movement officially rejects the use of violent means to secure its goals			0
however , offshoots of the group have been linked to attacks in the past , and critics blame the @entity1 for sparking troubles elsewhere in the @entity59			1

when was it created ? the @entity1 has been part of the political scene in @entity8 for more than 80 years			1
it was formed there by @entity68 in 1928			0
teacher @entity69 and his followers were initially united by a desire to oust the @entity72 from control in @entity8 , and to rid their country of what they saw as " corrupting " @entity78 influences			0
what is its history ? in its early years , the group concentrated on religion , education and social services , but as its membership grew , it moved into the political sphere , organizing protests against the @entity8 government			1
in the 1940s , an armed wing of the @entity1 was blamed for a string of violent acts , including the assassination of @entity8 prime minister @entity94 in 1948 -- shortly after he had ordered the dissolution of the @entity1 @entity69 himself was assassinated soon afterwards -- his supporters claimed he had been killed on the wishes of the government			1
the movement went underground in the 1950s , and decades of oppression by successive @entity8 rulers led many of the @entity1 's members to flee abroad , while others were jailed			2
the @entity1 grew throughout the 1980s as part of a general growth of interest in @entity37 , and the @entity110 - led invasion of @entity111 in 2003 saw a spike in membership			2
why is it important in @entity8 ? the @entity1 is the oldest and largest opposition group in @entity8			1

how influential is the @entity1 elsewhere ? there are branches of the @entity1 in countries across the @entity59 and @entity132 and @entity133 , including @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136			0

@entity145 , a member of the @entity1 in the 1950s and 1960s , developed the doctrine of jihad , and the radical group @entity148 is believed to be an offshoot of the @entity150 @entity1 .			2
