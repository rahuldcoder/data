@entity0 , @entity1 -- a new drug for melanoma has been shown to rapidly shrink malignant tumors in an early trial at @entity6 in @entity7			0
new drug inhibits @entity9 , the main driver of mutation in over 50 percent of melanomas			1
among 27 patients whom the experimental new drug was tested on , " 19 showed a 30 percent or greater reduction in tumor size , " dr. @entity13 , the lead researcher told @entity14 from a cancer conference in @entity16			1
melanoma develops in cells that produce melanin , the pigment that gives skin its color , and is the most serious type of skin cancer			1
currently the standard treatment for metastatic malignant melanoma is chemotherapy , which has only a 15 percent success rate , @entity13 explained			2
in his trial using @entity34 over 70 percent of patients had a response to the drug			1
" without reservation we can say this is a breakthrough in melanoma			0
we have n't seen a major breakthrough in this disease in the last 40 years , " said professor @entity42 , president of the @entity43			0
seventy - five percent of the patients who were treated with @entity34 had already received multiple treatments of other cancer drugs , all of which had failed			2
two - thirds of those patients also already had what @entity42 described as " very widespread metastatic disease			0
" " there were patients who were on oxygen or on continuous morphine who were off the morphine after one or two weeks of treatment , " @entity42 told @entity14			0
two patients , he said , even showed complete remission , such that all detectable melanoma " melted away			0
" the other two major benefits of @entity34 are that it can be taken orally as a pill and seems to have very mild side effects			1
the @entity34 complex works by blocking the activity of cancer - causing mutation of the braf gene , which is implicated in more than half of all melanomas			1
@entity42 praised the drug for being highly - selective unlike traditional " dirty " cancer drugs that have a wide range of side - effects			1
" the side effect profile looks very mild and we think it 's because it 's such a clean , super selective molecule and it 's an oral drug , and that 's a great asset , " he said			2
@entity81 , ceo of the drug 's maker @entity82 explained that it is because @entity34 is such a highly selective compound that " doctors can adjust the dosage to really shut down tumors , " whereas other cancer treatment drugs are frequently limited from working to their full potential because patients can not tolerate their toxicity levels			1
@entity34 is not a cure , but offers hope for alleviating symptoms and extending life			2
" i 've never seen this before in melanoma , " @entity13 said referring to the successful findings			0
" one thing we do n't know is how long these response are going to last , " he added			0
the next step will now be to test the drug in a larger trial of almost 700 people , scheduled to begin this month and to be completed by the end of the year			2
then a randomized test comparing chemotherapy treatment with @entity34 therapy will need to occur before			1
currently that is slated to take place across @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 in the first quarter of 2010			0
" we are working to make sure that within the shortest time possible we will satisfy the needs of @entity121 to get this drug available to melanoma patients as quickly as possible , " @entity42 said			0
early responses from peers have been supportive			0
in a statement dr. @entity126 said that " @entity128 and others have been investigating drugs that can block faulty @entity9 , so it is interesting to see the results from a small - scale trial of such a drug			2
melanoma is a very difficult cancer to treat and the results of this early - stage trial are promising , but larger trials need to be done before we know for sure how effective this treatment is			1

experimental new skin cancer treatment shows 70 percent effectiveness
@entity34 inhibits @entity9 , the driving mutation in more than half of melanomas
unlike chemotherapy the drug can be taken orally and has mild side effects
larger trials are needed to confirm results and test *safety*
