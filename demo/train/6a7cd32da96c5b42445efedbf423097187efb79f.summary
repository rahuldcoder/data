-- a large oil drilling platform is on its way to the @entity4 mine where 33 trapped miners are awaiting rescue and is expected to arrive later thursday or friday , an engineer overseeing the drilling said			1
according to @entity11 , the 42 - truck convoy carrying the drill was in the area of @entity13 , @entity4 , approximately 500 kilometers ( 311 miles ) north of the @entity15 mine			2
other pieces of equipment will arrive from @entity19 , @entity4 , and @entity20 , he said			2
the oil platform will be part of @entity23 , the third operation to drill to reach the miners			1
@entity4 mining officials have said they believe that drill will dig faster than the other drills currently at work			0
but they cautioned that the miners , trapped since august 5 , still may not be rescued until december			1
progress on the other two rescue operations was mixed , @entity11 said			0
the drill being used in @entity33 -- a type usually used in mining operations -- reached a depth of 171 meters ( 187 yards ) thursday , 40 more meters ( about 44 yards ) since an update given by officials wednesday			1
the @entity40 drill , usually used to drill water bore holes , hit a snag at 268 meters ( 293 yards ) , @entity11 said , when it struck a reinforcement beam used in the mine 's operations			1
the men have been trapped for 35 days now , 2,300 feet under the earth			1
when rescuers first found them , the miners told officials they had survived for more than 17 days by sharing a jar of peaches and small amounts of tuna and mackerel that were in their shelter			1
officials were weighing how to best proceed after the problem with the @entity40 drill but said the drill bit would have to be retrieved and replaced			0
" it was totally destroyed , " @entity11 explained			0
the @entity40 device , which had been drilling for less time than @entity33 's drill and had already surpassed its distance , also had a problem wednesday with a cable malfunction			1
the drill is widening a hole already drilled into the mine			0
@entity11 said that once it begins drilling again , it could reach its target -- a workshop used by the miners -- within several days			1
then a larger drill could be used until the hole is wide enough so that the miners can be hoisted out , one at a time , in a small cage			2
at @entity82 , the tent camp set up by miners ' families holding vigil , residents eagerly scanned the rocky horizon for any sign of the caravan bearing the @entity90 drill			2
" i wish it were here already , " said @entity91 , whose nephew is one of those trapped			0
as residents waited for the arrival of the newest weapon in the arsenal being used to rescue the miners , workers walked the route the convoy will take to make sure the heavy trucks will clear the winding road into camp			0
" just the logistics part is the tough part , getting the people and equipment to where you need it			0
we 've got to figure out the route [ and the ] power lines , " said @entity113 , who was coordinating the equipment 's arrival for @entity116 , a @entity117 oil drilling company			2
" we do this all the over the world , " @entity113 said , but always for oil , never before for trapped humans			0
" this is a first			0
