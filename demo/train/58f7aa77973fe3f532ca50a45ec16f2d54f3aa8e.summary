@entity108 , owner of a gift shop selling goods from t - shirts to plush dolls , said that " business is off by 35 percent , and people are not buying			2
" as i drive around town , i do not see a large number of closed - down stores			0
like other cities , @entity10 has seen big national chain closures like @entity120 and @entity121			1
yet at two of the area 's outlet malls , you would never know there is an economic crisis			2
i waited 10 minutes in line to enter the parking lot			0
in the suburbs where foreclosures are their highest , more businesses have closed their doors			0
as i looked for a house to rent i was surprised how a one - bedroom condo in downtown was the same price as a four - bedroom house only five miles away			0
real estate agent @entity139 said the city has a glut of homes and condominiums for sale or rent			2
she said her office has seen business double from four months ago because of the low prices			2
the agent said owners have either lowered prices , been foreclosed on or are selling the house for the amount owed to the bank			0
for one store in my new quaint neighborhood of @entity157 , business has never been better : @entity158			1
