-- two of @entity3 's key supporters in the @entity4 have acknowledged " real and serious questions " about @entity9 's compound in @entity3 , but defend sending money to that country nonetheless			1
during a @entity14 hearing wednesday assessing the limits of @entity17 policy in @entity3 , @entity11 chairman @entity10 , @entity12 , said that although he is " curious " about whether components of @entity3 's military or intelligence services were involved in protecting the compound 's infamous resident , the @entity17 should not rush to judgment that might ultimately hurt its national security			1
" no matter what we learn about the events that preceded the killing of @entity9 , we still have vital national security interests in this region , and we have worked hard to build a partnership with @entity3 , fragile and difficult and challenged as it may be at times , " @entity10 said			1
committee ranking member @entity34 , @entity35 , said that recent events have raised questions about @entity3 's reliability as an ally , but cautioned that it is " a strategically vital country with which we must engage			1
" " distancing ourselves from @entity3 would be unwise and extremely dangerous , " @entity34 said , because it would weaken @entity17 intelligence capabilities , limit @entity17 's ability to prevent conflict between @entity45 and @entity3 , and further complicate military operations in @entity47			1
@entity34 also pointed out that @entity3 is a nuclear - armed state , has a close working relationship with @entity50 , and is a neighbor of @entity52 , all of which he cited as worthwhile reasons to build stronger relations between @entity56 and @entity57			1
the @entity58 of 2009 , also known as the @entity10 - @entity59 , authorizes $ 1.5 billion in annual aid to @entity3 through 2013			2
critics question what that money is paying for			0
" @entity3 acts very irrational , " committee member @entity64 , @entity65 , said			2
" i mean , i leave there almost feeling like i 've had a @entity68 moment , you know , whenever i 'm there			0
" @entity64 advocated that the @entity17 " rearrange " its relationship with @entity3 to focus on routing out the remnants of @entity73 and other terrorist groups inside the country			1
hearing witness @entity76 , @entity77 advisor at the @entity78 , said the issue goes beyond war fighting			0
" you need strong diplomacy and strong signals sent : we will not tolerate an organization which is linked to @entity73 , that is killing @entity17 soldiers across the border in @entity47 , that is posing threats to @entity17 national security interests in the homeland			0
we will not allow you to continue to support this organization , " @entity76 said			0
other witnesses shared the view that a strategy shift is in order			1
@entity96 , @entity77 project director with the @entity97 , said the @entity17 ' certification requirements of the @entity3 partnership should ensure @entity3 takes firm action against violent extremist groups			2
" we would advise and very strongly urge @entity4 to condition military assistance on demonstrable steps to combat violent extremists , that go beyond just @entity73 , the foreign @entity73 , but also homegrown jihadis , " @entity102 said			0
@entity108 , co-founder and @entity77 senior associate with the @entity110 , said the @entity17 policies in @entity47 are hurting @entity3			2
" if authorities in @entity47 are unable to safeguard our military 's hard - won gains , we are obligated to ask how much more blood and treasure ought to be devoted to this cause , " @entity108 said			0
he said the two countries are " now very close to another divorce , " but it would be " a serious error in judgment ... to conclude that this relationship can not be salvaged			0

@entity10 says the @entity17 should not rush to judgment
@entity34 says @entity3 is " a strategically vital country with which we must engage "
