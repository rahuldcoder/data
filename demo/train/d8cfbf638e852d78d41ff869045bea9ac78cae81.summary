@entity0 -- information about how and when the government gathers and uses cell phone location data to track certain criminal suspects should be made available to the public , a federal appeals court ruled tuesday			2
at issue was whether the @entity9 could be forced to release once - sensitive records from past cases , following a lawsuit by the @entity13			1
a three - judge panel of the @entity15 said the public 's interest outweighed any privacy concerns raised by the government over their warrantless wiretapping			1
" the disclosure sought by the plaintiffs would inform this ongoing public policy discussion by shedding light on the scope and effectiveness of cell phone tracking as a law enforcement tool , " said the judges in their 35 - page ruling			2
" it would , for example , provide information about the kinds of crimes the government uses cell phone tracking data to investigate			0
" the @entity13 had filed a request under the @entity40 , asking for court docket information on current and past cases of those tracked using mobile location data			2
the civil liberties group also wanted to know about the government 's policies , procedures and practices when using the tracking technology			1
the government will now be compelled to release the docket information in cases where there was a conviction or public guilty plea			2
for cases that resulted in an acquittal , dismissal or were sealed for national security purposes , the appeals court ordered a lower court to re-examine the issue			0
the government had argued it has the authority to obtain the cell phone data from private telecommunication companies without prior judicial determination of probable cause			0
the larger constitutional question of whether the @entity73 administration 's warrantless wiretapping policy is proper was not addressed by the appeals court			1
the current dispute , said the judges , was merely about public access to the information			0
shortly after the 9/11 terror attacks a decade ago , the @entity80 administration stepped up use of domestic covert electronic surveillance , aimed mainly at suspected terrorist activity			1
the government has strongly opposed efforts to disclose information about their covert surveillance program in certain classified cases			2
the @entity9 has raised what is called the " state secrets " defense , which allows courts to block lawsuits against the government on grounds that the litigation could harm national security			1
but the judges in the current dispute said the information here " contains little that is personal " and that any privacy invasion would be " marginal			0
" " the fact that information about these proceedings is readily available to the public reduces further still the incursion on privacy resulting from disclosure , " wrote judge @entity103			0
" the most that disclosure is likely to lead to is the fact of a single conviction , not a comprehensive scorecard of a person 's entire criminal history across multiple jurisdictions			0
" he noted such information can be readily found on the @entity119 and through the media			0
there was no immediate reaction to the ruling from the @entity13 or the administration			1
the @entity126 @entity125 in november will hear a separate case dealing with police use of a global positioning system tracking device for tailing criminal suspects in their vehicle , without a warrant			0
the case decided tuesday is @entity13 v. @entity126 @entity9 ( 10 - 5159 ) .			1

@entity9 will have to release some records , ruling says
@entity13 had asked about government 's practices
whether warrantless wiretapping is legal was not covered
@entity80 @entity142 had stepped up surveillance after 9/11
