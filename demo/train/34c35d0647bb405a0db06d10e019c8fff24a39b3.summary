-- @entity2 offensive lineman @entity1 has been on the defense since november after fellow @entity5 player @entity4 abruptly left the team citing emotional abuse by @entity1 on and off the field			1
@entity1 adamantly maintains the two were friends who just had a crass rapport , though an @entity2 - sanctioned investigation found racial slurs used by @entity1 and sexually explicit messages about @entity4 's mother and sister constituted a " pattern of harassment			1
" the report also concluded that the two developed " an odd but seemingly close friendship			2
" @entity4 - @entity1 investigation report released @entity1 took to @entity23 in a series of messages on february 12 to clear his name , including : " i 'm ready to move on with my life and career			1
i 've been dragged through the mud for months by my ' best friend '			1
" he would publicly apologize online -- again -- to @entity4 less than five days later			1
the public beef has caused some to question @entity4 's toughness and others to examine the harsh environment of the pro sports locker room			1
but it 's also worth acknowledging that the dynamic between @entity1 and @entity4 is n't so rare -- many of us have been embroiled in what pop psychology would call a " toxic friendship			1
" for @entity47 's 21st birthday , her good friend of more than 10 years sent her a self - help book on dating -- effectively throwing a burning match into the powder keg that was their relationship since seventh grade			1
" it seems tiny and ridiculous , but it came near graduation , when i was facing the prospect of being unemployed and moving back home , " @entity47 , now 22 , wrote in an e-mail to @entity0 from @entity55			0
" it was a reminder of another part of life that i am failing at -- my love life			0
" @entity47 wrote about her " toxic friendship " and subsequent fallout on the web journal @entity68			1
she attributes her self - deprecating sense of humor and fear of confrontation , in part , to the pair 's drawn - out , dysfunctional accord			0
" most of the time , she exploited that , she built on those jokes and got everyone to laugh at me , " she says			0
" she made me feel like i knew nothing , that i was a child and i was immature			0
" what you do n't get about @entity2 bullying what made the dynamic even more confusing , and complicated to stop , is that there were , of course , jolly times -- especially when nobody else was around to impress			1
but the dating book was the final chapter in their storied love - hate relationship			0
" you ca n't keep victimizing yourself like that , " she says			1
communication expert @entity99 decided to pen the book " @entity102 " after hearing many tales like @entity47 's			0
" the definition of friendship is admiration and respect , and if you do n't have those two , you have nothing , " @entity104 told @entity0			1
when friends become bullies there are two types of toxic friendships , says @entity104 : those that start out toxic , and those that start to require a hazmat suit over time			1
when a friendship starts out overly contentious or competitive , it 's worth asking why you 're pursuing it in the first place			0
you might be recreating an unhealthy pattern , perhaps modeling your relationship with a parent who belittled you as a stand - in for showing affection			0
" sometimes what we do n't resolve , we repeat , " @entity104 says			2
on the other hand , pals can simply evolve in opposite directions -- this is particularly true in friendships that have endured since adolescence			2
@entity139 , though , is n't inherently a bad thing			2
it 's more when there is a " discrepancy in personality and values " or a friend discourages success , says psychologist @entity148			2
@entity149 also wrote a book on prickly pacts , titled " @entity152 : surviving a breakup with @entity154			0
" " since friendships are voluntary relationships , it makes no sense that they bring you down , " she says			1
she stresses in the book that people make many friends in life but only a few stick for prolonged periods			0
those long - standing bonds , @entity149 says , are particularly hard to navigate -- or end -- because of the significant losses in cutting ties			1
" these people are like scrapbooks of our lives , collection of our memories			2
it 's very nice to be able to reminisce and have someone know your roots and know you in a different phase , " she says			0
an uncordial split could put mutual friends in an awkward situation			0
if the toxic friend 's nature is spiteful or vengeful , there 's also the potential that he or she could unleash a firestorm of secrets and confidences you shared through the years			1
but , @entity104 says , if that 's their nature , they 're probably already talking behind your back			0
" deny it or ignore it and distance yourself , " she says			0
" then again , as they say , do n't tell your best friend what you would n't want your worst enemy to know			1
" short of " dumping " the friend , @entity149 suggests there are other ways to attempt to ease the tension : take a break from the person by speaking and seeing them less frequently			2
if the other party is persistent or guilt - trips you for not being around , a little white lie about scheduling could be in order			0
@entity149 says it 's nice to want to maintain a longtime connection , but if none of these fixes work , the offended party must find a way to end it			1
although it might be hard to address awkwardness , try to be direct but ultimately kind			2
and never end a friendship impulsively			2
" you really need to think very carefully before you do it , " @entity149 says			0
" there 's no going back			0
people will never forget that conversation			0
" are you or have you been in a toxic relationship ? did you make amends or call it quits ? share your experiences in the comments below .			2

the " friend or foe " dynamic between @entity1 and @entity4 is n't so rare
some model toxic friendships on their belittling relationships from childhood
longtime friendships are particularly hard to end with the *storehouse* of memories
