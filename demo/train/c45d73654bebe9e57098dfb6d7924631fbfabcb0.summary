in a $ 40 million federal lawsuit , five people arrested recently in @entity2 , @entity3 , accuse police of using " wanton and excessive force " and treating @entity6 citizens " as if they were war combatants			1
" a complaint filed thursday alleges that police officers from @entity2 and @entity12 used unnecessary force and made unjustified arrests as they cracked down on protests after the shooting death of 18 - year - old @entity17 earlier this month			1
the lawsuit lists @entity2 police chief @entity19 , @entity12 police chief @entity20 , @entity2 officer @entity21 , several unnamed officers and the city and county governments as defendants			1
a @entity12 police spokesman declined to comment friday , referring inquiries to the county prosecuting attorney 's office			1
the @entity12 prosecuting attorney 's office told @entity33 it has no comment on the lawsuit			1
the suit -- which includes accusations of intentional infliction of emotional distress , negligent supervision , and assault and battery -- details circumstances allegedly surrounding several arrests between august 11 - 13 : -- @entity45 was about to buy an ice cream sundae at @entity47 when officers " in what appeared to be army uniforms , carrying rifles and sticks and wearing helmets " entered and ordered her to leave , according to the lawsuit			2
she was told to shut up , thrown to the ground and handcuffed after criticizing officers for the way they were treating her son , the lawsuit claims			2
-- @entity62 was walking to his mother 's house when a group of officers in military uniforms shot rubber bullets at him , the lawsuit alleges			0
he fell into a creek or sewer , the suit says , where officers " pounced on him , slammed his face into the concrete , and pushed his head into the water to the point that he felt he was going to be drowned			0
" -- @entity82 was shooting footage and holding his camera out his car window when an officer snatched his camera , " took out his memory card and threw it to the ground , " the lawsuit says			0
-- @entity88 and @entity89 were peacefully protesting , the lawsuit says , when police in riot gear fired tear gas and what appeared to be stun grenades in their direction , then " hurled racial epithets at them , while punching and kicking them the entire time			2
" @entity33 has not independently confirmed details of the arrests			0
police tactics to calm the crowds drew sharp criticism , including a rebuke from @entity6 attorney general @entity107			2
" at a time when we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community , i am deeply concerned that the deployment of military equipment and vehicles sends a conflicting message , " @entity107 said as the protests unfolded			0
as criticism of police tactics mounted , gov. @entity118 tapped @entity122 capt. @entity121 to head up security in @entity2 on august 14			1
this week , @entity121 said police were scaling back their efforts in @entity2 now that the situation has cooled			1
@entity20 , the @entity127 , told reporters on wednesday that he does n't regret his agency 's decisions to fire tear gas at protesters			0
that approach , he said , was much better than using nightsticks or dogs			0
even though president @entity136 has called for a review of military equipment sales to local police departments in light of the clashes between police and protesters in @entity2 , @entity20 said that such equipment is often necessary			1
" i never envisioned a day that we would ever see that kind of equipment used against protesters , " he said			0
" but i also never imagined a day in 28 years when we would see that kind of criminal activity spin out of peaceful demonstrations			0
