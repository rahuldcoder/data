@entity1 , @entity2 twelve people were killed friday in shelling in the eastern @entity2 city of @entity1 , an official with the pro-separatist @entity6 said , as the conflict between the military and pro-russian separatists escalated in the past week			1
@entity3 could not confirm 12 deaths , but its team in @entity1 saw seven bodies after a series of shell blasts near the center of the city			1
five bodies , concealed under sheets , could be seen at a spot by the @entity20 , where a local billionaire has organized food aid handouts by his staff			1
one man had died at the wheel of his car			1
a shell apparently hit near where dozens of people were waiting in line for much needed supplies			1
elsewhere , two more bodies could be seen where a trolley bus was hit			1
until now the fighting has largely been concentrated on the outskirts of the city , near the airport			2
but friday , the blasts moved significantly closer to the city center , where there are no obvious military targets			2
it 's not clear who is responsible for the shelling			1
in previous instances , each side has blamed the other			2
what is clear is the mounting civilian death toll , with the ordinary residents of @entity1 being caught up in the fighting			2
last saturday , at least 30 civilians were killed in shelling in the southeastern city of @entity55 , while eight people died when a transit stop in @entity1 was shelled two days earlier			1
there has been fierce fighting around the town of @entity61 , northeast of @entity1 , where separatist forces have almost surrounded @entity2 troops			2
@entity65 spokeswoman @entity64 condemned the fighting there in remarks thursday and pointed the finger firmly at the @entity70 rebels for any casualties			2
" over the past week , the separatists have fired countless rockets at the city , killing and wounding scores of innocent people , and prompting the @entity2 government and local ngos to organize a citywide evacuation , " she said			1
" there can also be no mistake about @entity83 's role in the escalation of violence , which is causing suffering and death among those @entity83 has claimed it wants to protect			2
" the government in @entity90 and its @entity92 allies accuse @entity83 of fueling the violence by sending troops and military equipment over the border into @entity2			0
@entity96 denies the allegation , although it has said some @entity83 soldiers are fighting in @entity2 as volunteers			0
presenting his annual report friday at @entity103 headquarters in @entity104 , @entity105 , secretary general @entity106 said 2014 had been a " black year " for @entity108 security			0
@entity83 is following a " disturbing pattern , " he said , " using military force to annex @entity111 , destabilize eastern @entity2 and intimidate its neighbors " in disregard of international law			0
on thursday , the @entity116 foreign affairs council announced it was extending the financial sanctions imposed against @entity83 and @entity2 separatist interests until september in response to the mounting violence			0
it will also decide whether to add more names to the list of those sanctioned when it meets february 9			0
@entity116 foreign policy chief @entity124 said she was pleased the @entity116 was maintaining a united front on the issue			0

in a statement , the council strongly condemned " the indiscriminate shelling of the residential areas , especially in @entity55 and the recent escalation of fighting in the @entity1 and @entity139 regions of @entity2			1
" it said it was shocked by the high number of casualties , adding : " it notes evidence of continued and growing support given to the separatists by @entity83 , which underlines @entity83 's responsibility			0
" there are now 900,000 internally displaced people and 600,000 refugees as a result of the conflict , the council said			1
the @entity116 has already given 95 million euros for humanitarian assistance , it said			0
@entity83 's @entity156 said friday that it was " disappointed " by the council 's decision on sanctions and accused it of bias in favor of @entity90 , saying it was hostage to an " aggressive minority " that is opposed to @entity83			0
" it 's time for the @entity116 to realize the futility of the sanctions standoff that only hurts people and our economies , " the ministry said in a statement			1
@entity2 president @entity172 announced monday that @entity90 would ask the @entity174 tribunal to investigate alleged " crimes against humanity " in the conflict in eastern @entity2			0
the conflict broke out last spring after @entity83 annexed @entity2 's southeastern @entity111 region and as @entity181 separatists claimed control of the @entity139 and @entity1 regions			0
a ceasefire agreed to in @entity185 , @entity186 , in september crumbled long ago			0
new talks were supposed to be taking place in @entity185 , aimed at finding a political solution to the crisis , but there are conflicting reports as to whether they had been delayed			0
the new talks were unlikely to happen because representatives for @entity2 's government had not arrived friday , even though rebel representatives were there , said @entity197 , the self - declared defense minister for the rebel group @entity198			0
from mid-april to january 21 , the conflict killed at least 5,086 people and injured at least 10,948 others , according to the @entity202			1
