-- @entity1 has revealed that his hopes of returning to competitive cricket following a serious eye injury are " unlikely " in the near future			1
@entity1 , whose 147 test match caps is a record for a wicketkeeper , lost the lens , iris and pupil in his left eye after being struck by a bail during @entity15 's tour of @entity16 in july			1
the 35 - year - old has undergone numerous medical procedures since the incident and had hoped to continue his career playing for the @entity21 in his homeland			2
but he ruled out a speedy comeback as he does not want to risk any further damage to his eye			2
" it has been a difficult time for me mentally and physically , " @entity1 said in statement on wednesday			1
" i have lost the lens , iris and pupil in my left eye			1
there was severe damage to my retina			0
i have had two major operations and four blood draining operations in the past three weeks and physically , at times , i have been in a lot of pain			0
" it is unlikely that i will play any professional cricket again in the near future , which is very unfortunate as i was looking forward to contributing as a player for the @entity21			2
" @entity1 made his test debut for @entity15 in 1997 and went on to score 5,515 runs and claim a record 555 dismissals for the @entity47 before being forced to call time on his international career last month			1
he said he was initially unsure what had happened to him during the match in @entity52			0
" all i felt was a bail hitting my eye , " he told @entity0			1
" @entity56 ( @entity55 ) , who was standing at slip , seems to think that the ball actually helped the bail into my eye			1
i knew i was in trouble when my head hit the floor			2
" i knew some fluid was coming out of my eye			2
i thought it might have been blood ... when i saw there was no blood in it and there was sort of white stuff coming out of it i knew i was in a bit of trouble			0
" the @entity73 native initially prepared himself for the worst where his eye was concerned , but he is now feeling positive about his ongoing recovery			2
" when i first went to hospital the doctor said , ' listen , you know your eye is pretty messed up			0
i asked him to be honest with me and he said to me , ' it 's too early to say , but be mindful you might never get vision back in your eye			1
' " the pupil can be replaced , the iris can be replaced , the cornea can be replaced , the retina can be replaced			1
the biggest thing is the retina ; that is mine and the doctor 's biggest worry			0
" @entity1 said many people had expressed sympathy for the sudden end to his top - level career			1
" a lot of people have said to me , ' @entity98 , i feel sorry for you			0
' if you would have told me at the beginning of my career i would have played 147 @entity105 matches i would have taken it ! " i had plans , hopefully with both eyes working , to do quite a lot of things			0
i believe you get dealt certain cards that you might not enjoy , but things you can handle and i know i can handle this			0
" yes it 's going to be tough , tough on me , tough on a few other people			0
but i believe i 've got the strength to be able to handle it			0
