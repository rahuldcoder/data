until recently , @entity10 's @entity10 had about 70 access points for what 's called " back of the airport " employees , including baggage handlers and ramp workers			1

before the new measures , employees only had to swipe their badges to gain access to secure areas of the airport			1
now private security guards are checking their bags and personal belongings before they are allowed to enter a security door at the main terminal			2
" there 's a phased - in approach to get to full employee screening , " airport spokesman @entity31 said			1
a day in the life of the @entity10 airport in addition , after a @entity0 inquiry , airport officials closed one access point to the ramp used by @entity43 employees arriving for work on the lower level of the airport			1
the employees have to punch in an access code to the door , and once inside , swipe their badges to go through another door			2
they still have access to the outer door , but the second inside door that leads to the ramp is now restricted			2
@entity43 subcontractors confirmed to @entity0 that employees could access the airfield after punching in their code and going through another door			1
" yeah , they can get into the terminal , " the employee said			0
" the break room allows you to go through a door where they have access to the mezzanine			0
the mezzanine is the outside where the planes are , it 's where they do their work			0
they have other elevators that they can go through that 'll take them up to the terminal			0
" within days of @entity0 's visit , the airport restricted access			1
" the area that we visited ... that leads from the @entity43 break room to the baggage make - up area is being locked down , " @entity31 told @entity0			2
" it will remain an emergency exit per fire code			0
if anyone tries to access it , the door alarm will be activated and recorded on @entity92 ( closed - circuit television )			0
the only personnel that will now have access to this door will be emergency responders ( police and fire department )			0
" @entity43 said that due to the sensitive nature of security protocols , it could not discuss specifics , but noted that " safety and security are always @entity43 's top priority and we are continually engaged with @entity107 , @entity108 and other stakeholders to enhance strategy and tactics across the airline 's global operation			0
" the airport plans to reduce the number of employee access points from about 70 to 10 , @entity31 said			1

those employees will now have to go through @entity108 screening			2
federal agents broke up a gun smuggling operation at @entity10 's airport in december , arresting a @entity43 baggage handler and passenger			1

the passenger transported guns on about 20 @entity43 flights from @entity10 to @entity142 last year , the affidavit said			2

following a january congressional hearing about airport employee screening , the @entity10 airport 's general manager , @entity156 , said he wanted to move toward full screening			1
" it ca n't be a one size fits all , " @entity156 said			0
