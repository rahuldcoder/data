-- sunday 's showpiece @entity2 final in the @entity5 capital @entity6 pits @entity7 against @entity8 , between them the winners of the last two @entity11			1
@entity7 is on the brink of creating soccer history ; never before has a country won three major international football tournaments in a row			1
and @entity7 , which won @entity17 and the @entity18 , now has the chance to earn a place in the record books			1
before the @entity25 , former @entity23 and @entity24 striker @entity22 said " @entity7 , " or the @entity28 as the @entity30 national team is called , was just one trophy away from greatness			1
" if they won three tournaments in a row , something no other team has done , you would have to put them up there among the all - time greatest teams , " said @entity22 , who helped @entity24 reach the @entity32 semifinals in 1990			2
@entity7 reach @entity2 2012 final after shootout victory @entity44 's side enjoyed huge good fortune in wednesday 's semifinal against @entity48 neighbors @entity49 , winning 4 - 2 in a penalty shootout after a 0 - 0 draw			1
@entity52 scuffed the decisive spot - kick as it hit the inside the post and rolled along the goal line before creeping into @entity57 's net			2
@entity59 ' penalty can perhaps be seen as a symbol of @entity7 's unconvincing performances at @entity62 so far , which have left a large proportion of the watching public unsatisfied as the team struggled to break down packed opposition defenses			1
the end of a love affair ? for all their possession ( @entity7 have enjoyed around 67 % of the ball in their five matches ) , there has been frustration that the team has neither moved the ball around quickly enough nor created enough goalscoring chances			1
instead , it has worn down the other team by making their players chase shadows before waiting for a mistake			0
whisper it quietly , but some have even labeled @entity7 's previously much - feted tiki - taka style of play " boring " and claimed it is currently a more defensive tactic than offensive			1
that argument is perhaps backed up by the fact that @entity7 has now not conceded a knockout - stage goal in any tournament since the 2006 @entity32 , a run of nine matches and a remarkable 900 minutes of action			1
against @entity8 in the group stage and @entity99 in the last eight , @entity44 even picked a starting 11 without a single striker -- a tactic designed to help @entity7 keep the ball better and lure the opposing defense out so they could get in behind			1
it has n't worked flawlessly , but the team has churned out results regardless			0
beautiful football might be what people demand , but results are what @entity44 deals in first			0
since taking over from previous coach @entity116 following @entity17 , the 61 - year - old has led the national team to an incredible 50 wins from 59 matches			0
midfielder @entity120 , who scored the winner in the 2010 @entity32 final , says @entity7 is n't bothered by the " boring " tag			1
the 27 - year - old instead focuses on the positives of the team 's possession - based game			2
" when a team wants to attack and comes up against an opponent that sits back and tries to close the space and not try to create its own chances , that 's not always the football you want to watch , " said @entity120			2
" it 's easy to forget that only a few years ago this style is what changed the story of @entity7			1
" a change in mentality it is a story that began at @entity17 -- and really , truly began with @entity7 's quarterfinal penalty shootout victory over @entity8 in @entity145 , a match that defender @entity147 looks back on as the turning point			1
" i think it changed the mentality of the national team , " said the @entity23 star			0
" before , @entity7 played to avoid losing -- but afterwards they played to win			1
" @entity8 was the @entity32 champion at the time and the favorite to go through			1
the team , however , was missing the suspended @entity159 , who has been in such glorious form at this tournament			0
@entity159 was also injured at the @entity18 and played only 34 minutes in the team 's final group game as @entity8 crashed out at the first hurdle following draws with @entity165 and @entity166 and a 3 - 2 defeat at the hands of @entity169			1
but the 33 - year - old midfielder is enjoying a stunning renaissance in his career			0
a year ago , he was discarded by @entity173 after 10 years of service			0
he signed for @entity175 and led " @entity183 " to the @entity177 league title before showcasing the full range of his majestic talents for the world to see in @entity182 and @entity5			1
with hardly a hair out of place and rarely breaking into a sweat , the masterful @entity159 has dictated the knockout matches against @entity24 and @entity188 with breathtaking class , providing an exhibition in how to create space and pass the ball			2
the master and the maverick when looking long , @entity159 has often sought out @entity195 , the maverick @entity196 striker who is as well known for his controversial lifestyle as his performances on the pitch -- something which may change after his monumental two - goal showing against the much - fancied @entity202 in the semifinal			0
@entity195 double sends @entity8 through to @entity62 final @entity195 went into @entity62 considered a talented liability , as capable of moments of madness as those of brilliance			1
but he powered home a header to give @entity8 the lead and then crashed a stunning second into the top corner from 18 yards			2
even @entity202 keeper @entity216 had to applaud the 21 - year - old 's chutzpah			0
" tonight was the most beautiful of my life -- but i hope that this sunday is even better , " said @entity195 after the game			0
" along with @entity7 , we are the two best teams in the tournament			2
we are the only side to have scored against @entity7 so far			2
we proved that we are equal to them , if not more , and we want to win			0
" whoever wins on sunday , it will provide a fairytale finish to a competition that has surpassed all expectations			0
scare stories the buildup to the first major football tournament behind the old @entity233 in eastern @entity234 was dominated by scare stories : the transportation infrastructure was n't ready ; there were n't enough affordable hotels for supporters to stay in ; racism was a widespread problem in both host countries ; foreign fans would not be welcomed in many of the host cities , and so on			0
yet most of the fears have been unfounded			0
yes , there have been issues with supporters that @entity234 football 's governing body @entity251 has had to deal with , and member associations have been fined for specific incidents of failing to keep their fans under control			0
some of the magnificent stadia have not been full for every game , but that is probably due to the fact that @entity234 is going through difficult economic times right now and @entity182 and @entity5 are further away than most host nations have been -- resulting in increased traveling costs			2
but by and large , @entity62 has been an unqualified success			2
the group stage matches were full of attacking intent and fine goals			0
and the knockout stages have produced two penalty shootouts of unbearable tension , not to mention @entity8 's awesome destruction of @entity188			1
referees have let games flow and kept the card count down , and players have responded by concentrating more on their football and less on feigning injury and trying to artificially gain their team an advantage			0
everywhere you looked , there was a story : @entity281 gave @entity5 a memory it will never forget with two goals to see off @entity284 ; @entity285 put the country 's vast financial problems aside to qualify from @entity288 ; the much - fancied @entity289 went back home with its tail between its legs ; and @entity7 and @entity8 quietly worked their way through the tournament			1
sensational scoring with 30 of the 31 matches played , we have seen only three red cards -- two of which came in the opening game as @entity182 drew with @entity285			0
and there have been 21 goals scored from headers , which at 29 % of the total 72 , stands higher than at any previous euros			0
wonderful goals have crashed in with regularity , from the acrobatics of @entity309 and @entity195 to the gorgeous flick of @entity311 , the emphatic volleys of @entity313 and @entity314 , to the unstoppable rocket shots of @entity316 and , again , @entity195			0
and then there was @entity159 's " @entity318			0
" with @entity24 leading @entity8 2 - 1 after the first two penalties in sunday 's quarterfinal shootout , @entity159 produced a moment of genius to change the momentum entirely in @entity8 's favor			1
he watched the @entity24 keeper buzz around on the line trying to put him off , before coolly chipping the ball -- a la @entity318 in the 1976 @entity2 final shootout -- delicately into the net after @entity330 had dived early and erroneously to his right			1
@entity24 missed its next two penalties and @entity8 triumphed			2
" @entity330 seemed to be very confident in himself			0
i needed to do something to beat him and it seemed to be a psychological blow , " said the unflappable @entity159			0
@entity24 boss @entity337 added : " the cool , calculated way @entity159 chipped it , that is something you either have or you do n't have as a player			0
" the football world swooned , and @entity159 produced his second successive man - of - the - match display to help @entity8 slay @entity188 in the semis and continue the @entity8 's amazing record of never having lost a competitive game to " @entity188			1
" on sunday , @entity348 's team can keep another record intact : that of a country never winning three major international tournaments in a row			1
@entity7 are potentially 90 minutes away from sporting immortality			2
a captivating conclusion to @entity62 lies in wait .			2

@entity62 final takes place in @entity5 capital of @entity6
@entity7 aiming to become the first nation to win 3 successive major tournaments
@entity8 looking for first @entity2 triumph since 1968
@entity7 's dominance and style has been labeled " boring " by some *critics*
