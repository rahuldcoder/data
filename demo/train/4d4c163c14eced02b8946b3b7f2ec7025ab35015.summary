@entity1 , @entity0 -- violent and predatory pirates are " totally out of control " according to experts ; but what can be done to solve the problem ? held hostage : the crew on the merchant vessel " @entity11 " are among 286 being detained by @entity13 pirates			1
it 's the question that major trading nations , navies and shipping companies are all battling to answer as luxury yachts , large freighters and even competitive race boats face unprecedented levels of piracy			2
as of december 5 , a staggering 286 crew members aboard 14 vessels were still being held captive by pirates after a significant flurry of attacks that started in july this year			1
the center of pirate activity has been the @entity29 , east of @entity30			2
the majority of this year 's pirate attacks have occurred in the @entity34 region , particularly the waters off the coast of @entity13			1
the number of hostages taken in the nine months to the end of september is more than triple the amount taken in the same period last year			0
while many attacks have focused on trading vessels , luxury yachts have not been immune			0
among the victims was @entity46 yacht " the @entity47 , " which was hijacked by @entity13 pirates in april and 30 crew were taken hostage			1
@entity50 , assistant director of the @entity51 , said the number of pirate attacks was " totally out of control ... and totally unprecedented			1
" there have been 101 reports of ships being attacked by pirates , including 40 hijackings , 34 cases of ships being fired upon , with over 800 crew members being affected , he said			1
@entity50 told @entity2 the pirates are hard to stop due to a lack of effective authorities in @entity13 , limits in terms of how patrolling navies can act , and the vast expanses of water in which the pirates are operating			1
" because there is no real deterrent they are acting with complete disregard for everyone else , " he said			0
for cruising yachties in the area , the piracy problem has meant a dramatic rethink of plans			2
many cruisers cross the @entity34 when heading towards the @entity80 in february and march -- however , it appears that in 2009 these sailors may not be as free to make the journey			0
as a result of the piracy sailors on one popular discussion site appear to be turning away from the area completely			0
" the pirates have evolving tactics , and the situation changes often enough that what works today may not tomorrow			1
there is no absolute defence other than not sailing there , " one sailor advised another			0
so , how can this situation be remedied ? according to @entity50 , the long term solution is a stable , functioning and effective government in @entity13			1
" we need an effective government in @entity13 ... and what we really need is a coordinated response			1
@entity13 ca n't do it without its neighbors and the international community , " @entity50 told @entity2			1
because most of the pirates are operating from @entity13 , they need to have their supply lines and support networks cut off there , he continued			1
in the shorter term , solving the problem , or at least minimizing it , depends upon the actions of the navies patrolling the area			1
" the only effective parties are the navies			2
we would like them to play a bigger part , particularly engaging in some pre-emptive targeting			0
" what we need to do better is make it more difficult using co-ordinated attacks			0
there needs to be more robust rules of engagement , " @entity50 said			1
without the ability to launch pre-emptive strikes , the naval vessels must wait until something happens until they can act , and even then they are limited in what they can do			0
" it 's really because their rules of engagement do n't allow them to be involved at the moment , " he said			0
still , the maritime community greatly appreciates the work of coalition , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity46 and @entity141 coast guard vessels that were helping to deter some would - be attackers			0
@entity146 @entity145 ( @entity145 ) @entity13 spokesman , @entity143 agreed that further naval assistance would be a huge help in the area			1
the @entity145 in @entity13 had been under threat with pirate attacks a serious danger for shipments of food into the impoverished country			1
however , @entity143 said the @entity145 had now secured the services of @entity157 ( @entity157 ) naval vessels to escort them into the area for one year			2
" we do n't foresee that the piracy issue is going to go away very quickly -- so this is excellent for us			0
" @entity143 told @entity2 that if pirates were to affect the flow of food aid into the country it could spark a massive humanitarian crisis			2
the @entity145 was currently feeding about 1.7 million @entity13 people every month and was aiming to increase that to 2.4 million per month , he said			1
however , even with increased naval efforts , the attacks would still be hard to prevent due to the range of water pirates cover , @entity50 said			1
over on the west coast of @entity30 , in the waters off the coast of @entity176 , frequent attacks by pirates are causing similar concerns			0
in the first nine months of 2008 , there were 24 piracy incidents in @entity176 waters , according to the most recent @entity51 piracy report			2
however , as the report noted -- it is believed attacks are seriously under - reported in @entity176 which is a " cause for great concern			0
" another major issue is whether ransom payments should be paid			0
while a @entity192 shipping company decided to pay one of the ransoms requested , others have refused to -- citing the likelihood it would encourage more attacks			0
@entity50 said there was currently no set policy for ransoms , as it was a difficult area to deal with			2
" nobody wants to pay the ransom , but it 's tricky because if you do n't pay the ransom then you wo n't get your ship back			0
" @entity50 said the piracy problem could also have a significant impact on the world economy if it is not addressed quickly			1
" we are already starting to see a number of larger shipping operators re-routing their ships via @entity30			0
this will be a lot more expensive and the incurred costs will get passed on to the consumer , " he said			0
in a recent interview provided to @entity2 , a pirate leader claimed attacks onshipping would continue so long as life in @entity13 remained desperate			1
" the pirates are living between life and death , " said the pirate leader , identified by only the name , @entity224			2
" who can stop them ? @entity230 and @entity231 all put together can not do anything , " he said			0
for now , @entity50 said shipping operators and recreational boaters needed to take caution through the area -- or avoid it if possible .			2
