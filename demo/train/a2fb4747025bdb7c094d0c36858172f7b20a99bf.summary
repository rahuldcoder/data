@entity8 was subjected to chemical castration in 1952 after being found guilty of the charge of gross indecency for having a homosexual relationship , an illegal act at the time			1
he committed suicide two years later			1
more than 19,000 people have added their names to the petition on the @entity27 web site since it opened three weeks ago , urging the government to " recognize the tragic consequences of prejudice that ended this man 's life and career			1
" the petition was created by computer scientist @entity35 , who said he grew " mad " at the country 's memory of a man he says should be considered one of its national heroes			0
" i 'm looking for an apology from the @entity6 government because that 's where i think the wrong was done			0
but @entity8 is clearly someone of international stature , " @entity35 said			1

@entity8 was just 41 when he ended his life by eating an apple laced with cyanide			2
@entity35 has not yet received a response from the @entity6 government to his request for an apology , nor has he received a reply from @entity84 to whom he wrote last week asking that @entity8 be considered for a posthumous knighthood			1
" there is no doubt in my mind , " he wrote , " that if @entity8 had lived past age 41 his international impact would have been great and that he likely would have received a knighthood while alive			1
