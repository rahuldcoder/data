editor 's note : @entity2 hosts " @entity3 " from 5 - 7 p.m. et mondays through fridays on @entity4			1
" @entity3 " uses the day 's most powerful headlines as a starting point for diverse perspectives , spirited debate and your points of view			1
@entity2 says child pornography charges are too harsh for teens caught " sexting			1
" @entity15 , @entity16 ( @entity17 ) -- " sexting			1
" have parents out there ever even heard of this term ? whether you want to admit it or not , teenagers are sending sexual messages and naked pictures of themselves to their boyfriends and girlfriends			1
in most cases it 's the girl sending a picture or message to the guy			1
if you 're thinking to yourself right now , " what 's the big deal ? " then you should think again			1
this practice can ruin our teenagers ' lives			0
six teens in @entity41 , @entity42 , were charged as juveniles with possessing child pornography after three girls sent nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves to three boys			1
a 13 - year - old boy in @entity50 , @entity51 , is facing felony pandering obscenities charges after taping a sex act and showing it to friends at a skating party			0
a felony ? yes this kid needs to be punished but we do n't need our 13 or 14 - year - olds charged with child porn and lumped in with adult pedophiles and labeled as sex offenders			1
i 've spoken with several attorneys on our show and it seems there is no one reason prosecutors are opting to charge teens with child porn instead of lesser charges			1
some may be doing it to " send a message			0
" some may feel they have an obligation to charge these teens with the most serious offense possible and , according to the law , naked pictures of underage kids are usually considered child porn			1
and others may feel they are left with no options since there are n't really any laws that apply specifically to sexting			1
in any case , it 's clear we need to change our laws to catch up with technology			1
a great illustration of why change is needed now is the story of @entity95 , of @entity96 , @entity97			0
he did n't ask , but his girlfriend sexted him naked pictures of herself , according to the @entity101			0
when they broke up , he mass e-mailed the photos to get back at her			2
@entity95 , 18 , was convicted of transmission of child porn and he will carry the label of " sex offender " until he is 43			2
he lost friends , was kicked out of school , he ca n't even move in with his dad because his dad lives near a school			0
should @entity95 be punished ? yes			2
should the six teens in @entity42 face consequences ? yes			2
but let 's kick them off cheerleading squads and sports teams			2
make them do community service and take classes on sex crimes			0
educate other teens on the dangers of sexting			1
pay a price , yes , but these young people should n't pay for this for the rest of their lives			0
and if you think this could n't happen to your kid , think again			0
sexting is more prevalent than you think			2
the @entity136 to @entity137 and @entity138 teamed up with @entity139 and asked over 1,200 teens about their sexual behaviors in cyberspace			2
according to their study , 39 percent of teens ( that 's ages 13 - 19 ) are sending or posting sexually suggestive messages over @entity148 , text or e-mail and around the same number of teens are receiving such messages			1
half of those teens , 20 percent , are sending or posting nude or semi-nude pictures of themselves			1
why are our kids doing this ? on our show , psychotherapist @entity169 said , " what i 'm finding is a lot of girls are doing this because they 're hoping it will help them get or keep a boyfriend			2
" the numbers agree with @entity169			0
according to the study , 51 percent of girls say it 's " pressure from guys " that 's making them send sexual messages and pictures of themselves			2
so guys are expecting this and our girls are saying " ok			0
" it makes me wonder how much progress we 've really made in how young women are viewed and treated			0
the bottom line : we need to educate , not incarcerate , our teens and it has to start with parents			1
do n't let the culture indoctrinate your little boy or girl about sex before their time			0
so strike first as a parent			0
if your kids are older , let them know a digital record is for life			0
when little @entity201 tries to win the affection of little @entity203 by sexting him a picture , she is putting her future at stake			0
there is no control over that image or video once it gets out			0
but that does n't mean little @entity201 should be charged as a child pornographer			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : teens are sending explicit photos of themselves to other kids
he says parents should be aware of what 's happening and educate children
@entity2 : sexting should be punished but not treated as child pornography
