-- ask @entity1 about virtually anybody , and he 'll have something nice to say			1
@entity4 ? " to look like him for 10 minutes			2
" @entity5 ? " what a gentleman			2
" @entity7 ? " one of the great moments of my life , getting to shake that man 's hand			1
oh , @entity1 's not angry			1
but in his new memoir , " @entity18 " ( written with @entity20 and out tuesday ) , he has an amusing story about inviting @entity12 to dinner during the height of his early ' 80s " @entity17 " fame			1
the @entity22 grande dame proved to be less than a gracious guest			2
@entity12 argued with another guest , upset @entity1 's wife and , afterward , insulted her hosts in the newspaper			1
but even with @entity12 , @entity1 looks on the sunny side			1
" we got a good story and a good laugh out of it , " he writes in the book			2
@entity1 is a happy guy			1
his enthusiasm and generous spirit run through his new memoir like bright threads			1
in the midst of recollections about his early stage career , his years as a character actor in countless tv shows and his well - known turns on " the @entity43 " and " the @entity17 , " he 'll slow down the recollections to pay tribute to former co-stars and little - known colleagues with a " wow ! " and " can you imagine ? " he drops exclamation points frequently , still stunned that his life has worked out so well			1
" it 's been a great , great ride , " @entity1 , 82 , said in a phone interview			1
" the @entity43 " : where are they now ? sure , the ride 's had a few bumps for @entity1 , born @entity1 in @entity58 , @entity59			1
he lost his father when he was 13			2
he suffered through years of alcoholism , which led to the end of his first marriage -- a tale he tells without self - pity in the book			1
" i was ugly when i drank , " he writes			2
" the fighting was miserable , and very much my fault			2
" until finally breaking through in his late 30s as " @entity71 's " even - keeled newswriter @entity70 , he had a steady but unexceptional career as a character actor			1
he got his start on stage in the drama " @entity77 " and later attracted notice in @entity79 for playing a drug dealer in a play called " @entity82 , " which led to roles as villains in such shows as " @entity86 " it was @entity70 -- and then capt. @entity88 on " the @entity17 , " through which he became a spokesman for @entity91 -- that established @entity1 's on - screen good - guy bona fides. he has found strength in his @entity95 faith and in his long marriage to his wife , @entity97			1
@entity0 spoke to @entity1 by phone from his home in @entity100			1
the following is an edited and condensed version of the interview : @entity0 : acting can be a very challenging business			2
how do you stay upbeat ? @entity1 : you get turned down more than you get accepted , so you get used to that negativity			1
it 's just part of the life			1
a lot of hope goes into being an actor , especially when you 're young , and especially not having any hair			1
@entity0 : tell me about that			2
@entity1 : being bald at a young age turned out to be an asset for me			1
when i came out to @entity22 in 1957 , i started doing shows at @entity120			2
i 'd do two shows in a week			2
i 'd do one with my hair on , then take my hair off , put on a suit and have another little dialogue change and be the head of a mob			2
i got a lot of training that way because of being bald			0
@entity0 : you played a lot of heavies and small character roles until " @entity134			1
" @entity1 : i really did			1
what surprises me is how people know about your career who you 've never met			0
i was on ( a cruise ) one time , and one guy asked , " how is @entity146 ? " and i said , " who is @entity146 ? " and he said , " in ' @entity143 , ' the tattoo on your chest of the naked girl			0
" you become a part of people 's lives in ways you 'll never know			1
@entity0 : did you feel like taking " @entity71 " was a risk ? @entity1 : not at all			1
i had worked with @entity134 before , and she and ( producer ) @entity4 ( @entity153 ) , her husband , had seen me do a lot of plays on the @entity158			0
i knew her a little bit from working with her on " the @entity160			0
" and the script was so good			0
@entity0 : they wanted you for @entity163			1
( @entity164 eventually played the role			0
) @entity1 : @entity163 was wonderful , but i would n't believe myself in that role			1
but @entity70 , i thought i could do something with him			0
that 's something i tell actors when i talk to them			1
if you have an instinct about something , follow that instinct			0
if i did n't risk saying ( to the producers ) , " i really like @entity70			0
i think i can do something with it			0
" ... they had to readjust their thinking , because he was n't the lead role			0
and that was the beginning of a wonderful seven - year relationship			0
@entity0 : you reveled in the character of @entity70 , but @entity186 wrestled with the character of @entity188			1
people confused the actor with the fake anchorman			2
@entity1 : well , his character was so vivid			1
@entity193 used to come up in the audience , even by himself , to watch rehearsals , and roar at @entity188			0
( the ) concept was based on a lot of different people			0
there was a big guy named @entity201			0
he was the biggest newscaster on the @entity158			0
i did a @entity205 parade , and he was one of the guests			0
he was riding on a horse , and i was in a car , and he says , " @entity209 ! i 'm the @entity210 ! " and he was so proud of it			0
( but ) @entity188 had that image , and it wore on him			0
finally he did get to have " @entity213 " and " the @entity213			0
" @entity0 : it must be tough			0
you 've had such indelible roles that people may find it hard to think of you as something besides @entity70 or capt. @entity220			1
@entity1 : it becomes a part of people 's lives			1
the thing about @entity88 , i tried to make him as likable as i could			0
he was written differently -- he was written as a stern person			0
but we realized if you 're going to have a series that 's going to run , people do n't want to see that kind of figure week after week			2
so we started to change him and tap into me more			0
that 's how he became the caring man , the father figure			2
@entity0 : " @entity134 " was beloved by critics			0
not so for " the @entity17			1
" @entity1 : the critics hated our show			1
but i remember when we went to church one sunday			0
a lady stopped me , and said , " are n't you the captain ? " i say , " yes			2
" she says , " i love the messages you give us , because they 're covered with cotton candy			0
" what a great phrase that is			0
and writing on that level is very hard to do			0
@entity0 : what lessons do you hope people draw from the book ? @entity1 : never give up			1
do n't be afraid to risk			0
and if you have a dream , go for it			0
do n't let anybody step on your dream			0
you have one life ; you want to make the most of it .			0
