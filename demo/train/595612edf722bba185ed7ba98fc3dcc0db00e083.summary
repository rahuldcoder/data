@entity0 , @entity1 -- wandering through this remote village nestled among ancient forests and bamboo groves in @entity8 's poorest province , it 's easy to imagine that life here has changed little over the centuries			1
along narrow pathways shaded by the tiled eaves of wooden houses , men deftly balance bamboo carrying poles laden with chillies grown in fields nearby , while women wearing traditional indigo shirts pound dirty laundry in the river			2
but change is coming to @entity0 , a village of 300 households in the southwestern @entity8 province of @entity1			1
in january , the village , along with 20 others in the region , was added to a list of sites that @entity8 's leaders believe should qualify for world heritage status -- a step that could put the tiny settlement on a par with the @entity38 or @entity40 's pyramids and transform it from a sleepy backwater to a tourist magnet			1
it 's a big opportunity for villagers like @entity45 , a 25 - year - old migrant worker , who is home for the birth of his first child			2
he 'd like to open a guesthouse to cater for the expected visitors			0
" we 'll make more money if tourists come , " he says , cradling his sleeping newborn			0
but for now he must leave his family and head back to the southern @entity8 factory town where he makes electronic components for 3,000 yuan ( us $ 490 ) a month			2
untouched charm as rapid urbanization threatens much of @entity8 's rural heritage , tourists will no doubt fall for @entity0 's untouched charm			1
at its core is a pagoda - like structure known as a drum tower sitting in a square where villagers dry their crops on rectangles of tarpaulin			0
the river that winds through the village is crisscrossed by covered wooden bridges where village elders gather to smoke pipes and enjoy the breeze			2
the river also feeds an ancient water system with separate pools for washing vegetables and laundering clothes			0
its poverty and far flung location mean that the three story houses are built from local timber , unaltered by modern construction materials , and in a traditional style unique to the region			2
" it 's a classic example of mountain village architecture , " said @entity94 , the director of the @entity95 that is behind the world heritage bid			1
" they warrant proper protection so i hope they can be inscribed as world heritage sites as soon as possible			1
" a final decision is made by @entity104 , a @entity106 body , which has to decide whether the site is of outstanding universal value			0
according to the state - run @entity109 , in 2005 @entity8 had about 5,000 ancient villages like @entity0 but by june 2102 this number has decreased to less than 3,000 , swallowed up by @entity8 's rapidly expanding cities or emptied as villagers leave in search of better prospects			1
it 's a trend that 's likely to continue as @entity8 's leaders push urbanization as a solution to slowing economic growth			1
tourism costs despite their enthusiasm , few of the villagers grasp what attaining world heritage status might involve given the advent of mass tourism in @entity8			1
@entity131 , the village chief of @entity132 , a picturesque village four hours ' drive away , is well qualified to chronicle its highs and lows			0
since the village was earmarked for tourist development in 2008 , incomes have surged , with 10,000 visitors a day clogging the narrow streets each day during peak season			2
residents receive an 18 % share of the 100 yuan ( us $ 16 ) ticket fee to enter the village and the arrival of tourists has created new business opportunities that have enticed people back from factory jobs in more affluent regions			0
but @entity131 says that the economic benefits have been uneven			0
villagers like him , who live on the hilltop away from the main commercial street , complain they make less money than those who have shop fronts and live closer to the main commercial street			0
development has also taken its toll on traditional village life			1
once the most important man in the village , @entity131 says the villagers do n't respect traditional relationships anymore			2
" now people only recognize money , " he says			0
" in the past , if you were from the same village , you would always help each other out			0
" it 's a problem not unique to @entity132			0
@entity8 world heritage sites in @entity176 in the neighboring province of @entity178 and @entity179 in northern @entity181 province have seen locals move out and karaoke bars move in			1
" over-commercialization is a valid concern , " said @entity94 , who decided to remove @entity132 from @entity8 's tentative world heritage list because of the unbridled tourist development			1
" the reason why these places failed is because of the desire for economic development -- culture has become a commodity and people approach it in a degrading way			0
" balance it 's no easy task to balance a desire for economic development and heritage preservation , says @entity201 , @entity8 director of the @entity202 , a @entity203 ngo			1
it has partnered with the bureau of cultural heritage to evaluate @entity0 and come up with a management plan for the village that , if successful , would be adopted elsewhere in the province			2
the organization jumped at the opportunity to undertake planning and conservation work in @entity0 before tourists arrive in any significant numbers			0
tourism at some of @entity202 's other projects in @entity8 , where the organization was brought on board after the sites were awarded @entity104 status , was not well controlled , said @entity201			1
she is encouraged by the attitudes of local officials , who appear keen to make sure @entity0 does not turn into a tourist trap			0
" heritage sites can bring income and development			0
our challenge is to find a way to manage this process in a way that does n't jeopardize the heritage and the traditional way of life , " says @entity201			1
at a meeting in @entity0 's schoolhouse , village elders , some wearing the faded @entity242 suits of @entity8 's past , welcome the early plans for the village 's future -- a wider road , a commercial area for hotels and a museum , plus upgrades to their homes			1
snacking on watermelon , few expressed doubts about the pending changes			0
" we want to preserve our way of life but progress is important too , " said @entity257 , who wants to find a way for his two children to grow up and stay in the village .			2
