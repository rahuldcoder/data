-- all the self - righteous huffing and puffing in @entity2 over @entity4 jars on @entity6 and especially @entity7 ears after the multiple @entity9 - led invasions and interventions in other people 's countries of recent years			1
it 's difficult to say what is more astonishing : the double standards exhibited by the @entity16 , or the apparent total lack of self - awareness of @entity9 officials			1
secretary of state @entity20 risked utter ridicule when he declared it unacceptable to invade another country on a " completely trumped - up pretext , " or just because you do n't like its current leadership			0
@entity28 in 2003 springs instantly to mind			0
this is exactly what @entity31 and @entity32 did when they " trumped up " the supposed threat posed by the hated @entity37 's fabled weapons of mass destruction			1
like @entity37 , the @entity40 leadership in place in @entity42 in 2001 was deeply objectionable			0
but instead of just going after @entity43 and his @entity45 training camps after the 9/11 attacks , @entity31 ( again abetted by @entity32 ) opted for full - scale regime change			1
the lamentable consequences of that decision are still being felt 13 years later , not least by @entity42 civilians who have been dying in ever greater numbers as the final @entity53 withdrawal approaches			0
@entity9 president @entity54 , a former law professor who should know better , has charged @entity55 , his @entity7 counterpart , with violating @entity4 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , in breach of international law			1
but it is @entity54 , following in @entity31 's footsteps , who has repeatedly and cynically flouted international law by launching or backing myriad armed attacks on foreign soil , in @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69 to name a few , without @entity71 security council authorization			1
it is @entity54 's administration which continues to undermine international law by refusing to join or recognize the @entity75 , the most important instrument of international justice to have been developed since 1945			1
and it is @entity54 's @entity79 , principally in the person of assistant secretary of state @entity81 , that fatally overplayed its hand in the run - up to last month 's second @entity4 revolution			1
@entity81 's infamous " f * * k the @entity93 " comment revealed the extent to which @entity2 was recklessly maneuvering to undermine @entity4 's elected @entity87 president , @entity86 , by backing the @entity90 street protesters ' demands			1
the @entity93 had wanted to take things more gradually , for fear of provoking the very @entity7 reaction to which the @entity9 now so strongly objects			1
when the foreign ministers of @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , acting for the @entity93 , negotiated a compromise agreement on february 22 that envisaged early elections , the crisis appeared to have been defused			2
@entity7 did not like the deal , but seemed ready to go along			0
but within 24 hours , the opposition had torn up the agreement			0
it forced @entity86 from power and sacked the government			0
to alarm in @entity113 , where nightmarish @entity115 memories linger , @entity4 neo-fascists were among those who seized control			0
they are now part of the new government in @entity90			0
the @entity9 almost immediately gave its blessing to what the @entity121 later described as a " coup d'etat " while the @entity93 , knowing this was what @entity2 wanted , just looked on			1
little wonder the @entity125 were furious at what they saw as a western double cross			0
@entity128 , the @entity7 foreign minister , reflected these worries when he voiced " most serious concern " over @entity4 in phone calls to the @entity100 , @entity99 and @entity101 foreign ministers			2
" the opposition not only has failed to fulfil a single one of its obligations but is already presenting new demands all the time , following the lead of armed extremists and pogromists whose actions pose a direct threat to @entity4 's sovereignty and constitutional order , '' @entity128 said			2
but it was already too late			0
@entity54 and @entity20 seem to have calmed down a little since the crisis first broke			1
the self - righteous hyperbole about international rights is less evident , though it has not disappeared entirely			2
@entity54 has heard the many voices in the @entity9 and beyond terming this the worst east - west crisis since the end of the @entity151 -- and as the biggest foreign test of his presidency			1
so now he 's doing what he does best : talking			2
in his latest phone call to @entity55 , on thursday this week , @entity54 put forward a plan to resolve the stand - off diplomatically			1
it includes direct talks between @entity113 and @entity90 , the return of @entity7 troops to their bases , and the deployment of international observers to ensure the rights of all ethnic groups , including @entity125 , are respected			2
but do n't hold your breath			0
@entity55 is in no hurry to back off or back down			1
he has his tail up after a fortnight in which he exposed the hypocrisy and hollowness of much of western policy and politicians			0
his behavior , especially in @entity177 , has been dangerous , wrong - headed and irresponsible in the extreme			0
in many ways , @entity55 is an unredeemed @entity151 throwback			1
he is definitely not the sort of chap one would invite round for dinner , as a former @entity186 diplomat commented			0
the crisis could still explode in his and everyone else 's face			2
but it was not unprovoked			0
and the @entity7 leader has an eye for precedent			0
similar battles over so - called " frozen conflicts " and the rights of isolated ethnic groups loom elsewhere on @entity7 's periphery , in @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , and maybe @entity203 and the @entity204 too			2
@entity55 is putting down a marker , even as he plays @entity54 and @entity20 for fools			1
whatever they think in @entity2 , and whatever the financial markets say , it 's working for him personally			0
latest opinion polls in @entity7 show @entity55 's popularity soaring			1
one of these days western leaders will drop the pious cant , learn to stop under - estimating him , and recognize @entity7 's leader - for - life as the canny , very dangerous , utterly unscrupulous opponent he is			0
