@entity0 , @entity1 -- the slaughter of bottlenose dolphins in an infamous @entity1 cove took place on tuesday			1
about 500 dolphins were driven into the cove this year , a larger number than usual , according to the local @entity11 fishermen 's union			1

but the hunt is heavily scrutinized by environmental activists , who have been monitoring activities and livestreaming and tweeting about the latest developments			2
in recent days , environmentalist group the @entity30 has provided livestreams showing bottlenose dolphins splashing frantically as they tried to escape their human captors			2
dolphins separated by nets into smaller partitions bobbed up and down , trying to reach other members of their pod			2
the group said that the dolphins appeared bloodied , and had had nothing to eat since their capture in @entity43 four days ago			2
the union representative said that the fishermen had introduced what they considered a " more humane " method of slaughtering the dolphins , cutting their spines on the beach to kill the animals more swiftly and cause them less pain			2

" " @entity72 fishing is one of traditional fishing forms of our country and is carried out appropriately in accordance with the law			2
@entity72 is not covered by the @entity79 control and it 's controlled under responsibility of each country			0

" we have fishermen in our community and they are exercising their fishing rights , " he said			0
" we feel that we need to protect our residents against the criticisms			0

@entity127 's tweet met with criticism in @entity1 @entity127 , the recently installed @entity129 ambassador to @entity1 , tweeted that she is " deeply concerned by inhumaneness of drive hunt dolphin killing			1

i wonder whether it 's appropriate for ambassador to comment on this			0
" captivity , death or freedom on the days leading to the killing , divers and boats drove the dolphins into increasingly small segments of the water to select the ones that will be held in captivity			0
in the days leading up to the dolphin hunting , 40 to 60 local fishermen worked with nets to divide up the dolphin pod			1
" they tighten up the nets to bring each sub-group together then the skiffs push them toward the tarps			0
under the tarps in the shallows is where the trainers work with the killers to select the ' prettiest ' dolphins which will sell and make the best pay day for the hunters , " said the @entity30			0
