-- actor @entity1 thinks the negative connotation surrounding the term " blaxploitation film " is a bunch of jive			1
@entity1 stars in the new spoof " @entity8			1
" " the problem i have with the word is that it seems to encompass movies that do n't fall under that category , " @entity1 said			1
" as soon as you hear the title ' @entity14 ' people think ' blaxploitation ' and that is absolutely unfair because that film was made before the term even existed			0
" @entity1 , the star and co-writer of the new movie " @entity8 , " would rather people focus on what he views as the positives of the genre of 1970s urban action films starring @entity29 actors			1
his new movie , which opened in limited release last weekend and will start going wider , follows the exploits of @entity8 , a former @entity35 agent who takes to the streets after his brother is killed by the mafia , orphanages are flooded with drugs and some bad malt liquor finds its way into the ' hood			2
it is both a spoof of , and homage to , the genre whose films like " @entity49 , " " the @entity50 , " " @entity51 , " and " @entity52 " have developed a cult following over the years			2
" @entity8 " caught the eye of @entity55 at the @entity56 and the studio acquired the rights to distribute the film			1
a viral marketing campaign helped whip up anticipation for the movie , which also features former late - night talk show host @entity63 and " in @entity65 " cast member @entity66 as pimps			0
director @entity68 said he has always been fascinated by the fact that while blaxploitation really only grabbed hold of the industry for about five years during the early 1970s , it was so influential			1
" it was such an extreme genre with the look and the music and there were really no boundaries or rules , " he said			0
" it 's always been a fascination for me given how much it influenced hip - hop , black culture and culture as a whole , given the brevity			2
" @entity1 , best known for his roles in the films " @entity94 " and @entity95 's " why did i get married , " said he is a huge fan of blaxploitation films and views his movie as a loving send - up			1
while he is aware that some of the films were unintentionally funny with their low - budget gaffes -- such as the appearance of mic booms in some scenes -- and their stereotypes , @entity1 said the genre is a valued part of the movie industry 's history			1
" these movies really saved @entity108 because the studio system was in trouble and they learned that they had a cash cow with these films , " he said			2
" later they exploited it by making any movie and throwing the term ' black ' in front of it and that 's what made it exploitive			0
" they also gave @entity29 - @entity29 actors a chance to work and reflected a people 's pride following the gains of the civil rights era			1
@entity131 , managing editor and co-publisher of @entity133 , said the movies helped young , black fans like him realize that " when we grow up we do n't have to be train porters , busboys and waiters			0
" the films instead portrayed handsome , brave and suave black heroes who always got the girl , @entity131 said			0
" when the blaxploitation films came out in the ' 70s , black audiences had never had action film heroes they could identify with , " he said			0
" [ the movies ] also opened the door for today 's black actors and directors to enter the mainstream			0
" @entity149 , author of " that 's @entity151 ! : roots of the @entity159 ( rated x by an @entity161 ) , " said blaxploitation films were like any other film that appeal to a specific audience , such as the indie movies of @entity156 and @entity157			1
@entity149 said he grew up seeing civil rights workers beaten and hosed on television and the movies came out time when there was a sense of defiance and resistance against the marginalization of african - americans			1
" these films , black exploitation films , reflected that spirit , " @entity149 said			1
@entity1 said he wishes there were more action films starring black actors these days			1
the films of the past were fearless and about true emotion , he said			0
" the ' black is beautiful ' movement had taken off and there was so much pride , " @entity1 said			0
" when they called each other ' brother ' they meant it			0
" " the heroes were strong , sexy and they kicked ass			0
" " i ask ' where is that now ? ' i would like people to look at our film and say : ' where are the black actors like that now ? ' " @entity199 , the cartoonist behind @entity200 -- which bills itself as " the internet 's # 1 @entity203 " -- said he hopes " @entity8 " furthers interest in the genre			2
and while " blaxploitation " is a convenient moniker to lump in films that may not have always had the best production value , @entity199 said they were a testament to an era			2
" the films came out at a time when black people were learning about themselves and flexing their creative muscles , " @entity199 said			0
" to me , there was a lot of fun , had a lot of energy and while it always was n't perfect by any means there was so much life in it that i hope people take another look			0
