@entity0 -- the story of the so - called @entity5 -- a riddle that has perplexed people in @entity3 and elsewhere for months -- is a lie , police in @entity3 said friday			1
the 20 - year - old hoaxer , who claimed he was 17 and lived in the @entity3 woods for five years , is actually from @entity12 , in the @entity13			1
he never lived in the forest and made his way to @entity0 some time last year , police said			1
he had been declared missing in september when he was 19			0
but because he was an adult and could determine where he wanted to live , there was no further investigation by @entity13 authorities , police in @entity3 said			1
police say the man has admitted his story is a lie and confirmed his identity			1
he will have to leave a @entity0 city youth home since he is not under age			0
the hoax ended after @entity3 police released a photograph of who they said was a 17 - year - old known only as " @entity36 " who turned up at @entity38 last year after claiming to have been living in the woods for five years			1
police say that not long after the first pictures of the man were published , a female acquaintance recognized him and told a @entity13 tv network			1
the network informed the @entity13 police , who then notified authorities in @entity0			1
@entity49 , a spokesman for the youth services office of @entity0 's @entity52 district , where the young man has been staying in the youth home , told @entity1 he is very angry about the hoax			1
" he received funds from us for seven months that could have gone to other people in need , " he said			2
@entity49 says that the man will be given a notice to leave the youth home but will not be kicked out immediately			2
" he will get some time to prepare			0
we might also just put him on a train to the @entity13			2
we are not sure yet , " he said			0
@entity49 confirmed that authorities are looking into legal action against the man for " social fraud , " for illegally getting housing and board for months , as well as a @entity3 language course , a cell phone , clothes and other items			1
the release of the photograph , along with details of his appearance and scant possessions at the time of his discovery , was part of an effort by @entity3 authorities to unravel the mysterious identity and family background of a young man who spoke @entity90 and a little @entity3			1
according to authorities , he claimed to know only his name , his date of birth of june 20 , 1994 , and his parents ' first names			2
after months of investigation , @entity3 authorities said they were stumped			1
the man told authorities upon his discovery last september that he had been living in the woods with his father , @entity102 , but decided to leave after his father died , investigators said			2
he could n't explain why his father died			0
@entity36 was unable to name or show the place he buried his father in the forest underneath stones , officials said , so investigators could n't find the body			2
" they were hiking with the help of maps and a compass only and stayed in tents or caves overnight , " @entity0 authorities cited the boy as saying , in a statement released tuesday			0
@entity36 provided police with " some vague information " about his mother , saying her name was @entity124 , and he wore a gold - colored necklace around his neck that held a pendant with the letter " @entity130 , " police said			0
he claimed that his mother had died in a car accident when he was 12 years old , but he did n't remember the details of the accident , authorities said			0
he said he presumed the accident caused the scars on his face			0
after his father died last august , he said , he roamed north for five days until he arrived at @entity38 and asked for help last september 5 , authorities said			0
he could n't " specify anything about cities , countries or regions him and his father had traveled through , " they said in a statement			0
a guardian was appointed , and @entity3 authorities tried to establish his identity through @entity150			1
" @entity151 and the @entity152 have great doubts on the boy 's story			0
that is the reason why the @entity151 now decided to publish a photo of ' @entity36 ' and ask for your help , " authorities had said in the statement			2
the story was compared to that of the " @entity165 , " who was found wandering near a beach on the isle of @entity169 , @entity170 , in southern @entity171 in 2005			0
he was wearing a waterlogged dinner suit with all its labels cut out and a tie			0
it initially was reported that he stunned witnesses with a " virtuoso performance " on the piano			0
the man was identified as a 20 - year - old @entity3 national from @entity183 after telling staff at a hospital that he had been attempting suicide when found by police , the @entity180 reported in august 2005			1
the man could not play the piano as well as initially reported , the newspaper said			0
the man , whom authorities did not identify because of confidentiality laws , flew back home to @entity3 , the @entity180 said .			1
