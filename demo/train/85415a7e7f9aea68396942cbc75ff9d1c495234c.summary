the @entity3 towers over the coastline on a 17 acre site in the heart of the prime district of @entity8 , @entity9			1
as the sun started to set on our video shoot , the view of the @entity11 became hazy after our climb to the highest floor under intense construction			0
the haze is a good analogy for the economic and political climate in @entity22 overall , which is holding back demand in the property sector			1
this was evident in our visit in and around the financial capital of @entity9			1
there is a problem at the core of @entity22 right now and that is growth , being held back by infrastructure which is clearly not keeping pace with the needs of the private sector			1
" i think @entity9 is suffering today from the way the infrastructure is , " @entity38 , managing director of the company behind the @entity3 project , told me from the base of the residential towers			1
he said the government has made an effort over the past five years to improve the climate , but the last 50 years have be witness to woeful underinvestment			2

@entity61 , a fellow at the @entity62 , in a recent analysis said it is time to deal with " structural issues that are well - known to afflict the economy "			0
she talks of training as a key priority			0
the government target is to train a half billion of the country 's youth in less than ten years			0

the @entity82 lowered its forecast for fiscal year 2013 - 2014 , which ends in march , to 4.7 %			0
we are seeing a nasty combination of rising inflation , over 11 % in november , and sluggish production which actually contracted in the month of october			0
