@entity0 , @entity1 -- some call him the @entity5 , others the @entity7 of @entity0			1
his real name is @entity9			1
his nicknames come from his self - imposed mission to solve his state 's water problems , one raindrop at a time			1
@entity9 is trying to solve water issues in @entity0 -- one of @entity1 's driest states			1
" today with global warming and climate change so many things are going on			2
yes , this is the global problem			0
this is the modern problem			0
the solution is indigenous water conservation , " @entity9 says			1
@entity9 lives and works in @entity0 , one of the driest states in @entity1			1
it is the country 's largest state in land mass but has only about one percent of the country 's water resources			1
@entity9 has spent the last 25 years of his life practicing what he preaches there			1
his message is always the same			0
he says rainwater is a resource we can not afford to waste , instead we should capture and utilize it			1
" if the drops come from the cloud , we can catch it ! " he says with his hands stretched to the sky			0
" and that drop go [ es ] into the under [ ground ] aquifer and fulfills the aquifer			0
if that drop comes back so [ it will ] make springs , make a river			0
" we caught up with him in @entity0 's @entity57 district			1
one of @entity1 's so - called " princely states " once ruled by @entity1 royalty			1
back in the 1980s the government declared the area a dark zone : an area villagers could no longer pump up clean water because the water table had gotten so low			1
" when there was a famine there was a drought i had to leave			0
" farmer @entity71 told us who has lived in the area his whole life			2
" i had to work as a laborer in @entity77 to make ends meet			0
there was no way i could earn any money here			0
" that meant leaving his wife behind to raise their children and try to keep them fed. " if there is a harvest we benefit from the farm			0
" his wife @entity90 his wife says			0
" and if there is no harvest we get nothing			0
" for 10 years @entity71 worked as a snack seller in @entity77 sending back money to help his family survive			2
he says that all changed after @entity9 and his organization @entity98 showed up			1
the group came to teach the villagers something their forefathers once practiced : the building of traditional dams called @entity105			0
the dams are made of earth and rock			2
they are fashioned to capture the rain so the water will trickle down and replenish the aquifer eventually giving rise to water in the wells and bringing dead rivers back to life			1
but the work takes a community effort			0
one family is not enough to get it done			0
@entity9 says his role is to teach and motivate the community			1
" there are more than 10 - thousand water harvesting structures we [ have ] made in last 25 years			1
and all these structures came through the community effort			2
i just motivate and realize to the community and [ the ] community joined hands with us and they made it ! " it is easy to see the result when water becomes available again			1
everything from water buffalo to majestic peacocks			2
water snakes gather at the watering holes			2
over the years @entity9 says his organization and the villagers of @entity0 have revived seven rivers across the state helping more than a thousand villages			1
now instead of traveling long distances carrying heavy vats of water , or migrating to the cities to make a living , the villagers can stay put and begin to enjoy their surroundings more			2
the availability of water brought the @entity71 family back together again because the husband could finally make a living here			2
" i have planted many kinds of trees			0
for my livelihood i do farming			0
" he says " my family and i are leading very peaceful lives			0

@entity9 has *devoted* his life to solving @entity0 's water problems
@entity0 is @entity1 's largest state and also one of the driest
@entity9 says rainwater is a resource we can not afford to waste
ten thousand water harvesting structures have been made in the last 25 years
