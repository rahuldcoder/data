@entity0 -- the nation 's airlines asked a federal court on friday to stop the imminent furlough of air traffic controllers , saying the cuts could delay 6,700 flights daily with passengers waiting up to four hours in some cases			1
the @entity11 is beginning the furloughs on sunday as part of government - wide spending cuts that took effect in march due to inaction by @entity18 on a plan to cut the deficit			1
the @entity11 said the impact of the furloughs could be felt as early as monday			2
furloughs are hitting other agencies as well			0
while both sides agree furloughs would lead to substantial flight delays , the @entity11 and the airlines disagree on whether they are necessary			1
the @entity11 says it must furlough all 47,000 of its employees , including 15,000 air traffic controllers , as part of $ 637 million in planned spending cuts by september 30 , the end of the government 's fiscal year			1
the @entity11 's annual budget is $ 16 billion			2
" we can not avoid furloughs , " transportation secretary @entity39 said this week			0
but the airlines said that step is " based on a false legal premise -- that @entity18 has required the precise cuts that ( the @entity11 has ) ordered			1
however , the @entity48 does nothing of the sort , " the airlines argued in court papers			0
the agency could cut elsewhere and spare the traveling public the acute pain it will feel when controllers stay home , the carriers said			0
the motion was filed in the @entity58 by @entity59 , the trade association representing major airlines , the @entity61 , and the @entity62 , a group representing unionized pilots			0
they are challenging the @entity11 , which oversees air traffic operations and aviation safety in the @entity68 , and its parent agency , the @entity69			1
the airlines said it would push for congressional legislation deeming air controllers " essential " employees , which would exempt them from furloughs			1
it has asked the @entity80 administration for a 30 - day delay of its furlough action so it could pursue the matter with @entity18			0
" we continue to believe that the @entity11 has other means to reach a 10 percent budget reduction than to impact the traveling public , " @entity59 president @entity85 said in a statement			2
" when a company needs to make a 10 percent budget reduction , the answer is not to make it is so inefficient that no one wants to do business with it anymore			0
that 's essentially what the @entity11 is proposing , " he said			0
a coalition of aviation associations also has called on the @entity102 to give the @entity11 funding flexibility			2
" while other federal agencies , such as the @entity109 ( @entity109 ) , @entity110 ( @entity111 ) , @entity112 ( @entity113 ) and @entity114 ( @entity115 ) , have taken steps to avoid furloughing their essential operational personnel , the @entity11 believes they have not been given the same flexibility , " the group wrote in a letter to @entity102 chief of staff @entity106 .			1
