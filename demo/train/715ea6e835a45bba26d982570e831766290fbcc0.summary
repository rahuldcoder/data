-- for those out there worried that our nation 's stern gun laws were keeping firearms out of the hands of too many people , the solution appears to have arrived : the printable gun			2
produced by a nonprofit organization called @entity12 , this small plastic gun , dubbed the " @entity14 , " has been tested and is able to fire a bullet in a video demo			1
assuming this is no crazy hoax , the ramifications of such a weapon for gun control are potentially profound			1
i ca n't imagine that too many people with rational minds think printable guns will add to the serenity of the world			1
granted , 3 - d printers are n't yet a household item , but as technology improves and becomes less expensive , they may become common			1
although the " liberator " appears unreliable , tending to fragment after a few shots , subsequent models will likely improve			0
either way , it 's a workable and untraceable gun			1
open source guru @entity38 has said , " i approve of any development that makes it more difficult for governments and criminals to monopolize the use of force			0
" the development of the printable gun seems to be particularly popular with the ultra-libertarian crowd			2
the founder of @entity12 apparently describes himself as a crypto - anarchist			2
it 's difficult to envision a situation in which a law - abiding homeowner prints a gun for self - defense			1
sure , a few people may print the darn things for the novelty of it			2
but the printable gun , assuming it moves forward unregulated , would be the obvious realm of the criminal			1
ca n't pass a background check ? no need to take your chances , such as they are , at a gun show anymore			1
just print out your weapon from home ! as only the firing pin is metal ( a household nail ) , i can only imagine the nightmare of trying to detect these things			1
most homicides are impulsive , not the cold calculated affairs of @entity78 novels			0
would enraged individuals without a gun be able to print one of these in response to some perceived slight ? yes , they 'd have to go buy a bullet ( and a nail ) , but it 's still a way around a background check			1
this scenario seems foolish only because it 's already so easy to get a real gun			1
there are approximately 300 million guns in the @entity91			2
if we want to reduce the number of homicides ( or suicides for that matter ) , making it difficult to get immediate access to guns can help reduce impulsive behaviors			2
allowing people to print their own gun is just the opposite			1
beyond a doubt , calmer heads will want to regulate these things			2
i 'm not a lawyer , but i suspect this is one example in which technology may have raced ahead of the law			0
is @entity12 selling guns or information ? is this a gun control issue or a @entity116 issue ? can the printers be regulated to refuse to print weapons , or could new designs simply circumvent existing prohibited products ? sen. @entity121 , d - @entity122 , has expressed interest in legislation to block printable guns , so we 'll see where it leads			1
as he puts it , " we 're facing a situation where anyone -- a felon , a terrorist -- can open a gun factory in their garage and the weapons they make will be undetectable			1
it 's stomach - churning			0
" it seems that way			0
do n't get me wrong			0
i 'm probably about as neutral as anyone can be on the issue of gun control			0
i believe law abiding citizens have constitutional rights to own weapons			0
but at the same time i believe in reasonable safeguards to make sure access to firearms is limited from criminals and those with chronic mental illnesses			0
in this sense , to me , printable guns are a step in the wrong direction			0
granted , the actual impact of printable guns on societal violence is obviously unknown			0
perhaps they 'll remain so unreliable or difficult to assemble from the individual pieces that the impact will be negligible			0
some have described @entity12 's efforts as a kind of political performance art. very funny , @entity12			0
i just hope we do n't regret it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			2

a group used 3 - d printer to make a plastic handgun that can fire a real bullet
@entity180 : the ramifications of such a weapon are potentially profound
he says if a criminal ca n't pass a background check , he can just print his own gun at home
@entity173 : how will government regulate these workable and untraceable guns ?
