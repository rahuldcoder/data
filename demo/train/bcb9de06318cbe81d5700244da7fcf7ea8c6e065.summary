-- on any day , between 5 million and 6 million containers are on the high seas , carrying everything from potato chips to refrigerators			1
but not all of them make it to their destination , as the crew of the @entity11 have just found out			1
their @entity13 - flagged ship was in the @entity14 last week as hurricane - force winds battered the @entity17 coast of @entity18			1
amid waves of 30 feet and winds of 60 knots , the @entity19 began losing containers off northern @entity24			1
after the ship arrived in the @entity27 port of @entity28 this week , @entity11 discovered that about 520 containers were unaccounted for			1
stacks of others had collapsed			0
it 's the biggest recorded loss of containers overboard in a single incident			2
as repairs are made to the @entity19 in @entity28 , @entity36 , @entity11 's vice president of operations , says the company is examining its procedures " to avoid similar incidents in the future			1
" the company told @entity0 that the extreme weather had an unexpectedly forceful impact on the ship 's movements			2
it said 85 % of the lost containers were empty and others included such dry goods as frozen meat			2
@entity11 is now contacting customers to tell them that their shipments are at the bottom of the ocean			1
the @entity19 , which was on its way from @entity59 in the @entity60 to @entity61 in @entity62 via the @entity63 , warned @entity24 maritime authorities that vessels should look out for floating containers , but most sank quickly in the mountainous seas			1
thirteen have now been recovered , according to @entity24 officials			0
the @entity24 environmental group @entity71 said friday it would sue @entity11 for failing to disclose the full extent of the loss when it occurred , putting the lives of others in danger , causing pollution and abandoning waste at sea			1
the group claimed the containers were a lasting danger to fishing vessels and the environment			1
most containers wo n't float for long , especially in heavy seas			2
but one that is refrigerated may be buoyed by its insulation , and the use of polystyrene as packaging for goods also aids flotation			0
@entity99 marine insurer @entity97 says a 20 - foot container can float for up to two months , and a 40 - foot container might float more than three times as long			0
cargo spills and shipping hazards these rogue containers can pose a danger to shipping and pollute the environment			1
in 2006 , thousands of bags of @entity111 chips washed up on the beaches of @entity114 's @entity113 -- much to the delight of local gulls -- after the container carrying them split apart in the @entity17			0
more famously , in 1992 , a container broke apart off the coast of @entity121 , and 29,000 plastic ducks and frogs escaped			0
they 've been washing up as far away as @entity125 and @entity126 ever since			0
there is no requirement on shipping lines to report container losses to the @entity131 or other international body , so no one seems to know how many containers are lost at sea every year			1
in 2011 , the @entity136 estimated that including " catastrophic losses " such as the capsizing of a vessel , about 675 containers were lost at sea annually			2
the through @entity142 , which insures 15 of the top 20 container lines , has put the loss at fewer than 2,000 containers a year			1
but other industry sources say the number may be as high as 10,000			2
that would still represent far less than 1 % of the containers traversing the world 's oceans			2
@entity152 , one of the world 's largest lines , says that its highest annual loss in the last decade was 59 containers			2
but the hazard is still real enough			0
in recent years , several small vessels have reported damage after hitting semi-submerged containers			2
during his solo voyage around the world , @entity163 sailor @entity162 wrote that " one night in the @entity166 , i hit a waterlogged shipping container that was too low in the water to show up on radar			0
" his 31 - foot boat was damaged but stayed afloat			0
container weight an issue shipping analysts say that one issue affecting the stability of container stacks is that the steel boxes -- 20 to 40 feet long -- are not accurately weighed			1
they say some shippers frequently understate the weight of their containers to reduce freight charges			0
not knowing how much your cargo weighs can introduce all sorts of problems in terms of the stress a vessel must endure at sea			0
three years ago , a proposal was put to the @entity131 for containers to be weighed before being loaded			1
but nothing has been agreed , and many shipping associations object to such a proposal as expensive and time - consuming			1
even so , one current investigation may focus more attention on the loading of containers			1
last june , the 90,000 - ton @entity200 literally snapped in half 200 miles off the coast of @entity202			0
the ship , built in @entity126 , was only 5 years old			0
both sections of the @entity200 , as well as 4,500 containers , went to the ocean floor			0
one factor being investigated is whether uneven loading of containers contributed to intolerable stresses on the hull			1
it would not be the first such disaster			0
seven years ago , the 62,000 - ton @entity214 suffered catastrophic hull failure and ran aground off the @entity217 coast			0
a report by the @entity220 @entity219 concluded that inaccurate information about container weights could have been critical , given that cargo ships often sail close to their maximum permissible " bending moments , " which measure the external stress on a vessel			0
the investigation recommended that " if the stresses acting on container ships are to be accurately controlled , it is essential that containers are weighed before embarkation " and criticized the industry 's " overriding desire " to maintain schedules and keep port time to a minimum			1
the cost of salvage and cargo came to nearly $ 200 million			0
an interim report into the sinking of the @entity200 by the @entity243 -- published in december -- also called for the weight of containers to be verified before loading to reduce uncertainty about ships ' bending moments			1
but a definitive answer to the @entity200 's demise may never be known , as much of the evidence lies deep under the @entity166 's waves			0
shipping containers offer housing solution			2

high wind and waves struck the @entity11 in the @entity14 last week
about 520 containers were unaccounted for after the ship arrived at a @entity27 port
such rogue containers can pose a danger to shipping and pollute the environment
a proposal put to a maritime group calls for containers to be weighed before loading
