a controversial referendum on @entity2 's future as part of @entity4 has again been put on hold by a court , just days before the planned vote on sunday			1
@entity4 's @entity8 on tuesday suspended -- for the second time since september -- a referendum on independence for @entity2 , the wealthy , restive region in northeast @entity4 whose capital is @entity14			1
the court said in a statement that it again suspended the referendum while it considers an appeal from the @entity4 government that challenged the independence vote as " unconstitutional			1
" hundreds of thousands of @entity21 have demonstrated in recent years for an independence referendum , and they closely watched the recent independence vote in @entity25			1
even after @entity25 voted to remain a part of the @entity27 , many @entity21 said the key issue was being allowed to vote in @entity2 on independence			2
but the @entity4 government insists that the constitution does not permit just one of @entity4 's 17 regions , such as @entity2 , to unilaterally break away			1
@entity2 represents about 20 % of @entity4 's economy and already has broad home - rule powers , including its own parliament , police force and control over education and health			0
the region also has a long list of grievances with @entity43 , including over taxation			0
the first showdown came in september , after the @entity47 regional parliament approved a law allowing referendums , and then a decree by the @entity47 president set november 9 as the date			0
the @entity4 government appealed and the @entity53 accepted that for study , effectively suspending the vote			1
next , the @entity47 president said there would still be a referendum , but it would be less formal , so it would be permissible under the law			0
it would be called a " consultation , " and would be conducted by volunteers at polling places , instead of the usual electoral officials			0
the court has now suspended that as well			0
yet preparations continue for holding some kind of vote on sunday in @entity2			0
citizens groups which have pushed hard to hold the referendum , and which also favor independence , sent notifications on tuesday to news media about where to pick up accreditations in @entity14 in order to follow the election results on sunday night			0
polls indicate that a majority of @entity21 want to have a chance to vote			2
some polls show that less than a majority would vote for independence , given the chance			1
but a survey last week by the @entity47 government 's polling center predicted a very close fight , with 49.4 % saying they would vote to break away from @entity4 .			2

the court 's *decision* is the second time the vote has been suspended
the @entity4 government calls the referendum unconstitutional
polls show @entity21 want a chance to vote , but might not vote for independence
